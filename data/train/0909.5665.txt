    "in the present work a special class of vekua equations describing generalized analytic or pseudoanalytic functions is considered .",
    "it arises naturally in relation with some linear equations of mathematical physics such as the stationary schrdinger equation , the conductivity equation and others .",
    "vekua equations of this type we call main vekua equations .",
    "they are closely related to another generalization of the cauchy - riemann system , the system describing so - called @xmath0-analytic functions ( see the definitions in the next section ) .",
    "the general pseudoanalytic function theory mainly created by l. bers and his coauthors and presented in @xcite among other developments contains deep results on generalizations of the concept of complex differentiability and integrability , taylor and laurent series related to generalized analytic functions as well as the generalizations of the cauchy integral formula and its corollaries . in the core of bers theory",
    "there is a concept of a generating sequence related to a vekua equation . in general",
    "a derivative of a generalized analytic function in the sense introduced by bers is not any more a solution of the same vekua equation but of another vekua equation called a successor of the original one .",
    "bers derivatives of solutions of this second vekua equation will solve another vekua equation , and in principle this sequence of vekua equations related to the original one is infinite . if somehow one manages to obtain a pair of solutions in a certain sense independent for each of these vekua equations then such sequence of pairs is called the generating sequence and it immediately allows one to construct a complete system of positive formal powers related to the original vekua equation .",
    "the formal powers are basic constituents of the taylor - type series expansions of the pseudoanalytic functions and generalize the usual powers @xmath1 in the sense that being a solution of the vekua equation a formal power of order @xmath2 asymptotically behaves like @xmath1 when @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , theorems generalizing such facts like the runge theorem on the completeness of the system of powers  in a uniform convergence topology and even stronger results guaranteeing the completeness in the @xmath4-norm were obtained in the framework of pseudoanalytic function theory .",
    "one of the most significant obstacles for the further development and a broader application of pseudoanalytic function theory is the explicit construction of generating sequences , formal powers and cauchy kernels corresponding to vekua equations arising in applications .",
    "bers himself and together with gelbart succeeded in constructing a generating sequence in a very special case ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . in @xcite an algorithm for explicit construction of a generating sequence was proposed for a much more general situation . in application to second - order elliptic equations with the aid of the tools from pseudoanalytic function theory",
    "this result allows one to obtain a complete system of solutions of the equation , e.g. , of the schrdinger equation when the equation possesses a particular solution @xmath5 in a separable form @xmath6 where @xmath7 are orthogonal coordinates and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are arbitrary sufficiently smooth functions .    in the present paper",
    "we substantially extend the class of vekua equations and of systems desribing @xmath0-analytic functions for which a generating sequence and a system of formal powers can be constructed explicitly .",
    "for this we use a concept introduced in @xcite and called there the transplant operator .",
    "in fact , it is an operator transforming solutions of one vekua equation into solutions of another one related to the first via a schrdinger equation .",
    "here we prove a crucial property of the transplant operator : it transforms formal powers into formal powers of the same order ( see details in section [ secttransplant ] ) .",
    "this means that if we are able to solve a vekua equation , that is we know its generating sequence then using the transplant operator we can construct positive formal powers and a generating sequence for a related vekua equation which can be much more complicated . as an example in section [ sectpositiveformalpowers ] we consider a vekua equation whose generating sequence is periodic with a period 1 , that is it consists of one generating pair only . in this case",
    "it is relatively easy to obtain the corresponding positive formal powers . then using the approach described in the present work , it is possible to obtain systems of positive formal powers and generating sequences for a wide class of vekua equations related to the first one . the structure of generating sequences and of formal powers for the related vekua equations are more complicated .",
    "we also obtain a similar result regarding the construction of cauchy kernels as we show in section [ sectcauchykernels ] .",
    "if a cauchy kernel for a vekua equation is known , it can be used for constructing cauchy kernels for a wide class of related vekua equations using the transplant operator .",
    "all the described results have a direct application to linear second - order equations .",
    "for example , in the case of the stationary two - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath10 with @xmath11 and @xmath12 being real valued , the existence of one solution @xmath12 such that a generating sequence for an associated main vekua equation can be constructed explicitly leads not only to the construction of a complete system of solutions to this schrdinger equation but also to the construction of complete systems of solutions to any schrdinger equation with the potential @xmath13 where @xmath5 is any solution of the original schrdinger equation with the potential @xmath11 .",
    "note that the form of the potential @xmath14 is a precise generalization of the potential obtained after a darboux transformation in a one - dimensional case ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath15 be a domain in @xmath16 . throughout the whole paper",
    "we suppose that @xmath15 is a simply connected domain .    in the present work we consider two related generalized cauchy - riemann systems .",
    "the first defines so - called @xmath0-analytic functions @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and has the following form @xmath17 where @xmath0 is a given positive function of two real variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 which is supposed to be continuously differentiable ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 are real - valued continuously differentiable functions .",
    "if @xmath20 and @xmath21 are solutions of this system in @xmath15 , then the complex function @xmath22 of a complex variable @xmath23 is said to be @xmath0-analytic in @xmath15 .",
    "the second system considered here represents a special case of a general vekua equation ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and sometimes is referred to as the main vekua equation @xcite .",
    "it has the form @xmath24 where the subindex @xmath25 means the application of the operator @xmath26 , @xmath27 is a continuously differentiable complex valued function , @xmath5 is a positive function of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , twice continuously differentiable , which will be supposed to be a particular solution of some stationary schrdinger equation @xmath28 that is @xmath29 .    systems ( [ p - anal ] ) and ( [ vekuamaina ] ) are equivalent @xcite , @xcite in the following sense . denote @xmath30 where @xmath4 is the operator of complex conjugation .",
    "we suppose that @xmath31 and introduce the operator @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the identity operator .",
    "we have that the equation @xmath35 is equivalent to the system@xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .    denote @xmath39",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath40    [ prrelation]@xcite@xmath41    from proposition [ prrelation ] we have also that@xmath42    thus , application of the operator @xmath43 or @xmath44 respectively allows us to establish a direct relation between the results corresponding to ( [ p - anal ] ) and ( [ vekuamaina ] ) .",
    "the following factorization of the schrdinger operator will be used .",
    "@xcite [ thfact]let @xmath5 be a positive in @xmath15 particular solution of ( [ schrod ] ) .",
    "then for any real valued function @xmath45 the following equalities hold@xmath46    an immediate corollary of this theorem is the fact that if @xmath27 is a solution of ( [ vekuamaina ] ) then its real part @xmath47 is necessarily a solution of ( [ schrod ] ) , meanwhile its imaginary part @xmath48 is a solution of the following schrdinger equation@xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , given @xmath47 , the corresponding @xmath48 can be easily constructed and vice versa . in order to formulate this result we need to introduce the following notation .",
    "note that the operator @xmath52 applied to a real - valued function @xmath53 can be regarded as a kind of gradient , and if we know that @xmath54 in a whole complex plane or in a convex domain , where @xmath55 is a given complex valued function such that its real part @xmath56 and imaginary part @xmath57 satisfy the equation @xmath58 then we can reconstruct @xmath53 up to an arbitrary real constant @xmath59 in the following way@xmath60 where @xmath61 is an arbitrary fixed point in the domain of interest .",
