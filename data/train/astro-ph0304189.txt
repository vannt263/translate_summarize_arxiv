    "the recent discovery of high redshift quasars with @xmath1 ( fan et al .",
    "2001 ) implies that the formation of supermassive black holes proceeded in less than @xmath2 yr . also , the recent compilation of the kinematical data of galactic centers in both active and inactive galaxies has shown that a central massive dark object ( mdo ) , which is the nomenclature for a black hole ( bh ) candidate , correlates with the properties of galactic bulges .",
    "the demography of mdos have revealed the following relations :      \\1 ) the bh mass exhibits a linear relation to the bulge mass with the ratio of @xmath3 as a median value ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; richstone et al .",
    "1998 ; magorrian et al . 1998 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001a ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ) .",
    "\\2 ) the bh mass correlates with the velocity dispersion of bulge stars with a power - law relation as @xmath4 , @xmath5 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000b ) , 4.72 ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001a , b ) , or @xmath6 ( tremaine et al . 2002 ) .",
    "\\6 ) the @xmath7 in seyfert 1 galaxies is not well converged , which may be considerably smaller than 0.001 ( wandel 1999 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ) or similar to that for ellipticals ( mclure & dunlop 2002 ) , while the bh mass - to - velocity dispersion relation in seyfert 1 galaxies seems to hold in a similar way to elliptical galaxies ( gebhardt et al .",
    "2000a ; nelson 2000 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the x - ray emission ( brandt et al . 1997 ) or pa@xmath8 lines ( veilleux , sanders , & kim 1999 ) intrinsic for active nuclei have been detected in roughly one forth of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "furhtermore , it has been revealed that qso host galaxies are mostly luminous and well evolved early - type galaxies ( mcleod & rieke 1995 ; bahcall et al .",
    "1997 ; hooper , impey , & foltz 1997 ; mcleod , rieke , & storrie - lombardi 1999 ; brotherton et al .",
    "1999 ; kirhakos et al . 1999 ; mclure et al . 1999 ; mclure , dunlop , & kukula 2000 ) .",
    "all these findings on qso hosts and supermassive bhs imply that the formation of a qso , a bulge , and a supermassive bh is mutually related .",
    "some theoretical models have been hitherto considered to explain the bh - to - bulge correlations ( silk & rees 1998 ; adams , graff , & richstone 2001 ; ostriker 2000 ) .",
    "but , little has been elucidated regarding the physics on the angular momentum transfer which is requisite for bh formation , since the rotation barrier by the tidal spin up in a growing density fluctuation is given by @xmath9 in units of the schwarzshild radius @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the baryonic mass , @xmath12 is the cosmological redshift , and @xmath13 is the spin parameter which provides the ratio of circular velocity to velocity dispersion of dark matter ( umemura 2001 ) . furthermore , required mechanisms for bh formation must work effectively in a spheroidal system like a bulge .",
    "the @xmath8-viscosity or non - axisymmetric gravitational instabilities would effectively transfer angular momentum once a disk - like system forms , but they are not likely to work in a spheroidal system .    in this paper , as a potential mechanism that works in a spheroidal system , the relativistic drag force by the radiation from bulge stars is considered . as a result , the bh - to - bulge ratio is basically determined by the energy conversion efficiency for nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium , @xmath0 .",
    "also , in relation to bh growth , a new scenario for qso formation is addressed .",
    "a radiation hydrodynamic model which could account for the putative correlations between smbhs and bulges is recently proposed by umemura ( 2001 ) , where the relativistic drag force by the radiation from bulge stars is considered .",
    "the radiation drag can extract angular momentum from gas and allow the gas to accrete onto the center ( umemura , fukue , & mineshige 1997 , 1998 ; fukue , umemura , & mineshige 1997 ) .",
    "for the total luminosity @xmath14 of a uniform bulge , the radiation energy density is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the light speed and @xmath17 is the radius of the bulge .",
    "then , the angular momentum loss rate by the radiation drag is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total angular momentum of gaseous component and @xmath20 is the mass extinction coefficient which is given by @xmath21 with dust absorption coefficient @xmath22 and gas density @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , in an optically - thin regime , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total optical depth of the system and @xmath26 is the total mass of gas . in an optically - thick regime , the radiation drag efficiency",
    "is saturated due to the conservation of the photon number ( tsuribe & umemura 1997 ) .",
    "thus , an expression of the angular momentum loss rate which includes both regimes is given by @xmath27 then , the mass accretion rate is estimated to be @xmath28 in an optically - thick regime , this gives simply @xmath29 which is numerically @xmath30 this rate is comparable to the eddington mass accretion rate for a black hole with @xmath31 , that is , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the energy conversion efficiency .",
    "unless otherwise stated , @xmath34 for an extreme kerr black hole is assumed .",
    "the timescale of radiation drag - induced mass accretion is @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the metallicity of gas .",
    "it is noted that the gas which is more abundant in metals accretes in a shorter timescale , because the extinction is predominantly given by the dust opacity . for the moment , an optically - thick stage is considered . due to the mass accretion induced by the radiation drag , a massive dark object ( mdo ) forms at the center of bulge .",
    "then , the mass of mdo is estimated in terms of @xmath38 in practice , it is likely that optically - thin surface layers are stripped from optically - thick clumpy clouds by the radiation drag , and the stripped gas losing angular momentum accretes onto the center ( kawakatu & umemura 2002 ) .",
    "next , we employ a simplest analytic model for bulge evolution .",
    "the star formation rate is assumed to be a schmidt law , @xmath39 .",
    "if we invoke the instantaneous recycling approximation , the star formation rate is given by @xmath40 where @xmath8 is the net efficiency of the conversion into stars after subtracting the mass loss .",
    "the radiation energy emitted by a main sequence star is @xmath41 to the rest mass energy of the star , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the energy conversion efficiency of nuclear fusion from hydrogen to helium , which is 0.007 .",
    "thus , the luminosity of the bulge is estimated to be @xmath44 by substituting this in ( [ m - mdo ] ) , @xmath45 the term @xmath46 represents just the stellar mass in the system which is @xmath47 observationally . as a consequence ,",
    "the mdo mass to bulge mass ratio is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "it should be noted that the final mass is basically determined by @xmath43 .",
    "also , the proportionality of smbh mass to bulge mass is a natural consequence in the present mechanism .          in the above , the prediction for the mdo - to - bulge mass relation is made in the context of radiation drag - induced mass accretion .",
    "however , the mdo itself is not a supermassive black hole , because the radiation drag is not likely to remove the angular momentum thoroughly , but some residual angular momentum will terminate the radial contraction .",
    "hence , we should consider the further collapse of the mdo through other physical mechanisms .    in the mdo , the viscosity is expected to work effectively because the timescale for viscous accretion , @xmath50 , is shortened by the radiation drag , where @xmath51 is the specific angular momentum , @xmath52 is the viscous parameter , and @xmath53 is the sound velocity .",
    "thus , the mdo is likely to be a massive self - gravitating viscous disk . for a self - gravitating viscous disk ,",
    "some self - similar solutions are known to give an inside - out disk collapse ( mineshige & umemura 1996 ; mineshige & umemura 1997 ; tsuribe 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , tsuribe ( 1999 ) provided a convenient formula for the inside - out mass accretion rate , @xmath54 where @xmath53 is the sound speed and @xmath55 is the toomre s q which is @xmath56 for the epicycle frequency @xmath57 and the surface density @xmath58 .",
    "tsuribe ( 1999 ) has found a solution of stable accretion with @xmath59 .",
    "the critical accretion rate is given by @xmath60 this rate is again comparable to the eddington mass accretion rate for a black hole with @xmath31 if @xmath61k [ see ( [ m - dot - edd ] ) ] . through this inside - out collapse",
    ", a central core grows .",
    "the core is expected to be a rigidly rotating supermassive star because the viscous transfer of angular momentum works to smear out any differential rotation in a self - gravitating system .    the equilibrium configuration and the stability of a rigidly rotating supermassive star has been scrutinized by baumgarte & shapiro ( 1999 ) .",
    "they found that a rotating supermassive star becomes unstable for @xmath62 .",
    "as for the dynamical collapse of a rotating supermassive star , saijo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) performed post - newtonian calculations and found that if a rotating supermassive star is in rigid rotation , it can collapse towards the horizon scale without undergoing bar - mode instability .",
    "the final stage of the collapse was investigated by shibata & shapiro ( 2002 ) with a full general relativistic approach and the emergence of an apparent horizon of a kerr black hole was shown .",
    "the resultant spin parameter of the black hole is around 0.75 .",
    "hence , an mdo formed by radiation drag - induced mass accretion could evolve into a supermassive kerr black hole through the inside - out viscous collapse and the general relativistic instability .",
    "the present picture for the formation of a supermassive black hole is summarized in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "if the bh accretion causes the nuclear activity , the further radiative mass accretion can be induced by the nuclear luminosity @xmath63 .",
    "this feedback works positively to grow the smbh .",
    "consequently , it is predicted that the bh mass to bulge mass ratio becomes @xmath64 this is just comparable to the observed ratio .      if the bh mass is determined by the present mechanism , the bh mass to velocity dispersion relation is naturally understood in the context of a cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology . supposing the bulge is a virialized system , then @xmath66 and @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the radius at the maximum expansion epoch @xmath69 .",
    "if a cdm cosmology is assumed , then @xmath70 where @xmath71 around @xmath72 , almost regardless of the cosmological parameters ( bunn & white 1997 ) .",
    "combining all these relations , we find @xmath73 with @xmath74 , which is 4 for @xmath75 .",
    "this result is just corresponding to the inferred relation between the bh mass and the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "the radiation drag efficiency could be strongly subject to the effect of geometrical dilution ( umemura , fukue , & mineshige 1998 ) .",
    "if the system is spherical , the emitted photons are effectively consumed within the system , whereas a large fraction of photons can escape from a disk - like system and also the drag efficiency is considerably reduced across the optically - thick disk .",
    "this may be the reason why @xmath7 is observed to be significantly smaller than 0.001 in disk systems .      in the present model ,",
    "the theoretical upper limit of @xmath76 is @xmath0 .",
    "the low mass end of the bh hierarchy is suggested by the recent observations on massive bhs in globular clusters , e.g. , @xmath77 in g1 ( gebhardt , rich , & ho 2002 ) and @xmath78 in m15 ( van der marel et al . 2002 ; gessen et al . 2002 ) .",
    "it is found that @xmath65 relation still holds in such small spheroidal systems .",
    "the present radiation hydrodynamic mechanism is expected to work in forming a bh even in a small spheroidal system , if the system retains interstellar medium ( ism ) sufficient to become optically thick .",
    "although in globular clusters a few supernovae can easily expel the ism in an early evolutionary phase , the mass loss from low mass stars in later phases may accumulate a sufficient ism . on the other hand",
    ", m33 appears not to have a massive bh with an upper limit of @xmath79 ( gebhardt et al .",
    "an intriguing difference is that m33 contains a significant population of stars younger than a few gyrs ( e.g. , oconnell 1983 ) , in contrast to other globular clusters which possess massive bhs .",
    "thus , m33 might not have been able to retain a sufficient ism owing to successive supernova explosions . in other words ,",
    "the bh mass in globular clusters may sensitively reflect its star formation history .",
    "as for the high mass end of the bh hierarchy , whether hypermassive bhs in clusters of galaxies exist is a crucial test . in galaxy clusters , it is not likely that optically - thick intracluster medium is supplied by galactic winds or stripping of ism .",
    "hence , in the present scenario , hypermassive bhs will not form in the centers of galaxy clusters . therefore ,",
    "the bh hierarchy is predicted to be cut off at the maximum size in galaxies , @xmath80 .     and",
    "@xmath63 are the bulge luminosity and the black hole accretion luminosity , respectively .",
    "@xmath81 is the mass of smbh .",
    "the ordinary qso phase is preceded by a host luminosity - dominant `` proto - qso phase''.,width=453 ]          here , we construct a picture of qso formation based on the present scenario for smbh formation .",
    "if the mass accretion driven by the viscosity on to the bh horizon is determined by an order of eddington rate , the bh mass grows according to @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the ratio of bh accretion rate to the eddington rate and @xmath84 is the eddington timescale , @xmath85yr .",
    "@xmath86 is the mass of a seed bh with @xmath87 ( shibata & shapiro 2002 ) . in order to incorporate the chemical evolution of host galaxy",
    ", we use an evolutionary spectral synthesis code pegase ( fioc & rocca - volmerange 1997 ) , and also employ a galactic wind model with the wind epoch of @xmath88yr to match the present - day color - magnitude relation ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ) .",
    "the system is assumed to change from optically - thick to optically - thin phase at @xmath89 .",
    "based on the present coevolution model , the evolution of bulge luminosity ( @xmath90 ) , the agn luminosity ( @xmath63 ) , and the mass of smbh ( @xmath81 ) are shown in figure [ fig2 ] , assuming the constant eddington ratio ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "the @xmath81 reaches @xmath92 at a time @xmath93 , so that the bh fraction becomes @xmath94 , which is just comparable to the observed ratio .    in the optically - thin phase after the galactic wind ( @xmath95 )",
    ", @xmath81 still continues to grow until @xmath93 and therefore the agn brightens with time .",
    "after @xmath63 exhibits a peak at @xmath93 , it fades out abruptly due to exhausting the fuel of the mdo .",
    "this fading nucleus could be a low luminosity agn ( llagn ) .",
    "it is found that the era of @xmath96 can be divided into two phases with a transition time @xmath97 when @xmath98 ; the earlier phase is the host luminosity - dominant phase and the later phase is the agn luminosity - dominant phase .",
    "the lifetimes of both phases are comparable to each other , which is about @xmath99yr .",
    "the agn - dominant phase is likely to correspond to ordinary qsos , while the host - dominant phase is obviously different from observed qsos so far .",
    "we define this phase as `` a proto - qso '' ( kawakatu & umemura 2003 ) .",
    "the observable properties of proto - qsos are predicted as follows : ( 1 ) the width of broad emission line is narrower , which is less than @xmath100km / s . ( 2 ) @xmath7 rapidly increases from @xmath101 to @xmath102 in @xmath103 years .",
    "( 3 ) the colors of @xmath104 at rest bands and @xmath105 at observed bands are about 0.5 magnitude bluer than those of qsos .",
    "( 4 ) in both proto - qso and qso phases , the metallicity of gas in galactic nuclei is @xmath106 , and that of stars weighted by the host luminosity is @xmath107 , which are consistent with the observations for qsos and the elliptical galaxies . ( 5 ) a massive dusty disk ( @xmath108 ) surrounds a massive bh , and it may obscure the nucleus in the edge - on view to form a type 2 nucleus .",
    "the predicted properties of proto - qsos are quite similar to those of radio galaxies at high redshifts .",
    "thus , high-@xmath12 radio galaxies are a key candidate for proto - qsos .",
    "the proto - qso phase is preceded by a bright and optically thick phase , which may correspond to a ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) phase .",
    "also , the precursor of ulirgs is an optically - thin and very luminous phase with the lifetime of @xmath109 years .",
    "this may correspond to the assembly phase of lbgs or ly@xmath8 emitters . in this phase ,",
    "the metallicity is subsolar ( @xmath110 ) , and the hard x - ray luminosity is @xmath111 if @xmath112 .",
    "such a coevolution scenario of a smbh and the host is summarized in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "the smbh could form through the relativistic radiation - hydrodynamic processes from galactic scale to horizon scale .",
    "the resultant mass of a smbh is in proportion to the bulge mass , and the smbh mass fraction is determined by the nuclear energy conversion efficiency from hydrogen to helium , @xmath0 , which is the theoretical upper limit in the present mechanism .",
    "massive bhs can form also in globular clusters , but hypermassive bhs are unlikely to form in the centers of galaxy clusters . as for qso formation , it is predicted that a host luminosity - dominant `` proto - qso phase '' exists before the qso phase .",
    "the proto - qso is a phase of growing bh with broad emission line width of less than @xmath100km / s .",
    "the proto - qso phase is preceded by an optically - thick ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) phase . before the ulirg phase",
    ", an optically thin starburst phase should exist .",
