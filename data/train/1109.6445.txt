    "following @xcite , we derive the flux- and mass - weighted average ages , which are defined as @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the flux - weighted population vector ( i.e. , the fraction of flux contributed by certain ssp ) , and @xmath130 is the mass - weighted population vector .",
    "the average metallicities @xmath131z@xmath132@xmath133 and @xmath131z@xmath134@xmath133 can be derived similarly .",

    "nevertheless , the promising approach to break it remains the combined use of multiple absorption - line indices@xcite . in this section , we will measure the absorption lines of etgs in a671 and compare them with state - of - art ssp models in order to infer their ages , metallicities and @xmath4-enhancements .",
    "the bandpasses of the lick indices are defined in table 1 of @xcite .",

    "they found that the correlation between  and is much tighter .",
    "emission ews for higher order balmer lines are obtained from  by assuming standard values from balmer decrement ( in the absence of reddening ) . in this way , ew()@xmath138 ew ( ) , ew()@xmath139 ew ( ) , and ew()@xmath140 ew ( ) .",
    "our goal is to use the s07 model to derive the ssp - equivalent parameters .",
    "firstly we create grid to fit three parameters : ages , [ fe / h ] , and [ mg / fe ] .",
    "we use the solar - scaled isochrones and the salpeter initial mass function suggested by the ez@xmath136ages documents .",
    "the [ o / fe ] is set to be zero , and other @xmath4 elements are tied to mg .",
    "the ages range from 1.2 to 17.7 gyr , and the [ fe / h ] ranges from -1.3 to 0.2 .",
    "other details can be found in s07 , @xcite .",
    "the three parameters are derived following two steps : i ) for each galaxy , we firstly calculate age and [ fe / h ] using  and @xmath131fe@xmath133 , at all [ mg / fe ] ; ii ) we compare the pair @xmath131fe@xmath133 ( @xmath131fe@xmath133=0.5(fe5270+fe5335 ) ) and mgb with models at the median age obtained in the first step , and calculate a new [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] .",
    "we then update the ages by interpolating the ages found in the first step at the [ mg / fe ] derived in the second step , and iterate the second step with the new age .",
    "usually two iteration steps are needed before convergence . for those measurements beyond the model grids",
    ", we set the parameters to be the boundaries , i.e , the maximum or minimum of the models .    before deriving the stellar population parameters of our sample with the ssp models ,",
    "we compare our measurements to the predictions of each model on the grids of age and metallicity . in figure 11 ,",

    "galaxies which fall outside model boundary are not included in the figure .",
    "the parameter errors are given by the fitting procedure for each galaxy .",
    "we then compute an average error for each parameter by weighted the output error of individual galaxy with its signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "as presented in figure 11 , majority of the galaxies falling out of the model boundary are located in the core , which makes hard to investigate environmental effect . though only 46 etgs are able to be fitted by the model , the relations between the ssp parameters and velocity dispersion ( @xmath101 ) are still remarkable .    in the top - left panel of figure 12 ,",
    "the ssp ages show strong dependence upon velocity dispersion , and the low-@xmath101 galaxies span a wider age range , indicating that the low @xmath101 galaxies have various possibilities of star formation histories compared with the high-@xmath101 ones .",
    "similar results are found in the bright galaxies in coma by @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the ssp ages derived by s07 model are not compatible with the average stellar ages given by the starlight fitting .",
    "firstly , the ssp ages in starlight code range from 1 myr to 13 gyr , while the range of the ssp ages in s07 models is from 1 gyr to 17.7 gyr .",
    "the typical age of etgs from starlight fitting ( see figure 10 ) is older than 7 gyr . in figure 11 , the etg ages derived by the s07 model span a wider range .",
    "additionally , the starlight gives the best - fit ages without errors .",
    "the s07 model determines the ages by comparing several combined - indices with the theoretical model , and the measurement errors can strongly affect the output ages . for the galaxies",
    "whose indices locate near the model boundary , measurement errors of indices will bring in greater uncertainties in the parameter fitting .",
    "the top - middle and top - right panels display the relation of [ fe / h ] and [ mg / fe ] with @xmath101 .",
    "the [ fe / h]@xmath148 correlation is very tight , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath149 , whereas the [ mg / fe]@xmath148 correlation is rather weak .",
    "the former studies have found [ mg / fe ] strongly correlated with @xmath101 @xcite .",
    "we should keep in mind that the tightness and slope of linear correlation strongly depend on the sample size . considering our small sample size and the intrinsic scatter of this correlation ,",
    "a relatively weaker [ mg / fe]@xmath148 relation is still reasonable .    in the three bottom panels of figure 12 , we present [ c / fe]@xmath148 , [ n / fe]@xmath148 , and [ ca / fe]@xmath148 relations",
    ". only a weak correlation of [ n / fe]@xmath148 is found , with a correlation coefficient of @xmath150 .",
    "the results of our fitting are similar to those in @xcite , and their results are based on a large sample of about 6000 red sequence galaxies from the sdss .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of a671 based on the spectroscopically confirmed members , and the result of @xmath57-test strongly suggests that a671 has significant substructures .",
    "many authors have found that a large fraction of galaxy clusters have substructures @xcite , indicating that massive clusters may assemble their masses and grow up by accreting small groups .",
    "the contour map of member galaxies in a671 fits well with the x - ray intensity contour map .",
    "@xcite suggested that there are two substructures in a671 .",
    "location of one substructure is well associated with the potential substructure b , and the other is at the south part of cluster , which is not significant enough to be detected by the @xmath57-test .",
    "their substructure - finding algorithm is based on the projected positions of galaxies , and does not utilize the redshift information .",
    "73% of the clusters in their sample were found to have substructures , and this fraction is higher than most studies .",
    "their magnitude limit of galaxy samples is @xmath151@xmath152 , much fainter than our limiting magnitude @xmath80 , thus the projection effect can not be ignored , and some substructures they found could be untrue . after 97 newly selected galaxies included , the substructure b is enhanced , while another substructure appears less prominent .",
    "the follow - up spectroscopy of these faint galaxies is need for revealing the details of dynamical substructures in a671 .",
    "the remarkable morphology - density relation indicates that the cluster environment indeed have played an important role in evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "a visual inspection of the c - m diagram shows that a large fraction of bright member galaxies ( @xmath153 ) have evolved to be the `` red sequence '' , and faint member galaxies with @xmath154 are found to have considerable activities of star formation .",
    "when the galaxies are accreted into a cluster , their star formation activities are expected to be suppressed by some important processes , such as tidal stripping and `` harassment '' @xcite , ram pressure stripping of the gas disk @xcite , and removal of gas reservoir surrounding each galaxy @xcite .",
    "we derived the average ages and metallicities for member galaxies by fitting their spectra .",
    "the most remarkable feature of the age distribution is that the etgs in the core region have older ages than those in the outskirts . @xcite",
    "have found that the etgs in dense environment have average ages @xmath155 gyr older than those in field environment .",
    "they derived ages by comparing the lick indices with the prediction of tmb model .",
    "our results confirm their conclusion though the average ages are derived by different methods .",
    "this can be interpreted in two ways . on the one hand",
    ", theoretical work shows that dark matter halos in dense environments were assembled earlier than average @xcite . as a result , the galaxies in the core region of clusters formed earlier than those in the outer regions , and thus have older stellar ages . on the other hand , the older stellar age of the etgs in the core region",
    "could be explained by lack of recent star formation compared with those in the outer region .",
    "galaxy clusters have dense gas with high temperature , and the core - region galaxies lost their gas reservoirs by interacting with the dense intracluster medium ( icm ) ( usually by ram pressure stripping ) . thus the core - region galaxies should be gas - poor , and have less possibilities of recent star - formation . aside from age , the total metallicities of the etgs show subtle dependence on environment , which agrees well with @xcite . a larger sample of cluster etgs is needed to investigate the environmental effects on chemical evolution .",
    "the dependence of age upon stellar mass could be explainable in the downsizing scenario for galaxy formation @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "star formation lasts longer in less massive galaxies than in more massive galaxies .",
    "thus massive systems will have older ssp ages on average .",
    "evidences of downsizing effect in the local universe have been found by many recent studies on the stellar population of etgs @xcite .",
    "the age-@xmath101 slope in these studies span a range between 0.35 and 0.93 .",
    "the different slope values are mainly due to the different sample property ( e.g. , galaxy type , sample size , etc . ) and methods of index correction ( e.g. , emission infill correction , velocity dispersion correction , etc . ) . @xcite",
    "have tested the roubustness of their observed age-@xmath101 slope against these two factors when they studied the stellar population in coma . in their test , a stricter emission - line cut and different methods of velocity dispersion correction were used . only slight change on the age-@xmath101 slope was found in their tests .",
    "they concluded that their data robustly support the downsizing scenario .",
    "the etgs also have very strong dependence of @xmath4-abundance on @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath4 elements are mainly from the type ii supernovae , and the iron - peak elements come mainly from the type ia supernovae . the stronger alpha - enhancement in the more massive elliptical galaxies may imply that their star formation timescale is shorter than less massive elliptical galaxies , before the delayed type ia supernovae enrich the star - forming regions with iron - peak elements .",
    "the observed @xmath4-abundance@xmath148 relation fits well with the prediction from the hierarchical models with feedback @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a photometric study of a671 with the beijing - arizona - taiwan - connecticut ( batc ) multicolor system and the sdss data .",
    "the main conclusions can be summarized as follow :    \\(i ) about 7000 sources are detected in a batc field of @xmath25 centered at a671 , and their seds in 15 intermediate bands are obtained . the 985 galaxies brighter @xmath156 are selected by cross - identifying our batc source catalog with the released catalog of sdss galaxies .",

    "<S> in this paper we present a photometric and spectroscopic study of the nearby galaxy cluster abell 0671 ( a671 ) with 15 intermediate - band filters in the beijing - arizona - taiwan - connecticut ( batc ) system and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data . after a cross - identification between the photometric data obtained from the batc and sdss , </S>",
    "<S> a list of 985 galaxies down to @xmath0 mag in a view field of 58@xmath1@xmath258@xmath1 is achieved , including 103 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the photometric redshift technique is applied to the galaxy sample for further membership determination . </S>",
    "<S> after the color - magnitude relation is taken into account , 97 galaxies brighter than @xmath3 mag are selected as new member galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> based on the enlarged sample of cluster galaxies , spatial distribution , dynamics of a671 are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the substructures of a671 are well shown by the sample of bright members , but it appears less significant based on the enlarged sample , which is mainly due to larger uncertainties in the light - of - sight velocities of the newly - selected faint members . </S>",
    "<S> the sdss r - band luminosity function of a671 is flat at faint magnitudes , with the faint end slope parameter @xmath4=-1.12 . </S>",
    "<S> the sdss spectra allow us to investigate the star formation history of bright cluster galaxies , and the galaxies in the core region are found to be older than those in the outskirts . </S>",
    "<S> no environmental effect is found for metallicities of the early - type galaxies ( etgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> both mean stellar ages and metallicities in bright member galaxies are found to be correlated strongly with their stellar masses assembled , and such correlations are dependent upon morphology . </S>",
    "<S> the possitive correlation between age and stellar mass supports the downsizing scenario . by comparing etg absorption - line indices with the state - of - art stellar population models , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the relevant parameters of simple stellar population ( such as age , [ fe / h ] , [ mg / fe ] , [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] , and [ ca / fe ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the etgs at cluster center tend to have smaller indices , indicating that central etgs are likely to be older . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of total metallicity indicator , [ mgfe]@xmath5 , does not show any environmental effects . </S>",
    "<S> the relations between the simple stellar population parameters and velocity dispersion in a671 are in good agreement with previous studies .    </S>",
