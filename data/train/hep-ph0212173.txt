    "a new facility is being built at the gsi @xcite that will measure charm near threshold with @xmath16 gev .    because the charm quark mass is a few times @xmath17 , it is generally treated as a heavy quark in perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "however , its relative lightness results in a rather strong dependence of the total cross section on mass and scale , with up to a factor of 100 between the lowest and highest next - to - leading order ( nlo ) results @xcite .",
    "there is also a rather broad spread in the measured charm production cross section data at fixed target energies .",
    "much of this uncertainty arises from low statistics in the early experiments , assumptions of how much of the total charm yield results in final - state @xmath18 mesons , and how the measured data are extrapolated to full phase space .",
    "the more recent data have improved considerably with new detection techniques and higher statistics .",
    "improvements in the calculation of the charm cross section are difficult at all energies , but are perhaps possible when the @xmath0 pair is produced close to threshold , as we now describe .",

    "either may be used in the scaling functions within the accuracy of our approximations . however",

    "we use the former choice here but point out that the latter choice increases the cross sections in both kinematics and leads to less negative ( or even positive ) values for the pim results .",

    "the nll resummed cross section , calculated using the partonic total cross sections , is in rather good agreement with our kinematics - averaged nnlo - nnll results .      given the large corrections at nnlo - nnll , one can question if the calculated cross section will stabilize such that all data can be described with one value of the charm mass even if nnnlo and higher order corrections were calculated . since the nnlo - nnll 1pi results allow the data to be described relatively well with @xmath144 gev instead of @xmath97 gev and @xmath99 , it is quite possible that further corrections could lead to agreement with the data for still higher values of @xmath98 .",

    "if , instead , we use the cteq5 m densities to calculate the nlo @xmath147 factors in @xmath1 interactions , @xmath162 at all energies and the values are all larger than for the grv 98 ho densities .",
    "the larger @xmath147 factors for cteq5 m are due to the larger @xmath21 with the cteq5 m @xmath130 .",

    "both the reduced size of the @xmath147 factors as well as their near energy independence can be attributed to the greater importance of @xmath71 annihilation in charm production , particularly at low @xmath132 . the @xmath75 contribution to the @xmath71 channel",
    "is considerably smaller relative to @xmath167 than in the @xmath30 channel , reducing the @xmath147 factor .",
    "since the @xmath1 cross sections are dominated by the @xmath30 channel , their @xmath147 factor is always large .",
    "all these nlo @xmath147 factors are rather large for @xmath1 interactions , typically a factor of two or more",
    ". we can define the next order @xmath147 factor , @xmath168 , and see if it is reduced relative to @xmath150 .",

    "we can not distinguish between calculations with parton densities at different orders for these @xmath147 factors , as we did for @xmath150 , because there are no full nnlo parton densities available .",
    "now both numerator and denominator are calculated with all nlo parton densities and the two - loop evaluation of @xmath21 . by calculating @xmath172 for the nlo parton densities",
    ", we can identify improvements in the fixed - order results relative to @xmath151 .",
    "figure  [ kfacgrv ] also shows @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 in the dashed , dot - dashed and triple dot - dashed curves respectively . the 1pi @xmath147 factor , @xmath169 , is not strongly dependent on @xmath92 , @xmath98 or @xmath132 .",
    "it decreases slowly from @xmath109 at low @xmath132 to @xmath173 at higher @xmath132 .",

    "however , @xmath174 has the strongest @xmath92 , @xmath98 and @xmath132 dependence of all the @xmath147 factors even though it is the smallest .",
    "the fact that it is smaller is less indicative of the ultimate convergence of the expansion than of the fact that the nnlo - nnll pim contribution to the cross section is large and negative .",
    "this is demonstrated by the change of @xmath170 from positive to negative for @xmath175 gev when @xmath128 gev .",
    "as the charm mass increases , the slope of @xmath170 with @xmath132 decreases and the @xmath147 factor remains positive .",
    "the average @xmath147 factor , @xmath176 , is less than both @xmath151 and @xmath152 everywhere .",
    "it remains positive and is not strongly dependent on @xmath98 , @xmath92 or @xmath132 , remaining @xmath177 at low @xmath132 and decreasing to @xmath178 at higher @xmath132 .",
    "similar trends are observed for the cteq5 m densities but now the @xmath172 factors are all larger and more dependent on @xmath92 and @xmath98 , even @xmath169 .",
    "now also @xmath179 for @xmath128 gev and 1.5 gev at large @xmath132 . for @xmath2 interactions , on the other hand , all the @xmath147 factors are again smaller and @xmath169 is almost independent of energy , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kfacpip ] .",
    "we could form another @xmath147 factor , @xmath180 , to test the convergence of the hadronic cross section .",
    "the result is not complete because the nnlo - nnll cross section is only approximate and the nnlo parton densities are unavailable . by multiplying the @xmath147 factors shown in fig .",
    "[ kfacgrv ] , we see that @xmath181 is @xmath182 at low @xmath132 and @xmath183 at larger @xmath132 .",
    "note that @xmath184 is smaller and @xmath185 at high @xmath132 .",
    "it is difficult to tell from these results if further , higher order , @xmath147 factors such as @xmath186 will be consistently smaller than 2 near threshold or not .",
    "the convergence of the hadronic cross section at low scales is thus left in doubt although we note that subleading terms may have some effect on the convergence properties of the cross section @xcite . since @xmath187 for @xmath99 , one can expect that the next - order correction might be still smaller but this is not certain . in any case",
    ", it is not a guarantee that even larger masses may be needed to obtain the by - eye agreement at nlo with further higher - order corrections .",
    "we now turn to a comparison of the scale dependence at lo , nlo and nnlo - nnll , shown in fig .",
    "[ mudep ] for the ratio @xmath188 as a function of @xmath132 in @xmath1 interactions .",

    "the grv 98 ho scale dependence is largest for the lo ratio .",
    "the nnlo - nnll 1pi ratio is somewhat larger than the nlo ratio for @xmath97 gev but the two are almost identical for @xmath108 gev .",
    "thus for 1pi , the scale dependence is not reduced relative to nlo but it is not really increased either . the nnlo - nnll pim ratio is smaller than the other ratios but it is a stronger function of energy , again becoming negative for @xmath97 gev as @xmath132 increases .",
    "this ratio has the largest mass dependence .",
    "the ratio for the average of the nnlo - nnll 1pi and pim cross sections remains below the nlo ratio for all energies shown .",
    "the cteq5 m scale dependence is considerably larger . in this case , when @xmath104 gev , the nnlo - nnll 1pi scale dependence is larger even than the lo , dropping below it only when @xmath108 gev . the overall increase in the scale dependence relative to grv 98 ho is again related to the larger @xmath21 for low scales with the cteq densities which also increases the nnlo - nnll contribution to the total cross section .    the scale dependence of @xmath2 production , shown in fig .",
    "[ mudeppip ] , is considerably reduced and , except for the nnlo - nnll pim ratio , nearly independent of energy . this reduction in the scale dependence can again be attributed to the relatively larger @xmath71 contribution to the total cross section .",
    "we have studied the behavior of nnlo - nnll calculations for charm production near threshold in @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions in both 1pi and pim kinematics .",
    "we find that there are large differences in the results for different kinematics .",
    "thus , the uncertainties in the cross sections remain large even at nnlo - nnll .",
    "there are additional uncertainties , mentioned earlier , due to the functional form of the scaling functions and to subleading logarithms which have some effect on the values and convergence of the 1pi and pim cross sections .",
    "we note that the average of the 1pi and pim results has some nice properties such as better convergence and less scale dependence . for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 interactions , either choice of scale , and all values of @xmath132 ( except when @xmath189 gev at high @xmath132 ) ,",
    "the average of the nnlo - nnll 1pi and pim results lies above the nlo cross section .",
    "thus , the charm mass need not be too low to agree with the data .",
