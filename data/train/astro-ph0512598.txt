    "the nucleus @xmath0 is a long lived ( @xmath4 2 myr ) radioactive isotope that should be present in an appreciable amount in our galaxy .",
    "historically , @xmath0 has been considered as a key isotope to understand whether or not massive stars are the main contributors to the diffuse @xmath5 present in the galaxy , another long lived radioactive isotope ( @xmath4 1 myr ) traced by the detected 1.809 mev @xmath3-ray emission line at a level of @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , already in the early 80 s @xcite pointed out that snii are the only candidate sources for @xmath5 to produce also @xmath0 and hence that the detection of this isotope in the milky way could constitute a strong argument in favour of snii as the main contributors to the galactic @xmath5 .",
    "the first detection of @xmath0 in the galaxy was obtained with rhessi and reported by @xcite .",
    "the line flux detected implies a @xmath2 @xmath3-ray line flux ratio of @xmath9 ( for each @xmath0 line ) .",
    "more recently @xcite reported the first detection of @xmath0 decay lines at 1.173 mev and 1.333 mev in spectra taken by the spi spectrometer on board integral during its first year , yielding a @xmath3-ray line flux of @xmath10 .",
    "the same analysis applied to the 1.809 mev line of @xmath5 yielded a @xmath2 @xmath3-ray line flux ratio of @xmath11 . from a theoretical side , many groups have performed calculations of nucleosynthesis in massive stars , estimating the amounts of either @xmath5 or both @xmath5 and @xmath0 ejected in the interstellar medium .",
    "however , no set of models covers an extended grid of stellar masses . indeed , several research groups interested in the presupernova evolution and explosion of massive stars provided yields of both @xmath5 and @xmath0 for stars up to a mass of @xmath12 @xcite - among these works only @xcite included mass loss in the computations . on the other hand , groups mainly interested in the evolution of massive stars including mass loss computed the evolution up to the end of central he burning and",
    "hence provide only the hydrostatic yield of @xmath5 @xcite .    in this paper we will discuss to some extent the production of @xmath0 in massive stars in the range between 11 and 120 @xmath1 , both in the hydrostatic and explosive stages .",
    "we will also provide theoretical predictions for the @xmath2 @xmath3-ray line flux ratio of such a generation of massive stars and we will compare them with the observations .",
    "the yields of @xmath5 and @xmath0 discussed in this paper are based on a new set of presupernova models and explosions of solar metallicity stars , with mass loss , in the mass range between 11 and 120 @xmath1 , covering therefore the full range of masses that are expected to give rise to type ii / ib / ic supernovae as well as those contributing to the wolf - rayet populations .",
    "all these models , computed by means of the latest version of the franec code , will be presented and discussed in a forthcoming paper ( limongi & chieffi in preparation ) .     as a function of the initial mass ( filled stars ) : the hydrostatic shell he burning contribution ( filled circles ) ; the hydrostatic shell c burning contribution ( filled triangles ) ; the explosive contribution ( filled squares ) . ]",
    "the isotope @xmath0 is an unstable nucleus ( its terrestrial decay time is @xmath13 ) that lies slightly out of the stability valley , its closest stable neighbor being @xmath14 . at temperatures below @xmath15 @xmath0",
    "is mainly produced by neutron capture on the unstable nucleus @xmath16 and destroyed by the @xmath17 reaction ( that always overcomes the beta decay ) . since @xmath16 is unstable , the @xmath0 production rate depends on the competition between the @xmath18 reaction and the @xmath19 decay . at temperatures above @xmath15",
    ", @xmath0 is totally destroyed mainly by @xmath20 photodisintegrations and @xmath21 reactions .",
    "hence , two requirements must be fulfilled in order to obtain a substantial production of @xmath0 : 1 ) the neutron density must be high enough ( i.e. the temperature must be high enough ) to allow the @xmath18 reaction to overcome the @xmath19 decay ; 2 ) the temperature must be not too high to lead to the complete destruction of @xmath0 via @xmath20 and @xmath21 reactions .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of the neutron density necessary to cross the @xmath16 bottleneck may be derived by equating the ( n,@xmath3 ) and @xmath22 decay rates .",
    "a comparison between such a neutron density and the central neutron density obtained during the evolution shows that no substantial production of @xmath0 is obtained in any central burning of a massive star .",
    "indeed , for temperatures below @xmath15 the actual neutron density is always below the one required to produce a substantial amount of @xmath0 . on the contrary ,",
    "the larger burning temperatures at which the shell burnings occur allow a much higher production of @xmath0 .",
    "in particular , in stars in the mass interval 40 - 120 @xmath1 , shell he burning occurs at temperatures as high as @xmath23 .",
    "this implies a neutron density of @xmath24 , the neutrons being produced mainly by the @xmath25 reaction , and hence a large amount of @xmath0 .",
    "in analogy with shell he burning , also shell c burning occurs at temperatures high enough ( @xmath26 for stars in the mass interval 20 - 120 @xmath1 ) that a high neutron density is obtained ( @xmath27 ) and hence a large amount of @xmath0 is synthesized . also in this case the main neutron source is the @xmath25 reaction , the alpha particles being provided by the @xmath28 reaction",
    ". it must be noted , at this point , that the presence of a convective shell plays a crucial role for the synthesis of @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , it has the double responsibility of bringing new fuel ( @xmath29 particles and @xmath30 ) in the region where the active burning occurs and simultaneously of bringing the freshly made @xmath0 outward in mass , i.e. at lower temperatures where the neutron density becomes negligible and the @xmath0 half life increases substantially .",
    "shell ne burning occurs at temperatures high enough , but still below the critical value for the total destruction of @xmath0 , to allow a large neutron density . however , the lack of an extended and stable convective shell lasting up to the moment of the explosion prevents the build up of a significant amount of @xmath0 . in shell o and si burnings the temperature is so high ( above @xmath15 ) that no appreciable amount of @xmath0 is produced .",
    "the hydrostatic production of @xmath0 as a function of the stellar mass is shown in figure 1 .",
    "a comparison between the contribution due to the shell he burning and shell c burning shows that in stars below @xmath31 the hydrostatic production of @xmath0 is dominated by the contribution of the shell c burning while above this limit the @xmath0 is mainly due to the shell he burning .",
    "the local minimum corresponding to the @xmath32 is the consequence of the lack of an efficient c convective shell lasting up to the presupernova stage in this model .",
    "the isotope @xmath0 is eventually produced during the explosion in the regions heated up to a temperature of @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , for the typical explosive burning timescales ( @xmath34 s ) , below this critical temperature the neutron density is too low to allow a substantial production of @xmath0 while above this limit @xmath0 is totally destroyed by photodisintegration reactions . since in most cases such a temperature is reached either at the base or within the c convective shell and since the matter behind the shock wave can be assumed radiation dominated @xcite , the amount of @xmath0 produced during the explosion will depend on the local abundances of @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath30 left by the last c convective shell episode and on the final mr relation at the moment of the core collapse @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the total yield of @xmath0 as a function of the stellar mass together with the explosive and hydrostatic contributions .",
    "there is a global direct scaling with the initial mass and a quite monotonic behavior : the two exceptions are the @xmath38 and the @xmath32 models .",
    "the @xmath38 model constitutes a striking exception because a large amount of @xmath0 is synthesized by the explosion in this case .",
    "the reason is that the peak temperature of @xmath39 k occurs beyond the outer border of the c convective shell where the abundances of @xmath36 and @xmath30 , in particular , are much higher than in the c convective shell .",
    "the minimum corresponding to the @xmath32 model has been already discussed ( see above ) .",
    "below @xmath31 the total yield is dominated by the contribution of the c convective shell while above this mass it is the he convective shell to play the major role .",
    "the explosive burning almost always plays a minor role .",
    "@xmath3-ray line flux ratio integrated over a single power low imf as a function of the slope of the imf for three different upper mass limits ; @xmath40 ( filled triangles ) ; @xmath41 ( filled squares ) ; @xmath42 ( filled circles ) .",
    "the solid lines refer to the standard models , while the dashed lines to models in which the contribution to the @xmath0 of the he convective shell of the more massive stars is removed . ]",
    "to compare properly with the observations ( see introduction ) , the yields of both @xmath5 and @xmath0 must be integrated over a stellar initial mass function ( imf ) @xmath43 .",
    "we assume here that the imf is described by a single power low , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath2 @xmath3-ray line flux ratio as a function of the slope @xmath45 of the imf , obtained for three different values of the imf upper mass limit , i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( solid lines ) .",
    "the horizontal shaded area refers to the @xmath2 @xmath3-ray line flux ratio reported by integral / spi @xcite while the hatched areas correspond to the region where the ratio between type ib / c and type ii supernovae is compatible with the observed value of @xmath48 , as reported by @xcite .",
    "figure 2 clearly shows that our theoretical predictions always overestimate the observed @xmath2 @xmath3-ray line flux ratio for any choice of the slope of the imf and the imf upper mass limit .",
    "this is due to the copious @xmath0 production in stars more massive than @xmath12 .",
    "indeed , the fit is much more improved if such a contribution is artificially removed in these stars ( dashed lines in figure 2 ) .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the implications of these result will be addressed soon in a forthcoming paper .",
