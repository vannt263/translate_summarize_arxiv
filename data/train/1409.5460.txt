    "the field of spintronics seeks to investigate and organized phenomena concerning spin angular momentum .",
    "of much recent interest in this field are spin - transfer torque ( stt )  @xcite , spin pumping ,  @xcite , current -induced magnetization dynamics ( spin waves ) , @xcite the ( inverse ) spin hall effect ,  @xcite and the more recent spin caloritronics .",
    "@xcite as a scientific enterprise , this rich intersection of spintronic physics hosts a vast and non - trivial dynamical landscape with many yet - unexplored avenues of research",
    ". meanwhile , the degree to which spintronics can be applied to problems in computational information architecture is already quite promising , and it is likely that the full extent of these technologies is presently unrealized .",
    "spintronics as a technological program ultimately means to provide a high - information - density , energy - efficient computational architecture .",
    "stt and spin pumping provide a means to exchange spin into and out of a system , essentially constituting a i/ o layer for applications . therefore",
    ", their study is central in connecting any spin - based computing scheme to a realistic electronic device .    over the past two decades , scientists expended considerable effort was in learning to manipulate and detect ferromagnetic order via stt  @xcite and spin pumping .",
    "@xcite this capacity to manipulate the magnetic order in ferromagnets  and , therefore , to initiate spin waves in the magnetic tecture  is the foundation of _ magnonics_. in the magnonics program , spin waves provide a complete replacement for itinerant electrons ; information is no longer carried in conjunction with a flowing charge , but as a quasiparticle excitation of the background texture .",
    "the result is that no joule heating is produced , making magnonics an attractive form of low - power computing .",
    "recently , kajiwara _ et al .",
    "_  have demonstrated the transmission of magnonics information , written and read via stt and spin pumping , in yttrium iron garnet ( yig ) .",
    "@xcite in their experiment , however , the critical current required to excite a spin wave was lower than expected .",
    "this descrepency was later resolved by xiao _",
    "et al . _ , who theorized that the experimental apparatus had excited surface modes , rather than the expected bulk waves , and furthermore showed that these surface spin waves are associated with the considerably lower excitation threshold found in the experimental data .",
    "@xcite    here , we are interested not in yig , but in antiferromagnetic ( afm ) magnonics . because afms lack a net magnetization , their magnetic order is difficult to detect and control with magnetic fields .",
    "applications of afms are consequently scarce , limited mostly to their use for exchange bias pinning of ferromagnetcs .",
    "though spintronics research has historically focused on ferromagnetism , many theoretical works have considered how spin currents flowing through afms could interact with that magnetic order .",
    "@xcite these studies of spintronics in afm metals , however , address the electron as the spin carrier .",
    "the ideal system for magnonics would be in an insulator , where magnons alone are the dominant spin carrier .",
    "but until recently , there existed a colloquial understanding that afm insulators could not support magnons with a nonzero spin , for any spin carried on one sublattice would be canceled by the other .    recently , cheng _ et al . _",
    "shattered this illusion by showing that , in easy - axis afms , spin waves necessarily carry a spin angular momentum by adopting either a left- or right - handed chiral mode.@xcite furthermore , they derived the magnetization dynamics due to stt in afm insulators , and showed that both stt and spin pumping exist in afms and operate in a similar way to the ferromagnetic case . despite these theoretical successes , some barriers still exist to realizing afm magnonics in experiment .",
    "the most obvious dilemma is that , due to the strong exchange coupling in afms , the resonance frequency of bulk spin wave modes can be significantly higher than in ferromagnets  typically , it lies in the thz regime . generating a thz signal is presently impossible by electronic means , as it would typically require a current which would melt the device before producing any meaningful effect .    in this article",
    ", we address the possibility of lowering the effective excitation threshold in afm magnonics by considering the surface spin wave modes of afms .",
    "our prediction relies on the fact that surface atoms in certain antiferromagnets can have an effective exchange energy significantly lower than the bulk value .",
    "one would then expect that the resonant frequency of spin waves localized to these exchange - reduced atomics will have lower excitation thresholds and be easier to excite .",
    "we compute the surface spin wave spectra of antiferromagnetic insulators with both magnetically compensated and uncompensated surfaces , and show that these surface modes are , as expected , lower in energy .",
    "we then include a contribution from stt due to a polarized spin current injected at the surface .",
    "we find that this stt is sufficient to excite the surface spin waves in low - surface - exchange systems , which demonstrates a step toward making afm magnonics more realizable in experiment .",
    "we also show that the sign of the stt determines the handedness of the chiral afm spin wave as predicted by cheng _",
    "et al_.@xcite    this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : macrospin - model ] , we present a pedagogical model demonstrating not only that afm spin waves can be excited by spin current , but also that the chirality of the spin wave depends on the spin current polarization .",
    "the distinction between source chiralities of spin waves due to their oppositely carried angular momentum could markedly improve the fidelity of devices utilizing the magnetization domain for information processing . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lattice - calculation ] , we make the system more realistic by extending the dynamical equations from two sites to a full cubic lattice . here",
    "we present new results on afm spin wave spectra for a semi - infinite system with an interface .",
    "based on previous work , @xcite we expect that surface effects , by their role in modifying the magnons activation threshold , will play an important part in the experimental realization of spin wave modes .",
    "in particular , we explore variations of the exchange coupling on the surfaces with both compensated and uncompensated net magnetizations . in sec .  [",
    "sec : discussion ] , we offer concluding remarks and an application for experimental methods .",
    "via an on - site effective field . spin - torque is injected via a polarized spin current @xmath0 , and energy is dissipated via the gilbert damping @xmath1 .",
    "not pictured are the external field and uniaxial anisotropy , both along @xmath2.[fig : setup - for - macrospin ] ]    to provide a conceptual account of the mechanism underlying stt - generated spin waves in af materials , we first present a minimal model which includes the important physical terms ithout the complications of a spatially extended lattice .",
    "this so - called `` macrospin model '' has been considered by many in the past , and we include it here not as new work but as a pedagogical tool to illustrate the mechanism by which stt determines afm spin wave handedness .",
