    "* ) and an electromagnetic flare is produced as the debris falls back onto the black hole .",

    "individual tde are also interesting since the sudden increase of accretion rate after the disruption , from zero to super - eddington in a few months or even hours , is much more rapid than the timescale of normal accretion onto super - massive black holes . a number of ( candidate ) tde",
    "have been identified in x - ray @xcite for a review see @xcite , uv @xcite and optical surveys @xcite . based on the optical luminosity of observed tde",
    "one can predict that near - future synoptic surveys , such as lsst @xcite , should detect thousands of such events per year @xcite .",
    "follow - up observations of candidate tde at radio frequencies is important to identify these events , as was realized when the first x - ray candidates were detected @xcite .",
    "however , blind radio variability surveys also have the potential to _ discover _ tde .",
    "the rapid increase of sky coverage and sensitivity of variability surveys at both high and low frequencies promises an exciting future for this field .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a model for the radio emission from tde , based on the interaction of the jet with the interstellar medium ( ism ) ; @xcite compared their predictions to upper limits of existing radio surveys for transients .",
    "the present work is an extension of the approach outlined in @xcite , where we use the well - established jet - disk symbiosis model to calculate a time - dependent jet model for tdes .",
    "we will only consider the emission from the compact core of the jet ; interactions with the surrounding medium may enhance the jet luminosity in some cases , but here we aim to obtain a conservative model and we therefore consider solely the internal jet emission .    in section [ sec : jetlum ]",
    "we present our time - dependent jet model . in section [ sec : lc ] we discus the light curves produced by our model and compare them to radio observations of candidate tde such as grb 110328a .",
    "we predict the snapshot rate of jets from tde in section [ sec : snap ] and compare this rate to the sensitivity of current and future radio transient surveys .",
    "there is already quite a range of time - dependent models for radio jets in super - massive black holes in the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they typically only address relatively small changes or focus on a subclass of agn .",
    "a major question remains how jets evolve , as a function of time when accretion suddenly sets in and increases by many orders of magnitude .",
    "there is increasing consensus that accretion discs and jets are intrinsically coupled and are best understood as a symbiotic system .",
    "evidence that jets are ubiquitous to accretion comes from the ` fundamental plane of black holes ' , which provides a universal scaling law for the non - thermal emission of black holes over all mass scales @xcite .",
    "we thus proceed under the hypothesis that all accreting massive objects , including tdes , launch a jet , but , as discussed later , take potential radio - loud / radio - quiet switches at high accretion rates into account .    in this section , we will first generalize the jet - disk symbiosis model of ( * ? ? ? * fb95 , hereafter ) to a time - dependent accretion rate and we then apply this model to tde .",
    "the essence of jet - disk symbiosis is power unification : @xmath0 , the jet power ( @xmath1 ) is some fraction ( @xmath2 ) of the disk luminosity ( @xmath3 ) , which is a linear function of the accretion rate ( @xmath4 ) . if we assume equipartition between the energy in relativistic particles and the magnetic field , the synchrotron emissivity follows from the accretion rate : @xmath5 , with @xmath6 the distance to the origin of the jet ( fb95 , eq .",
    "we obtain the synchrotron luminosity of the jet ( @xmath7 ) by integrating the emissivity over the jet volume , a cylindrical - symmetric cone , @xmath8 ( fb95 , eqs .",
    "52 & 56 ) . here",
    "@xmath9 is the doppler factor of the jet and @xmath10 is the observed frequency .",
    "the lower limit of integration , @xmath11 , is the distance where the jet becomes optically thin to synchrotron self - absorption .",
    "the normalization ( @xmath12 ) is the conversion factor between jet power and jet luminosity , which can be estimated using equipartition arguments or obtained by observations .",
    "the great success of jet - disk symbiosis is that the observed properties of all accreting black holes with radio - loud jets can be fit with @xmath13 and a single value of the normalization ( @xmath12 ) of eq .",
    "[ eq : jd ] @xcite . in his work , we will fix @xmath12 using the empirical normalization found by @xcite for efficient accretion , @xmath14 , and we will use a jet lorentz factor @xmath15 @xcite throughout .    the `` classic '' jet model ( eq . [ eq : jd ] ) is derived for a constant accretion rate ; to use this model for a time - dependent accretion rate , @xmath16 , we have to consider three things : ( i ) the non - zero time delay of photons emitted at different locations in jet , ( ii ) @xmath17 will set the time scale of the emission , and ( iii ) the emissivity becomes a function of time .",
    "the latter of these changes is trivial to apply because at the base of the jet , the relation between the synchrotron emissivity and accretion rate is given by the standard jet - disk model and all one has to do is to propagate @xmath18 forward in time using @xmath19 .",
    "to account for ( ii ) we use @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the synchrotron emission coefficient , to find @xmath22^{2/3 }   \\left[\\gamma_j \\sin(i)\\right]^{-1/3 } z_{\\rm ssa } = 1\\ , { \\rm pc}\\ ; f\\frac{\\mbox{ghz}}{\\nu/\\delta } \\left(\\frac{q_j(t)}{0.2}\\frac{l_d(t)}{10^{45}\\ , { \\rm erg}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{3 } } \\left(\\frac{\\beta_j}{\\sin(\\frac{i}{30^{\\circ } } ) } \\frac{5}{\\gamma_j}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\ ] ] ( fb95 , eq .",

    ", we only have to provide one more ingredient to produce radio light curves for these events : the fraction of accretion power that is fed into the jet .",
    "jets from active super - massive black holes can be radio - loud or radio - quiet @xcite , which appears to be at odds with jet - disk symbiosis .",
    "however , detailed observations have shown that nearly all radio - quiet agn do show some radio emission which can be interpreted as originating from the core of a relativistic jet @xcite . indeed",
    "radio - quiet jets can also be accommodated by eq .",
    "[ eq : jd ] by reducing @xmath12 or @xmath2 with a factor @xmath55 with respect to radio - loud systems .",
    "if we assume that the physics behind launching the jet and producing the synchrotron emission is no different for tde and `` normal '' active black holes , we are left to answer the following question : _ is a tde jet radio - loud or radio - quiet ? _ observations of accreting stellar mass black holes ( i.e. , x - ray binaries ) can help to answer this question since they are variable on timescales down to minutes @xcite and they can serve as examples for agn @xcite .    when x - ray binaries experience a burst of accretion , they follow a predefined track in the hardness - intensity diagram @xcite corresponding to distinct accretion states with associated jet properties @xcite . in the quiescent mode ( the hard - state ) and during the onset of the burst ,",
    "jets in x - ray binaries are radio - loud , while in the high - accretion mode ( the soft - state ) they are radio - quiet .",
    "the sudden enhancement of the accretion rate during a tde , may move it through the different modes of accretion in two ways : directly into the radio - quiet soft - state , or into the soft - state via the radio - loud burst - state .",
    "alternatively , the jet from a tde may behave like a radio - loud quasar at all times .",
    "we therefore consider three different scenarios for the fraction of accretion energy that is fed into the jet : @xmath56 where each scenario reverts to the preceding one if the condition on @xmath57 or @xmath4 is not true ( e.g. , @xmath58 if @xmath59 in all three scenarios ) . in scenario @xmath60 the jet becomes radio - loud only when the accretion drops below @xmath61 @xcite , while in scenario @xmath62 the systems makes a full loop trough all accretion modes , starting with a radio - loud burst during the onset of the accretion .",
    "we consider @xmath63 most optimistic , @xmath60 most pessimistic , and @xmath62 the most likely scenario .",
    "the two orders of magnitude difference in @xmath2 between scenarios @xmath63 and @xmath60 can also be taken to reflect our uncertainty on the coupling between jet power and accretion during the super - eddington phase of the disruption .",
    "with @xmath2 and @xmath4 at hand , we can now calculate , @xmath38 , the radius where the jet will slow down significantly , which is the upper limit of the integral over jet volume ( eq . [ eq : jd_time ] ) . for @xmath64 and scenario @xmath63 ( eq .

[ eq : z_ssa ] ) this implies a significant suppression of the luminosity for observers looking at @xmath69 because @xmath70 .",
    "however , this suppression is less relevant at lower @xmath71 or @xmath2 , since @xmath72 while @xmath73 .",
    "clearly , the density distribution within a few parsec from the black hole varies between galaxies : each tde jet will face a different deceleration radius . in elliptical galaxies , @xmath38 is likely to be larger by at least a factor @xmath74 with respect to the value adopted in this work , due to the low gas density in these galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". on the other hand , @xmath38 can decrease if the jet runs into a high - density clump of matter , which will enhance the luminosity , as seen in an exemplary way in the radio - intermediate quasar @xcite .",
    "for galaxies where @xmath75 , the external emission as modelled by @xcite dominates over emission from the core of the jet at all relevant frequencies .",
    "discriminating between core and external emission for individual tde jets may be possible using the time delay between the radio emission and the time of disruption .",

    "the duration of the radio flare is maximal if viewed along the critical angle , @xmath79 ; within this angle , the timescale is shorter because most photons arrive nearly simultaneously at the detector , while at larger viewing angles , the frequency in the rest - frame of the jet ( @xmath80 ) increases , making the jet visible at earlier times .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : radio_obs ] we show follow - up radio observations that have been obtained for some candidate tde .",
