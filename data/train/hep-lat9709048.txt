    "the perturbative symanzik approach to improvement is in this work represented by three actions ; a tree - level version with a plaquette    ( 20,22.5)(5,11.25 ) ( 7.5,7.5)(0,1)9.375 ( 7.5,7.5)(1,0)15 ( 7.5,22.5)(1,0)9.375 ( 7.5,7.5)(0,1)15 ( 22.5,7.5)(-1,0)9.375 ( 22.5,22.5)(-1,0)15 ( 22.5,22.5)(0,-1)9.375 ( 22.5,22.5)(0,-1)15    and a @xmath2 rectangle    ( 35,22.5)(5,11.25 ) ( 7.5,7.5)(0,1)9.375 ( 7.5,7.5)(0,1)15 ( 7.5,22.5)(1,0)9.375 ( 7.5,22.5)(1,0)24.375 ( 7.5,22.5)(1,0)30 ( 37.50,22.5)(0,-1)9.375 ( 37.50,22.5)(0,-1)15 ( 37.50,7.5)(-1,0)9.375 ( 37.50,7.5)(-1,0)24.375 ( 37.50,7.5)(-1,0)30    @xcite ( abbreviation : s ) and two one - loop actions , one with a @xmath3 parallelogram ( x , y , z ,- x ,- y ,- z )    ( 32,22.5)(5,11.25 ) ( 7.5,7.5)(0,1)9.375 ( 7.5,7.5)(0,1)15 ( 7.5,22.5)(2,1)7.5 ( 7.5,22.5)(2,1)11.25 ( 18.9,28.2)(1,0)9.375 ( 18.9,28.2)(1,0)15 ( 33.9,28.2)(0,-1)9.375 ( 33.9,28.2)(0,-1)15 ( 33.9,13.2)(-2,-1)7.5 ( 33.9,13.2)(-2,-1)11.25 ( 22.5,7.5)(-1,0)9.375 ( 22.5,7.5)(-1,0)15    @xcite ( s1 ) and the other with both parallelogram and a @xmath4 large square    ( 35,35)(5,11.25 ) ( 7.5,7.5)(0,1)9.375 ( 7.5,7.5)(0,1)24.375 ( 7.5,7.5)(0,1)30 ( 7.5,37.5)(1,0)9.375 ( 7.5,37.5)(1,0)24.375 ( 7.5,37.5)(1,0)30 ( 37.50,37.5)(0,-1)9.375 ( 37.50,37.5)(0,-1)24.375 ( 37.50,37.5)(0,-1)30 ( 37.50,7.5)(-1,0)9.375 ( 37.50,7.5)(-1,0)24.375 ( 37.50,7.5)(-1,0)30    @xcite ( s1s ) as additional operators . of these also the tadpole improved ( ti ) versions (",
    "sti , s1ti , s1sti ) are considered .",

    "@xcite .",
    "the non - perturbative approach to improvement is represented by a truncated fixed point action ( fp ) which includes first to fourth powers of the plaquette and the parallelogram @xcite .",
    "the measurements consist of static two - quark potentials for @xmath5 on - axis , @xmath6 off - axis and the binding energies of four quarks at the corners of a regular tetrahedron , the cube surrounding it having sides of length @xmath7 . here",
    "binding energies mean @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the energy of four quarks and @xmath10 the energy of the lowest - lying two - body pairing  see @xcite .    in order to separate the ground state a variational basis of fuzzing levels 13 and 2 is used . an update step consisted of four overrelaxations and one heatbath sweep , except for the fp case for which the latter was replaced by ten metropolis sweeps .",
    "table [ tbeta ] shows the @xmath11 values and corresponding scales used for the comparison .",
    "scales were set by fitting plateau two - body potentials at @xmath12 with the continuum parameterization @xmath13 and using sommer s equation @xmath14 with @xmath15 , corresponding to @xmath16 fm .",
    "these scales agree with the determination using @xmath17 mev .",
    "the plateau was taken to be reached when the difference of potentials at @xmath18 and @xmath19 was smaller than the bootstrap error on this difference .    .",
    "[ tbeta ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the lattice self - energies of the quarks given by the on - axis fit vary up to 40 % between different actions . in lowest - order perturbation theory",
    "this is due to the different lattice one - gluon exchange operators .",
    "for two - body potentials rotational invariance is improved significantly , while statistical errors are not  with the same amount of computer time used the wilson action has the smallest statistical errors .",
    "the improvement in scaling seems to be small .",
    "for symanzik improved actions ti works ; statistical errors , rotational variance and scaling violations are reduced .",
    "our only representative of truncated fp actions performs well at @xmath0 fm , but has problems at the coarser @xmath20 .    when using an improved action further improvement can be achieved with improved operators , which can also be essential for correct physics e.g. in lattice sum rules .",
    "technical difficulties associated with improved operators include the separation of field components , for which planar actions ( in this work s , sti ) are easier .",
    "other means of improvement include anisotropic lattices , lookup tables for loop collection , cache optimization and tuning the fuzzing parameters . some of the latter three can be quite easily implemented with possibly a significant time - saving effect .",
