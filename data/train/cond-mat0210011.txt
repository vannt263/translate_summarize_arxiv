    "the anomalous properties of the state with current in one - dimensional integrable system has attracted considerable interests . especially , the heat conduction in one - dimensional systems is a long -standing problem .",
    "it has been expected that the existence of conserved quantities implies anomalous conductivity of the heat current @xcite .",
    "a large number of numerical investigations have been done @xcite it is natural to consider the state with current as the non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) , i.e. , the state which is asymptotically realized from the inhomogeneous initial state @xcite,@xcite . in other words , the ness is the state at the convergent point .",
    "there reported many works on the ness itself .",
    "however , the relaxation process to the ness is not much investigated . after a large but finite time",
    ", what kind of profile does the observable quantity show ? in the previous paper @xcite , stating from the inhomogeneous initial state ( the temperatures of the left and the right are different ) , we obtained the homogeneous ness for the transverse @xmath1-model . investigating the profiles in the intermediate time , we would obtain the diffusion of the temperature profile .",
    "furthermore , in the integrable system , the existence of the conserved quantities may have a significant influence on the relaxation process . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the profile at the large intermediate time using the transverse @xmath1-model .",
    "the chain is initially divided to the left and the right , and kept at different temperatures .",
    "the problem of intermediate profile with inhomogeneous initial condition in the @xmath1-model was first studied by antal.et.al . in @xcite .",
    "they considered the magnetization profile in zero temperature with the reversed external field , the situation which makes the calculation simple .",
    "it was shown that the magnetization profile shows the scaling property , @xmath2 .",
    "they calculated the explicit form of the scaling function @xmath3 , which has the flat part around the origin .",
    "we investigate this problem with the aid of the @xmath0-algebraic argument . modifying the argument of ho and araki @xcite",
    ", we develop a method which is applicable to the present situation .",
    "the @xmath0-algebraic argument makes the calculation much simpler , and enables us to consider the more general situation , including the finite temperature case .",
    "we obtain the scaling limit @xmath2 .",
    "for the situation of antal.et.al .",
    "@xcite , we reproduce the same result .",
    "we further consider the finite temperature case . in the finite temperature case",
    ", we obtain a remarkable dependence of the magnetization profile on the strength of the external field and the temperature .",
    "when the external field is large , or the difference of the temperature is small , the profile varies monotonically .",
    "on the other hand , when the external field is small and the difference of the temperature is large , the profile is not monotone and has two extremum points .",
    "this feature is absent at the zero - temperature .",
    "that is , this phenomenon is due to purely thermal effect .",
    "this can be explained by the velocity distribution . in section",

    "owing to the bilinear form of the hamiltonian , the dynamics of the many body system can be written by the dynamics of the single particle .",
