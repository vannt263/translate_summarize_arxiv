    "<S> we investigate the uniform spin susceptibility @xmath0 in the bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer)-bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) crossover regime of an ultracold fermi gas . including pairing fluctuations within the framework of an extended @xmath1-matrix approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we show that @xmath0 exhibits non - monotonic temperature dependence in the normal state . in particular , @xmath0 is suppressed near the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath2 due to strong pairing fluctuations . to characterize this anomalous behavior </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the spin - gap temperature @xmath3 as the temperature at which @xmath0 takes a maximum value . </S>",
    "<S> determining @xmath3 in the whole bcs - bec crossover region , we identify the spin - gap regime in the phase diagram of a fermi gas in terms of the temperature and the strength of a pairing interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we also clarify how the spin - gap phenomenon is related to the pseudogap phenomenon appearing in the single - particle density of states . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that an ultracold fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover region is a very useful system to examine the pseudogap phenomenon and the spin - gap phenomenon in a unified manner . </S>"
