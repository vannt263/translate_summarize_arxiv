    "this is the fourth in a series of papers ( efstathiou 2004 , 2005 , 2006 ; henceforth e04 , e05 , e06 respectively ) outlining a methodology for analysing power spectra for a -type cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) experiment .",
    "the first of these papers discussed fast hybrid methods for estimating temperature power spectra .",
    "the hybrid method combines a maximum likelihood estimator at low multipoles , computed from low resolution maps , with a pseudo-@xmath2 ( pcl ) estimator at high multipoles computed using fast spherical transforms applied to high resolution maps ( see hivon 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "a near optimal hybrid estimator can be constructed if the noise properties of the input maps obey certain properties , _",
    "e.g. _ if the noise is accurately white at high multipoles and if correlated noise can be accounted for in the pixel - pixel noise covariance matrices for the low resolution maps used in the maximum likelihood estimate .",
    "if this is the case , accurate analytic expressions for the pcl covariance matrices can be derived for realistic sky cuts .",
    "the hybrid estimator concept was generalised to polarization in e06 and analytic formulae for pcl polarization power spectra for noise - free and noisy data were derived .",
    "( see also the related paper by challinor and chon , 2005 ) .",
    "there is a large literature on power spectrum estimation methods and we will not attempt to give a comprehensive bibliography here . a fairly complete set of references to previous work can be found in the papers of hybrid power spectrum estimators ( e04 , e06 ) .",
    "cmb temperature map reconstruction errors for a -type were considered in e05 , on the assumption that maps would be constructed using simple ` destriping ' techniques ( see _ e.g. _ burigana 1997 ; delabrouille 1998 ; maino 1999 ; revenu 2000 ; keihnen 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "destriping algorithms are particularly suited to a -type scanning strategy in which the sky is scanned many times on rings . in e05 , it was shown that for a ring torus scanning geometry ( and provided the instrument noise satisfies certain reasonable properties ) it is possible to compute accurately the effects of residual striping errors on the temperature power spectrum .",
    "for realistic detector noise , the resulting error power spectrum is indeed accurately white at high multipoles , but at low multipoles the striping errors introduce a bias in the temperature power spectrum that has a distinctive ` sawtooth ' type pattern with an envelope that varies approximately as @xmath3 . for realistic -type scanning geometries",
    ", the ring torus model provides a good ( but not exact ) description of the error power spectrum determined from simulations of the time - ordered data ( tod ) .",
    "e05 also argued that for a slowly precessing scanning strategy , and detector noise properties such as envisaged for , a simple destriping map making algorithm will be close to optimal .",
    "the destriping errors are dominated by ` irreducable ' white noise errors in the ring overlaps and so there is little to be gained by implementing computationally demanding least squares map making methods ( _ e.g. _ wright 1996 ; tegmark 1997a , b ; borrill 2001 ; natoli 2001 ; dor 2001 ) .",
    "this conjecture has been verified by ashdown ( 2006 , hereafter a06 ) , who compared a number of map making codes applied to simulated data ( specifically , simulations of four 217 ghz detectors ) .",
    "the temperature power spectrum residuals from the different codes are almost identical , except for small differences at low multipoles . a simple destriping code ( for example , the springtide code described by a06 ) fitting one offset ( or ` baseline ' ) per ring pointing produces a map that is very close to optimal . depending on the value of the detector noise ` knee frequency ' , the accuracy of a destriping algorithm can be improved further by increasing the number of baselines and by applying more sophisticated destriping algorithms that include information on the correlations between baseline offsets ( keihnen , kurki - suonio and poutanen , 2005 ) . however , the simulations of a06 show that for the knee frequencies expected for the improvements in the maps are minor as the number of baselines is increased above one per scanning ring .    in this paper we extend the analysis of e05 to polarization .",
    "as we will show in section 3 , for a ring torus geometry it is possible to construct an analytic model for temperature and polarization destriping errors .",
    "formulae are presented in section 3 for the contribution of residual destriping errors to the temperature and polarization power spectra and also for the pixel - pixel noise covariances in maps of arbitrary resolution .",
    "section 4 describes numerical simulations of a -like focal plane geometry and slow precessing scanning strategy .",
    "specifically , we use the geometry of the four polarization sensitive bolometer pairs at @xmath0 ghz ( see spp05 )",
    ". however , to make large numbers ( thousands ) of simulations feasible , we have assumed @xmath4 fwhm beams instead of the @xmath5 beams of , and that the scans consist of @xmath6 ring pointings instead of the @xmath7 ring pointings of .",
    "the detector white noise assumed for these simulations was adjusted so that the noise properties of the maps match those expected from at equivalent spatial resolution .",
    "these simulations therefore give a good impression of the actual noise properties of @xmath0ghz maps at low multipoles . with these simulations it is possible to compute the pixel - pixel noise covariance matrix for degraded resolution maps and to isolate the component arising from destriping errors .",
    "these pixel noise covariance matrices can be compared with the ring torus approximation derived in section 3 .",
    "we then develop an extremely fast and accurate monte - carlo method of estimating the pixel - pixel noise covariance matrices based on the statistical properties of destriping baseline offsets .",
    "this method offers a reliable way of quantifying the pixel - pixel covariance matrices for temperature and polarization maps of arbitrary resolution and for realistic noise and scanning geometries .",
    "these pixel - pixel noise covariance estimates can then be used as inputs to maximum likelihood methods of power - spectrum estimation ( e04 , e06 , slosar and seljak 2004 ) or map - based gibbs sampling methods ( see _ e.g. _ larson 2006 ) .",
    "we follow the notation of keihnen ( 2005 , hereafter kkp05 ) and write the tod stream as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the pixelised cmb temperature map , @xmath10 is a pointing matrix , and @xmath11 is the detector noise .",
    "( polarized maps will be dealt with below , but to keep the equations simple we will assume for the moment that we are solving for a temperature map ) .",
    "we assume that the noise can be decomposed into a correlated part consisting of a linear combination ( described by the matrix @xmath12 ) of a set of baseline offsets @xmath13 and a white noise component @xmath14 , @xmath15 with covariance matrix @xmath16 as shown in kkp05 , if the distributions of the offsets @xmath13 and white noise @xmath14 are assumed to be gaussian , the maximimum likelihood map and offsets are give by minimising the @xmath17 , @xmath18 giving the solutions @xmath19 where @xmath20 the fisher matrix of the baseline offsets is given by the second derivative of ( [ tod4 ] ) with respect to the baselines @xmath13 , @xmath21 and we will assume that the _ posterior _ distribution of the offsets @xmath13 is given by a gaussian distribution of the form @xmath22 the first term in ( [ tod6 ] ) depends only on the scanning geometry and white noise component of the detector noise .",
    "the second term depends on the form of the detector noise spectrum at low frequencies . for -like noise properties ( detector knee frequencies of @xmath23mhz ) ,",
    "the first term is dominant and represents an _ irreducible _ contribution to the baseline offset covariance .",
    "in the rest of this paper we will assume that the irreducible term dominates and hence that the striping errors are independent of the exact form of the low frequency noise spectrum .",
    "in other words , we ignore @xmath24 and assume white noise errors in the tod throughout .",
    "this should be an excellent approximation for ( see figure 5 of e04 ) .",
    "it is straighforward to generalise to the results of this paper include correlations @xmath25 in the baseline offsets .",
    "methods for estimating @xmath25 from the tod are discussed in kkp05 .",
    "the generalisation of the above analysis to polarization sensitive detectors is straightforward .",
    "define @xmath26 to be the tod for detector @xmath27 with orientation @xmath28 with respect to a fixed spherical polar coordinate system . in terms of the stokes parameters",
    "@xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in this fixed coordinate system , the detector response is @xmath32 ( see figure 1 and section 3.1 for a precise definition of the angle @xmath33 ) . if the noise covariance @xmath34 is diagonal , @xmath35 and the pointing matrix @xmath36 is consists of ones and zeros ( denoting when a map pixel falls onto an element of the tod ) the first term in equation ( [ tod4 ] ) can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the map pixel , @xmath39 denotes the tod elements of detector @xmath27 that lie within map pixel @xmath38 and @xmath40 is the expected tod signal for detector @xmath27 from the best fitting maps , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , derived by minimising the @xmath17 of equation ( [ tod4 ] ) .",
    "if correlated errors are small , the second derivative of ( [ tod9 ] ) gives the inverse covariance matrix for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , at pixel @xmath38 , @xmath44 where the sums extend over all detector tod elements @xmath45 .",
    "the condition number of the matrix @xmath46 is often used to determine whether the stokes parameters are well constrained in map pixel @xmath38 ( see e.g. a06 ) .",
    "evidently , equation ( [ tod10 ] ) applies only if the tod noise is strictly white and in general the noise will be correlated .",
    "section 4 describes a fast monte - carlo method for estimating these correlated errors .",
    "2.8 truein    in this section , we analyse destriping errors in the idealised case of ring torus scanning geometry with two pairs of bolometers in the ` standard ' @xmath30 and @xmath31 configurations shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "each detector pair is assumed to point to the same spot on the sky at a boresight angle of @xmath47 to the spin axis .",
    "the sky is covered by a ring torus composed of a set of discrete @xmath48 rings of width @xmath49 as the spin axis is repointed along a great circle .",
    "the detector orientations of the @xmath30- and @xmath31-configurations with respect to a fixed polarization basis on the sky can be specified by the the angles @xmath50    since the detectors are assumed to point to the same spot on the sky , @xmath51 for detectors in the standard configuration of figure [ figure1 ] , though below we will write down general results for arbitrary angles .",
    "the response of each of the detectors is denoted @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , as shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "if the noise in each tod is white , with identical variance @xmath56 , unbiased @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 maps can be constructed by minimising ( [ tod9 ] ) : @xmath57 where @xmath58    the problem that we wish to solve in this section is as follows : assume that destriping is performed by fitting a single baseline offset for each scanning ring for each detector and assume further that the errors in the baseline offsets are uncorrelated and charaterised by dispersions @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the @xmath30- and @xmath31-configurations respectively .",
    "we wish to calculate the biases in the temperature and polarization power spectra associated with these errors .",
    "this provides a good model for the effects of residual striping errors on cmb power spectra .",
    "as we will show in the rest of this section , this problem can be solved analytically for a ring torus geometry .",
    "2.6 truein    to compare with the analytic calculations , we have run a set of @xmath61 simulations constructing @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 maps , using equations ( [ m1a] [ m1c ] ) for a ring torus geometry with random ring offsets . @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 maps for one such realisation are shown in figure [ figure2 ] . in this set of simulations , we use @xmath62 rings of width @xmath63 composed of @xmath64 ring pixels .",
    "maps were constructed using an igloo pixelisation scheme ( e04 ) with pixels of size @xmath65 .",
    "we will refer to these maps as ` error maps ' .",
    "the assumptions underlying these simulations are , of course , highly idealized .",
    "as mentioned above , with these assumptions the error power spectra can be computed analytically .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise these simulations to realistic -like scanning strategies and to include correlations between ( an arbitrary number ) of baseline offsets .",
    "simulations of this sort are described in section 4 .",
    "as we will show , the scanning strategy ( see spp05 ) is so close to a ring torus that the model described in the next section provides quite a good description of the destriping errors expected for .",
    "the spherical harmonic transforms of the error maps can be written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 in these equations the index @xmath68 denotes the ring number , @xmath69 denotes the pixel number within the ring and @xmath70 is the solid angle of the ring pixel .",

    "it is useful to define the auxiliary functions @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 and the functions @xmath80 and @xmath81 are @xmath82 ( see , for example , kamionkowski , kosowsky and stebbins , 1997 , and references therein . )",

    "the transformation to the new coordinate system thus leads to a simple relationship between the @xmath94 and @xmath95 mode harmonic coefficients and the quantities recorded by each detector . evidently if the baseline offsets are uncorrelated , @xmath99 in the simulations described in the previous section we assumed @xmath100 , @xmath101 , with @xmath102 ( though the actual value is unimportant for this discussion ) .",

    "furthermore , the dominant terms in both power spectra are the @xmath76 terms which are similar to the @xmath113 terms at high multipoles .",
    "thus , we expect the error power spectra in the @xmath94 and @xmath95 modes to have about twice the amplitude of the temperature error power spectrum .",
    "the ring variances @xmath59 and @xmath60 are determined largely by the white noise in the tod and the scanning geometry ( equation [ tod6 ] ) , and so differences in the detector noise levels will directly effect the destriping error contributions to the power spectra . finally , if @xmath114 , equation ( [ rt12d ] ) show that destriping errors on the te ( denoted x in this paper ) power spectrum will be identically zero , even if the destriping errors are large .",

    "evidently , the simulations and theory are in perfect agreement .",
    "the ` sawtooth ' pattern , with a @xmath3 , envelope is a characteristic feature of map making in a total power experiment with a near ring torus scanning geometry . this pattern can be seen in , for example , the analysis of simulations described by a06 .",
    "it is worth emphasing the point made in the introduction that destriping errors for a -like experiment can not be removed by applying an ` optimal ' least - squares map making code , since it is not possible to remove the ` irreducible ' striping errors fixed by the detector white noise and scanning .",
    "furthermore , if the detector @xmath120 knee frequencies are comparable to , or less than , the spin frequency , simple destriping with a _ small _ number of baselines coefficients will be sufficient to get close to the irreducible striping errors ( see _ e.g. _ e05 , kkp05 , a06 ) .",
    "the analysis presented in this section shows that for a -like experiment , the effects of residual striping errors in the @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 power spectra will be ` pinned ' to the detector white noise level ( since this largely fixes the variance of the baseline offsets ) and will always dominate over the white noise level at low multipoles .",
    "optimal power spectrum estimators based on maps require the pixel - pixel noise covariance matrices . in the hybrid power spectrum approach discussed in e04 and e06 ,",
    "pcl estimators are applied at high multipoles and quadratic maximum likelihood ( qml ) estimators ( _ e.g. _ tegmark 1997c ; tegmark and de oliveira - costa 2001 ) are applied on degraded resolution maps to determine the power spectra at low multipoles . in the examples discussed in e04 and e06 ,",
    "noise was either ignored for the qml estimates , or assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "the results of the previous section show that in a realistic -like experiment , destriping errors will dominate over white noise at low multipoles and hence must be quantified to obtain accurate estimates of the power spectra and their statistical distributions .",
    "the same is true for any map - based power spectrum estimator , including map - based gibbs sampling methods ( see _ e.g. _ larson 2006 ) .    for a -size map ,",
    "containing typically @xmath121 pixels it is not feasible either to compute or store a full pixel - pixel covariance matrix .",
    "however , since destriping errors are important only at low multipoles , all that is required for power spectrum estimation is an accurate model for the pixel - pixel covariance matrices in low resolution maps .",
    "in fact , for the ring torus geometery described in the previous section , it is possible to calculate these covariance matrices analytically .",
    "the power spectra computed in the previous section are , of course , invariant with respect to the orientation of the spherical coordinate system , whereas the stokes parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 and their associated pixel covariance matrices are not . in the ring torus",

    "the simulations should thus give a good indication of what we might expect from at low multipoles .",
    "the resolution of the simulation ( set by @xmath6 scanning rings , compared to the @xmath7 scanning rings for ) has been chosen so that it is possible to generate large numbers of simulations of the tods on a workstation rather than a supercomputer .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise the simulations described in this section to full resolution and to relax the assumptions of white noise in the tod and one baseline per detector ring .",
    "7.1 truein    7.1 truein    figure [ figure6 ] shows the power spectra for the realisation of figure [ figure5 ] but now including destriping and white noise as described above .",
    "the maps corresponding to these power spectra are shown in the right hand panels of figure [ figure7 ] .",
    "the white noise level for these simulations is so low that it can not be seen in the @xmath93 and @xmath168 power spectra .",
    "however , the @xmath94 and @xmath95 mode power spectra are dominated by white noise at @xmath169 .",
    "the @xmath94 mode power spectrum is signal dominated at @xmath170 and at these low multipoles the dominant source of noise comes from destriping errors .",
    "since the white noise for each detector is assumed to be the same , the noise contributions to the @xmath94 and @xmath95 power spectra are almost identical . comparing the right hand panels of figure [ figure7 ] with the input maps",
    ", one can see that the @xmath30 and @xmath31 maps are dominated by white noise , but some large - scale cmb features can be discerned in these noisy maps .",
    "figure [ figure8 ] shows the maps of figure [ figure7 ] smoothed with a gaussian of width @xmath132 and repixelised onto pixels of width @xmath171 .",
    "the large scale cmb features in the output @xmath30 and @xmath31 maps are now clearly visible and the dominant source of errors are stripes aligned ( almost ) along great circles in the sky .",
    "if works as expected ( _ i.e. _ no unexpected and ` uncorrectable ' sources of low frequency noise ) the polarization maps at this frequency should be signal dominated on large scales .",
    "5.3 truein    figure [ figure9 ] shows the error power spectra determined from @xmath172 simulations with parameters as described above ( plotted as the blue circles ) .",
    "the ( green ) dashed lines in the figure show the white noise level expected for each power spectrum .",
    "the ( red ) lines show the ring - torus model of equations ( [ rt12a ] ) - ( [ rt12c ] ) scaled to provide a good fit to the numerical results .",
    "( a boresight angle of @xmath173 , appropriate for the polarized @xmath0ghz detectors , has been used for these predictions . )",
    "the ring - torus model deviates slightly from the numerical results at @xmath174 , but provides a highly accurate match to the error power spectra at higher multipoles .",
    "it is therefore feasible to use the error model to fit and subtract the noise biases to the power spectrum estimates for the @xmath94 and @xmath95 modes at @xmath175 .",
    "it is also worth pointing out that the error power spectra will increase the variances of the power spectrum estimates approximately as @xmath176 and will introduce coupling between coefficient of different @xmath177 ( see below ) .",
    "8.0 truein    pixel - pixel covariance matrices averaged over @xmath172 degraded resolution maps , such as those plotted in figure [ figure4 ] , are shown in figure [ figure10 ] .",
    "the left hand panels show the full pixel - pixel covariance matrices , which include signal , destriping errors and white noise .",
    "the panels to the right show the contribution to the pixel noise arising from destriping errors alone .",
    "these can be compared to the equivalent figures for the ring torus geometry shown in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "apart from differences in the amplitudes arising from differences between the dispersion of the ring offsets , the additional structure seen in figure [ figure10 ] is caused by the slow precession in the scanning strategy .",
    "the left hand panel of figure [ figure11 ] shows the coviariance matrix for the ring offsets @xmath178 for one detector determined by averaging over @xmath172 simulations .",
    "the ring offset covariance matrices are dominantly diagonal , as assumed in the ring torus model of section 3 , but there are some low amplitude correlations particularly with the rings separated by @xmath179 in ecliptic longtitude .",
    "the panel to the right shows the covariance matrix given by the inverse of the fisher matrix computed from the @xmath180 of equation ( [ sim1 ] ) : @xmath181 which depends only on the scanning pattern and the tod variance @xmath182 .",
    "the theoretical covariance matrix ( [ sim3 ] ) provides an excellent match to the empirical covariance matrix derived from destriping .",
    "using @xmath183th of the number of rings for it is feasible , as shown in this section , to analyse noise power - spectra and estimate the pixel - pixel noise covariance matrices of low resolution maps by brute force simulations of the tod . at full resolution",
    "this will become computationally challenging , if not impossible .",
    "for example , suppose we wish to analyse low resolution maps consisting of @xmath115 pixels , one would probably require more than @xmath184 simulations of the tod at each frequency to accurately characterise the pixel noise covariance matrices .",
    "however , figure [ figure11 ] suggests that full simulations of the tod are not required .",
    "instead , we can decompose the noise into an ` uncorrelated ' component described by the @xmath185 matrices of equation ( [ tod10 ] ) and a correlated component quantifying the destriping errors given by the fisher matrix of ( [ sim3 ] ) .",
    "we will focus on modelling the destriping errors in the remainder of this section .",
    "3.0 truein    8.0 truein    given the fisher matrix ( [ sim3 ] ) it is straightforward , and very fast , to generate simulations of correlated baseline coefficients and to compute @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 maps and error power spectra .",
    "these maps can then be degraded to a lower resolution after smoothing by a gaussian ( [ beam1 ] ) or a more complex function ( for example , if one wants to minimise contamination from the galaxy ) .",
    "an example is shown in figure [ figure12 ] . in this figure ,",
    "the left hand panels are identical to the right hand panels of figure [ figure10 ] show the destriping contributions to the pixel covariances derived from full simulations of the tod .",
    "the panels to the right show the destriping covariances from ring simulations assuming that the ring coefficients are gaussian distributed with a covariance matrix @xmath186 .",
    "the results are essentially identical to those from the simulations of the tods .",
    "monte - carlo simulations of the baseline offsets is therefore provide an entirely feasible approach to analysing the complex striping noise for .",
    "the map comparisons in a06 show that for realistic ` @xmath120 ' detector noise it is possible to get close to the ` irreducible ' destriping errors using a small number of baseline offsets ( as mentioned in the introduction , one offset per ring comes close to the ` optimal ' map solution ) and so a manageable number of baseline offsets can be used in the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the example shown in figure [ figure6 ] shows that the @xmath94-mode power spectrum for the @xmath0ghz channel should be signal dominated at multipoles @xmath187 and at @xmath188 destriping errors will be the dominant source of noise .",
    "it is therefore important to model the destriping noise from .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath95-mode spectrum is unknown ( for a recent review see efstathiou and chongchitnan , 2006 ) and may well be lower than the detection threshold , corresponding to a tensor - scalar ratio @xmath189 ( spp05 ) an accurate analysis of destriping errors will therefore be essential for the analysis of primordial @xmath95-mode anistropies ( particularly for the possible detection of a ` reionisation bump ' at @xmath190 , which can not be observed in ground based experiments ) .    finally , we mention that if the cmb fluctuations are an isotropic gaussian random field , then we expect the harmonic coefficients to satistfy @xmath191 the simulations described above show that the destriping errors are well approximated by a gaussian random field and , of course , gaussianity is assumed in generating simulations from the covariance matrices of the ring offsets . however , the striping errors , although gaussian , are evidently anisotropic since they are highly correlated along the scan direction .",
    "failure to model the destriping errors could therefore have a significant effect on tests for non - gaussianity in the data .",
    "the striping errors will also introduce correlations in the harmonic coefficients .",
    "for example , for the temperature anisotropies , e05 used the ring torus model to show that the striping errors lead to correlations : @xmath192 violating the statistical isotropy of equation ( [ sim4 ] ) . the ring torus model of section 3 can be used to show that destriping errors introduce similar correlations in the polarization harmonic coefficients . in assessing non - gaussianity , using either map based statistics or statistics based on harmonic coefficients , it will be important to model the effects of destriping errors .",
    "this can be done at full resolution by generating large numbers of simulations using ring covariance matrices , rather than simulations of the tods .",
    "this paper has presented an analysis of destriping errors in temperature and polarization maps for a -like experiment , generalising the results of e05 to polarization . for a simple detector geometry and ring torus scanning pattern ,",
    "we have shown that it is possible to compute analytically the effects of striping errors on both the power spectra and pixel - pixel covariances .    in section 4",
    "we have compared the ring torus model against simulations adopting the focal plane geometry of the polarized @xmath0ghz detectors and a slowly precessing scan strategy .",
    "the ring torus model provides a very accurate description of the noise power spectra at @xmath175 .",
    "the white noise in the detector tods in the numerical simulations was chosen to match the expected noise levels of the detectors in @xmath166 pixels .",
    "thus at low multipoles , the simulations should give a good indication of the expected performance of .",
    "the simulations show that polarization maps should be signal dominated at large scales . the @xmath94-mode power spectrum should be signal dominated at @xmath170 and destriping errors will be the dominant source of noise in the @xmath94- and @xmath95-mode power spectra at @xmath188 .",
    "destriping errors will therefore need to be modelled accurately in the analysis of the polarization power spectra from .    as discussed in e06 ,",
    "since the noise is expected to be white at high multipoles , near - optimal estimates of the power spectra and their covariances can be obstained using a hybrid power spectrum estimator .",
    "provided one has a model for the pixel covariance matrices , the low multipoles can be determined by applying a maximum likelihood estimator to low resolution maps .",
    "section 4 shows that a model for the pixel covariances for maps of arbitrary resolution can be constructed accurately using fast simulations based on the statistical properties of the destriping baseline offsets , rather than simulations of the full tod .",
    "such fast simulations will be useful for other purposes , for example , in assessing the signficance of tests for non - gaussianity in the maps .",
