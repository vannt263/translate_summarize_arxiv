    "the idea that our four - dimensional world can be described as a timelike hypersurface ( brane ) embedded in or bounding a five - dimensional manifold continues to be in the focus of modern investigations .",
    "especially this concerns cosmological braneworld solutions which exhibit many interesting and unusual properties ( see refs .",
    " for recent reviews ) .",
    "theories with the simplest generic action involving scalar - curvature terms both in the bulk and on the brane allow for the possibilities of superacceleration of the universe expansion,@xcite cosmological loitering even in a spatially flat universe,@xcite and `` cosmic mimicry,''@xcite which is characterized by the property that the braneworld model at low redshifts is virtually indistinguishable from the lcdm ( @xmath0 + cold dark matter ) cosmology but has renormalized value of the cosmological density parameters .",
    "the possibility of explaining other dark - matter phenomena in such models is discussed in ref .  .",
    "a vast majority of papers on braneworld cosmology are dealing with the situation of the @xmath1 symmetry of reflection with respect to the brane , which is equivalent to the brane being the boundary of the bulk .",
    "the present letter is devoted to the investigation of solutions where such symmetry is not imposed .",
    "braneworld cosmologies without @xmath1 symmetry of reflection were a subject of investigation , for example , in refs .",
    ". in these papers , however , the curvature term in the action on the brane was absent .",
    "the braneworld model without @xmath1 symmetry was studied in ref .   in the presence of the curvature term on the brane and with equal bulk cosmological and gravitational constants on either side of the brane . in ref .",
    ", the @xmath1-asymmetric model was considered in the braneworld theory with curvature term on the brane and with different cosmological constants in the bulk but with equal bulk gravitational constants on either sides of the brane . in a recent paper,@xcite",
    "an asymmetric braneworld cosmology was under consideration in the model without the induced - curvature term on the brane but with different bulk cosmological and gravitational constants on either side of the brane .    in this letter",
    ", we would like to consider the most generic braneworld model in which the values of the bulk fundamental ( gravitational and cosmological ) constants are different on the two sides of the brane and , in addition to this , the signatures of the extra dimension on the two sides of the brane may be arbitrary ( and different ) .",
    "note that the @xmath1-symmetric braneworld cosmology with timelike extra dimension was previously considered in refs .  , .",
    "before considering the asymmetric case with a brane separating between two bulk spaces , we consider a generalization in which a brane is a multivolume junction , i.e. , a boundary of @xmath2 bulk spaces with natural junction conditions .",
    "the theory of such spaces was initiated in ref .  .",
    "in the next section , we derive a system of cosmological equations for this configuration without assuming any symmetry between the bulk spaces .",
    "in particular , the values of the fundamental constants , and even the signatures of the extra dimension , may be different on different sides of the brane .",
    "after that , we study in more detail the usual case of two bulk spaces .",

    "the quantity @xmath15 is the trace of the symmetric tensor of extrinsic curvature @xmath16 of @xmath3 in @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 if the signature of the corresponding bulk part @xmath5 is lorentzian , so that the extra dimension is spacelike , and @xmath18 if its signature is @xmath19 , so that the extra dimension is timelike .",
    "the symbol @xmath20 denotes the lagrangian density of the four - dimensional matter fields @xmath21 the dynamics of which is restricted to the brane @xmath3 so that they interact only with the induced metric @xmath14 .",

    "in particular , we use the one - to - one correspondence between tensors in @xmath3 and tensors in @xmath27 which are invariant under projection to the tangent space to @xmath3 , i.e. , tensors @xmath28 such that @xmath29    variation of action ( [ action ] ) gives the equation of motion in the five - dimensional bulk parts @xmath5 : @xmath30 and on the brane @xmath3 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the einstein s tensors of the corresponding spaces , @xmath34 is formed from the tensor of extrinsic curvature , and @xmath35 denotes the four - dimensional stress  energy tensor of matter on the brane .",

    "our aim is to derive the resulting cosmological equation on the brane .",
    "one could solve this problem by considering embedding of the brane in the bulk spaces under consideration and calculating the corresponding extrinsic curvatures .",

    "if nonzero , they reflect the existence of black holes in the corresponding bulk spaces .",

    "this system of equations is to be solved for the metric and matter fields and for the symmetric tensor field @xmath62 on the brane .",
