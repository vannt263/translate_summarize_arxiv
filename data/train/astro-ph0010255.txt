    "whereas line absorption has been well studied and used for diagnostics and abundance analysis ( spitzer 1978 ) , resonant absorption does not appear to have been similarly considered .",
    "this is probably due to the general complexity of resonances that require rather elaborate atomic physics calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "resonances are ubiquitous , and may considerably affect the effective cross sections . in this _",
    "letter _ the theoretical treatment of resonant absorption is generalized using the quantity the differential oscillator strength that describes both bound - bound and bound - free absorption on either side of the ionization threshold .",
    "the method is applied to k - shell x - ray absorption in lithium - like oxygen .    the o  vi uv absorption in the @xmath5 transition at @xmath3 1031.91 and 1037.61 @xmath4 is widely observed in sources such as quasars and agn ( mathur _ et al._1994 , tripp _",
    "et al._2000 ) , and _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic observer _ ( fuse ) sources ( e.g. savage _ et al._2000 ) .",
    "et al._(1998 ) have predicted an ` x - ray forest ' of o  vii and o  viii absorption lines from the low - z hot intergalactic medium as a probe of baryonic matter .",
    "recently , x - ray absorption and emission line spectra have been reported from the cxo from h- and he - like ions such as o  viii and o  vii ( kaspi _ et al._2000 , kaastra _",
    "et al._2000 ) . in their work mathur _",
    "et al._(1994 ) reported on uv / x - ray absorption from the same element but in different ionization states , o  vi and o  vii , from the ` warm absorber ' region of agn .",
    "the possibility of the same ionic species ( o  vi ) as both the uv and x - ray absorber is therefore of further interest for ionization structure and abundance studies .",
    "it is shown in this _",
    "letter _ that resonant k - shell x - ray absorption by o  vi should lie among , but distinct from , the prominent emission lines of o  vii due to @xmath6 transitions .",
    "kll resonances are normally see as _ emission _ lines ( gabriel 1972 ) .",
    "di - electronic recombination of highly ionized ions , for example @xmath7 , leads to di - electronic satellite ( des ) lines that are useful diagnostics of high - temperature sources such as tokamaks and solar flares ( e.g. bely - dubau _ et al._1982 , beirsdorfer _ et al._1992 ) .",
    "the radiative decay rates of many des of fe  xxv approach or exceed autoionization rates ( e.g. pradhan and zhang 1997 ) . for lighter elements , such as oxygen ,",
    "radiative decays are much smaller and these resonances should manifest themselves primarily in absorption , as demonstrated in this work .",
    "the differential oscillator strength may be used to relate bound - bound and bound - free absorption as follows ( e.g. seaton 1983 , fano and rau 1986 , pradhan and saraph 1977 ) :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the line absorption oscillator strength , @xmath10 the photoionization cross section , i the ionization potential , z the ion charge , @xmath11 the effective quantum number at @xmath12 in rydbergs , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the fine structure constant and the bohr radius respectively .",
    "the quantity @xmath15 describes the strength of photoabsorption per unit energy , in the discrete bound - bound region as well as the continuum bound - free region , continuously across the ionization threshold .",
    "we may write ,    @xmath16    where @xmath17 represent the symmetries of the initial and final bound levels , and @xmath18 represents the continuum symmetry , governed by the usual dipole selection rules @xmath19 .",
    "the photoionization cross sections contain rydberg series of autoionizing resonances converging on the excited levels of the residual ( photoionized ) ion .",
    "the effective photoabsorption is generally enhanced in the vicinity of resonances .",
    "the @xmath15 reflects the same resonance structure as the @xmath10 in the bound - free continuum . combining the two forms of @xmath15 we therefore define , in the vicinity of a resonance , the integrated ` resonance absorption oscillator strength ' as :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 represent the initial bound and the final continuum symmetries .",
    "( 3 ) may be evaluated from the detailed @xmath10 for the symmetries concerned provided the resonance profile is sufficiently well delineated . in practice",
    "this is often difficult and elaborate methods need to be employed to obtain accurate positions and profiles ( the background and the peaks ) of resonances .",
    "relativistic effects need to be included to differentiate the fine structure components . using the coupled channel formulation based on the r - matrix and the relativistic breit - pauli r - matrix ( bprm ) method ( burke _ et al._1971 , berrington _",
    "et al._1995 ) a large number of photoionization cross sections have been calculated for all astrophysically abundant elements including resonance structures , particularly in the opacity project and the iron project works ( seaton _ et al._1994 , hummer _",
    "et al._1993 ) .",
    "the bprm formulation has been extended to theoretically self - consistent calculations of photoionization / recombination of atomic systems ( e.g. nahar _ et al._2000a , b , zhang _ et al._1999 ) , including a unified treatment of total non - resonant _ and _ resonant recombination ( radiative and di - electronic recombination ) .",
    "photoionization of , and electron recombination to , an atom is described in terms of the _ same _ eigenfunction expansion over coupled levels of the residual ( ` core ' or ` target ' ) ion .",
    "recently , bprm photoionization / recombination calculations have been carried out for li-/he-/h- like carbon and iron : c  iv / c  v / c  vi ( nahar _ et al._2000a ) and fe  xxiv / fe  xxv / fe  xxvi ( nahar _ et al._2000b ) for applications to x - ray photoionization and nlte modeling .",
    "we similarly consider the photoionization of the ground state of o  vi , @xmath22 into all n=1,2,3 fine structure levels of o  vii , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 in the target expansion .",
    "thus k - shell photoionization of o  vi @xmath27 , i.e. excitation - autoionization via the 1s @xmath28 2p transition resulting in 1s2s2p ( kll ) resonances , is considered .",
    "we consider the initial bound state of o  vi ( @xmath29 ) with symmetry j = 0.5 ( even parity ) , and final continua of o  vii with j = 0.5 and 1.5 ( odd parity ) .",
    "the kll resonances of interest here are : @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] .",
    "the autoionization and radiative decay rates , and cross sections with and without radiative decay of resonances , are calculated by analysing the poles in the complex dipole matrix elements using the method described in ( pradhan and zhang 1997 ) .",
    "the cross sections are resolved on a very fine mesh of up to @xmath32 ev .",
    "1a shows the photoionization cross section of o  vi from the l - shell ( 2s ) ionization threshold at o  vii @xmath33 , up to the k - shell ionization thresholds at 1s2s , 1s2p levels of o  vii . converging on to the k - shell edges are the kln @xmath34 complexes of resonances .",
    "we resolve the lowest resonance  doublet \" feature at @xmath35 rydbergs into 4 fine structure components of the 1s2s2p complex in detail in figs .",
    "the peak values in figs . 1b , c are up to 4 order of magnitude higher than the  edges \" in fig .",
    "1a , and indicative of the corresponding photoabsorption resonance ( par ) strengths .",

    "( the energy scale is also given in kev on top in fig .",
    "it is clearly important to resolve the resonances completely in order to evaluate the par strength @xmath0 according to eq .",
    "the probability of resonances decaying radiatively back to the bound state(s ) of o  vi , vs. the autoionization probability , is included using the radiation damping procedure described in pradhan and zhang ( 1997 ) .",
    "although not obvious on the log scale , the radiatively damped cross sections ( solid lines ) are up to 40% lower than undamped ones ( dashed lines ) at peak values .",
    "the resonances in fig .",
    "1c have no significant damping ( dashed and solid lines merge ) .",
    "the computed resonance positions @xmath36 , the autoionization and radiative decay rates @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the par strengths @xmath39 using radiatively damped and undamped cross sections ( the latter in parenthesis ) are given in table 1 .",
    "2 shows the computed differential oscillator strength @xmath15 for o  vi photoabsorption over a wide energy range , from the 2s-2p transition in uv , to the x - ray absorption in kll .",
    "the fine structure j = 0.5,1.5 has been summed over in oscillators strengths and photoionization cross sections .",
    "the bprm line oscillator strengths for the discrete ( @xmath40 ) transitions were also computed . in accordance with eq .",
    "( 2 ) , there is smooth continuation of @xmath15 across the 2s ionization threshold .",
    "( 2 ) provides a stringent check on both the line oscillator strengths and photoionization cross sections for each symmetry .",
    "the relative line and resonance strengths in o  vi are qualitatively apparent from fig .",
    "quantitatively , the computed par strengths are given table 1 .",
    "identification of the par ` satellites ' is in accordance with the standard des notation ( gabriel 1972 ) , where the kll resonances are labeled by letters a - v .",
    "the four dominant components of the 1s2s2p complex according to the calculated @xmath41 are the ones labeled ` t',`s',`r ' and ` u ' .",
    "two weaker components ` q ' and ` v ' are not resolved since their autoionization rates are about 2 order of magnitude smaller , and therefore their contribution to photoabsorption should be negligible ( see , for example , the corresponding @xmath37 for fe  xxv in bely - dubau _ et al._1982 , and pradhan and zhang 1997 ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath42 for resonances at @xmath43 21.87 @xmath4 are roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath37 , whereas for the resonances at @xmath43 22.05 @xmath4 @xmath37 and @xmath42 are comparable . that accounts for the significant radiation damping in the latter case ( fig .",
    "1b ) . the computed @xmath0 ( eq .",
    "3 ) for the par satellites are found to be comparable to typical line oscillator strengths @xmath44 for dipole transitions .",
    "the combined @xmath45 = 0.408 ( 0.5761 ) , and @xmath46 = 0.0606 ( 0.0608 ) . by comparison the o  vi f@xmath47(2s-2p ) for the uv fine structure doublet",
    "@xmath3 1031.91 and 1037.61 @xmath4 are 0.199 and 0.066 respectively , and the o  vii f(@xmath48 ) is 0.6944 ( wiese _ et al._1996 ) ; the latter is nearly equal to the sum of the ( undamped ) @xmath0 , as expected .",
    "significant x - ray absorption by o  vi at @xmath43 22.05 @xmath4 , and a weaker one at @xmath43 21.87 @xmath4 , is expected based on the theoretically computed resonance strengths .",
    "these wavelengths lie in the range spanned by the emission lines of o  vii due to electron impact excitation and recombination - cascades ( e.g. pradhan 1982 ) in transitions @xmath49 at @xmath3 22.101 , 21.804 , and 21.602 @xmath4 , usually labeled as ` f',`i ' and ` r ' for forbidden , intercombination and resonance transitions . although the o  vi absorption and o  vii emission features lie close together , they should be distinguishable with the cxo resolution ( e.g. canizares _ et al._2000 ) .",
    "an inspection of the x - ray spectra of the seyfert galaxy ngc 5548 , reproduced in fig . 3 from kaastra _",
    "et al._(2000 ) , appears to show absorption dips at @xmath3 22.05 and 21.87 @xmath4 ( dashed lines ) , both lying in between the ` i ' and ` f ' emission lines of o  vii .",
    "further , the @xmath43 22.05 dip is much stronger , as inferred by the @xmath0 given in table 1 .",
    "et al._(2000 ) do not comment on these features ; however , the combined o  vi absorption might be comparable to the _ net _ absorption in the resonance ` r ' line of o  vii ( albeit reduced by ` r ' emission ) . since the o  vii ` i ' and ` f ' lines at @xmath3 21.804 and 22.101 @xmath4 are forbidden , with einstein a - values 1.04 @xmath50 and 3.31 @xmath51 sec@xmath52 respectively ( wiese _ et al._1996 ) , they should not exhibit significant absorption , unlike the ` r ' line with a - value of 3.309 @xmath53 sec@xmath52 which does have an absorption component ( kaastra _ et al._2000 ) .",
    "it might be noticed from fig.3 that fits to all features are slightly shifted in @xmath43 due to velocity fields .",
    "in addition to the kll par s described herein , the closely spaced kln ( @xmath54 ) absorption may be discernible as a pseudo - continuum below the 1s2@xmath55 k - shell ionization edges ; for o  vi ( fig .",
    "1a ) these higher energy features might be between @xmath56 ( 0.64 - 0.71 kev ) .",
    "the kln are not fully resolved in fig .",
    "being much narrower than the kll , since @xmath57 , they are also more likely to be radiatively damped out , i.e. appear in emission via the dr process .",
    "the determination of column densities ( n ) and ionic abundances using observed equivalent widths @xmath58 , and the undamped par strengths @xmath0 ( table 1 ) , may be made with the standard curve - of - growth , i.e. log @xmath59 vs. log @xmath60 . given that the k - shell resonance absorption strengths are substantial",
    ", we should expect @xmath58(o  vi ) and n(o  vi ) from x - ray observations to be consistent with those obtained from o  vii ( kaspi _ et al._2000 , kaastra _",
    "et al._2000 ) .",
    "the non - resonant background has little effect on the results ; the predominant contribution is from energies close to the peak resonance values .",
    "the total @xmath15 in a given energy range quantifies the effective photoabsorption therefrom .",
    "the uncertainties in the photoionization calculations should be small .",
    "the bprm calculations for photoionization / recombination show excellent agreement in magnitude , shape , and positions of resonances compared with measured photo - recombination spectra from ion storage rings : c  iv , c  vi and o  vii ( zhang _ et al._1999 ) , ar  xiv ( zhang and pradhan 1997 ) , and fe  xxv ( pradhan and zhang 1997 ) .",
    "nonetheless , the _ ab initio _ bprm calculations are not quite of spectroscopic accuracy .",
    "for example , the computed ionization potential of o  vi is 10.1495 ryd , compared to the observed value of 10.1516 ryd  a difference of 0.02% , which may be the uncertainty in the computed resonance positions and wavelengths in table 1 .",
    "a few conclusions may be drawn from this study .",
    "\\1 . the strength of resonant photoabsorption may be computed and used for abundance analysis .",
    "highly accurate and detailed atomic photoionization cross sections are required to obtain the corresponding par strengths .",
    "2 . the x - ray spectra from cxo and xmm should display the par absorption features at @xmath61 and @xmath62 , lying in between the well known triplet emission features of he - like o  vii ( fig .",
    "o  vi and o  vii exist in very different plasma conditions , with peak temperatures for maximum abundance that may differ up to an order of magnitude depending on photoionization and/or coronal equilibrium ( kallman 1995 , arnaud and rothenflug 1985 ) .",
    "the o  vi absorption in both uv and x - ray provides an additional tool for ionization and abundance studies .",
    "an examination of x - ray spectra is suggested for both the o  vii emission and the o  vi absorption features .",
    "3 . radiative decay rates for autoionizing resonances may be obtained from the integrated @xmath15 since the einstein a - values are related to f - values ( wiese _ et al._1996 ) . as confirmation of accuracy of the method presented ,",
    "the computed @xmath0 in table 1 are nearly equal ( to two decimal figures ) to those obtained from the @xmath42 .",
    "however , the quantity @xmath15 is more general and represents photoabsorption in lines , resonances , and the non - resonant background at all energies . as such",
    ", it may be useful in complex cases with many overlapping resonances or lines .",
    "the par features in absorption should manifest themselves as di - electronic satellites ( des ) along an iso - electronic sequence as @xmath63 .",
    "contrariwise , unlike heavier elements like iron where the des are strong , for lighter elements like oxygen des emission is very weak ( possibly undetectible ) , and the par satellites could be important absorption line diagnostics .",
    "radiative transfer in resonances may be significant and should be considered in nlte and photoionization models . these and other points will be discussed in subsequent works .",
    "i would like to thank jordi miralda - escud for his suggestion regarding k - shell absorption that led to this work , and smita mathur for discussions .",
    "i am grateful to sultana nahar , hong lin zhang , and justin oelgoetz for collaboration on bprm photoionization calculations .",
