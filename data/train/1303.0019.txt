    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) provide the majority of photons capable of ionising intergalactic hydrogen over most of the age of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "some of the most commonly observed metal absorption lines in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , including @xmath8 and @xmath5 , have ionisation potentials at extreme uv ( euv ) energies where their main photo - ionising sources are agn .",
    "the mean free paths of ionising photons with energies greater than 1 rydberg are long enough to warrant the assumption that the ionising extra - galactic background ( egb ) is uniform in its spatial distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the main criterion for this assumption is that the mean free paths of photons are longer than the clustering length of photo - ionising sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this assumption obviously breaks down near sources of ionising radiation .",
    "particularly notable are the proximity zones of qsos , where the locally generated ionising radiation at euv energies may exceed the egb by orders of magnitude .",
    "the simple nature of hydrogen , having only two ionisation states , allows an elegant relationship where , in ionisation equilibrium , the neutral fraction scales in inverse linear proportion to the ionisation field strength if hydrogen is photo - ionised . a dramatic example of this",
    "are the proximity zones of high-@xmath15 quasars , where the @xmath16 forest absorption is significantly reduced by the enhanced agn radiation field as the qso is approached ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "qso pairs can probe the transverse proximity effect in which the background qso line of sight intersects the foreground qso proximity zone , where the radiation field is increased by orders of magnitude compared to the typical egb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "metal absorption also reflects the effects of increased ionisation in quasar proximity zones .",
    "proximate absorbers are often defined as being within 5000 @xmath17 of the qso velocity along the line of sight , and show some distinct signatures such as @xmath5 absorption with little or no @xmath2 absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite observe unique metal - line systems at @xmath18 in transverse proximate zones with an ionisation enhancement of 10 - 200@xmath19 , where @xmath5 is enhanced and @xmath8 is weakened .",
    "these signatures suggest that enhanced photo - ionisation affects metal lines , but in a different way than hydrogen .",
    "the multiple ionisation levels of heavy elements makes the response to increased ionisation more complex : metal ion fractions of order unity are possible at diffuse igm densities ( i.e.  much higher than @xmath2 fractions ) ; plus these fractions are not a monotonic function of density or temperature like that of @xmath2 , but instead peak at a preferred density or temperature for an intermediate ionisation state . in the case of an increased ionisation field ,",
    "the peak ionisation fraction for a metal species will move in linear proportion with the photo - ionisation rate to higher density if the species is photo - ionised and in equilibrium .",
    "another difference between hydrogen and metal species is the timescale that it takes each to achieve ionisation equilibrium when a proximate agn turns on and off .",
    "the ionisation timescales , relevant for the agn turn on , are longer for metal species with higher ionisation potentials , because fewer ionising photons are produced by the agn at these higher energies . however , the more important difference is the longer timescales metals take to reach ionisation equilibrium after the agn turns off .",
    "although most metal species have shorter recombination timescales , @xmath20 , than @xmath21 , the relevant timescale to achieve equilibrium is @xmath20 times the equilibrium ionisation fraction of the recombined species .",
    "for example , at typical warm ( @xmath13 k ) igm densities of the @xmath16 forest ( @xmath22 ) , @xmath23 yr , but the @xmath2 ionisation fraction , @xmath24 , is @xmath25 ; hence the equilibration timescale is only @xmath26 yr , because hydrogen only has to recombine to a very low neutral fraction to achieve equilibrium .",
    "metal - line species like @xmath8 and @xmath5 have recombination timescales that are @xmath27 yr at similar warm igm densities , but typical ionisation fractions much closer to unity .",
    "therefore , timescales to recombine to equilibrium are also @xmath27 yr  much longer than for @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , the existence of multiple ionisation states for metals means that there are a series of ions to recombine through , and hence multiple recombination timescales , further extending the total equilibration timescale .",
    "agn proximity zone fossils are defined as proximity zones in which the agn has turned off , but ionisation equilibrium has not yet been achieved .",
    "the fossil lifetime can last much longer than the agn - on phase , which is often calculated to be @xmath28 yr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in this work , we use the non - equilibrium code introduced in @xcite to follow the ionisation and temperature evolution of metal - enriched gas subjected to a variable ionisation field owing to an agn .",
    "we consider several situations where the fossil stage lasts as long as , and sometimes much longer than the agn phase .",
    "we predict the absorption line signatures of these fossil zones , and compare them to some recent observational results .",
    "we focus on diffuse gas with hydrogen numbers densities @xmath0 ( i.e.  @xmath29 ) , initially at the equilibrium temperature where cooling balances photo - heating , corresponding to warm igm temperatures , @xmath30 k.    the first case we will consider may be applicable to the case of the recently discovered strong @xmath6 absorber detected by @xcite in the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) spectrum of pg1206 + 459 at @xmath31 .",
    "this system is one of the most unique and most puzzling metal absorbers ever observed , containing both high ions like @xmath6 and low ions like @xmath10 .",
    "we explore non - equilibrium photo - ionised models with the agn on and in the fossil phase .",
    "we bolster our argument with evidence for a post - starburst , @xmath32 galaxy , possibly within 100 proper kpc , which shows signatures of being an agn .",
    "we use this as a fiducial example to consider variations in agn strength , lifetime , and duty cycles to show how metal lines can respond to variable ionisation conditions .",
    "we next consider agn proximity zone fossils at the height of qso activity at @xmath33 .",
    "the observations of metal - line absorption in transverse qso proximity zones along the line of sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide our initial motivation , and we extend the exploration to the case where the proximity zones turn into fossil zones after the foreground qsos turn off .",
    "we argue that unique absorption signatures should occur where @xmath2 re - equilibrates , but @xmath5 and @xmath8 are still out of equilibrium .",
    "we suggest that during the agn era a large fraction of metal - line systems could reside in proximity zone fossils .",
    "the last example we consider concerns massive , spiral galaxies at @xmath34 that may recently have harboured active agn , such as seyferts , but are currently in the less active or off phase .",
    "we demonstrate that increases of at least a dex are possible for circumgalactic ( cgm ) @xmath5 time - averaged over fossil phases for normal seyfert luminosities turning on 1 myr out of every 10 myr .",
    "our examples show just how sensitive metal lines can be to moderate agn , even if they are only on for a small fraction of time . as nearly all galaxies",
    "are thought to contain supermassive black holes in their centres , fossil proximity zones may be very important for the interpretation of qso absorption line data .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we introduce our non - equilibrium code and the methods used in this paper in  [ sec : method ] .",
    "we apply these methods to the agn proximity zones and proximity zone fossils for the examples mentioned above in  [ sec : application ] , and we summarise in  [ sec : summary ] . throughout",
    "we use proper distances unless noted otherwise .",
    "we use the non - equilibrium solver introduced in @xcite to follow the time - dependent ionisation states of 11 elements ( h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , and fe ) .",
    "the solver also calculates ion - by - ion cooling and photo - heating to follow the time - dependent non - equilibrium net cooling , defined as cooling minus photo - heating .",
    "the code is intended to be integrated in hydrodynamic codes , and includes a treatment to sub - cycle the integration of ionisation and cooling given the input courant timestep .    in this work ,",
    "we add the functionality to our method to allow the addition of photo - ionisation and photo - heating from a time variable source , which in this case has the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of an agn .",
    "the agn photo - ionisation rate ( s@xmath35 ) for an ionisation state @xmath36 of atomic species @xmath37 from a radiation source with specific intensity @xmath38 ( erg s@xmath35 @xmath39 hz@xmath35 ) is    @xmath40    and the agn photo - heating rate ( erg s@xmath35 ) is    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is frequency , @xmath43 is the ionisation frequency , @xmath44 is photo - ionisation cross - section , and @xmath45 is the planck constant . since we track 133 ionisation states of 11 elements , we integrate the above equations for the 122 ionisation states with electrons .    for the egb , we replace @xmath38 with the ionising background sed averaged over the whole sky , @xmath46 , in equations [ eqn : gamma ] and [ eqn : eps ] , where @xmath47 has units of erg s@xmath35 @xmath39 hz@xmath35 sr@xmath35 .",
    "as explained in @xcite , we calculate @xmath48 and @xmath49 at 50 different redshifts between @xmath50 using the ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hm01 ) egb and the same @xmath44 used in cloudy ver .  10.00 last described in @xcite .",
    "we use the hm01 egb as our fiducial background since this results in good agreement with the observed column density distribution of @xmath2 @xcite and metal line strengths and ratios @xcite .    the time dependent evolution of the particle number density , @xmath51 , for each ionisation state , @xmath52 , is given by    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the free electron density ( @xmath55 ) , @xmath56 is the total recombination rate coefficient ( radiative plus di - electric , @xmath57 s@xmath35 ) , and @xmath58 is the collisional ionisation rate coefficient ( @xmath57 s@xmath35 ) .",
    "the agn subscript indicates that the coefficients have been calculated using our agn template spectrum explained below .",
    "charge transfer and auger ionisation are also included in our calculations as explained in @xcite , but were omitted from equation [ eqn : ionstate ] for simplicity .",
    "charge transfer has negligible effects for the species we explore as this is more important for cases with significant @xmath2 neutral fractions , which are not the focus of this work .",
    "including auger ionisation increases the ionisation by a small amount for the lithium - like ions we explore , but the differences are of the order of 0.1 - 0.2 dex at most , and usually much less @xcite .",
    "the net cooling rate per unit volume ( @xmath59 , erg @xmath55 s@xmath35 ) , is the difference between cooling and photo - heating from the egb and the agn , @xmath60 the units of the cooling efficiency per ion , @xmath61 are erg @xmath62 s@xmath35 , where we divided the cooling rate per volume ( erg @xmath55 s@xmath35 ) for ion @xmath63 by @xmath64 to achieve density independence of collisional cooling , which allows us to tabulate these rates as a function of temperature only .",
    "figure [ fig : sed ] compares our agn template spectrum , @xmath38 to the hm01 egb , @xmath65 at the three different redshifts ( @xmath66 , 0.87 , and 0.27 ) nearest the three redshifts we consider in this paper ( @xmath33 , 0.9 , and 0.25 ) .",

    "the euv power law of the agn is @xmath72 between 1300   and 354 ev based on observations by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray portion of the spectrum is assumed to follow the cloudy agn template ( @xmath73 until 100 kev and then @xmath74 at higher energies ) .",
    "the four coloured vertical lines at the bottom indicate the ionisation potentials needed to reach the corresponding ion listed . ]    in cyan is the agn sed normalised to @xmath75 .",
    "since this is a point source , we can convert its flux into @xmath67 equivalent units by dividing by @xmath76 steradians to get @xmath77 , which has the same units as the egb .",
    "hence , @xmath78 is the intensity the egb would have if it were equally bright as the agn at the lyman limit .",
    "the spectrum has an euv power law with slope @xmath72 between 1300   and 354 ev based on observations by @xcite . at higher energies , the spectrum follows @xmath73 until 100 kev and then @xmath74 at higher energies , which follows the template cloudy agn spectrum .",
    "the most important slope for our consideration is the euv ( i.e.  10 - 354 ev ) slope , because these energies correspond to the ionisation potentials of the metal species we consider and which are marked in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "however , the x - ray portion of the spectrum is also important for two reasons : i ) photo - heating rates of species like @xmath79 and @xmath80 depend on the shape of the x - ray spectrum , and ii ) we convert to observed luminosities of agn based on their 0.5 - 2.0 kev luminosities ( @xmath81 ) .    to convert these units to agn luminosities ,",
    "the above flux ( @xmath82 ) corresponds to @xmath83 agn at 100 proper kpc , which is the luminosity one may expect from a local seyfert .",
    "the seyfert would outshine the @xmath34 hm01 egb at 912   by 45% at 100 kpc , but because of the harder agn spectrum at the @xmath5 photo - ionisation edge , 114 ev , the agn would outshine the hm01 spectrum by a factor of @xmath84 , assuming no absorption of the agn spectrum .",
    "in general , for our template agn spectrum the conversion from agn soft x - ray luminosity to equivalent egb intensity units is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the proper distance from the agn .",
    "we consider three situations spanning a wide range of redshifts , from @xmath33 to @xmath87 , that are applicable to recent observations . in all cases",
    "we assume the gas is being irradiated by the hm01 egb for the given redshift , and that it initially has the equilibrium temperature for which photo - heating balances cooling .",
    "this temperature corresponds to @xmath88 k assuming solar abundances for the densities we consider , @xmath89 .",
    "the main reasoning behind our parameter choices is that simulations indicate that a significant fraction of diffuse metals reside along a locus in density - temperature phase space where photo - heating balances cooling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and that many commonly observed metal - line species arise from gas at these densities and temperatures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although solar abundances are used , we will argue that our theoretical metal columns scale nearly linearly with metallicity .    in  [ sec :",
    "app1 ] we discuss our first application : an agn turning on at @xmath90 , which is motivated by observations of the very strong @xmath6 system observed by @xcite toward pg1206 + 459 , which appears to reside near a galaxy showing signs of agn activity .",
    "we pay particular attention to this example , because of the large number of metal - line species observed in this system and also because @xmath6 is one of the species most affected by agn ionisation .",
    "we vary several parameters including metallicity , density , agn strength , and agn lifetime . in  [ sec : app2 ] , we consider the effects on @xmath8 , @xmath91 , and @xmath5 columns at @xmath33 , both when a quasar is on and after it turns off .",
    "we estimate the fraction of the volume of the igm altered by fossil zones , and argue that a large fraction of observed metal lines may be affected .",
    "lastly , in  [ sec : seyfert ] , we explore short duty cycles of @xmath34 agn that significantly enhance @xmath5 columns , even while the agn is off",
    ". this case could be applicable to normal looking spirals that were recently seyferts , where residual non - equilibrium effects of agn ionisation enhance metal columns .    the general behaviour that we find can be summarised as follows .",
    "the enhanced photo - ionisation from the agn rapidly raises the ionisation states of metals , thus allowing high - ionisation species to exist at higher densities than they would in equilibrium with the normal egb . after the agn turns off",
    ", the long recombination times of metals , along with the multi - ionisation state nature of metals and their significant ionisation fractions ( i.e.  @xmath92 for multiple @xmath36 ) , mean that metal columns often only return to equilibrium on a timescale that is longer than the agn - on phase .",
    "thus , a whole new range of ionisation models that have not been considered are allowed .      in our fiducial example",
    ", we consider the effects of an enhanced ionisation in the proximity zone around an agn that is on for 20 myr at @xmath90 .",
    "this case is directly applicable to observations by cos at a redshift where a large array of both low- and high - ionisation species can be observed .",
    "this example is motivated by the extremely strong @xmath6 ( @xmath93 ) absorber observed by @xcite at @xmath12 along the pg1206 + 459 sight line with well - aligned lower ionisation species .",
    "a foreground galaxy , labelled @xmath94 by that work , found at the same redshift at an impact parameter of 68 kpc , shows signs of being a post - starburst galaxy with a @xmath95-band absolute magnitude of @xmath96 and even agn signatures from [ @xmath97 emission that likely can not be explained by star formation alone .",
    "figure [ fig : z09_tevol ] shows the time evolution of gas enriched to solar metallicity with @xmath98 , which corresponds to an overdensity of 77 at @xmath90 ( assuming @xmath99 and a hydrogen mass fraction of 0.75 ) .",
    "this choice represents a typical density of metal - enriched cgm gas .",
    "the gas is assumed to lie at its equilibrium temperature , @xmath100 k , when we mimic the instantaneous turn - on of the agn by adding our template agn spectrum to the hm01 egb at that redshift .",
    "we assume an agn flux of @xmath101 , which has the @xmath2 ionisation equivalence of a uniform egb with @xmath102 integrated over @xmath103 steradians ; this corresponds to @xmath104 the egb value and a total ionisation parameter log[@xmath105@xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the ratio of hydrogen ionising photon density over @xmath108 .",
    "using our template spectrum and integrating over the soft x - ray band ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) , we calculate that this is the flux at 100 kpc from a @xmath109 erg s@xmath35 agn , which appears to be a reasonable assumption given the observed impact parameter of 68 kpc for galaxy @xmath94 .    in the top panel",
    "we show the column densities of several observationally accessible ions by assuming an absorber length of 74 kpc , which is the predicted size of an @xmath2 absorber at this density and temperature according to equation 3 of @xcite .",
    "all column densities scale linearly with the assumed absorber size . as the agn turns on at @xmath110 , the @xmath2 column density and ionisation fraction drop nearly instantaneously by a factor of @xmath111 as @xmath112 is only 1100 yr for this field .",
    "the ionisation timescales for the metal species , shown in the middle panel of figure [ fig : z09_tevol ] during the agn - on phase ( thick dotted lines ) are longer , @xmath113 myr , but still less than the assumed agn lifetime of 20 myr . during the agn - on phase , the species @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 first rise to a peak and then fall as they are first ionised from lower ions to these states and then to higher ions , owing to the large increase in the radiation field . on the other hand , @xmath8 , which initially comprises 27% of carbon , decreases dramatically as carbon",
    "is ionised all the way to @xmath114 in under 10 myr .",
    "the column densities in the agn - on phase are applicable to proximate quasar absorption line ( qal ) systems observed near the background source quasar , or to intervening qal systems where the local ionising field is significantly enhanced by foreground agn near the sight line to the background source quasar .",
    "absorption systems with log[@xmath105@xmath106 will have @xmath6 column densities that are @xmath115 stronger than for the hm01 field where log[@xmath105@xmath116 at @xmath98 , while @xmath117 will be reduced by a factor of @xmath118 , and @xmath119 will be reduced even more .",
    "@xmath120 can either increase or decrease depending on the agn lifetime .",
    "@xmath7 is the most enhanced photo - ionised species shown , increasing more than @xmath121 in strength to @xmath122 .",
    "the temperature increases by @xmath123 to @xmath124 k due to photo - heating by the strongly increased ionising field ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the temperature increase results primarily from the ejection of highly energetic electrons by x - ray photons leading to high - ionisation metal species ( e.g.  @xmath125 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ) . for this solar - enriched case",
    ", metal photo - heating dominates over that from @xmath126 , which has a lower ionisation potential than metal ions .",
    "the photo - heating of @xmath2 does not contribute to the temperature increase , because in ionisation equilibrium the increase in the radiation field is exactly compensated by the corresponding decrease in the neutral fraction , and the latter is too small to result in significant non - equilibrium heating .",
    "the agn proximity zone fossil phase begins after the agn turns off and the ionisation field switches back to the uniform hm01 egb .",
    "the solid thin lines in the middle panel indicate the recombination timescales of the various species . although @xmath23 yr , @xmath117 reaches equilibrium in a much smaller timescale , @xmath127 yr , because the equilibrium neutral fraction it has to return to is only @xmath128 .",
    "in contrast , fossil ionised bubbles around dead quasars can persist for @xmath129 during reionisation since the equilibrium state is neutral @xcite ; however , we are considering only cases where an egb ionises the igm to a high level .",
    "@xmath117 remains slightly smaller than before @xmath110 , because photo - heating increased the temperature of the gas , thereby reducing the recombination rate .",
    "the cooling timescale of @xmath130 gyr means that the gas will take of order this time to approach the original equilibrium temperature and @xmath2 fraction .    even though the helium - like metal ion recombination timescales ( solid lines in the middle panel of figure [ fig : z09_tevol ] ) are @xmath131 shorter than for @xmath21 , their recombination lags are @xmath132 longer than for @xmath2 , because the equilibrium ion fractions are a significant fraction of unity .",
    "a case in point is the timescale of @xmath133 myr that it takes @xmath8 columns to approach their previous equilibrium values .",
    "a series of recombination timescales of species between @xmath114 and @xmath125 determine the total time it takes @xmath8 to return to equilibrium , since carbon is primarily in @xmath114 when the agn turns off .",
    "however , the longest is @xmath134 myr , shown as the green solid line in the middle panel .",
    "@xmath5 is significantly enhanced during @xmath135 myr after the agn turns off , even though its column density is decreased during the agn - on phase .",
    "@xmath5 achieves at least twice as large columns between 33 - 74 myr , as oxygen recombines from a majority of @xmath80 at @xmath136 myr to @xmath9 at @xmath137 myr .",
    "@xmath138 myr is the bottleneck slowing the recombination sequence ( orange solid line in the middle panel ) .",
    "the most dramatic residual observable change is for @xmath6 , for which columns increase 100 fold for the first 15 myr of the fossil phase and remain at least @xmath139 stronger for 50 myr . despite the main recombination bottleneck being @xmath140 myr , or about half",
    "as long as @xmath141 , @xmath6 takes several recombination times to approach its very low equilibrium value .",
    "thus @xmath142 , which has been observed and attributed to collisionally ionised gas at @xmath143 k @xcite , could have an alternative colder origin if nearby galaxies currently or recently harboured an agn .",
    "in passing , we note the recent work of @xcite , who find extremely strong high ionisation lines ( e.g. @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) in associated qso absorbers , which are possibly photo - ionised by the agn ; however , we note that those absorbers are probably located much nearer to the supermassive black hole than the extended proximity zones that are the focus of the present study . however , the same potential non - equilibrium fossil effects would apply , albeit on a shorter timescale given that the densities are likely much higher .",
    "our method presented here is general enough to be applied to short - term qso fluctuations that keep these zones over - ionised relative to equilibrium solutions .",
    "we have considered the very specific example of an agn proximity zone fossil applicable to enriched gas at densities typical of the circumgalactic medium .",
    "while our choices appear reasonable , we wish to broaden the range of physical parameters and situations by varying the metallicity , density , agn strength , and agn lifetime .",
    "we will relate these variations to situations that may occur in the real universe and will argue that fossil zones could significantly change the interpretation of metal qal observations .",
    "we will continue to assume that the metals are cool ( @xmath144 k ) , residing at the equilibrium temperature where photo - heating balances radiative cooling .",
    "* metallicity : * choosing solar metallicity for an absorption system is not unprecedented as detailed analysis of observed systems often yield solutions with solar or super - solar metallicities @xcite . however , many of these systems are attributed to lower density gas , which may on average be enriched to lower levels if metallicity increases with density as observations and simulations indicate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . lowering the metallicity does not alter the recombination timescales or behaviour significantly . the equilibrium temperature in the hm01 ionisation field increases from @xmath100 k for @xmath145 to @xmath146 k for @xmath147 , owing to reduced metal - line cooling , and this results in only a 0.2 dex reduction of @xmath117 .",
    "hence , metal - line strengths as a function of time can , to first order , be scaled with @xmath148 . however ,",
    "if intergalactic metals are poorly mixed on small scales as some observations and simulations indicate @xcite , then high metallicities may even be appropriate at low densities .",
    "* density : * changing the density alters the non - equilibrium behaviour because the recombination times scale as @xmath149 .",
    "the ionisation parameter also changes when assuming a constant radiation field , meaning that in equilibrium atomic species are photo - ionised to higher ion states at lower densities .",
    "we explore here four densities : @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 corresponding to @xmath154 overdensities @xmath155 , 24 , 77 , and 243 respectively .",
    "we assume an absorber length set by the @xcite relation ( @xmath156 kpc ) , which equals the jeans scale in a gas of uniform density and temperature .",
    "we set @xmath157 k in the previous equation for simplicity , even though temperatures vary .",
    "this size scale , which ranges from 230 to 42 kpc for our densities , has been shown to reproduce the observed sizes of the @xmath16 absorbers ( e.g * ? ? ?",

    "a slight deviation occurs for higher densities where photo - heating raises the temperature during the agn more , owing to the greater number of bound electrons available to ionise from metals .",

    "the @xmath8 column is almost always reduced , but not to the same extent as during the qso - on phase .",

    "more importantly , the multiplicative effects of agn with short duty cycles can significantly expand the volume affected by fossil zones .",

    "this duty cycle is relevant since the observed fraction of lbgs with active agn is @xmath281 @xcite , which could reflect their duty cycle .",
    "taking @xmath282 for @xmath186 means that the fossil effect applies to a @xmath283 greater volume than the proximity zone effect , and hence that 4% of the total volume is affected by @xmath284 .",
    "this volume fraction is similar to that thought to be required to account for the observed incidence of weak metal lines @xcite suggesting that non - equilibrium agn fossil zones may be critically important .",
    "finally , metal lines can be enhanced if @xmath285 , as is shown in figure [ fig : z25_qso_after ] for log[@xmath172]=@xmath245 , or @xmath286 .",
    "this leads to a doubling of the volume affected by both proximity and fossil zones , and @xmath8 is reduced by @xmath287 in almost every case .",
    "again , this arises because the agn euv spectrum is harder than that of the egb .",
    "we conclude that a large fraction of metal lines could arise from fossil zones at high-@xmath15 , but precisely what fraction depends on many factors .",
    "if the agn - on phase is long - lived and singular for most agn then the fossil effect would be limited . however",
    ", if agn are fluctuating with short duty cycles in typical star - forming galaxy hosts and have hard euv slopes , then the fossil effect could be a critical consideration for typical metal lines . we may have to re - evaluate the physical interpretation of @xmath8 and @xmath5 absorbers at high-@xmath15 , and the amount of underlying metals traced in diffuse gas .      [",
    "sec : app3 ]    our last case study are low - redshift metal absorbers associated with weaker agn , such as seyferts .",
    "we consider an admittedly idealised situation of a 10% duty cycle where the agn turns on for 1 myr out of every 10 myr at @xmath34 .",
    "we plot the time history of @xmath5 in figure [ fig : z025_seyferthist ] for three different field enhancements , to show how the continuous pumping resulting from a short duty cycle can even significantly enhance the ionisation around weak agns .",
    "we again assume @xmath98 solar - enriched gas at the equilibrium temperature of @xmath288 k.     columns ( top panel ) and gas temperature ( bottom panel ) for a @xmath98 , @xmath289 kpc solar metallicity absorber at @xmath34 , where an agn of the listed intensity turns on for 1 myr every 10 myr starting at @xmath110 .",
    "the periodic agn activity significantly enhances @xmath5 columns and doubles the gas temperature over 200 myr in the most extreme case via photo - heating of metals .",
    "this case could be applicable for metals around normal looking galaxies if agn duty cycles are short and have frequencies comparable to the @xmath5 recombination timescale . ]",
    "this situation may be applicable to markarian galaxies in the local universe .",
    "these are among the biggest , brightest spirals , and have an unusually blue central core that usually requires non - thermal emission , which often indicates agn activity .",
    "about 10% of markarians are seyferts @xcite , which motivates our choice of a 10% duty cycle . of course , not all markarians are seyferts with a short duty cycle , but we consider the possibility that @xmath29010% of markarians were more active agns in the recent past ( i.e.  in the last @xmath253 myr ) .",
    "the three cases plotted in figure [ fig : z025_seyferthist ] , @xmath291 , @xmath292 , and @xmath293 correspond to soft x - ray luminosities at 100 proper kpc of @xmath294 , @xmath295 , and @xmath296 agn , respectively , using our agn template spectrum .",
    "these luminosities are in the range of seyfert x - ray luminosities observed by @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : z025_seyferthist ] shows that the temperature doubles to @xmath297 k in the strongest case .",
    "we tabulate the time - averaged enhancements of @xmath8 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 over 200 myr , or the first 20 cycles , for a grid of densities ( log[@xmath108/@xmath298 ) and agn fluxes ( log[@xmath299/(@xmath68 ) ] ) in figure [ fig : z025_seyferttable ] .",
    "similar to figure [ fig : z25_qso_after ] , the second column in each table shows column densities ( log[@xmath300/@xmath301 ) using the hm01 egb ( here at @xmath34 ) , absorber lengths according to @xcite , @xmath302 k before the agn turns on , and solar metallicity .",
    "the grid cells to the right indicate the column density change @xmath239log[@xmath240 relative to the hm01 equilibrium , colour - coded to be redder if the column density goes down due to the agn and bluer if it goes up .",
    "the @xmath108 densities correspond to overdensities ranging from 27 to 8500 .",
    "while we show solar metallicity , the change is similar for lower metallicities .",
    "the main point of this diagram is to show that even for a 10% agn duty cycle , the time - averaged columns are significantly changed , mostly in a positive direction for these higher metal ions . while there has never been a survey designed to probe the halos of galaxies showing signs of on - going or recent agn activity in the low - redshift universe , it may be worth exploring in light of the cos observations of @xcite revealing very strong @xmath5 around normal spiral , star - forming galaxies at @xmath303 .",
    "markarian galaxies , for example , may show even stronger @xmath5 if this gas originates from a photo - ionised component at @xmath304 k.",
    "the assumption of a uniform extra - galactic background ( egb ) breaks down in an agn proximity zone , which is over - ionised relative to the rest of the igm .",
    "@xmath2 columns are reduced and metals are ionised to higher states owing to increased photo - ionisation .",
    "we demonstrate here that once the agn turns off , metals residing in `` fossil '' agn proximity zones may remain over - ionised for timescales exceeding the typical agn - on phase . using the non - equilibrium code introduced in @xcite , we follow metal - enriched gases initially ionised by the egb @xcite under the effect of increased ionisation from a local agn . after the agn turns off",
    ", metal ions in fossil proximity zones often require many myr to return to the equilibrium values , owing to the significant recombination times of metal ion species .",
    "we demonstrate how this non - equilibrium fossil effect alters observational metal - line diagnostics used to constrain the physical state of intergalactic and circum - galactic gas .",
    "in particular , we show that commonly observed lithium - like ions ( i.e.  @xmath8 , @xmath91 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) can be heavily affected at a range of redshifts from the present - day to z@xmath305 .",
    "this behaviour is in contrast to @xmath2 , which re - equilibrates comparatively rapidly once an agn turns off , owing to its equilibrium state having very low neutral fractions in the igm .",
    "we consider metal - enriched gas with densities @xmath306 at @xmath307 and 0.25 , which corresponds to diffuse igm and cgm gas , that is initially in thermal equilibrium ( @xmath30 k ) .",
    "our parameter choices are motivated by hydrodynamic simulations , which show a significant fraction of diffuse metals in thermal equilibrium , where cooling balances photo - heating , owing to short cooling times from higher temperatures ( @xmath308 k ) .",
    "the gas begins in ionisation equilibrium with the hm01 egb , and becomes irradiated by an agn template spectrum turned on for 1 to 20 myr corresponding to an ionisation increase of between @xmath309 the egb radiation field strength at the lyman limit .",
    "our fiducial case corresponds to a local agn turning on at @xmath90 , a redshift for which a wide range of metal lines are observable with current facilities ( e.g.  cos on hst ) and which corresponds to the @xcite observations of very strong @xmath6 absorption in a system associated with a galaxy exhibiting post - starburst and possible agn signatures .",
    "we show that for reasonable agn energies , @xmath6 columns are increased by a factor of @xmath310 during a 20 myr agn - on phase and also during the 15 myr in the following fossil phase , and remain @xmath311 stronger for 50 myr after the agn turns off .",
    "we show for a variety of gas densities , agn strengths , and agn lifetimes that @xmath6 columns of @xmath312 are possible for significant timescales during the fossil phase for solar abundances .",
    "we directly model the components of the @xmath12 pg1206 + 459 absorber @xcite , finding a single phase model that successfully fits @xmath6 , @xmath10 , @xmath2 , and other metal columns assuming @xmath313 , @xmath13 k gas in a fossil zone several myr after a strong qso turned off .",
    "our application to this absorption system demonstrates that a whole new class of non - equilibrium solutions are available for metal - enriched diffuse gas in the presence of evolving ionisation fields .",
    "we also model agn ionisation at @xmath231 , including the transverse proximity effect for a foreground qso zone in a qso pair , where observed @xmath264 and @xmath263 line ratios indicate enhanced ionisation over the normal egb @xcite .",
    "we first show that active proximity zones can exhibit these unique ratios , and then consider how the non - equilibrium fossil effect can alter @xmath8 and @xmath5 columns for timescales longer than the agn lifetime .",
    "unique line ratios are possible where @xmath2 has rapidly re - equilibrated but the metal lines are still recombining .",
    "we argue that it is plausible that fossil zones could affect many more absorbers in the high-@xmath15 universe than agn proximity zones if agns fluctuate with short duty cycles , have hard extreme uv slopes , and are associated with typical star - forming galaxies , which prolifically enrich the igm .",
    "a large fraction of intervening metal absorbers in typical qso spectra may well be affected by the fossil effect , meaning that ionisation corrections assuming a uniform egb would be wrong .",
    "@xmath8 columns are almost always reduced in fossils meaning that the true diffuse gas metallicity becomes higher than when one assumes equilibrium with the egb field .",
    "finally , we consider lower redshift agn ionising their surrounding cgm with a 10% duty cycle where the agn is on for 1 out of every 10 myr . despite this short duty cycle ,",
    "high ions ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) are significantly enhanced , often by more than 1 dex , and temperatures are increased by a factor of two for stronger fields .",
    "the key to these increases of metal columns and temperature are that the photo - ionisation / photo - heating timescales are short or comparable to the agn lifetime , while the recombination / cooling timescales are long or comparable to the duty cycle interval .",
    "the result is intriguing in that surprisingly little energy input is necessary to greatly enhance metal columns in the halo of fluctuating typical agn .",
    "these non - equilibrium fossil and proximity zone effects may complicate the analysis of intergalactic metal lines that assume photo - ionisation equilibrium with a uniform egb .",
    "for example , cosmological hydrodynamic simulations using such assumptions underestimate the observed number density of the highest equivalent width @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath5 absorbers @xcite , unless a sub - grid turbulence model is invoked post - run .",
    "proximity zone fossils could provide an alternative model for such strong , highly ionised metal absorbers .",
    "the fossil effect is unique in that @xmath2 re - equilibrates rapidly while metal lines remain over - ionised leading to different ionisation corrections to obtain metallicities",
    ". this could be particularly important during the quasar era , @xmath314 , for which we find that the fraction of the volume occupied by fossil zones may be similar to the fraction that is thought to be enriched with heavy elements .",
