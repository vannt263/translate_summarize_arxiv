    "in a recent paper @xcite , we introduced the idea of phase space crystals , i.e. , a lattice structure in phase space created by breaking a continuous phase rotational symmetry via a driving field . in our previous work we used the model of ultracold atoms trapped in a time - dependent power - law potential ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath0 , to illustrate our idea . however , this model is technically difficult to realize in experiments . here , we present a realistic driven optical lattice model , i.e , the power - law driving is replaced by a cosine - type driving , i.e. , @xmath1 , to realize phase space crystals .",
    "thus , the novel phenomena predicted by phase space crystals can be directly observed in current experiments of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "the model proposed here synthesizes a more complex lattice structure in phase space and thus contains rich physics .",
    "we further develop the theory of phase space crystals and calculate the complex quantum tunnelling rates .",
    "we identify the artificial ( magnetic ) gauge field in phase space , which is a result of the noncommutative geometry of the phase space crystal .",
    "compared to the artificial lattice structures in real space @xcite , synthesizing a lattice structure in phase space has the key advantage of being conveniently tunable in experiments through changes in the driving field . due to this possibility phase space lattices",
    "may provide a new platform to simulate condensed matter phenomena .    * ultracold atoms in driven optical lattice .",
    "* ultracold atoms ( green dots ) are confined in a harmonic potential ( red parabolic curve ) .",
    "the ground sate of confinement potential is represented by a gaussian wave packet ( yellow wave packet ) with width @xmath2 .",
    "the blue curve represents a propagating optical lattice with period @xmath3 , amplitude @xmath4 and velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the potential for creating phase space lattice is the sum of them . ]",
    "the model we propose here can be realized by ultracold atoms trapped in a time - dependent optical lattice .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath6 here , the parabolic term is the harmonic confinement potential of ultracold atoms , which can be created by a gaussian beam profile of a laser @xcite or introduced by another external field . as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig drivenopticallattice ] , the characteristic length of the ground state in the confinement potential is @xmath7 .",
    "experimentally the optical lattice is created by the interference of two counter - propagating laser beams , which form an optical standing wave with period @xmath8 .",
    "the ultracold atoms are trapped by the interaction between the laser light field and the oscillating dipole moment of atoms induced by the laser light @xcite .",
    "we can drive the optical lattice simply by tuning the phase difference of the two laser beams linearly as described by hamiltonian ( [ drivenopticallattice ] ) .",
    "effectively , this creates a propagating optical lattice with a velocity of @xmath5 .",
    "an important parameter is @xmath9 , which defines the  quantumness \" of our system .",
    "it is large in the quantum regime and goes to zero in the semiclassical limit .",
    "we emphasize that the optical potential is time - dependent and the confinement potential also plays an important role .",
    "thus , our system does not have spatial periodicity and the bloch theory in real space does not apply directly for the hamiltonian ( [ drivenopticallattice ] ) .            in this section ,",
    "we calculate the squeezing factor @xmath11 of localized states near the stable points of phase space lattice .",
    "first , we determine the all the extrema @xmath12 including stable points and unstable saddle points by the derivatives of quasienergy ( [ classicalg ] ) along both angular direction and radial direction @xmath13 the angular extrema can be obtained from eq.([extreme1a ] ) , that is , @xmath14 with @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is defined as _ lattice constant _ of phase space lattice . to get the radial extrema",
    ", we need to solve the equation ( [ extreme1b ] ) .",
    "the stability of these extrema @xmath12 is determined by the second derivatives of @xmath17 .",
    "if @xmath18 , the extrema are stable , otherwise unstable .",
    "the second derivatives to angle @xmath19 and radius @xmath20 are @xmath21 below , we label the stable points ( maxima and minima ) and unstable saddle points by @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we expand the quasienergy @xmath17 near the stable points @xmath22 to the second order @xmath24 here , we have defined coordinate @xmath25 and momentum @xmath26 near the stable point .",
    "the effective mass @xmath27 and effective frequency @xmath28 are given by @xmath29 respectively .",

    "the squeezing parameters are given by @xmath34 .",

    "then we move the hamiltonian to the position of stable point using displacement operator @xmath39 . finally , we squeeze the hamiltonian to fit the stable point using squeezing operator @xmath40/2}$ ] . by choosing @xmath41",
    "we get the localized hamiltonian as following @xmath42      we investigate the quantum dynamics near the bottom of a stable state .",
