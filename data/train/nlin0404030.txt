    "during the last decade , some of the present authors have achieved the synthesis of crystalline high - temperature polymorphs of rare earth ( re ) disilicates ( re@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2 ) at non - expected temperatures , significantly lower than those previously reported , through a reconstructive process ( ltrt ) from clay minerals as the silicon source  @xcite .",
    "this finding is of general importance in the development of advanced structural ceramics  @xcite or the storage of radioactive wastes  @xcite and should allow completion of the available si  o@xmath1-re@xmath1o@xmath3 phase diagram  @xcite . although no precise explanation has been found up to now , some of the present authors had previously suggested a _",

    "mackay and aubry  @xcite have suggested that a possible effect of the existence of localized nonlinear vibrations , named discrete breathers ( dbs ) could be an apparent violation of arrhenius law , i.e. , the phenomenon of chemical reactions taking place at much lower temperatures than expected .",
    "although this hypothesis is adventurous , it is worth exploring .",
    "moreover , experimental evidence of dbs has already been found in several systems such as antiferromagnets  @xcite , waveguide arrays  @xcite , molecular crystals  @xcite or josephson - junctions  @xcite . moving dbs",
    "have been proposed as an explanation of dark tracks in muscovite  @xcite and there existence in muscovite has just been proven through a sputtering experiment  @xcite .    with this aim ,",
    "we have made calculations and shown that the contribution of dbs can provide an interpretation for ltrt in clay minerals . and",
    "in order to give experimental support to the hypothesis of dbs , it will be shown that the ltrt phenomenon is not exclusive of expandable clay minerals , as expected by the previously suggested `` chimie douce '' mechanism  @xcite , but also extensible to non - expandable layered silicates , such as mica muscovite .",
    "the layout of this work consists of : section  2 : some structural considerations on the reconstructive nature of transformation of layered silicates into disilicates ; section  3 : a report on a new experiment on ltrt performed by the authors on mica muscovite ; section  4 : argumentation about the difficulty to explain by the conventional chemical kinetics model the latter experiment ; section  5 : description of an alternative model based on dbs with numerical calculations ; section  6 : after a summary of breather statistics theory , the description of our numerical simulations and the consequences on the reaction rate , we conclude with the possibility of explaining , for the first time , the ltrt phenomenon in the synthesis of high - temperature polymorphs of silicates by the contribution of dbs .",
    "the article in itself is ended with a summary .",
    "two appendices give some detail on phonon and breather statistics respectively .",
    "the synthesis of disilicates from layered silicates , expandable as clay minerals or non - expandable as mica , actually means a reconstructive transformation as shown below .",
    "layered silicates are made up from two basic building blocks : a sheet of edge - sharing [ sio@xmath4 units , the tetrahedral sheet , and another one of edge - sharing [ mo@xmath5 , the octahedral sheet .",
    "there are three main groups of layered silicate minerals , according to the combinations of tetrahedral and octahedral sheets : 1:1 , 2:1 and 2:1:1 . in 2:1",
    ", one octahedral sheet is sandwiched between the apices of two tetrahedral ones . in these , also called t - o - t silicates , layers are either held together by weak van der waals forces if they are neutral , or may have cations between them for charge balance if substitutions in either tetrahedral or octahedral sheet result in a net layer charge .",
    "the 2:1 layered silicates are classified as trioctahedral or dioctahedral , after the full occupation of the octahedral sheet by mg(ii ) or two thirds by al(iii ) .",
    "talc ( trioctahedral ) and pyrophillite ( dioctahedral ) are minerals with non - charged layers . in the case of low charge",
    ", it results that the clay minerals have the capacity to expand by taking up h@xmath1o molecules in the interlayer space . for high charge , there is mica : phlogopite ( trioctahedral ) and muscovite ( dioctahedral ) .",
    "muscovite is a mica which layer charge comes from the isomorphic substitution of silicon by aluminium in the tetrahedral sheet  @xcite .",
    "the potassium located in the interlayer space , for charge balance , can not be hydrated ; thus , muscovite does not expand .",
    "its structure is depicted at the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : unitcell ] . at its right ,",
    "the interlayer space of muscovite is illustrated and it can be observed that both surfaces of the upper and lower tetrahedral sheet are formed by the basal oxygen atoms from the [ sio@xmath4 tetrahedra , which form a rough hexagonal honeycomb structure .",
    "the interlayer balancing sheet is therefore sandwiched in between , potassium occupying the dimples left at the centre of each pair of hexagonal cells . in real crystals , although the on - site potential created by the silicate layer tends to preserve the symmetry , there are always distortions like tetrahedral rotation ( the actual situation in muscovite is shown in this figure ) .",
    "each potassium ion is surrounded by six other potassium ions in the interlayer sheet with a ditrigonal symmetry .",
    "the distance between the potassium and the basal oxygens layers is 1.45  .",

    "however , disilicates , or pyrosilicates , are the simplest of the condensed forms , where only two tetrahedra share one edge and constitutes the anion si@xmath1o@xmath2@xmath9 ( fig  [ fig : disili ] ) .",
    "the transformation of any layered - silicate into disilicate involves the rupture of two silicon - oxygen bonds by each [ sio@xmath4 , whatever the reaction mechanism might be , the transformation being reconstructive .",
    "it is well - known that natural pyrosilicates show a wide range of si - o - si angle , from 131@xmath0 to 180@xmath0  @xcite , and that the activation energy is reduced if the surface and strain energy terms are diminished by good lattice matching across the interface between the new and parent phase .",
    "however , this is not the present case .",
    "it rather seems that the disruption of the tetrahedral sheet could be the consequence of localized nonlinear vibration modes as commented in the introduction and explained in the following sections .",
    "the method used by us to synthesize re - disilicates consists of a hydrothermal reconstructive process at low temperatures in an isolated reaction vessel constructed in our laboratory .",
    "a layered silicate and an aqueous solution are the silicon and re(iii ) sources , respectively . up to now , a set of expandable clay minerals had been studied , rendering conclusions on the relationship between mineralogical compositions and reactivity  @xcite .",
    "the reaction temperatures were always below the critical one of water ; thus both vapour and liquid phases coexist throughout the whole reaction .",
    "reconstructive structural changes occurring in the layered silicate are always analyzed studying the long - range order by x - ray powder diffraction ( xrd ) , the chemical environment of the main constituent elements of the lattice by magic - angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( mas - nmr ) and the microstructural and microchemical composition by electron microscopy ( sem ) and by energy - dispersive x - ray ( edx ) .",
    "as it has been already mentioned , it has been suggested  @xcite that dbs might bring about an apparent violation of arrhenius law , leading to chemical reactions being observable at much lower temperatures than expected  @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that dbs in the interlayer potassium sheet may be responsible for the dark lines observed in crystals of mica muscovite  @xcite and the existence of moving breathers in mica has been recently proven through a sputtering experiment  @xcite .",
    "it implies a ltrt process occurring in a nonexpendable layered silicate , which contradicts the mechanism published by some of the present authors to explain the synthesis of re - disilicates as associated to the capacity for expanding  @xcite . in order to confirm experimentally the hypothesis that the ltrt phenomenon is not an exclusive feature of clay minerals , but",
    "can also be attributed to non - expandable layered silicates , we have performed the hydrothermal synthesis of lu - disilicate from muscovite , under the same experimental conditions as those used for clay minerals .    when muscovite is hydrothermally treated in stainless steel reactors at 300 @xmath0c for 72 hours with lutetium nitrate 0.05 m solution , it gives rise to lu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ fig : xrd]a shows the xrd diagram of the untreated muscovite .",
    "it reveals numerous hkl basal reflections compatible with the 2m@xmath10 polytype and a perfect ordering of the layers .",
    "after the hydrothermal treatment , the xrd pattern shown in figure  [ fig : xrd]b exhibits a number of specific reflections which are consistent with the development of a new crystalline phase lu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2 ( jcpds file number 76 - 1871 ) . the sem photograph of the mica shows big flakes whereas the sample submitted to hydrothermal treatment , in addition reveals irregular , rough particles , which correspond to lu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath11si mas nmr spectra of both expandable and non  expandable layered silicates show an evolution from q@xmath12 silicon environment to q@xmath13 environment  @xcite .",
    "this result supports that the ltrt phenomenon is common to expandable and non - expandable layered silicates , both containing an interlayer sheet of cations to balance the layer charge .",
    "the composition of the rough particle inside the circle is compatible with lu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2 ]    note that although the hydrothermal treatment of layered silicates , muscovite and others , is , effectively , at the origin of the development of a new crystalline phase , as a necessary experimental condition , it is not sufficient . in the case of a silicon source different from a layered silicate , which has been used by the authors for the first time , the process does not occur .",
    "an example is illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ fig : silice ] .",
    "this figure shows the @xmath11si mas nmr of sio@xmath1 submitted to a hydrothermal treatment at 300  @xmath0c ( b ) and the typical spectrum of the lutetium disilicate ( a ) .",
    "the signal of the sio@xmath1 after hydrothermal treatment remains in the chemical shift range typical of q@xmath15 environment ( typical of sio@xmath1 ) , which is clearly different for q@xmath13 environment ( typical for the new phase lu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2 ) .",
    "thus , it demonstrates that under hydrothermal condition , sio@xmath1 does not transform in a new phase .",

    "transformation processes of minerals in which there is a major reorganization with bonds and , even , change in the chemical composition are classified as _ reconstructive_. these obey mechanisms which involve very high activation energies when the rupture of strong bonds are involved .",
    "synthesis of re - disilicates from layered silicates requires the rupture of silicon - oxygen bonds , which are considerably stronger than the bonds between any other element and oxygen .",
    "silicate minerals make up the vast majority of rocks and their reconstructive transformation processes show activation energies as high as 200 kj / mol or even higher  @xcite .",
    "therefore , these transformations can be observed in silicate - based minerals at temperatures higher than approximately 1000  @xmath0c and are apparently impossible at lower ones .",
    "it is well known that the over - all effect on temperature on the reaction rate constant @xmath16 is expressed by arrhenius law : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the frequency factor and the activation energy , respectively . according to it , and without any further insight into the mechanism ,",
    "the rate of a reaction is about @xmath20 times faster at 1000  @xmath0c than it is at 300  @xmath0c for an activation energy of 200 kj / mol .",
    "it can be shown that the second parameter in the arrhenius law , namely , the frequency factor @xmath18 , does not support ltrt synthesis of re - disilicates as well .",
    "usually , reaction rates are described within the frame of the quasi ",
    "equilibrium activated state model  @xcite . according to the latter",
    ", the necessary condition for a transformation to take place at a measurable rate is that a sufficient number of atoms have enough energy to achieve the transition state .",
    "this energy is supplied by thermal fluctuations .",
    "the rate of reaction is then simply the number of activated complexes passing per second over the potential barrier .    applying the conventional transition state ( activated complex ) theory  @xcite to our case",

    ", the rhs of the above expression should be multiplied by a factor @xmath27 , the transmission coefficient , which is the probability that the complex will dissociate into products instead of back into reactants . for most reactions",
    "@xmath27 is between 0.5 and 1.0  @xcite . through a thermodynamic formulation of @xmath24 ,",
    "it results : @xmath28 where the superindex @xmath29 stands for normal conditions . in liquid and solid systems ,",
    "the @xmath30 term is negligible and @xmath31 .    at 300@xmath0c",
    "we have calculated the factor @xmath18 by substitution of all the parameters in the above expression and it takes the usual value @xmath32 s@xmath33 for a first order reaction .",
    "it does not explain the observation of ltrt synthesis of re - disilicates as previously concluded from @xmath19 .",
    "it is well known that , in parallel to the reorganization of the clay , there must be nucleation of re@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2 crystals and that the activation energy is reduced if the surface and strain energy terms are diminished by good lattice matching across the interface between the new and parent phase  @xcite . however , this is not the present case .",

    "the percentages of @xmath34- and @xmath36- phases in the cases of saponite and laponite are explained in ref .   as related with the presence of al(iii ) in the precursor framework .",
    "moreover , the importance of maintaining the local si - o - si bond angle of precursor structure is shown by the fact that the @xmath36polymorph has been synthesized at more than 365@xmath0c below the stability range shown in the phase diagram : @xmath39    at the present stage of dbs application to understanding the ltrt phenomenon , other experimental results already published by our group , such as the influence of isomorphic substitution in clay minerals on the reactivity of the latter , are still awaiting their explanation .",
    "we hope that the further work on db in solid state physics will permit to interpret all those experimental results in the near future .",
    "as commented above , it has been predicted that discrete breathers could bring about an increase of the reaction rate  @xcite .",

    "first , since a discrete breather is strongly localized , it seems much more capable of delivering the energy for breaking a bond , which implies that @xmath111 should in effect be much larger than @xmath18 .",
    "second , for larger systems than the one used in our simulations , the fluctuations may have larger energies and , therefore , excite other types of breathers with higher energies , as , for example , breathers with frequencies above the phonon band , which have energies between 240 and 500  kj / mol .",
    "these breathers would increase the fraction of breathers above the activation energy and therefore the reaction rate .",
    "low temperature reconstructive transformations ( ltrt ) have been achieved in layered silicated by some of the authors at temperatures about 600@xmath0c lower than previously reported .",
    "this is a phenomenon for which there is presently no plausible explanation since the bonds involved are the same as in other transformations .",
    "new experiments performed by some of the authors on mica muscovite , a non - expandable silicate have discarded their previous hypothesis of ltrt been caused by the expansion of the intersheet layer .",
    "we have constructed a model for breathers in the cation later , for which we have obtained reasonable parameters , and with a mixture of numerics and theory we have estimated their effect in the reaction rate .",
    "the results are that they would increase enormously the reaction rate and , thus , explain the observed ltrt .",
    "this can be easily explained by the fact that , although there are much less breathers than phonons , there are many more with energies above the expected activation energy .",
    "certainly , the statistical theory of breathers is only an approximation , and the numerics can not be precise at larger energies for which there are so few breathers , except if an enormous number of simulations could be performed .",
    "however , an established fact in breather theory is that large breathers have longer life time than small ones and thus tend to overpopulate the regions of high energies if compared to maxwell - boltzmann statistics for phonons . moreover , as they are localized , it seems that they can deliver more easily the required energy to break bonds .",
    "the sum of this facts , i.e. , localization , much higher number of breathers above a given activation energy and apparent diminution of the activation energy suggests that dbs are good candidates to explain ltrts .",
