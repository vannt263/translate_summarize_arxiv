    "the concept of extended causality @xcite allows a formalism for field theory in terms of discrete point - like fields with localized point - interactions and free of singularities and divergences .",
    "one can see a classical field theory in terms of these discrete point - like fields as a kind of pre - quantum field theory .",
    "it is relevant for pointing the way to a finite description of fundamental fields in terms of point - like objects , a simpler and reliable possible alternative to string motivated approaches to a finite field theory .",
    "its relevance increases with the anticipated information that this formalism has also successfully been applied @xcite for describing the gravitational field of general relativity in terms of finite point - like fields , although this will not be discussed here . in this note",
    "we write classical electrodynamics in the context of extended causality , and we describe the discrete field of a classical spinless point electron .",
    "+ for completeness , we start in section ii with a brief review from references @xcite about extended causality and its applications to classical field theory .",
    "we discuss the meaning of the fields and of their equations in this formalism , the green s functions , their interpretation in terms of creation and annihilation of particles , and how the standard formalism is retrieved in terms of lightcone - averaged fields .",
    "then we discuss the role of virtual ( unphysical ) photons .",
    "there is no virtual photons in a formalism with extended causality but they necessarily must be included for retrieving the standard formalism . + in section iii we show the structure of the radiation field of a spinless point electron .",

    "finally , in section v , we study the photon energy - momentum and we retrieve the larmor theorem .",
    "in standard field theory formalism the evolution of a free field is constrained by [ 1 ] ^2=-x^2 ,    where @xmath1 is the change of proper time associated to the four - vector @xmath2 in a minkowski spacetime of metric @xmath3 . in our notation",
    "we omit the spacetime indices when this does not compromise the text comprehension .",

    "<S> the classical electromagnetic field of a spinless point electron is described in a formalism with extended causality by discrete finite point - vector fields with discrete and localized point interactions . </S>",
    "<S> these fields are taken as a classical representation of photons ,  classical photons \" . </S>",
    "<S> they are all transversal photons ; there are no scalar nor longitudinal photons and the lorentz gauge condition is automatically satisfied . the angular distribution of emitted photons reproduces the directions of maximum emission of the standard formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the maxwell formalism in terms of continuous and distributed fields is retrieved by the smearing of these discrete fields over the light - cone , and in this process scalar and longitudinal photons are necessarily created and added . </S>",
    "<S> divergences and singularities are by - products of this averaging process . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete and the continuous formalisms are not equivalent . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete one is superior for not having divergencies , singularities , unphysical degrees of freedom , for describing processes of creation and annihilation of particles instead of advanced solutions , for having a natural explanation for the photon , and for generating the continuous formalism as an effective one . </S>",
    "<S> it enlightens the meaning and the origin of the non - physical photons in the standard formalism . </S>",
    "<S> the standard theory based on average continuous fields is more convenient and appropriate for dealing with a large number of charges and for relatively large distances , but for few charges or for the field configuration in a charge close neighbourhood the discrete field description is mandatorily required for avoiding inconsistencies .    </S>",
