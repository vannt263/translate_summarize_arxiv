    "for computer science , to generate objects in a combinatorial class efficiently such that each element is generated exactly once is an important problem .",
    "a common approach is to try to generate combinatorial objects such that successive elements differ only in a small way .",
    "a mathematical model of this approach is the _ combinatorial gray codes_. the term combinatorial gray codes was first appeared in @xcite .",
    "it is used to refer to any method for generating objects in a combinatorial class so that the successive objects differ in some pre - specified , usually small , way .",
    "there are many examples of minimal change listings of combinatorial objects and see savage s survey paper @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we construct two listings for the vertices of the _ augmentation graph _ introduced in @xcite and provide two gray codes for @xmath2 , the @xmath1-@xmath3 avoiding permutations of length @xmath4 .",
    "there are several results about gray codes for pattern avoiding permutations .",
    "the most fundamental cases are the permutations of size @xmath4 avoiding a single pattern of length three . in @xcite , dukes et al . gave gray codes for large families of pattern avoiding permutations .",
    "more precisely , they provided gray codes for permutations avoiding a regular set of patterns .",
    "in particular , they constructed gray codes for the set of all permutations of size @xmath4 avoiding any pattern @xmath5 , where two consecutive permutations differ in four or five positions .",
    "in @xcite , baril presented gray codes for @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where two consecutive permutations permutations differ at most three positions and it is optimal for odd @xmath4 .",
    "their method is based on constructing generating trees @xcite .    also , by the reverse and complement operations and their composition , there are five symmetry classes avoiding two pattern of length three , they are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the set @xmath13 is empty set for @xmath14 .",
    "also it is straightforward to see that @xmath9 and @xmath10 have no gray codes such that successive permutations differ at most @xmath15 transpositions , where the constant @xmath15 does not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , consider @xmath16 .",
    "juarna and vajnovszki gave a gray code for @xmath11 in @xcite.we give two gray codes for the remaining case @xmath12 , in which two adjacent elements differ by at most two adjacent transpositions and two adjacent transpositions jumps do not appear successively .",
    "we use one - line notation , i.e. , we denote a permutation @xmath17 by the sequence @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the set of all permutations on @xmath20 .    for two permutations @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we call they differ by an adjacent transposition if and only if @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for some @xmath27 . in other words , @xmath28 can be obtained from @xmath29 by changing adjacent entries .",
    "for example , @xmath30 and @xmath31 differ by an adjacent transposition , changing the second and the third entries .",
    "similarly , we call two permutations of same size @xmath28 and @xmath29 differ by two adjacent transpositions if and only if @xmath32 and there exists a permutation @xmath33 such that @xmath28 and @xmath33 differ by an adjacent transposition and also @xmath33 and @xmath29 do .",
    "for example , @xmath30 and @xmath34 differ by two adjacent transpositions .",
    "we say that @xmath28 and @xmath29 differ by at most two adjacent transpositions if @xmath28 and @xmath29 differ by an adjacent transposition or two adjacent transpositions .",
    "one can also define when two permutations differ by at most @xmath15 adjacent transpositions .    for @xmath35 and @xmath36 with @xmath37",
    ", we say that a permutation @xmath38 has a @xmath39-@xmath40 if @xmath41 for some @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is a permutation in @xmath44 defined by the following process : the smallest value of @xmath45 is replaced with @xmath46 , the second smallest value is replaced with @xmath47 , and so on .",
    "we call @xmath43 the @xmath48 of @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath49 for any @xmath42 , we say that @xmath38 is a @xmath39-@xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "we denote the set of @xmath39- avoiding permutations of size @xmath4 by @xmath52 and also let @xmath53 denote the set of permutations of size @xmath4 avoiding each pattern in @xmath54 .",
    "the most popular results on pattern avoidance are the enumerations of permutations avoiding a pattern of length three , which is enumerated by the @xmath55 @xcite @xcite @xcite . for further information on pattern avoidance ,",
    "see @xcite .      in this section ,",
    "we give several notations from graph theory , see diestel s basic text @xcite .",
    "a _ graph _ is a pair @xmath56 of sets such that @xmath57 .",
    "sometimes we denote @xmath58 for short .",
    "the elements of @xmath59 is called @xmath60 and that of @xmath61 is called _",
    "edges_. for @xmath62 , the _ induced subgraph _ on @xmath63 is the graph with vertex set @xmath63 and whose edge set consists of all of the edges in @xmath61 that have both endpoints in @xmath63 .    a _ path _ is a listing of vertices such that consecutive vertices are adjacent in the graph and the vertices are all distinct .",
    "the _ length _ of a path is the number of vertices minus one .",
    "for example , an edge is a path with two vertices and its length equals @xmath46 .",
    "cycle _ is a path such that the starting vertex and the ending vertex are adjacent .",
    "a graph is called _ connected _ if there are paths containing each pair of vertices . for a connected graph @xmath58 and two vertices @xmath64 ,",
    "the _ distance _ between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is the length of a shortest path from @xmath65 to @xmath66 and we denote it by @xmath67 .",
    "hamiltonian  path _",
    "_ hamiltonian  cycle _ ) is a path ( resp .",
    "cycle ) that visits each vertex exactly once .",
    "a listing of a combinatorial object is a sequence such that each element appears exactly once .",
    "let @xmath68 be combinatorial objects with @xmath69 and @xmath70 and @xmath71 be listings of @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "put @xmath74 , i.e. , a _ concatenation _ of @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which is a listing of @xmath75 .",
    "in this section , we recall the definition of the _ augmentation  graphs _ introduced in @xcite . in @xcite , the augmentation graph of rank @xmath4 is defined on the subsets of @xmath20 . in this paper",
    ", we define a graph @xmath76 on the set of all binary sequences of length @xmath4 , which isomorphic to augmentation graph .",
    "1 .   @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 or 2 .",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 for some @xmath27 and @xmath85 for @xmath24 .",
    "+ in other words , connect two vertices if and only if they only differ in the first positions or differ only by an interchange of a @xmath86 and a @xmath46 in adjacent positions .",
    "the graph isomorphic to @xmath76 is defined at savage s survey paper @xcite at section 2 , which is called an augmentation graph of size @xmath4 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "hamiltonian paths are not known for this graph .        for a listing of @xmath89 , we denote it by @xmath90 , such that every distance of successive vertices is less than @xmath47 , we call that distance @xmath47 jumps do not appear consecutively in the listing if there are no @xmath91 such that @xmath92 .    for @xmath93 and @xmath94 ,",
