    "they started with the partridge & schwenke ( 1997 ) theoretical line list and improved the accuracy of both the line positions and strengths .",

    "( 2004 ) to model the spectrum of v1331 cyg . as in carr et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , the observed spectrum is modeled under the assumption of keplerian rotation and thermal level populations ( see also carr et al .",
    "1993 ; najita et al .",
    "the disk model parameters include a stellar mass , the projected rotational velocity @xmath52 at the inner radius of the emission , the inner and outer radii of the emission , and the temperature and column density distribution for the emitting gas , both parameterized as power laws in radius . the distance and observed velocity shift are additional parameters .",
    "since the stellar properties of v1331 cyg ( distance , spectral type , extinction ) are poorly known , the modeling that we present for the molecular emission from v1331 cyg is not meant to provide a definitive interpretation of the emission from the source . instead , the modeling has the limited goal of demonstrating that the observed emission features are consistent with water and co emission from a differentially rotating disk . a more detailed discussion of the properties of the molecular emission will be presented in a future publication .    in this context , we assume a stellar mass of @xmath53 which is consistent with estimates for the bolometric luminosity of the source ( @xmath54 ; hamann & persson 1992 ; shevchenko et al .",
    "1991 ) and the range of spectral types estimated in the literature ( a8k2 ; chavarria 1981 ; hamann & persson 1992 ) .",
    "we also assume a distance of 550pc ( shevchenko et al .  1991 ; alves et al .  1998 ) .",
    "with the combination of stellar spectral type and extinction preferred by chavarria ( 1981 ; f0 and @xmath55 ) and our assumed stellar luminosity of @xmath56 , the stellar radius is @xmath57 .",
    "although the co and water emission may arise in a vertical temperature inversion region in the disk , for consistency with our limited goal for the modeling in this paper , we ignore the continuum in the modeling . the spectral line emission is therefore assumed to arise in a vertically - uniform , continuum - free layer .",
    "we also do not include an underlying continuum in fitting the line emission .",
    "the ratios of the water lines blueward of the bandhead indicates that the water emission is optically thick .",
    "very optically thick emission ( a line center optical depth of @xmath58 for the water line at @xmath59 ) is needed to reproduce the strength of the strong water lines ( e.g. , at @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) relative to the weaker lines ( e.g. , at @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows a fit to the water lines alone using a model of emission from a rotating disk .",
    "the model parameters for this fit are a temperature of 1500k and a line - of - sight column density of @xmath64 .",
    "the assumed parameters correspond to a constant line - of - sight water column density of @xmath65 over the emitting region .",
    "the emission lines are narrow , requiring a low projected disk rotational velocity @xmath52 .",
    "fitting the width of the emission requires a rotational velocity at an inner radius @xmath66 of @xmath67 when smoothed to the @xmath68 resolution of the 2-pixel nirspec slit and assuming no microturbulent broadening .",
    "the strength of the emission can be fit assuming an annular emitting region extending from an inner radius of @xmath69 to an outer radius @xmath70 .",
    "for the assumed stellar mass and the low value of @xmath52 required at the inner radius , @xmath69 corresponds to a face - on inclination of 3 degrees .",
    "the observed emission features are well fit with a topocentric velocity of @xmath71 , in good agreement with the system radial velocity ( @xmath72 ; levreault 1988 ; mcmuldroch et al .",
    "1993 ) .    we can obtain a reasonable fit to both the co and water emission using the differentially rotating disk model ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the model parameters for this fit are a radial temperature distribution @xmath73 and a line - of - sight column density that varies as @xmath74 between an inner radius of @xmath75 and an outer radius of @xmath76 .",
    "the line - of - sight rotational velocity at @xmath66 is @xmath77 and @xmath78 of gaussian microturbulent broadening is assumed throughout .",
    "the @xmath52 and the microturbulence are jointly constrained by the widths of the isolated water and co lines , the beating of the co lines immediately redward of the bandhead , and the strengths of the co lines far from the bandhead compared to the strength of the bandhead .",
    "the @xmath78 local line broadening used in the fit is in excess of the thermal dispersion of @xmath79 for co at 2500k and comparable to the sound speed at that temperature .",
    "since the relative strength of the co emission compared to the water emission is much larger than expected for a co - to - h@xmath80o abundance ratio in chemical equilibrium , the water abundance in the fit is therefore scaled down by a factor of 0.2 relative to its chemical equilibrium value . because the water emission is less optically thick in this model than in the model shown in figure 3 , the weaker water lines ( e.g. , at @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) are underfit in the model compared to figure 3 .    in the model , the co emission forms over radii @xmath83 , whereas the water emission forms at larger radii @xmath84 .",
    "since the co emission extends in to smaller disk radii ( and higher disk rotational velocities ) than the water emission , the water lines are narrower than the co lines in the synthetic spectrum , in agreement with the observations .",
    "as a caveat , we note that for a source with the properties assumed above , the sed of v1331 cyg would imply significant veiling , with an optical excess that is 1.7 times the strength of the stellar continuum .",
    "significant veiling at optical wavelengths may help to explain the lack of stellar absorption lines in the optical spectrum of this source ( chavarria 1981 ) .",
    "if v1331 cyg actually experiences little or no optical veiling , the sed would be better fit with a stellar luminosity of @xmath85 and a stellar radius of @xmath86 .",
    "in such a case @xmath66 would have to be larger , and the other disk model parameters could be modified to produce fits comparable to those shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "we could fit the water emission alone ( the equivalent of figure 3 ) by adopting a somewhat smaller disk column density of @xmath87 for a larger inner radius of @xmath88 .",
    "we could fit both the co and water emission ( the equivalent of figure 4 ) by adopting a cooler temperature distribution @xmath89 for a larger inner radius of @xmath90 .",
    "the column density adopted in the modeling is much less than that of either the minimum mass solar nebula or a steady accretion disk that accretes at a rate typical of t tauri stars .",
    "the smaller column density adopted in the modeling may result because the molecular emission arises in a temperature inversion region in the disk atmosphere rather than from the entire vertical column density of an optically thick disk .",
    "alternatively , or in addition , co and water may not be present throughout ( or sufficiently warm enough to emit over ) the entire vertical column density of the disk .",
    "the possibility of non - thermal line broadening in the disk atmosphere , as indicated by the shape of the co overtone emission , is similar to the result obtained by carr et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the young star svs-13 . in the earlier study ,",
    "the magnitude of the non - thermal local line broadening was @xmath91 for a gaussian profile , larger than both the @xmath78 used here for v1331 cyg and the line broadening found for the co bandhead emission from the herbig ae stars wl16 and 1548c27 ( najita et al .",
    "we have previously speculated that non - thermal line broadening is a consequence of turbulence in the disk atmosphere , perhaps produced by the magnetorotational instability .",
    "the strong co emission compared to water emission that we find for v1331 cyg has also been found for svs-13 ( carr et al .",
    "2004 ) and the @xmath92 source studied by thi & bik ( 2005 ) .",
    "these results have been interpreted as evidence for a reduced h@xmath80o / co abundance ratio in the disk atmosphere .",
    "a reduced h@xmath80o / co ratio is indeed found for models of strongly irradiated disks surrounding high mass stars ( thi & bik 2005 ) .",
    "an alternative interpretation might consider the possibility that the water emission is reduced in strength because it arises from a significantly narrower emitting area than we have assumed .",
    "this modeling approach has been used in fitting the ( spectrally unresolved ) rich mid - infrared molecular emission of classical t tauri stars ( carr & najita 2008 ) .",
    "the near face - on geometry of the v1331 cyg disk allows for this possibility despite the high velocity resolution of our observations .",
    "detailed theoretical studies of the thermal - chemical properties of disk atmospheres would be needed to determine whether a restricted annular emission region is a reasonable interpretation .",
    "compared to the rich emission line spectrum of v1331 cyg , the mwc 480 spectrum appears mostly featureless .",
    "the lack of obvious water emission features is perhaps surprising given the results of eisner ( 2007 ) .",
    "we can use the v1331 cyg spectrum as a `` water emission template '' to determine whether velocity broadening by disk rotation or other line broadening processes can smear out the spectral signature of water in the mwc 480 spectrum .    in eisner ( 2007 ) , the observed spectrum and spectrally dispersed visibilities were best fit with a model that included emission from ( 1 ) the star , ( 2 ) a ring of optically thick dust with a radius 0.28au and a temperature of 1200k , ( 3 ) a hot compact component that was modeled as blackbody emission from a ring with a radius @xmath93au and a temperature of 2410k , and ( 4 ) a ring of gaseous water with a radius of 0.16au , a temperature of 2300k , and a column density of @xmath94 . at @xmath95 ,",
    "these four components contribute approximately 1jy , 1.7jy , 1jy , and 0.1jy , respectively .",
    "we can consider two cases : water emission might account for both components ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) or for component ( 4 ) only .",
    "the rotational broadening of the water emission is expected to be @xmath96 based on the stellar mass of mwc480 ( @xmath3 ) , the measured inclination @xmath42638 degrees of the mwc 480 disk ( simon et al .",
    "2000 ; eisner et al .  2004 ) and the disk radius ( 0.16au ) of the water emission in the model of eisner ( 2007 ) .",
    "for the hot compact component , which had a radius @xmath97au , the expected rotational broadening is somewhat larger , @xmath98 .",
    "similar velocity widths are found for the co fundamental emission from mwc 480 , which is also believed to originate in the disk .",
    "the emission has a fwhm of @xmath99 for the @xmath100 lines and @xmath101 for the @xmath102 lines ( blake & boogert 2004 ) .    to explore the possibility of rotational broadening",
    ", we looked at order 36 , a spectral order that experiences limited telluric absorption and which is located toward the short wavelength end of the @xmath1-band where the water emission is expected to become significant .",
    "figure 5 ( top panel ) shows the ( continuum subtracted ) emission line structure in this order of the v1331 cyg spectrum , scaled in flux so that when it is smoothed to a resolution of @xmath103 ( @xmath104 ; horizontal line ) the equivalent pseudo - continuum excess is @xmath46jy , the flux of the hot compact component at @xmath95 .",
    "we also show the line emission spectrum ( boxcar ) smoothed by 36 pixels ( or @xmath105 ; red line ) , larger than the expected rotational broadening for either the water or the hot compact component .",
    "a continuum level of 2.7jy is added to the smoothed line emission spectra to bring the total average flux level up to the continuum level of 3.7jy found for mwc 480 by eisner ( 2007 ) .",
    "the middle panel of figure 5 shows the resulting spectrum ( red line ) overplotted on the observed mwc480 spectrum in order 36 ( black line ) .",
    "significantly more structure is present than in the mwc 480 spectrum .",
    "thus , rotationally broadened water emission seems unlikely to account for the flux attributed to the hot compact component in the eisner ( 2007 ) model .",
    "the bottom panel of figure 5 shows an equivalent plot for the case where the pseudo - continuum contributed by the water emission is smaller , 0.1jy , the strength of the flux attributed to component ( 4 ) in the eisner ( 2007 ) model . in this case",
    "as well , the mwc 480 spectrum shows less structure than in the model .",
    "thus , water emission seems unlikely be present at the level needed to account for the flux attributed to either the hot compact component or the water component of the eisner ( 2007 ) model .",
    "a possible caveat is that the water emission reported by eisner ( 2007 ) may be time variable .",
    "the @xmath1-band flux of mwc 480 is known to vary with time by a modest amount ( 15% ; sitko et al .",
    "2008 ; de winter et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , the strength of the @xmath1-band continuum in our spectrum is similar to that reported by eisner ( 2007 ) , which does not suggest a large spectral variation between the two epochs of observation .",
    "another possible caveat is that v1331 cyg is not a good template for the water emission in mwc 480 .",
    "the water emission in mwc 480 may be much more highly optically thick and line blanketed , involving much higher water column densities than those considered by eisner ( 2007 ) or than is present in the v1331 cyg spectrum .",
    "the model of water emission used by eisner ( 2007 ) to fit the interferometer observations of mwc480 is far from being line blanketed .",
    "it is in fact more optically thin than the water emission observed in the v1331 cyg spectrum .",
    "the model parameters used by eisner ( 2007 ) , a temperature of 2300k and a column density of @xmath94 , do a reasonable job reproducing the relative fluxes of many of the water lines in the region immediately blueward of the co overtone bandhead , with the important exception that the lines at 2.2917 and @xmath61 are factors of 23 too strong compared to the weaker water lines .",
    "this is because the water emission in the eisner ( 2007 ) model is optically thin , whereas the relative fluxes of the water lines in the v1331 cyg spectrum indicate more optically thick emission .",
    "a more detailed study of possible water emission in mwc 480 would benefit from the development of a reliable water line list for the short wavelength end of the @xmath1-band .",
    "this is a subject for future work .",
    "v1331 cyg shows a rich spectrum of water emission in the @xmath1-band . in comparison ,",
    "the @xmath1-band spectrum of mwc 480 shows little emission from water or any other spectral lines .",
    "the non - detection of water emission is consistent with the absence of co overtone emission from mwc 480 : all sources of @xmath1-band water emission reported in the literature also show co overtone emission ( carr et al .",
    "2004 ; thi & bik 2005 ; najita et al .",
    "2000 ; this paper ; see also van boekel 2007 ) .    the spectral shape of the low - resolution keck interferometric spectrum of mwc 480 ( eisner 2007 ) is consistent with the lack of water emission features in the high - resolution spectrum of mwc 480 .",
    "one difference between the low - resolution spectrum of mwc 480 and the spectrum of a source like svs-13 , which is known to show strong water emission , is that at low spectral resolution svs-13 shows an upturn in the continuum at both the long- and short - wavelength ends of the @xmath1-band .",
    "the spectral shape is interpreted as a signature of water emission from the @xmath106 and @xmath107 water bands ( carr et al .",
    "in contrast , the spectrum of mwc 480 shows a significant excess over the continuum at the short wavelength end , while the long - wavelength spectrum is consistent with continuum emission only . to fit the data , eisner ( 2007 ) used hot ( 2300k ) water emission , which produces relatively more flux at the short - wavelength end of the @xmath1-band than would cooler material .",
    "although mwc 480 shows neither co overtone nor water emission , there is evidence for disk gas inward of the dust sublimation radius , as would be expected for a source with a significant outer disk ( @xmath108 ; mannings & sargent 1997 ; hamidouche , looney , & mundy 2006 ) that is believed to be accreting ( sitko et al .",
    "the high-@xmath109 co fundamental emission from mwc 480 has line wings extending to @xmath110 ( blake & boogert 2004 ) . at an inclination of @xmath111 and a stellar mass of @xmath3 ,",
    "this implies that the co fundamental emission extends to within @xmath112au for keplerian rotation , well within the dust sublimation radius of @xmath113au ( eisner 2007 ) .",
    "while there is clearly gas within the dust sublimation radius of mwc 480 , the co and water column densities and/or the temperature there are perhaps too low to produce co overtone or water emission .",
    "the presence of co fundamental emission , accompanied by the absence of co overtone and @xmath1-band water emission , is the situation commonly found for classical t tauri stars .",
    "co fundamental emission is detected from nearly all accreting t tauri stars studied ( najita et al .",
    "2003 ) , whereas co overtone and @xmath1-band water emission are restricted to the high accretion rate systems ( najita et al .",
    "2000 , 2007 ) .",
    "co overtone emission is also rare among high mass stars ( hanson et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "in contrast , models of gaseous inner disks that assume lte molecular abundances and include nir opacity sources such as water , co , and h@xmath114 predict prominent near - infrared spectral structure from herbig ae disks . in muzerolle",
    "et al .  ( 2004 ) , a dust - free gaseous inner disk is found to be capable of producing a significant @xmath1-band flux . at a nominal taurus distance of 140pc",
    ", an excess of @xmath46jy in the @xmath1-band , the flux of the hot compact continuum in mwc 480 , can be produced in disks with accretion rates of @xmath115 .",
    "although such a model can plausibly account for the magnitude of the compact excess that is observed in mwc 480 , the excess is also predicted to show strong @xmath1-band emission features of co and water , which are not observed .",
    "the models further predict prominent co and water features over a wide range in accretion rate ( @xmath116 ; muzerolle et al .",
    "2004 ; calvet et al .",
    "emission is predicted at lower accretion rates and absorption at higher accretion rates .",
    "the relative rarity of co overtone and water features ( in emission or absorption ) from herbig ae stars suggests that something is missing from the assumed physical - thermal - chemical structure of the disk in these models .",
    "possibilities include non - lte abundances , photodissociation , and missing sources of continuum opacity and ionization .",
    "if water emission does not appear to be responsible for the excess detected inward of the dust sublimation radius in mwc 480 , what is the origin of the excess ?",
    "the lack of molecular emission might be explained by the presence of a competing source of continuum opacity that produces the hot compact excess .",
    "possible additional opacity sources are high temperature condensates , h@xmath114 , and free - free emission .",
    "materials such as corundum ( al@xmath80o@xmath117 ) , hibonite ( caal@xmath118o@xmath119 ) , perovskite ( catio@xmath117 ) , and gehlenite ( ca@xmath80al@xmath80sio@xmath120 ) are found in ci chondrites and have high sublimation temperatures of 16401800 k ( posch et al .  2007 ) .",
    "however , they have poor @xmath1-band emission efficiencies @xmath121 ( henning et al .   1991 ; also b. sargent , personal communication ) , which makes it less likely that they will contribute significantly to the @xmath1-band opacity .",
    "graphite grains , often invoked to explain the 2175  bump in the interstellar extinction curve , also have a high sublimation temperature ( @xmath122k ) at interstellar pressures ( krugel 2003 ; salpeter 1977 ) .",
    "however , graphite may be destroyed by processes such as chemisputtering at much lower temperatures @xmath123k ( lenzuni , gail , & henning 1995 ; duschl , gail , & tscharnuter 1996 ) .",
    "so it is unclear whether it can explain the observed hot , compact excess in mwc 480 .",
    "another possibility is that solids disappear through sublimation over a finite range in temperature ( and disk radius ) .",
    "for example , in considering the balance between the solid and gas phases for magnesium - iron silicates , duschl et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that the gas and dust phases coexist over a range in temperature , with a fraction of silicates surviving to temperatures @xmath124k at the densities of the inner disk region ( @xmath125au ) .",
    "aluminum - calcium - silicates may be sustained to somewhat higher temperatures .",
    "detailed modeling of this kind may be needed to understand the conditions under which dust grains may contribute a modest residual continuum opacity in the high temperature inner regions of disks .",
    "a significant free - free continuum flux requires a significant electron abundance in the inner disk . for optically thin free - free emission from a @xmath126k gas in a cylindrical volume that is @xmath127au in radius and @xmath128 in height",
    ", an electron density of @xmath129 is needed to produce a continuum flux of @xmath46jy at a distance of 140  pc . in comparison , for a steady accretion disk accreting at the rate @xmath130 , the disk column density is @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the viscosity parameter , and @xmath133 is the sound speed .",
    "the quantity @xmath134 is the disk scale height , where @xmath135 is the keplerian angular velocity .",
    "the average disk density can be estimated as @xmath136 for an accretion rate of @xmath137 a stellar mass @xmath138 , and a viscosity parameter @xmath139 . comparing these densities , we require a high average electron fraction in the disk @xmath140 in order to produce a @xmath46jy free - free continuum flux from a disk accreting at @xmath141 .",
    "continuum opacity from h@xmath114 is another possibility . at a column density @xmath142 and temperature @xmath143k , the h@xmath114 continuum optical depth @xmath144 in chemical equilibrium ( e.g. , najita et al .  1996 ) .",
    "such warm temperatures are expected for inner disks with accretion rates @xmath145 ; the midplane h@xmath114 opacity is expected to become significant under these conditions ( muzerolle et al .",
    "the possibility of a high h@xmath114 opacity at a column density @xmath142 is also noted by thi & bik ( 2005 ) .",
    "further studies of the gas temperature , electron fraction , and h@xmath114 abundance expected for the specific conditions in the inner region of the mwc 480 disk would be useful to sort out these possibilities .",
    "several recent interferometric studies have reported evidence for a bright compact source of near - infrared emission interior to the dust sublimation radius in herbig aebe stars ( eisner 2007 ; eisner et al .  2007 ; kraus et al",

    "such a gaseous disk is expected to show significant spectral structure ( e.g. , muzerolle et al .",
    "2004 ; eisner 2007 ) .",
    "our study of mwc 480 does not reveal any significant spectral structure in the @xmath1-band spectrum of the source , suggesting that the compact excess is produced by a continuum process ( e.g. , high temperature condensates , h@xmath114 , or free - free emission ) rather than by line emission . it would be interesting to carry out similar studies for other sources with compact continuum excesses in order to determine if the results obtained here for mwc 480 apply more broadly to other sources with compact continuum excesses .    given its narrow emission lines , v1331 cyg is a good template for warm water emission from a circumstellar disk .",
