    "the gross shape of quasars seds is characterized by two major features ; the big blue bump shortward of 0.3 @xmath3 and the infrared bump between 2 and 200 @xmath7 m ( sanders et al .",
    "@xcite ; elvis et al .",
    "it is generally considered that the blue bump is dominated by thermal emission from an accretion disk .",
    "the infrared bump is ubiquitous in both radio - quiet and radio - loud quasars .",
    "the infrared emission in radio - loud quasars has generally been taken to be dominated by non - thermal emission ( e.g. , impey & neugebauer @xcite ; bloom et al .",
    "@xcite ; neugebauer & matthews @xcite )",
    ".    the origin of the infrared emission in radio quiet quasars is generally attributed to thermal emission from heated dust .",
    "the rise from 1 @xmath7 m minimum toward 3 @xmath7 m , which is universally present in quasars , is naturally explained by the sublimation of dust grains at @xmath4 1,500 k ( e.g. , kobayashi et al .",
    "this is expected from the current unified models of active galactic nuclei , which have a dusty obscuring torus around a central source .",
    "pier & krolik ( @xcite ) computed the infrared properties predicted for the dust obscuring tori surrounding central sources by modeling free parameters of the inner radius of the torus to its thickness , the thomson depths constraining the outer radius of the torus , and the flux of the nuclear radiation .",
    "the infrared emission in 1 - 10 @xmath7 m of pg quasars is well explained by their models , while the emission in the far - infrared is much greater than that predicted .",
    "several models were proposed to account for the far - infrared emission of quasars ; these are ( 1)warm dust in a distorted disk extending from 0.1kpc to more than 1kpc , which is heated directly by radiation from central source ( sanders et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ( 2)dust clouds in the narrow line region heated by the radiation from the central sources and star - forming regions ( rowan - robinson @xcite ) , and ( 3)dust in the obscuring tori extending to 200 - 3kpc ( andreani et al .",
    "however , it should be noted that temporal variations of 10 @xmath7 m brightness of radio - quiet quasar pg 1535 + 547 found by neugebauer & matthews ( @xcite ) casts doubt on the thermal origin of the infrared emission in radio - quiet quasars .",

    "the ratio of uv fe@xmath12/mg@xmath12 of b 1422 + 231 at @xmath13 shows the the host galaxy was already in the late - evolutionary phase of the fe enrichment by sne ia at z = 3.6 ( kawara et al .",
    "@xcite ; yoshii et al .",
    "@xcite ) . these all suggest that the central part of host galaxies formed rapidly at very high - redshift @xmath14 , and metallicity enrichment in the central part was already completed at @xmath15 .",

    "iso far - infrared surveys ( kawara et al .",
    "@xcite ; puget et al .",
    "@xcite ) clearly indicate that the sky seen in the far - infrared has a clumpy structure which is made up of ir cirrus and extragalactic sources .",
    "this structure rotates with time relative to the iso coordinate system due to the field rotation , increasing the probability of fault detection if the chopping mode is used .",

    "@xcite ) , starting at the edited raw data ( erd ) created via the off - line processing version 7.0 .",
    "the aot / batch processing mode of pia is used with the default parameters to reduce erd to the astronomical analysis processing ( aap ) level .",
    "this standard reduction includes linearization and deglitching of integration ramps on the erd level , signal deglitching and drift recognition on the srd ( signal per ramp data ) level , reset interval normalization , signal deglitching , dark current subtraction , signal linearization , and vignetting correction on the scp(signal per chopper plateau data ) level .",
    "the responsivity calibration was made on the spd ( standard processed data ) level by using the second measurement of the internal fine calibration source 1(fcs1 ) which is calibrated against celestial standards .",
    "the correction for the transient behavior of the detectors was applied to point sources ( quasars ) on this level .",
    "images were produced on the aap ( astronomical analysis processing ) in the mapping mode with median brightness values .",
    "the correction for drift in the responsivity is not important to our observations , and so this correction was not made . to check the importance of the drift ,",

    "( @xcite ) show that this is a powerful tool to correct for drift in the detector responsivity .",
    "however , unlike large aap maps in the lockman hole , the median filter technique does not improve our aap maps .",
    "this is attributed to the size of our aap maps ; the observing time of these small maps is shorter than the timescale of drift in the detector responsibility , and so impact by the drift is small .",
    "in fact , every detector pixel of the c100 and c200 detector arrays has been checked for signal , and neither spike noise nor drift in the responsibility was found .",
    "maps with all the detector pixels always give better results than those obtained by masking some of the detector pixels .",
    "in addition , it was confirmed that there were no significant differences between two aap maps produced by two different algorithms on the aap level , namely , the full coverage and distance weighting algorithms .",

    "aperture photometry was then performed using iraf and skyview in the manner similar to isocam .",
    "the original pixel sizes of aap maps are equal to the raster steps .",
    "because these are too large to center the aperture on the quasar with sufficient accuracy , aap maps were rebinned in such a way that each original pixel is converted into @xmath44 sub - pixels .",
    "two apertures centered on the object were used ; the small one has a diameter of @xmath45 , the airy diameter as given in table [ tab2 ] , and the other has a diameter of @xmath42 .",
    "the photometry was corrected for loss of flux in the psf ( point spread function ) wings by computing the same psf model as used for isocam .",
    "the factor of the psf correction is 0.63 except for pc 1548 + 4632 and pc 1640 + 4628 .",
    "these two quasars were centered between four pixels in such a way that quasars illuminate the four pixels equally .",
    "consequently the loss of flux measured with the two apertures is large , and the factor of the psf correction is 0.27 for c_90 and 0.23 for c_160 .",
    "the results after these corrections are given in table [ tab3 ] with statistical errors . the errors in the absolute photometric calibration are not included in table [ tab3 ] ;",

    "<S> eight luminous quasars with @xmath0 at z = 1.4 - 3.7 have been observed in the mid- and far - infrared using iso . </S>",

    "<S> seds ( spectral energy distributions ) from the uv to far - infrared have been obtained while supplementing iso observations with photometry in the optical and near - infrared made from the ground within 17 months . </S>",
    "<S> the seds are compared with the med ( mean spectral energy distributions ) of low - redshift quasars with @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that our far - infrared observations were limited by confusion noise due to crowded sources . </S>"
