    "since first experimental realizations of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite the condensates have been subject to intensive experimental and theoretical research .",
    "the condensates are relatively easy to manipulate and a rich variety of phenomena can be studied in a well controlled way .",
    "one example is a dark soliton in analogy to nonlinear optics @xcite .",
    "the dark soliton is a place in a quasi one dimensional condensate where a condensate wave function @xmath0 changes its sign .",
    "its wave function has a notch where density of the condensate is zero .",
    "this notch appears as a dark spot on a bright cigar shaped image of a condensate .",
    "dark solitons were realized in the experiment of the hannover group @xcite and their 3 dimensional analogs were realized in ref .",

    "a wave function of the dark soliton is proportional to    @xmath1 \\ ; , \\label{tanh}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is a local value of the healing length at the position @xmath3 of the soliton .",
    "the density of coherent atoms in the notch at @xmath4 is zero .",
    "this creates a hole that might be filled up with incoherent atoms .",
    "given that interactions between atoms are repulsive , depletion of atoms from the condensate to the notch is energetically favourable .",
    "condensate with a soliton at @xmath5 has an antisymmetric wavefunction of @xmath6 .",
    "this means that all @xmath7 atoms are in the same antisymmetric single particle state .",
    "the antisymmetry of the condensate wavefunction is preserved by evolution according to the gross - pitaevskii equation .",
    "however , the full @xmath7-body hamiltonian depletes pairs of atoms from the antisymmetric condensate wavefunction to symmetric modes of the trap .",
    "this two atom process does not change the symmetry of the @xmath7-body state .",
    "the symmetric modes have nonzero density in the soliton notch at @xmath8 .",
    "simply because the condensate density is zero at @xmath8 , the @xmath8 is where we can clearly see the incoherent atoms . in our previous paper @xcite we studied a toy model of the dark soliton .",
    "we truncated single particle hilbert space to 3 lowest modes of a one dimensional harmonic trap .",
    "this is a self - consistent approximation for small @xmath7 .",
    "we have shown that a state where all atoms are condensed in the same antisymmetric wave function is not a stationary state of a quantum hamiltonian .",
    "atoms are gradually depleted from the antisymmetric condensate wave function and fill its notch . in this paper",
    "we reach similar conclusions in the opposite regime of very large @xmath7 which is relevant for the hannover experiment @xcite .",
    "we use as a tool the bogoliubov theory with noninteracting quasiparticles .    in the bogoliubov theory",
    "one considers small fluctuations around a stationary condensate background . in a uniform condensate",
    "the soliton ( [ tanh ] ) has a translational mode @xmath9 $ ] with zero frequency .",
    "the same soliton in an nonuniform condensate in a harmonic trap has an anomalous mode with negative frequency equal to @xmath10 times the trap frequency @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the nonuniformity breaks the translational invariance , moving the soliton away from the maximal density in the center of the trap lowers its energy .",
    "we will see that the anomalous mode is responsible for depletion of atoms from a condensate to the soliton notch .",
    "depletion in the bogoliubov vacuum has been recently studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , we argue that depletion in the bogoliubov vacuum analyzed in ref .  @xcite is not experimentally relevant .",
    "we construct a quantum state with minimal depletion which approximates the state of the system right after creation of the dark soliton by phase imprinting @xcite .",
    "time evolution of such a state is responsible for greying of the dark soliton .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it is suggested that deviations from the mean field description of the dark soliton observed experimentally @xcite can be explained by dissipation due to collisions of the condensate with a thermal cloud of noncondensed atoms .",
    "there is no doubt that dissipation influences dynamics of the soliton in that experiment .",
    "however , we show that the dark soliton is greying even in the absence of any thermal cloud or even in 1d where the cloud decouples from the soliton @xcite .",
    "the notch fills up with incoherent atoms quantum depleted from a condensate .",
    "our calculations , which are idealized with respect to the experiment , give a greying time of @xmath12 , which is consistent with the experimental observation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives several definitions and approximate formulas valid in the thomas - fermi regime of strong interactions .",
    "section iii gives thomas - fermi approximate analytic expressions for the frequency and the eigenfunctions of the anomalous mode .",
    "in section iv we work out a general expression for a time - dependent number of atoms depleted in the anomalous mode . in section v the number of depleted atoms is calculated in the bogoliubov vacuum of the anomalous mode . in section",
    "vi we construct a quantum state with minimal depletion which approximates the state of the system right after creation of the dark soliton . in section vii",
    "we follow time evolution of the number and density of depleted atoms , and estimate the greying time after which the notch fills up with incoherent atoms .",
    "section viii contains discussion and conclusions .",
    "in dimensionless oscillator units a gross - pitaevskii equation @xcite for the condensate wave function @xmath13 in a harmonic trap is    @xmath14    @xmath13 is normalized to @xmath15 .",

    "the lowest antisymmetric stationary state of the gross - pitaevskii equation @xmath23 is a dark soliton localized in the center of the trap . in the thomas - fermi regime @xmath24 can be approximated by the ansatz    @xmath25    here    @xmath26    is a healing length of the condensate at the condensate peak density in the center of the trap .",
    "the soliton solution in eq.([phi1 ] ) has a notch at @xmath8 .",
    "we note that with increasing @xmath27 the thomas - fermi radius @xmath28 is growing while the healing length @xmath29 tends to zero .",
    "for @xmath30 the width of the soliton is very small as compared to the size of the condensate , @xmath31 .",
    "bogoliubov equations @xcite for small perturbations on the dark soliton background are    @xmath32    here @xmath33 .",
    "we introduce two functions @xmath34 and combine eqs.([uv ] ) into    @xmath35    eqs.([p],[m ] ) have a solution with negative @xmath36 @xcite , the so called anomalous mode . in the thomas - fermi regime @xmath36",
    "can be approximated by @xcite    @xmath37    i.e. @xmath10 times the frequency of the harmonic trap .",
    "this thomas - fermi value of @xmath36 follows from effective equations of motion for a position of a dark soliton in ref.@xcite , and from a perturbative @xmath38 treatment of the bogoliubov equations @xcite .",
    "the anomalous mode is a perturbative approximation to the motion of the dark soliton with respect to the background condensate . in the limit of @xmath39 the thomas - fermi radius of the condensate ( [ r ] )",
    "is growing to infinity and at the same time the healing length ( [ l0 ] ) is shrinking to @xmath40 . in this limit",
    "the condensate is uniform on the lengthscale of the soliton width and the anomalous mode of eqs.([p],[m ] ) becomes    @xmath41    this @xmath42 is simply a translational mode of the soliton in an almost uniform condensate .",

    "as @xmath49 the first term on the left hand side is small as compared to the second term and can be neglected .",
    "the second term is localized on a healing length around @xmath8 and the slow factor @xmath44 in this term can be replaced by @xmath50 .",
    "finally we can use the @xmath30 formulas in eqs.([phi0],[phi1 ] ) to get    @xmath51 \\alpha\\phi_0 ^ 3(0)\\;=\\ ; \\frac{\\omega}{\\cosh^2\\left(x / l_0\\right ) } \\;.\\ ] ]    this equation is satisfied by    @xmath52    which defines the leading term in @xmath43 . after normalization , so that @xmath53 , we get    @xmath54    we note that @xmath42 is localized within the notch of the dark soliton ( [ phi1 ] ) .",
    "we will argue that depletion of atoms from the condensate fills up the notch in the condensate wave function ( [ phi1 ] ) with incoherent atoms .",
    "this effect will appear experimentally as greying of the dark soliton .",
    "solution of the equations ( [ uv ] ) reveals many different modes corresponding to the bogoliubov spectrum .",
    "however , according to the numerical results in ref.@xcite , only the anomalous mode has a wave function localized in the soliton notch @xcite , compare eq.([fp ] ) .",
    "from all the modes the anomalous mode will contribute the most to the density of incoherent atoms filling the notch .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by numerical calculations of incoherent atoms density distribution in the bogoliubov vacuum state @xcite , where the density , which is strongly peaked in the notch , is dominated by a contribution from the anomalous mode . in the following",
    "we truncate the bogoliubov spectrum to the anomalous mode alone .",

    "for a condensate in a ground state like in eq.([phi0 ] ) the bogoliubov spectrum has only positive frequencies ( i.e. there are no anomalous modes ) .",
    "the state with no quasiparticles , the bogoliubov vacuum , is the ground state of the bogoliubov hamiltonian . in the absence of any anomalous modes it is natural to calculate the depletion in the bogoliubov vacuum  the @xmath63 state of thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "following the numerical calculation in ref.@xcite we calculate analytically for @xmath30 a number of depleted atoms in the vacuum state of the anomalous mode i.e. the state @xmath64 annihilated by @xmath65 , @xmath66 .",
    "this vacuum state is an eigenstate of the bogoliubov hamiltonian ( [ hb ] ) so the number is stationary    @xmath67    and scales with @xmath27 as @xmath68 .",
    "we compare the density of depleted atoms in the soliton notch    @xmath69    ( where @xmath7 is the total number of atoms in the system ) to the density of atoms in the condensate    @xmath70    we see that , for a sufficiently large total number of atoms @xmath7 the density of incoherent atoms in the notch will exceed the density of the background condensate . the notch will not be visible .",
    "when the density of depleted atoms is comparable to the density of the condensate one can not neglect interactions between quasiparticles .",
    "however , because of the potential instability which shows up in the negative frequency of the anomalous mode , we qualitatively expect that , unlike in more common situations where all bogolubov frequencies are positive , collisions between quasiparticles will not suppress depletion .",
    "in fig.1 we show condensate and total density plots in the bogolubov vacuum for the parameters of the hannover experiment @xcite ( @xmath71 @xmath72rb atoms in the harmonic trap with @xmath73s@xmath74 and @xmath75s@xmath74 ; @xmath76 @xcite ) .",

    "it is possible to construct a state with a very small depletion as compared to the depletion in the state @xmath64 , see the next section .",
    "solitons are excited experimentally employing a phase imprinting method @xcite .",
    "we assume that before the phase imprinting the system of @xmath7 atoms is in its ground state .",

    "the ground state is very close to a perfect condensate with _ all _ atoms in the condensate wave function ( [ phi0 ] ) .",
    "we approximate the initial condensate by a perfect condensate without any depletion .    for a perfect initial condensate",
    "the phase imprinting can be thought of as a nearly instantaneous operation on the condensate wave function .",

    "the initial dark soliton is a ( nearly ) perfect condensate with the wave function ( [ phi1 ] ) . in the hannover experiment @xcite they create moving grey solitons while here , for the sake of simplicity , we assume a stationary dark soliton . we think that in spite of this , qualitative comparison with the experiment is still possible .",

    "this vacuum is different from the bogoliubov vacuum @xmath64 ,    @xmath94    in this optimal state @xmath91 the initial number of depleted atoms in the soliton notch scales with the number of atoms as @xmath95 .",

    "we show that for a realistic value of the scattering length and other parameters the minimal density of incoherent atoms in the notch is around @xmath98 of the peak density of the surrounding condensate .",
    "our minimal depletion state is a very accurate approximation to the initial perfect condensate with a dark soliton .",
    "as both coherent and incoherent densities grow with @xmath7 in the same way , compare eqs.([dbec],[db ] ) , the quality of this approximation does not change with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "the negligible depletion in the minimal depletion state justifies _ a posteriori _ our truncation of the theory to the anomalous mode .",
    "moreover , close to the initial minimal depletion state @xmath91 we can safely use the noninteracting bogoliubov theory .",
    "this theory assumes that the density of incoherent atoms is small as compared to the density of the condensate .",
    "in contrast , for large @xmath7 the bogoliubov vacuum @xmath64 does not satisfy this assumption .",
    "the initial density of incoherent atoms in the notch ( calculated in the @xmath91 state ) is negligible , see fig.2 .",
    "the initial dark soliton is very dark .",
    "this small depletion is not stationary because the initial minimal depletion state @xmath91 is not an eigenstate of the bogoliubov hamiltonian ( [ hb ] ) . from eqs .",
    "( [ dn],[bop ] ) one can easily deduce time evolution of the number of depleted atoms    @xmath99    the coefficient in front of the @xmath100 function scales with the total number of atoms as @xmath101 which implies that the maximal density of depleted atoms in the soliton notch    @xmath102    hence , for large enough @xmath7 the density of depleted atoms in the soliton notch will reach the density of the condensate ( [ dbec ] ) before it reaches the maximum ( [ max ] ) at @xmath103 .",
    "eq.([dn(t ) ] ) might suggest that the system will go through a series of periodic revivals of the initial state @xmath91 with a period of @xmath104 .",
    "this is not a correct conclusion for large @xmath7 . after a greying time",
    "@xmath105    when the density of incoherent atoms in the notch and the density of the condensate become comparable for the first time , we can not use the noninteracting bogoliubov theory any more @xcite .",
    "after @xmath106 one can ignore neither anharmonicity in the hamiltonian ( [ hb ] ) of the anomalous mode nor interaction of the anomalous mode with other bogoliubov modes ( phonons ) .",
    "we expect that these nonlinearities lead to fast dephasing and prevent any revivals .",
    "the number of depleted atoms in the notch initially follows eq.([dn(t ) ] ) until at around the greying time @xmath106 their density saturates at a density comparable to the density of the condensate .",
    "this will appear as greying of the dark soliton .",
    "the nonlinear stage deserves more quantitative analysis .",
    "however , we expect that , because of the global instability that shows in the negative frequency of the anomalous mode , the nonlinearities will not suppress depletion .    eq.([tgl ] ) gives a crude upper estimate of @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "given eq.([omega ] ) we obtain in real time units    @xmath108    here @xmath11 is an axial trap frequency . in the hannover experiment of ref.@xcite , @xmath109ms while the density of the incoherent atoms at the soliton notch becomes [ according to eq .",
    "( [ dn(t ) ] ) ] comparable to the condensate density after @xmath110ms , see fig .  [ deplb ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare solitons to vortices .",
    "there are toy model calculations in ref.@xcite for small @xmath7 that show some incoherent atoms in the vortex core .",
    "the mechanism is similar to solitons : @xmath111 atoms in the state with angular momentum @xmath112 are depleted to states @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "@xmath113 gives nonzero density in the core .",
    "depletion to an empty core / notch is not limited to solitons .",
    "in contrast to solitons created by phase imprinting , ens vortices are created by gradual evaporative cooling to a ground state of a rotating trap @xcite .",
    "this ground state has no negative frequency anomalous mode @xcite .",
    "this vortex ground state is stationary and has stationary depletion in the core .    in conclusion , we analyze greying of a dark soliton due to depletion in the anomalous mode of the bogoliubov theory . we give approximate analytic expressions for @xmath115 and @xmath116 of the anomalous mode valid in the thomas - fermi regime .",
    "these expressions are used to work out formulas for a time - dependent number of atoms depleted to the notch .",
    "we argue that , contrary to the assumption in ref.@xcite , the vacuum of the anomalous mode is far from an optimal approximation to a condensate with a dark soliton .",
    "there is a much better state which minimizes depletion from the condensate .",
    "we argue that this minimal depletion state can serve as a rough approximation to the state of the system right after creation of the soliton by the phase imprinting method .",
