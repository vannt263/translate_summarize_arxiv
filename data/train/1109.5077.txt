    "the polymer would be linearly stretched , yielding @xmath128 intrinsic contacts , and incorporated in a channel with a triangular cross section such that every monomer is in optimal distance to two square patches of the membrane , resulting in a number of six polymer - membrane contacts per monomer .",
    "obviously , this idealized situation is not reached here but from the tendencies shown in fig .",
    "[ plot : mf1_lowt_n ] we propose embedded elongated conformations ( ) as predominant states for low temperature and high polymer - membrane interaction strength . in the range of @xmath114 the two contact numbers",
    "seem to converge to certain intermediate values .",
    "although we are not sure which would be the perfect symmetry in this case , we expect to find the embedded compact phase as the low - temperature phase here as suggested by the snapshot in fig .",
    "[ fig : conf_mf1](e ) .",
    "the transition out of the phase with increasing temperature is analyzed in figs .",
    "[ plot : mf1_mc - g_rgrat][plot : mf1_mc - ac1_dtrgxy ] . in the range of @xmath129 ,",
    "the perpendicular component of the gyration tensor significantly increases in the region @xmath130 as indicated by the peaks in the corresponding temperature derivative ( fig .",
    "[ plot : mf1_mc - g_dtrgz ] ) . additionally , we observe a slight increase in the sphericity aspect ratio as depicted in fig .",
    "[ plot : mf1_mc - g_rgrat ] meaning that conformations change from oblate to more spherical shapes .",
    "this marks the transition from embedded compact ( ) to globular ( ) conformations which qualitatively compares to the droplet ",
    "globule transition (    ) in the stiff membrane case .        for higher polymer - membrane interaction strengths , @xmath131",
    ", we observe a peak in the temperature derivative of the parallel component of the gyration tensor in the region @xmath132 ( fig .",
    "[ plot : mf1_mc - ac1_dtrgxy ] ) . as the perpendicular component does not increase simultaneously , this indicates a further `` flattening '' of the polymer structures .",
    "this can also be concluded from the drop in the sphericity aspect ratio ( fig .",
    "[ plot : mf1_mc - g_rgrat ] ) . together with the observed drop in the number of intrinsic contacts ( fig .",
    "[ plot : mf1_lowt_n ] ) , we identify the transition from the embedded compact ( ) to the adsorbed compact ( ) phase here .",
    "+     one of the strongest transition signals we find is shown in fig .",
    "[ plot : mf1_me - ac1 ] .",
    "the temperature derivatives of the radius of gyration and the number of polymer - membrane contacts exhibit a deep valley indicating a sharp transition line .",
    "the position of the valley increases from @xmath133 at @xmath134 to @xmath124 at @xmath135 almost linearly .",
    "the decrease in the radius of gyration suggests that we have a transition from expanded ( or elongated ) structures at lower temperature to more compact structures at higher temperature .",
    "this is exactly the opposite of what we usually observe in transitions like the @xmath98 collapse and would not be possible without the membrane serving as an agent or a medium enhancing the probability of elongated conformations in the low - temperature phase .",
    "looking also at the mean number of polymer - membrane contacts per monomer ( fig .",
    "[ plot : mf1_lowt_n ] ) , we see that the `` inverse collapse '' is accompanied by a drop from more than four to slightly less than four contacts per monomer , which was the maximum value for a stiff membrane .",
    "this suggests that the membrane adapts its shape to the polymer to form up to six contacts with each monomer in the low - temperature phase and gives up this behavior at higher temperatures after passing the transition .",
    "taken together , we observe a transition form elongated conformations of the polymer which are partially incorporated into the membrane ( ) to disk - like compact film structures adsorbed to the fluctuating membrane surface ( ) .",
    "+     for higher temperatures we observe another , but much weaker , transition signal in the temperature derivative of the radius of gyration . taking a closer look at the temperature derivatives of the individual components of the gyration tensor ( fig .",
    "[ plot : mf1_ac1-ae ] ) , we find a similar behavior to what we have seen already in the stiff membrane system .",
    "the perpendicular component increases at a transition line ranging from @xmath136 at @xmath134 to @xmath137 at @xmath135 indicating a ( partial ) desorption of the polymer from the membrane surface .",
    "additionally , the parallel component increases along a transition line from @xmath138 at @xmath139 to @xmath140 at @xmath135 , indicating an expansion of the polymer parallel to the membrane surface . as in the stiff membrane case , we conclude that what we observe here is the transition from disk - like compact film structures adsorbed to the membrane surface ( ) to expanded random coil structures , partially adsorbed to the membrane surface ( ) . for high polymer - membrane interaction strengths , we think that additionally ( almost ) completely adsorbed random coil conformations ( ) appear in between .    in the region of the phase diagram where the phases , , , and meet , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , many transitions seem to superimpose .",
    "therefore , it can not be clearly decided what structures are predominantly present in that region . as this is a finite - size effect",
    ", we think that investigations on larger systems could reveal more about the actual phase structure here .",
    "in this paper we have studied the structural behavior of a coarse - grained model system consisting of a single elastic , flexible polymer in contact with a flexible membrane .",
    "the main goal was to identify the conformational thermodynamic pseudophases of the system in dependence of temperature and polymer - membrane interaction strength as external parameters . to clearly point out the effects emerging from the flexibility and adaptivity of the membrane",
    ", we separately investigated the two cases of a stiff membrane forced into a flat state and a flexible membrane , both with the polymer grafted .",
    "the pseudophase diagrams were constructed from the measured observables and their fluctuations for an intermediate - sized system of polymer length @xmath82 and membrane size @xmath143 .",
    "the observed conformational pseudophases include the following :    * desorbed conformations for low polymer - membrane interaction strengths .",
    "these phases are well - known from studies of free polymers . with decreasing temperature",
    "the polymer undergoes two transitions , the @xmath98 transition from extended random coil structures ( ) to more compact but disordered globular conformations ( ) and the freezing transition to a highly compact icosahedral ground state ( ) .",
    "* adsorbed disordered conformations in both systems . in these conformations",
    "the polymer is adsorbed to the membrane surface but still highly disordered such that the presence or absence of membrane fluctuations does not induce qualitative differences .",
    "we distinguish between ( almost ) completely adsorbed , extended ( ) and partially adsorbed , extended ( ) random coil structures .",
    "* adsorbed well - ordered conformations in the stiff membrane system . for low temperatures ,",
    "we observed highly ordered conformations adsorbed to the membrane surface .",
    "we distinguish between disk - shaped compact film structures ( ) and semi - spherical droplets ( ) .",
    "* embedded conformations in the flexible membrane system . at low temperatures , we found the membrane adapting its structure such that it partially incorporates the polymer .",
    "compact oblate - shaped structures embedded into the membrane ( ) were observed at intermediate and linearly stretched embedded structures ( ) were identified at high interaction strength .",
    "because of its smallness , the system s structural behavior is influenced by finite - size effects .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that the phase behavior of the system remains qualitatively intact also for larger systems .",
    "a verification by a systematic finite - size analysis is currently unachievable for most of the phases , in particular in the low - temperature regime .",
    "thus , this remains future work in its own right .",
    "however , also the finite - size effects are of substantial interest since classes of polymers , such as proteins , are naturally finite .",
