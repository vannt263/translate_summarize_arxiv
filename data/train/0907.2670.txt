    "quantum lattice models governed by local hamiltonians exhibit a wealth of phases that sometimes escapes the local group analysis of symmetries underlying landau s paradigm for second order phase transitions .",
    "topological phases @xcite are a remarkable instance of such exotic behaviour , where the effective field theory controlling the long - distance properties is a topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) @xcite .",
    "such phases arise in the fractional quantum hall effect ( and also in @xmath0-wave superconductors ) , but they also find explicit realisation in a number of lattice models , intensely studied both for their theoretical properties and because of the proposal by kitaev @xcite that they would make intrinsically fault - tolerant quantum memories and computers .    among these lattice models ,",
    "the class of quantum double ( qd ) models , corresponding to discrete lattice gauge theories , was introduced as candidates for quantum memories and computers in @xcite .",
    "the more comprehensive class of string - net ( sn ) models was defined in @xcite .",
    "these models have a characteristic form of frustration - free hamiltonian as a sum of mutually commuting projectors .",
    "it is these two classes of models that we will deal with in this paper . on the other hand ,",
    "interesting models with more intricate hamiltonians have been proposed : let us mention the extended hubbard model @xcite ; kitaev s honeycomb model @xcite , featuring two - body interactions ; colour codes @xcite , and generalised quantum doubles @xcite .",
    "the study of topological order brings together many abstract mathematical concepts , from fields ranging from quantum groups to category theory , yet the simplest topological lattice models offer a very direct physical bridge to these concepts . for instance , the representation theory of quasitriangular hopf algebras governs the classification of excitations in qd models ( to be discussed in section [ sec : qdoubles ] ) , and fusion categories are the starting point for sn models .",
    "it is desirable to understand the interrelations among different lattice constructions of systems with topological order .",
    "as argued in @xcite , two - dimensional sn models encompass all _ doubled _ topological phases , and it is understood that the discrete gauge theory phases described by qd models should be contained in the class of sn models . in section [ sec : mappingqd ] , we show how this happens and identify quantum doubles with a subclass of string - net models ( a construction , to the best of our knowledge , not so far made explicit in the literature ) . in more abstract terms , this is an example of morita equivalence ( the origin of this concept can be found in @xcite ; see , e.  g. , @xcite ) , whereby the local degrees of freedom in the lattice may be seen as objects in a category , and the physical excitations , equivalent in both cases , correspond to a representation category .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : we briefly introduce the quantum double models in section [ sec : qdoubles ] , and the string - net models in section [ sec : stringnets ] .",
    "the mapping @xmath1 is discussed in section [ sec : mappingqd ] , and in section [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions , and a preview of work in progress concerning generalisations of this construction .",
    "quantum double lattice models are a direct translation into the lattice setting of gauge theories with a finite , discrete gauge group @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "they were proposed by kitaev as quantum memories in @xcite , with the purpose of obtaining anyonic excitations capable of universal quantum computation by braiding .",
    "mochon @xcite proved that already the model with the smallest non - abelian gauge group @xmath3 is universal in this sense , assuming certain ` magic states ' can be prepared . while exhibiting rich non - abelian anyonic excitations , these models share some of the simplicity of their first instance , the toric code @xcite ( in particular , topological sectors have integral quantum dimensions ) . for a recent review using group theoretic language ,",

    "we now argue that the matrix indices are naturally associated with the beginning and end of an oriented edge , and that the effect of vertex projectors in equation ( [ qdouble : hamiltonian ] ) is to determine the contraction of these indices at each vertex , so the degrees of freedom remaining after imposing vertex projectors are just the irreducible representations of @xmath2 , for which the model can be interpreted as a string - net model , with fusion rules stemming from composition of irreducible representations .    using the inverse change of basis @xmath74_{ab}^ *    { \\lvert \\mu , a , b \\rangle }    \\ ; , \\ ] ]",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath75 where @xmath76 _ { c_i b_i } \\ ] ] is the projector onto the trivial isotypic subspace of @xmath77 . in other words",
    ", it projects out vertex configurations in which the irreducible representations @xmath78 in the tensor product @xmath79 are not coupled to yield the trivial representation .",

    "the trivial propagation of the other indices is represented by the rectangular faces . ]",
    "moreover , since @xmath84 is a projector , it can be split into a direct sum of orthogonal rank - one projectors , each one of which corresponds to an inequivalent fusion channel of the @xmath78 into the vacuum : @xmath85 the number of such channels is the trace @xmath86 the action of @xmath80 fixes how the rightmost indices in the ket @xmath87 should be contracted .",
    "remember that we have defined this action assuming that all adjacent edges point towards @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , these indices correspond naturally to the ends of the oriented edges .",
    "now consider the action of the entire set of vertex projectors on the lattice .",
    "then all matrix indices are contracted according to the annihilation channels of the incoming representations .",
    "hence , if we consider the `` physical '' hilbert space to be the surviving subspace after application of all @xmath80 , the only degrees of freedom left are precisely the irreducible representations of @xmath2 living on oriented edges , with the constraint that representations incident on a given vertex can fuse to the vacuum   as defined in ( [ qdouble : splitw ] ) must also be specified .",

    "we assert that this is the correct action of plaquette projectors in the associated string - net model .",
    "remember from @xcite and section [ sec : stringnets ] that this action is best understood in the fat lattice picture .",

    "the operator @xmath104 is equivalent to creating a loop of label @xmath95 around the puncture of plaquette @xmath0 in the fat lattice and then subsuming it into the original lattice by means of @xmath41-moves ; but in the case of group representations ( and more general representation theories ) @xmath41-symbols are @xmath105-symbols , which can be written entirely in terms of @xmath88-projectors ( thus , of @xmath82 symbols ) as defined in ( [ qdouble : projw ] ) .",
    "this is explained in appendix  [ sec : ident ] .    in order to identify the quantum double with a string - net model we restrict to a trivalent lattice , for definiteness of the honeycomb type .",
    "we need to show that the action of the @xmath106 on the reduced qd states @xmath107 defined in equation [ qdouble : identifstates ] is the same as the action of @xmath108 on states in the sn lattice . to this end",
    "we consider a hexagonal plaquette together with its external legs ; in the string - net model its states are labelled by irreducible representations @xmath109 for the edges in a counterclockwise loop along the plaquette boundary , together with irrep labels @xmath110 for the external legs oriented towards the plaquette .",
    "( the external leg with label @xmath111 is supposed to end at the vertex where label @xmath112 enters and @xmath113 leaves . ) such a state we denote by @xmath114 .",

    "we define states @xmath117 for the same system according to rule ( [ qdouble : identifstates ] ) ; the local hilbert spaces are full group algebras labelled by irrep and matrix indices , but the latter are contracted together with @xmath82 symbols @xmath116 .",

    "the sn definition of plaquette operators relies on @xmath41-symbols , whose extension to configurations violating vertex conditions is somewhat arbitrary . by enlarging the sn local hilbert spaces introducing matrix degrees of freedom and going over to the qd hilbert spaces",
    "where edges carry a full group algebra , we are able to express both plaquette and vertex operators in a way that recovers the sn definition for the reduced states defined in equation ( [ qdouble : identifstates ] ) , but carries over to the full hilbert space . in more concrete terms , we can write @xmath122 in the sense that @xmath123 needs the vertices surrounding the plaquette to fulfil the fusion rules , and in that space its action can be identified with that of @xmath123 ; incidentally , this accounts for the fact that the sn plaquette operators are 12-local while the qd plaquette operators are 6-local .",
    "string - net models obtained from quantum doubles by the fourier mapping can be defined naturally for general planar lattices , and not only in trivalent lattices as a generic sn model .",
    "the reason is that the vertex projectors have a natural interpretation in group representation theory , which generalises to @xmath124-valent vertices : a vertex configuration is allowed if the tensor product of the incident irreducible representations contains the trivial representation .",
    "moreover , group theory also provides us with a natural splitting of the @xmath41-symbols according to equation ( [ qdouble : deff ] ) in appendix  [ sec : ident ] , implying that plaquette projectors act effectively only on the edges of the plaquettes , since the parts associated with the external legs have the form of vertex projectors and act trivially on physical states .",
    "more generally , we have an identification of the superselection sectors as irreducible representations of ( in this case ) the quasi - triangular hopf algebra @xmath32 .",
    "note that the matrix degrees of freedom @xmath66 , @xmath65 which must be added to the string - net lattice to fill the quantum double hilbert spaces with basis @xmath125 allow us to keep track of the internal degrees of freedom within the different irreps of @xmath32 ( e.g. , the group element labels for the conjugacy classes defining the magnetic fluxes , the different vectors for the irreps of the group in electric charges ) .    from a more abstract point of view",
    ", both quantum doubles and their corresponding string - net models can be seen as a procedure to obtain an anyon model , that of the physical excitations , which is a unitary braided tensor category .",
    "this has as objects the superselection sectors , i.e. , the excitations classified by irreducible representations of @xmath32 .",
    "this is both obtained starting with the model defined  la qd , i.e. , starting with a basis labelled by group elements ( objects of a category @xmath2 ) and with the model defined  la sn , with bases labelled by irreps ( objects of a category of representations of @xmath2 ) .",
    "these categories are equivalent in the sense that they have the same excitations .",
    "we have shown explicitly how to identify kitaev s quantum double models @xcite with a subclass of the string - net models of levin and wen s @xcite .",
    "the general construction for string nets can be further simplified in this case due to the interpretation of the fusion rules in terms of group theory .    as a result",
    ", the subclass of sn models corresponding to qd models can be extended naturally to arbitrary planar lattices ; their excitations can be given a representation - theoretic interpretation at the price of introducing auxiliary degrees of freedom necessary to keep track of the internal spaces of the different representations ; and the electric - magnetic duality is recovered , in that plaquette projectors can be given a natural definition that does not depend on the completion of @xmath41-symbols outside the space of recouplings with legal vertices .",
    "this provides a local characterisation of excitations which we find satisfactory .",
    "interestingly , from the point of view of category theory the construction can be seen as an instance of morita equivalence , which stresses the practical importance of these models as laboratories to provide simple examples of abstract mathematical notions which , in spite of their importance , are only in their way to become everyday tools of theoretical physicists .",
    "let us stress the significance of this construction .",
    "on the one hand , it is a nontrivial mapping relating the physics of two different classes of topological models .",
    "we have tried to emphasise the interplay of physical degrees of freedom which is needed to show this relationship , and how the smaller local hilbert space for the string - net lattice can be naturally enlarged to the local hilbert space of the corresponding quantum double model . on the other hand ,",
    "it allows for a clearer picture of the anyons appearing as physical excitations of the particular class of string nets obtained from our mapping , and this picture can be extended to more general string - net models as we mention below .",
    "this construction will help throw light as well on the relations among different tensor network constructions developed recently to describe exactly both quantum doubles @xcite@xcite and string - net models @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is necessary to discuss the relation between kitaev s ribbon operators @xcite and the loop operators defined by levin and wen @xcite .",
    "the current construction can be extended to models based on local degrees of freedom where the hilbert space constitutes a @xmath126-hopf algebra ( as anticipated in @xcite ) ; this generalisation will be given in @xcite , where the corresponding relations among tensor network descriptions will also be discussed .",
    "the case of models based on weak quasi - hopf algebras @xcite is the subject of work in progress @xcite .",
    "this will extend the representation - theoretic approach to excitations to wider subclasses of string - net models .",
    "_ note added : _ after submission of this article , related work ( including a discussion of ribbon operators ) was reported in @xcite .",

    "we thank ignacio cirac , andrew doherty , steve flammia , liang kong , and zhenghan wang for relevant discussions and comments .",
    "it can be shown that the projector onto the trivial representation subspace of the product @xmath127 of irreducible representations of group @xmath2 splits into a sum of orthogonal projectors associated with the internal channel @xmath128 in the coupling scheme @xmath129 , say , as @xmath130 where the projectors @xmath131 are expressed in terms of @xmath88 connecting three irreducible representations .",
    ", so these are rank one projectors as long as the three - irrep @xmath88 s are . ]",
    "this leads to the definition of the @xmath132 operation as the change of basis , within the range of @xmath133 , from the states associated with @xmath134 to those of the alternative coupling scheme @xmath135 .",
    "explicitly , the operators read @xmath136 and obviously commute with @xmath133 . from here",
