    "absorption edges are visible in the x - ray spectra of about one half of all low redshift agn ( reynolds 1997 ; george et al .  1998 ;",
    "crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ) , virtually all of which also show high - ionization absorption lines in their uv spectra ( crenshaw et al .",
    "1999 ) , suggesting a connection between the two phenomena .",
    "the absorption is thought to be intrinsic to the agn because the complexes are generally blueshifted with respect to the agns , and because many absorbers show variability and/or non - unity covering fractions .",
    "( see references in kriss et al.in this proceeding . )",
    "most high resolution observations of the intrinsic absorption in agns , with the exception of recently published observations of mrk  279 ( scott et al .",
    "2004 ) , have been performed at different times in the uv and x - rays .",
    "the high degree of variability in agn continua complicates self - consistent photoionization modeling from these non - simultaneous data , preventing firm conclusions about the nature of the relationship between uv and x - ray absorbers .",
    "the intrinsic absorption in ngc  7469 has been studied previously using uv and x - ray observations separated by one year ( blustin et al .",
    "2003 ; kriss et al .",
    "these authors found two primary uv components , with outflow velocities of -569 and -1898 km s@xmath0 , components 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "chandra ( cxo ) _ , _ fuse _ , and _",
    "hst_/stis campaign presented here is the first set of simultaneous , high - resolution uv and x - ray spectral observations of ngc  7469 . here , we describe the uv and x - ray observations and the properties of the agn outflow , and we discuss the geometry of the absorption using the results from photoionization models .",
    "we obtained a 150 ksec _ cxo_/hetg spectrum of ngc  7469 on 2002 december 12 - 13 , covering 0.5 - 10 kev .",
    "we fit this with an absorbed blackbody + power law continuum , with a photon index of 1.82 and galactic @xmath1 @xmath2 . on 2002",
    "december 13 , we observed ngc  7469 with the @xmath3 low - resolution aperture of _ fuse _ , obtaining a total exposure of 7 ksec .",
    "simultaneously , we obtained 13 ksec of stis data using the e140 m grating and the @xmath4 aperture covering 1150 - 1730   .",
    "we fit the _ fuse _ and stis data with a single power law continuum : @xmath5 ( @xmath6/1000  )@xmath7 ergs s@xmath0 @xmath2 @xmath0 and with gaussian emission line profiles from , ly  @xmath8 , , + , , , , and in the vicinity of the intrinsic absorption lines of interest .",
    "we also observed ngc  7469 with stis on 2004 june 21 - 22 for 23 ksec using the same setup described above .",
    "for this spectrum , we fit @xmath9 ( @xmath6/1000  )@xmath10 ergs s@xmath0 @xmath2 @xmath0 .",
    "we measured covering fractions and column densities of the intrinsic absorbers using the iraf task _ specfit _ ( kriss 1994 ) , and we compared photoionization models ( krolik & kriss 1995 , 2001 ) to the measured , , , and column densities .",
    "we incorporated the observed x - ray and uv slopes and normalizations at the time of the 2002 observations into the input spectral energy distribution for ngc  7469 ( kriss et al .",
    "2000 , 2003 ) .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    1 .",
    "component 1 shows saturated or nearly saturated absorption .",
    "neutral hydrogen is clearly present , as ly@xmath8 is a strong feature , but ly@xmath11 is not detected .",
    "the _ fuse _ spectrum near ly@xmath11 is heavily contaminated by molecular hydrogen absorption .",
    "the and features associated with this velocity component are weak .",
    "2 .   component 2 shows prominent and ly@xmath8 absorption . as for component 1 , no ly@xmath11 is found , but the and features are stronger than those of component 1 . 3 .",
    "we do not detect or absorption in the _ cxo _ spectrum , but we do detect emission and absorption from h - like and he - like si , ne , and mg at velocities consistent with component 1 .",
    "component 2 has no associated x - ray absorber .",
    "consistent with previous results ( kriss et al .",
    "2003 ) , the covering fraction for component 1 is @xmath120.5 , while that of component 2 is consistent with one .",
    "5 .   we see absorption variability in component 1 over the three observation epochs ( fig .",
    "1 ) : the absorption strengthened between the 1999 _ fuse _ observations ( kriss et al .",
    "2003 ) and those presented here , as the continuum flux decreased by a factor of @xmath121.5 ; and the ly@xmath8 absorption increased between 2002 and 2004 as the continuum flux decreased by a factor of @xmath122.5 . 6 .",
    "the photoionization models combined with the , , , and column density measurements show that ( log(n),u)@xmath12(20.0,1.0 ) for component 1 and ( log n , u)@xmath12(18.5,0.08 ) for component 2 .",
    "the and column densities are particularly useful for breaking the degeneracy in models based on alone .",
    "our conclusions are consistent with the previous physical picture of the outflow ( blustin et al .  2003 ; kriss et al .  2003 ) .",
    "component 1 is a highly - ionized , high density absorber that is coincident with or interior to the broad emission line region and related to the x - ray absorption and emission component .",
    "compared with component 1 , component 2 is a lower density and ionization parameter system located at a larger physical distance from the central engine in the absorbing outflow .",
