    "in the last few years a lot of effort has been devoted to developments of techniques which allow the evaluation of higher order corrections .",
    "of special interest is thereby the evaluation of qcd corrections to two - point current correlators .",
    "their knowledge immediately leads to a variety of important observables like the cross section @xmath2 mediated by a photon or a @xmath3 boson or the decay of a scalar or pseudo - scalar higgs boson .",
    "whereas at the one- and two - loop level exact results are known ( for a review see @xcite ) , until recently at @xmath4 only expansions for large external momentum @xmath0 respectively small quark mass @xmath5 were available .    in @xcite",
    "an approach was developed which leads to semi - analytical results for the three - loop polarization functions .",
    "the essence of this procedure amounts to the combination of the low- and high - energy analytical data for a polarization function through the use of the conformal mapping and pad approximation suggested in @xcite .    in a first step",
    "it was applied to the non - singlet diagrams induced by external vector , axial - vector , scalar and pseudo - scalar currents  @xcite . in this paper",
    "this procedure will be applied to the corresponding singlet diagrams .",
    "they are often also referred to as double - triangle diagrams as the external currents are not connected through the same fermion line .",
    "this completes the knowledge of the three - loop current correlators at @xmath4 .",
    "thus also the full mass dependence for the inclusive cross sections @xmath6 and the decays of a scalar or pseudo - scalar higgs boson into quarks is available at this order .",
    "the method used in @xcite heavily relies on the fact that the lowest particle threshold for the non - singlet graphs starts at @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast to that , the singlet diagrams contain massless cuts .",
    "the solution of this problem is described in detail for the axial - vector correlator in section  [ secax ] . also the essential ingredients are listed and the approximation procedure is briefly reviewed .",
    "section  [ secscps ] describes the treatment of the scalar and pseudo - scalar diagrams and finally results are presented in section  [ secres ] .",
    "note that for the vector correlator there are no singlet diagrams at three - loop level according to furry s theorem .",
    "in this section the ingredients and the procedure for the construction of the pad approximants of the axial - vector polarization function are presented in detail .",
    "the scalar and pseudo - scalar singlet diagrams are discussed in section  [ secscps ] .",
    "let us start with some definitions .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the center of mass energy and @xmath5 is the pole mass of the produced quark .",
    "@xmath10 is a convenient variable in the high energy region and @xmath11 represents the velocity of the quark .",
    "the axial - vector polarization function is defined through @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "only the transversal part @xmath14 will be considered in the following . in @xmath15 space - time dimensions care",
    "has to be taken concerning the treatment of @xmath16  especially in connection with the singlet diagrams .",
    "we follow the treatment introduced in @xcite and refer for more details to @xcite .    in order for the axial anomaly to cancel ,",
    "one has to take both members of a weak isospin doublet into account .",
    "it is therefore convenient to replace the current @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eqpivadef ] ) by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are isospin partners .",
    "the diagrams contributing to the singlet part , @xmath21 , are depicted in fig .",
    "[ figdiasing ] where in the fermion triangles either @xmath19 or @xmath20 may be present .",
    "note that for a degenerate quark doublet @xmath22 vanishes .",
    "having in mind the physical case @xmath23 , however , we set @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the subsequent analysis .       in the following handy approximation formulae for the imaginary parts @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    "are given . to keep the formulae as short as possible a pad approximant containing the high energy input up to @xmath28 is selected .",
    "after subtraction of the known analytic results the ( small ) remainder , which vanishes both for @xmath29 and @xmath30 is approximated using legendre polynomials .",
    "the results read : @xmath31 , \\\\",
    "r_s^{(2),s } & = & \\frac{3}{2 } + \\frac{27}{4}v-\\frac{33}{4}v^3 \\nonumber\\\\&&\\mbox { } + 3\\left(\\frac{m^2}{s}\\right)^{3/2}\\left(v^4 - 2 v^2\\right)^4 \\nonumber\\\\&&\\mbox { } + 50p^{3/2 } ( 1-p ) \\left [ -0.193\\ , p_0(p ) + 0.111\\ , p_1(p ) + 0.0277\\ , p_2(p ) \\right ] , \\\\ r_s^{(2),p } & = & \\pi^4 \\left(\\frac{3}{32 } - \\frac{9}{64}v + \\frac{3}{64}v^3\\right ) \\nonumber\\\\&&\\mbox { } - 35 \\left(\\frac{m^2}{s}\\right)^{3/2}\\left(v^4 - 2 v^2\\right)^4 \\nonumber\\\\&&\\mbox { } + 50p^{3/2 } ( 1-p ) \\left [ 1.586\\ , p_0(p ) -1.822\\ , p_1(p ) + 0.525\\ , p_2(p ) \\right ] \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath32 .",
    "note again that the corresponding massless cuts ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eqrsb ] ) and ( [ eqrgg ] ) ) have to be subtracted in order to find the rates for , e.g. , @xmath33 production .",
    "to summarize , the polarization functions for axial - vector , scalar and pseudo - scalar singlet current correlators have been computed . to this end",
    "the knowledge of @xmath34 for @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 has been exploited in combination with conformal mapping and pad approximation .",
    "results have been presented for the imaginary parts and handy approximation formulae have been provided .",
    "this completes the evaluation of three - loop polarization functions at @xmath4 as in @xcite the non - singlet contributions were considered .",
