    "in recent years , the interest in atomically thin two - dimensional materials with honeycomb lattice structure have grown considerably after the realization of single layer graphene @xcite .",
    "apart from graphene there are other crystals like silicene @xcite , boron nitride@xcite , monolayer group - vi dichalcogenides mx@xmath0 ( and ) etc . which also have a honeycomb lattice structure .",
    "currently , the dichalcogenide material mos@xmath0 ( molybdenum disulphide ) @xcite has drawn lot of attention due to its unique electronic@xcite , optical @xcite and transport @xcite properties . like graphene ,",
    "the brillouin zone of monolayer mos@xmath0 consists of two inequivalent @xmath1 points .",
    "however , unlike graphene mos@xmath0 monolayer is a direct band - gap semiconductor with a gap@xcite of the order of @xmath2 ev . since the band gap lies in the visible frequency range , it is also suitable for optoelectronic device applications .    in 1930 , schrdinger @xcite pointed out that a relativistic electron in vacuum , described by the dirac equation , exhibits rapid oscillations , which are manifested in the time evolution of physical observables such as position , current and spin angular momentum .",
    "this phenomenon , also known as _ zitterbewegung _ ( zb ) , occurs due to the superposition@xcite of electron and hole counterparts of the dirac spinor .",
    "experimental observation of zb has been illusive till date due to the large oscillation frequency @xmath3 hz and the small oscillation amplitude @xmath4 m. in addition , it was shown by lock @xcite that the zb oscillations of dirac electrons described by a wave packet decay with time .",
    "_ zitterbewegung _ is not necessarily a relativistic effect .",
    "it can also occur in non - relativistic electrons , _",
    "e.g. _ , in crystalline solids @xcite , and is a direct consequence of coupling between the energy eigenstates of the system . in 2005 , zawadzki @xcite showed that the oscillation amplitude of zb is enhanced by a factor of @xmath5 in narrow gap semiconductors . in the same year , schliemann et .",
    "@xcite studied the wave packet dynamics and zb in spin - orbit coupled two - dimensional electron gas formed at the heterojunctions .",
    "these works triggered a large number of theoretical investigations of wave packet dynamics and zb in various condensed matter systems @xcite , including carbon nanotubes @xcite , graphene @xcite , superconductors @xcite and hole luttinger systems @xcite .",
    "the wave packet dynamics and zb have also been studied in other systems such as 2d photonic crystal@xcite , 2d sonic crystal @xcite and spin - orbit coupled atomic gases @xcite .",
    "the relation between amplitude of zb oscillations and berry connection was explicitly shown in refs .",
    "recently experimental observations of zb phenomenon has been reported in trapped ion systems @xcite as well as in @xmath6rb bose einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "in this article we study the dynamics of electrons described by an initial gaussian wave packet in monolayer mos@xmath0 . in the absence of an external magnetic field , we find the expected behaviour of oscillations and decay of the wave packet amplitude , which is manifested in the the expectation values of physical observables such as position and velocity . in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field , _",
    "i.e. _ , for a discrete landau level spectrum , the long term dynamics of the wave packet shows the phenomena of spontaneous collapse and revival @xcite of the wave packet amplitude , which is a direct example of the so called _ quantum recurrence theorem _ @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we discuss low energy hamiltonian , the electronic eigenstates and eigen - energies of a mos@xmath0 monolayer .",
    "we then study the dynamics of physical observables such as the position and velocity , and find that these are characterized by particular oscillation frequencies and decay constant . in section iii we explore the dynamics of a gaussian wave packet in the presence of a transverse magnetic field . starting with the landau level spectrum and the corresponding wave functions of mos@xmath0 monolayer , we calculate the long term time evolution of physical observables of an initial gaussian wave packet .",
    "we find the phenomena of spontaneous collapse and consequent revival here , for which the associated timescales follow from the expansion of the wave packet energy around some dominant landau level @xcite .",
    "we summarize our work in section iv .",
    "the single particle low - energy hamiltonian of monolayer mos@xmath0 , in the vicinity of each of the two valley s at the edges of the hexagonal first brillouin zone ( bz ) , denoted by @xmath1 and @xmath7 respectively , is given by @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fermi velocity , @xmath10 is the wave vector of electron around @xmath1 points , and @xmath11 is the ` direct ' band gap at the corner points of hexagonal bz . here @xmath12 denotes the valley @xmath1 and @xmath13 denotes the @xmath7 valley .",
    "the set of pauli matrices given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 act on the conduction band - valance band space and the electron - spin space , respectively , and the symbol @xmath16 denotes the direct product . in eq .",
    "the term @xmath17 represents the hamiltonian corresponding to the spin - orbit interaction , which can be described by the following expression h_so=_so^c_z+ _",
    "so^v_z  , where @xmath18 is the spin - orbit gap in the conduction ( valence ) band . typically in mos@xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath19 mev and @xmath20 mev so that the gap @xmath21 can be neglected and the effective soi gap can be approximated as @xmath22 .",
    "we note that even though @xmath17 is different in the two valleys , it is a constant for each valley , and the system is equivalent to two spin - resolved dirac hamiltonians given by , [ haml_tot ] h = v_f(q_x_x+q_y_y)+_s_z+ _  , where the spin and valley dependent gap is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 denoting the up - spin and down - spin electron respectively .",
    "the last term of constant energy , @xmath25 , plays no physical role and will be neglected henceforth .",
    "we emphasise here that eq .  , is a spin and valley resolved hamiltonian whose low energy spectrum coincides with the massive dirac equation in two dimensions - with a gap that is dependent on the spin and valley index .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of the spin and valley resolved hamiltonian , in eq .  ,",
    "are given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the conduction and valance bands respectively .",
    "the corresponding eigen - functions are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "in the rest of the article , we will ` inject ' an electronic gaussian wave function in monolayer mos@xmath0 , and study its dynamics . a generic wave packet for mos@xmath0 will have a eight - component spinor form , but",
    "since the spin and valley parts of the low energy hamiltonian are decoupled from each other , each of the two - component spinors ( corresponding to conduction and valance bands ) evolve independently of each other .",
    "henceforth we only consider the evolution of ` spin and valley polarized ' two - component spinor .      to describe the time evolution of electron wave packets we start with an electronic gaussian wave packet ( _ i.e. _ , a spinor wave packet having the conduction band component as unity and no valance band component ) , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a gaussian wave packet of width @xmath32 , which is initially centered at @xmath33 , in the momentum space .",
    "note that @xmath32 should be greater than the lattice spacing , so that @xmath34 is a smooth enveloping function .",
    "the wave packet at a later time @xmath35 can be found by operating the time evolution operator , @xmath36 , on the initial state _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath37 .",
    "straightforward calculation gives the spinor wave packet at a later time @xmath35 to be of the following form in the fourier space :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 is half of the difference between the two energy states of the conduction and valance bands , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the real space spinor components , are now simply given by @xmath42 =   \\int d^2q ~e^{i{\\bf q } \\cdot { \\bf r } } ~[\\phi_1 ( { \\bf q},t ) , \\phi_2 ( { \\bf q},t)]$ ] .",
    "the expectation value of position operator can now be calculated using the momentum representation of the position operator : @xmath43 , and is given by the following equation , ( t ) = id^2q ^(*q*,t ) _ * q * ( * q*,t )  .",
    "straightforward calculation yields @xmath44 for the specific choice of @xmath45 adopted here , it is easy to show that @xmath46 . for definiteness , in the rest of the manuscript",
    "we choose , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and define @xmath49 .",
    "now , by considering the initial momentum of the gaussian wave packet along @xmath50 direction ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) one can obtain the expectation value of @xmath53 component of the position operator (  _ transverse _ to the initial momentum of the wave packet ) to be    [ posx ] x(t)= _ 0^d _ q  , where we have defined [ eq : eta ] _ q = de^-q_0 ^ 2d^2 e^-^2i_1(2q_0d ) and @xmath54 is the ( first order ) modified bessel function of second kind and we have defined the dimensionless parameters : @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 . note that for @xmath58 , the modified bessel function of the second kind has the following asymptotic form , @xmath59 .    the integrations over @xmath60 in eq .",
    "is performed numerically , and the time dependence of the position expectation value is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "two prominent features observed in fig .  [ fig1]a ) are , the oscillations or zb in the expectation value and the decay of the oscillation amplitude of zb",
    ". the oscillation timescale of the zb can be extracted , by working in the @xmath61 limit where one can use the asymptotic form of the modified bessel function given above , and noting that in eq .",
    ", @xmath62 .",
    "this implies that the integrand in eq .   is peaked around @xmath63 and consequently the oscillation timescale of zb",
    "is given by [ eq : tauzb ] _",
    "the decay in the oscillation amplitude of zb , occurs due to the interference of different frequencies , corresponding to different @xmath60 in eq .  .",
    "this decay timescale can be obtained from eq .  , by using the exponential form of @xmath64 to include the time dependence in the exponential terms .",
    "straightforward algebra gives the decay of the oscillation amplitude to be of the form : @xmath65 , where [ eq : decay ] _ d^-2 =  . as a check of our estimate",
    "we note that eq .",
    "fits very well to the exact numerical results  see the solid black lines in fig .  [ fig1]a ) .    the @xmath50 component of the position operator (  _ longitudinal _ to the initial momentum of the wave packet ) is given by [ posy ] y(t)= 2 _ 0^d _ q  , where @xmath66 was defined in eq .  .",
    "as expected due to finite initial momentum in the @xmath50 direction , the centre of the wave packet moves in the @xmath50 direction with a constant velocity .",
    "the zb oscillations occur around the centre of the moving wave packet on the timescale given by @xmath67 , but with reduced amplitude , due to the presence of @xmath68 in the denominator of the oscillating term  see fig .",
    "[ fig1]b ) .",
    "eventually , for @xmath69 , the oscillating contribution to @xmath70 becomes vanishingly small in comparison to the term linearly increasing with time .",
    "the components of the velocity operator can be obtained from the heisenberg equation of motion : @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "the expectation value of the velocity components can now be calculated by using the spinor wave functions in eq .  , and are given by [ velcx ] v_x(t)= _ 0^d _ q ( 2 _ * q * )  , and [ velcy ] v_y(t)= x(t )   .",
    "as a check of our calculations , we note that @xmath72 and @xmath73 can also be obtained directly by differentiating eq .   and",
    "eq .   with respect to time . in fig .  [ fig1]c ) .",
    "we plot the time dependence of the @xmath53 component of the velocity operator and it shows a behaviour similar to that of the position operator .",
    "we note in passing that in the @xmath74 limit , the mos@xmath0 energy spectrum reduces to graphene energy spectrum . in the same limit ,",
    "our result reproduce the known results for wave packet dynamics in monolayer graphene @xcite ( in the absence of magnetic field ) . in particular , eq",

    "in this section we study the cyclotron dynamics of an electron wave packet in a magnetic field @xmath75 , perpendicular to the monolayer mos@xmath0 plane . before we calculate the long term dynamics of the injected wave packet , it is useful to review the timescales associated with the dynamics in systems with discrete energy levels .",
    "any 2d electronic system subjected to a transverse magnetic field , leads to the formation of discretized landau levels .",
    "the dynamical evolution of wave packets of a quantum system with discrete but non - equidistant energy spectrum is generally quiet complex due to quantum interference .",
    "however several well defined periodicities emerge @xcite , if the initial wave packet is peaked around some large landau level characterized by @xmath76 .",
    "various timescales which emerge for a discrete systems with non - equidistant energy spectrum , can be understood from the approximate analytic form of the autocorrelation function@xcite of the wave packet , which is defined as @xmath77 . expanding this wave packet in terms of the orthonormal eigenstates of the system under consideration , @xmath78 , labelled by discrete landau level index @xmath79",

    "the wave packet comes back to the initial position and the autocorrelation function approximately reaches its initial value . for the ` quantum ' revival of the wave packet",
    "the terms proportional to the second derivative in the energy should be in multiples of @xmath90 , and this leads to additional recurrences of the initial wave packet at time @xmath91 .",

    "moreover , at times that are rational fractions of @xmath92 , the wave packet undergoes fractional revivals , _ i.e. _ , a sequence of reconstructions , which give regular well - localised structure of the wave packet amplitude .",
    "the fractional revival at @xmath93 is particularly interesting , as it represents the initial wave packet shifted by half of the classical period @xcite ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath94 ) .",
    "in addition to these , for @xmath95 , the terms quadratic in @xmath96 lead to the dephasing and consequently collapse of the initial wave packet over timescale given by , @xmath97 .",

    "<S> we study the dynamics of electrons in monolayer molybdenum disulfide ( mos@xmath0 ) , in the absence as well as presence of a transverse magnetic field . considering the initial electronic wave function to be a gaussian wave packet , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the time dependent expectation value of position and velocity operators . in the absence of the magnetic field , the time dependent average values of position and velocity show damped oscillations dependent on the width of the wave packet . in the presence of a transverse magnetic field , the wave packet amplitude shows oscillatory behaviour over short timescales associated with classical cyclotron orbit , followed by the phenomena of spontaneous collapse and revival over larger timescales . </S>",
    "<S> we relate the timescales of these effects and our results can be useful for the interpretation of experiments with trapped ions . </S>"
