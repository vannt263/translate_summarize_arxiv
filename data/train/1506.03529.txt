    "of course our degeneration is over the @xmath15-adic unit disc , so we can not use van kampen s theorem directly .",
    "our main idea is to use deformation theory to conclude that @xmath11 admits an analogous ( but no longer explicit ) degeneration over the complex unit disc to a complex surface @xmath20 with a @xmath16 singularity such that its minimal resolution is a complex dolgachev surface analogous to the boyd surface .    as an application of our construction",
