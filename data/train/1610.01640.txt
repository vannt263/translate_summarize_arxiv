    "the aim of this section is to provide a short introduction to the subject and to add some details of the computations presented in the main text .",
    "the starting point is to consider an hamiltonian system written as the sum of two parts , the integrable hamiltonian @xmath34 and the perturbation term @xmath35 of order @xmath69 ( where @xmath70 is a small parameter ) @xmath71    the goal of the hamiltonian control theory is to slightly modify eq .",
    "( [ eq : ap_ham ] ) by adding a control term , small in front of @xmath35 , in such a way the new controlled hamiltonian @xmath72 exhibits some suitable features , for instance to improve the regularity of the dynamics , because we expect a much lesser chaotic dynamics and the appearance of regular structures such as invariant tori in the phase plane .    to achieve this goal",
    "we should assume the existence of an operator @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the lie algebra of the functions defined on the phase space , such that verifies @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the poisson brackets and do satisfy @xmath77 ( antisymmetry ) and @xmath78 ( jacobi identity ) , for all @xmath79 .",
    "we call such operator the _ pseudo - inverse _ of @xmath80 , observe that in general it is not unique ; because @xmath40 has a non trivial kernel ( e.g. @xmath81 ) , eq .",
    "is the minimal requirement to have a sort of inversion .    from @xmath82",
    "we define two other operators : the _ non - resonant _ operator @xmath83 and the _ resonant _ one @xmath84 as follows : @xmath85 @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the identity of the lie algebra @xmath74 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath88 the flow generated by @xmath37 , that is @xmath89 , then the main result of  @xcite can be stated as follows , under the previous assumptions the following conjugation formula does hold @xmath90 where the function @xmath91 is defined by @xmath92    the previous formula means that if we add the small control term @xmath39 of order @xmath93 to @xmath94 , then the orbits of the controlled version of the system ( [ eq : ap_ham ] ) will coincide with the ones of the unperturbed system @xmath34 except for the ( possible ) presence of the resonant term @xmath95 .",
    "this makes the controlled orbits much more regular then the ones of the original uncontrolled system .",
    "let us observe that if the hamiltonian system @xmath34 can be written in action ",
    "angle variables , @xmath96 , in the vicinity of an elliptic equilibrium , that is @xmath97 , for some frequency vector @xmath98 , then the pseudo - inverse operator can be formally written as : @xmath99 if the frequency vector is non - resonant , namely @xmath100 for all @xmath101 , then @xmath95 reduces to the constant term of @xmath102 once written in fourier series .",
    "let us conclude by applying the previous theory to the hamiltonian model presented in the main text eq .",

    "<S> many coordination phenomena are based on a synchronisation process , whose global behaviour emerges from the interactions among the individual parts . often in nature </S>",
    "<S> , such self - organising mechanism allows the system to behave as a whole and thus grounding its very first existence , or expected functioning , on such process . </S>",
    "<S> there are however cases where synchronisation acts against the stability of the system ; for instance in the case of engineered structures , resonances among sub parts can destabilise the whole system . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we propose an innovative control method to tackle the synchronisation process based on the use of the hamiltonian control theory , by adding a small control term to the system we are able to impede the onset of the synchronisation . </S>",
    "<S> we present our results on the paradigmatic kuramoto model but the applicability domain is far more large .    </S>",
    "<S> synchronisation is one of the most important example of collective behaviour in nature , being at the basis of many processes in living beings  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , their activity is regulated by ( almost ) periodic processes of different duration that must run at unison to determine a collective behaviour  @xcite enable to sustain life . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason synchronisation is widespread and it has been studied in many research domains such as biology ( flashing of fireflies @xcite and the cricket chirping @xcite during the mating season ) , chemistry ( glycolytic oscillations in populations of yeast cells @xcite ) , physics ( arrays of coupled lasers @xcite and the superconducting josephson junctions @xcite ) , just to mention few of them . </S>",
    "<S> one of the most representative case being the heart  @xcite , an organ of vital importance for all species in the animal kingdom ; the heart is composed by a collection of individual cells , myocytes , whose complex interactions among them are responsible for the ability to pump blood in the circulatory system . </S>",
    "<S> initially , at embryonic state , such cells do not interact each other and their beats are independent , only after a couple of days , the myocytes form interconnected sheets of cells that help them beat in unison . the absence of such synchronisation phenomenon in human induces cardiac arrhythmia and artificial pacemakers are necessary to recover the normal behaviour .    despite the very different nature of the systems exhibiting synchronisation phenomena , most of the main features are quite universal and can thus be described using the paradigmatic kuramoto model ( km )  @xcite of coupled non - linear oscillators . once the @xmath0 oscillators are set on top of a complex network  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the km can be described by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the interaction strength , @xmath3 are the natural frequencies of the oscillators drawn from some distribution @xmath4 and @xmath5 the undirected network adjacency matrix , i.e. @xmath6 if oscillators @xmath7 and @xmath8 are directly coupled and zero otherwise . </S>",

    "<S> let us observe that there are cases where such collective rhythm has a negative impact on the organism life  @xcite ; for instance , it has been observed , that certain psychomotor symptoms , e.g. tremors , are results of an abnormal synchronisation phenomenon in the activity of the responsible neuronal zones , whose outcome is the onset of diseases such as epilepsy or parkinson  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these issues related to undesired level of synchronisation are well known to engineerings ; consider for instance the case of the millennium bridge in london  @xcite , soon after its inauguration , dangerous lateral vibrations appeared , causing its immediate closure . </S>",

    "<S> based on the above observations , scholars quickly realised the great importance of control  @xcite and possibly impeding the collective synchronisation to prevent negative undesired effects . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we introduce an effective control method for the kuramoto system , inspired by the hamiltonian control theory  @xcite already successfully applied in other frameworks , such as plasmas fusion  @xcite and particles accelerators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the km is a dissipative system , however recently witthaut and timme proposed  @xcite an hamiltonian model which embeds the kuramoto model , roughly speaking the system possesses an invariant torus upon which the hamiltonian dynamics is the same of the original km . moreover it can be shown that the kuramoto oscillators are phase - locked if and only if the hamiltonian invariant torus is unstable . hence controlling the hamiltonian systems to achieve , or not , the stability of the invariant torus , results to be a suitable strategy to control the synchronisation phenomenon in the kuramoto model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consider the following @xmath0 dimensional hamiltonian system , which generalises the one proposed in  @xcite to the case of a network of @xmath0 oscillators @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the vectors of the angles variables and the actions variables . </S>",
    "<S> the previous model represents a class of systems able to describe the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model in the thermodynamic limit @xcite and of the bose - einstein condensate in a tilted optical lattice @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the function @xmath17 describes the non - linear interaction among the pairs of oscillators while the parameter @xmath18 provides its strength . </S>",
    "<S> the adjacency matrix @xmath5 encodes the connections among the oscillators . </S>",

    "<S> to the latter gives : @xmath31 it has been proved  @xcite that when the kuramoto oscillators of ( [ eq : kurmod ] ) enter in a synchronisation phase , then the dynamics of the actions close to the kuramoto torus , become unstable and exhibit a chaotic behaviour ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig1 ] ) .       </S>",
    "<S> +       based on the above remark , our aim is to eliminate ( reduce ) the synchronisation from the km   by controlling the hamiltonian system   by adding a smallcontrol term able to increase the stability of the invariant torus @xmath32 and thus to impede the phase - lock of the coupled oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> let us observe that this approach is completely different from the classical feedback control method where one adds a term , usually of the same order of magnitude of the uncontrolled system , depending on some measurement of the system state , that can also produce a time - delay in the dynamics .    to be more precise let us rewrite the hamiltonian   in the form @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the integrable part , i.e. the uncoupled harmonic oscillators , and @xmath35 the non - linear term that can be considered as a perturbation of @xmath34 because of the smallness of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the main idea of vittot and coworkers  @xcite is to add a small control term @xmath36 to @xmath37 in order to reduce the impact of the perturbation @xmath35 , roughly speaking to increase the stability of the invariant torus , eventually obtaining the controlled hamiltonian function : @xmath38 in terms of costs the size of @xmath39 implies that the controlling procedure is much less invasive that other techniques generally used in control theory and also able to give a prompt response to possible abnormal dynamics without time lags .    starting from @xmath34 one can construct a linear operator @xmath40 defined on the vector space of @xmath41-real functions defined on the phase space , such that @xmath42 is the poisson bracket between @xmath34 and @xmath43 . then the control term can be explicitly obtained  @xcite as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the pseudo - inverse operator of the hamiltonian function @xmath34 and @xmath46 the resonant part of the perturbation term @xmath35  . for a sake of simplicity and </S>",

    "<S> the embedding of the km into the hamiltonian   and thus the possibility to control the former by controlling the latter , is based on the existence of the invariant torus @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> however the controlled hamiltonian @xmath51 no longer verifies such property once one uses the full control term @xmath39 , one can nevertheless provide an _ effective _ control by truncating the latter to it first term @xmath52 . because @xmath53 preserves </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig1 ] ( panels @xmath56 , @xmath43 ) we report the results of some numerical simulations of the controlled km  ; one can clearly appreciate that even for relatively large coupling @xmath57 , the angles are drifting and the actions become stable again while in the uncontrolled km they where phase - locked ( see panels @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , @xmath61 in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig3 ] we present the results of numerical simulations of the original km and of the controlled one both involving @xmath65 oscillators , by showing the behaviour of the order parameter as a function of the coupling strength @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is a well known result that there exists a synchronisation threshold @xmath66 above which @xmath67 and the oscillators of the km do synchronise ( blue curve in fig .
