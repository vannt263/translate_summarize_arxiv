    "in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in the study of extended low - surface brightness galaxies @xcite .",
    "the discovery of dozens of these objects in the coma cluster ( coined udgs by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been followed by a large number of detections in other clusters , groups and in the field @xcite .",
    "the low stellar mass ( 10@xmath8 - 10@xmath10 m@xmath9 ) of these objects together with their large size ( r@xmath141.5 kpc ) have opened a number of questions about the ultimate nature of these galaxies : are udgs `` failed '' galaxies ( i.e. do they inhabit dark matter halos larger than those expected according to their stellar mass content ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "what is the role of environment ?",
    "are the properties of udgs produced by their interaction with dense environments @xcite ?",
    "are they simply the high - spin tail of normal dwarf galaxies @xcite ?",
    "are udgs produced by feedback - driven gas outflows and subsequent dark matter and stellar expansion @xcite ?",
    "observations indicate that udgs are a heterogeneous population of dwarf galaxies .",
    "some of them are relatively red ( g - i@xmath50.8 ) , have spheroidal shapes , and inhabit rich galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas other udgs are blue ( g - i@xmath50.4 ) , have irregular shapes and are found in groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "are all these udgs connected evolutively ?",
    "recently , @xcite have suggested a scenario where all this diversity could be understood if udg progenitors were born in the field , processed by groups , and ended their lives inhabiting clusters . to answer all the above questions and shed more light on the nature of udgs , it would be extremely useful to have the opportunity to probe , in full detail , the properties of a close ( d@xmath1515 mpc ) udg .",
    "this would give us the opportunity to explore its individual stars .",
    "in particular , it would be extremely useful to have some information about the gas content of one of these galaxies . in this work",
    ", we present the serendipitous discovery of a very nearby udg : the galaxy ugc2162 .",
    "this galaxy is located in the m77 group ( at only 12.3 mpc distance from us ) and has hi observations .",
    "this proximity allows us to have a superb spatial resolution of 60 pc / arcsec . in this work",
    ", we conduct a detailed analysis of the characteristics of this galaxy and confront the observational data with the theoretical expectations .",
    "as we will show , this galaxy is quite rich in hi gas and is currently forming stars at a rate of 0.01 m@xmath9/yr .",
    "if this galaxy were suddenly depleted of its gas , it would evolve into a red ( g - i@xmath50.8 ) object with",
    "r@xmath16@xmath51.8 kpc and @xmath2@xmath527 mag / arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "all of these are characteristics of the population of the faintest udgs currently found in rich clusters @xcite .",

    "the following work is based on the rectified images of this dataset ( http://www.iac.es/proyecto/stripe82/ ) .",
    "the mean limiting surface brightness of this data co - addition is 29.1 , 28.6 , and 28.1 mag arcsec@xmath17 in the g , r , and i bands respectively ( 3@xmath18 in boxes of 10@xmath710 arcsec ) . to put this data into context",
    ", they are @xmath51.2 mag deeper than the dragonfly images used to explore udgs in coma @xcite and similar to @xcite .",

    "its projected radial separation to this galaxy is 1.3684 degrees .",
    "a redshift independent measurement of the distance to m77 @xcite locates this galaxy at a distance of d=12.3(@xmath31.7 ) mpc . because this is the most massive galaxy of the group , we use its distance as a reliable measurement for the distance of ugc2162 . at that distance ,",
    "the projected radial separation from ugc2162 to m77 is 293.8(@xmath340.6 ) kpc and 1 arcsec corresponds to 60(@xmath38 ) pc .",
    "m77 is the central member of the m77 group .",

    "the hipass survey detects at the position of the galaxy a hi line with a radial velocity peak of 1171.9 km / s ( in agreement with the velocity recession of its optical counterpart : 1175@xmath33 km / s ) . the hi line flux peaks at 0.089 jy and has an integrated hi flux density ( s@xmath19 ) of 5.4 jy km / s",

    "we estimate the inclination using the axis ratio of the 27 mag / arcsec@xmath4 isophote ( g band ) .",
    "this isophote is still bright enough , but sufficiently far away from the central part of the galaxy , to produce a reliable estimation of the shape of its outer disk .",
    "we obtain an axis ratio b / a=0.7 .",
    "this translates into an inclination ( under the assumption of a thin disk ) of @xmath23@xmath545 degrees , and consequently , w=128 km / s .",
    "we assume r@xmath19 to be three times the optical r@xmath25 radius .",
    "for our galaxy , r@xmath25=26 arcsec=1.6(@xmath30.3 ) kpc ( measured in g - band ) . with these values , we estimate m@xmath22=4.6(@xmath30.8)@xmath710@xmath11 m@xmath9 within the inner r@xmath55 kpc .    once a dynamical mass in the inner region of the galaxy has been estimated , it is possible , using the expected cumulative mass curve , to have an estimation of the total virial mass of the dark matter halo .",
    "we follow the same approach as in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "the authors compare the cumulative mass distribution from the eagle simulation @xcite with the observed dynamical mass of their galaxy within a given radius ( see their fig .",

    "to obtain the structural properties of ugc2162 we have used the code imfit @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of the galaxy in each band was modeled using a single srsic component .",
    "the srsic model was convolved with the psf of the image .",
    "the iac stripe82 legacy survey provides , for each band , a psf representative of the local ( 0.5@xmath70.5 deg ) conditions of the image . to have a first estimate of the spatial coordinates of the source , the position angle and the effective radius , we use sextractor .",
    "these values are used later as input parameters for imfit .",
    "in addition , we mask the closest sources surrounding our galaxy ( see fig . [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "we derived the structural parameters of the galaxy in the g , r , and i bands . in all of these bands ,",
    "the structural parameters of the galaxy were very similar .",
    "we obtained r@xmath16=28 arcsec ( which is equivalent to 1.7(@xmath30.2 ) kpc ) .",
    "the central surface brightnesses were @xmath2=24.4@xmath30.1 mag / arcsec@xmath4 , @xmath27=24.2@xmath30.1 mag / arcsec@xmath4 , and @xmath28=24.1@xmath30.1 mag / arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "these values have been corrected for galactic reddening ( 0.117 , 0.081 , and 0.060 in the g , r , and i bands respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "the srsic index in all the bands was around n=0.9 .",
    "the total apparent magnitudes were g=16.1 mag , r=15.9 mag , and i=15.8 mag .    using the global color of the galaxy and its absolute magnitude",
    ", we can have a rough estimate of its stellar mass .",
    "we follow the recipe by @xcite ( assuming a chabrier imf ) , using the g - i color and the absolute magnitude in the r - band ( m@xmath29=-14.6(@xmath30.3 ) mag ) .",
    "we obtain a stellar mass of @xmath52(@xmath6)@xmath710@xmath8 m@xmath9 .",
    "ugc2162 has an sdss spectrum ( plate=1070 ; fiber=450 ; mjd=52591 ) located at the coordinates : r.a.=40.09751 deg and dec=1.22476 deg ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "the spatial location of the sdss spectrum is indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "this region corresponds to the brightest knot of star formation of the galaxy .",
    "this knot has a radius of 1.2 arcsec ( petrosian mag at 90% ) and a magnitude in the r band of only 21.9 mag . using the ratio n2@xmath30[nii]@xmath316583/h@xmath32 from the sdss spectrum and the calibration by @xcite , we have estimated an oxygen abundance for the star - forming ionized gas 12+log(o / h)=8.22@xmath30.07 , which corresponds to one - third of the solar abundance .",
    "the gas of ugc2162 is fairly metallic for its mass and magnitude , since the galaxy is a high - metallicity outlier of the mass - metallicity relation and the magnitude - metallicity relation worked out by @xcite .",
    "we also checked the spectrum for the presence of [ oiii]@xmath314363 , which appears in low metallicity objects ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the line is not in the spectrum , which is consistent with the moderate metallicity inferred from n2 .",
    "since the sdss spectrum is quite noisy , the estimated o abundance should be regarded as an upper limit .    using the h@xmath32 flux ( uncorrected for extinction since h@xmath33 does not seem to be reddened ) , the distance to the source , and the recipe of , we have estimated the sfr and the surface sfr of the bright knot , which turn out to be sfr=8.7(@xmath31.2)@xmath710@xmath34 m@xmath9/yr and @xmath35=3.4(@xmath30.5)@xmath710@xmath36 m@xmath9/yr / kpc@xmath4 .",
    "assuming that the galaxy has 100 such star - forming knots ( reasonable in view of the shape and size of the galaxy ) the total sfr of the galaxy would be sfr=8.7(@xmath31.2)@xmath710@xmath36 m@xmath9/yr .",
    "this value is consistent with the value around 10@xmath17 m@xmath9/yr worked out by @xcite for this object using h@xmath32 imaging . using the above value",
    "we can derive a specific sfr for ugc2162 : ssfr@xmath55(@xmath30.7)@xmath710@xmath37 yr@xmath38 .",
    "if the sfr of ugc2162 were constant , the galaxy would double its stellar mass in @xmath52 gyr .",
    "ugc2162 is currently located at ( a projected separation of ) @xmath5300 kpc from m77 . due to its large amount of hi gas ( @xmath510 times larger than its stellar mass )",
    ", we can speculate that ugc2162 is undergoing its first infall to the m77 galaxy group .",
    "when a galaxy like ugc2162 falls into a group environment , it suffers a number of physical mechanisms that eventually will quench its star formation .",
    "these mechanisms can be either slow ( of the order of a few gigayears ) due to gas strangulation ( see , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or they can be relatively rapid if they are produced by ram pressure stripping ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . following recent simulations @xcite , one can assume that gas rich dwarf galaxies will be depleted of gas 6 gyr after their first infall into typical groups of galaxies ( 10@xmath39 m@xmath9 ) .",
    "motivated by this number , we simulate how our galaxy would look in 6 gyr time if the object were to stop forming stars and followed a passive evolution .",
    "naturally , this is an oversimplification of the actual evolution of the galaxy , but it can be an interesting exercise to understand how our object would look in the future .    to model the color and structural evolution of ugc2162 , we have used its present - day g - r color map and its current g , r , and i surface brightness distributions .",
    "then , we have estimated how every pixel of the images would look if we make their colors evolve passively for 6 gyr . to quantify the color change and the dimming in surface brightness of every pixel",
    ", we have used the @xcite models assuming a kroupa imf .",
    "due to this passive evolution , the galaxy would not only change its global color ( becoming g - i=0.77 ) but would also get dimmer ( by @xmath52.6 mag / arcsec@xmath4 ) .",
    "the result of this evolution is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . after 6 gyr of passive evolution , the galaxy would have @xmath2=27@xmath30.1 mag / arcsec@xmath4 and r@xmath16= 1.8(@xmath30.2 ) kpc .",
    "its profile shape would not change dramatically , and its passively evolved srsic index @xmath40@xmath50.8 would be similar to its original value . with these characteristics ,",
    "the galaxy would resemble closely the faintest udg galaxies discovered so far in the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "in fact , considering the virial mass of ugc2162 , in an eventual future , this galaxy could look very similar to vcc1287 , a very low surface brightness udg galaxy ( @xmath2=26.7 mag / arcsec@xmath4 , r@xmath16= 2.4 kpc , g - i=0.83 , m@xmath13@xmath53@xmath710@xmath8 m@xmath9 ) inhabiting the virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "the structural and stellar population properties of ugc2162 seem to fit very well within a scheme where the udgs found both outside and inside clusters are just different evolutionary stages of the same type of objects @xcite . in this view",
    ", udgs outside clusters would be simply the progenitors of the redder udgs found in rich clusters .",
    "the link between both types of udgs would be an evolution due to the removal of their gas produced by the infall of these galaxies in rich environments . if this picture is correct udgs outside dense environments should be dwarf galaxies with a large hi content .",
    "in fact , low - surface brightness dwarf galaxies with a large amount of hi seem to be fairly common in the field ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . on the contrary ,",
    "those udgs found in the richest environments should be depleted of hi gas due to the removal of this component .",
    "ugc2162 also teaches us an important lesson about udgs and how these objects are observationally selected .",
    "this galaxy has a relatively low stellar mass ( @xmath510@xmath8 m@xmath9 ) compared to the general population of udgs , which peaks at @xmath510@xmath10 m@xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this issue is connected to the way udgs are defined .",
    "udgs are observationally selected using their surface brightness ( @xmath41@xmath4224 mag / arcsec@xmath4 ) and size ( r@xmath16@xmath421.5 kpc ) .",
    "this observational definition immediately biases the selection of the galaxies depending on their stellar populations .",
    "the redder udgs will be more massive and older , whereas the bluer udgs will be younger and with lower stellar mass .",
    "this implies that if one wants to connect the observed udgs with their progenitors or with their descendants , it is important to take this into account .",
    "for instance , most of the progenitors of massive and red udgs found in rich clusters would not satisfy the observational criteria to be classified as udgs .",
    "these progenitors would have central surface brightnesses brighter than @xmath41@xmath4324 mag / arcsec@xmath4 and would have been classified as regular ( blue ) dwarf galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "those blue udgs that have been discovered outside clusters ( as is the case of ugc2162 ) would evolve into the less massive ( and red ) udgs found in rich clusters ( as is the case of vcc1287 ) . accounting for this selection effect in selecting udgs is key to have a comprehensive picture about the nature of these objects and how to connect their different evolutionary stages .",
    "ugc2162 has many of the structural and stellar population properties expected if the large size of this galaxy is the result of feedback - driven gas outflows @xcite .",
    "for instance , ugc2162 has a large amount of hi gas and it is currently forming stars as the cosmological simulations predicted .",
    "in addition , @xcite simulations are able to predict the dwarf - like halo mass of this galaxy , as well as its stellar mass , gas mass , srsic index , effective radius , absolute magnitude , sfr , irregular appearance , and off - center - star formation episodes . according to these simulations",
    ", these galaxies would not be at all rare and they will be found in abundance outside clusters .",
    "in fact , many of these have already been detected @xcite in low density environments .",
    "if the picture sketched by the cosmological simulations is correct , a large number of the descendants of udgs found in low density environments would be found in rich clusters having the following characteristics : m@xmath44@xmath4510@xmath8 m@xmath9 , @xmath2@xmath4527 mag / arcsec@xmath4 , r@xmath16@xmath421.5 kpc , n@xmath461 , g - i@xmath50.8 and low hi gas content .",
    "these objects would be hard to find even for current deep surveys .",
    "in fact , udgs with @xmath2@xmath4527 mag / arcsec@xmath4 have only be reported by @xcite , while the remaining udgs found in rich clusters have all been found with @xmath2@xmath1527 mag / arcsec@xmath4 .",
    "the existence of a large number of `` dark '' m@xmath44@xmath510@xmath8 m@xmath9 extended galaxies in rich clusters is a natural prediction of cosmological simulations if the above evolutionary picture for the udgs is correct .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that there are a number of extremely low - surface brightness galaxies at a distance closer than ugc2162 that technically satisfy the criteria to be considered udgs ( i.e. r@xmath16@xmath421.5 kpc and @xmath41@xmath4224 mag / arcsec@xmath4 ) .",
    "these objects are : a ) a satellite of m31 , andromeda xix ( r@xmath16@xmath421.7 kpc and @xmath41=29.3 mag / arcsec@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , b ) a satellite of our own galaxy , the sagittarius dwarf ( r@xmath16=1.6 kpc and @xmath41=25.2 mag / arcsec@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "andromeda xix has a very low mass ( m@xmath47=-9.3 and @xmath18=4.7 km / s ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it is significantly less massive than the population of udgs that has been discussed in the literature ( which are a factor of @xmath5100 times more massive ) . for this reason , and xix can not be considered to be representative of the population of udgs originally discovered in the coma cluster .",
    "in fact , at that distance , the object would appear invisible in present - day surveys .",
    "@xcite discuss the possibility that the and xix large extention could be produced by the gravitational tides of m31 .",
    "the other two galaxies ( though with stellar masses around 10@xmath8 m@xmath9 or larger ) are being tidally disrupted . in this sense ,",
    "their large effective radii are a consequence of the ongoing disruption process .",
    "compared to the previous objects , the fact that ugc2162 has a gas reservoir is strong evidence that it is not diffuse and extended because it is being tidally disrupted .",
    "for this reason , ugc2162 is currently the nearest not tidally disrupted udg known , whose large size is probably due to an internal origin alone .",

    "<S> this galaxy , located at a distance of 12.3(@xmath31.7 ) mpc , is a member of the m77 group . </S>",
    "<S> ugc2162 has a stellar mass of @xmath52(@xmath6)@xmath710@xmath8 m@xmath9 and is embedded within a cloud of hi gas @xmath510 times more massive : @xmath51.9(@xmath30.6)@xmath710@xmath10 m@xmath9 . using the width of its hi line as a dynamical proxy , the enclosed mass within the inner r@xmath55 kpc is @xmath54.6(@xmath30.8)@xmath710@xmath11 m@xmath9 ( i.e. m / l@xmath5200 ) . </S>",

    "<S> ultra - deep imaging from the iac stripe82 legacy project show that the galaxy is irregular and has many star forming knots , with a gas - phase metallicity around one - third of the solar value . </S>",
    "<S> its estimated star formation rate ( sfr ) is @xmath50.01 m@xmath9/yr . </S>",
    "<S> this sfr would double the stellar mass of the object in @xmath52 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> if the object were to stop forming stars at this moment , after a passive evolution , its surface brightness would become extremely faint : @xmath2@xmath527 mag / arcsec@xmath4 and its size would remain large r@xmath0@xmath5 1.8 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> such faintness would make it almost undetectable to most present - day surveys . </S>",
