    "the discovery of neutrino oscillation events in superkamiokande experiments  @xcite has stimulated us to reconsider the fermion mass hierarchy problem in unified theories .",
    "one of the most mysterious problems is the remarkable contrast of the mixing structure of leptons to that of quarks .",
    "most of us believe in the possible unification of the existing matter content observed in the low energy region and that the realization of a grand unified theory ( gut ) is one of the most challenging problems in particle physics . in this sense ,",
    "the experimental data  @xcite-@xcite indicating a large mixing of the muon neutrino provides us with an important clue in pursuing unification and many authors have investigated neutrino physics along this line  @xcite .",
    "the existence of right - handed neutrinos suggests a left - right symmetric gauge group which is beyond the @xmath1 group  @xcite , in which all fermions of one generation are combined into a single representation * 16*. in this sense , @xmath6  @xcite would be an attractive candidate for the unified gauge group .",
    "however , the characteristic feature of the neutrino mixing structure seems to suggest that such @xmath6 unifications are unfeasible they would give rise to a complete parallelism between quarks and leptons .    among the possible simple gauge groups ,",
    "@xmath0  @xcite is essentially the unique candidate for the unified gauge group . indeed ,",
    "if one requires the following three conditions for the unified group , only @xmath6 and @xmath0 remain : ( i ) all the fermions , including the right - handed neutrinos of one family , belong to a single irreducible representation ; ( ii ) the group is automatically anomaly free ; and ( iii ) the group allows complex representations that contain our low - energy chiral fermions but not their mirror fermions .",
    "if we further add the condition that ( iv ) there exists freedom in the fermion content to avoid the parallelism between the quark and lepton mass structures , then we are left with only the @xmath0 gauge group .",
    "most remarkably , one of characteristic features of the @xmath0 group is that we have a freedom in choosing the down quark and charged lepton components in the fundamental representation * 27*.    our final goal is to unify all the fermions of three generations , but before realizing that , we should understand the difference between the mixing structures of the quark and lepton sectors .",
    "this is closely connected with the origin of the hierarchical structure of fermion masses .",
    "there have been various approaches to these problems , and to this time , most of them either take _ ad hoc _ employ for hierarchical yukawa couplings or assume certain family symmetries . among the latter approaches , which we expect to open a gate for understanding the origin of generation , the simplest one may be to use a flavor @xmath7 symmetry  @xcite . in that case , the smallness of the yukawa couplings are attributed to the higher - dimensional interaction terms suppressed by some fundamental scale @xmath8 .    in a previous paper  @xcite , the authors constructed a supersymmetric @xmath0 unified model with an extra @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "there we showed that e - twisting family structure can reproduce all the characteristic features of the fermion mass matrices , not only the quark / lepton dirac masses but also the neutrino majorana masses .",
    "despite the fact that a common @xmath7 charge is assigned to all members in a * 27 * of each generation , the model explained the qualitative features of the different mass hierarchies among generations for up and down quark sectors , as well as the mixing angles for quarks and for leptons .    in this paper , we study this model more quantitatively and aim to check whether the resultant predictions are consistent with the present experimental results . to complete our scenario",
    ", we have to introduce a new higgs field in order to allow for a difference between the quark and lepton masses and mixings .",
    "a minimal choice is to introduce a higgs field of the adjoint representation * 78*. this higgs field is actually necessary also in order to break the @xmath0 gauge symmetry down to the standard gauge group @xmath9 .",
    "this is because there is no component in the fundamental representation ( * 27 * ) that is non - singlet under the @xmath1 symmetry but singlet under the standard gauge group .",
    "in fact , with a particular assumption for the higgs potential , the adjoint representation higgs can cause the desired symmetry breaking even with the doublet - triplet splitting  @xcite .",
    "the newly introduced higgs field also induces effective yukawa couplings which come from the higher - dimensional interaction terms via the froggatt - nielsen mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it is found that such ( non - leading ) contributions can actually lead to differences between the quarks and leptons as well as between the up and down quarks .",
    "we analyze the masses and mixing angles by taking account of this additional higgs field and find several interesting parameter - independent relations among the experimental observables , including a large lepton mixing angle .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we first present the field content and the charge assignments in our model with e - twisting family structure by adding a higgs field * 78*. we also explicitly list the induced higher - dimensional terms involving the * 78 * field .",
    "the structure of the additional couplings is analyzed in section 3 .",
    "we show how this contribution affects the quark and lepton yukawa couplings in the following two sections . in section 6",
    "we carry out both the analytic and numerical analyses to compare the results with the present experimental data . in spite of the complicated forms of the yukawa matrices",
    ", we can find interesting relations between the quark and lepton mixing angles . in section 7",
    "we give summarizing discussion and further comments .",
    "the appendix is devoted to describing the diagonalization of the @xmath10 mass matrices of the type appearing in the text .",
    "the supersymmetric @xmath0 unification model that was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite contains , in addition to an @xmath0 gauge vector multiplet , chiral matter multiplets corresponding to the three generation fermions ( @xmath11 @xmath12 ) and two pairs of higgs fields ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) and ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) .",
    "the former higgs , @xmath13 , is for the electroweak symmetry breaking ( also for the fermion masses ) and the other , @xmath15 , is responsible for realizing the e - twisting ( generation flipping ) structure . in this paper",

    "the @xmath7 flavor symmetry discriminates generations and induces a hierarchy among them .",
    "it should be noted that all the quarks and leptons in one generation have a common @xmath7 quantum numbers .",
    "since we are interested in the mass terms of the ordinary fermions as well as superheavy fermions of the gut scale , we list all the superpotentials which are invariant under @xmath20 parity , @xmath7 and @xmath0 and give masses of matter superfields @xmath21 .",

    "the coupling constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 are assumed to be order 1 .",
    "however , the effective yukawa coupling constants become multiplied by additional powers of @xmath27 coming , from the powers of @xmath18 required by @xmath7 quantum number matching ( the froggatt - nielsen mechanism ) .",
    "we assume throughout this work that @xmath28 is of the order of the cabibbo angle @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "we also suppose that only the @xmath30 doublet components of @xmath13 can have the electroweak scale vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .    with the adjoint higgs field",
    "@xmath31 having @xmath7 charge @xmath32 , there is the following higher - dimensional operator which eventually give small mass terms : @xmath33 here , @xmath34 are order 1 couplings . precisely speaking , there are two ways for contracting the @xmath0 group indices in this superpotential , which we will discuss in detail in the next section .",
    "there also exist the following higher - dimensional operators , which give rise to the right - handed neutrino majorana masses : @xmath35 here @xmath36 represents @xmath37 or @xmath38 with @xmath7 charge @xmath39 , and the couplings @xmath40 are of order 1",

    "it is due to this doubling that we have the freedom to choose the low - energy @xmath2 candidates .",
    "this actually implies that the embedding of @xmath6 into @xmath0 , such that @xmath52 with georgi - glashow @xmath53 , possesses a freedom of rotation of @xmath54 .",

    "@xcite : ( i ) parallel family structure ; ( ii ) non - parallel family structure ; and ( iii ) e - twisted structure . among these three possibilities ,",
    "we here investigate the simplest and probably most attractive option , namely the e - twisted structure : @xmath58 this structure implies that the third family @xmath2 falls into @xmath50 of @xmath6 , which is e - twisted from that of the other two families .",

    "( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "in addition to this , we need also write down the form of the coupling ( [ zyukawa ] ) at the component level .",
    "the full effective mass matrices for the quarks and leptons are the sums of the contributions from direct yukawa couplings ( [ yukawa ] ) and the induced ones from the higher - dimensional couplings ( [ zyukawa ] ) . since the explicit forms of the tree - level yukawa couplings have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we here present those of eq .  ( [ zyukawa ] ) in the next section .",
    "in this section we present the precise form of the higher - dimensional interaction ( [ zyukawa ] ) containing the adjoint higgs @xmath17 and give the explicit component expressions for the effective yukawa couplings induced by the vevs of @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath0 adjoint @xmath17 is decomposed as follows under the subgroup @xmath69 : @xmath70 then , @xmath71 is further decomposed under @xmath72 into @xmath73 among which the components of @xmath74 and the @xmath75 singlet part of @xmath76 are neutral under the standard gauge symmetry . if @xmath54 is broken by the vev of the neutral components of @xmath77 , @xmath78 and/or @xmath79 , this can create differences between the up and down quark sectors .",
    "however , it turns out that @xmath78 and @xmath79 do not yield sufficiently large differences .",
    "thus we here assume that only the third component @xmath80 of @xmath81 develops a non - vanishing vev @xmath82 , normalized by @xmath83 for later convenience ( see ( [ 78vev ] ) ) . since we also wish to have differences between the down quarks and charged leptons ( especially in the second generation ) , we assume that the @xmath54 singlet @xmath84 in @xmath74 and the @xmath75 singlet @xmath85 in @xmath76 develop non - vanishing vevs @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( normalized by @xmath83 ) , respectively . retaining only these three vevs , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath82 , we have @xmath88 ( for a proper normalization of generators , @xmath82 and @xmath89",

    "the second term coupling @xmath96 , on the other hand , need not have definite symmetry . however , we can always redefine it to become anti - symmetric through the following procedure . since @xmath97 is equivalent to the generator of the @xmath0 group",

    "the above two types of couplings in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) in fact correspond to the two independent couplings through the representations * 27 * and * 351 * contained in the product @xmath99 , which are contracted with their complex conjugate representations in @xmath100 .",
    "we can thus see that the second term in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) , with antisymmetric coupling constant @xmath96 , is equivalent to the antisymmetric coupling @xmath101 .",
    "however , writing this coupling as in eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) is more convenient .",
    "this is because the action of @xmath17 on @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) in the product @xmath104 is the same as that of the @xmath0 generators .",
    "moreover , the components in @xmath17 possessing the above non - vanishing vevs , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath82 , correspond to the cartan generators @xmath105 respectively , so that @xmath106 is equivalent to the replacement of each component field in @xmath102 by the same field multiplied by its @xmath107 and @xmath108 quantum numbers and the corresponding vevs , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath82 . thus the effective yukawa couplings that result from eq .",
