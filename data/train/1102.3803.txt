    "a satisfying _ quantum gravity theory _ does not exist yet and the enormous gap of @xmath0 orders of magnitude between the predicted theoretical value of the cosmological constant and the observed one has not yet found a compelling explanation . if the quantum description of nature is appropriate for every force , it should be applicable even to the gravitational force described by general relativity .",
    "but perhaps , general relativity as it stands , requires a change in this respect , various proposals on how the fundamental aspects of special relativity can be modified at very high energies have been done . among these proposals ,",
    "particularly promising appears to be the one known as _ doubly special relativity _",

    "were minted for flat space . however , nothing forbids to consider a curved background and therefore to enter into the realm of general relativity . from this point of view , magueijo and smolin@xcite",
    "proposed that the energy - momentum tensor and the einstein s field equations were modified with the introduction of a one parameter family of equations@xmath6 where @xmath7 is an energy dependent newton s constant , defined so that @xmath8 is the low - energy newton s constant .",
    "similarly we have an energy dependent cosmological constant @xmath9 leading to the _ rainbow _ version of the schwarzschild line element@xmath10 since the functions @xmath3 and @xmath11 come into play when the energy @xmath12 is comparable with @xmath13 , it is likely that they modify the uv behavior in the same way as generalized uncertainty principle and noncommutative geometry ( ncg ) do , respectively . if the effect of generalized uncertainty principle and ncg is to modify the liouville measure @xmath14 from one side , * * and to introduce a granularity from the other side , the _ rainbow metric _",
    "@xmath15 should be able to introduce a natural uv regulator hidden into the arbitrary _ _ functions @xmath16 and @xmath4 .",
    "an encouraging partial answer has been obtained in ref.@xcite , where an application of rainbow s gravity to black hole entropy computation has been considered . in that paper",
    "the uv regulator , namely the _ brick wall , _ has been eliminated with the help of the following choice of @xmath16 and @xmath4@xmath17 an interesting test to see _",

    "nevertheless , we have to remark that any computation of zpe leads to a regularization and subsequently to a renormalization process in order to have finite physical quantities",
    ". therefore the purpose of the paper is to show that with the introduction of appropriate rainbow s gravity functions it is possible to overpass the renormalization problem .",
    "of course this proposal does not represent a complete cure to have a finite theory of quantum gravity but rather it suggests how the modification of some basic principles like the introduction of an energy dependent metric can lead to unexpected results such as the avoidance of a renormalization scheme . in ordinary gravity the computation of zpe for quantum fluctuations of the _ pure gravitational field _ can be extracted by rewriting the wheeler - dewitt equation ( wdw)@xcite in a form which looks like an expectation value computation@xcite .",

    "the choice of a gaussian wave functional is justified by the fact that zpe should be described by a good candidate of the _ vacuum state_. to fix the ideas , a variant of the line element @xmath15 will be considered@xmath35 where @xmath36 is the lapse function and @xmath37 is subject to the only condition @xmath38 .",

    "motivated by the promising results obtained in the application of gravity s rainbow to black hole entropy computation@xcite and , on the other side in ncg application of zpe evaluation@xcite , in this paper we have considered how gravity s rainbow influences the uv behavior of zpe .",
    "we have found that , due to the arbitrariness of @xmath3 and @xmath4 , it is always possible to find a form of the rainbow functions in such a way the expression in @xmath270 be uv finite .",
    "as introduced in ref.@xcite , the finite result @xmath192 is interpreted as an induced cosmological constant but without a regularization and a renormalization to keep under control the uv divergences . to fix ideas we have used gaussian regulators . in this way",
    "our approach is directly comparable to ncg .",
    "the first evident difference is that in ncg the regulator comes into play into the counting of nodes , while in gravity s rainbow appear in both the sum over eigenvalues and in the counting of nodes .",
    "if one fixes the attention on the pure gaussian regulator one discovers that the zpe is always negative for gravity s rainbow .",
    "this unpleasant feature can be corrected with the introduction of a polynomial with real arbitrary coefficients like in eq.@xmath188 . by imposing the positivity of the result for every @xmath271 we find that , in case condition @xmath272 be satisfied , the parametrization @xmath217 is sufficient to guarantee that @xmath273 as shown in fig.[fig3 ] . on the other hand , when condition @xmath139 is satisfied we need two different parametrizations to guarantee a correct behavior of @xmath192 for @xmath274 and most importantly a point of connection where a smooth transition can happen as shown in parametrization @xmath229 and in fig.[fig2 ] . in summary ,",
    "the final plot becomes     as a function of the scale invariant @xmath119 for values of the parameters given by eq.@xmath229 .",
    "the plot shows that the minkowski limit is satisfied at the boundaries of the range @xmath275 .",
    "both limits are approached maintaining a positive @xmath268 the undesired part of the plot has been eliminated to visualize the global behavior.,width=364 ]    note that the transition clearly highlights that we need two metrics with the same background @xmath37 but with two different choices of @xmath3 and @xmath276 . of course this transition happens because we insist to have positivity and a vanishing behavior at the boundary of the range @xmath277 .",
    "the vanishing behavior for small @xmath119 is a guarantee that the minkowski limit is reproduced .",
    "note that the reproduction of a minkowski limit in ncg ( i.e. the @xmath278 limit ) is less trivial because of the existence of the ir / uv mixing@xcite .",
    "it also appears that the case @xmath193 seems to be special because it is the only one that has a positive @xmath192 for @xmath274 when condition @xmath241 is satisfied .",
    "we can focus our attention on this case and suppose to consider the de sitter background which is the static representation of the friedmann - robertson - walker model . for this choice , the shape function @xmath37 is@xmath279 and the effective masses @xmath280 become on the cosmological throat @xmath281@xmath282 since the behavior of @xmath192 for the de sitter universe",
    "is described by fig.[fig2 ] , we can compare our results with observation .",
    "since @xmath192 represents the observed cosmological constant induced by quantum fluctuations of the pure gravitational field , we can fix its value at the present day as@xmath283 which can be described either for @xmath284 or @xmath285 .",
    "however , for the de sitter case @xmath286 and @xmath284 means @xmath287 which is in agreement with our present universe . on the other hand , when @xmath285 means that @xmath288 which could be in agreement with the very early universe except for the disagreement with the expected theoretical prediction which for our plot in units of @xmath289 should be @xmath290 .",
    "therefore it appears that only the left branch of fig.[fig2 ] from the bottom to the hilltop can be interpreted as a sort of a _ backward evolution _  in the radial coordinate @xmath291 .",
    "however to follow the curve from @xmath292 to @xmath293 one should have a variable @xmath294 , namely @xmath295 .",
    "the same situation appears to exist for minkowski space in radial coordinates and for the ads space .",
    "fortunately , minkowski space has no a preferred scale and fig.[fig2 ] has the correct asymptotic behavior except for an unpleasant peak in correspondence of the peak location of the ds space .",
    "it is likely that this spurious prediction is due to the coordinate choice . on",
    "the other side one can verify that @xmath296 when @xmath297 for both minkowski , ds and ads spaces .",
    "coming back on the ads space , we have to note that this background is not endowed of a horizon and therefore it makes difficult to find a significant point .",
    "nevertheless looking once again fig.[fig2 ] , we can claim that for @xmath298 and very small @xmath299 one gets@xmath300 namely a vanishing @xmath192 , while in the other regime , i.e. @xmath297 , @xmath213 and once again one obtains a vanishing @xmath192 that it means that against all odds , we have regularity on the singularity @xmath301 .",
