    "massive stars evolve rapidly and can explode not far from the dense clouds that were their birthplaces .",
    "the resulting supernova remnants ( snrs ) thus are expected to be in the vicinity of , and to interact with , molecular and/or  clouds .",
    "such interactions may account for the characteristics of the thermal composite ( or mixed - morphology ) snrs , which radiate bright thermal x - ray emission interior to their radio shells and have faint x - ray rims ( green et al .",
    "1997 ; rho & petre 1998 ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the x - ray morphology of the thermal composites .",
    "these include ( 1 ) a radiatively cooled rim and a hot interior ( e.g. , harrus et al .",
    "1997 ; rho & petre 1998 ) , ( 2 ) a hot interior with density increased by thermal conduction ( cox et al .  1999 ; shelton et al .",
    "1999 ) , ( 3 ) an increase in internal gas density due to evaporation of the engulfed cloudlets ( white & long 1991 ) , and ( 4 ) shock interaction at the edge of a cloud but seen brightened in the projected interior ( petruk 2001 ; as summarized in , e.g. , chen et al .",
    "recently , shelton et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have explained the x - ray properties of snr  w44 by invoking thermal conduction and bright metal emission due to dust destruction and ejecta enrichment in the interior .",
    "also , a study based on ionization states of hot interior plasma suggests that the thermal composite ( or mixed - morphology ) phenomenon may be an evolutionary state of snrs due to thermal conduction ( kawasaki et al .",
    "the sample comprised six thermal composites including , which is the subject of this paper .    in none of these mechanisms",
    "has the influence of the supernova progenitor on the surrounding medium been considered .",
    "massive stars may sculpt a cavity with their energetic stellar winds and ionizing radiation before they explode as core - collapse supernovae .",
    "the observational effect of the snr s blast wave impacting the cavity wall should be of particular interest .",
    "after almost free expansion in the cavity , the blast wave will `` reflect '' from the cavity wall and a strong reverse shock will heat the interior material .",
    "thus , a particularly x - ray bright interior may be expected in this scenario , as we will outline for the case of .",

    "( seward 1990 ) , _ rosat _  ( seward et al .  1996 ) , and _ asca _  ( enoguchi et al .  2002 ) , it appears prominently brightened in the center , especially along an inner , broken ring .",
    "this is different from most other thermal composites , which are centrally - peaked in x - rays . in the radio band ( kesteven & caswell 1987 ; whiteoak & green 1996 ) there is a clear - cut rim , except in the southwest .",
    "the radio emission is brightest in the east , with the surface brightness peaking near the southeastern border , where the blast wave may be striking a dense cloud .",
    "the radio emission gradually fades toward the southwest , where the remnant seems to break out to a lower density region .",
    "it was noted that the radio image displays multiple arcs centered on the eastern half , from which a series of arclike shells may have emanated ( milne et al .",
    "1989 ) .",
    "although oh masers , which usually mark shock interaction with molecular clouds , are not detected in  ( unlike other thermal composites such as 3c  391 , w28 , and w44 ) ( green et al .",
    "1997 ) , this snr is found to be embedded in an cloud complex at a local standard of rest velocity of @xmath1 .",
    "there is an  ridge or shell just exterior to the rim , delineated by the radio continuum contours , except on the west and southwest sides ( mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "mcclure - griffiths et al.suggest that this confirms that the remnant shock is impacting a density enhancement from the inner void .",
    "the  observation provides a dynamical distance estimate of @xmath2 , on the far side of the scutum - crux arm .",
    "in this paper , we take this value as a reference for the distance : @xmath3 .",
    "we present a spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopic study of the remnant using a _ chandra _  acis - i observation . in   2 , we briefly describe the observation and data calibration and present our analysis and results .",

    "after removing flares with count rates greater than 1.2 times the mean light - curve value , a net exposure of 37 ks remained and was used for analysis .",
    "a major goal of this observation was to search for an internal compact object .",
    "there is obviously no bright crab - like pulsar or pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) within kes 27 .",
    "however , less energetic psr / pwn examples have been observed in many other remnants , for example , ic  443 ( 1.5 kpc distant ) and the vela snr ( 0.25 kpc distant ) ( olbert et al .",
    "2001 ; helfand et al .",
    "upper limits can be set for these types of pwne .",
    "if moved to the more distant kes 27 , the ic 443 pwn ( @xmath6 ergs s@xmath7 , @xmath8 in extent ) would appear as a @xmath9 patch in the 28 kev x - ray band , with strength @xmath10 counts ks@xmath7 .",
    "we can set an upper limit of 1 count ks@xmath7 for an object of this size in the interior of kes 27 , so @xmath11 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "similar reasoning for the vela pwn ( @xmath12 in diameter , @xmath13 ) predicts 7 counts ks@xmath7 from a @xmath14 region . in this case",
    "we can set an upper limit of 0.5 counts ks@xmath7 , corresponding to @xmath15 ergs s@xmath7 .",
    "note that an upper limit depends strongly on the size of the object .",
    "leahy ( 2004 ) has suggested that the psr / pwn within the ic 443 boundary is really associated with the nearer remnant g189.6 + 3.3 .",
    "although this would reduce its luminosity to about one - quarter of that quoted above , our upper limit does not change .    the thermal composite remnant kes 79 ( 7 kpc distant ) contains an unresolved central compact object ( cco ) with @xmath16 ergs s@xmath7 ( seward et al .",
    "the spectrum is soft , but since absorption is comparable in the two remnants , if this object were in kes 27 , we would expect 40 counts ks@xmath7 , twice as bright as the brightest observed unresolved source .",

    "the sedov model fit yields an ionization timescale @xmath205 , which implies a dynamical age @xmath206 ( where we have assumed that the preshock density is similar to the mean interior density @xmath104 ) .",
    "this is similar to the above sedov age . on the other hand , the upper limit on the mean ionization timescale derived with the _ vpshock _ model ( table  [ t : ent_spec ] )",
    "gives an age @xmath207 .",
    "this is similar to the ionization age ( @xmath208 ) found in the _ asca _  x - ray study ( enoguchi et al .  2002 ) and is comparable to the remnant s radiative cooling timescale , @xmath209^{-0.52}{\\,{\\rm yr}}$ ] , where @xmath210 is the snr s explosion energy in units of @xmath211 and @xmath212 is the preshock density ( falle 1981 ) . in this case",
    "the postshock temperature would be @xmath213 and thus the gas would be x - ray  faint .",
    "this does not agree with the postshock temperatures derived from the spectral fits and the fact that the eastern rim of the snr is x - ray  bright .",
    "a possibility to reconcile the different estimates might be for the x - ray emitting gas to have a very low filling factor , @xmath214 , but this seems unlikely .",
    "the mass of the x - ray  emitting gas , @xmath215 , suggests that the snr is not in the free - expansion phase and is probably dominated by the swept - up ambient medium .",
    "even so , kes  27 appears to be enriched in s and ca , and this is not a unique case .",
    "one sample of 23 thermal composite ( or mixed - morphology ) snrs showed that 10 of them to be detected as metal - enhanced ( lazendic & slane 2006 ) . the contribution of supernova ejecta has been suggested to be the cause of both the elevated metal abundances and the x - ray brightening in the central regions .",
    "for example , the overabundant mg , si , and ( possibly ) s in thermal composite snr  g290.1@xmath2160.8 ( slane et al .  2002 ) and the ne , si , and s enhancement in w44 are ascribed to supernova ejecta ( shelton et al .",
    "2004 ) .    environments of nonuniform density are often seen around snrs , especially those adjacent to dense clouds .",
    "this sometimes is consistent with systematic variation of the intervening hydrogen column density along the line of sight to the snr , as for 3c  391 ( chen et al .",
    "2004 ) and 3c  397 ( safi - harb et al .",
    "s hi density enhancement is found to the east of the remnant ( mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the spitzer irac 8  @xmath217 m observation ( reach et al .",
    "2006 ) shows a large - scale environment with a density gradient increasing from west to east .",
    "however , our x - ray study of  does not show a clear trend of @xmath69 ( and spectral ) variations along the density gradient ( although e1 is the only region showing a significantly higher value ; table  [ t : xspec ] ) .",
    "this may indicate that the environmental hydrogen column density may take only a very low fraction in the intervening interstellar column ( @xmath218 ) , either because the cloud complex in the vicinity is not very compact or bacause it is not very large .",
    "the double x - ray rings are not expected in either the cloud evaporation or the thermal conduction model . in the latter ( cox et al .",
    "1999 ; shelton et al .",
    "1999 ) , thermal conduction in the remnant smooths out the temperature gradient from the hot interior to the cooler shell and increases the central density , resulting in luminous x - rays in the interior ; this effect is dominant in the radiative stage .",
    "this model predicts a centrally peaked x - ray surface brightness for the snr and , usually , a high ionization timescale for the hot gas , inconsistent with our observation .",
    "the cloud evaporation model ( white & long 1991 ) suggests that when an snr expands in an inhomogeneous interstellar medium whose mass is mostly contained in small clouds , the clouds engulfed by the blast wave can be evaporated to slowly increase the density of the interior hot gas ; as a result , the snr appears internally x - ray  brightened .",
    "this model can reproduce an x - ray ",
    "bright inner ring like that in the northeastern half of  and can also reproduce a fading - out radial surface brightness profile like that in the southwestern half ( see fig.[f : rp ] ) .",
    "a representative fit to the inner ring s brightness profile using the cloud evaporation model requires the ratio of the cloud evaporation timescale to the snr s age to be @xmath219 and the ratio of the mass of the cloudlets to the mass of the intercloud medium to be @xmath220 .",
    "the fit is not unique , and combinations of @xmath22112 and @xmath22260 produce similar profiles ( relatively scaled to match the maximum brightness ) .",
    "a representative fit to the southwest radial brightness profile would need @xmath223 ( 1525 ) and @xmath224 ( 4570 ) .",
    "however , the generally higher inner gas temperature as compared with the outer region is not expected for such high @xmath225- and @xmath226-values in the evaporation model",
    ". moreover , this model overestimates the surface brightness inside the inner ring and can not reproduce the outer x - ray ring in the northeast .",
    "it also can not naturally explain why the physical conditions exemplified by the parameters @xmath225 and @xmath226 should be different in the two halves and why there are not two rings in the southwestern half , in contrast to the northeastern .",
    "another scenario is required to account for the unusual x - ray morphology of , which is different from that of other thermal composite remnants .",
    "actually , the explanation must be consistent with the following facts : ( 1 ) the large - scale environment around  has a density gradient increasing from west to east , as revealed in the infrared ( reach et al .",
    "( 2 ) as sketched in figure  [ f : diagram ] , the remnant is surrounded by a `` crocodile s mouth''like  shell ( mcclure - griffiths et al .",
    "( 3 ) in x - rays , the remnant is brightened in the northeastern half and fades out to the southwestern low - density region .",
    "( 4 ) the inner and outer x - ray arcs are both located in the northeastern half , where the ambient medium is denser than in the southwest . ( 5 ) the outer arc is in contact with the  shell . ( 6 ) the inner arc is hotter than the outer arc . ( 7 ) as noted by enoguchi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the radio polarization observed by milne et al .",
    "( 1989 ) is strong in both the eastern rim and the center .",
    "we suggest that both the outer and inner arcs represent shock waves , propagating outward and inward , respectively . the observed polarization in the eastern rim and the center is due to shocked and compressed matter in the two arcs .",
    "the present inward shock is not the initial reverse shock caused by expansion into low - density circumstellar material .",
    "the remnant is middle - aged , and this has long passed ( mckee 1974 ) .",
    "the present inward shock is a reverse shock due to the distant hi shell .",
    "a comprehensive scenario is as follows : the massive progenitor exploded in a cavity excavated by the strong stellar wind and ionizing radiation . because of the density gradient in the environmental medium , the wind cavity had a small radius in the east and a large radius in the west , or",
    "may even not have been confined in the west .",
    "after the supernova explosion , in the west and southwest , the blast wave propagated into a low - density medium , and the x - ray emission is faint . in the north and east",
    ", the blast wave has hit the cavity wall .",
    "a transmitted shock is now propagating into the dense wall , and a reflected shock is traveling back toward the remnant s center , shocking the supernova ejecta to higher temperature .",
    "the outer arc contains gas heated by the transmitted shock , and the inner arc is the interior metal - enriched gas heated by the reflected shock ( see again fig .",
    "[ f : diagram ] ) .",
    "shock - heated s atoms in the compressed inner arc emit a strong he@xmath48 line .",
    "chen et al .  (",
    "2003 ) considered a thin - shell model for a blast shock hitting a wind - cavity wall but did not include shock reflections .",
    "dwarkadas ( 2005 , 2007 ) simulated shocks reflected back from a cavity wall , and a picture of shock reflection and transmission similar to what is seen in  was predicted . to capture the essential physics essence",
    ", we use the theory of reflected shocks described by sgro ( 1975 ) to estimate some relevant parameters . for a shock reflected by a dense wall ,",
    "the temperature ratio between the post  reflected - shock gas and post  transmitted - shock gas is given by @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the density contrast between the post  reflected - shock gas and post  incident - shock gas and @xmath229 is the wall - to - cavity density contrast , which is related to @xmath228 as @xmath230^{1/2}-\\sqrt{5}(a_r-1)\\}^2}.\\ ] ] the pressure ratio of the post  transmitted - shock gas to the post  incident - shock gas is @xmath231 using these equations , we plot the functional relations of @xmath232 , @xmath228 , and @xmath233 with @xmath229 in figure  [ f : refl_shock ] .",
    "regions e2 versus c1 and n versus c2 represent two pairs of transmitted versus reflected shocks .",
    "the ranges of the temperature ratios obtained from table  [ t : xspec ] are shown in figure  [ f : refl_shock ] . because there is a large scatter in the fitted temperatures , there are large uncertainties in the wall - to - cavity density @xmath229 , which seems to be @xmath55 2 .",
    "the density contrast between the post  reflected - shock gas and postincident shock gas @xmath228 is around 1.3 .",
    "if regions w1 , w2 , and s can be taken as roughly indicative of a post  incident - shock gas density @xmath234 ( table  [ t : xspec ] ) , then the post  reflected shock density @xmath235 in c1 and c2 is consistent with the values of @xmath228 ( although this estimate is crude , because the filling factor @xmath106 may vary from region to region ) .",
    "such a reflected shock launched from the cavity wall is consistent with the observed properties of . as the remnant continues to age",
    ", the transmitted shock in the dense medium will become fainter in x - rays , while the reflected shock will converge in the center , producing a truly centrally x - ray  brightened morphology .",
    "the reflection of shocks is thus another mechanism that may produce thermal composite remnants .",
    "we have observed the thermal composite snr  with the acis - i detectors on _ chandra _  and performed a spatially resolved spectroscopic study of the remnant .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows .    1 .",
    "we have detected 30 pointlike x - ray sources superposed on the remnant , with s / n@xmath20 .",

    "calcium is also over - abundant in the remnant .",
    "the hot gas in the remnant is essentially close to ionization equilibrium ( except for that along the eastern rim ) .",
    "images of the remnant show previously unseen double x - ray arc structures .",
    "there is an outer x - ray arc and an inner , harder , concentric arc .",
    "these two shell - like features are located in the northeastern half of the remnant , and the x - ray surface brightness fades away with increasing radius to the southwest .",
    "the x - ray intensity peak coincides with the radio - bright region along the eastern border .",
    "the gas in the inner region is at higher temperature .",
    "4 .   the overall morphology can be explained by the evolution of the remnant in an ambient medium with a density gradient increasing from west to east .",
    "the remnant was probably born in a preexisting cavity created by the progenitor star .",
    "the outer shock has hit the cavity wall and is now in the denser wall material , and the inner arc indicates gas heated by a reflected shock .",

    "<S> there are over 30 unresolved sources within the remnant . </S>",
    "<S> none shows characteristics typical of a young neutron star . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum diffuse x - ray intensity coincides with a radio - bright region along the eastern border . in general , gas in the inner region </S>",
    "<S> is at higher temperature , and the emission is brighter , than that in the outer region . </S>",
    "<S> the gas in the remnant appears to be near ionization equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the overall morphology can be explained by the evolution of the remnant in an ambient medium with a density enhancement from west to east . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the remnant was born in a preexisting cavity and that the bright inner emission is due to the reflection of the initial shock from the dense cavity wall . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario may provide a new candidate mechanism to explain the x - ray morphology of other thermal composite supernova remnants . </S>"
