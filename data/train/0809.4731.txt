    "in this paper we consider the effects of the spontaneous breaking of time - reversal ( @xmath5 ) invariance in electronic systems . this is a problem of considerable current interest particularly in the context of strongly correlated systems . while the physics of strong correlation is important , many aspects of spontaneous time - reversal symmetry breaking are not well understood even at the level of weakly coupled systems , well described by fermi - liquid theory .",
    "the problem that we will consider is that of the possible quantum phase transitions to states in which time - reversal invariance is spontaneously broken in electronic systems with several fermi surfaces , and how to classify them .",
    "one of the most important consequences of the spontaneous breaking of time reversal is that these ground states may exhibit a spontaneous ( nonquantized ) anomalous hall effect .",
    "more specifically , we consider fermi systems with multiple fermi surfaces with condensates in the particle - hole channel that break time - reversal invariance . as a consequence ,",
    "these systems have a nontrivial _ relative _ fermi - surface berry curvature which quantifies the strength of the time - reversal symmetry breaking .",
    "the theory that we present here has a close connection with haldane s analysis of the anomalous hall effect as a berry curvature on the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite the nontrivial new effect that results from these states is that they exhibit a spontaneous anomalous hall effect , _",
    "i.e. _ , present even in the absence of extrinsic effects such as magnetic impurities or external magnetic fields .",
    "time - reversal symmetry breaking in the absence of external magnetic fields or spontaneous spin ordering has been a focus of interest in condensed - matter physics for quite some time , at least since the discovery of high @xmath6 superconductivity in the copper oxide materials .",
    "quite early on it was postulated that frustrated two - dimensional ( 2d ) quantum antiferromagnets may have `` chiral spin liquid '' phases ( or ground states ) , translationally invariant states without magnetic long - range order.@xcite the known behavior of high @xmath6 superconductors does not appear to be consistent with a spin liquid ground state . the discovery of time - reversal symmetry - breaking effects in recent experiments on and in underdoped ( and similar systems ) has renewed the interest in understanding time - reversal symmetry - breaking phases in strongly correlated electronic systems .    the main purpose of this paper is to inquire if it is in principle possible to have an electronic system with a nonmagnetic translationally invariant ground state that breaks spontaneously time - reversal invariance .",
    "such a system would exhibit a spontaneous hall effect and a kerr effect even in the absence of disorder and/or magnetic fields .",
    "we will focus here on simple models of quantum phase transitions in electronic systems , without ferromagnetism or any other form of long - range magnetic order .",
    "we will further assume that these systems have well - defined electronic quasiparticle excitations and are hence extensions of fermi - liquid theory .",
    "this assumption is valid for any mean - field approaches and as will be shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : fluctuations ] , is valid even if the fluctuations of the order parameter around its mean - field value are considered for lattice models .",
    "we will see that , even in this `` weak - coupling '' approach , states with the desired properties are physically sensible .",
    "( naturally , the naive applicability of the details of this theory to a regime of strong correlations , necessary in the context of the cuprates , is questionable . )    within this weak - coupling approach , time - reversal breaking phases can be described in terms of properties of the resulting one - particle states and of their effective fermi surfaces . of particular importance",
    "is the fact that a system with @xmath2 fermi surfaces obtains an `` emergent '' ( and approximate ) local _ gauge _ ( in momentum space ) @xmath7 symmetry near the fermi - liquid fixed point .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : gauge ] we show that the natural way to represent this structure is in terms of an abelian gauge theory of @xmath2 gauge fields .",
    "these gauge fields describe the quasiparticle berry phases @xcite in the sense discussed recently by haldane .",
    "@xcite for systems with one or two band(s ) , the structure of @xmath5 symmetry breaking is described by these gauge fields and the symmetry properties of the quasiparticle dispersion relation under space inversion . however , for more than two bands , more complex @xmath5 symmetry - breaking phases arise involving additional time - reversal breaking operators which are neither berry connections nor the space inversion symmetry of the quasiparticle dispersion relations .",
    "nevertheless , the berry connections and the inversion symmetry of the quasiparticle dispersion relation still describe a large class of the @xmath5 symmetry - breaking states even in multiband models",
    ".    we will only consider the @xmath5 symmetry - breaking phases described by these gauge fields ( berry phases ) and the inversion symmetry of quasiparticle dispersion relations . within this constraint ,",
    "the systems that we describe are invariant under the combined transformation of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the chiral transformation ( _ i.e. _ , a mirror reflection ) and @xmath10 stands for space inversion . with the @xmath8 symmetry",
    ", the @xmath5 symmetry - breaking states can be classified into two classes , according to the accompanying @xmath9 or @xmath10 symmetry breaking .",
    "we refer to the states that preserve all three symmetries @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath5 , as the normal states . as for the @xmath5 symmetry - breaking states ,",
    "if the inversion @xmath10 symmetry is also broken but the chiral @xmath9 and the combined @xmath11 symmetries are preserved , these states will be referred to as type @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , the states that break @xmath5 and @xmath9 but preserve @xmath12 and @xmath10 will be referred as the type @xmath4 states .",
    "the states that break all three of @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath5 are considered as a mixing of types @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "obviously , type @xmath3 states have no kerr or hall effect , but type @xmath4 may have .",
    "the type @xmath3 state is somehow trivial if we notice that the momentum @xmath13 changes sign under @xmath10 or @xmath5 .",
    "hence , in this paper , we mostly concentrate on the type @xmath4 states .    using the berry connections , we show that type @xmath3 phases may appear in one - band or multiband models .",
    "however , the type @xmath4 phases can only be found in multiband models .",
    "the phase transitions from the normal phase to the type @xmath4 phase can be classified into two different scenarios depending on whether the band structure has degeneracy points or not ( degeneracy lines or areas usually require fine tuning and will not be considered ) .    after exploring the general theory ,",

    "sec : order_parameter ] , we study the general symmetry properties of the ( fermion bilinear ) order parameters in the particle - hole channel for systems whose band structure contains no degeneracy point and show that the type @xmath4 @xmath5 symmetry - breaking states requires two order parameters .    in sec .",

    "we discuss the possible patterns of spontaneous breaking of time - reversal invariance , inversion and chiral symmetries , and rotational invariance in interacting metallic systems .",
    "although the models we discuss here use the framework of the landau theory of the fermi liquid , the patterns of symmetry breaking that are found , as well as the resulting phenomenology , are of more general interest . in a landau - type model with four - fermion forward scattering interactions , analogous to the type discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite , time - reversal symmetry - breaking phases can be stabilized and are usually accompanied by rotational symmetry breaking . in a one - band model , the type @xmath3 phases can be reached through a pomeranchuk instability @xcite in _ odd angular momentum channels _ ( with angular momentum @xmath14 ) , nematic - like phases with broken space inversion and time reversal .",
    "however for two - band models type @xmath4 phases may also appear , and have a similar structure to the @xmath15 phases in fermionic systems with spin described in refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] . in this section",
    "we construct the phase diagram . here",
    "we also evaluate the hall conductance for these phases , which is not quantized since these phases are gapless and conducting .",
    "we also show that the hall conductance found here is related with a topological index , the kronecker index of the homotopy mappings @xmath16 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath17 .",
    "this in turn implies that the @xmath5 symmetry breaking in these phases is stable against adiabatic perturbations , even though the actual value of the _ unquantized _ hall conductance is not universal and can be changed continuously .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : lattice_model ] , we generalize these @xmath5 symmetry - breaking phases to lattice models and discuss subtle effects arising from the degeneracy points in the band structures . in particular we show that without degeneracy points , the time reversal @xmath5 and chiral @xmath9 symmetry - breaking phase can be reached from a normal fermi liquid either by a direct first - order transition or by two separate phase transitions through an intermediate phase characterized by rotational symmetry breaking .",
    "but in the presence of degeneracy points , the direct transition between the @xmath5 and @xmath9 symmetry - breaking phase and the normal fermi liquid may be second order .    finally , in sec .",

    "a similar phase diagram was found in interacting monomer - dimer models on a 2d square lattice.@xcite    an alternative possible scenario is that the two ising transitions do not meet at a multicritical point . instead , that the lower temperature ising transition becomes first order at some value of the control parameter , _",
    "i.e. _ , a 2d ising tricritical point .",
    "the general topology of the phase diagram is depicted in fig.[fig : phase - thermal2 ] . here",
    "too the intermediate phase can either be an @xmath124 phase , in which case time reversal is restored at the lower temperature transition and the intermediate phase is nematic , or isotropy is restored first and the intermediate phase breaks time - reversal .    still a third possibility arises if at @xmath201 the @xmath15 and normal phases are separated by a region of the @xmath124 phase . in this case",
    "the @xmath201 transition is continuous , and one would generally expect two thermal transitions , as shown in fig.[fig : phase - thermal3 ] , with an intermediate temperature phase that at least at low temperatures must be an @xmath124 phase . the possibility of another intermediate phase discussed above , isotropic and @xmath5 breaking , can not be excluded even in this scenario .",
    "finally , let us consider briefly the case of @xmath205 lattice symmetry breaking , beyond the @xmath206 symmetry of the square lattice we have been discussing here , _",
    "i.e. _ , simple triangular and honeycomb lattices .",
    "we will now have to consider more general angular momentum channels , with @xmath83 even or odd . specifically , for the simple triangular and honeycomb lattices the simplest cases of interest have @xmath87 and @xmath69 broken by the @xmath205 symmetry .",
    "an example of this is the one - band model on a simple triangular lattice discussed above .",
    "two - band models on these lattices allow for a richer structure .",
    "the simplest case is a @xmath153 state with an @xmath69 particle - hole condensate without relative particle - number conservation of any type .",
    "this state breaks spontaneously the @xmath74 inversion symmetry and the @xmath74 chiral symmetry .",
    "hence , the thermal transitions to the normal state of this phase also have a @xmath204 , as in the square lattice case discussed above , with a phase diagram similar to those in figs.[fig : phase - thermal1]-[fig : phase - thermal3 ] .",
    "( just as in the case of the square lattice , this analysis also applies to the phase @xmath19 with the same caveats on the interpretation of the symmetries . )",
    "a different symmetry - breaking pattern arises on both the simple triangular and honeycomb lattices if the condensate is in the @xmath87 particle - hole channel . in the @xmath153 state with @xmath87",
    ", the @xmath207 symmetry is lowered to @xmath208 ( inversion in 2d ) symmetry , where the @xmath209 axis is lifted .",
    "hence , @xmath210 is the broken rotational symmetry manifold of the order parameter .",
    "in addition to this @xmath211 , this phase also breaks the @xmath74 time - reversal symmetry , which here is equivalent to chiral symmetry .",
    "hence , it breaks a @xmath212 symmetry .",
    "the thermal phase diagram for this @xmath213 problem is more complex ( and old problem ) than the cases we presented above ( see refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "the structure of the phase diagram can be summarized in three cases : a ) a direct transition to the normal state , b ) an intermediate temperature critical phase , and c ) an intermediate phase with long - range order . in the first case ,",
    "the transition between the @xmath153 phase and the normal phase is a direct first - order transition ( similar to that of the closely related six - state potts model ) . in the second case",
    ", there is a finite range of temperatures in which the system is critical , as in the @xmath214 model , and has two kt - type transitions at each end - point .",
    "the third case consists of a sequence of partial restorations of the @xmath211 and @xmath74 broken symmetries of the @xmath153 state through intermediate temperature phases with either @xmath211 nematic order and no broken time - reversal symmetry or with broken time - reversal invariance and full isotropy .",
    "we studied microscopic fermionic models ( generally in metallic phases ) with spontaneous breaking of time - reversal invariance .",
    "we considered one - band models and two - band models ( ignoring spin ) with and without separate conservation of particle number in each band . the time - reversal breaking phases can be classified in two classes :    1 .",
    "type @xmath3 phases , which break time reversal ( @xmath5 ) and space inversion ( @xmath10 ) but do not break chirality ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "we found that type @xmath3 phases occur in both one - band and multiple - band fermionic systems in a generalized nematic ground state with a ( particle - hole ) condensate in an odd angular momentum channel .",
    "examples of type @xmath3 phases we discuss are one - band nematics with @xmath69 and two - band models in the @xmath152 state , which has a particle - hole condensate with @xmath83 odd without independent particle number conservation in each band .",
    "type @xmath4 phases , which break time reversal ( @xmath5 ) and chirality ( @xmath9 ) but do not break space inversion ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "type @xmath4 phases have a spontaneous ( non - quantized ) anomalous hall effect .",
    "we found that type @xmath4 phases are not realized in one - band models . in two ( and multiple ) band models they occur in interband particle - hole condensates with _ even _ angular momentum if particle number is not separately conserved in each band ( @xmath153 phases ) , @xcite and in any angular momentum channel @xmath215 provided particle number is either preserved in each band ( @xmath134 phases ) or conserved modulo @xmath105 ( @xmath19 phases ) .",
    "each class of states has unique experimental signatures that can be detected in linear and nonlinear conductivity measurements , and in the optical response with polarized light .",
    "let us discuss first how these phases can be detected in transport .",
    "it is well known that electronic nematic phases induce an anisotropy in the conductivity tensor.@xcite in a metallic system , an in - plane electric field @xmath179 induces a current @xmath216 which can be expanded as a power series in the electric field @xmath179 , @xmath217 with @xmath218 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220 being @xmath144 or @xmath96 . the first term in eq .",
    "is the linear response , and the second term is the leading nonlinear response .",
    "the different components of the conductivity tensor ( and of the nonlinear response ) can be arranged to transform properly under chiral @xmath9 and space inversion @xmath10 symmetries , and can be used to detect these broken - symmetry phases in experiment .",
    "thus , the conductivity tensor is sensitive to both rotations under @xmath221 and chirality , while the third rank nonlinear conductivity tensor is odd under inversion . to detect systems with condensates with @xmath222 ,",
    "it is necessary to consider higher order nonlinear response terms .",
    "thus , one can construct phenomenological `` order parameters '' using the electrical response tensors , and the simplest ones are presented in table [ table : conductance ] .    the signatures of type @xmath3 @xmath223 breaking phases can be detected through nonlinear optical processes , such as polarized raman scattering .",
    "[ they can also be checked directly by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) by detecting the anisotropy of the fermi surface .",
    "] on the other hand , type @xmath4 phases , such as the @xmath15 phases , can be detected optically through a nonzero kerr effect ( in the absence of external magnetic fields ) .",
    ".conductance tensors for different phases . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the problem of constructing phases of electronic systems with broken time - reversal invariance was presented here mainly from its intrinsic conceptual interest .",
    "our interest in this problem has been to a large extent motivated by the recent discovery of time - reversal symmetry - breaking effects in the ruthenates and in the cuprates .",
    "we should stress that although the theory we presented in this paper as it stand can not describe a strongly correlated system , the patterns of symmetry breaking , as well as their consequences , should be of more general validity .",
    "the strongest experimental evidence available to date of time - reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors is in the layered compound .",
    "kerr effect rotation experiments@xcite and corner junction experiments@xcite strongly suggest that this material may indeed have a @xmath224-wave superconducting state which breaks spontaneously time - reversal symmetry .",
    "this is consistent with a theoretical prediction@xcite of a condensate with a @xmath225 order - parameter symmetry .",
    "this evidence is however not fully uncontroversial given the conflicting experimental results of ref . [ ]",
    "which , so far , have failed to detect the expected edge currents of the @xmath76 superconductor .",
    "recent high - precision kerr rotation experiments@xcite have now given evidence of weak but detectable time - reversal symmetry breaking in the underdoped pseudogap regime of the high @xmath6 compound .",
    "neutron - scattering experiments in underdoped @xcite , and in hgba@xmath226cuo@xmath227 @xcite similarly suggest that the breaking of time - reversal invariance may also occur in these materials .",
    "these recent discoveries in the cuprates and in have renewed interest in the possible mechanisms of time - reversal symmetry breaking in strongly correlated systems .",
    "however , it is worth to note that , in addition to the noted evidence of time - reversal symmetry breaking , neutron - scattering experiments@xcite and transport experiments@xcite find strong evidence for nematic charge order in in the same doping range .",
    "it is unreasonable to believe that these two phases can be unrelated to each other , and perhaps they have a common origin . in this sense",
    ", the phases found in this paper may shed some light on these issues .",
    "one important problem that we have not discussed in this work is the role of disorder in these phases .",
    "it is well known that disorder couples as a _ random field _ to the order parameter of anisotropic nematic - like phases,@xcite destroying the ordered state and rendering the system glassy .",
    "the same applies to other phases we discussed here that break spontaneously either point - group symmetries and/or inversion . on its own",
    ", nonmagnetic disorder can not couple directly to the chiral symmetry and does not destroy automatically a type @xmath4 time - reversal breaking state .",
    "however , if the spin degrees of freedom are also included even nonmagnetic disorder can couple indirectly to time - reversal breaking order parameters through the effects of spin - orbit interactions . in this case",
    "the system becomes a @xmath5-breaking glassy state . on the other hand",
    ", disorder can induce @xmath5 and @xmath9 breaking effects in phases such as type @xmath3 states by breaking locally translation , inversion , and point - group symmetries of the system . in any case",
    ", the time - reversal symmetry - breaking effects induced by disorder should be quite weak.@xcite    other states that break time - reversal symmetry to varying degrees have been postulated in the context of high @xmath6 compounds .",
    "these states assume the existence of spontaneously circulating currents in the ground state .",
    "they include the loop state advocated by varma , @xcite which breaks time reversal but not translation invariance , and the @xmath78-density wave state of charkravarty , laughlin , morr and nayak @xcite , a @xmath78dw state that breaks time reversal and translation invariance ( by one lattice spacing ) but it is invariant under the simultaneous action of both transformations . in the absence of disorder neither of these states exhibits a uniform kerr effect .",
    "et al_@xcite proposed a @xmath78dw state with @xmath189 symmetry that breaks translational symmetry and has nonzero kerr effect .",
    "there is a close analogy between the @xmath15 phase and the @xmath225 ( or @xmath77 ) superconducting state .",
    "they both need two real order parameters that couples the @xmath132 rotational symmetry and an internal @xmath0 symmetry to break the @xmath5 and @xmath9 symmetries .",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry in the @xmath225 spin triplet condensate in the particle - particle channel in superconductors is the charge ( `` gauge '' ) @xmath0 symmetry , which is an exact symmetry of the system and can not be broken explicitly .",
    "on the other hand , the formally analogous @xmath15 phase is a particle - hole condensate which breaks spontaneously the relative @xmath0 phase symmetry of a multiband system .",
    "this symmetry in general is not exact but it is asymptotically exact `` emergent '' symmetry at the fermi - liquid fixed point , since the symmetry - breaking terms are formally irrelevant ( `` dangerous irrelevant '' ) operators which are always present in any real system .",
    "the difference , between exact and `` emergent '' symmetries , has a direct consequence on the structure of the phase diagram , rendering the quantum phase transition from the normal state to the @xmath15 phase first order or through an intermediate @xmath124 phase .",
    "our @xmath15 phases have a close similarity with the phases ( with the same name ! ) in spin-1/2 fermionic systems with anisotropic phases such as those discussed in refs . [ ] and [ ] .",
    "however , the @xmath15 phases of those systems are not type @xmath4 @xmath5 symmetry - breaking states for two reasons .",
    "first under time reversal all three components of the spin polarization of the quasiparticles changes sign .",
    "in contrast , here we have used the pauli matrices to act on an internal space unrelated with the electron spin , a `` pseudospin '' representing the multiple electronic bands . in our case",
    "_ only _ the complex , @xmath228 , component is odd under time reversal .",
    "secondly , the internal symmetry in our problem is only an approximate @xmath0 phase symmetry , while in the spin problem it is the full @xmath109 group ( in the absence of the spin - orbit couplings ) .",
    "we have shown that for systems with @xmath2 degenerate bands , the ( natural ) symmetry is @xmath229 ( @xmath230 for this case ) , and the berry connection @xmath231 , defined in sec . [",
    "sec : gauge ] , is always trivial and it can always be eliminated by a gauge transformation ( it is a gauge transformation ! ) due to eq . .",
    "hence , the actual berry phase [ no matter @xmath0 or @xmath109 ] is zero if the @xmath229 symmetry is exact . as a result , in the fully symmetric case ( as well as in the spin-1/2 model )",
    "there are no type @xmath4 @xmath5 symmetry - breaking states .",
    "this can also be seen if we notice that the map from the fermi surface to the internal @xmath0 group is @xmath16 , which has a nontrivial homotopy group , @xmath17 , with a non - vanishing kronecker index .",
    "in contrast , for the case of spin-1/2 systems , the mapping @xmath233 has a trivial homotopy , @xmath234 , and does not have a nontrivial topological index .",
    "we should emphasize that the electronic quasiparticles of the systems we have considered do carry spin-1/2 , but these degrees of freedom play no role in the phases we have discussed as they are paramagnetic .",
    "we thank steven kivelson and congjun wu for many insightful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation grant dmr 0758462 at the university of illinois ( ef ) and by the department of energy , division of basic energy sciences under award de - fg02 - 07er46453 through the frederick seitz materials research laboratory at uiuc ( ks and ef ) .",
    "by definition , the matrix @xmath36 satisfies @xmath235 this constraint on @xmath36 implies that the off - diagonal terms and the diagonal terms are related .",
    "it follows that @xmath236 which leads to the conclusion that there is no berry phase in the overall ( charge ) @xmath0 sector .    for a two - band model",
    ", we can construct three gauge invariant objects that are sensitive to time - reversal symmetry breaking @xmath237 however , due to eq .",
    ", only one of them is linearly independent .",
    "hence , in the study of the @xmath5 symmetry breaking in any two - band model , only the diagonal term @xmath238 ( or @xmath239 ) is needed to be considered .",
    "the same conclusion is trivially valid for one - band models .",
    "from a topological point of view , in a two - band model , a unitary transformation at momentum @xmath13 belongs to the group @xmath73 . by removing the @xmath89 gauge degrees of freedom ,",
    "the physical degrees of freedom are in the manifold @xmath240 .",
    "hence , for each closed loop @xmath241 in momentum space , a map @xmath242 can be defined .",
    "similar to the coherent - state path integral of spin @xmath243 ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this map leads to a wess - zumino term .",
    "we will show here the berry phase studied in the main text is half of the wess - zumino term of this map ( mod @xmath244 ) .",
    "for a two - band model , the kinetic energy part of the hamiltonian is a @xmath245 hermitian matrix , which can be expanded in the basis of the identity matrix and the three pauli matrices : @xmath246 away from degeneracy points , @xmath247 is nonzero .",
    "hence , we can define a 3d unit vector @xmath248 from a topological point of view , this 3d unit vector field is a map from the momentum space ( with degeneracy points removed ) to @xmath249 .",
    "if we define the polar coordinates of the unit vector @xmath140 as @xmath250 and @xmath251 , where @xmath252 , the hamiltonian can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation , @xmath253 , where @xmath254 here @xmath255 and @xmath256 is any function of the momentum , which reflects the @xmath89 gauge freedom in a two - band model . therefore , we get @xmath257 the loop integral around contour @xmath241 is @xmath258 where @xmath23 is an integer measuring the winding number of the angle @xmath259 . by comparison ,",
    "the wess - zumino term of the map from @xmath241 to @xmath249 is @xmath260 here @xmath261 is an arbitrary 2d manifold whose boundary @xmath262 is @xmath241 and @xmath23 is an integer determined by the choice of @xmath261 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the berry phase @xmath263 is half of the wess - zumino term up to @xmath177 .    under a change in chirality , the wess - zumino term changes sign ( mod @xmath264 ) . therefore , @xmath265 changes into @xmath266 under @xmath9 , which is the same as @xmath11 .",
    "hence , @xmath265 is invariant under @xmath8 .",
    "for the hamiltonian shown in eq . , the hall conductance @xmath139 can be evaluated as in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the three - component unit vectors @xmath267 defined in eq .",
    ", @xmath268 here the integration region @xmath261 is the area in momentum space where one band is filled and the other is empty .    for insulators , the region @xmath261 is the whole momentum space ( the first brillouin zone for lattice models ) , which is a compact manifold .",
    "hence , @xmath139 is the kronecker index of the mapping from a compact manifold to @xmath249 , the first chern number , which is quantized to be an integer .",
    "it measures how many times the compact manifold wraps around the sphere @xmath249 .",
    "for conductors , the boundary of @xmath261 is the fermi surface , which implies that @xmath261 is not a compact manifold .",
    "hence , for conductors in general @xmath139 is not quantized.@xcite    using the conclusion from appendix [ app : wilson_loop ] , the hall conductance @xmath139 can be related to the loop integral @xmath263 as @xmath269 where the contour @xmath241 is the boundary of @xmath261 , which is the fermi surface , and we choose the gauge where @xmath238 is analytic in region @xmath261 to remove the @xmath177 uncertainty in @xmath263 .",
    "this result is straightforward if we notice that @xmath263 contains all the information of @xmath5 and @xmath9 symmetry breaking in two - band models .",
    "therefore , @xmath139 , which measures the type @xmath4 @xmath5 symmetry breaking at low energies , must be directly related with @xmath263 , where @xmath241 is the fermi surface , which dominates the low - energy physics .",
    "for a @xmath78-wave - like ( @xmath87 ) @xmath18 phase on a square lattice , the symmetry breaking is reduced from @xmath270 to @xmath271 . in the normal phase , in addition to the point - group symmetry of the square lattice @xmath206",

    "hence , the resulting symmetry of the ordered phase is @xmath274 .",
    "therefore , the thermal phase transition from the @xmath18 state to the normal state is in the 2d ising universality class .",
