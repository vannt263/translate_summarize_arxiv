    "thanks to their uncommon spectroscopic properties , rare - earth ion - doped crystals ( reic ) have been proposed for a large variety of signal processing applications , stretching from classical signal processing to quantum memories .",
    "most classical signal processing architectures using reic are based on the creation of a grating imprinted in their absorption profile  @xcite .",
    "this grating can be either spectral or spectro - spatial .",
    "angle of arrival estimation  @xcite and time reversal  @xcite are based on spectral gratings .",
    "analog - to - digital conversion  @xcite , detection of correlations  @xcite , lidar range doppler imaging  @xcite , true - time delay  @xcite or spectral analysis  @xcite use spectro - spatial gratings .",
    "many of these architectures have been demonstrated in tm : yag , a reic that provides multi - ghz bandwidth , sub - khz resolution limit , and accessibility to diode lasers altogether .",
    "however , the diffraction efficiencies did not exceed @xmath2% in the experimental demonstrations .",
    "the atomic frequency comb ( afc )  @xcite , one of the many quantum memory protocols developed specifically for reic , is also based on a spectral grating ( or spectro - spatial grating in the case of the spectro - spatial atomic comb ( s2ac )  @xcite ) .",
    "surprisingly enough , diffraction efficiencies up to @xmath3%  @xcite in tm : yag and @xmath4% in pr : yso  @xcite have been observed with afc .",
    "reaching such efficiencies requires the use of long - lived ground state sublevels for storage instead of the metastable level used in the classical processing experiments . yet",
    "the presence of closeby sublevels within the inhomogeneous line leads to grating replicas at other frequencies , limiting the grating bandwidth to the smallest ground or excited state splitting ( typically a few mhz in tm : yag or pr : yso ) .",
    "nevertheless , a spectral or spectro - spatial grating in a reic with closeby ground state sublevels can exist over a broad bandwidth , by transferring atoms between the ground state sublevels from bright fringes to dark fringes .",
    "the grating period must be adjusted so that the grating replicas add constructively with the original one .",
    "this way , the total grating bandwidth can considerably exceed the ground state splitting .",
    "the absorbing and transparent fringes are intrinsically and unavoidably linked together since they mutually feed each other . in order to emphasize this inseparability",
    ", we propose to name the scheme `` interlaced spin grating '' ( isg ) .",

    "in these two demonstrations however , the diffraction efficiency did not exceed @xmath8% .",
    "in the applications we have in mind , the active material behaves as a programmed filter .",
    "this filter has to process weak signals and to offer a large dynamic range .",
    "in addition the signals may reach the filter at random times and we aim at @xmath9 interception efficiency , which requires continuous operation capability .",
    "only a passive filter may satisfy those conditions .",
    "filtering through an inverted medium  @xcite may offer large diffraction efficiency but is not consistent with the above requirements .",
    "medium inversion entails spontaneous emission and even amplified spontaneous emission . besides",
    ", continuously refreshed inversion would require high intensity continuous illumination , which is source of heating and is not compatible with operation at cryogenic temperature .",
    "finally , massive excitation of the active medium gives rise to complex relaxation processes , such as energy migration , that deeply alter the programmed function  @xcite .    in this paper",
