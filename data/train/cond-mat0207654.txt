    "in spite of the fact that a decade has passed since the first definitive observation of charge transfer along the dna base - pair stack @xcite , the detailed properties of this process have not been definitively elucidated .",
    "this is partly due to the inherent complexity of the molecular structure of dna , and to the large number of external and intrinsic factors that exert an influence on dna structure and behavior .",
    "the current unsettled situation also reflects the absence of an overall agreement on the precise mechanism by which this charge transport takes place .",
    "one of the key issues that awaits full illumination is the role of disorder  both static and dynamic  on the propagation of charge along the base - pair stack .",
    "a related , and quite fundamental , question is whether charge transport is a coherent quantum mechanical process , like conduction of electronic charge against a static , or deformable , background , or whether it it takes place as fundamentally incoherent transport , as a variation of the random walk .",
    "the answers to these and other questions will have a significant impact on both our understanding of the biological impact of charge transport in dna and the development of applications based on this phenomenon .    despite the often contradictory results of experimental investigations @xcite , a few conclusions seem inescapable .",
    "the first is that long - range charge transport along the base - pair stack depends quite strongly on the sequence of the base pairs @xcite .",
    "in addition , base - pair mismatches can have a significant deleterious effect on charge transport @xcite ( see , however @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , strands of dna display considerable disorder , both static @xcite and dynamic @xcite .",
    "finally , several sets of experiments on ensembles of short dna strands have uncovered an unusual two - step charge transfer process @xcite .",
    "these studies focus on fluorescent charge donors intercalated in dna oligostrands .",
    "as the charge migrates towards the acceptor , the fluorescence is quenched and the rate of migration is determined by the decaying fluorescence profile .",
    "the data reveals that this decay process occurs according to two characteristic time - scales which are separated by more than an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "any model that purports to explain charge transport must take all this into account .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss a model for short range charge transport along a base pair stack that undergoes substantial structural fluctuations .",
    "the process occurs via thermally - assisted quantum mechanical tunneling of charge carriers from one base pair to the next , under the assumption that this tunneling is properly characterized as occurring in the presence of a dissipative environment .",
    "a key conjecture is that charge transfer takes place only when the neighboring pairs are in a state of optimal `` alignment '' , and that this alignment is statistically unlikely in thermodynamic equilibrium . as we will see , this conjecture leads in a natural way to a model exhibiting the dual - time - scale feature described above .",
    "additionally , the model generates predictions that can be readily tested .",
    "we shall relate the problem at hand to the dynamics of a simple two level system ( tls ) , realized by a donor and an acceptor state .    in section  [ sec : tunneling ]",
    ", we briefly recapitulate what is known about the tunneling process in the presence of friction for a tls system .",
    "we also quantify our notion of a coordinate @xmath0 associated with the `` alignment '' of adjacent base pairs and of the influence of the dynamics of this new coordinate on charge transfer .",
    "section [ sec : model ] specifies the model for describing a generic collection of two - level systems ( tls ) , initially in the donor state and characterized by a fluctuating alignment variable @xmath0 . the probability distribution of donor states , @xmath1 obeys a kramers equation with a sink term due to charge transfer to the acceptor .",
    "the rate of charge transfer will be expressed by the fluctuating rate @xmath2 .",
    "this kramers expression is recast into the form of a volterra equation with the use of a lie - algebra approach defined on the hilbert space of the eigenstates of the kramers equation for @xmath3 .",
    "we will discuss limiting cases of the solution to obtain physical insight and to reveal the two - time - scale decay of the probability distribution due to the sink term .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] with a discussion of the possible application of our results to charge transfer in strands of dna consisting of several base pairs .",
    "the key result of our calculations lies in the determination of @xmath4 , the probability distribution of donor states evaluated at the optimal configuration @xmath5 and with the @xmath6 variable integrated out .",
    "indeed , under the assumption that the tunneling process is most effective at @xmath7 , this quantity is directly related to the fluorescence intensity @xmath8 of the base pair complexes , as probed by j. barton and a. zewail @xcite , through the following :    @xmath9.\\ ] ]    the quantity @xmath10 of the above relationship is a proportionality constant and @xmath11 is the integrated rate of transfer to the acceptor .",
    "we shall determine the double exponential character of @xmath4 , and hence of @xmath8 , in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings .",
    "the conjectures made on the existence of an optimal and unlikely configuration @xmath5 will be crucial in obtaining the two stage decay process , a result that justifies the assumptions made .",
    "the model we shall construct is obviously not restricted in application to dna oligostrands .",
    "using our results , we may conclude that in an ensemble of generic systems the migration of a particle from donor to acceptor proceeds statistically as a two - time scale process , provided the transfering process is of rare occurrence .",
    "the process of charge transfer from a donor site to an acceptor site a two - level system  is ubiquitous in biochemical and physical phenomena @xcite .",
    "it occurs under a broad variety of spatio - temporal conditions .",
    "chemical bond formation or destruction , atp production in photosynthetic reactions , or the operation of semiconducting devices , all involve the transfering of charges to and from specific sites , via thermal activation or quantum - mechanical tunneling through an energy barrier . because of its intrinsic nature , charge transfer via quantum - mechanical tunneling takes place on a length scale of up to tens of angstroms @xcite ; larger distances are possible if other transport mechanisms are involved .",
    "these include thermal hopping among sites , which are typical in disordered systems , the creation of conduction bands in metals , or of lattice distortions of polaronic type in specific systems .",
    "quantum - mechanical tunneling from a donor site to an acceptor site is quite simply represented by a two - level system ( tls ) @xcite . in this description ,",
    "the tunneling particle is limited to being in the donor or in the acceptor state , while the other degrees of freedom of the system , nuclear for instance , describe the charge potential energy .    the energetic profile of the system is thus characterized by a multidimensional surface of which the acceptor and the donor states constitute relative minima , separated by a barrier .",
    "of the many existing degrees of freedom , it is often possible to identify a `` reaction coordinate '' @xmath12 such that the energy barrier between donor and acceptor is minimized along this specific direction .",
    "the progress of the reaction is then dominated by the evolution along this coordinate and the potential energy surface can be reduced to an effective one - dimensional curve .    in certain systems the physical interpretation of the reaction coordinate is immediate : it may be the relative bond length in two diatomic molecules , or solvent polarization around the donors and acceptors @xcite .",
    "it is not an easy task to give a physical interpretation of the reaction coordinate in the case of dna base pairs because of the many possibilities involved - intra - base distance , mobile counter - ion concentration , solvent concentration , or a combination of all the above .",
    "a possibility is offered by ref .",
    "@xcite where it is suggested that the most relevant quantity is the interaction of the charge with the polar water molecules of the solvent . in this paper we shall refer to the reaction coordinate @xmath12 in most general terms .",
    "a common representation of tunneling with dissipation is through the spin - boson formalism @xcite .",
    "the donor and acceptor states are represented by means of a pseudo spin , which points up when the charge is in the donor state and down otherwise .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is given by :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the charge in the donor ( up ) state corresponds to the potential @xmath16 whose equilibrium reaction coordinate is @xmath17 , and the converse state corresponds to @xmath18 , whose stable minimum is at @xmath19 .",
    "the @xmath20 term represents contributions to the hamiltonian of a dissipative environment coupled to the reaction coordinate .",
    "figure [ fig : flucdis ] illustrates the meaning of the potential @xmath21 in the effective hamiltonian of eq.([spinboson ] ) .",
    "the curve marked a corresponds to the potential term in the donor state , while the curve marked b represents the potential function in the acceptor state .",
    "this model has been thoroughly analyzed in the work by garg _ _ e__t al .",
    "@xcite based on earlier work by leggett @xcite . a similar analysis , but within a more chemical framework , is presented by marcus _ _ e__t al .",
    "energy conservation requires that charge transfer takes place only when the reaction coordinate is close to the degeneracy point @xmath22 for which @xmath23 ; once the degeneracy point is reached , charge transfer is possible only because of the non zero off - diagonal tunneling matrix elements @xmath24 .",
    "the tunneling rate @xmath11 from donor to acceptor , is calculated in the above references . for moderate dissipation of the reaction",
    "coordinate , it is given by :    @xmath25    where the reorganization energy @xmath26 and the energy barriers @xmath27 and @xmath28 depend on the details of the potential described by the reaction coordinate .",
    "in the limit of high temperatures @xmath29 reduces to the usual temperature @xmath30 , whereas in the opposite limit the quantity is temperature independent .",
    "the novelty explored in this paper is the introduction and investigation of the effect of a second reaction coordinate , @xmath0 , governing the charge transfer process and coupled not to the energy , but to the off - diagonal tunneling element @xmath24 , hitherto been treated as a constant , and which we now write @xmath31 .",
    "this new coordinate reflects the conjecture that in the case of dna the tunneling matrix element is highly sensitive to the donor - acceptor relative configuration . charge transport along dna in fact occurs along the stacked base pairs by means of overlapping @xmath32 orbitals , and at room temperature , these base pairs strongly fluctuate with respect to each other through variations of the twist , tilt and roll parameters @xcite .",
    "the existence of base pair fluctuations for dna in solution is very well established , and is corroborated by experimental @xcite and molecular dynamics studies @xcite .",
    "for such a highly asymmetric system such as dna , fluctuations in the relative orientation of donors and acceptors affect the magnitude of the orbital overlap between pairs , and the new collective coordinate @xmath0 embodies the effects of these fluctuations .",
    "we will also assume that the @xmath0 variable is slowly varying compared to the motion of the reaction coordinate @xmath12 , so as to define the lowest energy scale of the system .",
    "we may then separate the motion of the two reaction coordinates in a born - oppenheimer spirit .",
    "charge transfer will be assumed to be instantaneous once the optimal @xmath33 value is reached , and a purely classical framework will be utilized for the @xmath0-dynamics .",
    "the new reaction coordinate @xmath0 need not necessarily be pictured as a geometrical one , although this is the framework we will be utilizing in this paper .",
    "just as in the case of the @xmath12 reaction coordinate , @xmath0 may be associated to the particular chemical environment of the molecule or to any other quantity influencing the strength of the tunneling element @xmath24 between the donor and the acceptor sites .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the system thus , is a modified version of the spin - boson hamiltonian introduced in eq .",
    "( [ spinboson ] ) with a @xmath34 off - diagonal term , as also described in earlier work @xcite .",
    "in order for charge transfer to take place , we will assume that the reaction coordinate coupled to the energy must be close to the degeneracy point @xmath22 , and , also , that the @xmath0 coordinate must be in the neighborhood of an optimal value @xmath5 , which maximizes the tunneling amplitude .",
    "the physical picture to associate to this requirement is that the relative `` alignment '' , @xmath0 , does not favor charge transfer unless an optimal configuration is reached : @xmath35 unless @xmath36 .",
    "this conjecture will prove to be crucial in yielding the two time - scale charge transfer of references @xcite .    in analogy to the experimental work cited above , we consider a collection of such two - level systems , with the charge initially located on the donor site .",
    "each one of these systems is associated to a particular @xmath31 and through eq .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) to a particular @xmath37 rate .",
    "our objective is to determine the mechanisms of charge transfer taking into account the @xmath0 time evolution and the @xmath2 rates accordingly distributed .",
    "we shall assume the @xmath0 dynamics to be governed by small , langevin type random fluctuations . at @xmath38 ,",
    "when the external charge is injected on the donor site , the distribution of @xmath0 values is the usual boltzmann distribution .",
    "if the occurrence of the optimal @xmath5 configuration is relatively unlikely , we will indeed be able to show that the transfer process is characterized by a two time scale migration of the initial donor population .",
    "the emergence of two time scales in the transfer process can be physically explained as follows .",
    "the existence of an initial non - zero population of tls presenting the optimal value @xmath5 , ensures that rapid tunneling to the acceptor .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution is thus depleted of population at the special value and other transitions are forbidden to take place .",
    "the other tls will tunnel to the acceptor only after the system has re - equilibrated and re - populated the optimal configuration , a process which is slow , because of the assumption that the optimal configuration is a relatively unlikely one .",
    "hence , the existence of a fast , initial decay followed by a slower decay process .",
    "consider a collection of tls which at the initial time @xmath38 are all in the up - donor configuration , and characterized by the angular parameter @xmath0 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath39 the tls population remaining in the up - donor state at time @xmath40 and for which the collective angular variable and its velocity are specified .",
    "the physical requirement that @xmath0 be randomly , classically , fluctuating in time , translates into the fact that @xmath41 must evolve according to a fokker - planck type equation as dictated by standard langevin theory . to this probability evolution equation",
    "we must add an additional depleting term , that which represents tunneling to the donor site as given by the @xmath2 term discussed above .",
    "different scenarios are possible for the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath24 and hence of @xmath11 . as discussed in the above section we shall focus on the particular situation in which tunneling is possible only for a very specific subset of energetically unfavorable @xmath0 values . in this picture ,",
    "tunneling is allowed only if donors and acceptors reach an optimal  but unlikely  orientation one with respect to the other . by including the tunneling term in the time evolution equation for @xmath1 we obtain a modified fokker - planck equation that may be used to approach any physical system in which the presence of a depleting term competes with the usual langevin fluctuations .",
    "the most natural choice for the @xmath0 motion , the one we shall discuss in the remainder of this paper , is that of a damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "we shall see that starting from an initially equilibrated system in which the @xmath0 distribution is the the boltzmann one , the insertion of the tunneling term will result in the emergence of the two time scales discussed above",

    "the goal of the next subsections will be to determine @xmath45 , and in particular its integration with respect to the @xmath42 variable . as described in the introduction in fact , it is this quantity that is directly related to the experiments we wish to model by means of eq.([fluorescence ] ) .",

    "not only has the existence of fluctuations been experimentally documented @xcite , but it has also been suggested @xcite that the motion that most affects the electronic coupling between base pairs - what we have referred to as @xmath31 - is their sliding one with respect to the other . it must be pointed out that both these studies focus on dna in solution , not on dry strands of dna .",
    "on the other hand , charge transport with more than one rate has been reported in the literature @xcite . for an oligomer with the ethedium molecule acting as the donor ,",
    "charge transfer is found to occur along the same patterns as described by our model , with two time scales of 5 and 75 picoseconds .",
    "two - time - scale decays are also observed in a series of measurements @xcite performed on shorter strands of donor and acceptor complexes ( ap - g ) . in these experiments",
    "the ap donor can be treated , for all practical purposes , as an intrinsic purine base , and the ambiguity related to the choice of an extraneous donor ( the ethedium of the previous reference ) is removed .    in both these experiments ,",
    "an increase in the length results in a competition between the fast and slow exponential decays in favor of the slower time component . increasing the length of the system diminishes the possibility that multiple base pairs simultaneously arrange in the configuration that facilitates rapid charge transfer .",
    "when the process of optimal alignment does occur ( a relatively likely event only for a few base pairs ) , the tunneling might not even require localization of the charge on each base pair , and super - exchange can take place .    for long strands of dna ,",
    "thus , we expect the two intrinisic rates associated to a single charge transfer to be averaged out in favor of the slower component .",
    "traces of this unusual two time scale migration mechanism however , may be found in the fact that dna conductivity is enhanced upon increasing the temperature @xcite , presumably allowing for greater base pair motion .",
    "charge transfer is also hindered by disruptions to the stacking , which alter the base pair s ability to find optimal transfer configurations , such as the insertion of bulges along the helix or of strong mismatches within the base pair stacking @xcite which are poorly compatible with the intrinsic conformation of the aromatic pairs .",
    "lastly , it is noted that charge transfer effectiveness seems to be inversely proportional to the measured hypochromicity @xcite , a quantity that determines the ordering of base pairs along a certain direction and defined as the reduction of absorption intensity due to interactions between neighboring electric dipoles . from this data",
    "it is apparent that the higher the disorder of the system , the more efficient charge transfer is",
    ". it would be interesting to see how different solvent environments affect conduction along the molecule in relation to their effect on structural fluctuations .",
    "more temperature - dependent experimental measures are desirable as well .",
    "we have presented a model for a spin boson tls whose tunneling matrix element depends on the structural conformation of the donor with respect to the acceptor . in the limit that the relative geometry between the two fluctuates in time defining the lowest energy scale , we are led to a classical problem , that of a collection of damped harmonic oscillators obeying a modified fokker - planck equation .",
    "if charge transfer proceeds only for specific orientations of the donor with respect to the acceptors , the resulting rate for charge transfer is divided into a fast component at short times and a subsequent slower one .",
    "these results agree with the experimental findings of two - time - scale charge transfer in the donor intercalated dna complexes of j.barton and coworkers @xcite .",
    "it must be noted that an implicit assumption of this work is that for long range dna conduction mediated by thermal fluctuations once the charge has undergone a transfer between base pairs it does not return to the pair at which it is originally localized .",
    "however , it is reasonable to assume that the transfer process will continue after this event has occurred and that subsequent events will , with some probability , deposit the charge at its point of origin at a later time .",
    "we have performed calculations on a two - time - scale hopping model based on the results obtained here @xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "the single set of two base pairs is replaced by a linear array .",
    "we have determined the probability that the charge carrier is at its point of origin as a function of time , @xmath40 , after its having been placed there .",
    "we find that this probability exhibits two - time - scale behavior , with an initial , brief , rapid , exponential decay followed by a much slower , power - law , decay at later times times .",
    "the long - time asymptotics of this process are those of a random walk .",
    "we acknowledge many useful conversations with prof .",
    "r. bruinsma and prof .",
    "we shall adopt a lie - algebra approach @xcite to identify a complete set of orthonormal functions that solve the homogeneous problem in the general case of eq .",
