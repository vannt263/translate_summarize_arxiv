    "although the standard model ( sm )  @xcite of particle physics is extremely successful in describing elementary particles and their interactions ( except gravity ) , one of the key particles predicted and required by the sm to explain the origin of mass , the so called higgs boson , still remains elusive .",
    "the importance of the higgs boson in the sm is not limited to the gauge invariant generation of particle masses . for processes like @xmath8 ,",
    "the coupling of the higgs boson to fermions and @xmath3 bosons is necessary to maintain s - matrix unitarity .",
    "unitarity of the s - matrix reflects the requirement of probability conservation and requires that partial wave amplitudes behave like @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) at high energies , @xmath11 , for renormalizable theories  @xcite .",
    "logarithmically growing terms are also allowed since they may be canceled by higher order corrections  @xcite and , thus , do not spoil renormalizability .    in 1974",
    ", joglekar  @xcite showed that s - matrix unitarity forces the couplings of the electroweak gauge bosons and the higgs boson to take the form of sm couplings at asymptotically high energies .",
    "this implies that , for non - zero lepton masses , higgs boson exchange has to contribute to the process @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , and that the coupling of the higgs boson to leptons and @xmath3 bosons has to be of sm form in order for s - matrix unitarity to be maintained .    in this paper",
    "we investigate through analytical calculations and numerical simulations at what center of mass energy , @xmath6 , the higgs boson exchange diagram in @xmath12 becomes important .",
    "in particular we investigate how experimental acceptance cuts on the @xmath3 decay products affect @xmath6 . with linear @xmath14 colliders in the @xmath15  tev energy range on the drawing board  @xcite , and active development of a muon collider with center of mass energies in the multi - tev range ongoing  @xcite , the question whether one may be able to detect higgs boson exchange effects in @xmath16 is of interest .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec2 ] we discuss in some detail the analytical calculation , and give a brief overview of how our numerical simulations were performed .",
    "results of the numerical simulations are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec3 ] .",
    "we concentrate on @xmath17 collisions , but also comment on the @xmath14 case , and , for completeness , on the academic case of @xmath18 collisions collisions are of academic interest only , since the @xmath19 lepton is too short lived for efficient acceleration and collimation into a beam . ] . we summarize our results in sec .  [",
    "sec : sec4 ] .",
    "to determine the center of mass energy for which the higgs exchange diagram becomes important for maintaining s - matrix unitarity in @xmath20 , we calculate the cross section with and without higgs boson exchange . including the higgs boson exchange diagram lowers the total cross section for @xmath3 pair production in lepton collisions . to quantify for which center of mass energy",
    "the higgs exchange diagram becomes relevant , we impose simple requirements which are discussed in more detail below .",
    "if @xmath3 decays are not taken into account , the calculation is simple enough to be carried out analytically .",
    "the analytical calculation is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec2a ] .",
    "however , for a more realistic estimate , @xmath3 decays should be taken into account .",
    "if both @xmath3 s decay leptonically , the final state contains two neutrinos which both escape undetected .",
    "this complicates event reconstruction .",
    "the small branching ratio of @xmath21 constitutes an additional disadvantage of the all - leptonic final state . if both @xmath3 s decay hadronically , the qcd @xmath22  jet process represents a potentially worrisome background .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the @xmath23 final state which has a large branching ratio , manageable background , and can be fully reconstructed . to calculate the cross section for @xmath24",
    ", we use the parton level event generator madevent  @xcite .",
    "details of our madevent calculation are given in sec .",
    "[ sec : sec2b ] .",
    ".@xmath25-functions used in the calculation of the helicity amplitudes given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude ] )  @xcite . [ cols=\"^\",options=\"header \" , ]     qualitatively similar results are obtained for @xmath14 and @xmath18 collisions .",
    "the results obtained for the @xmath26 cross section with cuts imposed deserve special attention . fig .",
    "[ fig : eewwwithcuts ] shows that the total cross section for the process calculated without the higgs exchange diagram begins to increase for @xmath27  tev , which explicitly indicates that s - matrix unitarity is violated .",
    "we now briefly comment on the uncertainties in the simulated data and in the cross section obtained by madevent for @xmath28 .",
    "large cancellations between the diagrams result in large uncertainties for both @xmath29 and @xmath30 . at @xmath31",
    "tev the standard deviation for @xmath32  ab is @xmath33  ab which corresponds to about @xmath34 of the total cross section . for the same center of mass energy ,",
    "the standard deviation for @xmath35  ab is @xmath36  ab corresponding to @xmath37 of the total cross section . in both cases ,",
    "the uncertainties in the cross section are large , due to cancellations between the individually divergent amplitudes @xmath38 and @xmath39 . the uncertainties for electron and @xmath19-lepton collisions are similar .",
    "finally , we briefly comment on how higher order radiative corrections may affect our results .",
    "the full nlo electroweak corrections to @xmath40 including lepton mass effects ( and the higgs exchange diagram ) have not been calculated yet .",
    "the complexity of the nlo electroweak corrections does not allow us to make educated guesses about the possible effect of these corrections on @xmath6 .",
    "however , at high energies , higher order electroweak corrections are known to grow as @xmath41  @xcite , and eventually have to be resummed .",
    "this may considerably change the numerical results presented here .",
    "the energy for which higgs exchange becomes relevant may well increase or decrease by a factor of  2 or more once these effects are taken into account .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the high energy limit of the processes @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) in order to determine the center of mass energy , @xmath6 , for which the higgs exchange diagram becomes relevant . in the sm",
    ", the higgs exchange diagram is needed in order to guarantee that s - matrix unitarity is maintained in the high energy limit .",
    "two , slightly different , criteria were used to estimate @xmath6 , both leading to similar results .    from a simplified analytical calculation we found that @xmath6 is of order @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the mass of the incoming lepton . as a result ,",
    "the center of mass energies for which higgs boson exchange becomes important for @xmath14 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 collisions are in the region of @xmath46  tev ) , which is far above the energy range of any @xmath17 or @xmath14 collider currently on the drawing board .",
    "we also investigated how experimental acceptance cuts influence the center of mass energy for which higgs boson exchange becomes important .",
    "the @xmath47- and @xmath48-channel fermion exchange diagrams result in a strong peaking of the @xmath12 cross section at small scattering angles , which , due to the @xmath49 nature of the @xmath3-fermion coupling , is inherited by the @xmath3 decay products .",
    "the higgs exchange diagram , on the other hand , leads to a distribution which peaks at large scattering angles . imposing angular cuts on the final state particles",
    "thus tends to lower the center of mass energy for which the higgs exchange diagram becomes important .",
    "the effect of the angular cuts increases with growing energies , and is most pronounced for @xmath14 collisions where the angular cuts chosen in this paper decrease @xmath6 by almost a factor  7 . for comparison , for @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) collisions , angular cuts decrease @xmath6 by about a factor  3 ( 2.5 ) . for",
    "more ( less ) stringent angular cuts , the effect on @xmath6 increases ( decreases ) .",
    "our results were obtained from simple tree level calculations and one does have to worry about how higher order electroweak corrections may affect them .",
    "unfortunately , the nlo electroweak corrections to @xmath50  fermions have been computed in the limit of massless incoming leptons only  @xcite .",
    "however , electroweak radiative corrections are known to increase logarithmically with the center of mass energy  @xcite , and , eventually , have to be resummed .",
    "they may thus substantially change @xmath6 , although the general order of magnitude estimate presented in this paper should remain correct .",
