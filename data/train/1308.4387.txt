    "related to the deficiency in properly describing the core density , we note that unitary evolution of the implies that @xmath84 this means that , not only is the total particle number conserved ( which is physical ) , but the integrated `` gap '' is also conserved @xmath85 . in fermionic systems , pair - breaking excitations will reduce the gap , resulting in a mixture of superfluid and normal fluid ; in highly excited systems the superfluid may vanish completely .",
    "the on the other hand does not admit this behaviour , and even highly excited systems will still have a rapidly fluctuating but non - zero order parameter .",

    "if this correction turns out to be significant , then one might have to introduce gradient corrections in a more complicated form ( compared to the simple weizscker term ) that does not spoil vortex structure and collision dynamics .",
    "such corrections will be non - universal ( i.e. must have a different form for small densities than for large densities ) and probably most conveniently accounted for in two - fluid model with an additional `` normal '' component that can populate the vortex core . the approximation to the discussed in  @xcite may shed some light on the nature of these types of corrections .",

    "once a system contains appreciable power above the pair - breaking threshold , detailed dynamics of topological defects disagree markedly between the two theories  vortex lattice crystallize in the , for example , but remain chaotic in the .",

    "in fig .  [ fig : e_vs_t ] we compare how the total energy of the system changes through four sample stirring simulations .",
    "both and simulations with @xmath216 that result in a single vortex display the same qualitative behaviour : first the energy increases as the stirring potential is turned on and fluid is displaced ( slight quantitative differences on the 10% level appear here due to the aforementioned differences in the displaced densities ) .",
    "the stirring potential nucleates a vortex from the edge of the trap , and then effectively pins the vortex : the stirring potential displaces fluid , thereby creating an attraction for the vortex which also prefers a density depletion in its core .",
    "the vortex then oscillates in this pinning potential , causing an oscillating force on the stirring potential that appears as oscillations in the energy @xmath217 as the stirring potential does work on the system .",
    "since usually only one vortex is attached to the pinning site at any given time , the @xmath218 can be associated with the pinning force exerted by the pinning potential on the vortex . since the velocity of the stirrer , @xmath219 , is almost identical in the two simulations , this points to the fact that @xmath218 ( per unit length ) is larger in the compared to .",
    "this is not surprising because the force exerted on the superfluid by a potential @xmath220 can be written as , @xmath221 and the depletion in the density in the core of the vortex which is the source of the pinning force , is smaller in the compared to the .",
    "finally , the stirring potential is removed , leaving the single vortex , which an orbit determined by a counter - circulating image vortex outside the trap  @xcite .",
    "the subsequent motion of the vortex is almost identical in both and simulations since it results from long - distance superfluid hydrodynamic boundary effects rather than buoyant force ( the trap is flat at the orbital radius ) which would be more sensitive to the difference in vortex mass due to non - zero occupation of the core in the .    for @xmath222 , a similar picture",
    "is presented : vortices are nucleated from the boundary of the system , and one remains pinned to the stirrer while three others perform complex orbits as governed by the magnus relation in the presence of each other , the boundary of the trap , and the stirrer .",
    "the motions of the vortices appears to be chaotic  small changes in initial conditions , lattice resolution , etc .",
    "lead to different trajectories .",
    "for example , in the high - resolution @xmath128 simulation with @xmath223 , eventually four vortices remain in the bulk , whereas with the @xmath127 simulation and the @xmath224 simulations , one vortex attaches itself to the boundary of the trap and vanishes once the stirrer is removed , as in the corresponding simulation . at several times during the simulation ,",
    "the stirring potential catches up with one of the free vortices and the vortex - pinning interaction exerts a stronger force on the stirrer , allowing it to perform work on this system : this appears as jumps in the energy evolution .    for @xmath225 ,",
    "the and the simulations have both qualitative and quantitative differences .",
    "the stirrer in the leaves five vortices in the bulk of the trap , while the @xmath127 simulation ends with only two vortices .",
    "increasing the resolution to @xmath128 gives six final vortices , though for a slightly smaller stirring speed ( @xmath226 ) five vortices are left , matching . in the , however , the stirrer creates filamentary structures that are not seen in the . for higher @xmath139 ,",
    "the qualitative differences between the two models become even more pronounced : in particular , as discussed before , the low - resolution simulations become so noisy that it is difficult to identify the vortices . with higher resolution",
    ", however , the retains the somewhat striking property of the fermionic simulation , that coherent superfluidity persists for super - sonic stirring @xmath227 . as pointed out in  @xcite , this is due to the compressible nature of the superfluid : the stirring potential compresses the superfluid , raising the local critical velocity .",
    "of course , strictly speaking , the always remains superfluid , but for sufficiently fast stirring , the phase fluctuations are so rapid that a coarse - grained picture will find little spatial coherence .",
    "an improved two - fluid model would include such a coarse - graining procedure to convert superfluid to the normal fluid .",
    "the excitation energy ( the difference between the energy after the removal of the potential and before the introduction of the potential ) as a function of the number of vortices created in the bulk ( @xmath228 ) . ]    from the total energy difference after the stirrer is removed we can calculate the total excitation energy .",
    "this depends primarily on the number vortices added to the system , though there are minor contributions due to excited phonons .",
    "the classical estimate  @xcite @xmath229 where @xmath230 is the angular momentum which is roughly proportional to the number of vortices , and @xmath231 is the moment of inertia of the superfluid in the trap , suggests that it increases quadratically with the number of vortices .",

    "<S> direct simulation of many macroscopic phenomena lies outside the realm of current technology , so in this paper , we validate to what extent a computationally simple model called the model can characterize the dynamics of the strongly interacting , finding that it performs well for low - frequency dynamics , and identifying its limitations . </S>",
    "<S> this validation played a crucial role in solving the mystery of the `` heavy solitons '' observed in  @xcite where the was used to demonstrate the consistency of the observations with vortex rings instead of solitons  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the computational problem is that most fermionic superfluid ( of the kohn - sham variety such as the mean - field equations or equations ) require evolving hundreds of thousands of single - particle wavefunctions , occupying vast amounts of memory . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the  @xcite provides an attractive computational method for studying bosonic superfluids where the superfluid is represented by a single wavefunction for the condensed state . </S>",
    "<S> the model considered here has the same computational simplicity , and thus can be applied to macroscopic systems . </S>",
    "<S> we find that it performs well for low - frequency dynamics , suggesting that it might provide the basis for a practical method of simulating macroscopic volumes of fermionic superfluids required to understand phenomena like neutron star glitches .    </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the model fails when significant energy is present near the pair - breaking scale . in fermionic , </S>",
    "<S> energy above the pair breaking threshold converts superfluid to normal fluid , hence we suggest that the conservation of @xmath1 might be a good measure of the applicability of the and validate this diagnostic . </S>",
    "<S> we also suggest how the model might be improved to better model more energetic scenarios .    the is a universal model for dilute fermi gasses comprising two species of the same mass interacting with a zero - range resonant attractive interaction of infinite @xmath2-wave scattering length . </S>",
    "<S> it provides an ideal problem to benchmark many - body techniques for several reasons : it has a simple and universal but remains highly non - perturbative with strong interactions , is directly realized in cold - atom experiments  @xcite , and provides a good approximation for the dilute neutron matter  @xcite in the crusts of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> this universal system is stable , and the absence of a length scale for the interaction implies that the energy - density @xmath3 is characterized by the single universal dimensionless coefficient @xmath4 known as the bertsch parameter  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> significant effort has been put into determining the bertsch parameter @xmath4 over the past decade , and only recently has it been computed  @xcite and measured  @xcite to high precision ( see  @xcite for a survey ) . </S>",
    "<S> the current best fit value @xmath9 is obtained by consistently fitting both and experimental results  @xcite with a self - consistent fermionic called the .    </S>",

    "<S> many different dynamical processes have been described in  @xcite , including vortex nucleation through stirring , vortex - vortex interactions , vortex ring formation etc . </S>",
    "<S> these simulations , however , required super - computing resources for even modest physical volumes . </S>",
    "<S> the largest system studied in  @xcite contained @xmath10 particles represented by wavefunctions on a @xmath11 lattice . to compare , typical cold - atom experiments comprise some @xmath12 particles  @xcite , which would severely tax current computational resources , even if symmetries are utilized . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , while the dynamics of a single vortex in neutron matter may be within reach of cutting edge computing  @xcite , simulating multiple vortices separated by several lattice lengths will require significantly more resources . </S>",
    "<S> thus , validating and generalizing computationally more efficient methods like the model is critical for scaling calculations up to macroscopic systems .    </S>",
    "<S> the  @xcite is essentially a bosonic theory describing dimers / cooper - pairs in the with a single collective condensate wavefunction that has been used to analyze the expansion and breathing mode frequencies of cold atomic gases in a trap  @xcite , their surface oscillations  @xcite , collisions of clouds of fermions  @xcite , vortex generation  @xcite , vortex pinning  @xcite , instabilities  @xcite , and soliton dynamics  @xcite . while the has the same symmetries , and can be tuned to have the same as the full theory , one expects poor behaviour when excitations approach the pair - breaking threshold set by the gap @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the only low energy degree of freedom  the superfluid phonon  exists in both theories , and matching the ensures that speed of sound is the same . </S>",
    "<S> this ensures that the linear response for small frequencies and momenta match , but we find good agreement for small frequencies even at finite momenta @xmath14 , suggesting that the could be a good description of   dynamics for slowly varying probes . </S>",
