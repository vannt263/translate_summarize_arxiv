    "( at 3.6 to 160 @xmath0 m ) , found high number counts compared to non - evolving galaxy number counts models .",
    "this implied that strong evolution of the source populations must have occurred , challenging contemporary galaxy evolution models @xcite .",
    "deeper number counts test galaxy formation models more severley . by stacking _ spitzer _",
    "mips 24  @xmath0 m  sources , at least 80% of the cfirb was resolved at 70  @xmath0 m  and 65% at 160  @xmath0 m  @xcite .",
    "a small fraction ( 10 - 20% ) has been resolved in the submillimeter in blind sky surveys from ground - based observatories , but it is possible to go deeper by taking advantage of gravitational lensing . at 850  @xmath0 m",
    "this approach has resolved 60% or more of the background in small fields @xcite .    a @xmath2   probability of deflection  analysis of bolocam observations of the lockman hole @xcite demonstrated that a fluctuation analysis can provide more stringent constraints on source number counts than those derived by extracting individual sources , for which the threshold must be set high enough to ensure a minority of false detections .",
    "@xmath2  techniques were first developed for application to radio observations @xcite , but have since been widely applied to other regimes .",
    "@xmath2  was used to account for the majority of the x - ray background long prior to the availability of sufficiently deep imaging to resolve individual sources @xcite , to extend deep infrared counts @xcite , and in the sub - mm to scuba @xcite , laboca @xcite , and aztec @xcite data .",
    "the depth of a @xmath2  analysis is set by the flux density at which the number of sources per beam becomes large .",
    "the resulting contribution to the @xmath2  becomes that of a poissonian distribution with a large mean , which becomes difficult to distinguish from the nearly - gaussian instrumental noise .",
    "an often - used rule of thumb for the maximum depth is one source per beam , but the precise limit depends on the survey area , the shape of the underlying counts , and how precisely the instrumental noise is known . in practice , for rapidly rising source counts at faint fluxes , this is considerably deeper than the limits for a source - extraction approach .",
    "fluctuation analyses are well - suited to determination of source number counts in the case where the dynamic range of detected sources is not large because of confusion .",
    "deep number counts are interesting because they allow us to measure the sources responsible for the bulk of the cfirb , and because they probe intrinsically fainter galaxies which may have better matching counterparts in the local universe .",
    "recently , a @xmath2  analysis was performed on 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath0 m  observations of a 10 @xmath3 field ( goods - s ) with a 0.8 @xmath3 deep inner region from the balloon - borne blast telescope , using duplicate spire detector technology ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p09 ) .",
    "differential number counts were estimated down to 20 , 15 , and 10 mjy in the three bands , respectively .",
    "below these thresholds , upper limits were provided .",
    "combined with 24  @xmath0 m  observations , @xcite concluded that a large fraction ( @xmath4 ) of the cfirb comes from galaxies with @xmath5 . also from blast observations ,",
    "@xcite concluded that 24  @xmath0m - selected galaxies can account for the entire cfirb based on a stacking analysis .",
    "these results confirm that fluctuation and stacking analyses have substantial power in elucidating the sources of the cfirb .",
    "such techniques will also be necessary for spire observations because galaxy models predict that at the confusion limit spire is expected to resolve only a small fraction of the cfirb @xcite .",
    "a recent source extraction - based analysis of the spire science demonstration phase ( sdp ) data  the same data used in this paper  directly resolved @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 per cent of the cfirb at 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath0 m , respectively @xcite . at shorter wavelengths ,",
    "@xcite directly resolved 52 and 45 per cent of the cfirb at 100 and 160 @xmath0 m  using _",
    "herschel_-pacs sdp data .",
    "the observations used in this analysis were obtained with the spire instrument @xcite on the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite as part of the hermes programme ( oliver et al .",
    "2010 , in prep ) during the sdp .",
    "spire observes simultaneously in three passbands : 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath0 m .",
    "the on - orbit beam sizes , including the effects of the scanning strategy , are 18.1 , 25.2 , and 36.6 arcseconds , respectively , with mean ellipticities of 7 - 12% .",
    "the calibration is based on observations of neptune , and is described in @xcite .",
    "observations of five fields were obtained during sdp , but only three are used in this analysis : goods - n , lockman - north , and lockman - swire .",
    "their properties are summarized in table  [ tbl : data ] .",
    "the lockman - north region are contained within the shallower lockman - swire field .",
    "the hermes sdp fields omitted from this analysis are : fls , which was left out because it is the same depth as the much - larger lockman - swire field and is significantly contaminated by infrared cirrus , and abell 2218 , because the strong lensing in this field complicates the interpretation of the background number counts .    the detector ( bolometer ) timelines were processed using the standard spire pipeline , which detects cosmic rays and removes instrumental signatures and temperature drifts @xcite .",
    "the maps were produced using the smap package ( levenson et al .",
    "2010 , in prep ) using @xmath9 beam - fwhm pixels ( 6 , 8 1/3 , and 12 arcsec ) ; this is a compromise between adequately sampling the beam and maintaining even coverage over the map .",
    "samples flagged as contaminated by cosmic - rays were excluded .",
    "each map was masked to form an even - coverage region and was mean subtracted .",
    "in addition to the even - coverage mask , a small amount of additional masking was required , as there are five resolved sources in the lockman - swire field .",
    "these sources are relatively bright , but are not the brightest in the field . since the @xmath2  formalism is based on unresolved point sources , we mask these objects with a 2 arcmin circular mask , and then correct our final number counts using the measured flux of each excluded source .",
    "our instrumental noise estimates are based on the technique of @xcite , and are assumed to have 5% uncertainty , which represents only the uncertainty for a fixed calibration .",
    "the overall spire calibration error is discussed in   [ subsec : systematics ] .",
    "the resulting pixel flux density histograms are shown in figure  [ fig : histos ] .     , width=340 ]    smoothing the maps by the beam ( via cross - correlation ) is beneficial for finding isolated point sources . for blast observations ,",
    "@xcite show that the standard point - source - optimized filter should be modified in the presence of confusion noise .",
    "however , there is no guarantee this will benefit a @xmath2  analysis .",
    "smoothing the map has the effect of broadening the effective beam , which decreases the depth that the @xmath2  can probe , while also reducing ( but correlating ) the instrumental noise .",
    "we empirically determined if smoothing is beneficial for our analysis by fitting simulated data with and without smoothing and comparing the scatter in the recovered model parameters to the error estimates , and found that it helps for all but our deepest map ( goods - n ) ; note that our goods - n data are several times deeper ( relative to the confusion noise ) than the deepest blast observations .",
    "it is likely that some amount of spatial de - convolution would be beneficial for the goods - n field , but since this would significantly complicate the instrumental noise properties of our maps , and hence require extensive testing , we do not pursue de - convolution here , but do beam - smooth the two shallower fields .",
    "in addition , we have applied a 6 arcmin high - pass spatial filter to our maps to reduce the effects of clustering on our results . the motivation for this",
    "is discussed in   [ subsec : filtering ] .",
    "a @xmath2  analysis is critically dependent on measurements of the effective beam ( which includes the effects of the map making and reduction , as well as any smoothing applied ) .",
    "our beam map is based on in - flight fine - scan ( highly oversampled ) observations of neptune with a large number of repeats and small offsets between each scan .",
    "these observations allowed us to measure the beam with finer resolution than our data maps to properly match the spire calibration ( which is timestream rather than map based ) , and to build beam maps for the individual bolometers .",
    "we corrected these observations for the relative motion of neptune during the scans using the horizons ephemeris computation service at the orbit of _ herschel_. the neptune observations are deep enough that the third airy ring is clearly detected for the array - averaged beams .",
    "as discussed later (   [ subsec : systematics ] ) , beam uncertainties are our largest identified systematic .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     marginalized fit parameters for a spline interpolation model from a joint analysis of all three fields including the firas cfirb prior of @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainties are the same as in table  [ tbl : splinenoprior ] .",
    "[ tbl : splineprior ]                 flux density is proportional to the total flux contribution in each band .",
    "[ fig : cfirb_contrib],width=340 ]      our basic tool for estimating the importance of a particular systematic is to compute the @xmath10 between the @xmath2  with and without the effect for maps the same size and depth as our data .",
    "we use the p09 best fit model as a basis for this computation . recall that a @xmath10 of 0.5 corresponds roughly to a @xmath11 statistical error .",
    "because different parts of the map are sampled by different bolometers , and the beam shape varies across the bolometer array , the effective beam will vary over the map .",
    "we evaluated this effect by choosing 200 random pixels in our maps and computing the fractional contribution of each bolometer to each pixel .",
    "we then built per - bolometer maps from our neptune observations , and combined these to find the effective beam at each of these locations .",
    "the beam varies across the map in a complicated fashion because even in our deepest map each pixel only samples a limited subset of bolometers .",
    "this produces significant variation in the @xmath2  with position . in general , the @xmath2  computed for the bolometer - averaged beam does not have to be the same as the @xmath2  computed for each bolometer and then averaged across the array ( which is the @xmath2  of the entire map ) . to evaluate the importance of this variation",
    ", we compare the @xmath2  for the average beam to the @xmath2  computed for all 200 pixels and then averaged .",
    "the @xmath10 of this comparison is @xmath12 , so for our analysis this is negligible .",
    "although we masked each map to exclude the low - coverage edges , the hermes sdp observations were not dithered between repeats so there are significant variations in the number of measurements per pixel even within the high - coverage regions ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "this will introduce slight non - gaussian tails to the instrument noise distribution .",
    "we simulated this effect in two ways .",
    "first , we generated random realizations of the instrument noise , including the uneven coverage , and compared the @xmath2  using the resulting noise to the @xmath2  assuming the noise is purely described by the average @xmath14 , and found negligible @xmath10 .",
    "second , our end - to - end simulations ( also including @xmath15 noise ) implicitly include uneven coverage effects , and we found no bias in the recovered parameters .",
    "future hermes observations will include dithering , which will also have the benefit of improving the homogeneity of the beam .",
    "@xcite explore the noise characteristics of the sdp maps by carrying out ` jack - knife ' tests on the data .",
    "their findings are generally consistent with the expected noise properties , but it is difficult to rule out some additional level of non - gaussian noise beyond the @xmath15 behavior we have simulated . directly computing the effects of the jack - knife noise histograms on our model",
    "shows that any additional non - gaussianity has negligible effects for the sdp data , down to our lowest constrained knot ( 2 mjy ) .",
    "this may not be true for future observations where the larger field sizes will reduce the statistical error considerably .    to test the sensitivity to the beam model",
    ", we use an alternative set of neptune observations with a much smaller number of repeats and coarser sampling .",
    "furthermore , the pointing of these observations is not corrected for the small offset between the _ herschel _ and spire clocks , and hence they suffer from pointing drift relative to the maps of the science fields .",
    "the pipeline nominally corrects for this offset .",
    "however , to be conservative , we allow for the possiblity that the pointing drift might not affect the beam maps in the same way as the science maps : we repeat the fits using the alternative beam , and use the difference in the results as an estimate of the beam systematic .",
    "this is the dominant identified systematic effect , with @xmath16 .",
    "we take the differences between the recovered parameters between the two beams as the systematic error on each knot as given in tables  [ tbl : brokpownoprior ] and [ tbl : splinenoprior ] . as our understanding of",
    "the spire beams improves , it should be possible to decrease this error .    to further explore issues of pointing drift",
    ", we have constructed a simple drift model for the goods - n field using jack - knife comparisons .",
    "we then generate simulated maps with and without applying this model .",
    "because the effect of the model is largely to twist successive observations relative to each other , this has very little effect on the @xmath2 , amounting to @xmath17 relative to the statistical errors .",
    "while our results should represent the number counts in our fields quite well , sample variance means that they may not perfectly represent the number counts we would obtain with an infinitely large field . if we make the strong assumptions that the spire clustering properties measured in @xcite apply equally at all flux densities ( and , in particular , to depths 10 times greater than they were measured ) , that the redshift distribution of our sources is independent of measured brightness , and that the source population peaks at @xmath18 , then a simple analytic computation suggests that sample variance could be a 20 per cent effect on the total number counts in goods - n .",
    "more empirically , if we split the lockman - swire field into sub - regions there is evidence for variation in the pixel histogram from sub - field to sub - field .",
    "however , after applying our high - pass filter the variations are no longer statistically signficant ; that is , the difference between sub - fields lies in the mean rather than the shape of the histograms .",
    "alternatively , mean subtracting each sub - field produces the same effect .",
    "this suggests that the fact that our measurements are not sensitive to the mean map values ( and therefore are mean - subtracted ) may provide some protection against sample variance effects . since estimating the size of this effect is highly model dependent , we have not attempted to include this in our error budget",
    "we do , however , fit the three fields independently at 250  @xmath0 m  and compare the results , although the different depths complicate this somewhat . for simplicity , we do not marginalize over the instrument noise in this fit , since the only purpose is to compare the three fields .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : fieldcompare ] . within the uncertainties ,",
    "the fits are consistent .",
    "the post - sdp hermes observations will allow sample variance effects to be better quantified .",
    "m  differential number counts derived from the three fields for the multiply - broken power - law model .",
    "only statistical errors are shown and the firas prior is not included .",
    "[ fig : fieldcompare ] , width=340 ]    we do not include the effects of the spire calibration uncertainty ( @xmath19 across all bands ) in our error budget , except when using the cfirb prior or computing the fraction of the firas measurement accounted for by our model .",
    "however , any updates to the spire calibration are easily incorporated into our results without refitting : if the flux scale is multiplied by a factor @xmath20 the knot positions @xmath21 and the knot values decrease by @xmath22 .",
    "in general , our results agree well with those of p09 , except for the faintest fluxes fully constrained by their analysis .",
    "for example , at 250  @xmath0 m  they find @xmath23 at 20 mjy , while our result is @xmath24 .",
    "however , as discussed earlier , they did not marginalize over the instrumental noise for their deepest field , so their errors may be somewhat underestimated here .",
    "there is also some evidence from simulated data that the small number of knots and knot placement right at the break in the number counts may have biased this knot in the p09 analysis .",
    "we find good agreement with the stacking analysis of the blast data , but see some mild disagreement at higher fluxes for direct counts of the same data @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig : brokpow ] .",
    "the deepest number counts available at these wavelengths are the result of a semi - traditional source extraction method on the same hermes data set @xcite .",
    "these are compared in figure  [ fig : brokpowoliver ] .",
    "where there is overlap , the agreement is good . a similar analysis was carried out using h - atlas sdp data by @xcite ; this is also shown .",
    "unlike the hermes source extraction and @xmath2  analysis , the h - atlas counts are 250  @xmath0m - selected at all wavelengths , and hence may not entirely probe the same point source population . nonetheless , again the agreement with the hermes results is good .",
    "a few features are worth noting .",
    "first , we clearly detect a break in the number counts around at 20 mjy in all bands at high significance .",
    "however , the spire data alone do not detect the change in slope in @xmath25 necessary to keep the cfirb finite , as the differential counts continue to rise to the lowest limit of our analysis more steeply than @xmath26 .",
    "when the firas prior is added , a break is present , but this mostly affects the lowest flux knot , for which we can only provide an upper limit ( the effects on the other knots are mostly due to the strong correlations between knots ; the firas prior changes the structure of the correlations significantly at low flux densities ) .",
    "second , there is possible weak ( @xmath27 ) evidence for a ` bump ' in the differential counts around 400 mjy at 250  @xmath0 m .",
    "there is no evidence at 350 and 500  @xmath0 m  around this flux density , but the error bars are large . however , this bump is present in the independent h - atlas field @xcite at 250  @xmath0 m .",
    "the cause is unclear ; lensing is an intriguing possibility , but we would expect the signature of lensing to be larger at 500 @xmath0 m  due to stronger negative @xmath28-correction effects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we can compare our model fits to the confusion noise estimates of @xcite measured using a different technique .",
    "the often - used criterion of one source per every @xmath29 beams is difficult to use , since its translation into the effects on observations depends strongly on the underlying model @xcite .",
    "hence , we adopt the square root of the variance of the source contribution to the pixel distribution ( @xmath30 ) as our measure .",
    "we find values of @xmath31 mjy in the three bands , slightly higher than the @xcite values , but by less than @xmath32 .",
    "our fits are compared with a selection of literature models in figure  [ fig : modelcomp ] .",
    "no currently available model entirely fits our counts , especially when all three bands are considered .",
    "there is a general discrepancy in the galaxy number count models in that the theoretical models generically overpredict the number of bright galaxies ( in the several @xmath33 10 to several @xmath33 100 mjy range , limited at the upper end by uncertainties in the @xmath2  number counts ) compared to the number counts from the @xmath2  analysis .",
    "the best match overall across all three spire bands is given by the model of valiante et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .",
    "we interpret the discrepancy in the context of the theoretical models of @xcite and @xcite ( figure  [ fig : modelcomp ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : galaxylum ] the redshifts and fir luminosities of galaxies are plotted versus their observed flux densities for the @xcite simulations .",
    "the transitions from luminous to ultra - luminous infra - red galaxies ( lirgs to ulirgs , at @xmath34 ) with increasing observed flux densities occurs at approximately 12 , 6 , and 3 mjy , in the 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath0 m  spire bands , respectively .",
    "thus , the discrepancy at the bright end likely results from the presence of too many ulirgs in the theoretical models .",
    "it should be noted that the intrinsic luminosities of the underlying galaxy population that contribute to any given bin in observed flux density depend on the redshift distributions and spectral energy distributions ; however , the very brightest galaxies are likely either intrisically extremely luminous ( ulirgs or brighter ) , low redshift , or strongly lensed .",
    "there is a large dispersion in redshifts represented by galaxies in each observed flux density bin , with means in the range @xmath35 , with the average flux densities only mildly inversely correlated with redshifts ( due to the negative @xmath28-correction ) .    in all three bands at and below 2",
    "mjy , the @xmath2-derived number counts are consistent with the theoretical galaxy number count models .",
    "this is not surprising because : ( i ) the theoretical galaxy number count models are constrained not to overpredict the cfirb , which arises , in large part , from numerous faint galaxies ; and ( ii ) the upper limits of the lowest flux density knot in each band lies well above the theoretical number counts models .",
    "another more subtle feature also seems apparent in the measured counts .",
    "the results from both fitting methods  lending some confidence to their credence  have depressions at the third - lowest flux density knots with respect to the theoretical number count models at low - to - moderate significance ( depending on the theoretical model ) , which are exclusively concave down in this range ( a few mjy to a few times 10 mjy ) .",
    "the stacking analysis of @xcite is not deep enough at 250 or 350  @xmath0 m  to verify this feature , although the turnover in @xmath36 from the peak at approximately 10 mjy downward is clear at 250 @xmath0 m . at 500  @xmath0 m",
    ", the stacking analysis does not display the depression .",
    "this flux density range is approximately at the confusion limit ( where the flux density is equal to the confusion noise , @xmath37 mjy ) and multiple galaxies contribute to the flux density in each beam .",
    "thus , referring to the @xcite models ( figure  [ fig : galaxylum ] ) , this flux density range corresponds to the transition from ulirgs to lirgs , suggesting that lirg number counts may also be overrepresented by the theoretical galaxy number counts models .",

    "we have measured the differential galaxy number counts from _ herschel_-spire science demonstration phase hermes observations at 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath0 m  using @xmath2  techniques and two simple parametric models .",
    "the number counts were measured down to 2 mjy , approximately a factor of 3 below the 1 @xmath14 confusion noise .",
    "we find that @xmath38 per cent of the measured cfirb is accounted for by point sources at 250 @xmath0 m  , falling to @xmath39 per cent at 500 @xmath0 m .",
    "the errors on the fraction of the cfirb accounted for by these sources are now dominated by those of the firas measurement . however , because of the remaining fraction not accounted for by our fits , this is still not a competitive method for measuring the total cfirb .",

    "we find somewhat better agreement at fainter fluxes , at or below the break , but the agreement is still not perfect .    our main systematic uncertanties arise from our understanding of the spire beams .",

    "<S> we analyze three fields from the hermes programme in all three spire bands ( 250 , 350 , and 500 @xmath0 m ) ; parameterized galaxy number count models are derived to a depth of @xmath1 mjy / beam , approximately 4 times the depth of previous analyses at these wavelengths , using a @xmath2  ( probability of deflection ) approach for comparison to theoretical number count models . </S>",
    "<S> our fits account for 64 , 60 , and 43 per cent of the far - infrared background in the three bands . </S>",
    "<S> the number counts are consistent with those based on individually detected spire sources , but generally inconsistent with most galaxy number counts models , which generically overpredict the number of bright galaxies and are not as steep as the @xmath2-derived number counts . </S>",
    "<S> clear evidence is found for a break in the slope of the differential number counts at low flux densities . </S>",
    "<S> systematic effects in the @xmath2  analysis are explored . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effects of clustering have a small impact on the data , and the largest identified systematic error arises from uncertainties in the spire beam .    </S>",
