    "many astrophysical observations demand very high - resolution imaging and a stable psf over the desired field  of  view .",
    "the former is limited by the size of the pupil and presence of central obstruction , while the latter is limited only by the obstruction .",
    "theoretically unobstructed pupils deliver a simpler psf compared to obstructed designs .",
    "we know from the studies of @xcite that the accurate knowledge of the psf is significant to make precise science measurements on astronomical images .",
    "recent works done by @xcite and @xcite suggest that unobstructed pupil have a faster survey rate for wide - field survey missions to study dark energy .",
    "these wide - survey images are used to perform strong lensing and weak lensing analyses .",
    "we know that lensing analyses depends on the precision with which we can measure the ellipticity and position  angle of a large number background sources and hence the shear and convergence produced by the lensing mass .",
    "the objective of this paper is to quantify the image quality of an obstructed and unobstructed telescope for such a wide - field survey mission . in this paper",
    "we focus on space based telescopes because ground based telescopes even with ` multi conjugate adaptive optics ' ( mcao ) are still not suitable to perform high resolution surveys .",
    "optical designs based on three aspheric mirrors ( dubbed three  mirror ",
    "anastigmat or tma ) are favored in modern astronomical instrumentation because these telescopes have a wider field  of  view for a given pupil size . and",
    "it is possible to build a range of diffraction - limited designs using this configuration .",
    "tma telescopes were proposed by @xcite and developed by @xcite and @xcite . traditionally , these telescopes consist of a secondary mirror which partially obstructs the light falling on the primary mirror .",
    "this type of three mirror telescope are called obstructed tma ( hereafter otma ) .",
    "a few telescopes have been built recently in which the secondary mirror is offset from the path of the incoming light and no obstruction is present in front of the primary reflector .",
    "these type of telescopes are called unobstructed tma ( hereafter utma ) .",
    "the design of utma telescopes was discussed by @xcite and @xcite . for stellar astrometry ,",
    "utma design delivers better precision , for example gaia @xcite .",
    "also unobstructed telescopes can image exoplanets close to bright stars with high contrast @xcite .",
    "hence , utma designs have been proposed for exoplanet characterization missions like echo @xcite and spices @xcite . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize the theoretical advantage of using an unobstructed pupil .",
    "the effective light gathering area of an obstructed pupil is lesser than an unobstructed pupil .",
    "and the blur size on the image plane increases with increasing obstruction .",
    "the focal image of a point source at infinity or psf of a focusing optical system is the fourier transform of its pupil shape . in the case of a circular pupil ,",
    "the shape of the psf is the airy pattern with a bright central disc and faint concentric rings .",
    "we know from the studies of @xcite that in the airy pattern of an annular aperture there is significant transfer of energy from the central disc to the outer rings .",
    "the presence of support structure will also produce additional artefacts on the psf .",
    "@xcite show in their work that the survey rate for a mission is directly proportional to the light gathering area and inversely proportional to the blur size for a given snr .",
    "therefore unobstructed telescopes must have faster survey speed for a given snr .",
    "they also demonstrate that for unobstructed telescopes there is an increased density of resolved galaxies for weak lensing analyses .",
    "@xcite show that the diffraction pattern of an otma telescope can destroy or mimic the lensing signals we desire to study because of the larger blur size .",
    "hence the tighter psf of utma telescopes should be beneficial for wide - field lensing missions . in this work",
    "we will quantify the precision with which utma telescopes can perform science measurements for weak lensing analyses compared to otma telescopes having same characteristics .",
    "the objective of this work is to quantify the precision with which utma and otma telescopes can perform morphological parameter measurements for a wide field survey . in order to reach this goal",
    "the work was organized as follows .",
    "first , we modeled and optimized in parallel an otma and an utma telescope , both having the same primary mirror , effective focal length and fov .",
    "the science requirements for our study are same as that of the _ euclid _ mission @xcite .",
    "second , we created an end - to - end semi - realistic samples of elliptical galaxies passed through the full instrumental path , psf convolution , ccd pixelisation , and noise effects .",
    "third we selected and controlled the biases of the fitting routine for measuring galaxy morphologies .",
    "then we measured the ellipticity in the simulated galaxies and calculated the error introduced by the psf on the error budget .",
    "finally , we compare the precision with which both the designs can perform the desired measurements .",
    "the paper structure sequentially follows these steps .",
    "to compare the image quality of the two designs we need astronomical images observed using both the designs . to simulate quasi - realistic images we need atleast the psf of the designs over the desired field  of  view ( fov ) .",
    "the end goal of this section is to compute the psf for optimized designs of both the telescopes .    in this section",
    ", we present an overview of the method we used to design and optimize the otma and utma telescopes .",
    "first , we recall the parameters and conventions which are used to describe a telescope .",
    "next , the procedure to derive first - order telescope design parameters is detailed . finally , using the telescope design parameters we design and optimize the telescopes in a commercially available optical design program zemax .",
    "we use the same program to compute the spot diagram , ee plots and psf at the desired locations over the desired field  of  view ( fov ) .    from first principles",
    ", we recall that due to aberrations and diffraction there is never a one  to  one correspondence between a source and its image on the focal plane .",
    "geometrical optics , which treats light as a collection of rays traveling in straight lines is a good starting point to reduce the blur size of the focal image in the desired fov .",
    "a design is successful when the optical aberrations it produces are small compared to the absolute physical limits set by diffraction .",
    "this abberation limited system will be further optimized using zemax , which takes into account the diffraction effects .      by definition , three ",
    " anastigmat ( tma ) telescopes consists of three conic reflecting surfaces ( see figure [ tmaparam ] ) .",
    "the characteristics of a tma can be defined using two families of parameters .",
    "the fundamental design parameters , which define the optical configuration from an image perspective and the constructional parameters , which define the optical configuration from an engineering perspective .",
    "the fundamental design parameters constrain the pixel scale , resolution limit , fov , etc .",
    "the fundamental design parameters as defined in @xcite are given below .",
    "@xmath1 : :    focal length of the three mirror system , always positive @xmath2 : :    height or radius of the primary mirror ( pm ) @xmath3 : :    focal ratio of the pm @xmath4 : :    focal length of the two mirror system , set to be positive for    cassegrain type , and negative for gregorian type b : :    location of the two mirror focus with respect to the vertex of the pm ,    positive if beyond the vertex of the pm , negative if inside .",
    "@xmath5 : :    location of the tertiary mirror ( tm ) with respect to the two mirror    focus , positive if beyond the focus , negative if inside .",
    "@xmath6 : :    slope of the paraxial chief ray entering the system    the constructional parameters allow us to construct the telescope or to model them in an optical design program .",
    "constructional parameters of tmas constitute the surface curvatures @xmath7 , conic constants @xmath8 and the separation between the surfaces @xmath9 .",
    "a few of these parameters are shown in figure [ tmaparam ] .",
    "in addition to these constructional parameters utma telescopes have three decenter distances called @xmath10 that correspond to offset of the centre of the reflecting surfaces from the axis perpendicular to the focal plane .",
    "the mission requirements fix the fundamental design parameters of the telescope .",
    "we use the _ euclid _ mission requirements @xcite to fix the following parameters \\{@xmath11 m , @xmath12 m , fov@xmath13 deg@xmath14}. for _ euclid _ the proposed wavelength range for the visual band instruments is 550900 nm . since it is not possible to introduce a spectrum in the optical design tool , we chose 3 discrete wavelengths to represent this band , they are \\{550 nm , 725 nm , 900 nm}. the diffraction effects were calculated for these wavelengths .",
    "the fixed values of \\{@xmath2,@xmath1,fov } will be used as starting point for both the otma and utma designs . for wavelength 550 nm and @xmath12 m",
    "we obtan an image scale of 8.47 arc - sec / mm . for @xmath11",
    "m , we compute an airy disk radius of 13.69 @xmath15 ( or 0.12 ) for @xmath16 550 nm and 22.41 @xmath15 ( or 0.19 ) for @xmath16 900 nm .",
    "the image scale and airy radius dictate theoretical ability to detect psf anisotropies close to the resolution limit .",
    "if the pixel size is larger than the airy disk size , the psf effects will not be noticeable .",
    "therefore for our image quality analysis in section 3 we simulate images with pixel scale 0.025and 0.1 .",
    "the former pixel scale is much smaller than the airy radius and the latter is in the order of the airy radius . for pixel scales larger than this",
    "the otma and utma will have similar image quality .",
    "also sources with artifacts smaller than the resolution limit are unresolved for both the designs .",
    "the constructional parameters required to model an otma telescope can be obtained from the fundamental parameters using the relations derived in @xcite ( cf appendix a for details ) . to calculate the constructional parameters we need all seven fundamental parameters .",
    "three of the fundamental design parameters are constrained by the design requirement , so we have freedom to select the remaining parameters according to our practical constraints . in this work",
    ", we constrained the physical size of the designs and imposed a flat focal plane to obtain the remaining fundamental parameters ( cf appendix a for details ) .",
    "we generated a large family of otma telescope designs all obeying our constraints , from which one design was arbitrarily chosen to serve as a typical otma telescope .",
    "this telescope is named otma1 . the fundamental design parameters and the constructional parameters for the chosen otma telescope",
    "are shown in table [ tmafundotma ] and table [ tmaconstoparam ] respectively .",
    "the central obstruction for the chosen design is 248 mm .",
    "therefore , the linear obscuration for the design is 20.6% .",
    "the design of utma telescopes were discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the work by @xcite illustrates two examples of utma , but no analytical or numerical methods are provided to obtain those designs .",
    "the work by @xcite gives a rigorous numerical technique to determine the shape of the mirror surfaces .",
    "though , this method is very general it has the caveat of not being straightforward to implement with modern ray - tracing software ( because this method uses non - conic surfaces ) and is optimized only for the central fov .",
    "in contrast , we propose here a simple method to design an utma telescope from an otma telescope .",
    "the basic idea of the procedure is illustrated in figure [ uotmastep ] .",
    "we select an unobstructed sub - pupil from the primary mirror ( pm ) of a given otma telescope .",
    "this unobstructed portion can be used as a stand - alone utma telescope .",
    "but the resulting telescope will have a smaller pm compared to the original otma telescope . to obtain an utma telescope with the desired aperture ,",
    "we scale the otma telescope before separating a sub - pupil .",
    "we use the paraxial ray - trace equations and the condition that no rays incident on the primary surface should be obstructed by the secondary surface and tertiary surface ( no vignetting ) to obtain the ` scale - factor ' .",
    "this ensures us that the utma pupil is uniformly illuminated .    to obtain the scale factor ,",
    "let @xmath17 be the paraxial ray height , separation from the next surface , angle of incidence and angle after reflection .",
    "we already defined @xmath2 to be the height of the pm , let the height of the scaled mirror be @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the scale - factor .",
    "similarly , we denote the height of the secondary mirror ( sm ) and the scaled sm by @xmath20 and @xmath21 . using the ray trace equations in @xcite we obtain the scale - factor as follows .",
    "we find that scaling does not change constructional parameters , but it does change fundamental design parameters . keeping the pm focal length ( @xmath23 ) invariant requires us to adjust the pm focal ratio . in other words , scaling @xmath2 by a factor _ s _ decreases @xmath3 by the same factor . following our mission constraints , we applied this procedure on the otma1 design to obtain the scaled  otma1 design whose",
    "fundamental design parameters are shown in table [ tmafundotma ] .",
    "the scale - factor calculated using equation ( 9 ) , is approximately 2.5 .",
    "the constructional parameters of the scaled design are unchanged .",
    "unfortunately , this family of designs have an intrinsically narrow diffraction - limited fov . here",
    "we derive a fov of 0.3@xmath240.2 deg@xmath14 ( computed using zemax ) .",
    "the main reason for this narrow fov is the decrease in @xmath3 associated with the scaled design .",
    "the utma1 design is not suitable for our science requirement because of its narrow fov , but science requirements less demanding in field size may find in this design an attractive and compact solution .",
    "a convenient way of increasing the utma fov , is to start with an otma having a large @xmath3 .",
    "this is done at the expense of compactness of the final design .",
    "hence , relaxing the constraint on size allows us to create a new family of otma designs ( cf appendix a ) . again , one design ( named otma2 ) is drawn randomly from this new family .",
    "its fundamental parameters are given in table [ tmafundotma ] .",
    "this design is scaled by scale - factor 2.6 to obtain the utma2 design .",
    "the constructional parameters for utma2 are shown in table [ tmaconstoparam ] .",
    "the otma1 and utma2 are chosen for optimization and image quality analysis .",
    "lllllll design & @xmath2[m ] & @xmath3 & @xmath4[m ] & b[m ] & @xmath5[m ] + otma1 & 0.60 & 1.00 & 10.25 & 0.96 & 0.46 + scaled otma1 & 1.50 & 0.40 & 10.25 & 0.96 & 0.46 + otma2 & 0.60 & 4.50 & 22.00 & 0.99 & 4.58 + scaled otma2 & 1.56 & 1.73 & 22.00 & 0.99 & 4.58 +            focal length of the primary mirror @xmath26 + focal length amplification of the two mirror system @xmath27 + logical variables defined @xmath28 and @xmath29 + for the equations to obtain the conic constants see @xcite .    choose a range of values for @xmath3 .",
    "this constraints the allowable values for @xmath30 between 0.8@xmath31@xmath32@xmath30@xmath32 0.9@xmath31 . using the relations in table [ tmaconsteqn ] the minimum value of @xmath4 that satisifies @xmath33 and",
    "@xmath34 can be found .",
    "it is given by equation . and",
    "the maximum value for @xmath4 is arbitrarily set at 2@xmath1 .",
    "@xmath35 we have three parameters which can take a range of values \\{@xmath3,@xmath30,@xmath4}. the value of b can be obtained from the relations in table [ tmaconsteqn ] . the value of @xmath5 can be found using the petzval condition for flat focal plane .",
    "there are two possible solution for @xmath5 , positive or negative .",
    "the positive value is chosen , so that the the design can be folded .",
    "the range of @xmath3 values chosen for the otma design lie between 0.5 and 1.5 . and for the utma design it is 4.5 - 5.5 . using the equations above a large set of @xmath30 , @xmath4 b and @xmath5",
    "are obtained .",
    "the fundamental parameters are then used to obtain the constructional parameters .",
    "a few designs are randomly chosen from the large set and modeled in the optical design program zemax to study their characteristics ."
