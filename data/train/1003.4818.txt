    "the dynamics of a linear gravity wave is described by the _ taylor  goldstein equation _ ( tge ) .",
    "this equation is derived from the full , 3-d hydrodynamics equations @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we restrict the description to two dimensions and neglect rotation :    [ hydroeqn ] @xmath7    where @xmath8 ; @xmath9 is the flow in the horizontal and vertical directions @xmath10 , respectively ; @xmath11 is the density ; @xmath12 ) ; @xmath13 is the pressure ; @xmath14 is the gravity ; @xmath15 is the potential temperature ; @xmath16 is the specific heat at constant pressure ; @xmath17 is the sensible temperature ; and @xmath18 is the net diabatic heating rate .",
    "equations  ( [ hydroeqn ] ) are supplemented with the ideal gas law : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the specific gas constant .",
    "note that @xmath21 where @xmath22 is some reference pressure ( here taken to be the pressure at the lower boundary of the model ) and @xmath23 ; @xmath15 is related to the entropy @xmath24 by @xmath25 .",
    "the neglect of the third dimension and rotation requires that we restrict our analysis to waves with horizontal scale @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the characteristic mean flow speed and @xmath28 is the planetary rotation rate .",
    "this scale is adequate for all gravity waves , except for large - scale tides ( which has been recently considered by @xcite ) . as an example , @xmath29  m for hd209458b , based on @xmath27 in hot extrasolar planet simulations of @xcite .",
    "the resulting value is approximately 1/10 of the planet s radius .",
    "in addition , @xmath30 , @xmath20 , and @xmath16 are taken to be constant and @xmath18 is specified .",
    "these restrictions do not mitigate the basic application and implications presented in this work .",
    "however , for broader applications , relaxation of these and other restrictions will be considered in future work .",
    "the variables in equations  ( [ hydroeqn ] ) are all expanded as a small perturbation about a mean value , which is a function of height only : @xmath31 for the thermodynamic variables , we require that @xmath32 ; however , this is not required for the flow variables , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the mean state is assumed to be in hydrostatic balance , @xmath35 , and contains only horizontal flow so that @xmath36 .",
    "we also assume the anelastic approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath37 .",
    "this implies the following :    [ anelas ] @xmath38    where @xmath39^{1/2}$ ] is the brunt ",
    "visl  frequency ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the density and pressure scale heights , respectively ; @xmath42 is the ratio of specific heats , with @xmath43 the specific heat at constant volume ; @xmath44 is the speed of sound ; and , @xmath45 is the vertical scale of the motion .    with ( [ expan ] ) and ( [ anelas ] ) , we obtain    [ linear ] @xmath46    where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "since the coefficients in equation  ( [ linear ] ) are independent of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we assume perturbations of the form , @xmath51 where it is understood that the real part is to be taken .",

    "now , transforming to a new variable so that the effect of decreasing density with height is compensated ,    [ eq : newvar ] @xmath56    where @xmath57 is @xmath58 at the bottom , we obtain the tge : @xmath59 here , @xmath60 is the index of refraction , and corresponds to the local vertical wavenumber .",

    "the vertical structure of the perturbations , oscillating in @xmath58 , signify that we are dealing with _",
    "internal _ waves . in equation  ( [ eq : indref ] ) , the key terms contributing to @xmath63 are the first ( `` buoyancy '' ) term and the last ( `` non - hydrostatic '' ) term .",
    "although the other three terms contribute , generally the buoyancy and non - hydrostatic terms control whether the wave propagates since the flow shear and curvature are small and the scale height is large in practice . for large wavelength waves , the waves are hydrostatic and the non - hydrostatic term is small ; then , the buoyancy term dominates .",
    "in these cases , as long as the atmosphere is stratified ( i.e. , @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 , the wave will propagate vertically .",
    "however , for shorter , non - hydrostatic waves , it is possible that @xmath66 ^ 2 $ ] . in these cases , @xmath67 is imaginary and the wave does not propagate .",
    "this situation is discussed in more detail in  [ subsec : wbi ] .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : tge ] ) can be thought of as a driven harmonic oscillator equation .",
    "when @xmath67 is real and constant , its solution is a simple sinusoid .",
    "since the transformation , equation  ( [ eq : newvar ] ) , compensates for the exponential decay of density with height , @xmath34 grows ( decays ) rapidly with height ( depth ) .",
    "here , we have dropped the tilde overscript .",
    "from hereon we drop all tilde overscripts and `` 1 '' subscripts for notational clarity .",
    "the growth can be clearly seen in figure  [ fig : noshear ] , along with the corresponding constant stress ( vertical transport of horizontal momentum ) when there is no dissipation ( see   [ sec : saturation ] ) .",
    "if the temperature or the flow varies with height , @xmath67 is a function of height @xmath58 .",
    "if @xmath67 varies slowly , the wkb approximation @xcite can then be used to obtain @xmath68 here , @xmath69^{1/2}$ ] . as in the constant @xmath67 case ,",
    "the vertical perturbation velocity is wave - like with upwardly and downwardly propagating components ; the amplitude of the upward component grows with height and the downward component decays with depth .",
    "however , when @xmath67 varies rapidly , the solution must be obtained numerically .    at the boundaries we use the radiation condition , selecting the upwardly propagating solution at the top boundary @xmath70 and the downwardly propagating solution at the lower boundary @xmath71 .",
    "this is achieved using the condition , @xmath72 here , @xmath73 , depending on the signs of the horizontal and intrinsic phase speeds and on whether the condition is at the upper or lower boundary .",
    "note that condition  ( [ eq : bc ] ) requires the wkb approximation to be valid at the boundaries .",
    "for example , the boundaries can not be critical layers , regions where @xmath74 , since @xmath75 approaching such a layer and the wkb approximation ceases to be valid .",
    "critical layers will be discussed further below .",
    "as alluded to above , we use gaussian elimination @xcite in this work to numerically solve the tge . in the cases presented here , 3000",
    "equally spaced levels are employed to solve for @xmath34 .",
    "we have checked that this resolution is adequate by performing calculations with 10 , 000 levels and verifying convergence at the higher resolution .",
    "extensive validations against known analytic solutions , where they exist , have also been performed .",
    "the solution to the tge is a wave in the vertical velocity perturbation .",
    "this can be related to the horizontal and temperature ( sensible and potential ) perturbations .",
    "understanding these are essential for parameterizing the saturation process in the full non - linear situation and in general circulation models .",
    "the perturbation quantities can be obtained from the polarization equations @xcite :    [ eq : polar ] @xmath76 \\\\",

    "equation  ( [ eq : polar]a ) gives the relationship between the vertical and horizontal velocity perturbations .",
    "note that the amplitude of @xmath33 is larger than the amplitude of @xmath34 , as it is scaled by @xmath79 .",
    "note also that the geopotential ( pressure ) perturbation varies with the background flow via the dependence on the intrinsic phase speed , according to equation  ( [ eq : polar]b ) .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : polar]c ) and ( [ eq : polar]d ) shows that the potential and sensible temperature perturbations , respectively , are both @xmath80 out of phase with the vertical velocity perturbation .",
    "but , the phase between @xmath33 and @xmath34 varies locally through their dependence on the background .",
    "gravity waves are an efficient means of transporting both momentum and energy .",
    "the ( perturbation ) momentum and energy fluxes are simply obtained from equations  ( [ eq : polar ] ) :    [ eq : flux ] @xmath81    in equations  ( [ eq : flux ] ) , @xmath82 is the vertical flux of horizontal momentum ( or , the wave stress ) ; @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the horizontal and vertical fluxes of energy , respectively ; and , the overline indicates an average over a wavelength , @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 are arbitrary complex functions and `` * '' denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "note that the energy fluxes depend on the background flow through their dependence on @xmath88 and @xmath77 .",
    "however , as can be seen in figures  [ fig : noshear ] and [ fig : excritlayer ] , the wave stress remains constant , away from the forcing and damping regions ",
    "saturation regions and critical layers .",
    "this is in accordance with the second eliassen ",
    "palm theorem @xcite , which expresses non - interaction of the disturbance in the absence of dissipation and forcing .    in figure",
    "[ fig : excritlayer ] , it is important to note that , where the fluxes are changing , the wave is interacting with the background flow in those regions .",
    "this should be contrasted with the behavior illustrated in figure  [ fig : noshear ] , where the stress is not changing .",
    "changes in the wave stress cause accelerations to the mean flow .",
    "correspondingly , changes in the energy fluxes cause the temperature of the region to change .",
    "the rates of these changes are given by    [ eq : rate ] @xmath89    in this case , the wave causes the background flow to accelerate from 350  m  s@xmath4 towards 500  m  s@xmath4 .    in the remainder of the paper , when speaking of vertically propagating waves , we consider only waves that propagate upwards from the region of excitation .",
    "however , it must be remembered that downward propagating waves are also generated . on a giant planet without a solid surface , those waves may not be reflected or absorbed .",
    "they can continue to penetrate downward until they encounter a critical level or a convective region . or ,",
    "they are simply dissipated since the amplitudes of the downwardly propagating waves decrease exponentially , as already discussed ( and as also can be seen in figure  [ fig : excritlayer ] ) .",
    "the energy and momentum fluxes are linked by the first eliassen ",
    "palm theorem @xcite : @xmath90 which can be derived from equations  ( [ eq : polar ] ) and ( [ eq : flux ] ) . for downwardly propagating waves",
    ", we have @xmath91 ; and , therefore , via equations  ( [ eq : ep1 ] )  and  ( [ eq : rate]a ) , we see that for these waves the deposition of momentum also leads to acceleration of the flow toward the phase speed of the wave .",
    "downwardly propagating planetary scale gravity waves ( i.e. , thermally excited tides ) are considered by @xcite .      the present work concerns inviscid , linear , monochromatic waves .",
    "such waves are infinite in extent and , in principle , can grow without limit when they propagate upward .",
    "this is obviously not physical . in reality , such waves become unstable and saturate .",
    "the saturation process can be treated by introducing a correction to the solution according to the physical criterion , @xmath92 ensuring that a wave does not become convectively unstable and remains at neutral stability .",
    "when the saturation region is identified , @xmath15 is adjusted so that neutral stability is maintained .",
    "this new value for @xmath15 is then used in equation  ( [ eq : polar]c ) to obtain the corresponding @xmath34 in the saturated wave .",
    "this value of @xmath34 is then used in equations  ( [ eq : polar]a , b , c ) , ( [ eq : flux ] ) and ( [ eq : rate ] ) .",
    "this saturation condition acquires the simple form , @xmath93 in situations where the wkb approximation is valid @xcite .    as can be seen from the definitions of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath15 , the brunt ",

    "@xmath94 is a constant . in general , the fractional change of @xmath17 with height is small compared to @xmath98 throughout the modeled region .",
    "hence , @xmath94 is nearly constant in the entire domain , with a value that is roughly @xmath99  s@xmath4 .",
    "the brunt ",
    "visl  frequency for our atmospheric profile is shown in figure  [ fig : flowtempprof ] .",
    "further discussion of the effects of variation in @xmath94 are presented in ",
    "[ subsubsec : background ] .",
    "if the background flow contains shear , it is possible for the wave to encounter a critical layer at some height . at the critical level ,",
    "where @xmath100 , the tge becomes singular .",
    "however , the equation can be solved using the method of frobenius @xcite , from which it is seen that the wave is drastically attenuated by the critical layer @xcite .",
    "the amount of attenuation depends on the richardson number @xmath101 of the flow , @xmath102    figure  [ fig : excritlayer ] illustrates a critical layer encountered by a wave . if the wave stress has magnitude @xmath82 below the critical layer , it then has magnitude , @xmath103^{1/2 } \\right\\}$ ] , after the encounter with the critical layer @xcite .",
    "this is a substantial amount of attenuation .",
    "for example , in our model atmosphere of figure  [ fig : excritlayer ] , @xmath104 .",
    "hence , the wave is essentially completely dissipated at the critical level , with the wave stress falling to practically zero and the momentum deposited into the mean flow .",
    "note that , during its approach to the critical layer , the wave actually saturates and deposits momentum and energy over a finite layer ( cf . ,",
    "figure  [ fig : excritlayer ] ) .",
    "it is important to note that while a wave saturates when approaching a critical layer , the presence of a critical layer is _ not _ required for saturation .",
    "saturation is a general process referring to wave dissipation by many different mechanisms ",
    "radiation , conduction , breaking , and turbulence .",
    "numerically , when a critical layer is present , we lift the phase speed from the real axis by adding a small imaginary component : @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
    "this introduces a small amount of linear damping and ensures that the neglected nonlinear terms do not dominate in the regions where waves become steep and eventually break . of course , adding damping causes the wave - stress to decrease with height and the second eliassen - palm theorem to be no longer valid .",
    "however , the effect is small .",
    "this can be seen in figure  [ fig : excritlayer ] , where the wave stress falls negligibly over the layer from @xmath107 to @xmath108 .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to demonstrate several properties of gravity waves likely to be important for hot extrasolar planets . for this",
    ", we choose hd209458b  as a paradigm planet .",

    "we consider small- and meso - scale thermally excited waves , rather than large - scale waves , as already discussed .",
    "the horizontal wavelengths used in this work are 2500  km or less .",
    "this is a reasonable range since it is well within the observed range of gravity waves on jupiter @xcite .",
    "although not unimportant , we do not dwell on the precise nature of the source of the excitations .",
    "the main interest here is in the propagation and deposition of momentum and energy .",
    "the forcing in equation  ( [ eq : tge ] ) is simply represented as a gaussian , modified so that it is zero beyond two half - widths above and below the center .",
    "the center is located at @xmath110 above the bottom of the domain .",
    "the half - width is 75  km , or @xmath111 .",
    "the forcing location and width are chosen so that the vertical scale of the forcing is less than the vertical wavelength of the waves we present here .",
    "we have extensively explored the effects of varying the location , width , and strength of forcing and present this case to illustrate several important points . not surprisingly , the dynamics do depend on the chosen parameter values , but the dependence is broadly predictable .",
    "for example , if the forcing scale is much larger than the vertical wavelength , then only a very small amplitude wave is emitted from the forcing region , due to cancellations .",
    "the heating rate , @xmath112 , is set to 10@xmath3  k  s@xmath4 .",
    "note that this is a modest value .",
    "the forcing corresponds to roughly 300  k per rotation of the planet .",
    "this is compared to @xmath6100  k per rotation at the chosen location in the circulation model of @xcite .",
    "a forcing of @xmath61100  k per rotation , for a similar latitude - longitude location on the planet ( see  [ subsubsec : background ] ) , is used in @xcite .",
    "the latter value implies that , in the absence of motion , the location on the planet will cool completely in one rotation of the planet .",
    "we stress that locally  i.e .",
    ", scales far below the grid scale of the current circulation models  the forcing could actually be much stronger .",
    "the actual value is presently uncertain and likely to be spatially and temporally variable over the planet . to provide a context , for the earth",
    "the heating rate is @xmath113  k per day ( 1 day = 0.29 rotation of hd209458b ) over large areas ; but , locally , at the tops of low clouds on the earth the rate can be up to @xmath114  k per day @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : flowtempprof ] shows the mean flow and temperature profiles used to obtain much of the results presented in this section . the lower part of both profiles  approximately the lower six scale heights  is taken from global circulation simulations of the hot extrasolar giant planet hd209458b  by @xcite , using the ncar community atmosphere model @xcite .",
    "the profile is from a point near the equator , slightly away from the substellar point ( 70@xmath115e,10@xmath115n ) .",
    "this point was chosen as it is within the equatorial jet and the coriolis parameter @xmath116 is not large .",
    "the temperature profile generally increases with height over the lowest 4 scale heights and then becomes isothermal .",
    "fortuitously , this provides an opportunity for a loose validation of our model : it is very similar to the temperature structure observed by the galileo probe in the same region of jupiter s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "we extend the profile by keeping the temperature isothermal through the planet s stratosphere and having the thermosphere ( beginning of the temperature inversion near the top ) start between 12 and 13 scale heights at @xmath117  bar .",
    "this profile has a richardson number of at least 3.4 , giving an attenuation of @xmath118 .",
    "hence , any critical layer can be considered to fully dissipate the wave .",
    "the chosen flow profile has two local flow velocity maxima .",
    "the upper maximum is extended into a jet with a peak at @xmath119 .",
    "this is similar to the structure of the jet in jupiter s stratosphere proposed by @xcite , which has a peak velocity between the 10@xmath5 and 10@xmath3  bar levels .",
    "we then extend the profile further upwards without shear .",
    "note , this is in keeping with the lower boundary of the model of @xcite .",
    "the structure is somewhat different than those of @xcite , where there is just one jet with the peak approximately located at the 10@xmath4  bar level .",
    "the peak flow speed is also much greater in those studies at 4 or 5  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "it is important to note , however , that these differences do not change qualitatively the basic points we are making in this paper .",
    "the brunt ",
    "visl  frequency profile @xmath120 is also shown in figure  [ fig : flowtempprof ] .",
    "as already discussed , the profile does not vary much over the whole domain : the maximum brunt ",
    "visl  frequency is just 1.2 times the minimum value .",
    "therefore , @xmath94 does not contribute much to the variation of the index of diffraction @xmath67 .",
    "the main contributor to the variation of @xmath67 is the variation of the intrinsic phase speed , which is derived from the large variation of flow speeds .",
    "this should be compared to the analogous terrestrial situation , where the range of flow speeds is much lower .",
    "this allows @xmath94 to have a larger effect on the variation of @xmath67 on the earth .",
    "figure  [ fig : realcritlayer ] shows a gravity wave encountering a critical level in the upper jet in figure  [ fig : flowtempprof ] .",
    "the wave has a horizontal wavelength , @xmath121 , of 2500  km and @xmath122  m  s@xmath4 .",
    "here , since @xmath123 as the wave approaches the critical layer from below , the momentum deposited in the mean flow causes the mean flow to accelerate .",
    "this acceleration peaks at over 250  m  s@xmath4 per rotation .",
    "this is large enough to double the flow speed at this layer in @xmath62  rotations  a significant effect .",
    "the effect is large enough to require its inclusion in any simulation of the atmospheric circulation @xcite .",
    "the waves encountering critical layers are dissipated .",
    "therefore , a flow with a range of flow speeds dissipates all gravity waves with phase speeds within this range .",
    "that is , a spectrum of gravity waves is prevented from propagating high into the atmosphere .",
    "there are other , secondary effects at the critical layer that may also affect the mean flow ; but , they are not modeled here .",
    "they will form the basis of future work .",
    "for example , the deposition of energy into the flow at the critical layer may well lead to the generation of new gravity waves , which then may propagate further , partly mitigating the filtering effect .",
    "figure  [ fig : realsaturate ] shows an example of a gravity wave saturating in the atmosphere of figure  [ fig : flowtempprof ] . in general , it is possible that a wave may not encounter a critical level as it propagates upward .",
    "however , such a wave then travels higher into the atmosphere , where it grows large and , if unabated , eventually breaks or suffers dissipation at higher altitudes .",
    "although both momentum and energy are deposited in this case , we focus here on the effects on the temperature field .",
    "the wave launched in figure  [ fig : realsaturate ] has @xmath124  m  s@xmath4 ( i.e. , westward ) .",
    "the horizontal wavelength remains at 2500  km , as in the critical layer example of figure  [ fig : realcritlayer ] .",
    "the vertical velocity perturbation grows with height .",
    "therefore , so do the zonal velocity perturbation @xmath33 and the potential temperature perturbation @xmath15 , as expected from equation  ( [ eq : polar ] ) . in this case , the wave saturates near the top of the jet , where condition  ( [ eq : satcrit1 ] ) is exactly satisfied . here , condition ( [ eq : satcrit2 ] ) is approximately satisfied since the zonal perturbation velocity and the intrinsic phase speed ( @xmath125 ) are both approximately 122  m  s@xmath4 .",
    "the saturation deposits energy that causes the atmosphere there to heat up .",
    "the heating is significant , peaking at @xmath126  k per rotation  a 5% change in one rotation . in the absence of other effects",
    ", the ambient temperature can be doubled in about 20 planetary rotations ( or orbits , assuming 1:1 spin - orbit synchronization ) .",
    "a wave that has a phase speed greater than the maximum flow speed will not encounter a critical layer .",
    "those with phase speeds close to , but still above , the maximum flow speed will , in general , saturate in the regions just below the maximum flow , as the intrinsic flow speed will be small in that region .",
    "similarly , waves with phase speeds just less than the minimum flow will saturate as well . in this way the filtering effect discussed above is extended beyond those waves with phase speeds equal to flow speeds .",
    "the main effect of these filtered waves on the flow will be lower in the atmosphere . in the profile given in figure [ fig : flowtempprof ] , where the waves emanate from the @xmath110 level , this means that the upper layers of the lower jet will be slowed by gravity waves whereas the lower levels of the upper jet will be accelerated",
    ".    those waves that do not dissipate will be able to propagate into the upper atmosphere depositing their momentum and heat there . here",
    "the changes to the flow can be very large .",
    "for example , the wave shown in figure  [ fig : realsaturate ] causes a deceleration of up to 6.8  km  s@xmath4  rotation@xmath4 as it saturates .",
    "this clearly dominates the flow at this level .    moving the location of the wave origin down does not change the basic behavior in the qualitative sense . however , the amplitudes are much larger , compared with the case when the wave originates higher up in altitude .",
    "thus , the possibility exists for stronger effects due to gravity wave interaction with the background .",
    "this is illustrated in figures  [ fig : flowtempprofdeep ] and [ fig : realsaturatedeep ] , which should be compared with figures  [ fig : flowtempprof ] and [ fig : realsaturate ] .",
    "here , we have extended the profiles downwards .",
    "the wave is still launched at @xmath110 , but this is now deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "the wave again has a phase speed of @xmath127  m  s@xmath4 , and the horizontal wavelength remains at 2500  km .",
    "this wave also saturates near the top of the upper jet , where the energy deposition into the mean flow causes the atmosphere there to heat up .",
    "note that the region of heating is lower than when the wave originates higher up , as in figure [ fig : realsaturatedeep ] .",
    "the heating is significant , peaking at @xmath128  k  rotation@xmath4 .",
    "the ambient temperature can be doubled in approximately half of a planetary rotation . in a more realistic scenario , dissipation  which we have not included in our model ",
    "will likely reduce the heating rate .",
    "so far we have been focusing on the vertical transport of momentum and energy by gravity waves . however , the waves can also transport momentum and energy _ horizontally _ ( cf . , ",
    "[ subsubsec : ducting ] ) .",
    "substituting @xmath129 into the the index of refraction , equation  ( [ eq : indref ] ) , and rearranging gives the dispersion relation for gravity waves .",
    "here , we consider the case where @xmath130 .",
    "we will examine cases where @xmath131 in the sections following this one .",
    "when there is no background mean flow , the dispersion relation simplifies to @xmath132^{1/2}}.\\ ] ] we can then use the definitions ,    [ eq : grpvel ] @xmath133    to obtain the group velocities .",
    "they are :    [ eq : noflowgrpvel ] @xmath134}{\\left[k^2 + m^2 + 1/(4h^2_{\\rho})\\right]^{3/2 } } \\\\",
    "w_g & \\ = \\ & \\pm\\frac{n k m}{\\left[k^2 + m^2 + 1/(4h^2_{\\rho})\\right]^{3/2}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    thus , for propagating waves ( i.e. , waves for which @xmath67 is real ) , @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , gravity waves always propagate obliquely and can not strictly propagate vertically when there is no background flow .    from equations  ( [ eq : noflowgrpvel ] )",
    "we see that @xmath136 , the angle of propagation with respect to the horizontal , is given by @xmath137 since @xmath138 is nearly constant , with a value just under 500  km , @xmath139 varies with @xmath140 for @xmath141  m@xmath4 .",
    "this gives rise to refraction .",
    "as a wave propagates into a region of higher @xmath67 , it bends to a more horizontal path .",
    "note that , as we are here considering a region with no flow , increasing @xmath67 is essentially equivalent to increasing @xmath94 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : flowtempprof ] , @xmath94 increases in the thermosphere and so the paths of waves in this region will bend towards the horizontal even though the flow is small .      from equation  ( [ eq : wkbsoln ] ) we can see that in regions where @xmath67 is imaginary , the wave is evanescent : its amplitude decays towards zero and therefore it does not propagate vertically .",
    "this can occur when @xmath142 ( i.e. , when the atmosphere is convectively unstable ) .",
    "but , it can also occur for non - hydrostatic waves when the buoyancy term becomes dominated by the non - hydrostatic term .",
    "in addition , when the index of refraction changes between layers , the wave is reflected at the boundary .",
    "the amount of reflection is given by the magnitude of the coefficient of reflection @xmath143 , where @xmath144 in equation  ( [ eq : coeff_reflect ] ) , @xmath145 and @xmath146 are the indices of refraction in two adjacent layers .",
    "when @xmath146 is imaginary , total reflection occurs and the wave is evanescent in that region and its amplitude decays to zero .",
    "however a region of propagation can exist between two regions of evanescence .",
    "this readily occurs for jets , where the intrinsic phase speed varies enough to allow the hydrostatic term to dominate in some regions and not in others .",
    "the region can also occur through variations of the brunt ",
    "visl  frequency . in figure",
    "[ fig : realtrapped ] we see a wave that is trapped in the relatively quiescent region between @xmath107 and @xmath147 . outside this region ,",
    "the value of re@xmath148 is small , or zero .",
    "trapped in this region the wave is able to interact with itself and , under appropriate conditions , resonate .",
    "this is another mechanism via which waves may be filtered out by the flow ; and so the waves do not reach high altitudes at which saturation can occur . however , in this case , a trapped wave does not directly interact with a low level flow that changes its characteristics . indeed , between the two reflection layers the wave can propagate horizontally  even in the absence of any flow , using the refractive mechanism described above .",
    "as long as the layers do not allow much leakage , it is possible for a trapped wave to cover large horizontal distances  transporting momentum and heat zonally ( east - west direction ) .      as well as being trapped in relatively quiescent regions ,",
    "it is possible for waves to be trapped in a jet . as alluded to above , it is possible for such a wave to travel within the region of trapping , which is known as a duct or a waveguide . in figure",
    "[ fig : realducted ] , a non - hydrostatic wave with @xmath149  m  s@xmath4 is trapped within the jet ( located at @xmath65  mbar level ) in our model atmosphere .",
    "note the small values of re@xmath148 outside the jet .    in this case , the flows are significant .",
    "therefore , we use the full dispersion relation , +    @xmath150 \\\\ \\pm 2\\left[h^2_{\\rho}k^2\\left(\\left(1 + 4h^2_{\\rho}\\left(k^2+m^2\\right)\\right)n^2 + \\left(u_0'+h_{\\rho}u_0''\\right)^2\\right)\\right]^{1/2}}{1 + 4h^2_{\\rho}\\left(k^2+m^2\\right ) } \\ , , \\ ] ]    to develop expressions for the group velocities .    however , the expressions obtained are large and rather unilluminating",
    ". they can be simplified by assuming that @xmath151 and @xmath152 are small .",
    "this is realistic since the shear is of the order of @xmath153  s@xmath4 and @xmath152 of the order @xmath154",
    "m@xmath4  s@xmath4 .",
    "this is small compared with the other terms in the expressions .",
    "this then gives    @xmath155}{\\left[k^2 + m^2 + 1/(4h^2_{\\rho})\\right]^{3/2 } } \\\\",
    "w_g & \\ = \\ & \\pm\\frac{n k m}{\\left[k^2 + m^2 + 1/(4h^2_{\\rho})\\right]^{3/2 } }       \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from these expressions , we can see that @xmath156 follows @xmath157 as this is the larger term on the right hand side of equation  ( [ eq : grphorvelflow ] ) in our model atmosphere . in figure",
    "[ fig : realducted ] , the values of @xmath156 and @xmath158 are shown .",
    "note that in the center of the duct @xmath158 is very small while @xmath156 is large , so that energy is transported along the flow . at the the top and bottom of the duct the vertical group velocity increases , while the horizontal group velocity falls .",
    "therefore , propagation here is nearly vertical . in figure",
    "[ fig : realducted ] , we show @xmath158 as positive , however this is only for the upward propagation of energy , at the top of the duct the wave is reflected and the vertical component becomes negative .",
    "this keeps the wave within the jet .",
    "the ray path followed by the wave , before the reflection , is shown in figure  [ fig : realductedpath ] .",
    "the wave can travel large distances in this duct ; but , eventually , the wave will either escape the duct or be dissipated .",
    "the range of speeds in the jet may change so that a critical level for the wave is created .",
    "the wave will then be reabsorbed into the flow . alternatively , if the flow or brunt  visl  frequency outside the jet changes so that the buoyancy term is no longer small and is dominated by the non - hydrostatic term , then the reflection is no longer total and the wave will then leak out of the duct .",
    "this can , for example , happen when propagating into a colder region , assuming the lapse rate remains constant . as can be seen from equation  ( [ eq : bvf ] )",
    "a fall in temperature with constant lapse rate will cause an increase in the brunt ",
    "visl  frequency and thus an increase in the buoyancy term .",
    "this may occur very far from the original region of wave excitation .",
    "indeed , in the example given , it is possible to envisage jets ducting waves and so transporting energy from the dayside of a tidally locked planet to the colder nightside where the waves escape the jet and propagate away from the duct before dissipating .",
    "the effects of gravity waves discussed in this work on the larger - scale circulation must be parameterized in global models because the spatial resolution  both horizontal and vertical  required to model them is currently prohibitive .",
    "the waves important to the large - scale extrasolar planet atmospheric circulation have horizontal length scales ranging from approximately @xmath159  m to @xmath160  m and vertical wavelengths as small as @xmath161  m. waves with periods of few hours can carry significant momentum and energy flux vertically , but the sources of these waves include processes that are not included or resolvable in current circulation models .",
    "the difficulty with representing gravity waves in gcms exists even for the gcms of the earth .",
    "for example , the parameterization for convection is not aimed at producing realistic gravity waves @xcite .",
    "however , not representing gravity waves can affect the accuracy of the gcms .",
    "the lack of gravity wave drag can lead to the overestimation of wind speeds , resulting in faster and narrower jets than observed @xcite .",
    "further , gravity waves introduce turbulence with subsequent mixing and thermal transport @xcite .",
    "this leads to greater homogenization of the atmosphere with a reduction in , for example , temperature gradients .",
    "gravity waves also interact with planetary waves , playing a role in important transient phenomena ( such as sudden stratospheric warming ) . in the absence of gravity waves ,",
    "these phenomena are not accurately modeled @xcite .",
    "there are many parametrization schemes currently incorporated or proposed for general circulation modeling @xcite . in all of the schemes , the basic components are 1 ) specification of the characteristic of the waves at the source level , 2 ) wave propagation and evolution as a function of altitude , and 3 ) effects on and by the atmosphere .",
    "all of them are essentially linear and one - dimensional , in that waves only propagate vertically and that only vertical variation in the background influence the propagation . as seen in this work , linear theory still requires information such as the wave s phase speed @xmath162 and wavenumber @xmath163 , for example .",
    "a more complete theory would need spatial and temporal spectral information .",
    "intermittency is another crucial feature that would need to be taken into account .",
    "the primary differences in various schemes pertain to the treatment of nonlinearity and specificity of wave dissipation mechanisms .    currently , all global circulation models of hot jupiters suggest the presence of a low number of zonal jets . however , all the models do not have the resolution required to adequately resolve gravity waves and are subject to all of the limitations described above .",
    "this issue has been previously raised by @xcite , in which they advocate caution against quantitative interpretation of current model results .",
    "for example , without the inclusion of the wave effects discussed in this work , high jet speeds and precise eastward shift of putative `` hot spots '' can be questioned ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * )",
    "gravity wave propagation and momentum and energy deposition are complicated by the environment in which the wave propagates .",
    "for example , spatial variability of the background winds causes the wave to be refracted , reflected , focused , and ducted . additionally , temporal variability of the background winds cause the wave to alter its phase speed .",
    "still further complications arise due to the wave s ability to generate turbulence , which can modify the source or serve as a secondary source , and the wave s interaction with the vortical ( rotational ) mode of the atmosphere .",
    "many of these issues are as yet not well - understood and are currently areas of active research .    in this work ,",
    "we have emphasized only some of these issues .",
    "we have shown that gravity waves propagate and transport momentum and heat in the atmospheres of hot extrasolar planets and that the waves play an important role in the atmosphere .",
    "they modify the circulation through exerting accelerations on the mean flow whenever the wave encounters a critical level or saturates .",
    "they also transport heat to the upper stratosphere and thermosphere , causing significant heating in these regions .",
    "moreover , through ducting , they also provide a mechanism for transporting heat from the dayside of tidally synchronized planets .    before relying on gcms for quantitative descriptions of hot extrasolar planet atmospheric circulations ,",
    "further work needs to be performed to ensure that the effects of important sub - scale phenomena , such as the gravity waves discussed here , are accurately parameterized and included in the gcms .",
