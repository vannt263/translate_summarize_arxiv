    "the four - image gravitational lens class b1608 + 656 was one of the first lenses discovered in class ( @xcite ) .",
    "follow - up radio and optical imaging showed the four - component morphology at all wavelengths .",
    "in addition , hst multicolor imaging showed the presence of two lensing galaxies as well as lensed arcs and a faint einstein ring ( see images in @xcite and on the castles web page at http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/glensdata/ ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations have given the redshifts of the lensing galaxies and the lensed background source , which is a post - starburst radio galaxy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . with the numerous observational constraints from the hst imaging and evidence of radio variability from early vla observations , this system presented an excellent possibility to be used for a determination of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , a program of vla monitoring was started in late 1996 .",
    "the results of the first season of vla monitoring , between 1996 october and 1997 may , are presented in fassnacht et al .",
    "we measured the three independent time delays in the system from the monitoring data , yielding @xmath2 at 95% confidence .",
    "the time delays were combined with the model presented in koopmans & fassnacht ( 1999 ) to yield @xmath3 km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 ( 95% confidence ) with an additional uncertainty of @xmath5 km  s@xmath4  mpc@xmath4 from the modeling .",
    "the uncertainties on the measured time delays , and hence on the resulting determination of @xmath0 are rather large because the background source flux density varied by only @xmath6 during the first season of monitoring . in principle , stronger variations should allow the alignment of the light curves more accurately , thus leading to smaller uncertainties in the measured time delays . for this reason",
    ", a second season of monitoring was begun .",
    "these proceedings present initial results from the second season of monitoring .",
    "we observed the b1608 + 656 system at 8  ghz with the vla between february and october 1998 .",
    "the system was observed 80 times during this period , with observations made , on average , every 3.1  d. with the exception of using the source 1634 + 627 as the primary flux calibrator instead of 3c286 , the data reduction procedure was the same as described in fassnacht et al .",
    "the final light curves for the four b1608 + 656 components show large variations in flux density , on the order of 40% ( fig .",
    "these variations are quite a contrast to the variations of only @xmath15% seen in the light curves from the first season of monitoring .",
    "however , the nature of the variations , a nearly monotonic decline , introduces a degeneracy in magnification - delay space , making it difficult to align the curves accurately . in order to break this degeneracy ,",
    "we have conducted a joint analysis of the data from the first two seasons .",
    "this approach is useful because the nearly constant light curves from the first season limit the allowed range in magnification while the steeply declining second season curves limit the allowed range of delays .",
    "an initial @xmath7 minimization analysis ( see fassnacht et al .  1999 for a description of the details ) produces much clearer minima than those produced from the first - season data alone ( fig .",
    "we also conducted monte carlo simulations to estimate the uncertainties on the delays .",
    "as hoped , the uncertainties decreased by 30  50% .",
    "the delays produced by this initial analysis are thus @xmath8 at 95% confidence .",
    "the delays derived from the joint analysis are consistent within the errors with those produced from the first season .",
    "however , there is a systematic shift to lower delays , which is especially noticeable for the shortest delay .",
    "this change may be due to small errors in matching the absolute flux densities of the curves between the two seasons , an effect that is being investigated further .",
    "composite curves created by shifting the component light curves by these delays are presented in fig .  2 .",
    "the b1608 + 656 system has produced a measurement of @xmath0 through a combination of the measured time delays with a mass model for the lensing galaxies . however , the uncertainties in both the lens model and the measured delays are still larger than desired .",
    "future work on this system could reduce the uncertainties in both of these areas . on the modeling side , blandford and surpi are developing a new lens model using the full information in the hst images of the system .",
    "the time delay uncertainties also can be reduced if the source varies in a strong , but non - monotonic , manner .",
    "it should be noted that just such a variation occurred during the gap between the first two seasons when the source began its change from its previous , nearly constant , flux density .",
    "this change in behavior was missed because the vla was in its compact configurations and could not resolve the individual source components .",
    "we are currently conducting a third season of monitoring with the vla to search for more variability in the background source .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities inc .",
    "this work is supported in part by the nsf under grant # ast 9420018 and by the european commission , tmr program , research network contract erbfmrxct96 - 0034 `` ceres . ''"
