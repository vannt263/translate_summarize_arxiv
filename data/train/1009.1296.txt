    "the study of the earliest stages of star formation is intrinsically connected to the ability to probe the dusty regions within which stars are born .",
    "the short wavelength radiation from deeply embedded young stellar objects is absorbed by the dust and reaches the observer as re - processed far infrared ( fir ) and submillimeter ( submm ) emission .",
    "the low optical depth at these longer wavelengths makes submm studies the best tool to investigate the clumps and inner cores ( @xmath9pc ; @xcite ) that produce new stars , especially the ` coldest ' structures prior to the onset of stellar activity .",
    "the 2-m balloon - borne large - aperture submillimeter telescope ( blast ; @xcite ) , with two consecutive and successful science missions in 2005 and 2006 , mapped the sky simultaneously at the crucial wavelength bands of 250 , 350 , and 500 .",
    "the galactic ( e.g. , @xcite ) and extragalactic ( e.g. , @xcite ) data provided by the blast mission demonstrate the exciting science to be continued with the _ _ herschel space observatory__(hereafter _ herschel _ ; e.g. , @xcite ) and its spire instrument ( @xcite ; @xmath10  at 250 ) .",
    "in this study we present a preliminary analysis of the 6 deg@xmath0 field of a massive star forming region in aquila ( @xmath11@xmath2 , @xmath12@xmath2 ) , observed by blast during its 2005 flight .",
    "this work therefore complements the analysis of the other blast05 galactic plane star forming regions , including vulpecula ( @xcite ) and cygnus x ( roy et al . in preparation ) .",
    "aquila is well known for its prominent massive star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and is dominated by two main molecular complexes .",
    "these are host to numerous ultracompact regions ( uchiirs ; e.g. , @xcite ; [ wc89 ] ) , maser emission , and outflows from young and highly embedded ob stellar clusters .",
    "the stellar activity of the galactic ring survey molecular cloud ( grsmc ) 45.60 + 0.30 has been extensively studied in the infrared and radio ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , although submm data have also been used to complement the detailed study of this cloud ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the overall population and properties of this entire region in aquila are yet to be fully characterized at submm wavelengths .",
    "previous blast studies of regions like vulpecula @xcite and vela @xcite have provided robust samples of submm sources in a range of evolutionary stages . by fitting modified blackbody spectral energy distributions ( seds ) to the blast measurements , and with the aid of ancillary data at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths for the vulpecula sources ( including _ iras _ , _ spitzer _ mips , and the _ midcourse space experiment _ ( _ msx _ ) ) , these studies constrained dust temperatures , masses and bolometric luminosities for their respective samples .",
    "their results aimed to characterize and investigate crucial properties of the submm population , including their star formation stage , the ( core ) mass function , and core lifetimes ( vela ) .    in this paper",
    "we provide the first general characterization of the submm clump population of aquila , which will serve as the initial census and preliminary analysis of those structures that will be observed in more detail by _ herschel _ during its surveys of the massive star forming regions in the galactic plane ( hi - gal : the _ herschel _ infrared galactic plane survey ; @xcite ) . like in previous blast studies ,",
    "we provide estimates of physical parameters such as mass , dust temperature , and luminosity , although in this work this analysis is constrained to the most prominent clumps in the field , lying at the common distance of @xmath4kpc (   [ distest ] ) .",
    "we have complemented our submm analysis with a detailed study of the uchiirs and ob clusters within these main clumps with the aid of 4.8ghz radio interferometry data provided by the co - ordinated radio ` n ' infrared survey for high - mass star formation ( cornish ; @xcite ) . in   [ sec : obs ] we describe the submm and radio data used in this work , as well as the techniques required to produce our final results .",
    "we then analyze the major clouds and clumps in the region (   [ sec : sources ] ) , whose properties we discuss in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] . in ",
    "[ sec : end ] we give a brief summary of our results and the prospects for future studies of this massive star forming region .",
    "blast observed aquila during its first science flight in june 2005 , mapping a total of @xmath13 deg@xmath0 ( @xmath1@xmath2@xmath3@xmath2 ) at 250 , 350 , and 500  towards grsmc 45.60 + 0.30 . for the following analysis we note that the three blast maps were made such that the average of these maps is zero @xcite . during the reduction and mapmaking process , the sanepic ( signal and noise estimation procedure ) algorithm removed low - frequency noise ( mainly sky signal ) .",
    "large scale signals in the map were recovered , but the dc level was set to zero by application of a high - pass filter to the time - ordered data .",
    "the reduction process , as well as the subsequent procedures to correct the unexpected optical degradation that occurred during the flight @xcite , have been described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the effective resolution is @xmath1440 , 50 , and 60  at 250 , 350 and 500 , respectively .",
    "the 250 and 350  maps were later convolved in order to produce blast maps with a common resolution of @xmath15  for photometry analysis .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fig : aquila ] , the final products still suffered from artifacts ( ripples ) surrounding the brightest objects and the map edges arising from the deconvolution process .",
    "these introduce false detections when running the interactive data language ( idl ) routines designed to detect the main submm peaks in the field , and which we therefore have to eliminate manually after visual inspection . for source identification we used the idl - implemented daophot ` find ' routine and a s / n detection limit of @xmath1 at 250 , the band with higher signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) for a typical star - forming clump .",
    "we kept a total of 66 sources between @xmath16@xmath2@xmath17 and @xmath18@xmath2@xmath19 ( to avoid map edges ) which also had a match at 350  within 20  with a s / n@xmath20 .",
    "we also kept six additional sources ( identified with ( * ) in table [ table : srcs ] ) with a lower s / n at 250 and 350  ( combined s / n between @xmath21 , visually prominent , and some with counterparts in the iras point source catalog ; psc ) .",
    "their lower s / n can be explained by their location in the local neighborhood of ( clustered ) bright sources , regions with difficult background estimation and significantly above average noise .",
    "this source catalog ( table [ table : srcs ] ) is robust to @xmath22jy at 350  ( @xmath23jy at 250 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the cirrus noise ( @xmath1@xmath24 ) at 250 , 350 and 500  is estimated to be @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27jy for each map , respectively @xcite . in the present work we did not require completeness to faint flux densities , however , choosing to focus our analysis only on the most prominent submm peaks of our sample .",
    "co radial velocities of 68 blast detections with molecular clump counterpart ( blast peak lying within spatial fwhm of clump ) in catalogs of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main stellar activity has velocities within the broad ( high velocity ) peak . ]      in order to investigate the velocities and distances towards the main clumps in the field we used the @xmath28co molecular spectra from the bu - fcrao galactic ring survey ( grs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the datasets cover the region between @xmath10@xmath2@xmath29@xmath2@xmath30 with a velocity resolution of 0.2 kms@xmath31 .",
    "the spatial resolution is 46  with an angular sampling of 22 . due to the distribution of the clumps throughout the field ,",
    "this spectral analysis is essential in order to estimate and justify the use of a suitable common distance to the most active regions in aquila .",
    "a comparison of blast with the molecular emission is shown in figure [ fig : molecular ] .",
    "to aid qualitative intercomparison , blast contours are presented in this and a number of later figures , from images in which an approximate dc level has been restored ( 300 , 160 , and 50mjysr@xmath31 at 250 , 350 , 500 , respectively ) .",
    "for the spectral analysis we first extracted and fitted the @xmath28co spectra at the position of each submm peak .",
    "molecular counterparts from the catalogs of @xcite and @xcite were assigned to each blast peak if the peak was located within the spatial fwhm of the molecular clump .",
    "the velocity we obtained from the spectral fitting was then compared with the clump velocities in the catalog .",
    "this allowed us to distinguish the appropriate molecular counterpart to the blast clump in those cases where more than one molecular counterpart ( but with different local standard of rest ( lsr ) radial velocity ) was found for a particular blast clump ( e.g. , table [ table : srcs ] ) .",
    "our analysis and line fitting of the spectra is in good agreement with the significant dispersion of velocities ( e.g. , figure [ fig : vels ] ) existing in the recent cloud / clump catalogs of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the main activity of the field is located in the main broad high - velocity peak in figure [ fig : vels ] .",
    "the smaller peak at lower velocities could arise from clumps located either much closer or much farther away ( @xmath32 or @xmath33kpc ; @xcite ) than the complexes forming the high - velocity peak ( which cluster around the tangent point of @xmath34kpc ; e.g. , @xcite ) .    using the @xcite rotation curve of the milky way , @xcite estimated distances to grs molecular clouds ( e.g. , @xcite ) with the aid of self - absorption ( hisa ) and continuum absorption , both in data from the very large array galactic plane survey ( vgps ; @xcite ) .",
    "there are four clouds in their sample within the defined blast map limits (   [ dproducts ] ) with an assigned distance between @xmath35kpc ( lsr velocity within the second peak in figure [ fig : vels ] : v@xmath36 kms@xmath31 ) : g045.49 + 00.04 , g045.74@xmath3700.26 , g045.89@xmath3700.36 , and g045.39@xmath3700.76 .",
    "however , one of the major clouds in the blast field , g045.14 + 00.14 ( v@xmath38 kms@xmath31 ) , has instead been assigned its near distance of @xmath39kpc .",
    "taking into account a maximum standard error of @xmath26% for the distances @xcite , we estimate that a common distance of @xmath4kpc would be a suitable approximation for the analysis of all the clouds with velocities of @xmath36 km s@xmath31 and located in this distance range .",
    "furthermore , this estimate is in good agreement with the distances derived by @xcite , who also resolved the kinematic distance ambiguities using self - absorption with data from the vgps .",
    "these authors calculated , by means of methanol masers and a flat rotation curve , a range of distances for the clumps within g045.49 + 00.04 between @xmath40 and @xmath41kpc , which again agrees well with the estimate from @xcite .",
    "however , they assigned the far distance of @xmath41kpc to the clump in g045.14 + 00.14 , which disagrees with @xcite .",
    "this coincides with previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) that placed this cloud at the same kinematic distance as its neighbor g045.49 + 00.04 . in this paper",
    "we adopt the far distance estimate of @xcite for g045.14 + 00.14 , and we restrict our main analysis to four clouds ( g045.49 + 00.04 , g045.74@xmath3700.26 , g045.89@xmath3700.36 , and g045.14 + 00.14 ) , which comprise the most active complexes of the field .",
    "our main blast detections corresponding to g045.39@xmath3700.76 are associated with a bubble @xcite , separate from the main clouds of the field , and we therefore omit these sources from the main analysis .",
    "a common distance of @xmath4kpc ( @xmath42@xmath2@xmath43kpc scale ) is assumed in the present study ( in contrast with those used by previous authors of @xmath34 and @xmath44kpc ; e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .      to create our seds we used the blast fluxes estimated using our own gaussian fitting routine (   [ photo ] ) .",
    "whenever possible , we also included data from the _ iras _",
    "galaxy atlas ( iga ; @xcite : hires ; @xcite ) at 60 and 100  and bolocam  ( galactic plane survey ) data at 1.1 mm @xcite .",
    "_ iras _  flux densities were estimated individually using our gaussian fitting routine , while for the convolved ( 60 ) bolocam  images we used aperture photometry ( single sources : an aperture centered on the blast source with 1.8 radius ; an estimate for the background was obtained from an annulus formed by the source aperture and another aperture with radius 1.3 times larger than that of the source ) .",
    "the measured bolocam  fluxes were found to be within the error range of those provided by the gator service , and the latter values were therefore used to constrain the seds at longer wavelengths if a counterpart to the blast clump was found within 30  ( we found 39 sources in table [ table : srcs ] with bolocam  counterparts , including all those with measured seds , with the exception of a22 ) .",
    "we note that _ iras _",
    "was found to be saturated for the brightest clumps , for which we adopted the upper limits estimated by @xcite .",
    "most of our measured _ iras _",
    "fluxes were also found to be higher than those from the _ iras _  psc .",
    "this effect , combined with the lower resolution of _ iras _  and the photometry of sometimes blended sources , imply that these values should also be generally considered upper limits in our fits .",
    "to investigate the stellar content and the morphology of the emission at shorter wavelengths we used the infrared array camera ( irac ) on _ spitzer_. of the four available irac  bands ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ) , we focused on the longest wavelength in our morphology analysis . for our study of the stellar population we used data from the galactic legacy infrared midplane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ; @xcite ) through the online gator query system .",
    "the glimpse i online datasets , covering about 220 deg@xmath0 of the galactic plane ( @xmath49@xmath2@xmath50@xmath2 ) in all four irac  bands , include a highly reliable ( gr ) catalog and a more complete , but less reliable one ( gc ) .",
    "both were used in the present work .    ) .",
    "symbols are blast and ancillary data ( _ iras _ ; bolocam ) .",
    "upper and lower curves are the 1-sigma envelope of the dust emission model @xcite . ]",
    "similar to other galactic blast studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , our sed analysis was carried out by estimating flux densities with our own idl spatial gaussian - fitting routine , and subsequently fitting them with a modified blackbody of the form :    , but for a50 ( table [ table : srcs ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath51    where @xmath52 is the dust emissivity index , ( @xmath53)@xmath54 is the emissivity factor normalized at a fixed frequency @xmath55 , and @xmath56(@xmath57 ) is the planck function .",
    "the amplitude @xmath58 can be expressed as :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the distance to the source , @xmath61 is the total clump mass , @xmath62 is the dust mass absorption coefficient , evaluated at @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "a 2-d gaussian is fitted to the three bands simultaneously with the amplitudes , centroid , orientation angle , and major and minor full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) as free parameters .",
    "the fit is carried out using a non - linear least - squares minimization idl routine ( based on mpfit : @xcite ) , which also allowed for simultaneous multiple gaussian fitting in crowded regions of the field .",
    "the background was estimated by fitting a fourth - order polynomial to the regions around the clump .",
    "following @xcite , estimates and uncertainties for the dust temperatures , masses , and luminosities were obtained through a monte carlo analysis performed on our sed models , keeping the dust emissivities and @xmath64 as fixed parameters ( @xmath8 , @xmath65 , @xmath66@xmath67g@xmath31 ) .",
    "examples of seds are shown in figure [ fig : sed1 ] and figure [ fig : sed2 ] .",
    "a flux density consistency check between all convolved and deconvolved maps shows flux conservation to better than 5% .",
    "the bolometric luminosities derived from the fits for each evolved clump were subsequently used to estimate equivalent single zero - age - main - sequence star ( zams ) spectral types using the tables of @xcite .",
    "this luminosity value was used as a general measure of the energy output of each submm detection .",
    "we note that the blast sources at a distance of @xmath4kpc are pc - sized , and therefore ` clump - like ' objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we expect them to be powered by several embedded stars , with the luminosity dominated by that of the most massive source(s ) within the clump .",
    "in addition , we also include the equivalent luminosity class v star spectral types from the more recent stellar calibration provided by @xcite , which takes into account the effects of line - blanketing and winds in the non - lte atmosphere models of o stars . for this case we used the calibration based on the observational @xmath68 scale ; these authors note that the theoretical and observational scales are in good agreement for early type dwarfs and supergiants .      for our radio analysis we used the cornish interferometry datasets , a 4.8ghz vla survey covering the northern glimpse region with a resolution of @xmath32 .",
    "our analysis of these data was carried out using the same procedure and gaussian fitting codes used for the submm .",
    "the 4.8ghz fluxes from our fitting were then used to estimate the total number of ionizing photons per unit time for each radio source ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) :    @xmath69    where @xmath55 is the frequency at the lyman edge .",
    "these values were also used in conjunction with the tables from @xcite and @xcite to estimate the equivalent single - star radio spectral types for each detection .",
    "the positions and parameters derived using these data have been included in tables [ table : rsrcs ] , [ table : radio ] , and [ table : radio1 ] .",
    "the target s / n of our sample is @xmath20 . as with the blast sources , we have also kept a few radio detections with lower s / n .",
    "these were identified and required by our gaussian fitting routine , and are almost exclusively secondary peaks neighboring the brightest sources ( clusters : a16-c24 , a28-c15 ) , where the s / n is greatly deteriorated ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "this effect has already been discussed in @xcite , and these sources will therefore require further examination as soon as additional / better data becomes available .",
    "extra detections with low s / n have been identified ( * ) in table [ table : rsrcs ] .",
    "nomenclature of radio sources is formed by the name of the blast clump , followed by that of the cornish detection ( a#@xmath37c # ) .",
    "considering the uncertainties in our measurements and the above procedure for spectral type estimation , assuming optically thin emission , we estimate an uncertainty for these measurements of @xmath71 in spectral type ( for a given calibration scale of the stellar parameters ) .",
    "this uncertainty is expected to be larger than any spectral type error that could arise when comparing our estimates ( for a distance of @xmath4kpc ) and those obtained by previous authors with a distance of @xmath34 kpc ( tables [ table : radio ] and [ table : radio1 ] ) .",

    "several irdcs are observed in the local regions surrounding the brightest _ iras _  source formed by a28 and a29 , especially towards a29 .",
    "the intricate structures observed in the irac  images , such as the pillar - like structures coincident with this blast source and the ` cavity ' , will require submm data with higher resolution and sensitivity in order to be properly characterized . we find a similar situation for the submm complex labeled in figure [ fig : molecular ] as g046.34@xmath3700.21 , where the majority of the submm sources are identified as dark features in the irac  maps .",

    "figure [ fig : check ] shows the measured bolometric luminosity for our blast sources relative to the combined total number of ionizing photons per unit time for all cornish sources possibly associated with each submm source .",
    "the apparent underionizing state of a12 suggests optically thick radio emission , and therefore a highly embedded stage of the central sources .",
    "a28 likely contains the ` older ' stellar activity of the observed clumps , while a29 and a30 appear to have characteristics of a relatively ` younger ' population . the later spectral type obtained from the cornish data for the main complex in a30 ( the filamentary structure ) relative to its estimate from the ir would support the embedded stage of the main star forming activity in this region .",
    "although our total luminosity measurement ( and the radio estimates from @xcite ) are consistent with the theoretical curve in figure [ fig : check ] , the large error range in luminosity for aa30 relative to the uncertainty in @xmath225 could still support this conclusion .    despite the apparent agreement of aa29 ( a28+a29 ) with the theoretical models in figure [ fig : check ] , the more compact radio emission of a29 and the weak mir emission ( compared to the prominent submm peak ) would argue that a29 is the youngest active part of the entire cloud .",
    "@xcite suggested that g45.45 itself could have been triggered by three possible o - type stars ionizing the extended region g45l .",
    "although not analyzed in the present work , this is also a possibility for the original site ( ` first generation ' ) of the activity within the blast clump .",
    "a35 and a36 also have sed parameters consistent with on - going stellar activity , but lack obvious 4.8ghz detections .",
    "neither of these two sources show maser emission in the catalogs used in this work , and both have weaker @xmath28co and cs antenna temperature",
    ". these sources may thus be in a relatively young and still embedded stage , or the star forming activity may be low and/or without significant massive star formation .    of the three main submm peaks in the complex formed by g045.74@xmath3700.26 and g045.89@xmath3700.36 , a50 has the strongest molecular emission .",
    "it is also possibly associated water masers , and has a relatively symmetric ir , submm and radio configuration .",
    "this source appears to have at least one possibly associated 4.8ghz source , which would agree with previous studies that classified this source as an uchiir from the color criteria of wc89 .",
    "a46 shows the weakest molecular and radio emission , and no cornish counterparts or prominent signatures of star forming activity .",
    "however , the presence of methanol emission and the possible association with an ego suggest that this clump is in a very early and deeply embedded stage of massive star formation .",
    "a47 shows not only more extended emission at all wavelengths , but it also appears to contain a few associated cornish sources within the main region . the lack of any obvious maser emission , its morphology , the high dust temperatures , and weak molecular emission indicate that this clump has the most evolved stellar activity of the entire complex . the weak @xmath28co and cs antenna temperatures for this source could also be explained by the more evolved stage of the system .    from the results in figure [ fig : check ] ,",
    "both a47 and a50 appear to be underionizing for their luminosity .",
    "this could be an indication that the total luminosity has significant contribution from several ` cooler ' stars .",
    "however , the presence of water masers and cornish detections may still suggest that unaccounted very optically thick radio emission , from a new embedded generation of star formation in these clumps , could also be a possibility .",
    "by means of the submillimeter maps provided by blast at 250 , 350 , and 500 , together with irac  imaging , 21 cm continuum emission , 4.8ghz cornish radio interferometry data , and grs fcrao @xmath28co / cs molecular datacubes , we have characterized the main clump population in the region of aquila .    our sed fitting of the most prominent star - forming sources at a distance of @xmath4kpc has revealed clumps with temperatures ranging between @xmath376k and @xmath377k ( for @xmath8 ) .",
    "their total bolometric luminosities have equivalent single - star zams spectral types earlier than @xmath14b0 stars .",
    "the 4.8ghz interferometry maps have been used to investigate the uchiirs within the submm clumps .",
    "the zams spectral types estimated from the cornish data are overall in good agreement with previous results .",
    "the ` later ' types obtained for some sources relative to their ir estimates support our blast and maser / outflow analysis , which suggest that highly embedded young ob stellar clusters are powering the most active clumps in the region .",
    "on - going massive star formation is most prominent in g045.49 + 00.04 and g045.14 + 00.14 ( containing our blast sources a12 , a16 , and a28 , a29 , a30 , respectively ) .",
    "we confirm the presence of an ob stellar cluster deep within iras 19111 + 1048 ( a16 ) , containing a bright @xmath14o6 star surrounded by numerous late o and early b stars .",
    "this is in contrast with the scarcer maser and 4.8ghz emission towards the complex formed by g045.74@xmath3700.26 and g045.89@xmath3700.36 , in the field containing a46 , a47 , and a50 . despite the ` disturbed ' environments observed in the mir , the evolutionary stage of the three main clumps in this complex appear to range from quite evolved ( with extended and bright rimmed regions and a prominent ir stellar population ) , to the earliest stages of massive star formation detected so far in this field ( a46 , prior to the onset of significant maser emission and uchiirs ) .",
    "the parameters derived from these seds are typical of active clumps and are indeed suggestive of massive star formation , although at a lower level to that observed in the previous two clouds .    the enhanced datasets that will be provided by _",
    "( hi - gal ) and scuba-2 at jcmt ( jcmt galactic plane survey ; @xcite ) will be crucial to fully characterize and complete the census of the clump population in this field , especially the fainter and the coldest structures .",
    "in addition , the higher resolution of these instruments will help to probe down to core scales and to investigate the dusty structures within the clumps , which appear to be channeling the stellar activity and shaping the ionized regions in the neighborhood of the embedded ob stellar clusters .",
