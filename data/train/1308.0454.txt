    "the tropical semiring @xmath3 is the set @xmath4 endowed with the two operations @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we are interested in the tropical equivalent of linear programming . in other words ,",
    "our goal is to give an algorithm for minimizing a tropical linear form @xmath7 over a tropical polyhedron .",
    "the latter is the set of solutions @xmath8 of finitely many inequalities of the form @xmath9 all the coefficients @xmath10 are elements of @xmath11 .",
    "an example is depicted in figure  [ fig : intro_example ] below .",
    "several avenues lead to this research .",
    "first , the classical simplex method belongs to the most relevant algorithms , both for its applicability as well as its theoretical implications .",
    "so it is natural to explore variants and derivations , including tropical ones . in the form that we are studying",
    "this leads to a class of minmax problems which are also interesting from a purely complexity - theoretic point of view .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that a tropical analog of the feasibility problem in linear optimization is polynomial - time equivalent to deciding which player has a winning strategy in a mean - payoff game .",
    "the latter decision problem is among the few problems in np as well as co - np , see zwick and paterson  @xcite , for which no polynomial - time algorithm is known .",
    "this game - theoretic perspective leads to a second approach to tropical linear programming .",
    "a third train of thought is more geometrical .",
    "viro suggested to investigate the tropical aspects of real algebraic geometry already in  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the main focus of tropical geometry so far concerns the tropicalization of algebraic varieties which are defined over the complex numbers ( or puiseux series with complex coefficients ) .",
    "more recently , however , the tropicalization of real semi - algebraic sets has been studied by alessandrini @xcite . in this vein",
    "our work seeks to contribute to understanding the tropicalizations of the most simple semi - algebraic sets : convex polyhedra .",
    "a related motivation arises from linear programming over ordered fields , the complexity of which is a well known open question  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  2 ) .",
    "ordered fields arise naturally when dealing with perturbations of classical linear programs  @xcite .",
    "tropical polyhedra or tropically convex sets have appeared in different guises in the works of several authors , including  @xcite ; the present work is specially motivated by the approach of develin and sturmfels  @xcite , in which tropical polyhedra are studied by combinatorial means , and by the further work of develin and yu  @xcite , who showed that tropical polyhedra are precisely the images by the valuation of ( convex ) polyhedra over the field of puiseux series .    this in mind , the most natural approach for tropical linear programming probably is to do linear programming over real puiseux series and to tropicalize , _",
    "i.e. _ ,  to devise a method which traces the valuation of the path followed by the simplex algorithm over real puiseux series .",
    "this is exactly what we do here .",
    "what makes our algorithm interesting is that the method itself does not manipulate puiseux series ( explicit lifts to real puiseux series are not needed ) .",
    "instead it directly processes the tropical input and `` stays tropical '' throughout the computations . in this way ,",
    "the arithmetical operations remain elementary .",

    "further , we assume that each point in the feasible region has finite coordinates only .",
    "any tropical linear program satisfying these properties will be called _ standard _ ; see assumptions [ ass : general_position ] , [ ass : finite_coordinates ] and  [ ass : dual_general_position ] below .",
    "we defer all ramifications which come from looking at degenerate input or infinite coefficients to a subsequent second paper .",
    "our main result is the following theorem .",
    "[ th - main ] consider a standard tropical linear program with @xmath2 variables and @xmath1 inequalities .",
    "then , the tropical simplex algorithm ( algorithm  [ alg : main ] ) terminates and returns an optimal solution for any tropical pivoting rule .",
    "every iteration ( pivoting and computing reduced costs ) can be done in time @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the algorithm traces the image by the valuation map of the path followed by the classical simplex algorithm applied to any lift of this program to the field of real puiseux series , with a compatible pivoting rule .",
    "in particular , under the assumptions of theorem  [ th - main ] , linear programs over puiseux series are implicitly solved by the tropical simplex algorithm . by definition ,",
    "a tropical pivoting rule selects a variable of tropically negative reduced cost .",
    "a classical pivoting rule is said to be compatible with the former tropical pivoting rule if they select the same variables .",
    "tropical pivot rules are the topic of section  [ sec : pivot ] .",
    "our tropical simplex algorithm relies on several tools of independent interest .",
    "for instance , corollary  [ coro : val_and_inter_commute_for_generic_matrices ] shows that , again under the general position assumption , the cells of an arrangement of hyperplanes over the field of real puiseux series are in one to one correspondence with the cells of the arrangement of the associated tropical hyperplanes .",
    "this leads to the notion of _ tropical basic points _ and _ tropical edges _ of a system of tropical affine inequalities . unlike the classical case",
    ", a tropical basic point may not be tropically extreme , see proposition  [ prop : extreme_basic ] and remark  [ rk : therearefewerextremepoints ] below .",
    "this stems from the lack of a good notion for a general `` face '' of a tropical polyhedron ; see the discussions in @xcite this is related to competing notions of rank  @xcite .",
    "compute the tropical reduced costs @xmath16 associated with @xmath17 @xmath18    a fundamental discrepancy to the classical simplex algorithm is that a tropical edge in @xmath19 may have a more complex geometrical structure as , indeed , it consists of up to @xmath2 ordinary segments . these segments can be determined from _ tangent digraphs _ , which encode a local description of a tropical polyhedron ; tangent digraphs were initially introduced in the form of directed hypergraphs in  @xcite .",
    "the cornerstone of the tropical simplex algorithm is a new combinatorial characterization of the tangent digraph ( proposition  [ prop : tangent_graph_interior_edge ] ) at a point inside a tropical edge . in particular",
    ", this entails an incremental computation of tangent digraphs from one ordinary segment to another ( proposition  [ prop : tangent_graph_update ] ) , leading to an @xmath20 time method for one full pivoting step , see theorem  [ th : pivot ] .",
    "finally , we define the tropical reduced cost vector , which allows one to certify the optimality of a given basic point .",
    "we show that the vector of reduced costs can be computed by solving a system of signed tropical linear equations , and that the running time of this step is also bounded by @xmath0 , see theorem  [ thm : reduced_costs ] .",
    "let us finally point out some related work .",
    "the study of the analogs of linear programs over ordered semirings was undertaken in the book  @xcite , in particular , a duality theorem for a special class of linear programs can be found there .",
    "the idea of looking for analogs of convex programming results over `` extremal '' ( a variant of tropical ) structures is also apparent in  @xcite .",
    "several recent works have proposed algorithms to solve various tropical programming problems . in  @xcite ,",
    "a dichotomy algorithm is developed , allowing one to solve tropical linear programming problems by a reduction to linear feasibility problems . in  @xcite ,",
    "more general linear - fractional programming problems are studied , in which one maximizes the difference of two tropical linear forms . a policy iteration algorithm based on a parametric mean payoff game",
    "is given there .",
    "these policies seem to have interesting connections with basic points .",
    "however , our present approach leads to a fundamentally different method : we move along edges in the graph of the tropical polytope , whereas policy iteration type algorithms often take `` great leaps '' in the same graph ; also , one iteration of the present algorithm takes only @xmath0 time whereas every iteration in  @xcite requires to solve a mean payoff game .",
    "yet another different class of algorithms for solving tropical linear feasibility problems relies on cyclic projection  @xcite .",
    "recall also that the tropical linear feasibility problem is equivalent to mean payoff games , for which a number of algorithms are available , like pumping  @xcite , value iteration  @xcite , or policy iteration  @xcite .",
    "a reduction of mean payoff games to classical linear programs with exponentially large coefficients is established in  @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic simplex method developed in  @xcite solves arbitrary linear programs on laurent series ( which is sufficient for tropical linear programs with rational coefficients ) .",
    "each iteration of their method requires @xmath21 operations , where @xmath22 is the maximum taken over the valuations of all puiseux series arising during the computation .",
    "our tropical simplex algorithm shows a better complexity per iteration since the factor of @xmath23 is dispensed with , but the approach of @xcite does not require any genericity assumptions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec - prelim ] describes our notations and collects the relevant known facts about convex polyhedra over real puiseux series . for the reader",
    "s convenience we introduce a running example which we refer to throughout this paper . in section  [ sec : tropical_basic_points ] we characterize the key players in our algorithms : tropical basic points and tropical edges .",
    "the core of our paper is section  [ sec : pivot ] , where we describe the tropical pivot .",
    "section  [ sec : reduced_costs ] discusses tropical reduced costs .",
    "finally , theorem  [ th - main ] is proved in section  [ sec : generalization ] .",
    "our algorithm for solving tropical linear programs is outlined in algorithm  [ alg : main ] .",
    "it directly corresponds to phase  ii of the classical simplex method over real puiseux series .",
    "phase  ii starts from a given tropical basic point and proceeds along improving edges towards an optimal tropical basic point .",
    "the phase  i problem , to find a first tropical basic point will be addressed in a sequel to this work .",
    "while classically phase i can be reduced to phase ii , in general , this requires to solve a degenerate linear program .",
    "as explained above , this is out of the scope of the present paper .",

    "symmetrized tropical semiring_. indeed , the sum of two signed tropical numbers with opposite signs but identical modulus can not be defined as a signed tropical number , one needs to enlarge @xmath48 with a third type of elements , called _ balanced elements _ , to represent such sums .",
    "we will defer the discussion of the symmetrized tropical semiring until section  [ sec : symmetrized ] , since the additional technicalities can be spared in the first three quarters of this paper .",

    "we claim that under our assumptions , the edges of the puiseux polyhedron have a positive length ( _ i.e. _ ,  as a set , they are not reduced to a point ) . by contradiction , suppose that an edge @xmath1211 between the basic points @xmath1212 and @xmath1213 have zero length , where @xmath1214 and @xmath1215 . then @xmath1216 .",
    "thus the tropical basic point @xmath1217 is contained in the @xmath225 tropical s - hyperplanes @xmath1218 for @xmath1219 .",
    "since @xmath135 has finite entries by assumption [ ass : finite_coordinates ] , the @xmath225 elements of @xmath1220 appears as hyperplane nodes in the tangent graph at @xmath135 .",
    "this contradicts proposition  [ prop : tangent_graph_interior_edge ] and proves the claim .",
    "the basic points @xmath1212 and @xmath1213 of an edge @xmath1211 are related by @xmath1221 , where @xmath1222 is the length of @xmath1211 and @xmath275 its direction defined in  . when pivoting from @xmath1212 to @xmath1213 , the objective value increases by @xmath1223 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath280 is the reduced cost of the pivot along @xmath1211 from the basic point @xmath1224 . as a consequence , as long as a pivot with a negative reduced cost is chosen , each iteration improves the objective function over puiseux series . by assumption  [ ass : finite_coordinates ] , the puiseux polyhedron is bounded , thus the value of the puiseux linear program is finite",
    ". therefore , algorithm  [ alg : main ] does terminate .    finally , the output of algorithm  [ alg : main ] is a tropical basic point with tropically non - negative reduced costs . by proposition  [ prop - pivotingimprove ] ,",
    "the corresponding puiseux basic point is an optimum of the puiseux linear program . then by proposition  [ prop : puiseux_solves_tropical_program ] ,",
    "the tropical basic point is an optimum of the tropical linear program .",
    "we described tropical linear programming in the max - plus version of the tropical semiring .",
    "however , the proofs of our results also hold in any semiring @xmath1225 which arises from an abelian totally ordered group @xmath1226 _ i.e. _ ,  the semiring is defined on the set @xmath1227 , the order on @xmath1228 is extended to @xmath1229 by setting @xmath1230 for any @xmath1231 , and the maximum is defined with respect to the order on @xmath1228 . in this setting , the notion of `` tropical general position '' still makes sense .",
    "puiseux series are then replaced by the ordered field @xmath1232\\!]$ ] of ( formal ) hahn series with real coefficients and with value group @xmath1233 ; recall that hahn series are required to have a well ordered support .",
    "the analysis of section  [ sec : tropical_basic_points ] relies only on the fact that the coefficients of the series are real numbers ( theorem  [ thm : val_and_inter_commute_for_generic_matrices ] ) . in section",
    "[ sec : pivot ] the description of a tropical edge as the concatenation of ordinary segments still holds . finally in section  [ sec : reduced_costs ] , the tropical cramer theorem ( theorem  [ thm : tropical_cramer ] ) is still valid in this generalized setting .    the assertions of theorem  [ th - main ] remain valid if the tropical semiring is replaced by @xmath1229 and if the field of real puiseux series is replaced by the field of real hahn series @xmath1232\\!]$ ] , the execution time being now evaluated in a model in which every arithmetic operation in the group @xmath1228 takes a time @xmath973 .",
    "we end this paper by mentioning some simple extensions of the present results .",
    "our version of the tropical simplex algorithm can readily be adapted to the maximization of a tropical linear form over a tropical polyhedron , instead of the minimization .",
    "indeed , the former problem can be handled by taking as a cost vector a vector of negative tropical numbers , and lifting it to a cost vector of real puiseux series with negative leading coefficients .",
    "more generally , one may consider a tropical cost vector with both negative and positive coordinates .",
    "the present tropical simplex algorithm can still be defined in this setting , however , its interpretation in terms of tropical optimization problem turns out to be less satisfactory .",
    "indeed , the cost function @xmath1234 may be a balanced tropical number for some feasible vectors @xmath135 , whereas there is no total order on the symmetrized tropical semiring with a natural interpretation in terms of lift to real puiseux series .",
    "hence , the tropical minimization problem appears to be somehow ill defined .",
    "however , for an input in general position , the cost function evaluated at any tropical basic point will always be unbalanced .",
    "then , the tropical simplex algorithm , with some straightforward modifications , can be used to return a tropical basic point whose cost is minimal among all tropical basic points , but which may be incomparable with respect to some non - basic feasible points .",
    "we did not study the overall complexity of the tropical simplex algorithm .",
    "but we expect , as in the classical case , an exponential behavior on some particular examples ( such as the klee - minty cubes @xcite ) .",
    "the results of this paper should allow the construction of more general tropical pivoting algorithms .",
    "in particular , the criss - cross method @xcite , which pivots between unfeasible basic points of the arrangement of s - hyperplanes , should also tropicalize .",
    "pivots can be handled with algorithm [ alg : pivot ] .",
    "the selection of pivots would involve the tropical signs of the basic point and of the reduced costs .    finally , we briefly comment on the complexity of deciding if the tropical linear program [ eq : trop_linear_prog_pb ] given by @xmath1235 , @xmath128 and @xmath206 satisfies our standard conditions .",
    "it is always safe to assume that the assumptions [ assumption_a ] and [ assumption_b ] are satisfied , for it takes at most @xmath1236 time to simplify the input if this is not the case ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  1 ) . verifying the finiteness condition [ ass : finite_coordinates ] requires to solve @xmath2 tropical linear feasibility problems to check for a non - trivial intersection with the boundary of the tropical projective space , which amounts to solving mean - payoff games @xcite .",
    "so it is unclear whether or not this can be done in polynomial time .",
    "checking for non - degeneracity takes exponential time in the classical case @xcite ; and hence this should also hold for the tropical analog , assumption  [ ass : general_position ] .",
