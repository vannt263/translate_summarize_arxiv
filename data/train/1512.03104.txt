    "the astronomical observatory project for the national university of engineering ( oauni ,  @xcite ) began in 2009 .",
    "the initiative and strong support of the astronomy group ( ga ) at the faculty of sciences ( fc@xmath0uni ) was fundamental for this purpose .",
    "quickly the project gains additional support of the peruvian professional astronomers working in other countries , being the majority of them ex - members of ga .",
    "the main aim of this project is to implement a facility to perform astronomical observations for the fc - uni .",
    "this will let that scientific projects and graduate theses can be developed in observational astronomy .",
    "following this line , oauni will give support to the courses in astronomy actually being imparted at fc - uni . between the scientific programs priority",

    "the uni rectorate gave support for the acquisition of the optical tube for the scope .",
    "the importation of this equipment was completed at the end of 2011 .",
    "new financial sources were explored and in 2013 the project obtained a research grant from _ the world academy of sciences _ (",
    "this budget let us to acquire the robotic mount and a new ccd detector in 2014 .",
    "additional custom expenses were assumed by the uni rectorate and fc@xmath0uni .",
    "finally , a grant for a master student with a thesis associated to oauni project also was approved by twas .    up to now , the main instruments of oauni are a 0.5 m optical tube of extreme quality , a precision robotic mount , a couple of ccd detectors , a spectrograph , and an astronomical filters set with its own automatic filter wheel . on the first semester of 2014",
    ", we completed the pre - comiisioning phase that included the engage of the optical tube over the robotic mount .",
    "these indoor tests were inside the fc@xmath0uni building .    a collaboration between the astronomy area of the geophysical institute of peru ( igp ) and fc@xmath0uni let the installation of oauni inside the huancayo s igp site at the peruvian central andes ( see figure  [ mapa ] ) .",

    "we can show that a photometric precision of 0.1 mag is possible for weak objects of 15 mag , using short integration times ( it = 5 s ) .",
    "this time was the same it used on the first light . obviously weaker objects could be observed with this precision if proper and longer it are used .    as we noted above , the first light image recorded well sampled objects up to 12 magnitude .",
