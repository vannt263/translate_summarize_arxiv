    "[ 1h.2invthete1.invtheta2.invsum ] we show @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 as a function of the hurst exponent @xmath72 .",
    "it is interesting to note that as @xmath73 , then @xmath74 while @xmath70 remains finite , i.e. , for the fractal dimension @xmath75 the stiffness is entirely determined by the short - wavelength roughness in the macroasperity contact region .",
    "note also that since @xmath76 , where @xmath6 is the linear size of the system , the stiffness scales as @xmath77 with the size of the system .",
    "this is in contrast to the region where the @xmath78 relation holds where the interfacial contact stiffness is independent of the size @xmath6 of the system .",
    "note also that the stiffness scales with the rms roughness as @xmath79 while in the region where the @xmath78 relation holds the stiffness is proportional to @xmath80 . for the hurst exponent @xmath81 , which is typical in practical applications , @xmath82 , which appears to be in good agreement with the prefactor found by pohrt and popov in their numerical simulation study  @xcite .",
    "the treatment presented above can be generalized to obtain the distribution of stiffness values ( at least approximately ) by calculating the distribution @xmath83 of summit curvature radius @xmath17 ( which is easy to do ) .",
    "it is interesting to determine the critical force @xmath84 such that for @xmath85 one needs to use the finite size region expression for the stiffness while for @xmath86 the persson expression is valid .",
    "when the relation @xmath87 is valid the stiffness @xmath88 the critical force @xmath84 is determined by the condition that @xmath89 given by ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) coincide .",
    "this gives @xmath90 or @xmath91 note that typically ( for @xmath81 ) @xmath92 .",
    "the prediction ( 3 ) for the switching between the finite size region and the region where the stiffness is proportional to the loading force is in good agreement with our simulation results . to show this",
    "let us first write @xmath93 the surfaces we have studied in numerical simulations have the rms slope 0.1 . to relate this to @xmath94 which enters in ( 4 ) we use that @xmath95 or @xmath96 in the present case the rms slope is 0.1 and @xmath97 and @xmath98 so that @xmath99 for @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for @xmath102 . using this from ( 4 )",
    "we get @xmath103 for @xmath104 and @xmath105 for @xmath102 , which is in good agreement with fig . 1 in our paper .",
    "for the surface with @xmath106 from ( 5 ) we obtain ( for a surface with the rms slope 0.1 ) @xmath94 nearly @xmath107 times smaller than for @xmath98 , which will shift the cross - over force @xmath84 , between the two stiffness regions , with a similar factor to lower values , again in good agreement with the numerical studies .",
    "the results presented above differ from the conclusion of pohrt and popov who state that the power relation observed for small applied forces is valid for all applied forces  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite pohrt et al state : `` it is the authors strong belief that the proportionality found by persson appears only in the first case described .",
    "whenever the surfaces are truly fractal with no cut - off wavelength , a power law applies . ''",
    "the present study shows that this statement is incorrect and fig .",
    "1 in our letter clearly shows that the contact stiffness can not be described by a power law for all applied forces as this would correspond to a straight line on our log - log scale .    as an example consider applications to syringes , where the relation between the squeezing pressure @xmath108 and the ( average ) interfacial separation @xmath109 ( which determine the contact stiffness ) is very important for the fluid leakage at the rubber - stopper barrel interface .",
    "consider the contact region between a rib of the rubber stopper and the barrel .",
    "the width of the contact region ( of order @xmath110 ) defines the cut off wavevector @xmath111 .",
    "the hurst exponent @xmath112 and the rms roughness amplitude ( including the roughness components with wavevector @xmath113 ) is @xmath114 .",
    "the elastic modulus of the rubber stopper is typically @xmath115 . using these parameters we get from ( 4 ) : @xmath116 , which is negligible compared to the pressure in the contact region between the rib of the rubber stopper and the barrel , which is typically of order @xmath117 .",
    "the relation ( 1 ) as well as the above mentioned finite - size effect region has also been observed in experiments . in these experiments a rectangular block of silicon rubber ( a nearly perfect elastic material even at large strain )",
    "is squeezed against hard , randomly rough surfaces . in this case",
    "no plastic deformation will occur , and the compression of the rectangular rubber block , @xmath118 ( see below ) , which will contribute to the displacement @xmath119 of the upper surface of the block , can be accurately taken into account .",
    "such measurements were performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and were found to be in good agreement with the theory ( these tests involved no fitting parameters as the surface roughness power spectrum , and the elastic properties of the rubber block , were obtained in separate experiments ) . here we show the result for the contact stiffness @xmath120 ( not presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) of one additional such measurement .",
    "the experiment was performed for a silicon rubber block ( cylinder shape with diameter @xmath121 and height @xmath122 ) squeezed against a road asphalt surface with the rms roughness amplitude @xmath123 and the roll - off wavelength @xmath124 as inferred from the surface roughness power spectrum .",
    "the squeeze - force is applied via a flat steel plate and no - slip of the rubber could be observed against the steel surface or the asphalt surface .",
    "we measured the displacement @xmath119 of the upper surface of the block as a function of the applied normal load .",
    "note that @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the effective young s modulus taking into account the no - slip boundary condition on the upper and lower surface , which was measured to be @xmath127 in a separate experiment where the rubber block was squeezed between two flat steel surfaces . using ( 6 ) gives @xmath128 or @xmath129 where @xmath130 . using ( 7 ) in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] shows the normal contact stiffness as a function of the applied nominal contact pressure obtained from the measured @xmath131 relation with @xmath127 ( measured value ) and @xmath132 ( to indicate the sensitivity of the result to @xmath126 ) .",

    "@xcite without proof ) and the result is insensitive to @xmath126 as also seen in fig .",
    "[ experiment ] . for large contact pressure the experimental data exhibits rather large noise ( and great sensitivity to @xmath126 ) , which originates from the increasing importance of the compression of the rubber block for large contact pressure .",
    "that is , for large pressures the denominator in ( 7 ) almost vanishes , which implies that a small uncertainty in the measured @xmath131 relation ( which determines @xmath136 ) , or in @xmath126 , will result in a large uncertainty in @xmath137 for large pressures .",

    "[ experiment ] is the theory prediction which is obtained without any fitting parameter using the measured surface roughness power spectrum . for small contact pressure",
