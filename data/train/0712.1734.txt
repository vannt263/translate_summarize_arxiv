    "light hadron spectroscopy at low energies lies beyond the realm of perturbative qcd , although lattice qcd provides , in principle , a rigorous way to extract non  perturbative quantities from qcd .",
    "however , current lattice results are typically still done for relatively high quark masses .",
    "thus , in order to make contact with experiment , appropriate extrapolation formulas need to be derived .",
    "this is typically done by using chiral perturbation theory ( chpt)@xcite , which provides a model independent description of the dynamics of the lightest mesons , namely , the pions , kaons and etas , which are identified with the goldstone bosons ( gb ) associated to the qcd spontaneous chiral symmetry .",
    "hence , chpt is built out of only those fields , as a low energy expansion of a lagrangian whose terms respect all qcd symmetries , and in particular its symmetry breaking pattern .",
    "actually , this chiral expansion becomes a series in momenta and meson masses , generically @xmath3 , when taking into account systematically the small quark masses of the three lightest flavors that can be treated perturbatively .",
    "the chiral expansion scale is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the pion decay constant .",
    "chpt is renormalized order by order by absorbing loop divergences in the renormalization of parameters of higher order counterterms , known as low energy constants ( lec ) .",
    "their values depend on the specific qcd dynamics , and have to be determined either from experiment or from lattice qcd  they can not be calculated from perturbative qcd .",
    "the relevant remark for us is that , thanks to the fact that chpt has the same symmetries than qcd and that it couples to different kind of currents in the same way , the orthodox chpt expansion provides a _ systematic and model independent _ description of how the observables depend on some qcd parameters .",
    "this is the case for the leading dependence on the number of colors @xmath6 and , more important for our purposes here , the dependence on the quark masses , which can be implemented systematically up to the desired order in the orthodox chpt expansion .    in this work we focus on the two lightest resonances of qcd , the @xmath7 and the @xmath1 .",
    "it is therefore enough to work with the two lightest quark flavors @xmath8 in the isospin limit of an equal mass that we take as @xmath9 .",
    "the pion mass is given by an expansion @xmath10 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "therefore , studying the quark mass dependence is equivalent to study the pion mass dependence . in @xmath11 scattering at nlo within su(2 ) chpt only four lecs @xmath12 appear .",
    "of course , when changing pion masses we have to take into account that amplitudes are customarily written @xcite in terms of the @xmath13 independent lecs @xmath14 @xcite and the physical pion decay constant @xmath15 that depend explicitly on the pion mass , @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 matrix unitarity implies , for physical values of @xmath18 , that elastic @xmath11 scattering partial waves @xmath19 of definite isospin @xmath20 and angular momenta @xmath21 should satisfy @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the cm momenta .",
    "thus @xmath24 , and interactions are said to become strong precisely when this unitarity bound is saturated .",
    "however , the chpt low energy expansion @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , can only satisfy unitarity perturbatively , i.e : @xmath27    the one - channel inverse amplitude method ( iam ) @xcite is a unitarization technique that can be derived within a `` naive '' , intuitive , approach by noting that eq.([unit ] ) , _ fixes the imaginary part of the inverse amplitude exactly_. if we then use chpt to write @xmath28 , we find @xmath29 however , the above derivation is just formal , since the chpt series can only be used at low energies . the correct derivation uses dispersion theory , and the fact that the chpt series of @xmath30 and @xmath31 beyond leading order have an analytic structure with a `` physical cut '' from threshold to @xmath32 and a `` left cut '' from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "this leads to the following dispersion relation @xcite for @xmath35 @xmath36 where `` lc '' stands for a similar integral over the left cut and we have three subtractions to ensure convergence .",
    "a similar dispersion relation can be written for the function @xmath37 , by simply replacing @xmath35 by @xmath38 and changing the name of the subtraction constants . since @xmath39 is real , the functions @xmath38 and @xmath40 have _ exactly _ opposite integrals over the physical cut .",
    "their subtractions constants are the value of these functions at @xmath34 where the chpt expansion is safe . and finally , they also have opposite left cut contributions up to nnlo chpt .",
    "such an approximation on the left cut is , of course , only justified for small @xmath41 , but due to the three subtractions this is precisely the region that dominates the left cut integrals .",
    "therefore , the iam derivation is exact for the integrals over the elastic region and uses chpt only where it is well justified .",
    "the iam is even more justified if used sufficiently far from the left cut , as it is usually done , due to the additional @xmath42 suppression .    in the scalar channels",
    "there are also contributions to the dispersion relation coming from poles in @xmath31 due to the so - called adler zeros located well below threshold .",
    "such contributions lead , formally , to @xmath43 corrections in the iam , and are customarily neglected , leading to the standard iam we have justified above .",
    "however , if not taken into account , the adler zeros do not appear in the correct place and also unphysical poles occur in the iam .",
    "still , the influence of these unphysical poles is very localized around those adler zeros and the standard iam can be used safely for energies sufficiently far from the adler zeros .",
    "nevertheless , in the next section we will show that resonance poles move into the subthreshold region for sufficiently large pion masses and it is thus relevant to include the pole contributions and use a slightly modified iam , whose results agree with those of the standard iam , except in the subthreshold region , where the modified version is more reliable . such modified iam has already been built and used in @xcite , by adding an _ ad hoc _",
    "@xmath43 piece to the @xmath44 expansion , within the `` naive derivation '' explained just before eq.([iam ] ) .",
    "a rigorous dispersive derivation is in preparation @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "there are no model dependences in the approach , but just approximations to a given order in chpt . remarkably , the simple formula of the elastic iam , eq.([iam ] ) , ( or the slightly modified one to work in the subthreshold region ) , while reproducing the chpt expansion at low energies , is also able to generate both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances with values of the lecs compatible with standard chpt @xcite .",
    "in other words , the iam generates the poles @xcite associated to these resonances in the second riemann sheet .",
    "the fact that resonances are _ not introduced by hand _ but generated from first principles and data , is relevant because the existence and nature of scalar resonances is the subject of a long - lasting intense debate .",
    "to be precise , the iam , when reexpanded , reproduces the orthodox chpt series up to the order to which the input amplitude was evaluated and , in particular the quark mass dependence agrees with that of chpt up to that order .",
    "a few of the higher order terms are produced correctly by the unitarization but not the complete series for a discussion of this issue for the scalar pion formfactor see ref.@xcite .",
    "however , the formalism just described still provides us with a fair estimate of the quark mass dependence of the resonance properties . in this case , we can study , without any a priory assumption , the dependence of the resonances positions on qcd parameters like the number of colors @xmath6 @xcite or their dependence on the quark masses up to a given order in chpt .",
    "as commented above , since , for the moment , we are only interested in resonances appearing in elastic @xmath11 scattering , we can unitarize @xmath45 chpt at one - loop . for the lecs we take @xmath46 , directly from @xcite , ( since the partial waves where the @xmath2 and @xmath47 appear are not very sensitive to these two constants ) , whereas we use @xmath48 obtained from an iam fit to data up to the resonance region .",
    "all lecs are evaluated at @xmath49 , and are in fairly good agreement with standard values .",
    "the highest value of @xmath16 we can use is limited since we do not want to spoil the chiral expansion and we want to have some elastic @xmath11 regime below the @xmath50 threshold .",
    "a mass of @xmath51 satisfies both criteria since we know su(3 ) chpt still works fairly well with a kaon mass that high , and also because if we increase the pion mass to 500 mev , the kaon mass becomes @xmath52 600 mev , and @xmath11 scattering is still elastic for 200 mev , before reaching the two - kaon threshold . to reach higher masses",
    "we would need a coupled - channel iam , which is feasible , but lies beyond our present scope .",
    "thus , in fig.[fig : f1 ] we show the @xmath53 and @xmath1 poles movement in the second riemman sheet as @xmath16 increases .",
    "note that in order to follow easily the pole movement relative to the two - pion threshold , which is also increasing , we express all quantities in units of @xmath54 , so that the two - pion threshold is shown fixed at @xmath55 . in this way",
    "we clearly see that both poles move closer to the two - pion threshold .",
    "let us recall that for narrow resonances , their mass @xmath56 and width @xmath57 are related to the pole position as @xmath58 and customarily this notation is also kept for broader resonances . hence , both the @xmath2 and @xmath47 widths decrease for increasing @xmath16 , partly due to phase space reduction .",
    "in particular , the @xmath47 pole moves toward the real axis and just when the threshold is reached it jumps into the real axis on the first sheet , thus becoming a traditional bound state , while its conjugate partner remains on the second sheet practically at the very same position as the one in the first .",
    "in contrast , when the @xmath2 mass reaches the two - pion threshold , its poles remain on the second sheet with a non - zero imaginary part before they meet on the real axis and become virtual states . as @xmath16 increases further , one of those virtual states moves towards the threshold and jumps onto the first sheet , whereas the other one remains in the second sheet .",
    "although , of course , this happens for very large values of @xmath16 , such an analytic structure , with two very asymmetric poles in different sheets of an angular momentum zero partial wave , is a signal for a prominent molecular component @xcite . differences between p - wave and s - wave pole movements were also found within quark models @xcite , the latter showing also two second sheet poles on on the real axis below threshold .    in fig.2 ( left ) we show in detail , the growth of the @xmath2 and @xmath47 masses , starting from the chiral limit up to @xmath59 500 mev .",
    "we find that both the @xmath47 and @xmath2 mass increase , but that of the @xmath2 grows faster , until it splits in two virtual states",
    ". then one mass keeps growing , whereas the other one decreases .",
    "finally in fig.2 ( right ) we show our central value result for the @xmath47 mass dependence on @xmath16 compared with some recent lattice results @xcite . despite our results refer to the @xmath47 `` pole - mass '' definition and that those results on the lattice have a zero width for the @xmath47 , we see a reasonable qualitative agreement between both results , although our dependence seems to be somewhat steeper .",
    "we have some preliminary indications that if we decrease the @xmath47 width in our approach ( by taking the large @xmath6 limit of chpt ) , we reproduce even better those lattice results .",
    "a publication with further details is in preparation @xcite including results of the @xmath1 and @xmath0 mass and width evolution with the pion mass as well as a comparison with other works and lattice results .",
    "estimates of uncertainties and possibly an extension to the su(3 ) coupled channel case are in progress .",
