    "instead we need surveys less biased against obscured agn .",
    "there are three reasons to suspect that most agn are obscured by large column densities of gas and dust .",
    "first , a large body of evidence suggests that local agn have geometries that are not spherically symmetric , and that different aspect angles present markedly different observed characteristics ; this is referred to as agn unification @xcite .",
    "second , agn are more common at high redshift ( @xmath1 ) , where the average star formation rate is higher and thus it is even more likely that gas and dust surround the galaxy nucleus than at @xmath2 .",
    "third , and most important , obscured agn are required to explain the shape of the x - ray  background \" radiation .",
    "the x - ray  background \" is actually the superposition of individual agn that were not resolved in early x - ray experiments ( hence the designation  background \" ) .",
    "as shown in figure  1a , its spectrum peaks at @xmath3  kev ( i.e. , this is where most of the energy is produced ) , much harder than the typical spectrum ( roughly flat in these units ) of an unobscured agn . in obscured agn , however , the softest x - ray photons have been absorbed via the photoelectric effect , and compton - thick agn ( those with @xmath4",
    "@xmath5 ) actually peak at roughly 30  kev ( fig .",
    "[ fig_xrbgspec]b ) .",

    ", nasa s three operating great observatories  the chandra x - ray observatory , the spitzer space telescope , and the hubble space telescope  enable matched x - ray , infrared , and optical surveys at unprecedented depth and resolution .",
    "the announcement in spring 2000 of the first spitzer legacy opportunity led to the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) , to date the deepest wide - area multiwavelength survey carried out with spitzer , hubble , and chandra @xcite . by targeting the spitzer legacy , and later the hubble treasury , observations on the pre - existing chandra deep fields , we leveraged substantial investments of observing time , probed agn demographics at the peak of quasar activity ( @xmath9 ) , and enabled a wide range of other science , described in the _ astrophysical journal letters _ special edition of january 10 , 2004 .",

    "three of the four regions had already been observed extensively , including the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdf - s ) and the extended hubble deep field south ( ehdf - s ) , thus leveraging substantial investments with chandra , xmm - newton , hst , and the largest ground - based telescopes .",

    "the question we set out to answer with goods , musyc , and cosmos was ,  is there a substantial population of obscured agn that is missed by traditional optical surveys ? \" to answer this question we need to sample the agn population at @xmath9 , at the peak of the number density .",
    "the goods survey , and the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) x - ray survey on which goods piggy - backed @xcite , were designed to sample the agn population at @xmath12 , which includes the agn that make up the x - ray background .",
    "luminous agn at higher redshifts could certainly be detected but the volume surveyed is too small to expect to see a reasonable number of them .",
    "early results in the cdfs and other deep x - ray fields showed there was a population of optically faint hard x - ray sources @xcite , which collectively comprised a large fraction of the integrated x - ray background intensity .",
    "however , as optical counterparts were identified and spectra obtained , several apparent problems emerged .",
    "first , the redshift distribution peaked at relatively low values , @xmath13 , lower than expected from the early population synthesis models for the x - ray background .",
    "second , the fraction of x - ray sources that were identified as obscured , either because of high @xmath14 or absence of broad lines , was less than the canonical 3/4 seen at low redshift , and appeared to decline with redshift rather than increase , as specified by the best population synthesis model at that time @xcite . a number of authors pointed out these problems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and @xcite suggested that  the unification scheme based on",
    "a simple orientation effect fails at high redshifts \" and that the production of the x - ray background by a collection of obscured agn  requires major revision . \"    at the same time , these faint red x - ray agn were copious emitters of infrared radiation @xcite , fully consistent with the unification paradigm .",
    "it also became apparent early on that , as for optically - selected quasars , the evolution of x - ray selected agn is luminosity dependent , with high - luminosity agn evolving earlier and more rapidly than low - luminosity agn @xcite ; this luminosity - dependent density evolution had not been incorporated in earlier population synthesis models for the x - ray background .",
    "finally , we suspected that selection effects could play a significant role in affecting the redshifts and optical identifications of survey sources .",
    "accordingly , we developed a comprehensive quantitative approach , based on the unification scenario and incorporating the most recent , best luminosity function and evolution , to predict the number counts and redshift distributions at any wavelength ( for the moment , infrared through x - ray , though it could be generalized ) for surveys of arbitrary area , depth , and wavelength .",
    "here we describe the quantitative interpretation of the multiwavelength data from goods , musyc , cosmos and other deep multiwavelength surveys , including the dependence of the obscured fraction of agn on luminosity and redshift .",
    "specifically , we show that most agn are obscured at all redshifts ; that the fraction of obscured agn decreases with luminosity ; and that it increases with redshift , at least out to redshift @xmath15 , an epoch of substantial black hole and galaxy growth .",
    "deep infrared and hard x - ray surveys over larger areas will be needed to reach higher redshifts and to probe fully the co - evolution of galaxies and black holes .",
    "our approach was to connect surveys at different wavelengths by assuming something sensible about agn spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , then combining those with well - measured luminosity functions and evolution to understand the source counts and redshift distributions of agn selected at a given flux limit at any wavelength ( @xcite ; analogous approaches have been taken by @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "simultaneously , we constrain the same agn population to fit the x - ray background @xcite . an alternative approach is to model only the x - ray spectra of agn and to fit the x - ray background alone with a mixture of obscured and unobscured agn @xcite ; this constrains the demographics but does not connect the x - ray sources to those detected at optical and infrared wavelengths  and thus does not use those additional constraints on the agn demographics , nor does it allow a quantitative estimate of the important effect of optical or infrared flux limits on the survey content or spectroscopic identifications .",
    "briefly , our procedure was as follows : we started with the underlying agn demographics , described by an agn luminosity function that incorporates dependence on absorbing column density , and the luminosity - dependent evolution of this function @xcite . because this luminosity function is based on hard x - ray observations , it is relatively free of bias against obscured agn .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    we then developed a set of seds , based on the unification paradigm , that represent agn with a wide range in intrinsic luminosity and absorbing column density ( parameterized in terms of the neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath14 , along the line of sight ) . specifically , at optical wavelengths ( @xmath18=0.1 - 1 microns ) , we used a sloan digital sky survey composite quasar spectrum @xcite plus milky - way - type reddening laws and a standard dust - to - gas ratio to convert @xmath14 to @xmath19 ; we also added an @xmath17 elliptical host galaxy , which is the dominant component for heavily obscured agn . in the x - ray ( @xmath200.5 kev ) , we assumed a power - law spectrum with photon index @xmath21 , typical of unobscured agn , absorbed by column densities in the range @xmath22 - 24  @xmath5 . to describe the infrared part of the seds ( @xmath231 micron ) , which in the unification paradigm includes radiation from dust heated by absorbed ultraviolet through soft x - ray photons , we used dust emission models by @xcite in a clumpy torus geometry ( fig .",

    "there is some freedom in the choice of torus geometry , of course ; we selected an aspect ratio that would produce three times as many agn with @xmath14 greater than @xmath24  @xmath5 compared to smaller column densities ( fig .",

    "first , obscured agn have smaller x - ray fluxes , so there is a bias against their detection in the x - ray sample in the first place .",
    "this is a small effect , particularly because it becomes relatively less important with increasing redshift ( for which rest - frame emission is in an increasingly harder x - ray band affected only by higher and higher column densities ) .",
    "second , obscured agn are fainter in the optical , so there is a bias against spectroscopic identifications for @xmath56 @xcite ; this is not important for samples with highly complete spectroscopic identifications .",
    "third and quite important , the obscured fraction depends strongly on luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ figlumratio ] ) .",
    "given the luminosity - redshift correlation inherent in flux - limited samples , the mean agn luminosity increases with redshift and therefore the obscured fraction that is observed decreases  even if the same population of obscured lower - luminosity agn is present .",
    "our analysis shows that this is the dominant selection effect .",
    "it is an important effect even in agn samples with 100% complete spectroscopic identifications , as indicated by the blue line in figure  [ ratioevol]a .",
    "simply put , high redshift agn samples are biased to higher luminosity , and thus contain lower obscured fractions , even if there is no underlying evolution of the ratio between obscured and unobscured agn at all .",
    "the observed more gradual decline in obscured fraction of agn actually implies an increase in obscured fraction with redshift .",
    "figure  [ ratioevol]b shows the data relative to ( i.e. , divided by ) the expectation for a non - evolving population , for the super - sample and the two sub - samples with higher identification fractions .",
    "the effect is largely independent of the completeness of the optical identifications .",
    "fitting the increasing fraction with a simple power - law dependence on redshift , @xmath57 , gives a good fit for @xmath58 .",
    "this means that the fraction of agn at redshift @xmath53 that are obscured is observed to be twice as high as would be the case were the intrinsic fraction constant .",
    "agn obscuration is substantially greater in the young universe .",
    "goods , musyc , and other deep multiwavelength surveys provide overwhelming evidence for a large population of obscured agn that dominate agn demographics out to high redshifts .",
    "optical surveys are biased against detecting these objects , and even hard x - ray surveys , which are considerably less biased , suffer strong selection effects , primarily due to the luminosity - dependence of obscuration .    taking these effects into account quantitatively , with a realistic , well - constrained population synthesis model that uses agn spectral energy distributions based on a unification paradigm",
    ", we deduce that the ratio of obscured ( @xmath25  @xmath5 ) to unobscured ( @xmath59  @xmath5 ) agn is roughly 3:1 locally ( integrated over all luminosities ) , and increases with redshift .",
    "low - luminosity agn ( @xmath60  ergs / s @xmath61  ergs / s ) are much more likely to be obscured than high - luminosity agn ( @xmath62  ergs / s ) .    to the extent that our assumed infrared through x - ray spectral energy distributions are reasonable , and our assumed @xmath14 distribution is reasonable ( it is essentially the same as that used by others in the field ; see @xcite for a comparison of the different distributions ) , these results are completely robust .",
    "how might one avoid the biases inherent in optical and x - ray surveys ? in principle",
    ", far - infrared surveys are unbiased because the absorbed energy is re - radiated thermally ; however , infrared surveys are very inefficient for agn selection since the infrared sky is strongly dominated by starlight ( fig .",
    "[ figirbg]a ) .",
    "in addition , agn signatures ( such as broad emission lines , strong power - law continua , and rapid variability ) may well be hidden in obscured objects .",
    "thus , identifying complete samples of agn from far - infrared surveys will never be a simple matter , although it can potentially put useful limits on the fraction of galaxies with buried agn .",
    "selection effects are very important to take into account for any survey , even those that are 100% identified .",
    "for example , consider a deep hard x - ray survey for which all sources have optical and/or infrared counterparts with known redshifts and classification .",
    "many would assume the survey itself is not strongly biased and that the identifications yield the underlying demographics , since no x - ray sources remain unidentified .",
    "however , missing from the x - ray sample are the most heavily obscured agn ; even more important , unobscured agn are over - represented ( relative to their fraction of the underlying population ) , especially at high redshift , because of the dependence of obscuration on luminosity .",
    "this in fact is the dominant effect for existing surveys .",
    "therefore , to understand the distribution of black holes in the universe and to estimate cosmic accretion rates , the selection effects must be modeled using reasonable assumptions about the underlying population . that in turns yields a picture of the universe that matches well our picture of nascent accreting black holes at the centers of dusty , star - forming , young galaxies in the early universe",
