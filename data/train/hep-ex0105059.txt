    "the individual results are combined to single values for @xmath2  and @xmath3 , respectively , following the procedure described in  @xcite .",
    "the combination is done separately for the results from event shape distributions or mean values .",
    "a weighted average of the individual results is calculated with the square of the reciprocal total errors used as the weights .",
    "for each of the systematic checks the weighted averages for @xmath2  and @xmath3  are also determined and the total error of the weighted average is calculated exactly as described in section  [ sec_syst ] .",
    "this procedure accounts for correlations of the systematic errors .",
    "we obtain as combined results from the analysis of distributions @xmath138 the error contributions refer to the fit error ( fit ) , the variations of the input data sets and the fit ranges ( syst . ) and the variations of the matching scheme , renormalisation scale , milan factor and @xmath109  ( theo . ) .",
    "the total correlation coefficient is estimated as @xmath139 ( see below ) . the small value for @xmath2  compared to the world average @xmath140  @xcite is caused by the small values of @xmath2  from @xmath17  or @xmath74  and in particular @xmath76 . if the results from @xmath76  are omitted from the weighted averages the results become @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",

    "the results from the study of mean values based on , , , and are @xmath143 the error contributions are defined as explained above for distributions . the estimate of the total correlation coefficient is @xmath144 .",
    "the values for @xmath2  and @xmath3  are in reasonable agreement with the results from distributions , especially when the average of results from distributions is calculated without the values from @xmath76 .",
    "figures  [ fig - a0_results ] a ) and b ) present the results for @xmath2and @xmath3  with error ellipses based on the total errors .",
    "the correlation coefficients are determined as follows . for every systematic test",
    "a covariance matrix is constructed using the systematic uncertainties , symmetrised if neccessary , and a correlation coefficient @xmath145 . in cases",
    "where the correlation between systematic deviations of @xmath2  and @xmath3  of a given systematic test has the same sign as the correlation @xmath146  from the fit result we set @xmath147 . in cases where the signs from the correlations from the standard fit and the systematic test are opposite we set @xmath148 or @xmath149 taking the sign from the correlation of the systematic test .",
    "all covariance matrices are added and the result defines the error ellipsis .",
    "tables  [ tab_chisum ] and  [ tab_mean_as ] show the correlation coefficients obtained with this procedure .",
    "the correlation coefficients of the averages are calculated as the weighted averages of the individual correlation cofficients using the products of the individual total errors for @xmath2  and @xmath3  as weights .",
    "the figure illustrates that the individual results for @xmath2  and @xmath3  from distributions and mean values are compatible with each other and with the averages within the total errors .",
    "we consider this as a confirmation of the predicted universality of the non - perturbative parameter @xmath5 .",
    "finally we combine the results for @xmath2  from the analysis of distributions , mean values of @xmath13 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76  and @xmath27  and from by calculating error weighted averages based on the symmetrised total errors . as errors of the final combined results the smaller of the errors of the individual results",
    "are chosen .",
    "the final result for @xmath2  is @xmath150 the final result for @xmath3  is obtained by combining the results from distributions and mean values again quoting the smaller of the total errors of the individual results as the final errors : @xmath151 the total correlation coefficient is again estimated as a weighted average of the correlation coefficients from the combined results from distributions and mean values , respectively , yielding @xmath152 .",
    "the analytic treatment of non - perturbative effects to event shape observables in @xmath0  annihilation based on power corrections was examined .",
    "we tested predictions for the differential distributions and mean values of the observables @xmath13 , @xmath17  or @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath27  and @xmath39 , respectively . for this test a large amount of event shape data collected by several experiments over a range of @xmath0  annihilation energies from @xmath1 to 189  gev was considered .",
    "fits of perturbative qcd predictions combined with power corrections to distributions and mean values of event shape observables were performed with the strong coupling @xmath2  and the non - perturbative parameter @xmath114  as free parameters .",
    "the good quality of the fits with @xmath153 supports the predicted @xmath129 evolution of the power corrections .",
    "the results for @xmath2  and @xmath3  from distributions are more consistent with each other compared to previous studies  @xcite due to the improved predictions of power corrections to the jet broadening variables .",
    "however , we still observe a large deviation of the @xmath2  results obtained from @xmath76from those extracted from the other observables .",
    "we conjecture that this discrepancy is a combined effect of the perturbative @xmath6+nlla predictions and the power correction calculations for this observable .",
    "the individual results for @xmath2  from all observables are observed to be systematically smaller than the corresponding results in  @xcite , which use monte carlo hadronisation models .",
    "this observation may be related to the different amounts of squeeze of the distributions predicted by both types of hadronisation model .",
    "we obtain as combined results for the strong coupling constant and the non - perturbative parameter : @xmath154 it should be noted that the values for @xmath2  and @xmath3  from @xmath76are only compatible with the combined result and with the values of @xmath2  from the other observables within about two standard deviations of the total errors .",
    "the average value for @xmath3  is in good agreement with previous results  @xcite .",
    "the scatter of @xmath3  values derived from @xmath13 , @xmath75  and @xmath27  is covered by the expected theoretical uncertainty of the milan factor of about 20  @xcite .    since this value is representative of the individual results within the errors we consider this as a confirmation of the universality of @xmath5  as predicted by the dmw model .",
    "however , the results from @xmath17  or @xmath74  and @xmath76from distributions indicate that uncalculated higher orders may contribute significantly to the non - perturbative corrections .    10    t.  sjstrand : comput . phys . commun .",
