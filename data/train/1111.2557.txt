    "in addition , these resonances change the stability conclusion .",
    "in particular , the anti - phase oscillations may become unstable in soft nonlinear potentials even if the coupling constant is sufficiently small .",
    "another interesting feature of soft potentials is the symmetry - breaking ( pitchfork ) bifurcation of one - site and multi - site breathers that occur near the point of resonances . in symmetric potentials , the first non - trivial resonance occurs near @xmath27 , that is , at 1:3 resonance .",
    "we analyze this bifurcation by using asymptotic expansions and reduction of the discrete klein  gordon equation ( [ kglattice ] ) to a normal form , which coincides with the nonlinear duffing oscillator perturbed by a small harmonic forcing .",
    "it is interesting that the normal form equation for 1:3 resonance which we analyze here is different from the normal form equations considered in the previous studies of 1:3 resonance @xcite .",
    "the difference is explained by the fact that we are looking at bifurcations of periodic solutions far from the equilibrium points , whereas the standard normal form equations for 1:3 resonance are derived in a neighborhood of equilibrium points .",
