    "the formalism of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite can be applied to high - energy processes in which massless quarks are emitted with large energy . in this case a light quark with large energy has three different scales @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath10 is the large energy scale and @xmath13 is a small parameter . here",
    "@xmath14 is a typical transverse momentum scale .",
    "scet has been applied to many high - energy processes in which final - state particles include energetic light particles .",
    "for example , the hard contribution to the heavy - to - light form factor @xcite , the pion form factor and high - energy scattering @xcite , and radative leptonic @xmath0 decays @xmath15 @xcite have been studied .",
    "recently it has been applied to nonleptonic @xmath0 decays into two light mesons by the authors @xcite and nonleptonic decays are shown to factorize at leading order in scet and to all orders in @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we apply scet to rare radiative @xmath0 decays @xmath16 , where @xmath17 can be a @xmath18 meson or a @xmath19 meson . in this case , employing a two - step matching offers a convenient procedure to obtain the matrix elements of the relevant operators evaluated below the scale @xmath20 .",
    "first we consider an effective theory called @xmath7 , in which the degrees of freedom with @xmath21 are integrated out and the effective theory describes physics below the scale @xmath22 and above @xmath23 . in @xmath7 , we can construct all the effective operators which are gauge invariant under collinear and ultrasoft ( usoft ) gauge transformations .",
    "but a typical scale in @xmath7 is of order @xmath24 , which is still too big for the evaluation of the matrix elements of the effective operators .",
    "a next step is to go down to the second effective theory @xmath9 , in which all the degrees of freedom with @xmath25 are integrated out and a typical scale in @xmath9 is of order @xmath26 and the small parameter becomes of order @xmath4 . in @xmath9 , we can evaluate the matrix elements of the operators between meson states .",
    "the two - step matching looks complicated , but the construction and the power counting of operators become manifest .",
    "radiative @xmath0 decays have been previously considered in different theoretical frameworks .",
    "ali and parkhomenko @xcite calculated hard spectator contributions to radiative @xmath0 decays in the scheme of the large energy effective theory , and presented their results at next - to - leading order and to leading order in @xmath4 . in this approach",
    "they calculated the decay amplitudes in the full theory , and expanded them in powers of @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",
    "radiative @xmath0 decays were also considered in the context of the heavy quark mass limit @xcite , in which the amplitudes in the full theory are expanded in powers of @xmath29 @xcite , employing the light - cone wave functions of the mesons convoluted with the hard scattering amplitudes .",
    "the results in refs .",
    "@xcite show that the radiative @xmath0 decay amplitudes are factorized at next - to - leading order in @xmath3 and to leading order in @xmath4 .",
    "subleading effects in radiative @xmath0 decays such as the study of the topology of the weak annihilation and the @xmath8-exchanges channels @xcite , and the isospin breaking effects @xcite were studied .",
    "if we apply scet to radiative @xmath0 decays , we can extend the proof of the factorization theorem to all orders in @xmath3 at leading order in @xmath4 .",
    "it is possible because we require that the effective operators in @xmath9 be gauge invariant under collinear and soft gauge transformations .",
    "the gauge invariance and the reparameterization invariance put a serious constraint on the possible forms of the effective operators in scet @xcite .",
    "the gauge invariance is achieved by introducing the corresponding wilson lines , and these wilson lines include the effects of collinear and soft gluons to all orders in @xmath3 .",
    "the wilson coefficients of the effective operators can be calculated to desired accuracy , say , next - to - leading order , or next - to - next - to - leading order , but the form of the effective operators remains the same .",
    "another advantage in applying scet is that we can make the power counting explicit at each step of the effective theories @xmath7 and @xmath9 . in @xmath7",
    ", we can obtain gauge invariant operators in powers of @xmath6 .",
    "when we integrate out an intermediate scale , we need not worry about operator mixing in different powers of @xmath6 since the matching is perturbative .",
    "as we go down to @xmath9 , the small parameter now becomes @xmath30 and the power counting is explicit .",
    "to summarize , our procedure to employ scet is first to match qcd onto @xmath7 at @xmath31 , and factorize the usoft - collinear interactions with the field redefintions .",
    "finally we match @xmath7 onto @xmath9 at @xmath32 , and evaluate the matrix elements .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we briefly review the basic ingredients of scet in studying radiative @xmath0 decays .",
    "we explain which types of operators are needed in computing the decay amplitudes of radiative @xmath0 decays , and the outline of the procedure in using scet is sketched . in section iii ,",
    "all the relevant operators are derived in @xmath7 .",
    "there are effective operators without spectator quarks , and if we include the effects of spectator quarks , new four - quark operators and four - quark operators with a photon are induced .",
    "these operators are constructed in a gauge invariant way . in section iv ,",
    "the operators obtained in @xmath7 are evolved down to @xmath9 , and we evaluate all the matrix elements of the operators at leading order in scet . in section",
    "v , all the contributions are combined to produce the decay amplitudes for the radiative @xmath0 decays . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize all the effects of various operators and a conclusion is presented .",
    "in order to describe radiative @xmath0 decays in scet , the first step is to construct effective operators in @xmath7 by integrating out the degrees of freedom of order @xmath22 from the full theory .",
    "the effective operators should be gauge invariant under collinear and usoft gauge transformations , and these operators can be systematically expanded in a power series of the small parameter @xmath6 , of order @xmath34 .",
    "after we construct all the operators contributing to radiative @xmath0 decays in @xmath7 , we evolve these operators down to @xmath9 . in obtaining @xmath9 , we integrate all the off - shell modes of order @xmath35 , and all the operators in @xmath9 can be expanded in a power seris of the small parameter , which now becomes of order @xmath4 . at each step of the effective theories , we match theories at the boundary requiring that matrix elements of a given operator be the same in both theories .",
    "and we go down to the scale of interest by using the renormalization group equation .",
    "we begin with the effective hamiltonian for @xmath0 decays in the full qcd , which is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 here @xmath38 is an up - type quark @xmath39 or @xmath40 quark , and @xmath41 is a down - type quark @xmath41 ( for @xmath42 ) or @xmath43 ( for @xmath44 ) quark .",
    "the indices @xmath45 , @xmath46 are color indices , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the electomagnetic and the chromomagnetic field strength tensors respectively , and @xmath49 are the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements .",
    "the sign convention for @xmath50 corresponds to negative @xmath51 and the covariant derivative is defined as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) is the gluon ( photon ) field .",
    "the leading contribution to @xmath33 comes from the operator @xmath55 in the full theory . in the effective theory ,",
    "the leading - contribution comes from the leading - order operator derived from @xmath55 . in the following computation",
    ", we will neglect the radiative corrections of the penguin operators since their coefficients are proportional to @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) , which are numerically small compared to @xmath58 .",
    "but we include the loop correction from @xmath59 since @xmath60 is not negligible compared to @xmath58 .",
    "when the penguin operators appear at leading order in @xmath3 , we include their effects .",
    "before we consider the effective operators for radiative @xmath0 decays in @xmath7 , let us introduce the notations we use in this paper and discuss the power counting of operators .",
    "we choose the direction of the vector meson as @xmath61 , and the direction of the photon as @xmath62 . and",
    "the vector mesons are regarded as massless at leading order in scet .",
    "therefore the @xmath63 breaking effects in @xmath64 and @xmath65 and the @xmath66 isospin breaking effects in @xmath67 and @xmath68 arise at subleading order . the quark mass effect in scet",
    "was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can cause leading operators in @xmath9 .",
    "however the matrix elements of these operators in radiative @xmath0 decays at leading order in scet turn out to vanish .",
    "this is discussed in appendix in detail .",
    "we denote the collinear fields @xmath69 and @xmath70 as the collinear fields in the @xmath61 and the @xmath62 directions respectively , satisfying @xmath71 the collinear gluon field @xmath72 in the @xmath61 direction can be decomposed as @xmath73 and the power counting of the operators involving collinear fields can be made explicit as shown in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the photon field @xmath54 can not be decomposed as the collinear gluon to facilitate the power counting .",
    "the decomposition of the collinear gluon field in eq .",
    "( [ cgluon ] ) is meaningful since quarks and gluons have small fluctuations due to strong interaction .",
    "if we consider an external photon , the photon field does not have such small fluctuations and the momentum of the photon is always of order @xmath74 , and only the transverse part contributes to decay amplitudes .",
    "therefore we do not include the photon field in the power counting of operators .",
    "though we assign any power of @xmath6 to the photon field , it does not affect the relative power counting of various operators since all the operators for @xmath16 will include a single photon .",
    "there are two kinds of effective operators in @xmath7 from different channels , which can be classified into the operators without spectator quarks and those with spectator quarks .",
    "the leading operator for the first type of operators comes from @xmath55 by replacing the quarks in the full theory by those in the effective theory and making the resultant operator gauge invariant under collinear gauge transformations .",
    "we also have the contributions from the operators @xmath59 and @xmath75 by radiative corrections , whose matrix elements are proportional to the matrix element of @xmath55 .",
    "the resultant operators are heavy - light quark bilinear operators with a photon field .",
    "these operators , after we make them gauge invariant by attaching wilson lines , can produce operators with an additional external gluon . at order @xmath76",
    ", these operators can be obtained by attaching a collinear gluon to @xmath55 , or a photon to @xmath75 , or a gluon and a photon to @xmath59 .",
    "all these operators without spectator quarks can be obtained by attaching a photon or a gluon to fermion lines in the operators @xmath55 , @xmath59 and @xmath75 .",
    "when we attach a photon or a gluon to each operator , if any intermediate states have momenta of order @xmath74 , we integrate out these modes to obtain effective operators .",
    "if the intermediate states have momenta of order @xmath77 , then these modes can not be integrated out in @xmath7 . instead",
    "that channel should be considered in @xmath9 . in order to make the operators gauge invariant under collinear gauge transformations",

    "we compute all the operators in @xmath7 to order @xmath6 in order to obtain the leading - order result due to the possible enhancement in evolving the operators to @xmath9 .",
    "the second type of the operators is the operators with spectator quarks .",
    "these include the four - quark operators of the generic form @xmath78 , and @xmath79 .",
    "as mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can use the fierz transformation to make the operator @xmath80 of the form @xmath81 , and we will consider the four - quark operators only in the form @xmath82 from now on .",

    "we can apply scet to the radiative @xmath0 decays such as @xmath65 or @xmath64 , and the organization of the relevant operators can be systematically achieved using the power counting in scet . employing the two - step matching from @xmath7 to @xmath9 , off - shell modes are integrated out successively and we can obtain gauge invariant operators under collinear and soft gauge transformations in powers of @xmath6 .",
    "the scaling of @xmath6 changes from @xmath34 in @xmath7 to @xmath4 in @xmath9 , and the power counting of the operators can be achieved including the time - ordered products of the operators with the lagrangian .",

    "recent discussion @xcite on the field redefinitions to make the gauge invariance explicit to all orders , and the effects of the quark masses would help construct the operators .",
    "we are grateful to zoltan ligeti for pointing out that the quark mass effect on radiative @xmath0 decays can be of leading order in @xmath9 .",
    "we add an appendix commenting on the quark mass effects to complete the analysis .",
