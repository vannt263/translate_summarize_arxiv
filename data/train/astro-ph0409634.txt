    "using emmi on eso s ntt , we obtained phase - resolved echelle spectroscopy of ip peg in august 1999 , when the system was in outburst .",
    "our series of 39 spectra , each with an integration time of 300s , extends for more than 5.4 hours , i.e. 1.5 orbital period .",
    "the large wavelength coverage , approximately from 3900 to 7700 , provides us with several emission lines whose simultaneous study allows us to probe in detail the structure of the accretion disc and the contribution of the secondary .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the echelle package routines in iraf , while the extraction of the orders and the wavelength calibration were performed by the echelle package reduction task doecslit .",
    "the continuum contribution was subtracted by fitting a cubic spline to the appropriate parts of each order in each spectrum .    -0.2",

    "ip peg in contrast to other dwarf novae does not develop absorption lines during outburst ( piche & szkody , 1989 ) .",
    "a probable explanation could be its high inclination i@xmath081@xmath1 that reduces the contribution of the accretion disc absorption lines . from the output spectra",
    "no absorption lines were identified , while the 9 most prominent emission lines were selected for further studying .",
    "these include the balmer series h@xmath2 , h@xmath3 , h@xmath4 , h@xmath5 , four hei lines with wavelengths 7065 , 6678 , 5876 , 4922 and one heii line at 4686 .",
    "the phase folded spectra of all the selected emission lines are plotted in figure 1 .",
    "the orbital ephemeris for the calculation of the corresponding phases was taken from wolf et al .",
    "( 1993 ) .    in figure 1",
    ", we detect the characteristic s - wave of a low - velocity emission from the secondary , which reaches maximum at phase 0.5 when the secondary is seen face - on .",
    "we also see a clear variation in the line profiles and in particular a variation of the separation between the red and blue - shifted emission peaks originating in the accretion disc .      as a next step we made a preliminary attempt to apply doppler imaging on our unique set of spectra . using henk spruit s code ( spruit 1998 , http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/~henk/pub/dopmap),we constructed doppler maps ( figure 2 ) . despite some clear artifacts , which are , among others , caused by prominent spikes near the emission lines ( as seen in some cases in figure 1 ) the two spiral arms are visible in each of the doppler maps . depending on the emission line the intensity of the spiral arms as well as of the secondary star varies .",
    "the comparison between these different simultaneous maps will bring invaluable information on the source of the spiral arms and the structure of the accretion flow .",
    "this work is now in progress ."
