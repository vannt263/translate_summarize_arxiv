    "covariance functions are a key element in the regression of geospatial data ( kriging ) .",
    "designing a covariance function that can capture the geospatial random field of natural processes is useful for understanding the changes occurring in climate related variables .",
    "for example , ongoing sea level changes provide an important context for understanding future coastal flood risks  @xcite . however , most of the climate related datasets at a global scale suffer from statistical issues of non - stationarity and non - uniformly smooth spatial boundaries . in this paper",
    ", we design a covariance function which addresses these issues in the datasets .",
    "-1    stochastic processes of complex systems at a global scale are known to have a regional geophysical variability .",
    "for example , the local sea - level changes occurring near northern europe are primarily dominated by the physics of the glacial - isostatic adjustment , while the local sea - level changes occurring near japan are dominated by the tectonics  @xcite .",
    "such regional variations can be modeled using the non - stationary covariance function ( figures  [ fig : orig](a , b ) depicts these issues ) .",
    "-1    one of the important modeling issues in the complex geospatial dataset at a global scale is knowing the boundaries of the regional geophysical variability . addressing this issue , which we call the non - uniformly smooth spatial boundary issue , aids in modeling the non - stationary covariance function by capturing the underlying correlation structure of a region .",
    "this paper addresses this issue for kriging .",
    "-1    for standard kriging models ( gp ) , the methods given in  @xcite are widely used in many climate models , including models of the sea level data , because it gives a non - parametric method for analyzing such a geospatial random field .",
    "such a model can be completely defined by its covariance function , and it learns the hyper - parameters of the designed covariance function directly from the training data without making any parametric assumptions about the data .  -1    to model the non - stationarity of the stochastic process ,  @xcite devised a non - stationary covariance function . these methods use spatially evolving smooth kernels to represent the characteristic length scale ( cls ) of the covariance function , which , in turn , models the local correlation structure of the global scale stochastic process . from these methods ,",
    "@xcite is the most promising approach for climate data , as its model is entirely in the non - parametric gp framework .",
    "even so , it uses a homogeneous set of hyper - parameters to ensure the smoothness of the cls in the input space .",
    "we show in our experiments that using a homogeneous set of hyperparameters is inefficient for the global - scale complex systems .",
    "-1    non - stationarity has also been addressed by  @xcite .",
    "they use a multi - resolution basis function , fixed rectangular grid , and explicit thresholding scheme .",
    "the approach of setting fixed grids renders this method unviable for datasets with non - uniformly smooth boundaries .",
    "while  @xcite validates their model on precipitation estimates in colorada ( usa ) ,  @xcite uses the daily ozone rate in the midwest .",
    "both of these datasets are locally dense , and , in turn , do not address the global scale climate data issues .",
    "-1    in the literature of estimating global scale sea - level changes , techniques given by  @xcite use a kalman filter model , and  @xcite use a mixture of gps at various regional resolutions . however , these methods fail to tightly couple the local and global estimates in the spatial dimension . additionally , these methods rely on the domain knowledge and a parametric framework .",
    "-1 in this paper , we propose a covariance function to model the data and address the aforementioned issues at a global scale , and we call this covariance function the intrinsic non - stationary covariance function .",
    "we use intrinsic statistics  @xcite on the space of the cls to capture the non - uniformly smooth spatial boundaries for the non - stationarity .",
    "furthermore , we provide an algorithm for kriging using the proposed intrinsic covariance function , and we validate its applicability on two global scale datasets .  -1    [ fig : gia ]    [ fig : sl ]",
    "in this section , we provide relevant background about stationary and non - stationary covariance functions used in kriging , which helped in the development of our proposed framework of the intrinsic non - stationary covariance function .",

    "consequently , this results in a variable cls at the target values ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "-1      for modeling the cls ,  @xcite uses a predetermined area of the ellipse ,  @xcite uses b - splines , and  @xcite uses a stationary gp .",

    "all four independent gps have their own sets of hyperparamters .",
    "in this section , we first propose our model of the covariance function ( intrinsic non - stationary covariance function ) , then give background for the intrinsic statistics that we employ to construct the intrinsic non - stationary covariance , and finally provide an algorithm for its implementation in kriging .    in order to improve the model of the non - stationary covariance function that captures the variable regional information ,",

    "figure  [ fig : frame ] depicts these two factors , and section  [ sec : method ] gives one such method to construct these classes of functions .",
    "the intrinsic non - stationary covariance function , as defined above , is a valid non - stationary covariance function .",
    "@xcite shows that the construction of a covariance function using a moving average specification ( i.e. , convolution of kernels ) leads to a non - stationary process . in our construction (",

    "algorithm [ alg : method ] describes our framework for implementing the intrinsic non - stationary covariance function , and figure [ fig : frame ] depicts this general framework .",
    "we first obtain initial smooth estimates of the cls ( @xmath50 ) by equation , and then we update @xmath50 with the aim of modeling the intrinsic function @xmath82 using our approach proposed in algorithm [ alg : knn ] .",

    "we used the empirical riemannian mean rather than the arithmetic mean and , therefore , are free from fixing the bounds on the initial estimates of @xmath101 .",

    "it would be worth exploring how the different statistical measures on the manifold of the cls space could improve the kriging estimates when sharp jumps exist in the underlying distribution .",
    "-1    for example , a cls computation of a geospatial location that is close to the boundary of its geophysical region is less reliable when it is the function of its input space alone ( i.e. , @xmath50 in algorithm  [ alg : method ] , step 3 ) .",
    "however , when the additional information of the neighboring cls is incorporated into the model ( i.e. , algorithm  [ alg : knn ] , step 4 and 5 ) , one could potentially recover the cls of the boundary points that is closer ( equation  [ eq : mean ] ) to the cls representative of its associated region .",

    "to gain insight into the applicability of our proposed covariance function , we implemented and compared kriging with three different covariance functions : the widely used stationary anisotropic matrn covariance function ( statgp ) of  @xcite , the baseline non - stationary covariance function ( nsgp ) of  @xcite , and the intrinsic non - stationary covariance function ( insgp ) that we propose in this paper .",
    "these methods were evaluated using two standard performance measures ( as described below ) for kriging .",
    "the three datasets used are : the smooth 2@xmath7 simulated dataset ( sim ) given in  @xcite , the geophysics driven synthetic data ( gia ) as modeled in  @xcite , and the global - scale complex naturally occurring real dataset ( tg ) collected in  @xcite .  -1    _ the simulated dataset_. for this study , we are interested in comparing our method with the 2@xmath7 simulated functions that have been previously used in the non - stationary covariance function literature . the experimental set up is given in  @xcite . even though the simulation function is non - stationary , it is fairly smooth and homogeneous , and it lacks the complex regional geophysics that is usually encountered in global - scale climate related data .  -1    _ the synthetic dataset_. for this study , we are interested in modeling the global - scale geophysical signal that is present in the climate datasets ( such as tide gauge data ) .",
    "this synthetic dataset enables us to compare the three covariance functions ( statgp , nsgp , insgp ) with known geophysics boundaries .",
    "-1 one such widely modeled geophysical signal is the glacial - isostatic adjustment ( gia ) model .",
