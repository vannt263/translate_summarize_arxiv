    "generally people can utilize an external field to manipulate the time evolution of a quantum system from an arbitrary initial state to reach any wanted target state .",
    "if the external field is classical and can be artificially controlled to be time - dependent , then we refer this kind of manipulation as a classical control @xcite . in quantum computations",
    "@xcite , the quantum logic gate operations can be regarded as classical controls in most cases where the controller is essentially classical and the control can be turned on or off classically at certain instants .    in this paper we consider the quantum control , in which the controller is quantized and obeys the laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "it is shown that the back action of the controlled system should be considered , which may have a negative side - effect on the controllability .",
    "there are two motivations for our investigations .",
    "firstly , it is exciting to explore the finiteness of human being s abilities to control the nature , and a  down - to - earth \" starting point for this exploration in physics should be a concrete model even though it is oversimplified . with some reasonable models one could demonstrate how the fundamental laws of physics impose the limits on the controllability in principle .",
    "these refer to some basic issues in physics , such as the energy bound , the basic precision of measurement ( or standard quantum limit ( sql)@xcite ) .",
    "it is emphasized that the quantum decoherence may result from _ the control itself _ when the controller is essentially considered as a quantum subsystem .",
    "secondly , though the physical implementation of quantum computation seems to be difficult , the huge power of quantum computation has been demonstrated by some quantum algorithms in principle . the limit of quantum control can bring a physical limit to quantum computation architecture since it is based on complete quantum blocks including the controller .",
    "lloyd discussed how the physical constants impose a limit on the power and the memory in the quantum computer @xcite , while ozawa and gea - banacloche ozawa2002,julio2002b considered the conservation law and the minimum energy requirement for quantum computation respectively .",
    "our present study can also be regarded as a part of the growing body of the explorations in this direction .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : single ] , we start with a model with a single mode field as a controller and a two - level system ( qubit ) as the controlled system .",
    "we found that it is possible to implement some phase gate controls without inducing decoherence to the controlled system .",
    "however , the single mode example is far from practical cases , and thus we further study the quantum control in a more general case in sec .",

    "an inequality similar to the heisenberg uncertainty relation is presented as the accurate bound of quantum gates under the quantum control .",
    "to have a clear picture about the quantum control , let us first start with a simple model .",
    "the total system that we concern is closed , which consists of the controller @xmath0 with the hamiltonian @xmath1 and the controlled system @xmath2 with the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "the system is in the initial states @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively , where @xmath6 represents the controlling parameters . for a given target state @xmath7 of @xmath2 ,",
    "the quantum control is described as a factorized evolution @xmath8 of the total system driven by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath9 within the time duration @xmath10 .",

    "usually @xmath12 defines a quantum logic operation in quantum computation .",
    "we now consider an exactly soluble example , where the controlled system is a qubit with two basis states @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the controller is a single mode boson field with free hamiltonian @xmath15 , here @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator .",
    "the interaction @xmath18 between them is of non - demolition@xcite , i.e. , @xmath19\\neq 0 $ ] and @xmath20=0 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath3 is conserved during the evolution we take @xmath21 without loss of the generality . in the interaction picture",
    "the time - dependent potential @xmath22 acts only on the state @xmath14 , but not on @xmath13 .",
    "this hamiltonian originates from the atom - field system in the large detuning limit , but the problem is greatly simplified for convenience @xcite .",
    "now we explore the possibility of automatically creating a phase gate operation @xmath23 driven by @xmath9 .",
    "essentially , the phase gate operation is supposed to generate a relative phase @xmath24 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the total system experiences a factorized evolution @xmath25 we will show that , only a class of phase gates with special phases depending on the global parameters , such as the coupling coefficients @xmath26 and the gate operation time @xmath27 , can be implemented precisely , while the other phase gates definitely result in a decoherence in the qubit system , and can only be implemented in an inaccurate way .",
    "obviously the hamiltonian @xmath28 describes a typical conditional dynamics @xcite .",
    "let the total system be initially in a superposition of @xmath29 where the boson field is in a coherent state @xmath30 .",

    "therefore some target states are obtained as the superpositions state of @xmath13 and @xmath14 with specific relative phases that can be implemented perfectly by the quantum control .    however",

    "a quantum gate operation is accomplished by the controlled system .",

    "this uncertainty relation is also responsible for the decoherences induced by the detector as well as those induced by the quantum control .",
    "roughly speaking , the variation @xmath99 is relavent to the induced decoherence in the qubit system , while the term @xmath100 is associated with the power or the average energy of the controller .",
    "the conservation laws throw some limits on such implementation of quantum gates @xcite .",
    "for example , a quantum control to complete a cnot gate usually concerns the transfer of some conservation quantities between qubits . to focus on the problems in the following",

    ", it is expected that a quantum computer could work like electronic computers : when the programs are designed then stored in it initially , the quantum computer should be able to carry out computations without any other assistants .",
    "the basic requirement for the quantum control is that the interaction can be switched on and off automatically at certain instants , e.g. , at @xmath89 and @xmath45 , @xmath107where @xmath108 .",

    "the sandwich @xmath109 is defined as the average of the operator @xmath105 over the controller state .",
    "this means that the effective interaction is obtained by taking the average of @xmath110 over the instantaneous controller states @xmath111 .",
    "generally , the controller in physical implementations of the quantum control are various fields that are supposed to be classical .",
    "for example , the microwave electromagnetic fields are used to manipulate the nuclear spin - qubits in nmr , the laser fields are applied to control the atomic qubits and the classical magnetic flux and voltage are utilized to adjust the josephson - junction based qubits .",
    "however , the controlling fields are essentially of quantization and are usually described by coherent states or some quantum mechanical mixture .",

    "this is due to the randomness of relative phases @xcite from the quantum control .",
    "furthermore , we can conclude from the above exact solution that the large random phase change just originates from heisenberg s position - momentum uncertainty relation @xmath153 .",
    "this observation will help us to discover a bound on the quantum control .",
    "based on our previous explorations on the relation between the two explanations for quantum decoherence @xcite , using the position - momentum uncertainty relation , we now can associate the physical limit of quantum control with the standard quantum limit ( sql ) in quantum measurement context @xcite through a concrete example as follows .",

    "the potential @xmath110 exerts on the qubit state @xmath166 but not on the qubit state @xmath13 .",
    "then the evolution can be obtained as @xmath167where @xmath168we can explicitly calculate the phase operator @xmath169 defined above by the method similarly to that used for the example about the single mode field in sec .",

    "we consider the uncertainty relation@xmath253\\rangle |=\\frac{1}{2}|\\langle \\mathbf{\\phi } _ { a}\\rangle |   \\label{eqn : aa}\\]]about dpo and the photon number operator @xmath254 .    to derive the above uncertainty relation ( [ eqn : aa ] ) , we have considered @xmath255for the average @xmath256 over the coherent state @xmath257    the novel uncertainty relation ( [ eqn : aa ] ) defines a low bound for the phase variation @xmath258 for a given phase @xmath259 to be achieved by the quantum control , i.e. @xmath260eq.([eqn : maine ] ) clearly implies that we need much larger energy to reduce the low bound of the phase fluctuation .",
    "actually , we can formally write down the expectation of the photon energy of the controller @xmath261 in terms of the average photon number @xmath262 and the average frequency of photons @xmath263then eq.([eqn : maine ] ) becomes @xmath264the small low bound requires that a large quantum controller ( implied by large @xmath265 or large energy @xmath266 )  possesses a very small average frequency . in this sense eq.([eqn : aa ] ) defines a necessary condition for the quantum control that can manipulate the qubit system reaching the target state accurately .",
    "this requirement is very similar to that the apparatus should be sufficiently  so large `` that to be ' ' classical `` in the quantum measurement in the so - called copenhagen interpretation '' .",
    "since the quantum control relies on the ability to preserve quantum coherence of the qubit system during controlling it , the controller should be much larger \" than the controlled system . in this sense",
    ", the bac - action of the qubit system on the controller can be neglected .",
    "next we consider the controllable condition ( [ eqn : c - condition ] ) that the controller field is switched on and off over a time duration @xmath27 , which can be roughly realized as a periodical phenomenon with the average period @xmath267 .",
    "since the average frequency of the field can be approximated by @xmath268 , there is a low bound @xmath269for the error measure estimation of @xmath270 of the quantum control .",
    "so the larger action @xmath271 from the controller is brought on the qubit system , the less quantum decoherence characterized by the control induced error @xmath272 becomes ; the more one wants to change by the phase @xmath259 of the qubit system , the larger quantum decoherence is induced by the quantum control . therefore eq.([eqn : inequality ] ) imposes a fundamental limit on the accuracy of quantum control . in the following",
    "we can consider this physical limit for quantum computing     is the number of qubits consisted in the quantum algorithm .",
    "the horizontal line at about @xmath273 indicates the age of universe . ]",
    "it is well known that the controllability of qubits is a basic requirement for universal quantum computations , but according to the above arguments a well - armed controls in quantum computing would cause the extra decoherence in the qubits system .",
    "thus in competition with the induced decoherence , the controllability for quantum computation is limited .    in the last section",
    "a low bound of decoherence from the quantum control is obtained .",
    "it throws an accuracy limit to the quantum controls in quantum computation . according to eq.([eqn : inequality ] ) this limit is about @xmath274 for the typical setting @xmath275 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 in an ion trap schemes .",
    "this is such a small limit that it is negligible in comparison with other errors , such as the environments induced errors in the current experiments of implementing quantum computation .",
    "however , in principle , eq.([eqn : inequality ] ) do throw a fundamental limit to the accuracy of the quantum control and thus on quantum computations .",
    "there are some numerical estimates in fig.algorithms , which demonstrate the similar limit to the power of quantum computer .",
    "it is known that for an algorithm consisting of @xmath278 operations on the qubits system , an up bound of error @xmath279 is required in each operation for a faithful result of the entire computation .",
    "the inequality eq.([eqn : inequality ] ) tells us that the minimum amount of time needed for a single gate is @xmath280and so the total time needed to carry out a particular algorithm consisting of @xmath278 elementary gates is about @xmath281 .    for a general algorithm as an arbitrary unitary operation on @xmath282 , the amount of elementary gates",
    "@xmath278 needed is about @xmath283 barenco ; for the grover algorithm on @xmath282 , the amount is about @xmath284 ; for the shor large number factorization , the amount is about @xmath285 . the time duration needed for a general algorithm ,",
    "the grover algorithm and the shor s algorithm are estimated with the optimistic assumptions , in which the only restriction is from the quantum control .",
    "thus , in fig.[algorithms ] it could be found that the practise of quantum computation heavily depends on the sophisticated quantum algorithms and arbitrary quantum operations on about several tens qubits is already inaccessible even in principle .",
    "this handicap on the quantum computation stands when the quantum computation is carried out by tandem elementary gates under the quantum control .",
    "in this paper we present a universal description for the quantum control based on the quantized controller .",
    "we discovered the complementarity about the competition between the controllability and the control induced quantum decoherence in the view of quantum measurement .",
    "starting with an exactly - soluble example , a general model of quantum control is proposed to describe this novel complementarity or a new type of uncertainty relation .",
    "our investigations show that it is possible to realize the decoherence free quantum controls only with some special phases at the finite energy scale and in finite time .",
    "if the parameters of phase is to be determined by the initial state of the controller , then there exists a low bound for the systematic errors resulted from the decoherence cause by the quantum control itself .",
    "the above arguments also show that the decoherences from the quantum control are different from those induced by the environments through the unwanted interactions .",
    "this is because the negative influence of the controller happens in the quantum control process itself .",
    "if one eliminates this influence out and out , the positive role of the quantum control would perish together .",
    "therefore , for quantum computing , these kinds of errors induced by the control itself can not be overcame totally by the conventional error management protocols @xcite .",
    "at least , it has not been proved that the control induced decoherences can also be conquered efficiently by the well - estabilished error management protocols . the better method to solve",
    "this problem is to optimize the control operations when the target of control is given . without doubt",
    ", this is an open question to challenge for the physical implementation of quantum computing as well as the other protocols of quantum information processing .",
