    "jigsaw puzzles provide a graphic example , with the dents and bumps as local rules .",
    "tilings and local rules only relatively recently went beyond recreational mathematics .",
    "the first major step occured in the early 60 s , when the logician hao wang asked in @xcite if there exists an algorithm which decides whether any given finite set of tiles can tile the whole plane ( each tile can be used several times ) .",
    "his student robert berger gave a negative answer in @xcite , with a key ingredient of his proof being the first - ever tile set which can tile the plane but only in a non - periodic way ( that is , no tiling is invariant by a non - trivial translation ) .",
    "such tile sets are said to be _",
    "some other examples were since then discovered , with the most celebrated one probably being the penrose tiles @xcite .",
    "the second major step occured twenty years later , with the ground - breaking discovery by dan shechtman of _ quasicrystals _ , that are non - periodic but nevertheless ordered materials @xcite .",
    "the link with ( ordered ) non - periodic tilings was indeed quickly done , with local rules modeling the energetic finite - range interactions between atoms @xcite .",
    "a primordial issue in mathematical physics then became to determine which type of quasicrystalline structure can exist .",
    "+ in this paper , we focus on the case of the rhombus tilings of the plane .",
    "such tilings can indeed profitably be seen as digitizations of surfaces in higher dimensional spaces . among them",
    "are the plane digitizations obtained by the so - called _ canonical cut and projection _ method ( see @xcite ) .",
    "they are said to be _ planar _ and aim to model the long - range order of quasicrystals .",
    "this connects the algebraic parameters of a plane with the geometry of its digitization , and one of main issues is : which planes have a digitization characterized by local rules ?",
    "note that rhombus tilings are surely far from comprising all the existing tilings , but they nevertheless provide a large family which can notably model all the quasicrystalline symmetries yet experimentally observed , with the exception of the icosahedral one ( which requires rhombohedra tilings of the three - dimensional space ; we actually checked that our method extends to this specific case ) .",
    "+ we also focus on a special kind of local rules , namely _ uncolored weak _ ones .",
    "formally , local rules can be expressed as a finite set of finite patterns that must be avoided ( _ forbidden patterns _ ) .",
    "they are _ colored _ when the same tile can appear in different colors in the forbidden patterns , thus playing different roles . colored local rules are more powerful but also less realistic from the physical viewpoint ( the model is even more complicated ) .",
    "this could explain why uncolored ones have retained the attention of many authors .",
    "_ weak _ local rules have been introduced for planar rhombus tilings by leonid levitov in @xcite , as opposed to _",
    "strong _ local rules .",
    "whereas strong local rules enforce a tiling to be a specific digitization of a plane , weak ones only require the digitization to stay at bounded distance from a plane .",
    "in other words , weak local rules allow short - range disorder ( some authors speak about _ bounded perp - space fluctuations _ ) .",
    "+ so , which planar rhombus tilings do admit weak uncolored local rules ?",
    "this has been an issue of much debate in mathematical physics during the early 90 s ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "several conditions have been found , usually stated in terms of algebraic properties of the digitized plane , but no complete characterization has yet emerged . at a minimum , examples of non - periodic tilings do exist ( _ e.g. _ , the penrose tilings ) . at the other extreme ,",
    "thang le has proved in @xcite that digitized plane admitting weak uncolored local rules are always generated by vectors whose entries are algebraic numbers .",
    "let us mention , in comparison , that a plane digitization is proven in @xcite to admit weak _ colored _ local rules if and only if the plane can be generated by _ computable",
    "_ vectors ( that is , their entries can be computed to within any desired precision by a finite , terminating algorithm ) . +",
    "our results are along those lines .",
    "we rely on the notion of _ subperiod _ , which is related to the _ si - condition _ introduced by leonid levitov in @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the vectors which generate an irrational plane can nevertheless have rational depencies between their entries .",
    "the subperiods catch such kind of dependencies , which turn out to easily translate into equations on the grassmann coordinates of the plane , yielding a system of polynomial equations .",
    "the point is that the subperiods can be enforced by specific local rules .",
    "our main result , roughly stated , is that the existence of such specific local rules is equivalent to the zero - dimensionality of the corresponding system of polynomial equations ( at least when the digitized plane lives in @xmath1 , corollary  [ cor : local_rules_codim2 ] ) . actually , a fruitful approach turned out to isolate the subquestion of planarity : when do the local rules associated with the subperiods of a plane allow only rhombus tilings which are digitizations of ( any ) planes ?",
    "theorem  [ th : planarity_codim2 ] gives an answer when , again , the plane lives in @xmath1 .",
