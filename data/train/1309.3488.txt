    "transport processes are widespread and commonly occur in many fields of physics , chemistry , and biology . in electronic and photonic systems , the chemical potential as well as the temperature are normally treated as independently controllable parameters @xcite .    in equilibrium thermodynamics ,",
    "the chemical potential is in general a function of the intensive properties of the gas such as , e.g. , temperature and particle density . in most setups studied so far , assuming an independent",
    ", constant chemical potential is a valid conjecture , since the transport setup is usually embedded in a much larger environment .",
    "this surrounding environment acts as a particle and temperature reservoir providing the necessary resources to fix the chemical potential at a constant value .",
    "however , there are also transport setups which can not be treated in this manner .",
    "in particular , there has been a lot of progress in the production and manipulation of ultracold quantum gases .",
    "this includes the production of bose - einstein condensates in electromagnetic traps @xcite or even in standing light fields @xcite that allow for an experimental implementation of hubbard - type quantum models @xcite .",
    "these ultracold atomic gases have been studied in equilibrium situations for quite a while and with huge success . nowadays , the focus shifts to investigating the nonequilibrium properties of such systems @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been the first real transport experiments with ultracold atoms @xcite . in these setups ,",
    "the transport processes are driven by at least two reservoirs which are initialized in different equilibrium states and attached to the system of interest . accompanying these experimental advances ,",
    "there has been also theoretical research involving atomic reservoirs coupled to , e.g. , a lattice system @xcite , a potential trap @xcite , or even quantum dot systems @xcite .",
    "since the ultracold atoms are trapped in a high - vacuum chamber , the gas is well separated from its environment such that no additional particle reservoir is present .",
    "therefore , in these experiments the particle density is constant and the chemical potential can not be treated as free accessible parameter but becomes a function of the temperature and particle number in the trap .",
    "this strongly motivates us to investigate the influence of such a temperature- and particle - density - dependent chemical potential on the transport properties of a two - terminal open quantum system setup .",
    "this analysis is especially interesting for systems that undergo quantum phase transitions .",
    "for example , transport through such systems contains information about such transitions even in extreme nonequilibrium setups @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that such transitions only occur in the thermodynamic limit ( infinite system size ) , which suggests to investigate the role of criticality within the reservoirs .",
    "in fact , criticality is normally associated with a characteristic change in the chemical potential .",
    "hence , it is crucial to describe the chemical potential in dependence of the thermodynamic state variables of the gas in order to correctly describe these critical phenomena .    within this paper ,",
    "we particularly investigate the difference between the transport of fermionic and bosonic particles through such systems .",
    "since an ideal bose gas shows a quantum phase transition from a normal phase to a bose - einstein condensate in thermodynamic equilibrium , we expect to find signatures of this critical reservoir behavior in the transport coefficients .    in sec .",

    "the main difference of our setup compared to the usual schemes to describe transport through nanostructures lies in the utilization of massive ultracold atoms with a temperature- and density - dependent chemical potential .",
    "consequently , the reservoirs are modeled as ideal quantum gases in the thermodynamic limit .    due to their statistical properties ,",
    "bosonic reservoirs are fundamentally different from their electronic counterpart . in particular , the bosonic reservoirs undergo a quantum phase transition from a normal phase to a bose - einstein condensate @xcite .",
    "therefore , criticality is induced in the transport setup via the reservoirs .",
    "this critical behavior of the reservoirs is discussed in more detail in the following .",
    "the atomic baths are modeled as ideal gases of massive particles with a bath hamiltonian given by @xmath0 with operators @xmath1 and @xmath2 creating and annihilating a particle with momentum @xmath3 and energy @xmath4 in reservoir @xmath5 .",
    "note that we use natural units throughout this paper , i.e. , @xmath6 . in the weak coupling limit",
    "the reservoirs enter additively , such that it suffices to consider here just a single reservoir .",
    "therefore , we will drop the reservoir index @xmath5 in this section .",

    "here , we have introduced the inverse temperature @xmath10 and the chemical potential @xmath11 . since the lowest energy level of a free quantum gas is given by @xmath12 the positivity of the mean occupation demands that for bosons , in contrast to the electronic case , the chemical potential is restricted to negative values @xmath13 .",
    "the exact value of the chemical potential in the grand canonical ensemble is determined by the condition that the mean total number of particles @xmath14 is constant .",

    "however , when replacing the sum by an integral , we need to take extra care of the ground - state occupation in the bosonic case , since in the regime where @xmath23 it can be macroscopically occupied .",
    "this phenomenon does not occur in a fermi gas due to the pauli principle and is known as bose - einstein condensation @xcite .    keeping this in mind",

    "the explicit ground - state contribution @xmath28 is only present in bose gases .",
    "this equation implicitly defines the chemical potential @xmath29 as a function of temperature and mean particle density .        due to the complexity of the poly - logarithm",

    "of special interest for the further calculations are the first derivatives of the chemical potential in the thermal phase which can be calculated from eq .",
    "to @xmath30 in a real experiment with cold atoms , the chemical potential can not be tuned directly by applying an external voltage as usually considered for electronic transport .",
    "instead one can introduce a thermal or density bias which causes a bias in the chemical potentials of the reservoirs . from the left panel in fig .",
    "[ f : chemicalpotential ] we can see that applying a positive temperature bias at constant density where @xmath31 results in an opposite chemical potential bias @xmath32 .",
    "the same effect occurs for a density bias at constant temperature .",
    "furthermore , if the particle density is kept constant , one finds characteristic temperatures for the respective ideal quantum gases . for a fermi gas",
    ", one defines the fermi temperature @xmath33 that relates to the fermi energy @xmath34 which equals the chemical potential at absolute zero , i.e. , @xmath35 .    for a bose",
    "gas one finds a critical temperature @xmath36 where the chemical potential vanishes and all particles start to condense in the same ground state .",
    "thus , for temperatures below the critical point the bose gas is in a mixed phase consisting of a normal thermal phase and a condensate fraction .",

    "this master equation is conditioned on the number @xmath63 of particles tunneled via one reservoir into or out of the system and the amount of energy @xmath67 transfered from this reservoir into the system . due to conservation laws",
