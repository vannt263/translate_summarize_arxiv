    "<S> we have investigated multiband optical photometric variability and stability of the h@xmath0 line profile of the transient x - ray binary igr j01583 + 6713 . </S>",
    "<S> we set an upper limit of 0.05 mag on photometric variations in the _ v _ band over a time scale of 3 months . </S>",
    "<S> the h@xmath0 line is found to consist of non - gaussian profile and quite stable for a duration of 2 months . </S>",
    "<S> we have identified the spectral type of the companion star to be b2 i ve while distance to the source is estimated to be @xmath1 4.0 kpc . along with the optical observations , we have also carried out analysis of x - ray data from three short observations of the source , two with the _ swift_xrt and one with the _ rxte_pca . </S>",
    "<S> we have detected a variation in the absorption column density , from a value of 22.0 @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 immediately after the outburst down to 2.6 @xmath2 10@xmath3 @xmath4 four months afterwards . in the quiescent state , </S>",
    "<S> the x - ray absorption is consistent with the optical reddening measurement of e(b - v ) = 1.46 mag . from one of the _ swift _ observations , during which the x - ray intensity was higher , we have a possible pulse detection with a period of 469.2 s. for a be x - ray binary , this indicates an orbital period in the range of 216561 days for this binary system .    </S>",
