    "the nonthermal radio continuum emission from the galaxy at frequencies below 100  mhz is the synchrotron radiation of cosmic ray electrons with energies of order 1 gev .",

    "the opacity of the thermal component of galactic emission is often sufficient to absorb the much brighter background synchrotron emission , providing a means of estimating local synchrotron emissivities in the directions of regions at known distances .",

    "the 22 mhz telescope at the drao was used in the period 1965 to 1969 to measure the emission from discrete sources and to map the background radiation from our galaxy .",
    "the telescope has been described completely by costain et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ; only those details relevant to the present paper are given here .",
    "flux densities of point sources have been published by roger et al .",

    "the low - frequency spectra of these sources have been discussed by roger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "technical problems prevented a satisfactory calibration of the galactic emission , but these problems have now been circumvented and in this paper we present a map of the galactic emission at 22  mhz between declinations @xmath028  and @xmath180covering the complete range of right ascension , @xmath273%   of the sky . by comparing the 22  mhz map with the 408  mhz data from the all - sky survey of haslam et al .",
    "( @xcite ) we have prepared a map of the spectral index of the emission over the same area .",
    "we also derive values of the local synchrotron emissivity .",
    "the telescope was an unfilled aperture in the form of a t with dimensions 96@xmath11 @xmath4 2.5@xmath11 east - west ( ew ) and 32.5@xmath11 @xmath4 4@xmath11 north - south ( ns ) .",
    "this array formed a nearly gaussian beam of extent 1.1 @xmath4 1.7 degrees ( ew @xmath4 ns ) at the zenith ( declination 48.8 ) . the telescope was operated as a meridian transit instrument , steerable in declination between @xmath030  and the north celestial pole by the adjustment of the phases of rows of dipole elements in the north - south direction . away from the zenith ,",
    "foreshortening of the array broadened the beam in this direction to 1.7  secant(z ) , where z is the zenith angle .",
    "the gain of the telescope in directions away from the zenith was further reduced by the response of the basic array element , a full - wave dipole @xmath12 above a reflecting screen .",
    "aperture grading by means of attenuators was used to keep sidelobes to a level of a few percent .",
    "the pencil - beam response was formed by multiplying the signals from the ew and ns arms .",
    "a problem in t and cross  format telescopes arises from the region in which the two arms intersect .",
    "if this region is removed , a broad negative response is produced around the narrow pencil beam , and the telescope filters out the lowest spatial frequencies , leading to a poor representation of the broadest angular components of the emission . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the signals from the elements in the overlap region were split and fed to both the ew and ns arrays .",
    "the gain of the antenna ( in effect the ratio between the flux density of a radio source and the antenna temperature it produces in the main beam ) was established using an assumed flux density of 29100 @xmath13 1500 jy for cygnus a. details of the original flux - density scale and the subsequent revision can be found in roger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and in roger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "observations were made in several modes during the working life of the telescope . in the early part of the observation period the telescope formed only one beam which could be moved in declination by operating the ns phasing switches .",
    "long scans at fixed declination were made to observe the background emission as well as point sources , and short scans were made to measure the flux density of point sources with the beam switched frequently between different declinations .",
    "only the scans of long duration were used to assemble the data presented in this paper . at a later stage , more automated phasing switches were added to permit rapid time  shared observations at five adjacent declinations .",
    "a large fraction of the present data was obtained from long scans with this equipment .",
    "scans were made at a set of standard declinations , chosen to sample the emission at half - beamwidth intervals . since the ns beamwidth increased with increasing zenith angle , the standard declinations were not evenly spaced .",
    "the observations were made mostly in the years 1965 to 1969 which covered a period of fairly low solar activity .",
    "nevertheless , because of the low frequency of operation , the influence of the ionosphere on the observations was often large .",
    "observations of point sources were affected by refraction , scintillation , and absorption in differing degrees . a correction factor for ionospheric absorption ( primarily a daytime phenomenon )",
    "was derived from an on  site 22 mhz riometer and was applied to the data .",
    "refraction amounting to a significant fraction of the ( ew ) beam was detected only near times of sunrise in the ionosphere when large horizontal gradients of electron density were present .",
    "scintillation of `` point sources '' ( sources less than 15  diameter ) was a frequent occurrence . due to lack of correlation of the phase and amplitude variations over the extent of the telescope array during times of severe scintillation , flux densities could be seriously underestimated . to overcome this problem ,",
    "many observations of each source were made and measurements of flux density were derived from only those observations judged to be the least affected . by contrast , most observations of the extended emission were largely unaffected by scintillation and , after correction for absorption , could be reliably averaged together .",
    "the data presented here are the result of averaging at least two observations , and in many parts of the sky up to five good observations contributed to the average .",
    "thus , the basic data set is a data array assembled from the averaged scans at the standard declinations . because neighbouring averaged scans contained data observed at different times with varying conditions , the array displayed significant scanning artifacts . these were greatly reduced by the application of a fourier filtering process in the declination dimension .",
    "the data were then interpolated onto a grid sampled at 1 minute intervals in right ascension and 15   in declination .",
    "comparison of the resulting map with maps at higher frequencies suggested that the brightness temperature calibration of the 22 mhz map had a zenith  angle ",
    "dependent error .",
    "we used the 408 mhz all - sky survey of haslam et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for comparisons because these single ",
    "parabloid observations would likely be free of such defects , but comparisons with other similar data sets would probably have produced similar conclusions .",
    "for comparison with the 22 mhz map we convolved the 408 mhz data from its original resolution of 51   to the variable beamwidth of our data .",
    "calculation of a map of spectral index between the two frequencies indicated a systematic variation of spectral index with declination .",
    "since such an effect is unlikely to be real , we suspected a calibration problem in the 22 mhz data .",
    "although the cause is not fully understood , we believe that the response of the telescope to extended structure differed from its response to point sources in directions away from the zenith .",
    "this effect is discussed in section 6.2 .",
    "we believe , however , that the response of the telescope at the zenith ( declination 48.8 ) _ is _ well understood . at this declination",
    ", we plotted brightness temperature at 22 mhz against brightness temperature at 408 mhz ( a t - t plot ) .",
    "we used data at all right ascensions except ( a ) near the galactic plane in the cygnus region ( at @xmath221@xmath10 , 48 ) where strong absorption features are evident in the 22 mhz map ( see below ) and ( b ) regions around a few strong small - diameter sources . fig .",
    "1 shows this plot . the highest temperatures in fig .",
    "1 correspond to the galactic plane in the anticentre ( at 4@xmath10 40@xmath14 , 48 ) where there may be a small amount of absorption , causing the t - t plot to deviate from a straight line .",
    "using all the data shown in fig .  1 we derived a differential spectral index of 2.52@xmath13.02 . restricting the fit to regions with @xmath15  kk ( corresponding to right ascensions between 5@xmath10 40@xmath14 and 18@xmath10 10@xmath14 ) the correlation is very tight and the differential spectral index is 2.57@xmath13.02",
    ". these values of spectral index are close to the value expected in this frequency range from the work of bridle ( @xcite ) and sironi ( @xcite ) indicating that the temperature scale at 22 mhz is accurate .",
    "furthermore , the extrapolation of the line fitted to the data points passes close to the origin of the t - t plot , giving us confidence that the zero level of the 22 mhz measurements is also well established at the zenith .",
    "t - t plot analyses at other declinations ( again excluding areas of absorption ) indicate that the zero level is acceptably correct throughout the declination range , but that the temperature scale varies ( the accuracy of the zero level is discussed in section 6.1 ) .",
    "the temperature scale at declinations away from the zenith was adjusted using the following procedure . at each declination",
    "the average brightness temperature ratio between 22 mhz and 408 mhz was calculated ( using t - t plots ) over the range 8 to 16 hours in right ascension ( to exclude extended absorption regions on the galactic plane ) . the temperature scale at 22 mhz",
    "was then adjusted to make this ratio equal to that at the zenith ( note that fig .",
    "1 shows data over a wider range of right ascension ) .    in order to cover the central regions of the galaxy , we have included observations as far south as declination @xmath028 , where the telescope was operating at a zenith angle of 76.8 . at these large zenith angles ,",
    "there is some departure of the antenna gain function from its calculated value ( see costain et al .",
    "however , reliable flux densities of point sources have been obtained as far south as declination @xmath017.4(roger et al .",
    "@xcite ) and we believe that our calibration procedure remains reasonably effective to the southern limit of our map .",
    "figs .  2 to 6 show in equatorial coordinates a contoured gray - scale map of the 22 mhz emission from the sky between declinations @xmath028  and 80  in five segments .",
    "figs .  7 and 8 depict the data between galactic latitutes @xmath040  and @xmath140  with the same contours and grayscale in galactic coordinates , and with positions of extended galactic sources indicated .",
    "9 is a grayscale representation of the full data set in aitoff projection of galactic coordinates .",
    "the brightness temperature of the 22 mhz emission varies from @xmath217  kk towards a broad minimum about 50  off the galactic plane at the longitude of the anticentre to over 250  kk on the plane near the galactic centre .",
    "the brightness temperature near both north and south galactic poles is approximately 27  kk .",
    "the galactic plane itself is apparent over the full range of longitude from @xmath11  to @xmath1244 . at various points along the plane , particularly at lesser longitudes , depressions are apparent in the emission .",
    "these represent thermal free - free absorption of bright synchrotron background emission by relatively nearby , opaque regions of dense ionized gas .",
    "we emphasize that the main value of the data lies in the representation of structure larger than the beam .",
    "the strongest point sources ( cas a , cyg a , tau a and vir a ) have been removed from the map . while other point sources remain in the maps , these data can not be used to determine their flux densities .",
    "first , the ionospheric effects mentioned above cause the point sources to be very poorly represented in these maps .",
    "second , the scaling applied after comparison with the 408 mhz data will have further affected the flux densities of point sources at declinations away from the zenith .",
    "reliable point source flux densities are already available in the published lists referred to in section 1 .      a number of extended supernova remnants are apparent in the data and the positions of these are indicated with labels in figs .",
    "the flux densities of most of the snrs have been previously measured from the original observations and published in various papers .",
    "we have collected these and listed them in table 1 together with new flux densities for two additional remnants not previously reported .",
    "one other snr , hb21 , is indicated in fig .",

    "six regions are at distances from 400900 pc and the values of 22 mhz emissivity is equal to 4.93@xmath410@xmath16wm@xmath8hz@xmath9sr@xmath9 at 22 mhz ] range from 21  kpc@xmath9 to 60  kpc@xmath9 with a mean of 40.1  kpc@xmath9 . excluding two regions , sh220 and sh264 , which are more than 10   off the plane , but including ic1805 , at a distance of 2.2 kpc , we find a mean emissivity of 30.2  kpc @xmath9 with an _ rms _ of 9.6  kpc@xmath9 .",
    "these emissivities are comparable with similarly derived emissivities tabulated ( at 10mhz ) by rockstroh & webber ( @xcite ) . in addition",
    ", our value in the direction of ic1805 , 20.9  kpc@xmath9 , is close to the value of 18  kpc@xmath9 obtained by roger ( @xcite ) using a detailed modelling of 22 and 38 mhz data for the ic1805ic1848 complex .    however , there is a problem reconciling a mean value of local emissivity of 30  kpc@xmath9 with the model of galactic emission of beuermann et al .",

    "@xcite ) and divide by the model s half  equivalent  width of 1.8  kpc , we derive a mid - plane emissivity of only 11.7  kpc@xmath9 , almost a factor of 3 less than our measured mean value . to reconcile our measurement with the model",
    ", one or more of the following must apply : _",
    "( i ) _ our measured local mean emissivity is greater than the typical value at the solar radius ; _ ( ii ) _ the equivalent width of the `` thick  disk '' component is locally less than the model predicts ; _ ( iii ) _ the extragalactic component of the polar emission is less than is estimated from extrapolations of extragalactic source counts at higher frequencies ; and/or _ ( iv ) _ a zero  level correction should be added to the 22 mhz brightness temperatures . with regard to the extragalactic component of emission , we note that estimates are usually derived from source count ( `` log n  log s '' ) analyses at frequencies above 150  mhz ( e.g. lawson@xcite ) , extrapolated with an assumed spectral index @xmath172.75 .",
    "analyses of source counts at substantially lower frequencies are needed for accurate estimates of the extragalactic component .",
    "we noted in section 6.1 the possibility of a zero  level correction as indicated by t - t plot comparisons with 408  mhz data . in this regard ,",
    "it is interesting to note that very low resolution measurements with scaled antennas at several low frequencies ( bridle @xcite ) predicted a brightness temperature at 22 mhz in the area of the north galactic pole 4  kk higher than our value .",
