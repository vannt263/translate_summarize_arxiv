    "the seminal paper by vogel and risken @xcite on the tomographic reconstruction of wigner functions of light fields has greatly enhanced interest into the old problem of `` measurement '' of states of quantum - mechanical systems . within the last few years",
    "tomographic reconstruction has been experimentally realized for example by raymer and coworkers @xcite , and mlynek and coworkers @xcite .",
    "tomographic reconstruction schemes of states of other bosonic systems such as vibrational modes of trapped atoms @xcite and atomic waves @xcite have been proposed .",
    "recently wigner functions of vibration states of a trapped atom have been experimentally determined by wineland and coworkers @xcite , while kurtsiefer and coworkers @xcite have measured wigner functions of atomic wave packets .",
    "leonhardt @xcite has extended the ideas of vogel and risken to the case of wigner functions in discrete phase spaces associated with physical systems with finite - dimensional hilbert spaces , such as spin systems .",
    "the problem of reconstruction of states of finite - dimensional systems is closely related to various aspects of quantum information processing , such as reading of registers of quantum computers @xcite .",
    "this problem also emerges when states of atoms are reconstructed . in particular ,",
    "walser , cirac , and zoller @xcite have shown that under certain conditions quantum states of a single quantized cavity mode can be _ completely _ transferred on to the internal zeeman submanifold of an atom .",
    "consequently , the reconstruction of the states of a cavity mode is reduced to the problem of reconstruction of angular momentum states in a finite dimensional hilbert space .    from the postulates of quantum mechanics",
    "it follows that the _ complete _ reconstruction of a state of a quantum - mechanical system can be performed providing a complete set of system observables ( i.e. , the _ quorum _ @xcite ) is measured on the ensemble of identically prepared systems .",
    "this goal on one hand may be technically difficult to realize and on the other hand it may not be necessary . in many situations even partial knowledge ( i.e. , incomplete reconstruction ) of the state is sufficient for particular purposes .",
    "the complete reconstruction of spin states have been addressed in the literature @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we will analyze the problem of the partial reconstruction of these states .",
    "we will show how the spin state can be reconstructed when just a restricted set of mean values of the system observables is known from the measurement . utilizing the jaynes principle of _ maximum entropy",
    "_ we will partially reconstruct the density operator from the available ( i.e. , measured ) mean values of system observables .",
    "we will also address the question as to which is the minimum observation level ( i.e. , a specific subset of system observables ) on which the complete reconstruction can be performed .",
    "in particular , we will analyze the reconstruction of the most correlated states of the system composed of two and three spins-1/2 ( i.e. , the bell and the greenberger  horne ",
    "zeilinger states ) .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly review the principle of maximum entropy and the formalism of state reconstruction associated with particular observation levels . in section",
    "iii we present a simple illustration of a reconstruction of a state of a single spin-1/2 .",
    "section iv will be devoted to the detailed analysis of the state reconstruction for a system of two correlated spins-1/2 . in section",
    "v we will address the problem of the ( partial ) reconstruction of the greenberger  horne  zeilinger states . in appendix a we present detailed reconstruction of density operators on two nontrivial observation levels .",
    "when it is _ a priori _ known that experimental data contain the complete information about the state of the system , then it is just a question of technical convenience how to perform a transformation of this data into a more familiar object such a density operator .",
    "a particular example of this procedure is quantum homodyne tomography @xcite when from the measured probability distributions of rotated quadratures one can reconstruct ( with the help of the inverse radon transformation ) the wigner function of the state .",
    "now we can ask the question : `` what is the density operator of the quantum mechanical system when an _ incomplete _ measurement over this system is performed ? '' . in this case the experimental data does not provide us with sufficient information to specify the density operator of the system uniquely , i.e. there can be many density operators which fulfill the constraints imposed by incomplete experimental data . in this situation",
    "one can only _ estimate _ what is the most probable density operator which describes the system .    in principle",
    "we can distinguish two different forms of incompleteness : firstly , when a _ precise _ knowledge of a _ subset _ of the quorum @xcite of system observables is known ; secondly , when system observables are not measured precisely , i.e. , instead of probability distributions only frequencies of appearances of eigenvalues of these observables are available .    in the present paper",
    "we will focus our attention on the reconstruction of density operators of spin states when mean values of a subset of system observables are measured precisely . in this case",
    "the estimation of density operators can be performed with the help of jaynes principle of maximum entropy .",
    "let us assume that the state of a spin system , described by the density operator @xmath0 , is unknown and only expectation values @xmath1 of observables @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) are available from a measurement .",
    "the set of observables is referred to as the _ observation level _ @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "there can be a large number of density operators @xmath5 which are in agreement with the experimental results , i.e. , ( _ ) = g_(= 1,  ,n ) [ 1.1 ] .if we wish to use only the expectation values @xmath1 of the chosen observation level for an estimation ( reconstruction ) of the density operator , then we face the problem of selecting one particular density operator@xmath6 out of many @xmath5 which fulfill condition ( [ 1.1 ] ) . to perform this `` selection '' ( i.e. , estimation )",
    "we note that the density operators under consideration do differ by their degree of deviation from pure states .",
    "to quantify this deviation an uncertainty measure has to be introduced .",
    "following jaynes @xcite one can utilize the von neumann entropy @xcite s[]=- ( ) .[1.3 ] for pure states @xmath7 while for statistical mixtures of pure states @xmath8 .    according to the jaynes principle of maximum entropy",
    ", we have to choose from a set of density operators @xmath5 which fulfill the constraints of eq.([1.1 ] ) the generalized canonical density operator @xmath9 which maximizes the value of the von neumann entropy ) .",
    "for example , by maximizing the linearized entropy @xcite = 1- ( ^2 ) one can obtain a _ partially _ reconstructed density operator @xmath10 which fulfills conditions ( [ 1.1 ] ) and simultaneously leads to the `` maximum mixture '' , i.e. , @xmath11=\\max$ ] .",
    "note that for pure states @xmath12 while for mixtures @xmath13 . on the complete observation level , this `` maximum - mixture '' principle is equivalent to the maximum - entropy principle but , in general , on the reduced ( incomplete ) observation levels , @xmath14 . ] .",
    "in other words , the maximum - entropy principle is _ the most conservative _ assignment , in the sense that it does not permit one to draw any conclusions unwarranted by the measured data .",
    "the generalized canonical density operator @xmath9 represents a _ partially _ reconstructed ( estimated ) density operator on the given observation level @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding entropy @xmath15 $ ] represents the measure of deviation of the reconstructed state from an original pure state .",
    "the generalized canonical density operator @xmath9 takes the form @xcite _",
    "o&=&1 z_o ( - _ _ _ ) , [ 1.4 ] + z_o&= & where @xmath16 is the generalized partition function ; @xmath17 are the lagrange multipliers which have to be found from the set of equations ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "any incomplete observation level @xmath18 can be extended to a more complete observation level @xmath19 which includes additional observables , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "additional expectation values can only increase the amount of available information about the state of the system .",
    "this procedure is called the _ extension _ of the observation level ( from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ) and is usually associated with a decrease of the entropy , as @xmath21 .",
    "we can also consider a _ reduction _ of the observation level if we decrease number of independent observables which are measured .",
    "this reduction is accompanied with an increase of the entropy due to the decrease of information available about the state of the system .",
    "each incomplete observation level can be considered as a reduction of the complete observation level . in what follows",
    "we will study a sequence of observation levels in the form    ccccccccc o_a & & o_b & & o_c & &  & & o_comp + s_a & & s_b & & s_c & &  & & 0     [ 1.5 ] which represent successive extensions of an observation level @xmath18 towards the complete observation level @xmath22 .    concluding this section we make two remarks .",
    "firstly we stress that the reconstruction scheme based on the jaynes principle of maximum entropy does not require any a priori assumption about the purity of reconstructed states , i.e. , it can be applied for reconstruction of pure states as well as for statistical mixtures .",
    "this reconstruction scheme is equivalent to an averaging over the generalized grand canonical ensemble of _ all _ states of the system , under the conditions imposed by the constraints given by eq.([1.1 ] ) . within the framework of a geometrical formalism , each state of the quantum system",
    "is represented by a point in the parametric state space .",
    "those states which fulfils the constraints ( [ 1.1 ] ) are represented by a specific manifold in the parametric space . from the maxent principle",
    "it then follows that the generalized canonical density operator is equal to the equally weighted average over all states on this specific manifold .",
    "obviously this average is represented by one special point which is associated with the generalized canonical density operator . in the case when there is no information available about the preparation of the system",
    ", then there is no intrinsic way to specify the `` minimal '' complete observation level . here by minimal we mean the complete observation level composed of the smallest number of observables .",
    "what one can do is to extend systematically observation levels and evaluate the von neumann entropy associated with reconstructed generalized canonical density operators .",
    "if at some stage of the extension of observation levels the von neumann entropy becomes zero , it then means that the given observation is complete and the pure state of the system is completely `` measured '' .",
    "obviously this does not mean that this observation level is the minimal one . in the case",
    "when the measured system is prepared in an unknown statistical mixture it is impossible to specify the minimal observation level prior the measurement on the complete observation level is performed . if this is done then by a sequence of reductions under the condition that the von neumann entropy is unchanged one can specify the minimal observation level .    in the following sections we will apply the jaynes principle for the reconstruction of pure spin states .",
    "firstly , for illustrative purposes we present the simple example of the reconstruction of states of a single spin-1/2 system with the help of the maximum - entropy principle . then we will discuss the partial reconstruction of entangled spin states .",
    "in particular , we will analyze the problem how to identify incomplete observation levels on which the complete reconstruction can be performed for the bell and the greenberger ",
    "zeilinger states ( i.e. , the corresponding entropy is equal to zero and the generalized canonical density operator is identical to @xmath0 ) .",
    "firstly we illustrate the application of the maximum - entropy principle for the partial quantum  state reconstruction of single spin@xmath23 system .",
    "let us consider an ensemble of spins-@xmath23 in an unknown pure state @xmath24 .",
    "in the most general case this unknown state vector @xmath24 can be parameterized as |_0=    eigenstates of the @xmath25-component of the spin operator @xmath26 with eigenvalues @xmath27 , @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding density operator @xmath29 can be written in the form _",
    "0= 12 ( + . ) [ 2.1b ] where @xmath30 is the unity operator , @xmath31 ; @xmath32 are the pauli spin operators which in the matrix representation in the basis @xmath33 , @xmath34 read _",
    "x= (    cc 0 & 1 + 1 & 0    ) , _ y= (    cc 0 & -i + i & 0    ) , _",
    "z= (    cc 1 & 0 + 0 & -1    ) .[2.1c ]    to determine completely the unknown state one has to measure three linearly independent ( e.g. , orthogonal ) projections of the spin .",
    "after the measurement of the expectation value of each observable , a reconstruction of the generalized canonical density operator ( [ 1.4 ] ) according to the maximum - entropy principle can be performed . in table  1",
    "we consider three observation levels defined as @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 [ the superscript of the observation levels indicates the number of spins@xmath23 under consideration ] .    using algebraic properties of the @xmath38-operators , the generalized canonical density operator ( [ 1.4 ] )",
    "can be expressed as _",
    "o=1z ( -.)=1z , z=2 || [ 2.2 ] with @xmath39 and @xmath40 . the final form of the @xmath9 on particular observation levels is given in table  1 .",
    "the corresponding entropies can be written as s_o",
    "=- p_o p_o - ( 1-p_o ) ( 1-p_o ) where @xmath41 is one eigenvalue of @xmath9 [ the other eigenvalue is equal to @xmath42 which reads as p_a=1+|_z| 2 , p_b=1 + 2 , p_comp=1 + 2 .it is seen that the entropy @xmath43 is equal to zero if and only if @xmath44 . from here",
    "follows that on @xmath45 only the basis vectors @xmath33 and @xmath34 with @xmath46 can be fully reconstructed .",
    "nontrivial is @xmath47 , on which a whole set of pure states ( [ 2.1 ] ) with @xmath48 ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) can be uniquely determined . for such states @xmath50 and further measurement of the @xmath51 on @xmath52 represents redundant ( useless ) information .",
    "now we assume a system composed of two _ distinguishable _ spins@xmath23 .",
    "if we are performing only _ local _ measurements of observables such as @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( here superscripts label the particles ) which do not reflect correlations between the particles then the reconstruction of the density operator reduces to an estimation of individual ( uncorrelated ) spins1/2 , i.e. , the reconstruction reduces to the problem discussed in the previous section . for each spin@xmath23",
    "the reconstruction can be performed separately and the resulting generalized canonical density operator is given as a tensor product of particular generalized canonical density operators , i.e. , @xmath55 . in this case",
    "just the uncorrelated states @xmath56 can be fully reconstructed .",
    "nevertheless , the correlated ( nonfactorable ) states @xmath57 are of central interest .    in general ,",
    "any density operator of a system composed of two distinguishable spins@xmath23 can be represented by a @xmath58 hermitian matrix and @xmath59 independent numbers are required for its complete determination .",
    "it is worth noticing that @xmath59 operators ( observables ) \\",

    "reconstruct an unknown density operator @xmath0 on various observation levels .",
    "conceptually the method of maximum entropy is rather straightforward : one has to express the generalized canonical density operator ( [ 1.4 ] ) for two spins-1/2 in the form ( [ 3.2 ] ) from which a set of nonlinear equations for langrange multipliers @xmath17 is obtained .",
    "due to algebraic properties of the operators under the consideration the practical realization of this programme can be technically difficult ( see appendix a ) .",
    "in table  2 we define some nontrivial observation levels . measured",
    "observables which define a particular observation level are indicated in table  2 by bullets ( @xmath63 ) while the empty circles ( @xmath64 ) indicate unmeasured observables ( i.e. , these observables are not included in the given observation level ) for which the maximum - entropy principle `` predicts '' nonzero mean values .",
    "this means that the maximum - entropy principle provide us with a nontrivial estimation of mean values of unmeasured observables .",
    "the generalized canonical density operators which correspond to the observation levels considered in table  2 are presented in table  3 .",
    "the signs `` @xmath65 '' are used to indicate unmeasured observables for which nontrivial information can be obtained with the help of the maximum - entropy principle .      in what follows",
    "we analyze a partial reconstruction of the bell states ( i.e. , the most correlated two particle states ) on observation levels given in table  2 .",
    "one of our main tasks will be to find the minimum observation level ( i.e. , the set of system observables ) on which the complete reconstruction of these states can be performed . obviously , if all 15 observables are measured , then any state of two spins-1/2 can be reconstructed precisely .",
    "nevertheless , due to the quantum entanglement between the two particles , measurements of some observables will simply be redundant . to find the minimal set of observables which uniquely determine the bell state one has to perform either a sequence of reductions of the complete observation level , or a systematic extension of the most trivial observation level @xmath66 .",
    "let us consider particular examples of bell states , of the form |_^",

    "^(bell ) = |_^ ( bell)_^ ( bell)| , [ 3.3 ] ( other bell states are discussed later ) .",
    "these maximally correlated states have the property that the result of a measurement performed on one of the two spins@xmath23 uniquely determines the state of the second spin .",
    "therefore , these states find their applications in quantum communication systems @xcite .",
    "in addition , they are suitable for testing fundamental principles of quantum mechanics @xcite such as the complementarity principle or local hidden ",
    "variable theories @xcite .",

    "further extension to the observation level on @xmath70 corresponds to a rotation of the stern ",

    "the observation level @xmath72 is associated with another rotation of the stern ",

    "the generalized canonical density operators on the observation levels @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath72 predict zero mean values for all the unmeasured observables ( [ 3.1 ] ) ( see table  3 ) .    in general , successive extensions ( [ 3.4 ] ) of the observation level @xmath67",
    "should be accompanied by a decrease in the entropy of the reconstructed state which should reflect increase of our knowledge about the quantum - mechanical system under consideration .",
    "nevertheless , we note that there are states for which the entropy remains constant when @xmath69 is extended towards @xmath70 and @xmath72 , i.e. , the performed measurements are in fact redundant .",
    "for instance , this is the case for the maximally correlated state ( [ 3.3 ] ) . here",
    "entropies associated with given observation levels read s_a=22 , s_b = s_c = s_d=2 , respectively , which mean that these observation levels are not suitable for reconstruction of the bell states .",
    "the reason is that the bell states have no `` preferable '' direction for each individual spin , i.e. , @xmath74 for @xmath75 and @xmath76 .    from the above it follows that , for a nontrivial reconstruction of bell states , the observables which reflect correlations between composite spins also have to be included into the observation level .",

    "the coefficient @xmath105 in front of @xmath103 can either be found explicitly in a closed analytical form ( see appendix a ) or can be obtained from the following variational problem .",
    "namely , we remind ourselves that the expression ( [ 1.4 ] ) for @xmath104 helps us to identify those unmeasured observables for which the jaynes principle of the maximum entropy `` predicts '' nonzero mean values . at this stage",
    "we still have to find the particular value of the parameter @xmath105 for which the density operator @xmath104 in table  3 leads to the maximum of the von neumann entropy . to do so we search through the one - dimensional parametric space which is bounded as @xmath106 .",
    "to be specific , first of all , for @xmath107 we have to exclude those operators which are not true density operators ( i.e. , any such operators which have negative eigenvalues ) .",

    "up from a physical parametric subspace the generalized canonical density operator with the maximum von neumann entropy .",
