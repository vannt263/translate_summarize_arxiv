    "the search for a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , and in particular for a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson , has been a major goal of particle physics for many years , and is a central part of the fermilab tevatron physics program .",
    "both the cdf and collaborations have performed new combinations  @xcite of multiple direct searches for the sm higgs boson .",
    "the new searches include more data , additional channels , and improved analysis techniques compared to previous analyses .",
    "the sensitivities of these new combinations significantly exceed those of previous combinations  @xcite .    in this note , we combine the most recent results of all such searches in  collisions at  .",
    "the analyses combined here seek signals of higgs bosons produced in association with a vector boson ( @xmath9 ) , through gluon - gluon fusion ( @xmath10 ) , and through vector boson fusion ( vbf ) ( @xmath11 ) corresponding to integrated luminosities up to 8.2  at cdf and up to 8.6  at d0 .",
    "the higgs boson decay modes studied are @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    to simplify the combination , the searches are separated into 165 mutually exclusive final states ( 71 for cdf and 94 for d0 ; see tables  [ tab : cdfacc ] and  [ tab : dzacc ] ) referred to as `` analysis sub - channels '' in this note .",
    "the selection procedures for each analysis are detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite through  @xcite , and are briefly described below .",
    "event selections are similar for the corresponding cdf and d0 analyses , consisting typically of a preselection followed by the use of a multivariate analysis technique with a final discriminating variable to separate signal and background . for the case of ,",
    "an isolated lepton ( @xmath17 electron or muon ) and two or three jets required , with one or more @xmath18-tagged jets , i.e. , identified as containing a weakly - decaying @xmath18 hadron .",
    "selected events must also display a significant imbalance in transverse momentum ( referred to as missing transverse energy or ) .",
    "events with more than one isolated lepton are rejected .    for the d0  analyses ,",
    "the data are split by lepton type and jet multiplicity ( two or three jet sub - channels ) , and whether there are one or two @xmath18-tagged jets . as with other d0 analyses targeting the  decay ,",
    "the  analyses use a new boosted decision tree based @xmath18-tagging algorithm for this combination .",
    "the new algorithm is an upgraded version of the neural network @xmath18-tagger used previously  @xcite , and includes more information relating to the lifetime of the jet and results in a better discrimination between @xmath18 and light jets . unlike previous versions of the analysis the same `` loose '' @xmath18-tagging criterion",
    "is applied to both the single ( lst ) and double ( ldt ) tag samples , with the output of the @xmath18-tagger now being used as an input to the final discriminant .",
    "this loose @xmath18-tagging criterion corresponds to an identification efficiency of @xmath19 for true @xmath18-jets for a mis - identification rate of @xmath20 .",
    "each sub - channel is analyzed separately .",
    "the outputs of boosted decision trees , trained separately for each sample and for each higgs boson mass , are used as the final discriminating variables in the limit setting procedure .",
    "in addition for this combination d0 now uses 8.5 fb@xmath21 of data .    for the cdf  analyses ,",
    "events are analyzed in two and three jet sub - channels separately , and in each of these samples the events are grouped into various lepton and @xmath18-tag categories .",
    "events are broken into separate analysis categories based on the quality of the identified lepton .",
    "separate categories are used for events with a high quality muon or central electron candidate , an isolated track or identified loose muon in the extended muon coverage , a forward electron candidate , and a loose central electron or isolated track candidate .",
    "the final two lepton categories , which provide some acceptance for lower quality electrons and single prong tau decays , are used only in the case of two - jet events . within the lepton categories",
    "there are four @xmath18-tagging categories considered for two - jet events : two tight @xmath18-tags ( tdt ) , one tight @xmath18-tag and one loose @xmath18-tag ( ldt ) , one tight @xmath18-tag and one looser @xmath18-tag ( ldtx ) , and a single , tight , @xmath18-tag ( st ) . for three jet events",
    "there is no ldtx tagging category and the corresponding events are included within the st category . in the case of the two jet events , a bayesian neural network discriminant is trained at each higgs boson mass within the test range for each of the specific categories ( defined by lepton type , @xmath18-tagging type , and number of jets ) , while matrix element ( me ) discriminants are used for each three jet event category .    for the  analyses ,",
    "the selection is similar to the @xmath22 selection , except all events with isolated leptons are rejected and stronger multijet background suppression techniques are applied . both the cdf and d0 analyses use a track - based missing transverse momentum calculation as a discriminant against false .",
    "in addition both cdf and d0 utilize multi - variate techniques , a boosted decision tree at d0 and a neural network at cdf , to further discriminate against the multijet background before @xmath18-tagging .",
    "there is a sizable fraction of the  signal in which the lepton is undetected that is selected in the  samples , so these analyses are also referred to as @xmath23 .",
    "the cdf analysis uses three non - overlapping categories of @xmath18-tagged events ( tdt , ldt and st ) d0 uses the same loose single ( lst ) and double tag ( ldt ) criteria as the  analyses , with the output of the @xmath18-tagger again being used as an input to the final discriminant .",
    "cdf uses neural - network outputs for the final discriminating variables , while d0 uses boosted decision tree outputs . for this combination d0",
    "has analysed the 2-jet sample in an exclusive manner , updating both the 1- and 2 @xmath18-tag samples to use 8.4 fb@xmath21 of data .",
    "the exclusive 3-jet sample is currently not included .",
    "the  analyses require two isolated leptons and at least two jets .",
    "d0 s  analyses separate events into non - overlapping samples of events with either one tight @xmath18-tag ( tst ) or both one tight and one loose @xmath18-tags ( tldt ) .",
    "cdf separates events into single tag ( st ) , double tag ( tdt ) and loose double tag ( ldt ) samples .",
    "to increase signal acceptance d0 loosens the selection criteria for one of the leptons to include an isolated track not reconstructed in the muon detector ( @xmath24 ) or an electron from the inter - cryostat region of the d0 detector ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "combined with the dielectron ( @xmath26 ) and dimuon ( @xmath27 ) analyses , these provide four orthogonal analyses , and each uses 8.6 fb@xmath21 of data in this combination .",
    "cdf uses neural networks to select loose dielectron and dimuon candidates .",
    "d0 applies a kinematic fit to optimize reconstruction , while cdf corrects jet energies for  using a neural network approach .",
    "d0 uses random forests of decision trees to provide the final variables for setting limits .",
    "cdf utilizes a multi - layer discriminant based on neural networks where two discriminant functions are used to define three separate regions of the final discriminant function .    for the  analyses ,",
    "signal events are characterized by large  and two opposite - signed , isolated leptons .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents the accurate reconstruction of the candidate higgs boson mass .",
    "d0 selects events containing electrons and/or muons , dividing the data sample into three final states : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "each final state is further subdivided according to the number of jets in the event : 0 , 1 , or 2 or more ( `` 2 + '' ) jets .",
    "each of the three final states each uses 8.1 fb@xmath21 of data .",
    "decays involving tau leptons are included in two orthogonal ways . a dedicated analysis ( @xmath31 ) using 7.3 fb@xmath21 of data studying the final state involving a muon and a hadronic tau decay",
    "is included in the tevatron combination .",
    "final states involving other tau decays and mis - identified hadronic tau decays are included in the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 final state analyses .",
    "cdf separates the  events in five non - overlapping samples , split into `` high @xmath32 '' and `` low @xmath32 '' categories defined by lepton types and the number of reconstructed jets : 0 , 1 , or 2 + jets . the sample with two or more jets is not split into low @xmath32 and high @xmath32 lepton categories due to the smaller statistics in this channel .",
    "a sixth cdf channel is the low dilepton mass ( @xmath33 ) channel , which accepts events with @xmath34  gev .",
    "a new improvement of the cdf analysis is the ability to recover events with lepton pairs that lie within each other s isolation cones .",
    "this improvement leads to a significant increase in sensitivity from the low @xmath33 channel , in particular .",
    "the division of events into categories based on the number of reconstructed jets allows the analysis discriminants to separate differing contributions of signal and background processes more effectively .",
    "the signal production mechanisms considered are @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and vector - boson fusion .",
    "the relative fractions of the contributions from each of the three signal processes and background processes , notably @xmath37 production and @xmath38 production , are very different in the different jet categories .",
    "dividing our data into these categories provides more statistical discrimination , but introduces the need to evaluate the systematic uncertainties carefully in each jet category .",
    "a discussion of these uncertainties is found in section  [ sec : signal ] .",
    "the d0 @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 final state channels use boosted decision tree outputs as the final discriminants while the @xmath31 channel uses neural networks .",
    "cdf uses neural - network outputs , including likelihoods constructed from calculated matrix - element probabilities as additional inputs for the 0-jet bin .",
    "d0 includes  analyses in which the associated vector boson and the @xmath39 boson from the higgs boson decay are required to decay leptonically , with like - sign leptons present , thereby defining three like - sign dilepton final states ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 ) .",
    "the combined output of two decision trees , trained against the instrumental and diboson backgrounds respectively , is used as the final discriminant .",
    "cdf also includes a separate analysis of events with same - sign leptons to incorporate additional potential signal from associated production events in which the two leptons ( one from the associated vector boson and one from a @xmath39 boson produced in the higgs boson decay ) have the same charge .",
    "cdf additionally incorporates three tri - lepton channels to include additional associated production contributions in which leptons result from the associated @xmath39 boson and the two @xmath39 bosons produced in the higgs boson decay or where an associated @xmath43 boson decays into a dilepton pair and a third lepton is produced in the decay of either of the @xmath39 bosons resulting from the higgs boson decay . in the latter case , cdf separates the sample into one jet and two or more jet sub - channels to take advantage of the fact that the higgs boson candidate mass can be reconstructed from the invariant mass of the two jets , the lepton , and the missing transverse energy .    for the first time cdf",
    "includes a search for @xmath44 using four lepton events .",
    "a simple four - lepton invariant mass discriminant is used to separate potential higgs boson signal events from the non - resonant @xmath45 background .",
    "cdf has also updated its opposite - sign channels in which one of the two lepton candidates is a hadronic tau .",
    "events are separated into @xmath46-@xmath47 and @xmath48-@xmath47 channels .",
    "the final discriminants are obtained from boosted decision trees which incorporate both hadronic tau identification and kinematic event variables as inputs .",
    "d0 also includes channels in which one of the @xmath39 bosons in the @xmath49 process decays leptonically and the other decays hadronically .",
    "electron and muon final states are studied separately , each with 5.3 fb@xmath21 of data .",
    "random forests are used for the final discriminants .",
    "cdf includes an updated , generic analysis searching for higgs bosons decaying to tau lepton pairs incorporating contributions from direct @xmath50 production , associated @xmath22 or @xmath51 production , and vector boson production .",
    "cdf also includes for the first time an analysis of events that contain one reconstructed lepton ( @xmath52 = @xmath46 or @xmath48 ) in addition to a tau lepton pair focusing on associated production where @xmath53 and an additional lepton is produced in the decay of the @xmath39 or @xmath43 boson .",
    "for the generic search , events with either one or two jets are separated into two independent analysis channels .",
    "the final discriminant for setting limits is obtained using four boosted decision tree discriminants , each designed to discriminate the signal against one of the major backgrounds ( qcd multijets , @xmath39 plus jets , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 where @xmath56 or @xmath48 ) . in the new analysis events are separated into three tri - lepton categories ( @xmath46-@xmath48-@xmath57 , @xmath52-@xmath52-@xmath57 , and @xmath52-@xmath57-@xmath57 ) .",
    "the final discriminants are likelihoods based on support vector machine ( svm )  @xcite outputs obtained using separate trainings for the signal against each of the primary backgrounds ( @xmath43 plus jets , @xmath58 , and dibosons ) .",
    "the d0 @xmath59 analysis likewise includes direct @xmath50 production , associated @xmath22 or @xmath51 production , and vector boson production .",
    "decay of the higgs boson to both tau and @xmath39 boson pairs is considered . a final state consisting of one leptonic tau decay , one hadronic hadronic tau decay and two jets is required . both muonic and electronic",
    "sub - channels use 4.3 fb@xmath21 the output of boosted decision trees is used as the final discriminant .",
    "cdf incorporates an older all - hadronic analysis , which results in two @xmath18-tagging sub - channels ( tdt and ldt ) for both @xmath60 and vbf production to the @xmath61 final state .",
    "events with either four or five reconstructed jets are selected , and at least two must be @xmath18-tagged .",
    "the large qcd multijet backgrounds are modeled from the data by applying a measured mistag probability to the non @xmath18-tagged jets in events containing a single @xmath18-tag .",
    "neural network discriminants based on kinematic event variables including those designed to separate quark and gluon jets are used to obtain the final limits .",
    "d0 and cdf both contribute analyses searching for higgs bosons decaying into diphoton pairs .",
    "the cdf analysis looks for a signal peak in the diphoton invariant mass spectrum above the smooth background originating from standard qcd production .",
    "signal acceptance has been increased in the updated analysis by including forward ( plug ) calorimeter candidates as well as central photon conversion candidates .",
    "events are now separated into four independent analysis channels based on the photon candidates contained within the event : two central candidates ( cc ) , one central and one plug candidate ( cp ) , one central and one central conversion candidate ( cc - conv ) , or one plug and one central conversion candidate ( pc - conv ) . in the d0 analysis",
    "the contribution of jets misidentified as photons is reduced by combining information sensitive to differences in the energy deposition from these particles in the tracker , calorimeter and central preshower in a neural network .",
    "the output of boosted decision trees , rather than the diphoton invariant mass , is used as the final discriminating variable .",
    "the transverse energies of the leading two photons along with the azimuthal opening angle between them and the diphoton invariant mass and transverse momentum are used as input variables . a sizeable improvement in sensitivity ( @xmath62 ) beyond that achieved with the invariant mass is obtained .",
    "cdf for the first time includes three non - overlapping sets of analysis channels searching for the process @xmath63 .",
    "one set of channels selects events with a reconstructed lepton , large missing transverse energy , and four or five reconstructed jets .",
    "these events are further sub - divided into five @xmath18-tagging categories ( three tight @xmath18-tags ( ttt ) , two tight and one loose @xmath18-tags ( ttl ) , one tight and two loose @xmath18-tags ( tll ) , two tight @xmath18-tags ( tdt ) , and one tight and one loose @xmath18-tags ( ldt ) ) .",
    "ensembles of neural network discriminants trained at each mass point are used to set limits .",
    "a second set of channels selects events with no reconstructed lepton .",
    "these events are separated into two categories , one containing events with large missing transverse energy and five to nine reconstructed jets and another containing events with low missing transverse energy and seven to ten reconstructed jets .",
    "events in these two channels are required to have a minimum of two @xmath18-tagged jets based on a neural network tagging algorithm .",
    "events with three or more @xmath18-tags are analyzed in separate channels from those with exactly two tags .",
    "two stages of neural network discriminants are used ( the first to help reject large multijet backgrounds and the second to separate potential @xmath64 signal events from @xmath58 background events ) .    for both cdf and d0 , events from qcd multijet ( instrumental ) backgrounds",
    "are typically measured in independent data samples using several different methods . for cdf ,",
    "backgrounds from sm processes with electroweak gauge bosons or top quarks were generated using pythia  @xcite , alpgen  @xcite , mc@nlo  @xcite , and herwig  @xcite programs .",
    "for d0 , these backgrounds were generated using pythia , alpgen , and comphep  @xcite , with pythia providing parton - showering and hadronization for all the generators .",
    "these background processes were normalized using either experimental data or next - to - leading order calculations ( including mcfm  @xcite for the @xmath65 heavy flavor process ) .",

    "the @xmath10 production cross section we use is calculated at next - to - next - to leading order ( nnlo ) in qcd with a next - to - next - to leading log ( nnll ) resummation of soft gluons ; the calculation also includes two - loop electroweak effects and handling of the running @xmath18 quark mass  @xcite .",
    "the numerical values in table  [ tab : higgsxsec ] are updates  @xcite of these predictions with @xmath66 set to 173.1  gev/@xmath3  @xcite , and with a treatment of the massive top and bottom loop corrections up to next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) + next - to - leading - log ( nll ) accuracy .",

    "we use the prescription of the pdf4lhc working group for evaluating pdf uncertainties on the inclusive production cross section .",
    "qcd scale uncertainties that affect the cross section via their impacts on the pdfs are included as a correlated part of the total scale uncertainty .",
    "the remainder of the pdf uncertainty is treated as uncorrelated with the qcd scale uncertainty .    for analyses seeking @xmath10 production that divide events into categories based on the number of reconstructed jets , we employ a new approach for evaluating the impacts of the scale uncertainties .",
    "following the recommendations of ref .",
    "@xcite , we treat the qcd scale uncertainties obtained from the nnll inclusive  @xcite , nlo one or more jets  @xcite , and nlo two or more jets  @xcite cross section calculations as uncorrelated with one another .",
    "we then obtain qcd scale uncertainties for the exclusive @xmath69  jet , 1  jet , and 2  or more jet categories by propagating the uncertainties on the inclusive cross section predictions through the subtractions needed to predict the exclusive rates .",
    "for example , the @xmath0 + 0  jet cross section is obtained by subtracting the nlo @xmath70  or more jet cross section from the inclusive nnll+nnlo cross section .",
    "we now assign three separate , uncorrelated scale uncertainties which lead to correlated and anticorrelated uncertainty contributions between exclusive jet categories .",

    "the scale choice affects the @xmath71 spectrum of the higgs boson when produced in gluon - gluon fusion , and this effect changes the acceptance of the selection requirements and also the shapes of the distributions of the final discriminants . the effect of the acceptance change is included in the calculations of ref .",

    "is provided by the lo generator pythia  @xcite which includes a parton shower and fragmentation and hadronization models .",
    "we reweight the higgs boson @xmath71 spectra in our pythia monte carlo samples to that predicted by hqt  @xcite when making predictions of differential distributions of @xmath10 signal events . to evaluate the impact of the scale uncertainty on our differential spectra",
    ", we use the resbos  @xcite generator , and apply the scale - dependent differences in the higgs boson @xmath71 spectrum to the hqt prediction , and propagate these to our final discriminants as a systematic uncertainty on the shape , which is included in the calculation of the limits .",
    "we include all significant higgs boson production modes in the high - mass search .",
    "besides gluon - gluon fusion through virtual quark loops ( ggh ) , we include higgs boson production in association with a @xmath39 or @xmath43 vector boson ( vh ) , and vector boson fusion ( vbf ) .",
