    "of the size @xmath0 of an air shower against its energy @xmath1 ( thick solid line ) , together with a low energy cut at @xmath2 . measured estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath0 fluctuate around the true values and spread events from an ideal point on the calibration curve ( black dots ) outwards into an uncertainty ellipse .",
    "the line density of events on the ellipse is constant .",
    "events that migrate below the cut are discarded ( dotted arc ) .",
    "surviving events ( thin solid arc ) spread more often below the ideal calibration curve since the arc is longer .",
    "a least - squares fit wrongly compensates this by placing the calibration curve below the true curve . ]    the latest generation of air - shower detectors , the pierre auger observatory  @xcite and telescope array  @xcite , are hybrid instruments .",
    "they combine a fluorescence detector which measures the calorimetric energy of an air shower with a low duty cycle , and a surface detector array measuring its size at ground with a full duty cycle .",
    "the size of an air shower measured at the same point in its longitudinal development is proportional to a power of its energy  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a calibration function returning an energy estimate for a measured size can be found by analyzing a subset of coincident events recorded in both detectors .",
    "fitting the calibration function to pairs of energy and size estimates with a plain least - squares method yields biased results for several reasons .",
    "firstly , the least - squares approach requires the true energy of the air shower to be known event - by - event , but the fluorescence detector only provides an energy estimate that fluctuates around the true energy .",
    "secondly , the energy spectrum of cosmic rays is very steep so that most of the data is located near the lower energy threshold of the detector .    in the threshold region ,",
    "the detector triggers are not fully efficient .",
    "upward fluctuations have a higher chance of passing the trigger and entering the data set than downward fluctuations .",
    "this creates an acceptance bias , so that the mean size of the accepted events does not reflect the true mean size of the original sample .",
    "applying an energy cut with a minimum energy high enough to avoid the threshold region altogether solves this problem , but it creates a new bias , caused by event migration over the new threshold introduced by the cut .",
    "how the bias appears is illustrated in fig.[fig : fig0 ] .",
    "a superficial solution is to use a slanted cut , but determining the angle under realistic conditions , where the resolutions vary with energy and size of the air shower , requires monte - carlo simulation of the data  @xcite .",
    "we will show that a probabilistic approach solves the problem in a consistent way .",
    "based on the known properties of air - shower development and the detectors , we construct a probability density model for the experimental data . maximizing the likelihood of the data under this model then yields an asymptotically unbiased estimate of the calibration curve .",
    "we use the variable @xmath0 for the size of the air shower at the ground , where it is observed by surface detector arrays .",
    "the size @xmath0 depends on the energy @xmath1 of the air shower , mass @xmath3 , and geometry @xmath4 .",
    "we use air - shower geometry as a summary term for the orientation and impact point of the air - shower axis .",
    "the size @xmath0 is often obtained by fitting an empirical lateral distribution function to the ground signals  @xcite , but other proxies work as well , such as the inferred total number of muons at ground in very inclined showers  @xcite .    air showers with the same geometry @xmath4 and energy @xmath1 show a fluctuating size @xmath0 at the ground .",
    "these fluctuations  @xcite are caused by random outcomes of the first few interactions of the air - shower development and possibly from sampling a random mass @xmath3 from the mass - distribution of cosmic rays .",
    "the mass @xmath3 is usually not exactly known event - by - event and therefore the dependency @xmath5 adds to the observed fluctuations of @xmath0 .",
    "we call these fluctuations combined _ intrinsic fluctuations_.    our aim is to find the function that yields the mean size @xmath6 of the air shower , averaged over intrinsic fluctuations , as a function of its energy @xmath1 and geometry @xmath4 . the energy dependence is usually modeled well by a power law @xmath7",
    ". our approach does not depend on the exact relationship and therefore we will just refer to @xmath8 as the parameter vector of the function @xmath9 .",
    "we mention the dependence of @xmath6 on the full air - shower geometry @xmath4 to treat the most general case . in practice ,",
    "the dependency on @xmath4 is usually corrected before applying the energy calibration .",
    "the correction is either based on air - shower simulations  @xcite , or inferred from data , by demanding that the flux of cosmic rays looks isotropic in the corrected size  @xcite .",
    "the inverse of @xmath10 serves as the energy calibration function , which provides an energy estimate @xmath11 based on a size @xmath0 of the air shower .",
    "care must be taken , however , since the random fluctuations of the observed size propagate into the energy estimate .",
    "analyses based on @xmath11 need to take into account , that @xmath11 randomly fluctuates around the true energy @xmath1 event - by - event , combined with the fact that true energies follow a very steeply falling distribution .",
    "this makes it more likely that a particular observed value of @xmath11 was generated by an upward fluctuation of an air - shower of lower energy , than by one with the same or higher energy .",
    "if the distribution of energies @xmath1 is to be measured based on @xmath11  @xcite , unfolding methods can be used  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the effects discussed before , detectors do not measure the energy @xmath1 , size @xmath0 , and geometry @xmath4 of the air shower directly .",
    "they provide estimates @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , that randomly fluctuate around the true values .",
    "these fluctuations are caused by statistical sampling of air - shower particles in the detector and by variations in the detector response .",
    "an experiment therefore provides a sample of tuples @xmath15 as input for the analysis .",
    "we assume that an energy cut @xmath16 is applied to this set which discards events with poor resolution in the threshold region of the detector .    to distinguish between functions and probability density functions ( pdfs ) in this article",
    ", we use the semi - colon in pdfsto separate the random variables from the dependent variables . for example",
    ", @xmath17 is the probability density function @xmath18 of the random variable @xmath19 , whose location and shape depends on @xmath20 . when integrals over random variables appear , we will not explicitly indicate the limits , except if the integral does _ not _ cover the physical domain of the variable , for example , @xmath21 for @xmath1 and @xmath0",
    ".    we will refer to the normal distributions frequently , and therefore use the notation @xmath22 to indicate the density @xmath23 in a fully rigorous treatment , we would have to use the truncated normal distribution in most places , where the domain of the variable @xmath19 is not the full real line .",
    "we generally assume that the experimental conditions are such that @xmath24 , so that both distributions approach each other .",
    "our fitting method is based on the maximum - likelihood method  @xcite . for un - binned continuous data ,",
    "it states that an estimate of the parameter vector @xmath8 can be found by maximizing the joint pdf@xmath25 of the data under the model considered .",
    "we make a usual substitution and maximize @xmath26 instead of @xmath25 , @xmath27 which is equivalent but easier to handle . the density @xmath28 models the data distribution as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "we maximize this sum with standard numerical algorithms to get an estimate @xmath29 of @xmath8 .",
    "if the data density was very high , working with a histogram of the data would be more effective and the log - likelihood would take a different form .",
    "both approaches can also be combined , so that the former is used in high density regions to speed up the computation of the sum , an example of such a technique is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the maximum - likelihood approach has a useful property that we will exploit repeatedly . finding the maximum of @xmath26 to get",
    "the estimate @xmath29 only involves the first derivative @xmath30 .",
    "similarly , computing the uncertainty estimate of @xmath29 only involves the second derivative .",
    "therefore , any constant factors @xmath31 with @xmath32 , that appear in the evaluation of @xmath33 , can be dropped without changing these results , @xmath34 we will use this to avoid the explicit computation of such factors wherever possible .",
    "we now focus on the construction of @xmath35 .",
    "the size function @xmath36 of the air - shower is at the heart of this pdf , the crucial point is to model the random fluctuations of events around this mean .",
    "the pdf@xmath28 of the observed ensemble is constructed by folding several conditional pdfsthat model the individual sources of fluctuations with the pdf@xmath37 of the arrival frequencies of air showers at the combined aperture of the detectors .",
    "the pdf@xmath37 itself is obtained by normalizing the product of the cosmic - ray flux @xmath38 with the effective aperture @xmath39 of the combined detectors .",
    "the effective aperture can dependent on energy and mass of the cosmic ray .",
    "for example , a fluorescence telescope can see high - energy air showers from a greater distance , since they are brighter .",
    "we emphasize that for the energy calibration to work , any mass dependency in the effective aperture of the calibration data needs to be the same as in the final data set to be calibrated .",
    "we now introduce the fluctuations step - by - step .",
    "if the detectors were perfect and there were no intrinsic fluctuations , we would describe the data with distribution @xmath40 where the dirac @xmath41-distribution states that the observed values follow the function @xmath9 exactly . yet , certain pairs of @xmath6 and @xmath1 occur more frequently than others , due to the different arrival frequencies of air showers , quantified by @xmath42 .",
    "for a fixed geometry @xmath4 , eq . represents a line density embedded into the @xmath43 plane .",
    "it traces the function @xmath9 that we want to extract .    by modeling",
    "how events are randomly scattered away from the line density , we develop the connection between the function @xmath9 and the observed ensemble .",
    "intrinsic fluctuations are incorporated by replacing the @xmath41-distribution with a conditional pdf@xmath44 , obtaining @xmath45 the shape of the pdf@xmath44 itself can depend on the air - shower energy @xmath1 and the geometry @xmath4 .",
    "now we add fluctuations caused by the detectors , and regard event loss from online triggers and a minimum energy cut .",
    "these effects are modeled by another conditional probability density function , the detector kernel @xmath46 .",
    "we fold @xmath47 with the kernel and multiply the result with a heaviside function @xmath48 to model the effect of the applied energy cut .",
    "this yields our first main result @xmath49 we neglect here , that shower - to - shower fluctuations in the size @xmath0 may be accompanied by anti - correlated fluctuations in the energy estimate @xmath12 .",
    "the energy estimate @xmath12 is typically based on light generated primarily by the electromagnetic cascade .",
    "a fraction of the shower - to - shower fluctuations is caused by variations in the flow of cosmic - ray energy into the hadronic and electromagnetic cascade .",
    "the anti - correlations reflect the conservation of energy .",
    "anti - correlated fluctuations in the energy estimate are expected to be smaller than 4% above @xmath50ev , and decreasing at higher energies  @xcite .",
    "this is typically small compared to the energy resolution , and therefore not included in the model .",
    "apart from this simplification , eq . is a general statistical model of the calibration data .",
    "the detector kernel @xmath51 can be obtained from monte - carlo simulation or derived from an empirical model .",
    "the pdf@xmath44 needs to be estimated from air - shower simulations or fitted to the calibration data together with the function @xmath9 .    due to losses modeled by the heaviside function and the detector kernel ,",
    "@xmath52 is not normalized to unity .",
    "the maximum - likelihood method does not require @xmath52 to be normalized , if the normalization does not depend on the parameters @xmath8 that are optimized .",
    "otherwise , @xmath52 needs to be replaced by @xmath53 a numerical computation of the normalization is expensive and should be avoided .",
    "we will show how the computation can be neglected in good approximation if a sufficiently large value of @xmath54 is chosen in the next section .",
    "our approach in its general form is more complex than a plain least - squares fit of the data , but if it is a complete probabilistic model of the data , maximizing the likelihood of the data under the model is guaranteed to yield an asymptotically unbiased estimate of the calibration curve .",
    "in particular , the probabilistic model handles inefficiencies and event migration above the threshold defined by the energy cut @xmath54 , which can not be dealt with in the framework of least - squares fitting .    the general form of eq .",
    "is expensive to compute due to the many integrals .",
    "we will proceed to discuss valid approximations which greatly reduce the computational cost , up to a point of removing all integrals .",
    "we will illustrate these approximations along an fully fledged example : the application of the likelihood approach to the energy calibration in the pierre auger observatory .",
    "two variants of our approach have been used in recent analyses from the pierre auger observatory .",
    "the variants are obtained by approximating eq . in a controlled manner , which reduces it into a practical form .",
    "both variants have a few aspects in common .",
    "the auger surface detector array is sufficiently flat and regular , so that the dependence on the air - shower geometry @xmath4 reduces only to a dependence on the zenith angle @xmath55 .",
    "the remaining atmospheric attenuation is corrected either empirically by demanding flux isotropy  @xcite or based on air - shower simulations  @xcite .",
    "thus , in this case the refined size parameter @xmath0 depends only on the energy @xmath1 of the air - shower , and we have @xmath56      the detector kernel is factorized into two independent normal distributions for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and a @xmath41-distribution for @xmath57 , @xmath58 with @xmath59 using independent normal distributions for @xmath12 and @xmath13 is well motivated , since the measurements are practically independent .",
    "the measurements implicitly sum up many individual signals with near - normal distributions . due to the central - limit theorem",
    ", the resolutions turn gaussian .    using the @xmath41-distribution for @xmath57",
    "is an approximation that saves a numerical integration .",
    "the @xmath41-distribution is the limit of a normal distribution with vanishing width , so effectively this ansatz treats the measurement of @xmath55 as exact . for the pierre auger observatory",
    "this approximation is very good , since the angular resolution is high and the detector kernel is only a slowly varying function of @xmath55 .",
    "event losses in the detector are neglected .",
    "this can be made into a good approximation by choosing a sufficiently high value of the energy cut @xmath54 .",
    "the value of @xmath54 needs to be high enough so that all accepted events have 100% detection efficiency , and rejected events with a reasonable chance to migrate over the threshold still have efficiencies near 100% .    under these conditions , the normalization of eq .",
    "becomes independent of the choice of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , eq . can be used directly in the likelihood instead of eq .. we will drop the heaviside function @xmath60 from now on , since it is always one for the selected data and was only needed to compute the normalization in the general case .",
    "the pdf@xmath61 of the intrinsic fluctuations is modeled by a normal distribution @xmath62 in case of the pierre auger observatory , there is no indication that the shower - to - shower fluctuations depend on the air - shower geometry @xmath4 , so the dependency is dropped .",
    "the choice of a normal distribution is only empirically motivated , since the pdfis theoretically unknown .",
    "its shape depends on the unknown distribution of cosmic - ray masses . however , pure samples of simulated proton and iron air - showers show distributions close to normal  @xcite , and the model fits data from the pierre auger observatory well  @xcite .",
    "since both the detector - generated fluctuations @xmath63 and the intrinsic fluctuations @xmath64 are modeled by normal distributions , it is tempting to carry out the folding @xmath65 analytically , to save another numerical integration .",
    "unfortunately , the trivial solution that holds for two independent normal distributions @xmath66 does not work here , since the resolution @xmath67 of the detector depends on the random outcome @xmath0 from shower - to - shower fluctuations .",
    "the fluctuations are coupled .",
    "and normal approximation @xmath68 to the folding of two normal distributions @xmath69 and @xmath70 with @xmath71 . ]",
    "the difference between the normal approximation @xmath72 , obtained by replacing @xmath0 with @xmath6 in the computation of @xmath67 , and the exact solution @xmath73 is illustrated in fig.[fig : fig1 ] for realistic values of @xmath74 .",
    "the exact solution has a shape that resembles something between a normal and log - normal distribution , in agreement with early studies based on monte - carlo simulations of air showers  @xcite .",
    "the normal approximation @xmath72 is nevertheless acceptable for the estimation of @xmath75 , since @xmath72 and @xmath73 have the same expectation value , as pointed out in appendix  [ app : expectation ] .",
    "the maximum - likelihood estimator of the central value of @xmath72 is unbiased with respect to the expectation value , and therefore this approximation does not bias the fit of the size function @xmath75 .",
    "however , the approximation biases the estimate of the width @xmath76 of the intrinsic fluctuations .",
    "while this parameter is irrelevant for the energy calibration itself , it has to be fitted to data since its true value is unknown .",
    "the width is also of physical interest in its own , since it is sensitive to the cosmic - ray mass composition .",
    "the impact on @xmath76 is shown in section  [ sec : toymc ] .    by assembling all pieces together and carrying out the integration over @xmath55 ,",
    "we arrive at the following form @xmath77 this form is the common root of two variants which have been independently derived and used for different zenith angle ranges at the pierre auger observatory .",
    "both variants assume that the distribution of hybrid events @xmath78 factorizes , @xmath79 which follows if the effective aperture @xmath80 for hybrid events factorizes in these variables .",
    "this was found to hold in good approximation  @xcite .      in variant",
    "a , eq . is integrated over the estimated zenith angle @xmath57 , which effectively removes one dimension of the data from the likelihood and the inference .",
    "this variant has been used at the pierre auger observatory to calibrate air showers with zenith angles up to @xmath81  @xcite .",
    "the integration leads to an effective kernel on the right hand side of eq .",
    "@xmath82 which is again approximated by a normal distribution .",
    "this approximation is good where the zenith angle dependency of the detector kernel is weak .    the remaining partial distribution @xmath83 is approximated by a power law @xmath84 with an appropriate spectral index .",
    "we arrive at variant a , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is an effective resolution that includes shower - to - shower fluctuations , and @xmath87 is an unspecified normalization constant that does not depend on @xmath8 and is therefore irrelevant for the likelihood estimation .",
    "the log - likelihood function then is ( up to constants ) @xmath88 the integration over the true energy @xmath1 is carried out numerically for each observed tuple @xmath89 .      in variant b , the approximations after eq .",
    "take a different path .",
    "the zenith angle dependency is kept , and a bootstrap estimate is used to remove the last remaining integral .",
    "the result is a double sum , which is fast to compute for small to moderate data sets .",
    "variant b has been used to calibrate very inclined events with zenith angles beyond @xmath90  @xcite .",
    "we start by observing that the pdf@xmath83 of hybrid events is well approximated by the pdf@xmath91 in the range of interest , which describes the distribution of the observed energy estimates @xmath12 .",
    "both pdfsdiffer by an integration over the detector kernel @xmath92 of the energy measurement , @xmath93 the effect of the folding is small since the resolution of the energy measurement is about 10%  @xcite . in particular , in the region near @xmath54 and above , the pdfsdiffer mainly by a shift that can be absorbed into the normalization .    after establishing this",
    ", we can now estimate the pdf@xmath94 from the calibration data itself .",
    "this could be done with a kernel density estimate or another non - parametric density estimation method . since @xmath94 appears only inside an integral",
    ", we chose the even simpler bootstrap estimate  @xcite .",
    "the bootstrap estimate can be regarded as a kernel density estimate with a kernel of vanishing width .",
    "it is constructed as a sum of @xmath41-distributions positioned at the observed values @xmath95 , weighted by the inverse of the overall detection efficiency @xmath96 at this value , @xmath97 the sum over @xmath98 is independent of the sum in eq . and runs over all @xmath99 hybrid events , not only those above the cut value @xmath54 .",
    "bootstrap theory is not well known in physics , but its is an established branch of statistics .",

    "the bias is therefore a consequence of the normal approximation described in section [ sec : comb_fluc ] .    in a final test",
    ", we push the bootstrap estimate of @xmath91 in variant b to the extreme by generating another set of 1000 toy experiments with only 10 events above @xmath54 .",
    "again , we find only negligible bias in the parameters of the calibration curve .",
    "we presented a statistical model that describes data taken by a hybrid air - shower detector , consisting of a surface detector array , which measures a size of an air shower , and a fluorescence detector , which measures an energy estimator .",
    "we developed a maximum - likelihood approach based on the statistical model , which allows us to infer an asymptotically unbiased energy calibration curve for the size from coincident events observed in both detector parts .    since the general model is somewhat cumbersome to use , we derived two approximations . the approximations lead to handy formulas , without sacrificing accuracy or introducing significant bias .",
    "both approximations are used by the pierre auger observatory in different zenith angle ranges .",
    "we applied the more aggressive approximation to simulated toy experiments , to investigate the statistical performance .",
    "the results showed that the estimated calibration curves are not biased with respect to the true curve used in the generation of the toy data .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the very fruitful exchanges we had with all of our colleagues in the auger collaboration .",
    "the valuable discussions with michael unger need to be highlighted especially .",
