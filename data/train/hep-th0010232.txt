    "inflation @xcite in the very early universe seems the only natural explanation of many observed features of our universe , in particular the recent measurements of a doppler peak in the cosmic microwave background fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , while it provides an appealing explanation for several cosmological problems , it provokes the natural question of why the conditions were such as to start inflation in the first place .",
    "the new inflationary scenario @xcite was proposed primarily to overcome the problem of obtaining a natural exit from the inflationary era . in this model , the value of the scalar",
    "is supposed to be initially confined to zero by thermal effects . as the universe expands and cools",
    "these effects disappear , leaving the scalar field miraculously exposed on a mountain peak of the potential .",
    "if the low temperature potential is sufficiently flat near @xmath0 then slow roll inflation will occur , ending when the field reaches its true minimum @xmath1 .",
    "this scenario seems implausible because a high temperature would confine only the average or expectation value of the scalar to zero . rather than be supercooled to a state with @xmath2 locally",
    ", the field fluctuates and rapidly forms domains with @xmath3 near @xmath4 the dynamics of the phase transition is governed by the growth and coalescence of these domains and not by a classical roll down of the spatially averaged field @xmath3 @xcite . because this and other problems , new inflation was largely abandoned in favor of chaotic inflation @xcite in which it is just assumed that that the scalar field was initially displaced from the minimum of the potential .",
    "one attempt to explain these initial conditions for inflation in terms of quantum fluctuations of the scalar field seems to lead to eternal inflation at the planck scale @xcite , at which the theory breaks down .",
    "another attempt , using the hartle - hawking `` no boundary '' proposal @xcite , found that the most probable universes did not have enough inflation @xcite .",
    "no satisfactory answer to the question of why the scalar field was initially displaced from the minimum of its potential has been found .    in this paper",
    "we will reconsider an earlier model , in which inflation is driven by the trace anomaly of a large number of matter fields .",
    "the standard model of particle physics contains nearly a hundred fields .",
    "this is at least doubled if the standard model is embedded in a supersymmetric theory .",
    "therefore there were certainly a large number of matter fields present in the early universe , so the large @xmath5 approximation should hold in cosmology , even at the beginning of the universe . in the large @xmath5 approximation ,",
    "one performs the path integral over the matter fields in a given background to obtain an effective action that is a functional of the background metric : ( -w[*g * ] ) = d [ ] ( -s [ ; * g * ] ) .",
    "one then argues that the effect of gravitational fluctuations is small in comparison to the large number of matter fluctuations .",
    "thus one can neglect graviton loops , and look for a stationary point of the combined gravitational action and the effective action for the matter fields .",
    "this is equivalent to solving the einstein equations with the source being the expectation value of the matter energy momentum tensor : r_ij - r g_ij = 8 g t_ij , where t^ij = - .",
    "finally , one can calculate linearized metric fluctuations about this stationary point metric and check they are small .",
    "this is confirmed observationally by measurements of the cosmic microwave background , which indicate that the primordial metric fluctuations were of the order of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "matter fields might be expected to become effectively conformally invariant if their masses are negligible compared to the spacetime curvature .",
    "classical conformal invariance is broken at the quantum level @xcite ( see @xcite for reviews ) , leading to an anomalous trace for the energy - momentum tensor : g^ij t_ij 0 .",
    "this trace is entirely geometrical in origin and therefore independent of the quantum state . in a maximally symmetric spacetime",
    ", the symmetry of the vacuum implies that the expectation value of the energy momentum tensor can be expressed in terms of its trace 0| t_ij |0 = g_ij g^kl 0| t_kl |0 .",
    "thus the trace anomaly acts just like a cosmological constant for these spacetimes .",
    "hence a positive trace anomaly permits a de sitter solution to the einstein equations @xcite .",
    "this is very interesting from the point of view of cosmology , as pointed out by starobinsky @xcite .",
    "starobinsky showed that the de sitter solution is unstable , but could be long - lived , and decays into a matter dominated friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "the purpose of starobinsky s work was to demonstrate that quantum effects of matter fields might resolve the big bang singularity .",
    "from a modern perspective , it is more interesting that the conformal anomaly might have been the source of a finite but significant period of inflation in the early universe .",
    "this inflation would be followed by particle production and ( p)reheating during the subsequent matter dominated phase .",
    "starobinsky s work is reviewed and extended by vilenkin in @xcite . for a more recent discussion of the starobinsky model , see @xcite .",
    "starobinsky showed that the de sitter phase is unstable both to the future and to the past , so it was not clear how the universe could have entered the de sitter phase .",
    "however , this problem can be overcome by an appeal to quantum cosmology , which predicts that the de sitter phase of the universe is created by semi - classical tunneling from nothing .",
    "this process is mediated by a four sphere cosmological instanton @xcite .",
    "one of the results of this paper is that the four sphere is not the only cosmological instanton in this model .    in order to test the starobinsky model ,",
    "it is necessary to compare its predictions for the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with observation .",
    "this was partly addressed by vilenkin @xcite .",
    "using an equation derived by starobinsky @xcite , vilenkin showed that the amplitude of long wavelength gravitational waves could be brought within observational limits at the expense of some fine - tuning of the coefficients parameterizing the trace anomaly .",
    "density perturbations were discussed by starobinsky in @xcite .",
    "the analysis of starobinsky and vilenkin was complicated by the fact that tensor perturbations destroy the conformal flatness of a frw background , making the effective action for matter fields hard to calculate .",
    "however , we now have a way of calculating the effective action for a particular theory , namely @xmath7 @xmath8 super yang - mills theory , using the ads / cft correspondence @xcite . in this paper we will calculate the effective action for this theory in a perturbed de sitter background .",
    "this enables us to calculate the correlation function for metric perturbations around the de sitter background .",
    "we can then compare our results with observations .",
    "the fact that we are using the @xmath7 yang - mills theory is probably not significant , and we expect our results to be valid for any theory that is approximately massless during the de sitter phase .",
    "one might think that our results could shed light on the effects of matter interactions during inflation since ads / cft involves a strongly interacting field theory .",
    "however , as we shall explain , our results are actually independent of the yang - mills coupling",
    ".    our calculations will be performed in euclidean signature ( on the four sphere ) , and then analytically continued to lorentzian de sitter space .",
    "the condition that all perturbations are regular on the four sphere defines the initial quantum state for lorentzian perturbations .",
    "the four sphere instanton is much larger than the planck scale ( since we are dealing with a large @xmath5 theory ) , so there is a clear cut separation into background metric and fluctuation",
    ".    we shall include in our action higher derivative counterterms , which arise naturally in the renormalization of the yang - mills theory .",
    "there are three independent terms that are quadratic in the curvature tensors : the euler density , the square of the ricci scalar and the square of the weyl tensor .",
    "the former just contributes a multiple of the euler number to the action .",
    "metric perturbations do not change the euler number , so this term has no effect .",
    "the square of the ricci scalar has the important effect of adjusting the coefficient of the @xmath9 term in the trace anomaly .",
    "it is precisely this term that is responsible for the starobinsky instability , so by varying the coefficient of the @xmath10 counter term we can adjust the duration of inflation .",
    "the weyl - squared counterterm does not affect the trace anomaly but it can contribute to suppression of tensor perturbations .",
    "the effects of this term were neglected by starobinsky and vilenkin .",
    "they also neglected the effects of the non - local part of the matter effective action .",
    "we shall take full account of all these effects .",
    "vilenkin showed that the initial de sitter phase is followed by a phase of slow - roll inflation before inflation ends and the matter - dominated phase begins .",
    "since the horizon size grows significantly during this slow - roll phase , it is important to investigate whether modes we observe today left the horizon during the de sitter phase or during the slow - roll phase . if the present horizon size left during the de sitter phase , we find that the amplitude of metric fluctuations can be brought within observational bounds if @xmath5 , the number of colours , is of order @xmath11 .",
    "such a large value for @xmath5 is rather worrying , which leads us to the second possibility , that the present horizon size left during the slow - roll phase .",
    "our results then suggest that the coefficient of the @xmath10 term must be at most of order @xmath12 , and maybe much lower , but @xmath5 is unconstrained ( except by the requirement that the large @xmath5 approximation is valid so that ads / cft can be used ) .",
    "we also find that the tensor perturbations can be suppressed independently of the scalar perturbations by adjusting the coefficient of the weyl - squared counterterm in the action .",
    "inflation blows up small scale physics to macroscopic scales .",
    "this suggests that inflation may lead to observational consequences of small - scale modifications of einstein gravity , such as extra dimensions .",
    "however , we find that the non - local part of the matter effective action has the effect of strongly suppressing tensor fluctuations on very small scales , a result first noted in flat space by tomboulis @xcite .",
    "this suggests that any small - scale modifications to four dimensional einstein gravity would be unobservable in the cmb since matter fields would dominate the graviton propagator at the scales at which such modifications might be expected to become important .",
    "this result is probably not restricted to trace anomaly driven inflation since it is simply a consequence of the presence of a large number of matter fields .",
    "as we have mentioned , there really are a large number of matter fields in the universe and these will suppress small - scale graviton fluctuations in any model of inflation .",
    "we illustrate this point by considering a randall - sundrum ( rs ) @xcite version of the starobinsky model . in the rs model",
    ", our universe is regarded as a thin domain wall in anti - de sitter space ( ads ) .",
    "rs showed that linearized four dimensional gravity is recovered on the domain wall at distances much larger that the ads radius of curvature , but gravity looks five dimensional at smaller scales . therefore ,",
    "if the ads length scale is taken to be small , then the rs model is a short distance modification of four dimensional einstein gravity .",
    "we shall show that when the large @xmath5 field theory is included , the effects of the matter fields dominate the rs corrections to the graviton propagator and render them unobservable .",
    "this work is an extension of our previous paper @xcite to include the effects of scalar perturbations and the higher derivative counterterms in the action .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in section [ sec : o4 ] by showing that the starobinsky model has two instantons : the round four sphere and a new `` double bubble '' instanton .",
    "we consider only the four sphere instanton in this paper .",
    "in section [ sec : pert ] we use the ads / cft correspondence to calculate the effective action of the large @xmath5 yang - mills theory on a perturbed four sphere . coupling this to the gravitational action then allows us to compute the scalar and tensor graviton propagators on the four sphere . in section [ sec :",
    "analytic ] , we discuss the analytic structure of our propagators . the tensor propagator is shown to be free of ghosts . in section [ sec : cont ] , we show how our euclidean propagators are analytically continued to lorentzian signature . section [ sec : observe ] discusses two observational constraints on the starobinsky model , namely the duration of inflation and the amplitude of perturbations . in section [ sec : rs ] , we use the rs version of the starobinsky model as an example to illustrate how matter fields strongly suppress metric perturbations on small scales .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions and suggest possible directions for future work .",
    "[ sec : o4 ]      homogeneous isotropic frw universes are obtained by analytic continuation of cosmological instantons invariant under the action of an @xmath13 isometry group . in other words , we are interested in instantons with metrics of the form [ eqn : o4ans ] ds^2 = d^2 + b()^2 d_3 ^ 2",

    "we conclude that the effective action governing metric perturbations on the domain wall is s_eff = 2s_bulk[_0 ] + s_brane .",

    "@xmath153 is defined in equation [ eqn : fdef ] .",
    "equation [ eqn : rsfdef ] was derived in @xcite but the term involving @xmath29 was not included . in comparing our propagators in the rs model with those of the four dimensional model , we first render them dimensionless by dividing by @xmath300 .",
    "the scalar correlator for the rs model is very similar to that of the four dimensional model , as given by equation [ eqn : scalarcorrelator ] .",
    "the only difference is the @xmath110-dependence of the tachyon mass @xmath344 . as @xmath112",
    ", the four dimensional value is recovered .",
    "this is to be expected since , in this limit , @xmath345 , which implies @xmath346 using equation [ eqn : radsol ] .",
    "we have already discussed how the rs corrections are expected to be negligible when @xmath329 .",
    "note that as @xmath110 increases from @xmath220 to @xmath255 , @xmath344 just changes monotonically by a factor of @xmath347 .",
    "the analytic structure of the rs tensor propagator is very similar to the four dimensional case .",
    "there is always a pole at @xmath204 : this is the massless graviton of the rs model .",
    "other poles behave as discussed in subsection [ subsec : tensorprop ] .",
    "the tensor propagator appears to exhibit more interesting dependence on @xmath110 . the first term in equation [ eqn : rsfdef ] arises from the gravitational part of the action , so this is where differences between a rs model and the four dimensional model show up . as @xmath348",
    ", the first term tends to @xmath349 , in agreement with the four dimensional result ( equation [ eqn : fdef ] ) .",
    "for very small @xmath110 , the first term is @xmath350 .",
    "if @xmath110 is held fixed but large then the first term grows quadratically with @xmath40 as @xmath40 is increased but eventually becomes linear for sufficiently large @xmath40 , corresponding to gravity becoming five dimensional at short distances . thus the difference between a rs model and four dimensional gravity might be expected to show up in @xmath351 behaviour in the tensor propagator at large @xmath40 , rather than the usual @xmath352 behaviour . however , this neglects the effects of the matter fields , which are given by the other terms in equation [ eqn : rsfdef ] . at large @xmath40 , @xmath353 grows like @xmath170 and completely dominates the first term .",
    "therefore , at large @xmath40 the tensor propagator behaves like @xmath319 irrespective of whether one is considering a rs model or four dimensional gravity .",
    "the differences between the rs model and four dimensional gravity are drowned out by the damping effect of matter fields at short distances , rendering them unobservable .",
    "rs corrections are expected to be important at distances of order @xmath321 . if we take @xmath354 then all the tensor harmonics have wavelengths smaller than @xmath321 , not just the large @xmath40 ones",
    ". therefore , one might expect rs corrections to be important at small @xmath40 for such a small domain wall .",

    "taking @xmath354 corresponds to @xmath355 , so the matter on the domain wall still dominates the effect of the rs corrections .",
    "the rs corrections would be expected to be about as important as the matter on the wall when @xmath356 , which corresponds to @xmath357 . in other words ,",
    "the rs corrections only become large when the _ entire domain wall _ is smaller than the ads radius .",
    "one might worry that introducing a cut - off into the matter theory would spoil the damping at large @xmath40 .",
    "however , if we did have a momentum cut - off @xmath358 then we would need @xmath359 in order for field theory to be valid during inflation , as is always assumed .",
    "it therefore seems appropriate to take @xmath360 , which corresponds to @xmath361 .",
    "figure [ fig : compare ] shows that the matter fields dominate the propagator even for quite small @xmath40 , so introducing a cut - off would have little effect .",
    "there is now good observational evidence suggesting that the early universe underwent a period of inflationary expansion .",
    "most theoretical models of inflation involve a scalar field rolling down its potential .",
    "the simplicity of such models is attractive but they have several serious problems .",
    "all these models require contrived initial conditions  no explanation is given of why the scalar field was initially displaced from the minimum of its potential . secondly , in order to obtain sufficient inflation and small cmb fluctuations",
    ", the cmb potential has to be highly fine - tuned .",
    "finally , models of scalar field driven inflation usually disregard the effect of the large number of other fields in the universe .",
    "it is usually argued that the effect of such fields rapidly becomes negligible during inflation .",
    "however , as we have seen , this is not necessarily true because the trace anomaly of matter fields provides an additional contribution to the cosmological constant constant during inflation .    in this paper , we have argued in favour of starobinsky s model of trace anomaly driven inflation @xcite as an alternative to scalar field driven inflation . in starobinsky s model , the trace anomaly supports a de sitter phase of expansion which is unstable , but can be long lived .",
    "this model is better motivated from the point of view of initial conditions since quantum cosmology predicts that the de sitter universe can nucleate semi - classically via a four sphere instanton @xcite .",
    "we have seen that this model admits a second instanton .",
    "this can probably be interpreted in a similar way to the coleman - de luccia @xcite instanton , i.e. , as describing the semi - classical decay of the de sitter phase via nucleation of a pair of bubbles , each containing an open inflationary universe .",
    "owing to the lack of an analytic solution for this instanton , we have concentrated on the four sphere instanton in this paper .    during the de sitter phase , particle masses would have been small compared with the spacetime curvature so matter fields would have been classically conformally invariant .",
    "moreover , we observe a large number of fields today and supersymmetry predicts that there should be many more , so the large @xmath5 approximation is justified in studies of trace anomaly driven inflation .",
    "this leads to a very attractive way of calculating the effective action of matter fields during the de sitter phase , viz the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "using ads / cft , we have presented the first calculation of scalar and tensor metric propagators for trace anomaly driven inflation , taking full account of the back - reaction of matter fields .    in order for the de sitter phase to be unstable",
    ", it is necessary for the coefficient @xmath362 of the @xmath9 term in the trace anomaly to be negative ( in our conventions ) .",
    "we therefore included a @xmath10 counterterm in the action to control this coefficient .",
    "we also took account of the other curvature squared counterterms .",
    "we demonstrated that the amplitude of long wavelength metric perturbations could be brought within observational bounds at the expense of fine - tuning of @xmath307 .",
    "this fine - tuning is no worse than required in scalar field driven inflation , and agrees with the results of vilenkin @xcite .",
    "in fact , the amount of tuning required may be much less than for scalar field driven inflation .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the slow - roll phase would be required to verify this .",
    "one might worry that introducing a @xmath10 counterterm into the action would lead to observational consequences for , say , solar system physics .",
    "however , the effect of this term in flat space is just to introduce a scalar field whose mass is of order @xmath363 . even though @xmath237 is very large , this mass is still much too large to lead to observable effects today .",
    "for example , taking @xmath311 and @xmath29 of order @xmath240 gives a mass of order @xmath364 .",
    "our tensor propagator exhibits interesting analytic structure .",
    "we have shown that ghosts can be removed without fine - tuning , although this introduces a pair of complex conjugate poles .",
    "such poles were studied long ago and found to correspond to violations of causality .",
    "we have seem that this causality violation occurs on a time scale @xmath239 , where @xmath48 is the hubble time .",
    "this time scale is much smaller than @xmath48 when @xmath237 is large enough to bring the amplitude of metric perturbations within the observational bound .",
    "at large @xmath40 , the tensor propagator exhibits the behaviour first discovered for flat space by tomboulis @xcite , namely suppression of metric perturbations by matter fields .",
    "this suppression does not involve fine - tuning , as required for suppression of long - wavelength perturbations .",
    "the matter fields make the tensor propagator decay like @xmath319 at large wavenumber @xmath40 .",
    "this behaviour would be expected whenever the large @xmath5 expansion is valid .",
    "since we observe a large number of matter fields , we have argued that this suppression should occur even if inflation were not driven by a trace anomaly .",
    "this implies that matter fields damp out the effects of any short distance modifications of gravity ( such as extra dimensions ) , rendering them unobservable .",
    "we illustrated this effect by comparing the propagators for trace anomaly driven inflation in four dimensions and in a randall - sundrum model . at large @xmath40 , the tensor propagators are indistinguishable and at small @xmath40 they only differ when the entire domain wall is smaller than the radius of curvature of the fifth dimension .",
    "there are many directions in which our work could be extended .",
    "for example , our use of ads / cft has restricted us to a strongly coupled theory .",
    "however , we have argued that our 2-point functions are independent of the yang - mills coupling .",
    "dependence on the coupling would be expected to show up in higher order correlation functions of metric perturbations .",
    "this implies that these higher order correlation functions would not be determined by the 2-point functions , so the spectrum of cmb fluctuations would exhibit non - gaussianity .    in the einstein static universe ,",
    "the strongly coupled yang - mills theory exhibits a confinement/ de - confinement transition at a certain temperature , corresponding to two different bulk solutions in the ads / cft correspondence @xcite",
    ". one might therefore wonder whether there is a bulk solution different from pure ads which could have a spherical boundary with an @xmath13 symmetric metric .",
    "if so , then one might have a phase transition in a cosmological background .",
    "this does not appear possible . to see this ,",
    "assume that the @xmath13 isometry group of the boundary implies a corresponding @xmath13 isometry group in the bulk ( we are thinking of a cut - off cft , corresponding to a finite boundary ) .",
    "birkhoff s theorem then implies that the bulk is ( euclidean ) schwarzschild - ads .",
    "however , in order for the instanton to have spherical topology , the orbits of the @xmath13 group have to degenerate at two points on the instanton ( the poles ) and this is not possible if the bulk is schwarzschild - ads except when the mass parameter vanishes .",
    "in other words , there is a unique solution ( pure ads ) in the bulk and therefore no phase transition .",
    "this bulk solution corresponds to a deconfined phase of the yang - mills theory ( this is evident from the overall @xmath37 factor in the yang - mills effective action ) .",
    "when one has a choice between several cosmological instantons , one usually argues that the instanton with the least euclidean action is preferred , on the basis that this instanton would give the dominant contribution to a gravitational path integral .",
    "instantons which are saddle points , rather than local minima of the action , would not be viewed as satisfactory .",
    "these instantons would possess negative modes , corresponding to directions in field space along which the action decreases .",
    "such instantons have been extensively discussed in @xcite , where it was argued that they may be interpreted as describing quantum tunneling in an existing universe , rather than creation of a universe from nothing .",
    "since we have found two instantons , it would be interesting to examine whether they have negative modes",
    ". this could give support to the idea that the double bubble instanton describes an instability of the de sitter vacuum .",
    "any discussion of negative modes presupposes the existence of a gravitational path integral .",
    "this is not well - defined even for einstein gravity since it is well - known that the euclidean gravitational action is unbounded below . in our case , the presence of the @xmath10 counterterm with a negative coefficient appears to make matters even worse .",
    "however , it is known that einstein gravity coupled to a @xmath10 term can be rewritten as einstein gravity coupled to a scalar field @xcite so the situation is probably no worse than usual .",
    "we have emphasized that there are two instantons in the starobinsky model .",
    "however , there is also a third , namely flat space viewed as the infinite radius limit of the four sphere .",
    "this has infinitely negative euclidean action .",
    "it might therefore be necessary to invoke the anthropic principle to explain why an inflationary universe is nucleated rather than an empty flat universe .",
    "the situation is analagous to false vacuum decay @xcite , for which the instanton describing nucleation of a universe in the true vacuum state has lower action than the instanton describing nucleation of a universe in the false vacuum state .",
    "clearly there is plenty of scope for future work on understanding the quantum cosmology of the starobinsky model .",
    "our approach was based on decomposing the metric perturbation into scalar , vector and tensor representations of @xmath365 , or @xmath366 .",
    "this made the ads / cft calculation relatively straightforward , but means that our results are only directly applicable to the initial de sitter phase , although we have argued that the amplitude of metric perturbations should not increase during the slow roll phase . in order to produce a detailed fluctuation spectrum that could be compared with observation",
    ", it would be necessary to do a calculation based on a decomposition into scalar , vector and tensor represenations of @xmath13 ( assuming a closed universe ) .",
    "if the ads / cft calculation could be extended to perturbations around a euclidean background with a general @xmath13 invariant metric then , by analytic continuation , one could calculate how the metric propagators evolve during the slow - roll phase .",
    "the perturbations spectrum at the end of inflation could then be used to predict the detailed spectrum of temperature fluctuations in the cmb .",
    "an @xmath13 approach would also be necessary to investigate the double bubble instanton ."
