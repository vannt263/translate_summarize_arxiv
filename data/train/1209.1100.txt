    "our understanding of how galaxies assemble their mass over cosmic time has advanced considerably in the last decade .",
    "there have emerged observationally - defined scaling relations that link metallicity , stellar mass , and star formation rates ( sfrs ) in galaxies for lookback times of up to @xmath110gyr .",
    "the rate at which galaxies form stars is correlated with their stellar mass , up to @xmath6@xmath5where the trend flattens .",
    "this trend , known as the `` main sequence of star formation '' ( sfms ) has roughly the same slope up to redshifts @xmath73 , but an increasing normalization such that higher redshift galaxies produce more stars for their mass than low - redshift ones @xcite .",
    "thus , high - redshift populations tend to have higher specific sfrs ( sfr divided by stellar mass , ssfr ) than nearby galaxies , although there is still some debate about whether at all redshifts higher ssfrs are observed in less massive galaxies than in their more massive counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "metallicity and stellar mass are also related ( the mass - metallicity relation , mzr ) , but through a somewhat tighter correlation @xcite . a secondary dependence of the mzr on sfr , dubbed the `` fundamental metallicity relation '' ( fmr ) , reduces the scatter considerably for local galaxy populations @xcite .",
    "@xcite extended the fmr to lower stellar masses with gamma - ray - burst host galaxies , but it is still unable to encompass the properties of galaxies at @xmath8 , and as we show below , also in nearby metal - poor starbursts .",
    "although the sfms and the mzr ( and fmr ) are good at predicting the links among star formation , metallicity , and stellar mass for the bulk of galaxies up to redshifts of @xmath12 , some subsets of galaxy populations show clear departures from the main trends .",
    "in particular , vigorous starbursts with high sfrs tend to lie above the sfms at all redshifts and to have too much mass ( or luminosity ) for their metallicity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "usually , these high - sfr outliers are attributed to the merger mode of star formation ; galaxy - wide sf occurring over long dynamical times is thought to define the sf main sequence , while _ merger - induced bursts _ of star formation result in outliers from the main trend ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a companion paper @xcite , we propose that mergers may not be directly responsible for producing the starbursts that deviate from the general sfr - mass - metallicity relations , but rather that initial physical conditions , independently of their origin , may be driving the deviations .",
    "we develop different classes of models based on distinct sets of initial conditions , including mass and initial density of the galaxy , and size and density of the star - forming regions .",
    "these would correspond to different modes of star formation , an `` active '' or starburst mode , and a more `` passive '' , quiescent one , with which we successfully model the scaling relations of @xmath91100 galaxies . here , we present the sample of galaxies , and describe the observed scaling relations of metallicity , stellar mass , and star formation rate for the sample .      in this paper , we want to investigate the empirical connection between high-@xmath10 starbursts and metal - poor galaxies with high sfrs in the local universe .",
    "our aim is not to analyze the bulk of the star - forming galaxies representative of the local volume , as has already been done by several groups with the sdss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "rather , our intention is to identify classes of galaxies which deviate from the sfms and the mzr in the same way , placing particular emphasis on potential local analogues of high - redshift galaxy populations .",
    "the idea is that the outliers of well - defined scaling relations may reveal insights that can not be gained otherwise .",
    "hence , we require a sample that spans a wide range in parameter space , in order to adequately characterize trends with metallicity , sfr , and stellar mass over a large redshift interval .    as we show below , some low - metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) have high sfrs , particularly high ssfrs , and",
    "occupy the same locus of the mzr and the sfms as @xmath11 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "relative to the main trend , these objects have an excess of @xmath12100 in stellar mass at a given metallicity , and a factor of @xmath13 excess sfr at a given mass .",
    "the same is true for some of the `` green peas '' and luminous compact galaxies ( lcgs ) at @xmath14 selected by @xcite and @xcite from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "it seems evident that sfr ( or sfr surface density @xmath15 , which is more difficult to measure ) is governed by similar physical conditions at all redshifts , and that which galaxy populations are observed at a given redshift depends on how they are selected .",
    "because extreme starbursts are rare locally , but more common at high redshift , selection effects may be paramount in defining observed trends among stellar mass , metallicity , and sfr .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : samples ] we present several samples of dwarf galaxies in the local universe , two samples of intermediate - redshift galaxies ( the  green peas  and lcgs ) , and several samples of lbgs at @xmath16 .",
    "we also explain how we derive stellar masses from 4.5observations for the nearby galaxy samples .",
    "[ sec : lms ] identifies a class of `` low - metallicity starbursts '' on the basis of deviations from the main scaling relations observed at low and high redshift .",
    "a `` fundamental plane '' of metallicity , stellar mass , and star formation rate independent of redshift is introduced in sect .",
    "[ sec : fp ] , and its characteristics are compared with common perceptions of the sfms and the mzr . in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we discuss possible similarities between nearby starbursts and starbursts at high redshift , and possible ramifications for our current conception of galaxy evolution .",
    "because of the need to compare sfr , metal abundance [ as defined by the nebular oxygen abundance , 12@xmath17(o / h ) ] , and stellar mass , @xmath0 , we have selected only samples of galaxies which either have these quantities already available in the literature , or for which we could derive them from published data .",
    "five sets of galaxies in the local universe met these criteria : the nearby dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirr ) published by ( * ? ? ? * here dubbed  dirr  ) , the 11mpc distance - limited sample of nearby galaxies ( 11hugs , lvl : * ? ? ?",

    "the extension to lower masses by @xcite has a flatter dependence of o / h on @xmath128 , 0.51 ( see above ) , but the same value of 0.32 relating ( log)sfr to @xmath0 . for the fp",
    ", we find a shallower dependence of o / h on @xmath0  ( 0.33 ) , and a sfr coefficient of @xmath136 ; multiplying 0.33 ( our mass dependence ) by the 0.32 sfr factor of @xcite would give a sfr dependence of @xmath137 , very similar to the value of @xmath136 given by the pca .",
    "from a sample of @xmath138 galaxies spanning a wide range of o / h , sfr , and @xmath0 , we have identified a class of low - metallicity starbursts which deviate from the sfms and the mzr in the same way , independently of redshift . when these scaling relations are considered together ,",
    "the sample as a whole ( although excluding the galaxies with @xmath0@xmath139@xmath5 ) defines a fundamental plane whose orientation is defined primarily by sfr and @xmath0 , and whose thickness is governed by o / h .",
    "the two - dimensional nature of the plane in the 3-space defined by the observables implies that only two parameters are necessary to describe a galaxy ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the thinness of the plane when viewed edge - on enables the formulation of a relation which combines the sfms and the mzr in an optimal way . through application of a pca",
    ", we have established a dependence of o / h on sfr and @xmath0  which has a deviation over the whole sample ( for @xmath0@xmath4@xmath5 ) of 0.17dex , or @xmath148% .",
    "the fp from the pca applied to the sdss sample used to define the fmr @xcite is similar to that obtained for our sample ( see eqs .  [",
    "eqn : fp ] , [ eqn : fpsdss ] ) .",
    "applying either fp to our sample and to the fmr - sdss shows an offset in metallicity which distinguishes the two , but the dispersions are similarly low ( 0.17dex and 0.06dex for our and the fmr - sdss samples , respectively ) .",
    "however , the fmr is not the best description of our sample , as it gives a higher dispersion ( 0.27dex ) than either fp .",
    "perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the fps given by the pca is that they hold for all the redshifts we have examined , @xmath140 . in our sample , the lbgs at all redshifts follow the `` fundamental plane '' relation which combines the mzr and the sfms .",
    "_ there are no high - redshift outliers .",
    "_ moreover , the low - metallicity starbursts at all redshifts also follow the relation . on the basis of o / h , sfr , and stellar mass alone ,",
    "apparently there is no distinction between the behavior of galaxies in the local universe and those at high redshift ( at least up to @xmath141 ) .",
    "the statistical analysis does not clarify which relation or which observable is the most important ; it merely indicates that there is a _ plane _ that describes the family of galaxies in the 3-space of o / h , sfr , and @xmath0 .",
    "however , the small amount of variance contained in the eigenvector dominated by metallicity ( pc3 ) suggests that metallicity is the least important of the three parameters in driving the variance of our sample .",
    "the physics of why or how these parameters conspire to form a plane independent of redshift will be explored in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "there we show that the deviations from the main scaling relations are due to a different mode of star formation , a starburst or `` active '' mode which evolves over relatively short timescales .",
    "the main scaling relations are instead defined by a more quiescent , `` passive '' mode of star formation which evolves more slowly .",
    "the existence of a fundamental plane that spans redshifts up to @xmath142 implies that the sfms and mzr do not really change with lookback time , but rather that the galaxy populations that define them change with redshift .",
    "starbursts become increasingly common at high redshift , but they also exist locally and at low metallicity .",
    "thus , the `` evolution '' in the scaling relations is a result of selecting those galaxies which are most common at a particular redshift , and may not reflect a true change in the physics of how galaxies evolve .",
    "we warmly thank the international space science institute ( issi ) for financial support for our collaboration , modulo ( molecules and dust and low metallicity ) , so that we could meet and discuss the work for this paper .",
