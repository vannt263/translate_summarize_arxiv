    "the distribution of @xmath81 is gaussian with a random mean which depends on the environment and has an asymptotic gaussian distribution by itself .",

    "however if @xmath94 , under some symmetry conditions that ensure that @xmath95 , a central limit theorem was proved by bricmont and kupiainen @xcite , provided the randomness in the environment is small .",
    "a recent preprint by sznitman and zeitouni @xcite provides an alternate proof .",

    "the law of large numbers and central limit theorem involve the differentiability of @xmath97 at @xmath98 , which is harder .",
    "in fact large deviation results have been proved by general sub - additivity arguments for the quenched case . roughly speaking fixing @xmath40 , @xmath99{\\geqslant}q^\\omega[s_k\\simeq ka]\\times q^{\\tau_{ka}\\omega}[s_\\ell\\simeq \\ell a].\\ ] ] one",

    "the problem is that the measure @xmath83 is not very nice .",
    "as the random walk explores @xmath0 it learns about the environment and in the case of the product environment , when it returns to a site that it has visited before , the experience has not been forgotten and leads to long term correlations .",
    "however , if we are interested in the behavior @xmath102 with @xmath103 , the same site is not visited too often and the correlations should decay fast . this can be exploited to provide a proof of ( [ ldpa ] ) .",

    "it is not hard to see that the _ a posteriori _ probability can be calculated as @xmath115 while this makes sense initially only for walks of finite length it can clearly be extended to all transient paths . note that although we only use @xmath116 , in order to obtain the new @xmath117 we would need to know @xmath118 .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath119 is a process with stationary increments @xmath120 . if the increments process were ergodic and had a non - zero mean @xmath121 we can again make the current position the origin and the process will be transient .",
