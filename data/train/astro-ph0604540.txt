    "ngc  5253 is a nearby , low - metallicity dwarf galaxy with a recent starburst , which is responsible for its infrared luminosity of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "distance estimates vary from @xmath8  mpc @xcite to @xmath9  mpc @xcite ; here we will assume 4.0  mpc , corresponding to 19.4  pc/@xmath10 . with its low metallicity of only about @xmath11 @xcite ngc",
    "5253 is an excellent target to study starbursts in a low - metallicity environment .",
    "the spectral signatures of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars suggest a very recent starburst ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite detected 115 star clusters using optical and near - infrared vlt images at an age range of 3 - 19  myr .",
    "@xcite found a compact radio source representing a hidden super star cluster ( ssc ) in one of the earliest phases of ssc formation ever observed .",
    "its ionizing flux corresponds to several thousand o7v star equivalents within the central @xmath12 @xcite and an infrared luminosity of @xmath13 @xcite . near - infrared observations with hubble space telescope revealed the presence of a double star cluster in the nuclear region , separated by @xmath14  pc @xcite .",
    "there are indications that an interaction with m81 might have provoked the starburst @xcite .",
    "ngc  5253 has also been studied in the mid - ir with the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ by several authors , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . with _",
    "s increased sensitivity @xcite and the smaller slit apertures , the _ irs _ can continue where _ iso _ left off . in this letter",
    "we report on the spatial variations of the physical conditions in the central region of ngc  5253 , based on _ irac _ images and _ irs _ @xcite spectral maps .",
    "the images were obtained on 2005 january 31 using irac @xcite at all four bands ( @xmath15 m ) .",
    "the observations consist of 12 slightly dithered pointings of @xmath16s exposures each .",
    "the data were pipeline processed by the spitzer science center .",
    "longward of @xmath17 m the irac images show only one compact cluster and no structure of the host galaxy . to assess what fraction of the total luminosity of the central region is provided by the central cluster we compare the flux within the central 44  pc ( 2 pixel ) to the total flux within a radius of 330 pc for each channel .",
    "the results in table 1 show the increasing dominance of the starburst nucleus in luminosity with wavelength .",
    "we subtracted the _ irac _ instrumental psfs from the nucleus for all four channels , and the residuals suggest that the central cluster remains unresolved in the _ irac _ images , which is consistent with its very compact size @xcite .",

    "mode , the map consists of 12 different pointings , overlapping by half a slit width and about one third slit length , covering an area of @xmath20 . in lh ( long - high ) mode the map consists of only 6 different pointings , covering an area of @xmath21 .",
    "1 shows the sh and lh slit positions overlaid on the _ irac _ image of the central region .",
    "both maps are slightly off - center .",
    "additional `` sky '' measurements , 6  arcmin from the nucleus were also taken .",
    "the basic processing of the data was performed with version  11.0 of the automated _ irs _ pipeline at the spitzer science center .",
    "the background was subtracted using the sky images .",
    "the spectra were extracted in `` full - slit '' mode from pre - flat - fielded files using the _ irs _ data reduction and analysis package smart , version 5.5 @xcite .",
    "the extracted spectra were flux calibrated with an empirically derived rsrf ( relative spectral response function ) of @xmath22 lac .",
    "the spectral overlaps between orders were manually clipped , according to the local s / n .",
    "finally , the sh spectra were scaled up by 16% to match the lh continuum fluxes at 19  @xmath4 m .",
    "this discrepancy in the fluxes is due to the difference between the sh and lh slit sizes .",
    "the complete @xmath23 m sh+lh spectrum at the most central position of our map is shown in fig .",
    "2 . with a smooth continuum with no significant absorption features , and turnover in the slope around @xmath24 m , it is dominated by the strong emission lines of [ siv]@xmath25 m , [ neii]@xmath26 m , [ neiii]@xmath27 m , [ siii]@xmath28 m , [ siii]@xmath29 m and [ siii]@xmath30 m .",
    "also detected are the signature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) at @xmath31 m and hu@xmath22 at @xmath32 m up to a distance of @xmath33 pc .",
    "3 shows eight representative sh spectra at decreasing radial distances , calculated from the central cluster to the center of each slit position .",
    "the remaining four spectra of our map are redundant and not shown to save space .",
    "the most prominent spectral features are labeled .",
    "the line fluxes for each radial position are listed in table 2 .      with ionization potentials of 21.56  ev and 40.95  ev for ne and ne@xmath34 , respectively",
    ", the [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio is a good measure of the hardness of the radiation field , and traces the ob stars . @xcite measured a relatively low [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio of @xmath35 .",
    "however , the larger _ iso - sws _ slit apertures of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , centered on the nucleus , may have also picked up significant line flux at lower excitation from the surrounding galactic population . with the smaller _ irs _ slit aperture of @xmath38 we can probe the influence of spatial resolution on the measured spectral diagnostics .",
    "the upper plot of fig .",
    "4 shows the [ neiii]/[neii ] and [ siv]/[siii ] ratios as functions of the distance to the central cluster . both ratios decrease by a factor of four over 250 parsecs , indicating a significant softening of the uv radiation field with distance from the cluster core , and",
    "trace each other remarkably well , with the ne ratio being about @xmath3 times higher at all distances .",
    "our high [ neiii]/[neii ] ratio at the central cluster is comparable to those observed in nearby hii regions like 30  doradus and low - metallicity dwarf galaxies like ii  zw  40 @xcite .",
    "@xcite modeled ne line ratios for star clusters at low metallicity @xmath39 and showed that a peak ratio of 7.0 is consistent with an upper mass cutoff of @xmath40 , at an age of @xmath41  myr .",
    "it has often been asked if pahs in low - metallicity starbursts appear to be weaker because of low abundance or because they get destroyed by the generally harder radiation fields in these environments ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "our high s / n spectra clearly reveal , for the first time , the presence of the @xmath31 m pah feature in all sh positions on ngc  5253 , which shows that pahs can be present in a low metallicity environment .",
    "the center plot of fig .",
    "4 shows a steady increase of the pah equivalent width ( ew ) with distance .",
    "we assume constant metallicity throughout the galaxy , as no known dwarf has steep metallicity gradients @xcite . in fig .",
    "4 we have investigated the correlation between the measured pah strength and the `` strength '' of the uv radiation field , defined by the product of the hardness and the intensity of the radiation field , [ neiii]/[neii]@xmath42([neiii]+[neii ] ) . the bottom plot shows the product between the uv field and the pah strengths as a function of distance .",
    "this product stays almost constant out to a radial distance of 200 pc , meaning that the strength of the uv field and the strength of the pah emission is strongly anti - correlated .",
    "the good anti - correlation over such a large distance ( encompassing numerous hii regions ) suggests that the photo - destruction of pahs could be the dominant mechanism here .",
    "we note that pah emission models @xcite show that photoionization of hydrogen in pahs can also cause a decrease in the relative pah strength above @xmath43 m .",
    "however , we consider this effect unlikely since no ionization effect has been seen in other starburst galaxies @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "a low metallicity system like sbs 0335 - 052 , where no pahs have been detected , has a ne ratio of 4.9 @xcite and some of the low metallicity systems with weak pahs studied by @xcite have a ne ratio of @xmath44 . as seen in fig .",
    "4 , these ratios correspond to a radial distance inside the pah destruction zone in ngc 5253 .      with an excitation potential of 54.9  ev",
    ", the [ oiv]25.89@xmath4 m line fills the wide energetic gap of mid - ir fine - structure lines between lines that can originate from massive stars and lines that likely require an agn .",
    "it has been attributed to various mechanisms , including very hot stars @xcite and energetic shocks for low - excitation starbursts @xcite .",
    "our high s / n spectra reveal a faint [ oiv ] line at two slit positions outside the central cluster , with fluxes of about @xmath5w @xmath6 at a s / n of 7.1 .",
    "this is higher than the limits given by @xcite ( @xmath45w ) , but below the upper limit of @xcite ( @xmath46w @xmath6 ) , and in reasonable agreement with the flux measured by @xcite ( @xmath47w @xmath6 ) . using the starburst99 code ( leitherer et al .",
    "1999 ) assuming an instantaneous burst of star formation with a salpeter @xcite imf at 1/5 solar metallicity , the observed oiv emission can be produced by roughly 125 wr stars ( wc+wn ) , consistent with the wide range of o7v star equivalents @xcite within the central @xmath48 .",
    "a detailed discussion is given in @xcite .",
    "however , as the [ oiv ] emission is only observed in two lh slit positions off the nucleus , it is not obvious that the [ oiv ] line is predominantly photo - excited by the central wr stars .",
    "other excitation mechanisms , such as shocks , need to be considered .",
