    "charm is predicted to be produced primarily in gluon fusion reactions in the early stages of a collision @xcite .",
    "if charm is indeed produced in initial hard ( high @xmath3 ) processes , one will observe that charm production scales with the number of binary ( nucleon - nucleon ) collisions .",
    "the charm production cross - section can be calculated by summing up feynman diagrams at the `` fixed - order plus next - to - leading - log ( fonll ) '' level .",
    "the total charm cross - section per binary collision as predicted by fonll for @xmath1 = 200 gev is @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "both the star and phenix experiments at rhic observe binary scaling when comparing p+p to au+au ( phenix ) and d+au to au+au ( star ) ; however , previously measured charm cross - sections in star and phenix differ above declared uncertainties @xcite .",
    "also , current fonll calculations under - predict measured star charm cross - section values @xcite .",
    "this may suggest that different physical processes are at play than are assumed by fonll calculations .",
    "this analysis uses data taken with the time projection chamber ( tpc ) at the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) , one of the experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national lab ( bnl ) .",
    "the tpc measures an energy loss per unit distance , de / dx , by particles ionization of the p10 gas in the detector s chamber .",
    "the momentum is measured through the particles curvature in a 0.5 t magnetic field @xcite . by using a bichsel parameterization , a particle identification ( pid )",
    "is acquired .",
    "the @xmath5 invariant mass spectrum is reconstructed via the @xmath2 decay channel . the @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 )",
    "invariant mass is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the angle between @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the invariant mass spectrum was extracted from 28.7 million cu+cu minimum bias events at @xmath12 gev .",
    "then the uncorrelated background was subtracted via the rotational background subtraction method . to implement this method one of the daughter tracks in a two body decay is rotated in momentum space to every 5 degrees from 150 to 210 degrees in the plane transverse to the beam line .",
    "after the background is subtracted a peak with a statistical significance of @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , s = area of signal peak , b = background under peak ) is seen ( see figure [ d0]a ) .    @xmath15 % \\cr .",

    "figure [ d0]b shows a transverse momentum spectrum for @xmath16 at mid - rapidity . efficiency and acceptance corrections , as calculated from a detailed geant simulation of the star detector , and a branching ratio correction of @xmath17 @xcite were applied .",
    "an @xmath18 exponential fit is done to the spectrum ( @xmath19 ) . by integrating over the entire @xmath20 spectra",
    ", we find that @xmath21 = @xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath21 yield is converted to a cross - section via @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the charm cross - section per binary collision , @xmath25 mb is the proton+proton inelastic cross - section @xcite , @xmath26 is the average number of binary nucleon collisions in a cu+cu minimum bias collision found using the glauber model , @xmath27 is a normalization factor to extrapolate to full rapidity ( based on pythia simulation ) @xcite , and @xmath28 is the ratio of @xmath6 to @xmath29 , measured in @xmath30 collider events @xcite . the preliminary cu+cu charm cross - section is thus calculated to be @xmath31 mb and is shown in figure [ cucu_cross_section ] .",
    "evaluation of systematic error bars for the cu+cu measurement is in progress .",
    "this new measurement confirms previous star measurements @xcite showing that charm production follows a binary scaling from p+p to central au+au collisions .",
    "star measured @xmath5 in cu+cu collisions with a statistical significance of @xmath13 . the charm cross - section in @xmath1",
    "= 200 gev minimum bias cu+cu collisions was measured to be @xmath31 mb .",
    "this is consistent with binary scaling when compared to other star measurements , verifying charm production via hard processes in the initial stages of the collision .",
