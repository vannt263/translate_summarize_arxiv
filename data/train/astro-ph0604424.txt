    "we consider accretion disks of bodies in formation when the differential rotation drags around magnetic field lines . although the moving magnetic fields inevitably generate electric fields , the resulting emfs are perpendicular to the magnetic fields in the perfect conduction approximation .",
    "such emfs do not accelerate particles to high energies .",
    "however the world is not a perfect place ; in regions where perfect mhd predicts very high current densities there may be too few charge carriers to carry those currents . in those regions perfect",
    "conductivity is not a good approximation and the fields are modified to allow an electric field component along the magnetic field so that the larger current can be generated by the few charge carriers available . with this background idea",
    "it becomes interesting to get rough estimates of emfs that are likely to be around whatever their direction .",
    "it turns out that these emfs scale with @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the maximum velocity in the accretion disk and is independent of the size or mass of the system .",
    "relativistic systems in formation , however small , can generate emfs whose voltages at least match those of the highest energy cosmic rays . however the timescales over which these systems persist and the total energies available over those time scales do of course depend on the mass of the system .",
    "very crude estimates of the emfs can be made as follows .",
    "let us suppose that there is a central object , a star or a black hole , of mass @xmath9 surrounded by an accretion disk of mass @xmath10 .",
    "further let us suppose that a small fraction @xmath11 of the binding energy of the accretion disk is converted into magnetic field energy .",
    "letting r be the inner radius of the disk we put @xmath12 so @xmath13 . , where @xmath14 .",
    "fields of a few hundred gauss are found in t tauri stars , so putting @xmath15 cm @xmath16km / s we find @xmath17 .",
    "we shall use this dimensionless number to make estimates elsewhere .",
    "now the emf generated around a circuit that goes up the axis and back to the disk around a field line and finally along the disk back to the centre is about @xmath18 in esu and 300 times that in volts so emf= 300 @xmath19 volts .",
    "kronberg et al ( 2004 ) considered such accelerative processes in radio galaxies .",
    "again only a fraction of this voltage will be available to accelerate particles ; in the exact flux freezing case it is all perpendicular to the fields , nevertheless it is an estimate of what might be available where the perfect conductivity approximation breaks down .",
    "although the argument is crude the answer is interesting in that it suggests that cosmic rays generated in microquasars may reach the same individual particle energies as those generated in quasars and radio galaxies which may match the highest cosmic ray energies .",
    "curtis photographed the jet in m 87 from the lick observatory in 1918 .",
    "while it was soon found to be blue , the emission process was not understood despite schott s detailed calculations of synchrotron radiation in his 1912 book . finally after shklovskii introduced this emission mechanism into astrophysics baade ( 1956 ) showed the jet to be highly polarized which clinched it .",
    "although ryle s cambridge group ( 1968 ) found many double radio lobes around large galaxies the next obvious jet came with the identification of the first quasar 3c273 in which the dominant radio source is not at the nucleus but at the other end of the optical jet ( hazard , mackey & shimmins 1963 ; schmidt 1963 ) .",
    "there were difficulties in understanding the powering of the radio lobes of galaxies .",
    "if all the energy were present as the lobes expanded outwards there would be more bright small ones .",
    "finally this led rees ( 1971 ) to suggest that the lobes must be continuously powered by as - yet - unseen jets feeding energy into the visible lobes .",
    "as radio astronomy moved to higher frequencies with greater resolution these jets duly appeared in both radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "all the above jets have dynamically significant magnetic fields seen via their synchrotron radiation ; a particularly fine study of one , herculis a , is found in gizani & leahy ( 2003 ) .",
    "magnetic fields are less obvious in the herbig - haro objects first found in star - forming regions in 1951 .",
    "however it took the development of good infra - red detectors before the heavy obscuration was penetrated in the 1980s to reveal the jets feeding the emission .",
    "these jets have velocities of one or two hundred km / s , far less than the @xmath20 speeds of the extragalactic jets .",
    "the jets around young stars are seen to be perpendicular to the accretion discs that generate them .",
    "since the giant black - hole accretion disk theory of quasars salpeter ( 1964 ) , lynden - bell ( 1969 ) , bardeen ( 1970 ) , lynden - bell & rees ( 1971 ) shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 , 1976 ) many have come to believe that the radio galaxies and quasars likewise have jets perpendicular to their inner disks .",
    "however it was not until the wonderful work on megamasers ( miyoshi et al .",
    "1995 ) that such inner disks around black holes were definitively confirmed . in 1969 when i predicted that they would inhabit the nuclei of most major galaxies including our own , m31 , m32 , m81 , m87 , etc .",
    ", the idea was considered outlandish , but now most astronomers take it for granted .",
    "fine work by kormendy ( 1995 ) and others on external galaxies and the beautiful results of genzel ( 2003 ) and ghez ( 2004 ) on our own has totally transformed the situation .",
    "meanwhile many jets have been found in objects associated with dying stars , ss433 and the micro - quasars mirabel & rodriguez ( 1999 ) being prominent examples within the galaxy .",
    "less energetic but more beautiful examples may be the tubular planetary nebulae that are associated with accretion discs of central mass - exchanging binary stars .",
    "these were brought to my attention by mark morris and recent evidence indicates that magnetism is important here too ( vlemmings et al 2006 ) . much more spectacularly the @xmath21-ray bursts are now thought to come from accretion - disks around black holes within some supernova explosions .",
    "poynting flows of electromagnetic energy appear to be one of the best ways of extracting the energy from beneath the baryons that would otherwise absorb the @xmath21-rays , uzdensky & macfadyen ( 2006 ) .",
    "jets and collimated outflows have also been invoked for giant stars .",
    "remarkable examples are r aquarii ( michalitsanos et al .",
    "1988 ) and the egg nebula ( cohen et al . 2004 ) and the collimated outflow in irg 10011 ( vinkovi 2004 ) .",
    "the systematic features of these diverse objects are that an accretion disk is present and the jet emerges along the rotation axis of the inner disk .",
    "magnetic fields are important in the radio objects and may be important in all .",
    "the jet velocities are strongly correlated with the escape velocities and therefore with the circular velocities in the disk close to the central object . in very collapsed objects",
    "these velocities are relativistic but in star - forming regions the jet velocities are less than @xmath22 .",
    "the obvious similarity of the jet structures and collimation despite such velocity differences strongly suggest that relativity is not a determining factor in the making of these jets .",
    "the thesis that i put forward in 1996 ( paper ii ) and repeat here , is that all these jets are magnetically driven , the common feature being that the poynting flux dominates the energy transport in the jet .",
    "however i do not exclude the possibility of material being entrained as the jet makes its way through the material that surrounds it .",
    "nevertheless we consider that magnetism is the driver and the prime reason for collimation is the magnetic twisting combined with a weak external pressure which is dynamically enhanced by inertia .",
    "it is the electromagnetic field that generates the relativistic particles in radio jets so , even if their total energies evolve to become comparable , the magnetic energy comes first and drives the whole phenomenon .",
    "while this paper is concerned with jets from systems with accretion disks , the jets near pulsars are probably closely related . there",
    "the magnetic field is rotated by the neutron star but the weaker field at large radii may be heavily loaded by the inertia close to the light cylinder .",
    "field lines may be twisted from below far faster than they can rotate across the light cylinder .",
    "the resulting twisting up of the field within the cylinder may result in jet phenomena with similarities to those described here .",
    "the problem of jet collimation was emphasised by wheeler ( 1971 ) at the vatican conference on the nuclei of galaxies in 1970 .",
    "he drew attention to the computations of leblanc & wilson ( 1970 ) who found a remarkable jet generated on the axis of a rotating star in collapse .",
    "this may be hailed as the first gamma - ray burst calculation and the magnetic cavities discussed here are in essence analytic calculations based on the same mechanism .",
    "we have concentrated on the simplest case of force - free magnetic fields within the cavity . in earlier work others produced good collimation by twisting up a magnetic field that was imposed from infinity .",
    "an early paper on this was by lovelace ( 1976 ) and the rather successful simulations of shibata & uchida ( 1985 , 1986 ) are based on this theme .",
    "i consider that the imposition of a straight field from infinity ducks the question of why collimation exists .",
    "the straight field imposes it .",
    "much work has concentrated on the hard problem of winds carrying a significant mass flux from a rotating star .",
    "this subject is well covered in mestel s book ( 1999 ) li et al ( 2001 ) , lovelace et al ( 2002 ) and sakarai ( 1987 ) found a weak asymptotic collimation and heyvaerts & norman ( 2002 ) have recently concluded a thorough study of the asymptotics of wind collimation .",
    "bogovalov & tsinganos ( 2003 ) have tackled the difficulties of collimating mass loaded flows from central objects and give models with the near - axis part of the flow well collimated despite the centrifugal force .",
    "blandford & payne ( 1982 ) discuss winds launched by centrifugal force .",
    "lovelace & romanova ( 2003 ) li et al ( 2006 ) made numerical calculations based upon the differential winding we proposed in papers i & ii .",
    "the stability problems of twisted jets have been tackled in both the linear and non - linear regimes by appl , lery & baty ( 2000 ) and lery , baty & appl ( 2000 ) while thompson , lyutikov and kulkarni ( 2002 ) have applied to magnetars the self - similar fields found in paper i. in section 5 we find that some magnetic cavities float upwards like bubbles thus fulfilling the ideas of gull & northover ( 1976 ) .",
    "the laboratory experiments of lebedev et al .",
    "( 2005 ) give some support for the type of models given here .",
    "a fine review of extragalactic jets was given by begelman et al .",
    "see also the more recent work of pudritz et al 2006 , ouyed et al 2003 .",
    "this is the fourth paper of this series and puts a new emphasis on regions in which the ambient pressure decreases with height like @xmath6 .",
    "it also gives detailed analytical solutions of the @xmath23 problem for the first time .",
    "papers ii and iii concentrated on why there are collimated jets at all . here",
    "we concentrate on the dynamic magnetic configurations generated .",
    "( lynden - bell & boily 1994 ) showed that when an inner disk was rotated by @xmath24 degrees relative to an outer disk field lines that had connected them splayed out to infinity in the absence of any confining external pressure . at greater angles",
    "there was no torque as the inner and outer disks were magnetically disconnected .",
    "paper ii ( lynden - bell 1996 ) demonstrated that inclusion of a weak uniform external pressure led to a strong collimation after many turns with the magnetic field creating towers with jet - like cores whose height grew with each turn .",
    "again the inner disk was rotated rigidly relative to the outer disk .",
    "paper iii ( lynden - bell 2003 ) was a refined version of a conference paper ( lynden - bell 2001 ) . in these",
    "the differential rotation of the accretion disk and external pressure variation with height were included and the shape of the magnetic cavity was calculated as a function of time .",
    "however the fields were not calculated in detail and the treatment used a static external pressure which was assumed to fall less rapidly than @xmath6 .",
    "in this paper iv we show that these quasi - static models are actually dynamically correct provided that the motions generated in the field lines by the twisting of the accretion disk never become relativistic , but we then explore the consequences of the magnetic cavity expanding into a region where the pressure variation approaches @xmath6 .",
    "this results in a dramatic acceleration of the top of the magnetic cavity along a cone whose angle gradually narrows at greater distances .",
    "the sudden expansion out to infinity when the twist exceeded a critical angle , found in paper i when there was no confining medium , is still present in modified form when beyond some height the external ambient pressure falls as @xmath6 or faster ; once the field has penetrated to that region there is no longer a quasi - static configuration for the system to go to , so the jet accelerates to reach either dynamic ram - pressure balance whenever the background density falls less fast than @xmath25 or failing that relativistic speeds .      in the standard mhd approximation",
    "the displacement current is neglected so curl@xmath26 . if the magnetic field dominates over any other pressure or inertial forces , then , neglecting those ,",
    "the magnetic force density has nothing to oppose it , so @xmath27 and we deduce that the currents flow along the lines of force .",
    "this implies that @xmath28 and as both div@xmath29 and div@xmath30 are zero @xmath31 is constant along the lines of force .",
    "we shall be considering problems with the normal component of magnetic field specified on an accretion disk at @xmath2 and the field does not penetrate the other boundary where an external pressure @xmath0 balances @xmath32 .",
    "the past motion of the accretion disk has produced a twist in the field - lines which emerge from the disk and return thereto further out .",
    "those with past experience will know that the above conditions supplemented by expressions for @xmath33 on the disk , the twists @xmath34 on each line and @xmath0 , serve to define the problem , so the magnetic field is then determined .",
    "the other maxwell equations curl@xmath35 , and that giving div@xmath36 , are not needed in the determination of the magnetic field .",
    "notice that all the equations used to find the magnetic field do not involve the time .",
    "thus if we specify the twist angles together with the normal field component on the disk and the boundary pressure @xmath0 at any time , the whole field configuration at that time is determined .",
    "now let us suppose that we know how to solve this static problem but that @xmath37 and @xmath0 are continuously specified as functions of time .",
    "then the solution for the magnetic field in this dynamic problem is found by merely taking the sequence of static problems parameterised by @xmath38 .",
    "such a procedure will give us @xmath39 but in the dynamic problem the motions of the lines of magnetic force generate electric fields that must be found also .",
    "however these can be found almost as an afterthought because we can determine how the lines of force move and their motion is the @xmath40 drift . assuming perfect conductivity there is no component of @xmath36 along @xmath29 so @xmath41 .",
    "our knowledge of @xmath42 on the accretion disk tells us how the lines move everywhere , which in turn tells us the electric field .",
    "we conclude that the crux of the problem lies not in difficult and dangerous dynamics but in the staid simplicity and safety of statics .",
    "that said we need whole sequences of static solutions that allow us to turn up the twists and parameterise the external pressures .",
    "even the static problem is no walkover and we would have found it impossible to get general solutions were it not for the energy principle that the magnetic field adopts the configuration of minimum energy subject to the flux , twist and pressure constraints imposed at the boundary .",
    "here we have already demonstrated why an evolution of the magnetic field structure through quasi - static models gives the solution to the dynamic problem .",
    "section 2 details the specification of the relevant static problem and the methods of solving it . in section 3",
    "we solve it developing further the approximate method of paper iii .",
    "this gives us the mean fields within magnetic cavities whose shapes we calculate for any prescribed external pressure distribution .",
    "emphasis is placed on solutions that access regions with @xmath43 falling like @xmath6 and the very fast expansions then generated .",
    "we then generalise our results to allow for a dynamic ram - pressure and discover the shapes of inertially confined jets . in section 4",
    "we calculate the detailed magnetic fields within the cavity .",
    "section 5 finds the electric fields generated as the magnetic cavity grows and categorises the types of solution .",
    "section 6 gives exact solutions of special cases with the dynamical electric field also calculated .",
    "a magnetic flux @xmath44 rises out of an accretion disk on @xmath2 at radii up to @xmath45 .",
    "the lines of magnetic force on a tube encircling the flux @xmath46 eventually return to the disk at an outer radius @xmath47 after a total twist around the axis of @xmath48 .",
    "the magnetic field above the disc is force free with current flowing along the field lines and there is negligible gas pressure within the magnetic - field - dominated cavity .",
    "however the magnetic cavity is bounded by a surface at which an external pressure @xmath0 is specified .",
    "later we shall consider the case of a dynamical pressure @xmath49 .",
    "our problem is to find the magnetic field and the shape of the cavity containing it when the functions @xmath50 and @xmath0 are specified .",
    "axial symmetry is assumed .",
    "we think of @xmath34 as due to the disk s past differential rotation and sometimes write @xmath51t=\\omega(p)t$ ] where the suffix @xmath52 refers to the rotation of the disk itself .",
    "the equation div@xmath53 implies that the magnetic field components in cylindrical polar coordinates @xmath54 may be written in terms of the flux function @xmath55 which gives the flux through a ring of radius @xmath56 at height @xmath57 , and the gradient of the azimuthal coordinate @xmath58 , in the form , @xmath59 the force - free condition @xmath60curl@xmath61 then tells us that @xmath62 takes the form , @xmath63 the function @xmath64 is constant along each field line ( so it is a function of p ) and must be determined from the solution so that the total twist on that field line is @xmath48 .",
    "finally the azimuthal component of the force free condition yields the equation @xmath65 this is to be solved within an unknown surface s given by @xmath66 in which the field lies and on which @xmath67 .",
    "the difficulties of this problem are :    - the equation is non - linear    - the function @xmath64 in it is not known and can only be determined from @xmath48 via the solution .    - the bounding surface s is unknown .",
    "luckily there is a different way of tackling these magnetostatic problems .",
    "the energy of the magnetic field and of the external gas - pressure must be a minimum subject to the flux and twist conditions on the accretion disk .",
    "the pressure energy stored in making a cavity whose area at height @xmath57 is @xmath68 against an external pressure @xmath0 is @xmath69 the energy principle that applies even outside axial symmetry is that @xmath70 must be a minimum , where @xmath71dz,\\ ] ] and @xmath29 satisfies the flux and twist conditions on @xmath2 .",
    "two exact theorems follow ; they were proved in paper iii by expanding a horizontal slice through the configuration first vertically and then horizontally .",
    "earlier more specialised versions appeared in papers i and ii . these theorems are true even without axial symmetry . defining averages @xmath72 over a horizontal plane at height @xmath57 , @xmath73^{-1}\\int_z a(z')[dp / dz']dz'\\right);\\ ] ] the",
    "final integral from @xmath57 up is negative whenever pressure falls at height .",
    "minimum energy for horizontal displacements of the slice gives , @xmath74 where @xmath75 and the integration is over the plane at height @xmath57 .",
    "we shall show presently that after much twisting the magnetic configuration becomes very tall as compared to its width .",
    "as no extra radial flux is created the radial field lines become widely spread out over the height of the resultant tower and the gradients with height likewise become small . when we neglect terms involving @xmath76 equation ( [ 7 ] ) becomes @xmath77 and with a similar neglect in the use of equation ( [ 6 ] )",
    "we find @xmath78 where we have defined a dimensionless s ( positive when pressure falls at greater height ) by , @xmath79.\\ ] ] notice that @xmath80 for the constant pressure case and that @xmath81 is the constant @xmath82 when @xmath83 the cross sectional area varies as a power of @xmath43 .",
    "two possible approaches to solving this problem are :    i. forwards method    we use the energy variational principle choosing such simple trial functions that the boundary conditions can be applied and the resulting variational equations can be solved .",
    "we can then solve the problem for all choices of the prescribed functions @xmath50 and @xmath0 but the accuracy of the solution is limited by the imposed form of the trial function .",
    "\\ii . backwards method    here we solve the exact equation ( [ 3 ] ) but make special choices of @xmath84 and of the surface s so that we can solve the problem .",
    "once we have the solution we discover the functions @xmath85 and @xmath0 for which we have the solution . while this method is limited to a very few special cases , at least for them the solutions are exact",
    "this enables us to check the accuracy and the validity of the more general solutions given by the forwards method .",
    "this method was developed in paper iii and with an extremely crude but instructive trial function it was used in paper ii .",
    "there we showed that if each field line turned n times around the axis and the magnetic cavity was taken as a cylinder of height @xmath86 and radius @xmath56 then , if the total uprising poloidal flux was @xmath87 , very crude estimates of the field components are : @xmath88 . squaring these estimates , adding the external pressure @xmath43 and multiplying by the volume @xmath89 we find @xmath90 $ ] where @xmath43 is assumed independent of @xmath57 .",
    "minimising over @xmath56 gives @xmath91 so r is determined by the external pressure and the flux . with this result",
    "the final round bracket in @xmath70 reduces to @xmath92 and minimising @xmath70 over all @xmath86 we find @xmath93 which shows a remarkable collimation which improves with every turn !    the method of paper iii involved a much improved trial function which allows each field line , @xmath46 , to attain whatever maximum height , @xmath94 it likes , allows for the different total twists @xmath48 of the different field lines and properly accounts for the variation of external pressure with height . because of the great heights of the magnetic towers generated after many turns , most of the field energy is high above the accretion disk and the detailed distribution of the flux in @xmath1 no longer plays a part in the distant field . at each height , z , mean fields are defined by @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the radius of the magnetic cavity at height @xmath57 , and @xmath97 .",
    "also @xmath98 the last expression arises because @xmath46 is zero at both @xmath99 and @xmath100 and achieves its maximum @xmath101 at an intermediate point .",
    "we also define @xmath102 and @xmath103 although @xmath104 and @xmath105 are in principle functions of height , for tall towers we expect them to settle down to some typical values which we determine later . in what follows",
    "we neglect any variation of j with height ; variation of i does not change the result .",
    "we now explain the basis of the trial function used .",
    "if a poloidal flux @xmath106 is twisted once around the axis , it generates a toroidal flux @xmath106 . if its twist is @xmath48 the toroidal flux generated is @xmath107 .",
    "first consider distributing this toroidal flux uniformly over the height @xmath94 to which this field line reaches as was done in paper iii . unlike the use of @xmath86 in the crude calculation in its new meaning it depends on the @xmath46 of the field line . in a small height interval",
    "@xmath108 the element of flux @xmath106 contributes a toroidal flux @xmath109^{-1}\\phi(p)dpdz$ ] whenever the height is less than @xmath94 .",
    "the total toroidal flux through @xmath108 is contributed by all lines of force that reach above that height ; that is by those with @xmath110 , where @xmath101 is the maximum value that @xmath46 achieves at height @xmath57 .",
    "hence there is a toroidal flux through the area @xmath111 of    @xmath112 @xmath48 is specified in terms of the accretion disk s twist .",
    "@xmath94 is to be varied .",
    "however while this makes a possible trial function it is not generally true that the flux is so distributed . indeed in the limiting case of the exact self - similar solutions discussed in the next paper the twist is strongly concentrated toward the top of each field line .",
    "the extreme alternative is found by putting all the twist at the top of each field line .",
    "then the toroidal flux in any height increment @xmath108 depends on the twist of those field lines whose tops lie in @xmath108 so @xmath113 .",
    "however the truth must lie between the extremes of uniform twist and all twist at the top of each line . we therefore take the geometric mean of these two expressions for the toroidal flux distribution and obtain : @xmath114^{1/2}.\\ ] ] now @xmath94 is in the variational principle and @xmath101 has the property that @xmath115=p$ ] , so @xmath116 is the functional inverse of @xmath94 ; so whenever @xmath94 is varied @xmath101 automatically varies in concert .",
    "we now omit the @xmath117 term in the energy principle as it is much smaller than the others once the towers grow tall , cf the crude estimate above equation ( [ 12 ] ) . writing @xmath70 in terms of the expressions discussed above @xmath118dz\\ ] ] varying @xmath68 gives @xmath119 which using ( [ 13 ] ) and ( [ 14 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath120 , as found in equation ( [ 9 ] ) . putting this expression back into equation(17 ) we find that the last two terms there combine to make @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "we now integrate both terms in @xmath70 by parts and then rename the dummy variables in the integrals that result from the first term ; these operations give @xmath123\\int_{p_m}^f\\phi ( p)dpdp_m+\\int_0^f\\pi dp_m,\\ ] ] where @xmath124 is merely @xmath125 re - expressed as a function of @xmath116 @xmath126 most remarkably our adopted geometric mean between the uniform twist and top- twist cases has resulted in a @xmath70 of precisely the form obtained in the uniform twist case of paper iii except that the first term is now exactly half of its former value . since this clearly reduces @xmath70 the new trial function is clearly better than the old in that it brings us closer to the true minimum .",
    "minimising @xmath70 over all choices of @xmath127 we find from ( [ 19 ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) @xmath128p_m\\overline \\phi(p_m)^2\\ ] ] where @xmath129 equation ( [ 21 ] ) gives the function @xmath127 and its inverse @xmath101 in terms of the given @xmath0 and @xmath48 . in line with section two s introduction",
    "we write @xmath130 and @xmath131 . from equation",
    "( 21 ) we notice that as a result of this @xmath38 dependence @xmath132 and @xmath86 grow with @xmath38 at each value of @xmath116 .",
    "this growth is at constant velocity if the external pressure is independent of height .",
    "however if that pressure falls off with height the velocity @xmath133 accelerates .",
    "e.g. if @xmath134 with @xmath135 then @xmath86 has nearly constant velocity until it reaches @xmath136 but at greater heights it behaves as @xmath137 with constant acceleration .",
    "the shape of the magnetic cavity at each moment is given by plotting @xmath86 against @xmath138 .",
    "we find the relationship by substituting @xmath116 from equation ( 18 ) into equation ( 21 ) to give the equation for @xmath86 as a function of @xmath139 .",

    ". however @xmath0 should not decrease too fast else equation ( [ 21 ] ) will not have a sensible solution . to understand this we see from equation ( [ 22 ] ) that @xmath143 decreases as @xmath116 increases since the twist @xmath144 is greatest for the field lines rising nearest the centre of the disk .",
    "also @xmath116 decreases at greater heights since less magnetic flux reaches there .",

    "we would have @xmath399 ; from ( 11 ) this formula leads directly to @xmath400 and equation ( [ 37 ] ) gives us the simple relationship @xmath401 in place of equation ( [ 58 ] ) , nevertheless these equations with s constant imply that @xmath43 vanishes , or becomes infinite , when the area @xmath83 vanishes , which will not be true .",
    "the exactly separable case is too restrictive near the top when the pressure varies .",

    "we first calculate the velocity of our field lines . on the accretion disk",
    "this velocity is that of the disk itself so the field line which initially intersected the disk at azimuth @xmath403 now has its outer intersection at @xmath47 at azimuth @xmath404 .",

    "the field line obeys equation ( [ 57 ] ) so on integrating the second equality there @xmath406 where we have written @xmath407 for @xmath48 and @xmath408 .",
    "both integrations @xmath108 are to be performed with @xmath409 varying so as to keep @xmath46 constant .",

    "it is better to convert those @xmath411integrations into integrations over @xmath409 , in which @xmath410 is single valued , rather than @xmath57 .",
    "such a conversion yields @xmath412 , where we have written @xmath413 for @xmath116 to demonstrate that the @xmath285 dependence arises through @xmath288 when @xmath46 is held fixed . the angular rotation rate of the intersection of this field line with a @xmath405const plane is @xmath414 @xmath415 arises from two causes i ) any explicit dependence of @xmath416 on @xmath38 that does not cancel between numerator and denominator in @xmath410 , ii ) the change in the lower end point @xmath285 of the numerator s integration . at constant @xmath46 and @xmath57",
    "we have @xmath417 , which gives us the rate of change of the lower limit of the numerator . when @xmath418 is either a power or constant the explicit dependence of @xmath416 on @xmath38 cancels between numerator and denominator so there is then no contribution from i ) .",
    "of course had we left @xmath410 as a @xmath57-integration there would have been no contribution from the end point but then the contribution from the @xmath38-dependence of the @xmath285 in the integrand must be re - expressed as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath57 via @xmath419 , is unwieldy .",
    "now @xmath420 at constant @xmath57 is not the @xmath58-component of the velocity of the line of force but the velocity of the point of intersection of the line with the @xmath57=const plane .",
    "when the line of force is only slightly inclined to the plane the difference is obvious since the velocity of the line is perpendicular to the line .",
    "a little thought shows that in the intersection velocity the component of the velocity of the line in the @xmath57-plane parallel to the projection of the field into the plane is exaggerated by the factor @xmath421 relative to that component of the field line s velocity . thus writing hats for unit vectors and @xmath422 for the unit vector @xmath423 in the @xmath57-plane considered and @xmath424 for the component of the field line s velocity in that plane , the velocity of the intersection is @xmath425({\\bf",

    "the component of this intersection s velocity along @xmath426 is @xmath427 now by faraday s law , the rate of change of the magnetic flux through a circle about the axis in the plane considered gives the emf so @xmath428 this is a second equation for @xmath42 and the third is just @xmath429 . eliminating first @xmath430 and",
    "then @xmath431 we find @xmath432r\\dot\\phi+[b_rb_\\phi/(b^2b_z)]\\dot p$ ] .",
    "the other components are readily found from equations ( [ 61 ] ) & ( [ 62 ] ) .",
    "the remaining components of @xmath36 follow from @xmath433 . like the electric fields on the accretion disk these fields are not far from cylindrically radial and directed away from the surface of greatest flux , @xmath46 , at each height .",
    "we now turn our attention to categorising the different types of solutions .",
    "a helium balloon needs a tether in tension if it is not to rise further .",
    "a water tank needs a support in compression if it is not to fall . if we cut a magnetic tower by a horizontal plane",
    "there is net tension across that plane due to the magnetic stresses if @xmath434 and net compression if that quantity is negative .",
    "we call these floaters or pushers respectively if they satisfy those criteria low down the tower .",
    "floaters are are held down by magnetic tension ; pushers are supported from the bottom by a net magnetic pressure . in the tall tower approximation",
    "the above criterion simplifies to @xmath435 for a floater . comparing this criterion with equations ( [ 10 ] ) and",
    "( [ 42 ] ) we see floaters have @xmath436 and cavities whose radii increase at greater heights while pushers have @xmath437 , @xmath438 and @xmath439 .",
    "their cavities radii decrease with height . in a constant pressure medium",
    "all the solutions are pushers .",
    "if the pressure in a long narrow column supporting a weight is greater than the ambient pressure in the medium surrounding the column then any lateral bend bowing the column will be exaggerated as in the euler strut problem .",
    "all our magnetic towers are stable against that bowing as their net support is atmospheric or less @xmath440 .",
    "this criterion corresponds to @xmath441 .",
    "thus squirmers do not occur in the magnetostatics of our systems which have pressure that decreases with height .",
    "here we postulate the forms of @xmath84 and of the bounding surface s for which we can solve the differential equation ( [ 3 ] ) .",
    "after we have solved it we discover what problem we have solved by finding @xmath0 on the bounding surface and the twist angles @xmath48 and the boundary flux @xmath1 .",
    "the differential operator on the left of equation ( [ 3 ] ) separates in oblate or prolate spheroidal and rotational parabolic coordinates as well as in cylindrical and spherical polars .",
    "it is therefore important to take the surface s to be one of those coordinate surfaces . even after choosing one of those the problem is still non - linear",
    "; but there are interesting exceptions .",
    "we have already seen that the case @xmath442const",
    ". corresponds to a constant external pressure and it gives a linear but inhomogeneous equation .",
    "a second simple case is @xmath443 .",
    "this linear case is well known and much explored but is somewhat less interesting than the @xmath444 case .",
    "the combination @xmath445 though soluble has the idiosyncrasies of both the former cases without obvious advantages .",
    "a different approach with more interesting solutions is to accept the non - linear behaviour of equation ( [ 3 ] ) and look for self - similar solutions .",
    "most of the above methods can be generalised using perturbation theory .",
    "for example if the bounding surface is a ` cylinder ' of slowly varying radius @xmath96 one can solve the problem in terms of the scaled radius @xmath446 as in section 4 .",
    "writing equation ( [ 3 ] ) in spherical polar coordinates @xmath447 and setting @xmath448 we find @xmath449 self - similar solutions only occur when @xmath450 .",
    "if we now set @xmath451 then the left hand side is @xmath452 times a function of @xmath453 so @xmath454 which is a function of such a product , must equal such a product . hence @xmath455 .",
    "thus with @xmath456 the @xmath452 cancels out and writing @xmath457 , where @xmath458 is the maximum value of @xmath9 @xmath459 this is a version of the equation of lynden - bell and boily ( paper 1 ) for whom the case with @xmath198 small was of especial interest .    to make contact with the work of section 4 we remark that for narrow jets it is only necessary to consider @xmath453 close to one .",
    "supposing the walls at @xmath460 , we write @xmath461 , where both @xmath462 and @xmath463 are small , the equation takes the form @xmath464 we have approximated @xmath465 as @xmath466 , which is good to 1 per cent or better for opening angles of less than 23 degrees .",
    "when the @xmath467 is neglected this equation will be recognised as equation ( [ 38 ] ) of section 3 .",
    "the particular solutions of equation ( [ 64 ] ) to which we now turn are so simple that we obtain them without making this narrow cone approximation .",
    "unexpectedly we shall use spherical polar coordinates centred at the top of the tower - like magnetic cavity at @xmath468 .",
    "this use of @xmath86 is similar to the very crude description as a cylindrical tower in the introduction but now the tower will be conical pointing down at the accretion disk .",
    "this @xmath86 corresponds to @xmath222 in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "we measure @xmath469 from the downward axis pointing toward the centre of the accretion disk ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "we solve the force free equations within the downward opening cone cos@xmath470 which forms a dunce s cap configuration over the accretion disk .",
    "we take @xmath471 which corresponds to our @xmath472 behaviour appropriate for a constant pressure .",
    "equation ( [ 64 ] ) becomes @xmath473 .",

    "while @xmath490 is zero at both boundaries @xmath491 is zero only at the outer one .",
    "@xmath492 passes through zero at an internal point",
    ". see text for the surprising behaviour near @xmath493    [ fig7 ]    the constant @xmath494 is determined by the external pressure @xmath495^{1/2}$ ] . near the axis",
    "these fields have precisely the same behaviour as those we found in equations ( [ 49 ] ) and ( [ 50 ] ) .",
    "however the fields are in one sense even more interesting ; they are all independent of @xmath488 , the distance from the origin . by construction @xmath496",
    "vanish at the edge of the cone but @xmath492 is constant along its generators all the way up to the origin .",
    "the origin itself is then a point at which the infinite field coming up the axis turns back and splays out down these generators at constant field strength .",
    "this is the way the constant external pressure is opposed . with the origin such a remarkable point",
    ", some may suspect that the forces do not balance there , that the whole configuration might be held up by some sky - hook pulling at the apex .",
    "however @xmath46 varies as @xmath497 and the maxwell stresses integrated over horizontal cuts through the cone give a net force that vanishes like @xmath497 as the origin is approached .",
    "thus no sky hook is necessary to balance forces at the origin .",
    "the radial fields reverse at an intermediate value @xmath498 ( for narrow cones ) and some may suspect reconnection there but the @xmath62 field component maximises at that value of theta so there is plenty of magnetic pressure to prevent reconnection . with @xmath499 close to one the radii on the accretion disk",
    "are @xmath500 so the flux coming up within a circle of radius @xmath56 is @xmath501 $ ] .",
    "the twist function @xmath48 is given by integration along field lines which is simple for this self - similar field .",
    "@xmath502 yields on writing @xmath503 @xmath504,\\ ] ] where the integral is evaluated between foot points at @xmath505 of the field line and @xmath506 .",
    "therefore @xmath507 are the roots for @xmath11 of @xmath508 when the inner foot is much further in than the outer foot then @xmath509 so then @xmath155 is close to @xmath510 .",
    "this allows us to estimate the angular velocity of the accretion disk required . in the central parts it behaves as @xmath511^{-1/2}$ ] , so the circular velocity of the disk is almost constant but drops to zero at the very centre like @xmath512^{-1/2}$ ] . from equation (",
    "[ 69 ] ) both roots @xmath507 are independent of time . hence from equation ( [ 68 ] ) @xmath513 as expected from section 4 so we may write @xmath514 . writing our solution for p in terms of cylindrical polar coordinates now centred on the centre of the disk , @xmath515 , where @xmath516 for @xmath517 and it is just the dependence of @xmath86 on time that generates the evolution of the system .",
    "@xmath518 with @xmath48 given by equation ( [ 69 ] ) .",
    "the magnetic fields are given by equation ( [ 67 ] ) so we now calculate the electric fields following the method of section 5 .",
    "the simplicity of the expression for @xmath46 means that @xmath410 is simpler and in place of equation ( [ 60 ] ) we have @xmath519 .",
    "now @xmath520 so @xmath521 . at fixed height",

    "notice that the meridional field velocity @xmath527 is not perpendicular to the vector meridional component of the magnetic field .",
    "it is the full vector velocity that is perpendicular to the complete magnetic field .",
    "we have explored the dunce s cap model in all this detail both to demonstrate its interesting field structure and to show how we get the fields in an explicit example .",
    "figure 5 gives the poloidal structure of the magnetic fields which wind around these surfaces of constant flux .",
    "it is very remarkable that these simple analytic methods allow the solution of these highly non - linear problems with variable domain , not just for a few special cases but for all twist functions omega and all pressure distributions .",
    "furthermore we get time - dependent solutions for all time .",
    "the main secret lies in the variational principle coupled with a good form of trial function .",
    "once the time - dependence becomes relativistic we lose this tool so the problems will become harder .",
    "however when the relativistic motion is only important for the rotation it is likely that another variational principle may exist .",
    "an important problem is to seek it out . in the foregoing",
    "we have explored the simplest case in which the magnetic cavity is empty and the poynting flux carries both the energy and the momentum of the jet .",
    "i believe that the results justify the assertion that this simplest case has remarkable similarities to the observed world and this suggests that the extra complication of material winds is not essential to explaining the main phenomena . however especially for pulsars relativistic rotation is an essential ingredient of the problem not covered here .",

    "there should be only only maximum of @xmath288 between the end points .",
    "we rewrite the equation in the form @xmath529 where @xmath530 we shall be particularly interested in the strongly non - linear case with @xmath308 large ( @xmath198 small ) so we start with @xmath308 large but later extend the technique down to @xmath531 . as we shall come across several variants of essentially the same problem we describe the technique in terms of the more general problem in which [ a2 ] is replaced by @xmath532 ^ 2\\ ] ] with @xmath533 zero when @xmath288 reaches its maximum of 1 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath534 depends on parameters such at @xmath308 or @xmath304 in ( [ a1 ] ) and that we are primarily interested in the solution when @xmath308 is large in which case @xmath535 is strongly peaked close to @xmath305 and away from there it is small .",
    "under these conditions ( which hold for ( [ a1 ] ) ) most of the deceleration @xmath536 of @xmath288 occurs in the region in which @xmath288 is close to one .",
    "let that maximum be at @xmath537 . then at @xmath538 @xmath539_1= -g~{\\rm say}\\ ] ] where @xmath540 .",
    "near @xmath537 @xmath541 and @xmath542 so @xmath543 @xmath544 where @xmath545 and @xmath546 at @xmath538 .",
    "writing ( [ a8 ] ) as a cubic leads to simpler mathematics later .",
    "near @xmath537 where most of the ` deceleration ' of @xmath288 takes place we see from ( [ a4 ] ) that @xmath547 we have derived this equation near @xmath537 but away from there @xmath548 is small and as @xmath549 is small and @xmath550 is not near zero , the equation can be taken to hold everywhere .",
    "we now integrate ( [ a10 ] ) and remembering that @xmath551 is zero at @xmath538 we find @xmath552 it was to get this simple result that we chose the cubic form in ( [ a8 ] ) . taking the square root and multiplying up by @xmath553 we find @xmath554 to proceed further",
    "we must integrate @xmath555 .",
    "as the major item in ( [ a1 ] ) is @xmath556 we shall assume that near the maximum of @xmath288 , @xmath557 can be approximated as @xmath558 .",
    "we do this by taking @xmath559/d\\ln f]_{f=1}\\ ] ] and @xmath560 we now use the method of paper i to give us @xmath561 for large @xmath562 .    set @xmath563 .",

    "we must impose the boundary conditions and so find the value of @xmath304 needed to make @xmath288 one at its maximum .",
    "however the boundaries vary from one application to another so it is time to consider the differential equations and their ranges one by one .      to use the general theory above for this equation we write @xmath285 for @xmath453 and @xmath572 , @xmath573 and @xmath574 the boundaries are at @xmath321 and @xmath322 and @xmath575 , @xmath576 .",
    "at those boundaries we need @xmath577 so that @xmath320 .",
    "if @xmath578 is the positive value of @xmath568 satisfying this then the negative solution is @xmath579 so at @xmath322 and @xmath321 respectively @xmath580          now @xmath587 or more accurately @xmath588 so the quantity on the right is @xmath589 which is small so @xmath298 is nearly a half .",
    "accurately @xmath590\\ ] ] with @xmath298 known @xmath591 this completes the solution when @xmath308 is large @xmath592\\}\\right\\}\\right\\}\\ ] ]      when @xmath308 is lowered the solution will still have a single hump and will still fall to zero at the end points but it will no longer have precisely the form given in ( [ a15]),([a16 ] ) because there will be more deceleration of @xmath288 away from @xmath537 where our approximations for @xmath593 and @xmath534 are no longer valid . to allow for this",
    "we generalise the form of ( [ a16 ] ) and ( [ a17 ] ) to @xmath594 @xmath595 where @xmath596 and @xmath226 can now be different and only for @xmath308 large will they become equal to @xmath308 .",
    "furthermore @xmath389 is no longer restricted to the form it took previously in terms of @xmath597 and @xmath304 .",
    "we show in this section that with the four parameters @xmath598 and @xmath538 we can ensure that the solution has the right position of the maximum , the right deceleration there and that the gradients of the solution at the end points are appropriate for the differential equation .",
    "since the desired solution has just one hump and is zero at the end points it is no surprise that we can fit it well not only for @xmath308 large but for @xmath599 . in practice we find errors from computed solutions are less than 1% rising above 2% for @xmath392 .",
    "since @xmath304 is itself to be determined from the fitting of boundary conditions in the original equation we have actually five constants @xmath600 and @xmath538 to be determined so we impose the following five conditions on our proposed form of solution a @xmath601 @xmath602 as we wish our proposed solution to solve ( [ a4 ] ) as nearly as possible we now integrate ( [ a4 ] ) by parts first from @xmath538 to 1 and then from the lower boundary @xmath499 to @xmath538 .",

    "we then perform the integrals , so ( [ a22])([a25 ] ) provide us with the five equations to determine our five parameters .",
    "we wrote ( [ a26 ] ) in that form because in the application to narrow jets @xmath608 is linear so that the integrals are readily performed using @xmath568 as the variable of integration .",
    "for that case the integral involved is      applying these methods to the solution of equation ( [ 38 ] ) , with @xmath285 written for @xmath453 and @xmath611 and boundaries at @xmath321 and @xmath322 the five equations are with @xmath612 @xmath613 @xmath614 @xmath615 and from ( [ a24 ] ) and ( [ a25 ] ) @xmath616+\\frac{\\lambda_1}{1+\\delta } -\\frac{\\delta}{1-\\delta^2 } \\ln \\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{1-e^{-2h}}}{1+\\delta\\sqrt{1-e^{-2h}}}\\right)\\right\\}\\ ] ] @xmath617 in solving these one uses the sum and differences of ( [ 29 ] ) and ( [ 30 ] ) and thinks of @xmath596 rather than @xmath308 as the independent variable .",
