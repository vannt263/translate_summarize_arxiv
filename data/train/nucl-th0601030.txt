    "observation of neutron star properties such as mass , size and temperature provides us with important clues to the understanding of the state of matter at extremely high densities . in the 1970 s ,",
    "the maximum mass of the neutron star was calculated with the @xmath1 potentials available at that time @xcite and mean field models @xcite .",
    "most of the calculations done in the 1970 s resulted in stiff equations of state , and thus the maximum mass of a neutron star was predicted to be larger than @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the solar mass . only the reid soft core potential yielded a soft equation of state and consequently a small maximum mass of a neutron star , @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "recent observations of the masses of binary pulsars @xcite , which are candidates of neutron stars indicate that the maximum mass of neutron stars are roughly around @xmath5 , substantially smaller than most of the predicted values in the 1970 s .",
    "( however , very recent observations seem to suggest possible existence of more massive pulsars in the range @xmath6 @xcite , though further confirmation is needed . ) on the other hand , exotic forms of matter , i.e. , matter consisting of degrees of freedom other than the nucleons have been proposed already many years ago .",
    "some of the proposed exotic states of matter include those with creation of hyperons @xcite , bose - einstein condensation ( pions @xcite or kaons @xcite ) , strange matter @xcite , and quark deconfinement @xcite .",
    "these exotic states seem to reduce the maximum mass of a neutron star close to the observations @xcite , implying that exotic degrees of freedom seem to be needed to reproduce the observed masses of neutron stars .    in this work",
    ", we consider the strangeness degrees of freedom by including both hyperon creation and kaon condensation in the neutron star matter .",
    "( it is the anti - kaon that matters here , but we simply refer to both kaons and anti - kaons as kaons for brevity . ) the masses and energies of the hyperons and kaons in medium are sensitive to their interactions with the surrounding matter . in the meson - exchange picture , meson - hyperon and meson - kaon coupling constants can fix the strength of these interactions .",
    "the meson - hyperon coupling constants may be determined from the binding energies of hyperons in hypernuclei .",
    "the meson - kaon coupling constants have been studied by using the kaon - nucleon scattering @xcite and kaonic atom data @xcite .",
    "recently , the magnitudes of the kaon - nucleus potential in matter have attracted much attention .",
    "some calculations @xcite show that the real part of the @xmath7-nucleus optical potential @xmath8 is shallow ( @xmath9 @xmath1050 mev ) , but some other calculations suggest that @xmath8 can be as large as about @xmath11 mev @xcite or even close to @xmath12 mev @xcite .",
    "akaishi and yamazaki predicted possible existence of deeply bound kaonic nuclei @xcite , in which @xmath8 at normal density @xmath13 was estimated to be about @xmath11 mev .",
    "then , experiments at kek claimed the observation of tribaryon kaonic nuclei , s@xmath14 @xcite and s@xmath15 @xcite , which seem to suggest that @xmath7 may be even more deeply bound than the theoretical prediction @xcite ( the former claim @xcite , however , was withdrawn by the experimental group @xcite ) .",
    "finuda collaboration at da@xmath16ne @xcite and a bnl experiment with @xmath17 reaction @xcite also reported distinct peaks .",
    "more recently there was a theoretical work which considered large kaonic binding energies and calculated widths of kaonic nuclear bound states @xcite .",
    "the identities of these experimental peaks need to be studied further experimentally and theoretically .",
    "however , in this work , we consider the possibility of deep optical potential of kaons in nuclei and explore the consequences in the composition profile of neutron star matter .    in this work ,",
    "for the description of dense matter we employ the modified quark - meson coupling ( mqmc ) model @xcite .",
    "nucleons and hyperons in the baryon octet are treated as mit bags .",
    "the bag constant @xmath18 and phenomenological constant @xmath19 for a baryon @xmath20 are fixed to reproduce the free mass of each baryon @xmath20 .",
    "coupling constants between ( @xmath21 , @xmath22)-quarks in the bags and ( @xmath23 , @xmath0 , @xmath24)-mesons are adjusted to give us the binding energy per a nucleon @xmath25 mev and symmetry energy @xmath26 mev at the saturation density @xmath27 . since the interaction between the @xmath28-quark and mesons are not well known",
    ", we adopt the standard quark counting rule and assume the @xmath28-quark is decoupled from ( @xmath23 , @xmath0 , @xmath24)-mesons . to take into account the interactions between @xmath28-quarks , we introduce @xmath29 and @xmath30 mesons following ref .",
    "@xcite for the baryon and ref .",
    "@xcite for the kaon .",
    "we also assume the kaon as a point particle .",
    "this treatment allows us to use @xmath8 as an input to fix the coupling constant between the @xmath23-meson and the kaon , @xmath31 . in our model the real part of the kaon optical potential at @xmath32",
    "can be written as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the values of the meson fields at @xmath13 .",
    "using the value of @xmath36 given by the quark counting rule , we can fix @xmath31 for each given value of @xmath8 .",
    "once the parameters of the model are fixed , the composition profile of neutron star matter can be obtained from the @xmath37-equilibrium and charge neutrality .",
    "we find that the composition of neutron star matter changes dramatically depending on the value of @xmath8 .    to investigate the model dependence of the results we also employ quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) model @xcite for calculating the composition of matter .",
    "the parameters of the qhd model are calibrated to produce exactly the same saturation properties as in the mqmc model .",
    "our calculations show that the onset densities of the kaon condensation and the compositions of matter at high densities are substantially model dependent . in sect .",
    "ii , we introduce model lagrangians and fix the model parameters . the results are discussed in sect .",
    "conclusions and discussions follow in sect .",
    "in this section we first briefly sketch the mqmc and qhd models by presenting the model lagrangians .",
    "the models are calibrated so as to be consistent with each other at the saturation density by fixing the coupling constants of both models to produce exactly the same saturation properties ; the saturation density , the binding energy , the symmetry energy , the nucleon effective mass , and the compression modulus .",
    "we then show how the physical quantities that will determine the composition of the neutron star matter can be obtained self - consistently .",
    "the model lagrangian comprises the terms for the octet baryons , exchange mesons , leptons and kaons ; @xmath38 .",
    "octet baryon , exchange meson and lepton terms in the mean field approximation can be written as @xmath39 \\psi_b \\label{eq : lagb } \\\\   { \\mathcal l}_m & = & -\\frac 12 m_\\sigma^2 \\sigma^2 - \\frac 12 m_{\\sigma^*}^2 { \\sigma^*}^2 + \\frac 12 m_\\omega^2 \\omega_0 ^ 2 + \\frac 12 m_\\phi^2 \\phi_0 ^ 2 + \\frac 12 m_\\rho^2 \\rho_{03}^2 , \\label{eq : lagm } \\\\   { \\mathcal l}_l & = & \\sum_l \\bar \\psi_l ( i \\gamma \\cdot \\partial - m_l)\\psi_l , \\label{eq : lagl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 denotes the sum over all the octet baryons ( @xmath40 ) , and @xmath41 stands for the sum over the free electrons and muons ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) .",

    "however , this fact may not necessarily rule out the possibility of @xmath84 becoming as large as 160 mev because there are other possible mechanisms which are not included .",
    "now let us consider the second aspect mentioned above . in the calculations made so far , we have assumed quark - counting rule in determining the hyperon - meson coupling constants .",
    "experiments on @xmath85-hypernuclei indicate that quark counting is a good approximation of the realistic interaction of @xmath85 hyperons in nuclei , which gives the value of @xmath85 optical potential at saturation density in the range @xmath86 mev . on the other hand",
    ", there is large ambiguity in the @xmath87 hyperon interaction strength . ref .",
    "@xcite shows that @xmath87 hyperon feels repulsion rather than attraction in nuclear medium .",
    "there are also experimental indications that the @xmath87 hyperon interaction is repulsive @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath87 interaction is indeed repulsive , the population profile of neutron star matter can change significantly from what is shown earlier in this work since we have used the quark counting rule . the number of @xmath88 is closely related to the onset of @xmath7 condensation since they compete with each other for the charge neutrality condition . to see the effect of possible repulsive nature of @xmath87 interaction on the kaon condensation , we have repeated the calculations with repulsive @xmath87 interaction .",
    "we first fit the coupling constants @xmath89 in mqmc and @xmath90 in qhd so that the @xmath87 optical potential value at the saturation density equals to @xmath91 mev , and fix the remaining meson-@xmath87 coupling constants with the quark counting rule .",
    "the resulting population profiles with the kaon optical potential @xmath92 mev are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ppl_repul_sigma ] . compared to the quark - counting results in fig .",
    "[ fig : population ] , the onset of kaon condensation occurs at slightly lower densities .",
    "this minor change happens regardless of @xmath8 value .",
    "however , the main features of kaon condensation , i.e. , its onset density , fast increase of population and its dominance at high densities are not much affected by the change of @xmath87 interaction in nuclear medium .",
    "using the modified quark - meson coupling model , we have obtained the composition profiles of neutron star matter , focusing on the effects of the strange particles of hyperons and kaons .",
    "motivated by recent theoretical predictions of deeply bound kaonic states @xcite and the subsequent claims of the observations of interesting peaks found in kek@xcite , finuda@xcite , and bnl@xcite experiments , large kaon optical potential @xmath8 was considered . by varying the value of @xmath8 , we have investigated how the onset density of the kaon condensation and the composition of the stellar matter change . employing the qhd model parameters which satisfy exactly the same saturation conditions as the mqmc model",
    ", we have investigated the model dependence of the results .",
    "we observed two common features from the two model calculations .",
    "first , a larger @xmath93 produces a smaller onset density of the kaon condensation .",
    "this behavior is easily understood from the relation between @xmath8 and @xmath31 together with the role of @xmath31 to the energy of the kaon @xmath94 .",
    "secondly , the number of kaons rapidly increases , and the number of negatively charged hyperons is strongly suppressed .",
    "this is due to the fact that the @xmath0-meson gives rise to attraction to @xmath7 whereas it couples to baryons repulsively .",
    "model dependence was also observed .",
    "the kaon condensation takes place at lower densities in the mqmc model .",
    "the number of kaons is always larger with the mqmc model for given @xmath8 values .",
    "larger @xmath23-meson fields in the mqmc model can explain these behaviors .",
    "the differences in the results from the two models become more prominent at larger densities .",
    "growing discrepancies at higher densities have its origin partly in the effective mass of baryons in each model , which greatly affects the self - consistency condition of the @xmath23-meson .",
    "the factor @xmath95 in the self - consistency condition of the @xmath23-meson is highly non - linear in the mqmc model , which can be interpreted as an infinite number of @xmath23-meson self - interaction terms .",
    "these higher order terms may require more proper and consistent treatment at high densities .",
    "an important issue in the dense matter physics is the restoration of the chiral symmetry . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , not only the mass but also the pion decay constant and meson - nucleon coupling constants decrease at a similar ratio at around the nuclear saturation density . in ref .",
    "@xcite the idea of scaling behaviour is applied to the neutron star matter using mqmc and qhd models with only nucleon degrees of freedom , and it is shown that the equation of state becomes stiffer when scaling effects are considered .",
    "this implies that if we include a scaling behaviour in our present models , it may ignite the onset of exotic states earlier than the present results which do not include a scaling .    in the kaon sector",
    ", the coupling constants of a kaon and exchange mesons are currently an important issue .",
    "we took various values of the optical potential of @xmath7 as an input to fix @xmath31 .",
    "other kaon - meson coupling constants are fixed from naive quark counting .",
    "it is known , however , that @xmath96 potential is repulsive with the magnitude @xmath97 mev at the saturation density @xcite .",
    "if @xmath98 as well as @xmath8 is used as an input , @xmath31 and @xmath36 can be determined uniquely .",
    "for instance , if we take @xmath99 mev and @xmath100 mev , then we get @xmath101 and @xmath102 . @xmath31 becomes smaller than the value listed in table iv , while @xmath36 becomes nearly twice of @xmath36 fixed from the quark counting .",
    "both @xmath23 and @xmath0 mesons contribute to the @xmath7 energy attractively , but since the @xmath0 meson becomes a dominant component at higher densities , taking into account of @xmath98 can produce appreciably different results .",
    "it may be interesting to see the effects of @xmath98 on the kaon condensation .    in our calculations",
    ", we have assumed the kaon as a point particle in both quark and hadron models .",
    "comparison of the two models , however , shows that whether we treat a hadron as a bag ( mqmc ) or a point particle ( qhd ) can produce a significant difference .",
    "therefore , it is worthwhile to treat the kaon as a bag and compare the corresponding result with that of a point - like kaon . in ref .",
    "@xcite a kaon is treated as a bag in the framework of the qmc model , but no work has been done yet with the mqmc model .",
    "we assume @xmath103 as a linear function of @xmath23-field , but some authors employ a non - linear form @xcite : @xmath104 if we expand this expression in powers of @xmath105 , we obtain @xmath106.\\ ] ] the leading order term of the @xmath23-field has a factor 1/2 , which is not present in eq .",
    "( 12 ) . due to the factor 1/2",
    ", the rate of decrease in @xmath103 with density would be reduced by a factor 2 , and this would shift the kaon condensation onset density to higher densities .",
    "this dependence on the kaon lagrangian may be worthwhile to be studied .",

    "<S> we use the modified quark - meson coupling ( mqmc ) model to study the composition profile of neutron star matter and compare the results with those calculated by quantum hadrodynamics ( qhd ) . both mqmc and qhd model parameters </S>",
    "<S> are adjusted to produce exactly the same saturation properties so that we can investigate the model dependences of the matter composition at high densities . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the possibility of deep kaon optical potential and find that the composition of matter is very sensitive to the interaction strength of kaons with matter . </S>",
    "<S> the onset densities of the kaon condensation are studied in detail by varying the kaon optical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mqmc model produces the kaon condensation at lower densities than qhd . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of kaon condensation changes drastically the population of octet baryons and leptons . </S>",
    "<S> once the kaon condensation takes place , the population of kaons builds up very quickly , and kaons become the dominant component of the matter . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath0-meson plays an important role in increasing the kaon population and suppressing the hyperon population . </S>"
