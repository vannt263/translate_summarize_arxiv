    "according to current models of cold - dark - matter structure formation , the first generation of massive baryonic objects , i.e. , stars , galaxies and quasars , was formed in the early universe as the result of density fluctuations of the intergalactic medium ( igm ; * ? ? ?",

    "the radiation from these objects gradually ionized the surrounding igm , ending the so - called `` dark age . ''",

    "the recent _ wmap _ results @xcite provide evidence that the igm reionization may have started at @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite suggests that there may have been a second stage of hydrogen reionization that took place at @xmath20 , and @xcite suggest that helium may also have been reionized twice , partially by an early generation of population iii stars , and subsequently by quasar radiation at @xmath21 .",
    "our knowledge of the igm has been derived largely from the ly@xmath5   forest absorption of neutral hydrogen .",
    "the expansion of the universe following reionization leads to a rapid drop in the hydrogen ly@xmath5  effective optical depth of the igm , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the number density of forest lines also increases toward lower column density , with @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "lines at a column density of @xmath24  represent the mean density the igm .",
    "the underdense regions , represented by hydrogen column densities below @xmath25 , have been largely undetected . throughout this paper",
    ", the column density @xmath26 refers to hydrogen , unless noted otherwise .",
    "the igm can also be traced by  absorption , which is far more sensitive than . under the hard photoionizing conditions at @xmath27 , he@xmath28 outnumbers h@xmath29 by a factor @xmath9 of the order of 100 @xcite .",
    "the  optical depth is therefore @xmath30 or approximately 25 times greater than that of  for turbulent line broadening and @xmath31 for thermal broadening .",
    "for a tenuous structure that produces an  optical depth less than 0.01 , even the best optical spectra may not provide a significant detection .",
    "but the corresponding  optical depth , at 0.25 , can be detected at a moderate signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio .",
    "absorption is therefore an effective tracer of the low - density structures that fill @xmath32 of the volume of the universe at @xmath27 .",
    "significant  absorption exists even in the spectral voids where there are no detected ly@xmath5  forest lines .",
    "as @xcite show , each of several different cdm models can explain the distribution of the  forest lines , but the various models predict different results for  absorption .",
    "the search for the  gunn - peterson effect has yielded significant results in recent years .",

    "spectra exhibit a significantly lower  opacity , enabling detailed studies of the ionization structure of the igm .",
    "hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) observations of the luminous quasar hs1700 + 64 ( @xmath35 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) revealed an average  optical depth of @xmath36 , which suggests that the dominant ionization source at @xmath37 is from quasars instead of stars , but the low resolution of hut does not allow a study of the individual absorption components .",
    "the bright quasar he23474342 ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is an extremely rare object that exhibits a clear line of sight at restframe wavelengths around 300   .",
    "its uv flux , at a level of @xmath40 , is the highest among the five quasars with known  ly@xmath5features @xcite , enabling a high - resolution study of  absorption with _ fuse_. below a redshift of 2.7 , @xcite resolved the  ly@xmath5  absorption as a discrete forest of absorption lines . the column - density ratio @xmath9=n()/n ( ) ranges from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , suggesting a mix of ionizing sources of radiation consisting of quasars and star - forming galaxies .",
    "however , approximately 50% of these lines do not have detectable   counterparts in the _ keck _ spectrum of this quasar . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the  absorption has a patchy structure , including regions with low opacity ( `` voids '' ) and regions with high opacity and no detectable flux ( blacked - out `` troughs '' ) . using high s / n _ hst_/stis observations of this region",
    ", @xcite found that the @xmath9 value is generally high , but shows large variations , from @xmath43 in the opacity gaps to a lower limit of 2300 at @xmath44 in a region that shows an extremely low  opacity over a 6.5   spectral range . in order to explain the shape of the opacity gaps ( absence of large individual absorption lines ) at this and other wavelengths",
    ", they suggested that six bright soft ionization sources lie near the line of sight , for which the ratio between the numbers of - to -ionizing photons reaching the igm is large .",
    "this change in character of the  absorption is similar to the large increases in lyman series  opacity at @xmath45 seen in several quasars discovered by the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "as these authors have suggested that reionization of the  in the igm occurred just prior to this epoch , it is likely that reionization of @xmath12 occurred slightly above a redshift of 3 .",
    "theoretical models @xcite also indicate that the reionization of intergalactic helium took place later than hydrogen as the number of -ionizing photons is significantly smaller than that for hydrogen .",
    "these initial regions of  ionization , however , would have recombined , and only reached full ionization at lower redshift during the quasar era .",
    "indirect evidence based on an increase in  line widths @xcite and a decrease in  opacity @xcite support the assumption that the final stage of  reionization may have taken place at @xmath46 .    in this paper , we present results based on a reprocessed _ fuse _  spectrum of he23474342 and a new _ vlt_/uves echelle spectrum .",
    "our previous paper @xcite used only the _ fuse _  data from the lif channels , and a modest s / n _ keck _ echelle spectrum between 3800 and 6000  .",
    "the improved _ fuse _  pipeline allows us to extract spectra from the sic channels , which extend the wavelength coverage to the 9121000   region .",
    "the expanded wavelength coverage enables us to study the evolution of intergalactic helium with redshift down to @xmath47 , and also to observe the ly@xmath6 portion of the  forest .",
    "spectrum spans the full redshift range covered by the _ fuse _   data , and its higher s / n makes it possible to identify weak  lines with  counterparts that are not detectable in the _ keck _ spectrum .",
    "we follow the traditional approach in this paper of fitting individual spectral features in the _ fuse _  and _ vlt _  spectra . in a separate paper , @xcite",
    "describe an independent analysis of the _ fuse _  spectrum at redshift 2.3 - 2.9 and another set of _ vlt_/uves data using a non - parametric approach to study the opacity variations in the igm .",
    "they also identify fluctuations in the ionizing radiation field on a fine - grained scale , @xmath48 .",

    "3 we explain how we identify and fit individual spectral features in the _ fuse _  and _ vlt _  spectra . in ",
    "4 we discuss the scientific results of our analysis , concentrating on the column - density distribution of ly@xmath5  absorbers (  4.1 ) , the velocity field in the igm (  4.2 ) , the evolution of the ionization state of the igm (  4.3 ) , the evolution of the  opacity (  4.4 ) , and the approach to the  reionization epoch (  4.5 ) .",

    "the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) is a nasa - cnes - csa mission dedicated to high - resolution spectroscopy between 905 and 1187  .",
    "it consists of two uv detectors , four rowland - circle gratings and four mirrors .",
    "the lif - coated optics yield a wavelength coverage of @xmath49  , and the sic - coated optics cover @xmath50  . for a full description of _ fuse _ , its mission , and its in - flight performance , see @xcite and @xcite .    the _ fuse _  observations of he23474342",
    "were carried out in three periods in 2000 : june 27 , august 18 - 25 , and october 15 - 20 .",
    "a total of 243 raw images were obtained , representing an exposure time of 619 kseconds , of which 431 kseconds were at night . while the _ fuse _  detector background is intrinsically low , the source count level from he23474342 is still weaker than the background because of the high spectral resolution .",
    "the key step in our data analysis is the background subtraction .",
    "the _ fuse _  background consists of two components : the detector dark count and the scattered light .",
    "the dark count is roughly constant across the detector but varies in intensity with time .",
    "the scattered light during day time is an order of magnitude stronger than at night , and it produces considerable and different spatial structures across the detectors .",
    "the inclusion of the day portion would completely obscure the weak source structure .",
    "we therefore use only the night portion of the data .    based on the data of this quasar from the lif channels of",
    "_ fuse _  and a _ keck _ optical spectrum , @xcite have reported a rich absorption structure that reflects a broad range of ionization level .",
    "the average value of @xmath51 is consistent with photoionization of the absorbing gas by a hard ionizing spectrum resulting from the integrated light of quasars .",
    "the presence of  absorbers with no  counterparts indicates that structure is present even in low - density regions .",
    "a new version of the _ fuse _  calibration software ( calfuse v2.2 ) enables us to reprocess the data and improve its quality .",
    "we first process each of the 243 raw exposures , rejecting undesirable events such as detector count bursts .",
    "the processed spectra are then merged to form a final image with the highest s / n possible . from this image",
    ", we are able to model and subtract the background more accurately than before .",
    "we perform the background subtraction using two parallel approaches , including the standard pipeline procedure and manual extraction . to extract the spectrum manually , we define respective background windows on both sides of the source extraction windows on the detector .",
    "the background variations are assumed to be linear across the spatial dimension ( y ) , and its slope is estimated from the two background windows . the background level at the extraction window is then interpolated at every wavelength unit along the dispersion direction ( x ) .",
    "this method can not be fully implemented for extraction windows near the detector edge . in such cases , we define two background windows on one side of the extraction window , calculate the slope of variations and extrapolate the background level at the source position .",
    "a pair of background windows is necessary because the background varis across the detector , even at a low level .    the manual extraction yields better results , as judged by the level of residual flux in the opaque portions of the  absorption spectrum . the standard pipeline extraction , on the other hand , produces a better photometric agreement at long wavelengths in the region of overlap with the hst / stis data .",
    "the final data we present here are based on the manual extraction using photometric corrections as described below .    for a given window position",
    ", we extract the data using different sets of detector pulse - height parameters @xcite : 4 - 16 , 5 - 16 , 7 - 15 , and 8 - 12 . in principle , dark current and photon events exhibit different pulse characteristics . by choosing a narrow band of the pulse height",
    ", one would be able to reduce the contribution of dark - current events .",
    "however , a fraction of the source counts would also be lost , leading to photometric inaccuracy .",
    "the standard parameters for the pulse height , between 4 and 16 counts , yield a flux level that is close to photometric .",
    "a pulse height range of 516 , however , maximizes the s / n , so we choose this range and normalize the extracted spectrum to the same flux level as obtained using the photometric pulse height range of 416 .",
    "the full set of _ fuse _  data consists of eight segments labeled lif 1a , 1b , 2a , 2b and sic 1a , 1b , 2a , 2b .",
    "sky emission lines are removed from the spectra @xcite .",
    "significant airglow lines include @xmath52584 ( second order at 1168  ) , @xmath521134 , @xmath52989 and the lyman - series lines .",
    "the spectra are then binned to 0.025  , and combined with their s / n as the weighting factor at every pixel .",
    "this level of binning gives critical sampling of two bins per @xmath53 resolution element provided by _",
    "fuse _ , and corresponds identically in velocity ( @xmath54 ) to the 0.1   bins we use in sampling the  spectrum described later in  2.2 .",
    "a typical s / n level per resolution element is 10 at the long wavelength part ( @xmath55  ) , and 3 at the short wavelengths .",
    "the spectral normalization involves two steps : first , we correct the zero level . while the spectra extracted with calfuse v2.2 improve upon earlier pipeline results , and our manual extraction technique is even better , there are still regions where the zero level is not perfect .",
    "this is particularly obvious in the sic spectra from detector 1 , where the sic 1a and 1b extraction windows lie near the edge of the detector .",
    "we correct the zero level using the  ly@xmath5  forest spectrum where there are many features with fully saturated absorption at the line center .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that their  counterparts will also be completely absorbed at the line center , as the  optical depth is considerably higher than that of the  feature .",
    "we assume that these data points should have zero flux , and fit a smoothly varying polynomial to these low points to determine the zero - level correction .",
    "this correction is up to 10% of the maximum flux in the lif data segments , and up to 40% in the sic channels .",
    "secondly , we normalize the _ fuse _  spectrum , assuming the intrinsic , unabsorbed spectrum is a reddened power law .",
    "since more than a thousand  absorption lines nearly blanket the entire _ fuse _  spectrum , it is difficult to determine the continuum level from the _ fuse _  spectrum itself . as described by @xcite , a pair of _",
    "spectra are used to derive the intrinsic continuum .",
    "these data were obtained contemporaneously with the respective _ fuse _  data and serve as a photometric standard for our extracted _ fuse _  spectrum .",
    "a comparison between the stis and _ fuse _  spectra indicates that the photometric quality of the _ fuse _  data is reasonably good , agreeing with the stis data to within about 5% between 1150 and 1187  .",
    "the best - fit power law is @xmath56(@xmath52/1000)@xmath57 , with e(b - v)=0.014 .",
    "an extrapolation of this continuum model serves as the baseline for the renormalization of our _ fuse _  spectrum .",
    "optical echelle spectra of he23474342 were obtained at the eso _",
    "vlt_/uves on 2001 november 23 - 24 .",

    "the spectral resolution is approximately 45,000 .",
    "we used the blue instrument arm , consisting of a @xmath58 ccd detector , an echelle grating of 41.59 line mm@xmath59 , and a cross disperser of 600 line mm@xmath59 and blaze wavelength of 4600  . with a central wavelength 4200   for the cross disperser",
    ", the spectrum covers the wavelength range between 3600 and 4800   in 31 orders , which corresponds to the entire  ly@xmath5  wavelength range studied with _ fuse _  from @xmath60 to 2.9 .",
    "there are significant overlaps in wavelength coverage between adjacent orders .",
    "the wavelength calibration spectra were taken with the thar lamp .",
    "using iraf tasks designed for echelle data , we processed the spectra . for each extraction segment",
    ", we used 10 - 15 pixels on both sides of the trace to derive the background .",
    "the final wavelength calibration is accurate to @xmath61  , and it has been corrected to vacuum wavelengths in a heliocentric reference frame .",
    "we normalized each individual echelle order with a polynomial , then rebinned them to 0.1  .",
    "we then merged all 31 segments of normalized spectra , weighted by the individual s / n ratios .",
    "the s / n ratio in the merged spectrum is about 110 per 0.1   bin at 4700  , and about 46 at 3850  .",
    "this is approximately 2.5 and 10 times that of the _ keck _ data , respectively .",
    "only the _ vlt _  data cover the wavelength range between 3600 and 3800  . to improve the continuum fitting , this count spectrum is further normalized with a high - order polynomial across the entire wavelength range .",

    "we analyze the spectral features in the _ fuse _  and _ vlt _  spectra using the iraf task _ specfit _ @xcite .",
    "absorption features are fit with gaussian profiles rather than voigt profiles .",
    "this is a good approximation for line components with column densities below @xmath62 .",
    "saturated lines may be better represented by voigt profiles , but it is not important for our purpose since our main goal is to study the weak absorption lines . because of the large number of components and variables , we carry out the fitting procedure in 48 wavelength segments of approximately 25   each .    below 3984   in the optical spectrum ,",
    "ly@xmath6  absorption starts to appear .",
    "line fitting in this region is carried out using both ly@xmath5  and ly@xmath6  for each identified feature .",
    "paired absorption lines are fit using the same velocity width and column density , and their central wavelengths are tied to the ratio of their intrinsic wavelengths .",
    "free parameters in the fit are line width , column density , and the centroid wavelength .",
    "the weakest features that we are able to identify in the _ vlt _   spectrum have a column density @xmath63 , mostly at wavelengths longward of 4400  . at the short - wavelength end",
    ", the minimum detectable column density is @xmath64 .",
    "the number of these weak lines and their fitted parameters are affected by the continuum level .",
    "the errors in their column densities may be as large as a factor of two .",
    "we identify metal lines as those with @xmath65 values less than 10 .",
    "a total of 852 ly@xmath5  absorption lines are present in the _ vlt _  spectrum over the full 3600 - 4750   wavelength range .",
    "the initial line fits to the _ fuse _  spectrum are based on our results from fitting the  ly@xmath5  forest . for every  absorption line , we define a   counterpart with the same velocity width ( see  4.2 ) and redshift , with only the column density allowed to vary . as described in @xcite ,",
    "additional  absorption lines are added in regions where the  optical depth is so high high that no known  component can provide with reasonable @xmath9 values .",
    "such added absorption lines are given a fixed doppler parameter @xmath66 .",
    "for the _ vlt _  spectrum , multiple gaussian profiles are often introduced to fit a single absorption feature .",
    "fitting to the corresponding _ fuse _",
    "data sometimes to converge to one of these profiles , but fails to identify the others . in such a case , we fix this set of profiles to the same @xmath9 value , as these absorbers are ionized by the same radiation field .",
    "approximately ten  absorption lines have no apparent  counterparts , and they are not apparently blended .",
    "we assign  column densities to these lines as 1-@xmath67 lower limits that are on the order of @xmath68 , and mark them in table 1 with null errors in the  column density .",
    "most of these absorption lines are only marginally detected in the _ vlt _  data ; therefore their reality may be questionable .",
    "it is worth noting that uncertainties in the _ fuse _  data reduction and fitting , particularly the imperfect background subtraction may contribute significant errors in these peculiar absorption lines .    at wavelengths",
    "shortward of 996  , the presence of  ly@xmath6  poses additional difficulty in line identification .",
    "we fit the _ fuse _  data in this region in two ways . for lines that are not badly blended ,",
    "we fit  ly@xmath5  and ly@xmath6   simultaneously , using the same approach we applied to the _ vlt _  spectrum .",
    "the ly@xmath5  and ly@xmath6  lines are forced to have the same column density , redshift , and doppler parameter , for those lines that are blended , the noisy ly@xmath6  region can adversely affect the fitting process .",

    "we then fit the  ly@xmath5  lines in the blended region using the corresponding  lines from the _ vlt _  spectrum to fix the redshifts and line widths . as above , if additional  opacity is needed at specific wavelengths , we add additional  ly@xmath5  components with a fixed doppler parameter",
    ". we do not fit the spectrum below 920  , as blended lyman - series airglow contamination becomes too strong to correct .    at wavelengths longward of 1000  ,",
    "our fits agree well with those in @xcite , but require fewer added  components .",
    "the higher quality of our _ vlt _  spectrum allows us to identify more weak hydrogen absorbers . between 1000 and 1130",
    " , we identify 362 absorption lines with both  and  ly@xmath5  absorption and only require 43 additional  ly@xmath5  lines with no  counterpart .",
    "the number of identified  ly@xmath5  forest lines is nearly twice that in the _ keck _ spectrum of this object @xcite over this spectral range , and they include most of the added  ly@xmath5  components in the work of @xcite .",
    "the properties of sample components are listed in table 1 : their absorption redshifts ,  column densities , doppler parameters ,  column densities , and @xmath9 values .",
    "null errors in the doppler parameter represent an added component that is not detected in the _ vlt _  data ( the corresponding  column density is the upper limit . ) in such a case , the @xmath9 value is an upper limit .",

    "below @xmath72 , line identification becomes difficult , and the results are not certain .",
    "@xcite suggest that this power law may be extended to lower column density , assuming a large correction factor .    as the _ fuse _",
    "data reveal a large number of absorption lines with low  column density , useful information about their distribution with column density may be obtained .",
    "we first examine the column - density distribution of the ly@xmath5  lines that are observed in both  and . in figure 2 , the distribution of the  forest lines in he23474342 is plotted .",
    "the results are consistent with a power law of @xmath73 between @xmath74 .",
    "another histogram displays the distribution of values derived from the   column density .",
    "each data point is divided by 62 , the median @xmath9 .",
    "the distribution of these calculated hydrogen absorption lines follows a pattern similar to the real ones , demonstrating the possibility of using   parameters to describe the  counterparts .",
    "the histograms do not match well at higher column density , as a result of this simplified approach which assumes a fixed value for @xmath9 .",
    "we extend the database for figure 2 with additional absorption lines which are detected only in . if the average value of @xmath75 , approximately 100 data points are added to the  database in figure 2 , to produce the results displayed in figure 3 . if we choose a value lower than 300 , many absorption - lines should have been detected in the optical spectrum , and values higher than 300 will leave a gap in the distribution shown in figure 3 .",
    "the added points represent our estimate of the low - column - density end of the  absorption line distribution .",
    "there is a significant downturn around @xmath76 , from @xmath77 to @xmath78 .",
    "on the basis of this pattern , we infer that the number of absorption lines with @xmath79   is negligible .",
    "a part of the observed trend in figures 2 and 3 at the low - column - density end may be attributable to the confusion limit of the _ fuse _  data : weak absorption features fall into other troughs and become undetected .",
    "we have carried out simulations by introducing additional absorption lines into the _ fuse _  spectrum , and performing the same line - fitting procedure described in  3 . at a  column density of @xmath80 , more than 90% of the absorption lines",
    "are identified . at @xmath81 ,",
    "approximately two thirds of the lines are identified .",
    "the others are heavily blended , and the fitting task only yields a single fitted component for them .",
    "this may explain why many fitted lines have doppler parameters greater than 40 .",
    "at the limiting column density of @xmath68 , only one out of five may be detected .",
    "assuming an average @xmath82 , these components have their  column density on the order of @xmath83 .",
    "a correction factor of 5 may therefore increase the number of weak absorbers at @xmath84 .",
    "the downturn of the distribution shown in figure 3 takes place at a   column density of @xmath85 , where the correction factor is insignificant .",
    "we therefore suggest that this change in the distribution is real , not just the result of confusion .",
    "an important but as yet unknown parameter in the igm is the velocity ratio @xmath86 between the @xmath12 ions and hydrogen atoms in an individual spectral feature .",
    "this is a vital clue to the actual physical processes that dominate the evolution of structure in the igm .",
    "previous models and observations often assumed a value , either 1.0 for purely turbulent motions , or 0.5 for purely thermal broadening , in order to constrain other parameters .",
    "even with the high spectral resolution of _ fuse _ , an attempt to derive the  doppler line widths is difficult because of line blending and the low s / n . in spectral voids , however , where absorption lines are sparse , we have identified a sample of individual  and  absorption lines that are not blended in either ly@xmath5  or ly@xmath6 .",
    "we fit the profiles of these individual absorption features ( figures 4 and 5 ) and let the velocity widths vary as free parameters .",
    "the optical depths of the ly@xmath5  and ly@xmath6  lines are also linked by simple atomic physics , providing an important additional constraint on the allowed range of the fitted line widths .",
    "table 2 summarizes the results of our fits .",
    "a linear fit to the line widths yields a ratio of the  to  line widths of @xmath14 . as shown figure 6 ,",
    "this velocity ratio is consistent with turbulence being dominant , with one or two cases of possible thermal line broadening .",
    "we therefore have assumed identical  and  line widths for all absorption lines in our analysis .",
    "the derived @xmath9 ratios are plotted in figure 7 , along with the lower limits from those  ly@xmath5  lines which do not have  counterparts ( now a minor fraction of the data set , @xmath87 ) and the upper limits from the  lines without significant  counterparts .",
    "our analysis reveals a significant population of igm structures with hydrogen column densities between @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "they account for approximately 40% of all the identified  absorption lines .",
    "we calculate the average value of @xmath9 in logarithmic units , including only lines that are detected in both the _ fuse _  and _ vlt _  spectra . for _",
    "n _ data points , we calculate the logarithmic average as @xmath90 , and its corresponding uncertainty as @xmath91 .",
    "the average value of @xmath92 strongly suggests that the main ionization source is the accumulated emission from quasars . @xcite and",
    "@xcite derive a mean spectral index below 1000    for quasars of @xmath93 , which is consistent with the ionization level measured here .",
    "the median value of @xmath9 is 62 , which is reasonably close to the average value .",
    "however , there is significant variation of the ionization parameter @xmath9 , from less than unity to over a thousand .",
    "some lines with low @xmath9 values in our list are associated with heavily saturated lyman - limit systems , in which the measurement errors are large .",
    "cases with @xmath94 may represent the regions in the igm that are ionized by local soft radiation sources , but not yet by the metagalactic uv background radiation field .",
    "approximately 90 such lines are added in fitting the _ fuse _   spectrum , particularly at @xmath95 .",
    "they are needed to explain the complete absorption troughs , and they confirm the suggestion of @xcite that a significant part of the  absorption may be produced by absorption lines without detected  counterparts .",
    "these lines represent the tenuous regions of the igm that have not been detected in hydrogen .",
    "the lack of such high @xmath9 values at lower redshifts suggests that the ionization of intergalactic helium is fairly complete at @xmath96 .",
    "figures 7 and 8 show that the column - density ratio @xmath9 decreases gradually toward lower redshift .",
    "the main reason appears to be the decline in the number of absorption lines with @xmath97 with decreasing redshift ( only one is seen below @xmath98 ) , as the  reionization by a metagalactic uv background field becomes complete . @xcite and @xcite model the evolution of the ionizing continuum under the assumption that quasar emission is the dominant source of ionizing photons and suggest that the /  ratio in the igm and the ly@xmath5  clouds increases from @xmath99 at @xmath100 to @xmath101 at @xmath102 , and then decreases again below 30 for @xmath103 .",
    "@xcite study the euv continuum shape of quasars and find that it remains fairly constant between redshifts of 0.3 and 2 .",
    "such a trend is also noted in the model results of @xcite for a fixed continuum - power - law index .",
    "our results strongly suggest that the main ionizing source at redshift @xmath104 is the accumulated radiation from quasars .",
    "as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , the large variations in @xmath9 may be due to local sources of ionizing radiation .",
    "for each observed value of @xmath9 , we infer the incident spectral index @xmath105 ( defined by @xmath106 ) using models of power - law radiation propagated through the igm ( * ? ? ? * model a2 in their figure 10 ) . in figure  9",
    "we compare this distribution of inferred spectral indices to those measured by @xcite . at low values of @xmath105",
    "the two distributions are similar , suggesting that the observed variations in @xmath9 are consistent with the natural variation of intrinsic quasar spectral indices . at high values of @xmath105",
    ", however , the excess of features with high @xmath9 indicates a contribution from an additional population of soft ionizing sources such as star - forming galaxies or obscured agn .",
    "one problem with this simple interpretation is that the observed space density of quasars at @xmath102 is too sparse to produce fluctuations on the observed scale of @xmath107 , and the expected high space density of star - forming galaxies should produce a more uniform radiation field . as discussed by @xcite , the combination of the natural variation in quasar spectral indices , the resulting difference in the proximity spheres for  and , and radiative transfer through a non - uniform igm may all conspire to produce the observed variations in @xmath9 .",
    "studies of  absorption along several lines of sight ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) have shown that from @xmath108 to @xmath109 the average opacity increases toward higher redshift . in our reprocessed _ fuse _  spectrum of he23474342 , for a given section of the spectrum , we calculate the average transmission and its associated uncertainty by summing over the _",
    "n _ data points @xmath110 and @xmath111 , where the transmission at each point @xmath112 in the normalized binned spectrum is given by @xmath113 . the  ly@xmath5  optical depth is then calculated as @xmath114 . at wavelengths shorter than 995.5  ,",
    "however , we must modify this procedure as  ly@xmath6  and other higher - order lyman series lines begin to blend in with the  ly@xmath5  forest .",
    "the high resolution of the _ vlt _  and _ fuse _  spectra enable us to separate the ly@xmath5  absorption lines at @xmath115 from high - order lyman lines at higher redshift . to isolate the contribution from the ly@xmath5  absorption lines alone , we construct a model for the short - wavelength section of the spectrum based on the  line list from the fitted _ vlt _  spectrum ( for the  ly@xmath5  lines ) and the fitted parameters of the longer - wavelength  ly@xmath5  lines ( for the higher - order lyman lines ) . at wavelengths shortward of 995.5   ( @xmath116 ) , we then calculate the  ly@xmath5  opacity from this modeled spectrum .",
    "figure 10 shows the average  ly@xmath5  optical depth as a function of redshift . for comparison , we show the empirical trend with redshift for  of @xmath117 @xcite . at redshifts below 2.7 ,",
    "the agreement is quite reasonable ; however , at higher redshift , the opacity grows much more rapidly .",
    "we discuss this in the next section .      at redshifts above @xmath118 ,",
    "the spectrum of he23474342 is largely opaque in  ly@xmath5 .",
    "the high s / n _ hst_/stis spectrum @xcite shows several deep absorption troughs at @xmath119 .",
    "following the nomenclature and wavelength intervals defined in their table 3 , troughs a , c , d , and i have average  ly@xmath5  optical depths of @xmath120 or more . our new short - wavelength _",
    "fuse _  data allow us to derive more accurate optical depths in these deepest troughs since we can now measure the opacity not only in ly@xmath5 , but also in the corresponding higher - order lyman lines .",
    "for example , trough a is seen in ly@xmath5  ( 1175.6 - 1178 ) , ly@xmath6   ( 991.8 - 993.8 ) , and ly@xmath7  ( 940.5 - 942.4 ) . because of these low s / n and uncertain continuum , the ly@xmath7  troughs ( visible in figure 1 ) are not quantitatively useful in improving the limits on the ly@xmath5  opacity . to measure the average optical depth due to ly@xmath6  alone in a given wavelength interval ,",
    "we first calculate the optical depth directly from the _ fuse _  spectrum .",
    "there are overlying  ly@xmath5  lines throughout this region of the spectrum , however , and we correct for these by using the predicted  ly@xmath5  opacity based on the  ly@xmath5  line list in each of these intervals obtained from the _ vlt _  spectrum . for each  ly@xmath5  line , we assume the median value of the -  column - density ratio @xmath121 , compute the corresponding  ly@xmath5  column density , and assume that it has the same redshift and velocity width as the  feature .",
    "we then integrate this synthetic  ly@xmath5  spectrum to obtain the contaminating contribution of  ly@xmath5  to the opacity in each of the regions that we measure for the ly@xmath6  transmission .",
    "table 3 summarizes our opacity measurements for each of the wavelength regions identified by @xcite . for each  ly@xmath5  wavelength region in column 2 , we give the redshift at the center of the region in column 3 , the  ly@xmath5  opacity measured from the _ fuse _  spectrum in column 4 , the  ly@xmath5  opacity from the stis spectrum in column 5 , the raw  ly@xmath6  opacity from the corresponding interval in the short - wavelength portion of the _ fuse _  spectrum in column 6 , the corrected opacity of the ly@xmath6  region for overlying   ly@xmath5  lines in column 7 , and the inferred  ly@xmath5  opacity based on the corrected ly@xmath6   opacity in column 8 .",
    "we derive the inferred ly@xmath5  opacity based on the higher - order lyman lines using the standard relationship between the optical depth and the oscillator strengths for lines in the lyman series : @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the oscillator strengths .    for the deepest troughs where",
    "only lower limits on the opacity could be set using the stis spectrum , we conclude that the average optical depth of ly@xmath5  is high , but finite , with a typical value of @xmath125 . as shown in figure 10 , the distribution of the  ly@xmath5  optical depth follows a slowly rising empirical curve similar to that observed for the overall  opacity , and suddenly increases at @xmath126 .",
    "such a sudden change in the  opacity may signal the late stages of the reionization of intergalactic @xmath12 at @xmath27 .",
    "an analogous phenomenon is also observed for intergalactic hydrogen at @xmath127 @xcite , where the  opacity abruptly rises from @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "the predicted increase at this epoch is more rapid than @xmath117 @xcite , and the merging of ionized bubbles should produce a huge discontinuity at some slightly higher redshift .",
    "numerical simulations of  reionization @xcite illustrate this same effect . a slow rise in opacity with redshift that roughly follows a power law in @xmath130 shows first a marked departure from the power law followed by a discontinuity of several orders of magnitude that corresponds to the epoch when all the strmgren spheres began to merge .",
    "our inferences from the he23474342 spectrum are consistent with indirect evidence from  line widths @xcite and  ly@xmath5  forest opacity @xcite suggesting that the  reionization discontinuity occurred at @xmath131 , and that we are seeing only the final stages in the process of  reionization .",
    "we have studied absorption by  and  in the igm over a redshift range @xmath132 using deep , new _",
    "vlt_/uves spectra and reprocessed _ fuse _  data for the quasar he23474342 .",
    "the _ vlt _",
    "data reach a limiting  column density of @xmath88 . more than 90% of the  absorption lines identified in the _ fuse _   spectrum have  counterparts , suggesting that we have traced most of the igm mass , and that only a small fraction of it exists in regions with  column density smaller than @xmath88 .",
    "the reprocessed _ fuse _  data extend our view of  absorption to wavelengths shortward of 1000  , allowing us to study its properties down to redshifts as low as @xmath96 , and giving us access to the ly@xmath6  portion of the forest . using these data",
    ", we reach the following conclusions :    1 .   the distribution function of the absorption features is a power law with respect to hydrogen column density .",
    "the identified and added  absorption lines in the _ fuse _  spectrum suggest a low - column - density cutoff around an  column density of @xmath133 , with a gradually diminishing contribution from lower column density features down to @xmath134 .",
    "2 .   by analyzing a sample of isolated  features with both ly@xmath5  and ly@xmath6   components , we are able to compare the  line widths to the widths of their  counterparts .",
    "we find that the ratio of  to  doppler parameters @xmath135 , indicating that the igm may be dominated by turbulent gas motions .",
    "we find that the ratio of  to  column densities @xmath9 shows a gradual evolution with redshift , decreasing from a median value of @xmath13670 at @xmath137 to @xmath13640 at @xmath138 .",
    "the number of  absorption features with no  counterparts , indicative of igm regions photoionized by very soft spectra , also decreases with decreasing redshift ( figure 7 and 8) .",
    "this trend suggests that by a redshift of 2 , the ionization of intergalactic @xmath12 is mainly due to agn .",
    "4 .   from @xmath60 to 2.7",
    ", we see a slow increase in  ly@xmath5  optical depth . at @xmath139 ,",
    "the average  optical depth is about 0.5 , increasing to @xmath140 at @xmath141 .",
    "a sudden increase in optical depth to @xmath142 is observed at @xmath143 .",
    "this trend in optical depth with redshift is analogous to that observed in  at higher redshift .",
    "we limit the  ly@xmath5  optical depths in the opaque regions of the uv spectrum at @xmath10 to values of @xmath125 by using the corresponding troughs in the ly@xmath6   portions of the spectrum to extend our dynamic range .",
    "this sudden , but finite , increase in optical depth suggests that we are seeing the end of the  reionization process that began at an earlier epoch as indicated indirectly by the increase in  line widths and  opacity observed at @xmath144 .    the successful execution of the _ fuse _  observations of this quasar is the result of many years of collaborative work of the _ fuse _  science team .",
