    "in the past few years , @xmath1-models in low dimensions have become an increasingly important area of research , often arising as approximate models in the contexts of both particle and solid state physics .",
    "they have been used in the construction of high-@xmath2 superconductivity and the quantum hall effect ; in two euclidean dimensions , they appear to be the low - dimensional analogues of four - dimensional yang - mills theories .",
    "moreover , they are examples of the harmonic maps studied by differential geometers and , as such , are interesting in themselves .",
    "but only very special @xmath1-models in ( 2 + 1)-d are integrable @xcite , and the physically relevant lorentz - invariant models are not amongst them ; in these cases , recourse to numerical evolution must be made .",
    "the simplest lorentz - invariant model in ( 2 + 1)-d is the @xmath0 model , which involves three real scalar fields , @xmath3(@xmath4)@xmath5\\{@xmath6(@xmath4 ) , @xmath7=1,2,3 } , with the constraint that @xmath3 lies on the unit sphere @xmath8 : @xmath9 subject to this constraint , the lagrangian density and the corresponding equations of motion are @xmath10 @xmath11\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}+\\partial^{2}_{x } \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}+\\partial^{2}_{y}\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}.    \\label{eqmp}\\ ] ] note that we are concerned with the model in ( 2 + 1)-d : @xmath12 , with the speed of light set equal to unity .",
    "an alternative and convenient formulation of the model is in terms of one independent complex field , @xmath13 , related to the fields @xmath6 via @xmath14 in this formulation , the lagrangian density and the corresponding equations of motion read ( asterisk denotes complex conjugation ) @xmath15 and @xmath16}{1+|w|^{2}}. \\label{eqmw}\\ ] ] the problem is completely specified by giving the boundary conditions . as usual",
    "we take @xmath17 where @xmath3@xmath18(@xmath19 ) is independent of the polar angle @xmath20 . in ( 2 + 1)-d",
    "this condition ensures a finite potential energy , whereas in two euclidean dimensions , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath3 is independent of time , it leads to the finiteness of the action , which is precisely the requirement for quantization in terms of path integrals . as shown by several people @xcite , any rational function @xmath21 or @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , is a static solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqmw ] ) .",
    "these are the instantons of the model , and can be regarded as _",
    "static _ solitons of the same model in ( 2 + 1)-d .",
    "the simplest one - soliton solution , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is a free parameter determining the size of the soliton ) has been numerically studied by leese _ et.al _",
    "when viewed as an evolving structure in ( 2 + 1)-d , the soliton has been found to be unstable .",
    "any small perturbation , either explicit or introduced by the discretization procedure , changes its size .",
    "this instability is associated with the conformal invariance of the @xmath0 lagrangian in two dimensions .",
    "the @xmath0 solitons , however , can be stabilized through a judicious introduction of a scale into the model , thereby breaking its conformal invariance .",
    "this has been done by leese _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite and , using a more general field , by ourselves @xcite .    in the present article we present the results of soliton - like scattering in ( 2 + 1)-d obtained by applying the methods of @xcite to a more general skyrmion field . in the next section we present our skyrme model and give a brief account of our previous paper @xcite , where the same model was considered for the case of zero - speed systems . after explaining the numerical procedure in section 3 , we pass on to discuss two - skyrmion scattering in section 4 .",
    "the closing section contains our conclusions .",
    "using the @xmath13-formulation , our skyrme model is defined by the lorentz - invariant lagragian density @xmath26\\nonumber \\\\ & -&4\\theta_{2}\\frac{|w-\\lambda|^{8}}{(1+|w|^{2})^{4 } } , \\label{lds}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is given by eq .",
    "( [ ldw ] ) and @xmath28,@xmath29 are real parameters with dimensions of length squared and inverse length squared , respectively ; they introduce a scale into the model , which is no longer conformal invariant . if the size of the solitons is appropriately chosen , it is energetically unfavourable for the solitons to change it .",
    "the @xmath28-term is the ( 2 + 1)-d analogue of the skyrme term , whereas the @xmath29-term is a potential - like one .",
    "unlike the former , the latter term is highly nonunique @xcite .",
    "the field equation corresponding to the above lagrangian can be cast into the form    @xmath30}{1+|w|^{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{4\\theta_{1}}{(1+|w|^{2})^{2}}[2w^{*}_{tx } w_{t}w_{x}+2w^{*}_{ty}w_{t}w_{y}-2w^{*}_{xy}w_{x}w_{y } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & w^{*}_{xx}(w_{y}^{2}-w_{t}^{2})+w^{*}_{yy}(w_{x}^{2 } -w_{t}^{2})-w^{*}_{tt}(w_{x}^{2}+w_{y}^{2})\\nonumber \\\\ & + & w_{xx}(|w_{t}|^{2}-|w_{y}|^{2})+w_{yy}(|w_{t}|^{2 } -|w_{x}|^{2})+w_{tt}(|w_{x}|^{2}+|w_{y}|^{2})\\nonumber \\\\ & + & w_{xy}(w_{x}^{*}w_{y}+w_{y}^{*}w_{x})-w_{tx}(w_{t}^{*}w_{x } + w_{x}^{*}w_{t})-w_{ty}(w_{t}^{*}w_{y } + w_{y}^{*}w_{t})\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{2w}{1+|w|^{2}}((w^{*}_{t}w_{y}-w^{*}_{y}w_{t})^{2 } + ( w^{*}_{x}w_{t}-w^{*}_{t}w_{x})^{2}-(w^{*}_{x}w_{y } -w^{*}_{y}w_{x})^{2})]\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{16 \\theta_{2}|w-\\lambda|^{2}}{(1+|w|^{2})^{3 } } , \\label{eqms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the notation @xmath31 , @xmath32 , _",
    "etc_. , has been used .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath33 is a static solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqms ] ) , provided the following relation holds : @xmath34{2 \\theta_{1}/\\theta_{2}}}{a - b}. \\label{fix}\\ ] ] this is the familiar one - instanton of the non - linear @xmath0 model , but now @xmath25 , which characterizes its size , is no longer a free parameter : it is fixed by eq .",
    "( [ fix ] ) .",
    "the instanton , with its size thus fixed , is usually referred to as a ` skyrmion ' .",
    "one can readily check that the maximum of its total energy density is given by @xmath35 for the parameter values given below in section 3 , eq .",
    "( [ emax ] ) yields @xmath36 , the ` canonical size ' .",
    "the numerically - obtained @xmath37 is very near this value ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the distance from @xmath37 to the centre of the lattice is given by @xmath38 .    to study scattering processes we take the field @xmath39 which describes two instantons .",
    "however , as there are interaction forces between the instantons , eq .",
    "( [ 2s ] ) is not a static solution of the equations of motion .    in our previous paper @xcite , where we studied only the case of skyrmions started off at rest , we numerically evolved eqs .",
    "( [ s ] ) and ( [ 2s ] ) and found two basic results :    * the field ( [ s ] ) remains almost perfectly static , its total energy density being practically unaltered as time elapses ( see figure  1 ) ; * the field ( [ 2s ] ) shows two skyrmions shaking off some kinetic energy , thus adjusting themselves to their canonical sizes .",
    "this is in accordance to expectation , as this field is not a solution of the equations of motion .",
    "then the skyrmions slowly move away from each other , unveiling the presence of a repulsive force between them .",
    "these observations confirm the results obtained in @xcite , where the skyrmion of the model was just @xmath40 .",
    "this configuration posseses a total energy density whose maximum is positioned at the centre of the grid ( @xmath41 ) , the analogue of eq .",
    "( [ emax ] ) being @xmath42 , @xmath43{2 \\theta_{1}/\\theta_{2}}$ ] . with regards to the scattering ,",
    "reference @xcite considered fields of the form @xmath44 which , as their cousins ( [ 2s ] ) , resemble two interacting instantons in an approximate manner .",
    "our simulations employed the fourth - order runge - kutta method , and approximated the spatial derivatives by finite differences ; the laplacian was evaluated using the nine - point formula .",
    "worthy of note is the fact that the finite - difference expressions for the derivatives of the fields @xmath40 and @xmath45 , used in @xcite , are exact .",
    "this is no longer true for our more general model which , in this sense , is more ` perturbed ' .",
    "fortunately , this factor turned out to have no significant effect on the qualitative properties of the discretized version of our model .",
    "all computations were performed on the workstations at durham , on a fixed 201@xmath46201 lattice with spatial and time steps @xmath47=@xmath48=0.02 and @xmath49=0.005 .",
    "every few iterations we rescaled the fields @xmath50 .",
    "we also included along the boundary a narrow strip to absorb the various radiation waves , thus reducing their effects on the skyrmions via the reflections from the boundary .",
    "as time elapses , this absorption of radiation manifests itself through a small decrease of the total energy , which gradually stabilizes as the radiation waves are gradually absorbed .",
    "we choose the parameters to have the values : @xmath28=0.015006250 , @xmath29=0.1250 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 which , according to eq .",
    "( [ fix ] ) , set @xmath25=1 .",
    "our simulations look at the initial configuration    @xmath53    and evolve it for different initial velocities .",
    "first , let us consider head - on collisions . there is always an initial burst of radiation as the skyrmions regain their canonical size . at small speeds ,",
    "the skyrmions approach each other , but the repulsive force between them results in their motion being reversed . in figure  2",
    "we present some pictures of the total energy density for skyrmions with initial speed equal to 0.2 ; the corresponding contour plots are shown in figure  3 .",
    "a qualitatively similar behaviour is observed for speeds up to approximately 0.3 , for which the skyrmions acquire enough kinetic energy to overcome their mutual repulsion ; during their collision they form a rather complicated state and then re - emerge at 90@xmath54 to the original direction of motion .",
    "the emerging skyrmions are initially shrinking but , after they have travelled some distance , they expand once more .",
    "this final state is achieved after some oscillations of the energy density .",
    "figure  4 and figure  5 show several total energy density pictures and contour plots for this 90@xmath54-scattering , whereas figure  6 exhibits how the amplitude of the total energy density for the above cases varies in time .    in the case of non - zero impact parameter",
    "the results are very much as expected . with an impact parameter small enough to prevent the skyrmions from getting too quickly to the boundary",
    ", they scatter almost backwards along their original trajectories or at 90@xmath54 , depending on the initial speed .",
    "also , the larger the impact parameter , the smaller the scattering angle .",
    "a typical case is shown in figure  7 .    on comparing these results with those obtained for the configuration @xmath44 we find",
    "there is no qualitative difference , and hence the results obtained in @xcite are borne out by the general case studied in the present work .",
    "we have performed a numerical study of the scattering properties of the general two - instanton ( -skyrmion ) field configuration of our version of the skyrme model in ( 2 + 1)-d , confirming the results previously found in other version of the model where , unlike the case studied in this paper , the finite - difference expressions for the derivatives of the fields enjoyed the numerically convenient feature of being exact .",
    "this factor , however , did not affect the qualitative scattering properties of the model under study .",
    "although our field configurations resemble two instantons in an approximate manner -the model is not integrable- , they exhibit a clear soliton - like behaviour .",
    "all radiation effects are small and the skyrmions total energy density profiles are preserved during the scattering process",
    ". they may get distorted , but always recover when the distance between the skyrmions becomes large enough .",
    "their interaction is of a repulsive nature , at least at large distances , the interaction being more difficult to asses when the skyrmions are close together . for head - on collisions",
    "there is a velocity below which the skyrmions bounce back , and above which they scatter at ninety degrees .",
    "there is a resemblance both with the properties of kinks in the @xmath55 model , which has a critical velocity , and with monopole scattering at 90@xmath54 .",
