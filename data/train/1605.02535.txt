    "<S> we consider elliptic transmission problems with complex coefficients across an interface . under proper transmission conditions , that extend known conditions for well - posedness , and sub - ellipticity we derive microlocal and local carleman estimates near the interface . </S>",
    "<S> carleman estimates are weighted _ a priori _ estimates of the solutions of the elliptic transmission problem . </S>",
    "<S> the weight is of exponential form , @xmath0 where @xmath1 can be taken as large as desired . </S>",
    "<S> such estimates have numerous applications in unique continuation , inverse problems , and control theory . </S>",
    "<S> the proof relies on microlocal factorizations of the symbols of the conjugated operators in connection with the sign of the imaginary part of their roots . </S>",
    "<S> we further consider weight functions where @xmath2 , with @xmath3 acting as a second large paremeter , and we derive estimates where the dependency upon the two parameters , @xmath1 and @xmath3 , is made explicit . applications to unique continuation properties are given . </S>",
    "<S> + rsum : nous considrons des problmes de transmission elliptiques  coefficients complexes . en tendant des conditions qui rendent ce problme bien pos , et sous condition de sous - ellipticit nous obtenons des ingalits de carleman microlocales et locales  linterface qui sont des ingalits a priori  poids pour les solutions du problme . les fonctions poids sont exponentielles , @xmath0 , o le paramtre @xmath1 peut tre choisi arbitrairement grand . </S>",
    "<S> de telles estimations ont de nombreuses applications comme pour les questions de prolongement unique , les problmes inverses et le contrle . </S>",
