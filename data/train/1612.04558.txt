    "even if nonlinear distortions are often present , many systems can be approximated by a linear model . when the nonlinear distortions are too large , a nonlinear model is required .",
    "one option is to use a block - oriented model  @xcite , which consists of interconnections of linear dynamic and nonlinear static systems .",
    "one of the simplest block - oriented models is the wiener model ( see fig .",

    "this is the cascade of a linear dynamic and a nonlinear static system .",
    "wiener models have been used before to model e.g.  biological systems  @xcite , a ph process  @xcite , and a distillation column  @xcite .",
    "some methods have been proposed to identify wiener models , see e.g.  @xcite for a nonparametric approach where the nonlinearity is assumed to be invertible , @xcite for the maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) , @xcite for an approach built on the concept of model complexity control , and @xcite for a frequency domain identification method where memory nonlinearities are considered .",
    "more complex parallel wiener systems are identified in  @xcite using a subspace based method , and in  @xcite using a parametric approach that needs experiments at several input excitation levels .",

    "this paper considers a wiener - schetzen model ( a type of parallel wiener model , see fig .",

    "the recent book  @xcite also provides some industrial relevant examples of wiener , hammerstein , and wiener - hammerstein models , that can be handled by the wiener - schetzen model structure due to its parallel nature .",
    "in fact , a wiener - schetzen model can describe a large class of nonlinear systems arbitrarily well in mean - square sense ( see @xcite for the theory and other practical examples ) . if the system has fading memory , then for bounded slew - limited inputs , a uniform convergence is obtained  @xcite . in a wiener - schetzen model ,",
    "the dynamics are described in terms of orthonormal basis functions ( obfs ) .",
