    "the information - theoretic study of a communication network design is usually guided by the assumption that users data buffers are always full .",
    "this assumption , on one hand , greatly simplifies the problem and enables a rigorous mathematical methodology to study networks . on the other hand",
    ", it ignores the bursty nature of real sources and lacks delay considerations , leading to the so - called unconsummated union between information theory and communication networks @xcite .",
    "there has been a substantial body of literature that made progress in bridging the gap between information theory and communication networks , for example see @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , a large portion of the problem remains unresolved .",
    "in particular , delay , as argued in @xcite , is not only a performance metric , but more importantly a fundamental quantity that may also affect the communication rate - accuracy trade - off .",
    "the most natural way to model transmission delay is to simply view it as a function of rate , specifically the total number of bits divided by rate .",
    "suppose one is interested in studying the minimum sum delay in a two - user gaussian symmetric multi - access channel with each user transmitting a fairly large amount of data , say @xmath0 bits .",
    "following the above approach , one would formulate an optimization problem @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , is the capacity region of the multi - access channel .",
    "accordingly the solution is to let each user transmit at half of the sum rate defining @xmath4 , yielding a total sum delay of @xmath5 .",
    "however there exists an alternative scheme that outperforms the above strategy .",
    "first the two users could transmit at the corner point of @xmath4 until one user has finished transmitting of its bits .",
    "then the remaining user boosts its rate to the point - to - point capacity to complete transmission of its remaining bits .",
    "this results in a total sum delay of @xmath6 , which is less than @xmath5 .",
    "this example illustrates that the limitation of modeling delay as a function of the multi - access capacity region stems from the very assumption underlying the formulation of this region , i.e. users data buffers are always full and hence there is always multi - user interference .    in this paper , we study a specific communication scenario  transmitting large files over two - user channels .",
    "our goal is to study transmission delay in an information - theoretic setting through investigating the _ completion time",
    "_ problem .",
    "mathematically we model the large file transmission as follows : for each user , there are @xmath7 , @xmath8 , bits to be transmitted where @xmath9 is a scaling factor to ensure information - theoretic arguments with large block lengths can be invoked .",
    "let @xmath10 be the actual number of channel uses for user @xmath11 to complete the transmission .",
    "then the _ normalized completion time _ ( or _ completion time _ for short ) is defined as @xmath12 in the limit of large @xmath10 and @xmath9 .",
    "assuming no transmitter / receiver cooperation or feedback , we focus on three representative classes of two - user channels : multi - access channel ( mac ) , broadcast channel ( bc ) and interference channel ( ic ) . we formulate completion time using the concept of _ constrained rates _ , where users codewords are constrained to span different block - lengths .",
    "this allows us to relax the full - buffer assumption and hence leads to a way of incorporating delay in an information - theoretic setting .",
    "the achievability of completion time is defined in terms of the achievability of the corresponding constrained rate . in order to obtain the completion time region @xmath13 ,",
    "i.e. the set of all achievable completion times , we show that it is necessary to obtain the corresponding constrained capacity region .",
    "we first consider a discrete memoryless multi - access channel ( dm - mac ) and explicitly characterize its constrained capacity region . in the achievable scheme ,",
    "one operates the channel in two independent phases : a multi - access phase when both users are transmitting subject to the standard dm - mac rate constraint and a point - to - point phase when one user has finished and the other transmits at the maximum point - to - point rate . for a gaussian multi - access channel ( gmac ) assuming expected per symbol power constraints , we establish a closed - form expression of @xmath13 . for a broadcast channel and an interference channel ,",
    "since even the standard capacity region remains unknown for a generic discrete memoryless case @xcite , we only focus on the gaussian channels .",
    "we derive a closed - form expression of the completion time region of a gaussian broadcast channel ( gbc ) and find inner and outer bounds of the completion time region for a gaussian interference channel ( gic ) . throughout these investigations ,",
    "we observe that although consisting of two convex subregions , the completion time region as a whole may not be convex . to demonstrate the usage of the completion time region , we seek one particular utility optimization ",
    "the weighted sum completion time minimization over @xmath13for a gmac and a gbc .",
    "we also extend the discussion for gaussian channels to the case where the expected per symbol power constraint is replaced by the expected block power constraint .    one key observation made in this paper",
    "is that operating the channel in two independent phases  multi - user phase and single - user phase  depending on transmission completion status suffices to achieve the completion time region .",
    "this decoupling greatly simplifies the codebook design as in each phase , the standard capacity achieving codebook can be used and there is no need to code across phases . while the completion time formulation can be readily extended to more complicated channels such as channels with relays , transmitter / receiver cooperations and feedbacks , we provide a simple example of a gaussian z interference channel with a relay to demonstrate that the multi - phase scheme may be no longer optimal .",
    "we leave the analysis of completion time in more complicated multi - user channels with cooperation and/or feedback to future studies .",
    "this work , in many aspects , is inspired by @xcite , where the authors solved the sum completion time minimization problem for a @xmath14-user symmetric gmac by drawing an analogy to multi - processor queues .",
    "compared to @xcite , we give a general formulation of the completion time and provide a complete characterization of the completion time region for a two - user dm - mac , gmac and gbc . in another related work @xcite , the authors considered an interference channel where power control is used to minimize some convex utility function over the completion time region obtained by treating interference as noise .",
    "compared to @xcite , we adopt an information - theoretic approach without restriction to any specific coding scheme such as treating interference as noise .",
    "this paper is organized as the follows . in section",
    "ii , the concept of constrained rates is introduced , based on which a formulation of completion time is then given .",
    "section iii treats a dm - mac and a gmac , where a detailed derivation of the completion time region is given . following the same approach ,",
    "the completion time regions of a gbc and a gic are obtained in section iv .",
    "section v discusses utility optimization using the completion time region and section vi provides an extension for gaussian channels with the expected block power constraint .",
    "conclusions and discussions are provided in section vii .",

    "@xmath20 means @xmath21 for all @xmath22 .",
    "we assume the total amount of information to be transmitted for user @xmath11 is @xmath7 bits with @xmath23 fixed , @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 is an asymptotically large scaling factor used to ensure information theoretic arguments .",
    "for example , this could correspond to each user having a large file to communicate . unlike the classical information theory , which is based on a full - buffer assumption , having some users finish early is not only desirable to reduce the completion time of those users , but also preferable for the remaining users since they can enjoy reduced multi - user interference for the remaining transmission . in order to capture this , and to formulate the completion time problem , we will define communication rates over different number of channel uses for different users , as opposed to the standard definition , where users codewords span the same number of channel uses .",
    "we refer this as _ constrained rate _ and provide a complete definition for mac in section ii.a .",
    "similar definitions for bc and ic are briefly discussed in section ii.b and ii.c , where the differences are highlighted .",

    "one example , minimizing the weighted sum completion time , has been solved for a gmac and a gbc . for gaussian channels with expected block power constraint",
    ", the completion time region can not be found by simply mapping the capacity region and a numerical approach for the computation of @xmath13 has been proposed .",
    "while this paper has dealt with the most common multi - user channels , i.e. mac , bc and ic , one notable piece from the network information theory remains missing , i.e. relays .",
    "below we give an example where the multi - phase operation , which leads to the characterization of the completion time region in all channels considered in this paper , ceases to be optimal with the presence of relays .",
    "consider the gaussian interference - relay channel shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multihop ] , where a half - duplex relay receives in - band and transmits out - of - band .",

    ", we will show that the two - phase operation  the multi - user transmission phase followed by a point - to - point transmission phase  is suboptimal .",
    "first of all , we argue that @xmath436 is an achievable completion time pair . to achieve @xmath437 , source 1",
    "transmits at rate @xmath438 until completion . to achieve @xmath439 , source 2 also needs to transmit at rate @xmath440 and this is possible if interference can be removed completely , which is accomplished as follows .",
    "the relay decodes interference message in the first @xmath441 channel uses , re - encodes interference message and forwards for the remaining @xmath442 channel uses .",
    "the total amount of mutual information accumulated at receiver 2 for interference decoding during the whole transmission is given by @xmath443 , where the first term is from treating receiver 2 s own signal as noise in the first @xmath441 channel uses and the second is from relay transmission during the remaining @xmath442 channel uses . with @xmath444 , @xmath445 ,",
    "this is greater than @xmath446 , the amount of mutual information accumulated at receiver 1 .",
    "note that receiver 1 can only use the first @xmath441 channel outputs to perform decoding in order to achieve @xmath437 , while receiver 2 can defer interference decoding until it receives all @xmath442 channel outputs from relay transmission .",
    "these , combined with the first @xmath441 channel outputs at receiver 2 , jointly resolve interference message .",
    "hence interference can be completely eliminated and @xmath439 is achieved .",
    "we next show that the sum capacity of channel ( [ zric ] ) is less than @xmath447 .",
    "it is easy to see @xmath448 for all @xmath449 .",
    "similar to @xcite , this implies the multi - letter version @xmath450 .",
    "then it is easy to show @xmath451 where ( [ neweq ] ) is due to the fact that gaussian distribution maximizes entropy given covariance constraint and ( [ neweq2 ] ) is because of @xmath444 and @xmath445 .",
    "hence in an independent two - phase operation of the channel , it is impossible for both users to transmit at the maximum rate @xmath440 simultaneously in the first phase , where the decodings must take place by the end of the first phase .",
    "consequently the constrained rates achieved in the two - phase operation is less than @xmath452 , which is required to achieve @xmath436 . therefore @xmath436 is not achievable in the multi - phase scheme .",
    "the above example illustrates that intermediate nodes introduce memory to the channel , which invalidates the optimality of multi - phase operation . similarly transmitter / receiver cooperation or feedback",
    ", could also result in transmitted signals to be dependent on the messages of completed users , making it impossible to decouple different phases of transmissions without losing the optimality .",
    "to simplify the notation , here we drop the argument and simply use @xmath453 to refer to @xmath454 given in the lemma .",
    "@xmath455 , @xmath196 and @xmath456 , @xmath24 , follow similarly .",
