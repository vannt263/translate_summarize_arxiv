    "recently , atlas and cms collaborations have discovered the higgs boson with a mass around 126 gev @xcite , which would be a triumph of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "thus , the status of the sm as the basic theory describing the nature becomes further stabilized .",
    "since the models based on low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) predicted a relatively light higgs mass , one might say that the 126 gev higgs boson supports also susy .",
    "unfortunately , however , any evidence of new physics beyond the sm including susy has not been observed yet at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "it implies that the theoretical puzzles raised in the sm such as the gauge hierarchy problem , which have provided motivations of new physics for last four decades , still remain unsettled .    in fact",
    ", 126 gev is too heavy for a mass of the higgs appearing in the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) .",
    "the basic reason of it is that the tree - level quartic coupling of the mssm higgs potential is given by the small sm gauge couplings unlike the sm . as a consequence ,",
    "the predicted tree - level higgs mass in the mssm is lighter even than the @xmath14 boson mass @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "thus , a large radiative correction for lifting the higgs mass is very essential in the mssm to account for the observed higgs mass .",
    "the dominant radiative correction to the higgs mass in the mssm comes from the top quark yukawa coupling in the superpotential ( @xmath16 ) , because the relevant yukawa coupling constant is large enough ( @xmath17 ) . through the top quark yukawa coupling ,",
    "the top quark and its super - partner , `` stop '' contribute to the radiative higgs mass ( @xmath18 ) and also the renormalization of the soft mass parameter of the higgs @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) @xcite : @xmath21 ,   \\\\ &   \\quad \\delta \\widetilde{m}_2 ^ 2|_{\\rm top}\\approx \\frac{3|y_t|^2}{8\\pi^2}\\widetilde{m}_t^2   ~{\\rm log}\\left ( \\frac{\\widetilde{m}_t^2}{m_g^2}\\right ) \\left[1 + \\frac12\\frac{a_t^2}{\\widetilde{m}_t^2}\\right ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) denotes the top quark ( stop ) mass , and @xmath24 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs , @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",

    "( [ topstop ] ) , @xmath38 is associated with the fine - tuning problem in the higgs sector , since the higgs vev and the resulting @xmath14 boson mass , which define the electroweak ( ew ) scale , are determined by @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) [ and other ( soft ) mass parameters ] .",
    "if @xmath35 is of order tev for the 126 gev higgs mass , thus , a tev scale fine - tuning among the soft parameters is needed to obtain the @xmath14 boson mass of @xmath41 ( `` little hierarchy problem '' ) .",
    "particularly , the `` maximal mixing '' case , @xmath37 makes @xmath42 four times larger than the case of @xmath43 , which aggravates the fine - tuning problem .    in order to mitigate the fine - tuning in the higgs sector , thus ,",

    "] however , the radiative correction by a heavy gluino ( @xmath47 @xcite ) pulls up @xmath35 too much at the ew scale .",
    "thus , the heavy gluino effect should be adequately suppressed for a light stop mass at low energy .",
    "actually it could be compensated e.g. by very heavy squarks of the first and second generations ( @xmath48 ) @xcite through two loop effects @xcite , or by the wino but giving up the assumption of the universal gaugino mass at the gut scale . at the ew scale @xcite . ]",
    "otherwise , one should assume a low messenger scale to minimize the renormalization group ( rg ) effect of a heavy gluino . in this paper",

    "we need other ingredients rather than the stop mass .",
    "as pointed out above , a too light tree - level higgs mass could be a crucial cause of the higgs mass problem in the mssm . in the next - to mssm ( nmssm ) , the `` @xmath32 term '' of the mssm ( @xmath53 )",
    "is promoted to the renormalizable coupling with a new singlet superfield @xmath54 @xcite : @xmath55 it provides an additional quartic term in the higgs potential , @xmath56 , which is absent in the mssm , and so the higgs mass in the nmssm receives a _ tree - level _ correction resulting from that term : @xmath57 accordingly , the higgs mass could be significantly increased even with a relatively light stop , if the dimensionless coupling @xmath4 was of order unity . for @xmath58 , @xmath4 should be larger than @xmath59 with @xmath60 for explaining the observed higgs mass @xcite",

    "the beta function coefficient of the new u(1 ) gauge coupling becomes much larger , which makes the u(1 ) gauge coupling quite smaller at low energies , and so the relaxation mechanism of the lp constraint becomes inefficient .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the yukawa couplings between the newly introduced vector - like leptons and the ordinary mssm higgs were considered for raising the _ radiative _ higgs mass : @xmath66 where @xmath67 ( @xmath1 ) denote extra lepton doublets ( neutral singlets ) , and the last two terms are the mass terms for them @xcite . only if @xmath67 are heavier than @xmath1 , the former can immediately decay to the latter and sm fermions ( plus lsp ) .",
