    "the single electron transistor ( set ) whose operation is based on correlated electron tunneling in small - capacitance double junctions has significantly extended the possibilities of modern experiments .",
    "this remarkable device with sub - electron sensitivity to the charge induced on its central electrode ( island ) has made it possible to study the electron transport and noise processes in various mesoscopic structures ( see , for example , the review by likharev @xcite ) . in recent years , especially after the encouraging experiment by nakamura @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "@xcite , the possibility of using set electrometers for measuring the quantum state of the charge qubit ( cooper - pair box ) has been extensively discussed @xcite . in such measurements both the sensitivity of the detector ( electrometer ) to the input signals and its destructive back - action on the quantum mechanical state of the box",
    "are of prime importance .",
    "the detector s figure of merit , which takes into account the back - action effect , is the energy resolution in the unit bandwidth @xmath3 . according to the quantum mechanical uncertainty principle for a phase - insensitive detector , the figure @xmath4 .",
    "its ultimate value of @xmath5 ( the so - called standard quantum limit - sql ) can be approached by a perfect ( quantum - limited ) device @xcite .",
    "the normal - state metallic set operating in the regime of sequential tunneling of electrons drops out of the category of perfect devices . for the usual case of a high tunneling resistance of junctions @xmath6 ( here",
    "@xmath7  k@xmath8 is the resistance quantum ) , the value @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "one can , in principle , approach sql @xcite by using set with @xmath10 and operating it in the co - tunneling regime at very low voltage bias .",
    "however , in this case the output signal of the electrometer is vanishingly small so that the regime can hardly be practical .",
    "in contrast to the set operating on `` normal carriers '' , i.e. electrons , its superconducting counterpart with appreciable strength of josephson coupling @xmath11 in the junctions , i.e. the bloch transistor @xcite , can operate in the regime of a gate - controlled supercurrent at zero quasiparticle current . in this regime",
    "the charge carriers are the cooper pairs with charge @xmath12 , and their transfer across the junctions occurs without power dissipation in the transistor .",
    "reading - out of the critical current value can be performed by measuring the voltage across the resistor with @xmath13 , shunting the transistor @xcite .",
    "although this electrometer is a quantum - limited device , its implementation still suffers from low conversion factor @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we propose an electrometer with the bloch transistor inserted into a superconducting ring which is inductively coupled to the radio - frequency - driven resonance tank circuit .",
    "in contrast to the so - called rf - set electrometer @xcite based on a charge - dependent dissipation in a resonance circuit containing a normal set , the bloch transistor controls the ac supercurrent in the loop and , hence , the effective reactance of the tank circuit . as a result ,",
    "both the amplitude and phase of oscillations in the tank circuit depend on the island charge .",
    "this mode of electrometer operation is similar to that of a single - junction superconducting quantum interferometer device ( squid ) with small critical current ( non - hysteretic regime ) @xcite .",
    "here we compute the characteristics of our electrometer and demonstrate its potential for qubit measurements .",
    ", an amplifier and an amplitude ( or phase ) detector.,width=307 ]",
    "the equivalent electric diagram of the electrometer comprising the sources of fluctuations is presented in fig .  1 .",
    "the characteristic josephson coupling energies in the first and second junctions of the transistor are assumed to be not very different , @xmath14 ; so we will characterize both of them by the parameter @xmath15 , where @xmath16  wb is the flux quantum and @xmath17 is the nominal critical current of individual junctions .    the charge - sensitive element of the device is the transistor island .",
    "we assume that the total capacitance of the island @xmath18 ( here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the capacitances of the tunnel junctions and the coupling capacitance to the gate , respectively ) is sufficiently small .",
    "the corresponding charging energy @xmath21 , the josephson energy @xmath11 and the energy gap @xmath22 of the superconducting material the transistor made of should obey the condition : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the temperature .",
    "the leftmost inequality ensures blockade of quasiparticle tunneling across the junctions owing to the even - odd parity effect on the superconducting island @xcite .",
    "the relation chosen , @xmath25 , first ensures substantial modulation of the supercurrent in the whole range of variation of the polarization charge on the island , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "secondly , the width of the forbidden band in the energy spectrum ( @xmath27 at @xmath28 ) @xcite is large enough to prevent thermal excitation of higher bloch bands leading to a reduction of the resultant critical current and of the depth of its modulation by the gate . for @xmath29 the critical current of the transistor @xmath30 , with",
    "the value @xmath31 varied in the range from 0.24 ( @xmath32 ) to 0.56 ( @xmath33 ) @xcite .",
    "the supercurrent - charge - phase relation is then approximated by the formula @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "due to finite josephson coupling the effective capacitance of the electrometer island becomes non - linear @xcite .",
    "for @xmath35 its value is @xmath36 , where the factor @xmath37 can be assumed to be constant for moderate @xmath38 .",
    "the inductance @xmath39 of the superconducting ring incorporating the bloch transistor should obey two conditions : @xmath40 the first relation ensures the single - valued dependence of the total flux @xmath41 threading the loop on the external flux @xmath42 applied to the loop ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the constant flux @xmath43 can be induced by dc current through an auxiliary coil ( not shown in fig .  1 ) , while flux @xmath44 is induced by the tank circuit .",
    "for sufficiently small values of @xmath45 , the flux @xmath46 and the josephson phase @xmath47 . the second relation in eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) ensures an exponential smallness of thermodynamic fluctuations of flux @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the josephson phase @xmath49 across the transistor behaves almost as a classical variable whose value and ( small ) fluctuations are determined by current in the tank circuit .",
    "the eigenfrequency of the tank circuit @xmath50 and the frequency @xmath51 of the rf drive @xmath52 should be sufficiently low , i.e. @xmath53 , and , therefore , not excite the bloch transistor by means of an alternative josephson phase @xmath54 . in our model , @xmath49 is considered a slowly - varied parameter in the hamiltonian @xcite of the transistor system . the quality factor is @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the total series resistance of the tank circuit .",
    "the dimensionless coupling coefficient is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the mutual inductance , so that the product @xmath59 a similar regime of operation of single - junction ( rf ) squids , proposed by danilov and likharev @xcite , offers a significant experimental advantage in the sense of a large transfer coefficient @xcite .",
    "the amplifier is characterized by the low active input impedance @xmath60 and uncorrelated sources of voltage ( @xmath61 ) and current ( @xmath62 ) fluctuations @xcite .",
    "these two sources and the source associated with losses in the tank circuit , @xmath63 , have spectral densities @xmath64 respectively , @xmath65 with @xmath66 @xmath67 symbolizing the noise temperature of the amplifier ( temperature of the tank circuit ) in the classical limit @xmath68 . only these three sources of fluctuations",
    "are considered in our model @xcite .",
    "as long as dynamic equations describing the rf - squid were solved elsewhere by the method of harmonic balance @xcite , we skip mathematical details and focus chiefly on the results .    due to large @xmath69 and weak coupling @xmath70 ,",
    "the steady oscillations of the tank circuit current , @xmath71 , and the josephson phase , @xmath72 are quasi - harmonic with slowly varying parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 and constant phase @xmath75 . the dependence of the dimensionless amplitude @xmath76 on detuning @xmath77 is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "at a sufficiently large amplitude @xmath78 of the driving voltage this dependence is multi - valued .",
    "this property allows high values ( theoretically infinite ) of the conversion coefficients `` charge - to - amplitude '' and `` charge - to - phase '' to be realized . because of the shift of the resonance frequency in the tank circuit coupled to the electrometer loop , the effective detuning is @xmath79 .",
    "here , @xmath80 is the bessel function of the first order .",
    "these peculiar curves are typical of the rf - squid ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 governing the transformation of small charge variations @xmath83 into variations of two orthogonal components of ac current in the tank , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , are expressed as @xmath86 the transfer function @xmath87 and dynamic detuning @xmath88 . equation ( [ h_0 ] ) in particular shows that zero magnetic flux @xmath43 giving @xmath89 and , hence , @xmath90 , ensures a maximum of either @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "this is in contrast to the rf - squid operating ultimately at @xmath93 , i.e. at nonzero dc flux @xcite .",
    "the optimum amplitude of the rf - drive should give the value of @xmath94 corresponding to the maximum value of @xmath95 .",
    "for the amplitude ( phase ) detection of a low - frequency signal ( @xmath96 ) , the output resolution in bandwidth @xmath97 , @xmath98 is determined by the spectral density of the in - phase ( out - of - phase ) fluctuations of the current flowing through the amplifier , @xmath99+s_i(\\omega),\\ ] ] where @xmath100 .",
    "the _ output _",
    "noise in the energy representation @xmath101 finally takes the form @xmath102 here , the numerical factor @xmath103 , while @xmath104 for the case of amplitude and phase detection , respectively .",
    "note that , owing to the large value of product @xmath105 ( eq .  ( [ k2ql ] ) ) , the output noise figures @xmath106 ( they do not include the back - action effect ! ) can be made smaller than @xmath5 in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "the electrometer back - action on the source of the input charge is determined by low - frequency ( @xmath108 ) fluctuations of the electric potential of the transistor island @xmath109 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath110 are fluctuations of the josephson phase eq .",

    "( [ fi ] ) it follows that fluctuations @xmath116 are proportional to fluctuations of amplitude @xmath117 ; therefore , these two signals are completely correlated . due to this fact the cross - correlation @xmath118 in the regime of amplitude detection has the largest magnitude which is equal to the geometric mean of @xmath119 eq .",
    "( [ e_u ] ) and @xmath120 with the third term omitted in eq .",
    "( [ e_i ] ) . then the energy resolution of a narrow - band signal @xcite @xmath121^{1 \\over 2}\\ ] ] is equal to @xmath122 \\}}^{1",
    "\\over 2}.\\ ] ]    this equation shows that the electrometer figure of merit @xmath3 depends crucially on the amplifier characteristic @xmath123 . in particular , for @xmath124 and detuning @xmath125 , the figure @xmath126 , and its value approaches the sql of @xmath5 at @xmath127 .",
    "we arrive at the remarkable property of the rf - bloch - electrometer : it converts an input charge into an output signal introducing only insignificant noise on the stage preceding the amplifier .",
    "this is because the device operates as a parametric converter @xmath128 ( similar to the single - junction squid , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "in such a scheme of electrometer ( in contrast to other set electrometers ) the amplifier can be optimized as a _ separate _ block . in the frequency range of @xmath129  mhz ,",
    "the state - of - the - art narrow - band dc - squid - based amplifiers make it possible to almost approach the sql @xcite .",
    "for such an amplifier the required impedance matching with the tank can be carried out by means of a transformer .",
    "the set of experimental parameters for the al transistor can be chosen as follows : @xmath130ev ( corresponds to @xmath131  ff , @xmath132na and @xmath133  ghz @xmath134  mhz ) , @xmath135  nh ( gives @xmath136 and @xmath137  k @xmath138  mk ) , @xmath139 ( bandwidth @xmath140  mhz ) and @xmath141 .",
    "these parameters yield the value @xmath142 that ensures a large transfer coefficient . for the quantum - limited amplifier",
    "the charge resolution is expected to be equal to @xmath143 .",
    "another important conclusion can be drawn regarding a possible `` back - action - evading '' measurement by the rf - bloch - electrometer .",
    "such measurement assumes that one quadrature component of internal noise is `` squeezed '' to less than sql @xcite .",
    "one of the ways to do so is to apply to the tank two driving signals with frequencies @xmath144 and @xmath145 which obey the relation @xmath146 ( see similar proposal for rf - squid in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this",
    "`` degenerate '' mode of operation @xcite the device is sensitive to a quadrature component , say @xmath147 , of the input ac signal @xmath148 whose heisenberg uncertainties obey the relation @xmath149 . as a result ,",
    "one side ( @xmath150 ) of the `` error box '' is squeezed while another ( @xmath151 ) is increased , with their product kept constant .",
    "finally , there is yet another advantage of the rf - bloch - electrometer for qubit measurements : its transducer ( the ring with transistor ) is generically superconducting , the tank circuit should preferably also be made of superconducting material .",
    "this device when positioned near qubit is , therefore , free from the normal - electron excitations which may significantly shorten a decoherence time of qubit .",
