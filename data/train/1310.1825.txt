    "almost all stable nuclei heavier than iron are synthesized by neutron capture reactions during the @xmath6 and @xmath7 process @xcite . however , about 35 neutron - deficient nuclei between @xmath8se and @xmath9hg can be produced neither by the @xmath6 nor the @xmath7 process . they are referred to as @xmath5 nuclei @xcite .    according to current knowledge ,",
    "different mechanisms contribute to the production of @xmath5 nuclei .",
    "several processes are suggested such as the @xmath2 process @xcite , the @xmath10 process @xcite , the @xmath11 process @xcite , and the @xmath12 process @xcite .",
    "the processes are subsumed in here under the heading @xmath5 process .",
    "the current understanding is that the majority of the @xmath5 nuclei are produced by photodisintegration reactions within the @xmath2 process occurring on existing @xmath6- and @xmath7- process seeds @xcite .",

    "the supernova shock wave allows photodisintegration reactions and subsequent @xmath13 decays to produce @xmath5 nuclei .",
    "recent calculations have shown that a significant amount of @xmath5 nuclei can also be produced during type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that lighter @xmath5 isotopes up to @xmath14ru can be co - produced in a high - entropy wind scenario during type ii supernovae @xcite .    since experimental data are scarce , calculations regarding the extensive @xmath2-process reaction network rely almost completely on theoretical reaction rates predicted by the hauser - feshbach ( hf ) statistical model @xcite .",
    "although the hf model itself is well - established , major uncertainties stem from the nuclear physics input parameters entering these calculations .",
    "important experimental efforts have been made during the last years , especially for the intermediate and heavy mass region using the activation method @xcite , which is also used in the present work , as well as the in - beam technique with high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors @xcite and the 4@xmath15 summing method @xcite .",
    "however , especially the description of the @xmath1+nucleus optical model potential ( omp ) remains a problem , experimental data of @xmath1-capture reactions on heavy nuclei for low energies are often overestimated by theoretical predictions .",
    "the @xmath1-omp determines deflections and branchings in the @xmath2-process path and thus has a direct impact on the @xmath5-nuclei abundances .",

    "a variation of the other nuclear properties leaves the cross section unchanged .",
    "a negative value of a sensitivity implies , that the cross section varies inversely proportional to the respective width .",
    "however , the ( @xmath1,@xmath2 ) cross sections within the gamow window are too small to be measured using the activation method within a reasonable time . hence , the measurements had to be performed at energies above the gamow window . within the experimentally accessible energy range above the neutron emission threshold ,",
