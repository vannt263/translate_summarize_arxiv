    "in 1964 , just shortly after the great success of bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory for superconductivity @xcite , fulde and ferrell ( ff ) ferrell64 , and larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite independently demonstrated that a new type of superconducting state , which is characterized by cooper pairs with nonzero total momentum , may exist in certain regime of a clean superconductor under a strong magnetic field .",
    "the order parameters in real space for these two superconductor read as @xmath0 the superconducting state is now known as the fflo superconductor or inhomogeneous superconductor . for conventional bcs superconductors@xcite",
    ", the pairing takes place between electrons with opposite momentum and opposite spin , i.e. , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "therefore when the magnetic field exceeds certain critical value , the superconductivity is destroyed due to pauli paramagnetic depairing effect . as a consequence , magnetism and superconductivity generally can not coexist for the bcs type - i superconductor .",
    "the physics is totally different for fflo phases because these two different orders naturally coexist ; more precisely , the fflo phase arises from the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity .",
    "this important feature makes the fflo phase a central concept for understanding many exotic phenomena in different physics branches , ranging from unconventional solid state superconductors ( e.g. , layered @xcite , heavy - fermion @xcite , organic @xcite superconductors , _",
    "etc_. ) , to chiral quark matter in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and to neutron star glitches in astrophysics @xcite . in the past several decades",
    ", great efforts have been made to unveil this novel quantum phase , and a lot of exotic signatures that may be related to the fflo phase have been observed , for instance , the anisotropic thermal conductivity @xcite , specific heat@xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite , and ultrasound velocities@xcite have been ascribed to the formation of fflo superconductor in the heavy fermion superconductor cecoi@xmath3 . however , until now , clear , unambiguous and direct experimental evidences for the existence of fflo phases are still lacking @xcite .",
    "there are several reasons for that : the existence of fflo phase requires very stringent conditions ; the direct probing of periodic oscillation of the order parameter is challenging ; and the disorder effects in the superconductor induce strong scattering between different momenta that destroys the superconducting pairing @xcite .",
    "the recent experimental advances of population - imbalanced ultracold fermi gases may have the potential to elucidate this long - sought problem .",
    "the ultracold atomic system possesses some remarkable advantages over their counterpart in solid state systems due to its high controllability and tunability @xcite .",
    "the experimental parameters in ultracold atoms can be tuned in realistic experiments .",
    "furthermore , the system can be made disorder free , which if necessary , can be introduced to the system in a controllable manner disorder1 , disorder2 , disorder3 . on the experimental side ,",
    "the superfluidity of the fermi gas can be characterized by the generation of vortices when the gas is rotated@xcite , and the momentum of the cooper pair in the fflo phase can be directly probed using the time - of - flight imaging @xcite , while in solid state the direct observation of the fflo phase and its cooper pair momentum is challenging . unfortunately , this system still have two major obstacles hinder the observation of fflo phase in recently experiments .",
    "firstly , the fflo phase only exists in an extremely narrow parameter regime in 2d and 2d ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - phase]a ) degenerate fermi gases @xcite , therefore in experiments the fflo phase is generally missed out .",
    "for instance , in recent experiments with population - imbalanced fermi gases zwierlein06a , zwierlein06b only the phase transition from bcs superfluids to normal gases has been observed . while in another experiment hulet1 the phase separation phase , which is also known as the breached pair @xcite , has been observed .",
    "secondly , the energy difference between fflo ground state and bcs excited state is much smaller than the temperature , therefore even the parameters for the fflo state have been reached , the fermi gas is still too hot to reach the ground state .",
    "the above two obstacles can be overcome using spin - orbit ( so ) coupled degenerate fermi gases with an in - plane zeeman field . here the so coupling is a central ingredient in modern physics , because it is essential to a number of important concepts in condensed matter physics , ranging from spin hall effect @xcite , anomalous quantum hall effect @xcite , and topological insulators @xcite . in solid materials ,",
    "the so coupling is induced by inversion symmetry of bulk or structure @xcite . however , in cold atom systems , the so coupling is induced by raman coupling between hyperfine states @xcite , therefore in principle , different types of so coupling can be created by carefully choosing different laser configurations .",
    "experimentally , the one dimensional so coupling has been realized using raman coupling between hyperfine states for both bose and fermi gases @xcite , while the in - plane zeeman field naturally exists in this system . here",
    "we show that the combination of a rashba - type of so coupling and an in - plane zeeman field can support fflo superfluids with a unique fflo vector in a 2d degenerate fermi gas .",
    "the required zeeman field or the population imbalance can be extremely small with realistic experimental parameters .",
    "the driving mechanism for the fflo superfluids is the interplay between deformation of fermi surface and superconducting order @xcite , thus should be in stark constrast to the physics in original fflo superconductor @xcite .",
    "recently , there are already several related works showing that the fflo superfluids can be observed with different so couling and zeeman fields @xcite , and all of them belong to the scope of this new driven mechanism . here in this work",
    ", we provide a comprehensive understanding for the formation of fflo superfluids in the so coupled fermi gas from the symmetry of fermi surface .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as following .",

    "the 2d degenerate fermi gases can be constructed by applying a strong standing wave along the third direction , and have been realized in recent experiments @xcite .",

    "the one dimensional so coupling has been realized in fermionic cold atoms@xcite .",
    "the schemes to the realization of two dimensional so coupling are similar , but requires more complicated laser beams , see recent works@xcite .",
    "the last term corresponds to the @xmath10-wave scattering interaction @xmath11where @xmath12 due to the conservation of the total momentum during the scatting process , @xmath13 is the scattering interaction strength .    when atoms form cooper pairs with a finite total momentum @xmath14 , the scattering process in eq .",

    "the interaction term now reduces to @xmath25notice that @xmath26 , thus we have the paring in the real space , @xmath27we see the finite momentum pairing in the momentum space corresponds to a spatially modulated pairing in the real space .",
    "the @xmath28-function arises from the contact interaction .",
    "the above pairing breaks the time - reversal symmetry , which is in consistent with our model because a zeeman field is applied .    using the standard bogoliubov transformation ,",

    "we therefore see the standard mean - field decoupling used in eq .",

    "the so(2 ) symmetry may breakdown in the present of both rashba and dresselhaus so coupling .",
    "however , in this case , the fermi surface still has inversion symmetry , which means that the eigenvalues of single particle hamiltonian have the basic property @xmath78 for any @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this symmetry is unbroken by out - of - plane zeeman field .",
    "the inversion symmetry of fermi surface is most relevant to the physics in this work , and it is exact this symmetry ensures that the bcs phase instead of fflo phase is more energetically favorable in the present of out - of - plane zeeman field .",
    "an intuitive understanding of this result is that for any state with momentum @xmath79 , we can always find another degenerate state with opposite momentum at the same band , thus we have bcs phase .",
    "the so coupling here plays the role of inducing pairing at the same band .",

    "we first illustrate the basic physical picture for the formation of fflo superfluids . for the fermi gas with only zeeman field , see fig .",
    "fig - ideaa , the two mismatched fermi surfaces always form concentric circles , therefore for the @xmath10-wave pairing , the up- and down - spins acquire different fermi momentum , _ i.e. _ , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , with @xmath84 and @xmath85 spins in the pseudospin representation and @xmath14 as the total momentum of the cooper pairs .",
    "the free energy of the system satisfies the following basic property , @xmath86here the zeeman field only fixes the direction of the spin , but does not fix the direction of the momentum axis , therefore the free energy should be invariant under rotation of the momentum @xmath14 .",
    "mathematically , it can also be understood from the fact that the total free energy depends on @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 , thus the summation over @xmath58 should be independent of the direction of @xmath14 , see also ref .",

    "means that the total momentum of the cooper pair can take any direction by spontaneous symmetry breaking , therefore the ground state fflo phase is infinity- fold degenerate . generally in the numerical simulation , we artificially set @xmath14 along a particular direction and demonstrate that the fflo phase indeed has a lower energy than the regular bcs superfluid ( @xmath14 = 0 ) .",
    "due to the pauli paramagnetic depairing effect , the fflo phase only survives in a very narrow parameter regime , see also the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig - phase]a . in realistic system ,",
    "any weak scattering induced by disorder effect can lead weak coupling between the degenerate ground states manifold , making the lo superfluids , which can be regarded as a superposition of the two ff superfluids with total momentum @xmath14 and @xmath90 , as the true ground states , and the lo superfluids still respect the basic symmetry arguement in eq .",
    "[ eq - f ] .",
    "the physical picture is totally different when the so coupling is presented , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - idea]b . in this case",
    "the fermi surface is deformed and the center of the fermi surface is no longer located at @xmath91 , therefore breaks the inversion symmetry .",
    "here we should notice that the deformation of the fermi surface depends strongly on the direction of the so coupling and zeeman field .",
    "for the model we consider here , the deformation is along the @xmath92 direction . in the pseudospin representation ( the eigenstates of single particle hamiltonian ) , we have both singlet pairing and triplet pairing , where the triplet pairing will not be destroyed by strong zeeman field , thus the fflo phase can be observed in a much larger parameter regime .",
    "the deformation of the fermi surface makes the fflo phase always energetically favorable even with a small zeeman field . in our numerics , we find that the fflo vector @xmath14 is along the deformation direction of the fermi surface .",
    "the inversion symmetry breaking directly lead to @xmath93 , which stabilize the ff superfluids against the formation of lo superfluids phase .    generally ,",
    "the mismatch of the fermi surface is the basic route to the fflo phase , and such mismatched fermi surface can be created by population imbalance @xcite , zeeman field @xcite or mass imbalance @xcite . in this work , together with our previous work @xcite , we demonstrate that the fflo phase can be created more efficiently through the deformation of the fermi surface , which can be constructed by so coupling , or , non - abelian gauge field @xcite , and zeeman field . notice that the generation of non - abelian gauge fields is a subject of intensive investigations in ultracold atoms in the past decade , see a recent review in ref .",
    "for this new route , the zeeman field is still needed .",
    "otherwise the system has the time - reversal symmetry and the band structure should satisfy @xmath94 , which means that two fermions with opposite momentum on the fermi surface can always form bcs cooper pairs efficiently ( the pairing is not necessary in the singlet channel ) , leading to bcs superfluids , instead of fflo phases .",
    "our route here , however , shows that the fflo phase may be observed even with small zeeman field ( thus small population imbalance ) .",
    "it therefore represents a new driven mechanism for fflo superfluid .",
    "the order parameter @xmath95 , chemical potential @xmath96 , and the fflo momentum @xmath14 should be solved self - consistently due to the conservation of atom number , i.e. , @xmath97here @xmath95 and @xmath14 are used to minimize the thermodynamical potential @xmath98 .",
    "we consider three different quantum phases : the normal phase with @xmath99 and @xmath19 ( for the normal gas @xmath14 does not enter the effective free energy , thus can be any value .",
    "we force @xmath19 ) ; the bcs - type of superfluid with @xmath19 but @xmath100 ; and the fflo phase with @xmath101 and @xmath102 . when we fix @xmath19 then only bcs type of superfluid phase and the normal gas can be obtained . throughout this work ,",
    "we use two different strategies to check the influence of @xmath14 on the formation of the fflo phase . in the first strategy , we enforce @xmath19 while in the other strategy",
    ", we let @xmath14 as a free parameter .",
    "for the results at @xmath101 , these two strategies yield the energy difference between the fflo ground state and the possible bcs superfluid excited state , which is crucial for the stability of the fflo phase at finite temperature . throughout this work , @xmath103 is used .",
    "because the zeeman field is applied along the @xmath104-axis , the population imbalance should be defined using the eigenstates of @xmath6 , instead of @xmath105 . since @xmath106",

    "notice that in our model , the fflo superfluid can appear with extremely small population imbalance , thus it is driven by the interplay between the deformation of fermi surface and the superconducting order , instead of the original idea of fflo superfluid which arises from the interplay between magnetism and superconducting order .",
    "the new driven mechanism represents a more efficient way to create the fflo superfluid .",
    "to understand the results more clearly , we plot the free energy per particle in the @xmath162 plane , where the global minimum of the free energy marked by the cross symbol in each panel corresponds to the self - consistent solution of eq .",
    "[ eq - eq3 ] .",
    "the left to right shows the nfluence of the so coupling on the formation of the fflo phase , while the top to down shows the influence of the zeeman field .",
    "note that without so coupling , the free energy is a symmetric function of q , therefore in fig .",
    "[ fig - contour]a2 there are two degenerate fflo ground states at @xmath163 because we have assumed @xmath14 is along the @xmath92 direction in our numerical simulation .",
    "this is not true in the real system where the free energy only depends on the magnitude of @xmath164 due to the rotation symmetry , see eq .",
    "[ eq - f ] .",
    "the free energy is still a symmetric function with respect to @xmath129 when @xmath165 .",
    "however it becomes an asymmetric function when both zeeman field and so coupling strength become non - zero , thus only one global minimum can be found in the @xmath162 plane in figs .",
    "[ fig - contour]b2 , c2 , c3 , and the ground state is unique ( hence @xmath14 is unique ) .",
    "the plot of the free energy in the @xmath162 plane directly reflects the effect of the rotational symmetry breaking of the effective hamiltonian . with the increasing zeeman field , the order parameter decreases due to the formation of the fflo phase . due to the increases of @xmath166 , the boundary between fflo phase and normal gas , we observe the fflo phase in the strong zeeman field and strong so coupling region in fig .",
    "[ fig - contour]c3 .",
    "it is well known in solid materials that the lo superfluids , which is the superposition of ff superfluids with total momentum @xmath14 and @xmath90 , is more energetically favorable in realistic systems .",
    "the basic reason is that the deformation of fermi surface is very small , thus @xmath167 . as a results ,",
    "the coupling between ff superfluids with momentum @xmath14 and @xmath90 lead to the formation of lo superfluids with slightly lower energy .",
    "the coupling between different ff superfluids is even significant in the degenerate ground states manifolds .",
    "so it means that the energy difference between @xmath168 and @xmath169 , where @xmath14 is the fflo superfluids momentum obtained using the previous procedures , can be used to qualify whether ff superfluids is more stable than the lo superfluids .",
    "hence we define @xmath170 obviously , when @xmath133 , @xmath171 . on the other hand , @xmath171 when @xmath172 .",
    "note that @xmath139 defined in eq .",

    "[ fig - deltaf]c - d .",
    "we see that the increase of so coupling monotonically increase @xmath129 and hence @xmath173 also increase monotonically",
    ". however , when @xmath174 or @xmath129 has a sudden jump at some point , see fig .",
    "[ fig - deltaf]b , d , then @xmath173 may take a maximum at these points . in the condition with strong zeeman field or large binding energy , the fflo phase is suppressed , therefore @xmath173 approaches zero as the increase of these parameters .",
    "here the most interesting result we observed is that @xmath173 can be as large as 0.1 , and this large energy difference ensures that the ff superfluid phase has much lower energy than the lo superfluid phase .",

    "[ fig - ek]a and fig .",

    "the band structure is symmetric about @xmath91 , but along the @xmath177 direction such symmetry is broken .",

    "note that the gapless excitation is a typical feature of the fflo phase , as have been pointed out in literature @xcite . in the vicinity of the gapless excitation ,",
    "fig - linear , the dispersion becomes linear which is essential to ensure that the fflo phase is robust against the low - energy fluctuations .",
    "here we should emphasize that not all fflo phases are gapless .",
    "the fflo state may become gapless only when @xmath129 is relatively large , while for a small @xmath129 ( near the boundary between fflo and bcs superfluid ) the fflo phase is still gapped , similar to that in the bcs superfluid .",
    "for the normal gas the band structure also shows strong deformation along the @xmath177 axis , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig - ek]e and fig .",
    "[ fig - ek]f .",
    "the corresponding momentum distributions @xmath179 and @xmath180 provide an important tool to detect the properties of the fflo state because they can be directly measured via free expansion of the atomic cloud .",

    "however , the sum of the momentum distributions @xmath181 for spin up and spin down components still shows perfect symmetry about @xmath91 along both @xmath176 and @xmath177 directions .",
    "therefore detecting the asymmetry of the superfluid is not sufficient for the identification of the fflo phase . to identify the superfluid nature of the fflo phase",
    ", we have to rotate the sample to create vortices , which is a direct evidence of superfluidity . near the boundary between difference phases ,",
    "the fluctuation effect may become significant thus the phase boundary region is not suitable for the observation of vortices . with the large fflo phase region in our model we can safely choose some parameters in the middle of the fflo phase region where",

    "after released from a trapping potential , the free expansion of the fermi cloud has a peak at @xmath182 , therefore the direct measurement of the fflo momentum @xmath14 is possible @xcite . in our model when @xmath14 is unique , repeated measurement to determine the fflo momentum becomes possible , see fig .",
    "[ fig - measurement ] .. in the fflo phase without so coupling , the ground state is independent of the direction of @xmath14 , thus only a circle with radius @xmath183 can be observed , see fig . [ fig - measurement ] .",

    "_ ) has been discussed in condensed matter physics in the context of noncentrosymmetric superconductors@xcite , and our observation that @xmath184 perpendicular to the direction of zeeman field as well as the so interaction significantly broadens the fflo phase in parameter space are consistent with that in solids@xcite .",
    "it does not means that the physics in solids and cold atoms are similar or identical . in the following ,",
    "we summarize some of the notable differences between these two totally different systems .",
    "some of these differences have been briefly discussed in our previous work@xcite .",

    "the fflo phase is induced by the interplaying between asymmetry of fermi surface and superconducting order . note that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ratio between so coupling energy and fermi energy is of the order of @xmath185 in the srtio@xmath186/laalo@xmath186 oxide interface , and we expect this new mechanism applies to this solid material . here",
    "we need to emphasize that the basic mechanism for finite momentum pairing in some of the solid materials are still not well theoretically understood due to the complicated spin fluctuating effect , multi - band structure , magnetism , fermi surface nesting and other uncontrollable interactions .",
    "the physics in cold atom system is extremely clear in this sense .",
    "the different driving mechanisms lead to completely different physical results . in solid materials@xcite ,",
    "the broadening of the fflo phase in discussed in the temperature - magnetic field ( @xmath187 ) plane . in ref .",
    "@xcite the broadening of fflo phases mainly comes from the increase of h@xmath188 ( the second critical field between superconductor and normal states ) in solid state materials .",
    "in contrast , the broadening of fflo phases in our work comes from the decrease of the critical zeeman field between bcs superfluids and fflo superfluids , see fig .",
    "[ fig - phase]d and fig .",
    "1d in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in solid materials",
    ", the fflo phase can only be observed in low dimensional systems , in which an external magnetic field parallel to the sample surface can effectively suppress the orbital effect .",
    "the disadvantage is that the fluctuating effect is also significant in low dimensional systems , which is probably one of the basic reasons that why fflo phase is not observed in practical experiments . in cold atom systems ,",
    "the orbital effect is independent of the dimensionality of the system because because the zeeman field is purely induced by raman coupling and detuning of hyperfine states .",
    "therefore the fflo phase can not only be observed in low dimensional systems , but also in three dimensional system@xcite .",
    "the cold atom platform has the additional advantage of disorder free .      in solid materials , @xmath189 , and",
    "the relevant fflo physics occurs in the bcs limit . in cold atom systems for the parameter regime @xmath190",
    ", the fflo phase can be observed in the strong coupling regime , which can be tuned by feshbach resonance ( @xmath191 in this work , and scattering length in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "the relevant interesting physics in cold atom system is the bec - bcs crossover .",
    "the solid state systems and ultra - cold atom systems have very different constraints for the experimental realization and observation of fflo phases .",
    "the following is a comparison : solid state systems :",
    "1 ) temperature is not an issue because of the large fermi energy ; 2 ) disorder is very important and its role is still not well understood ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the influence of disorder on fflo states ) ; 3 ) the fflo phase is hard to observe directly ; 4 ) the scattering effect and associated lifetimes are crucial for fflo phase .",
    "cold atomic systems : 1 ) temperature is important because current experimentally reachable temperature is around 0.05@xmath153 . therefore the energy difference between fflo state and bcs excited state is important , which is shown to be large in our scheme and is one major advantage of our proposal ; 2 ) disorder free ; 3 ) the fflo phase can be observed directly in time of flight images ; 4 ) the system is very stable , and the lifetime issue is unimportant .",
    "the experimental tools in these materials are also quite different . in solids , the thermal conductivity @xcite , specific heat@xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance@xcite , and ultrasound velocities@xcite",
    "are generally used to study the anomalous properties of fflo phase , while in cold atoms , the time - of - flight imaging can be directly used to probe the pairing momentum and associated fermi surface asymmetry . in this sense",
    ", the cold atom platform may provide the most convincing evidence for the formation of finite momentum pairing .",
    "to summarize , in this paper we study the possible fflo phase in so coupled degenerate fermi gases with in - plane zeeman fields .",
    "we show that the parameter region for the fflo phase can be greatly enlarged due to the deformation of the fermi surface .",
    "the emergence of the fflo phase is explained from different angles .",
    "the properties of the bcs superfluid , fflo phase and normal gas have also been discussed and their measurement through the time - of - flight imaging is presented .",
    "our results indicate that the deformation of the fermi surface provides a more efficient method to generate the fflo phase .",
    "because the so coupling has been realized in bose @xcite and fermi @xcite cold atom gases in experiments , where the in - plane zeeman field can be naturally created @xcite and tuned , we expect the idea in this work may provide a path for elucidating the long - standing problem about fflo phases in experiments in the near future .",
