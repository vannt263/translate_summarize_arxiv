    ", the x - ray afterglow has been studied in great detail , placing tighter constraints on models for grb emission . additionally , _",
    "swift _ has enabled the detection of short grb ( sgrb ) x - ray afterglows , allowing them to be directly compared to long grb ( lgrb ) afterglows @xcite . @xcite and @xcite described the `` canonical grb light curve '' as three stages comprising a steep decline followed by a shallower decay and then a final decay phase .",
    "@xcite showed that not all x - ray light curves for grbs are of the `` cannonical '' variety .",
    "they and @xcite suggested that the x - ray light curve comprises two main components , the prompt emission and the afterglow .",
    "the relative strength of these components determines the observed x - ray light curve .",
    "a more recent study of all _ swift _ x - ray afterglows by @xcite has reinforced these findings .",
    "the initial steep decay following the prompt emission typically has a power law decay with index @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( t is the time after the burst in seconds and f is the flux ) @xcite .",
    "multi - wavelength observations have associated lgrbs with type ibc core collapse supernovae at cosmological distances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although not all such supernovae produce long grbs @xcite .",
    "the progenitors of sgrbs are less well understood , but the most popular theory is that they originate from the merger of compact binary systems , for example neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that both lgrb and sgrb progenitors could produce an unstable millisecond pulsar .",
    "this is expected to contribute a small fraction of the grb population @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite found examples of lgrbs that have an observable plateau and steep decay in the x - ray light curve , which have been intepreted as caused by energy injection by an unstable millisecond pulsar which then collapses .",
    "magnetar models have also been proposed to explain late central engine activity in sgrbs , for example late time plateaus in the x - ray afterglows @xcite and x - ray flares @xcite . here",
    "we present an analysis of grb 090515 which is the best case for an early x - ray plateau in an sgrb .",
    "grb 090515 was one of the shortest grbs observed by _",
    ", with among the lowest fluence , yet for @xmath4200 s it had the brightest sgrb x - ray afterglow and did not appear to be fading until a sudden steep decline at @xmath4 240 s. after the first orbit , it was not detected again . explaining this unusual x - ray behaviour is the subject of this paper .",
    "we describe the observations of grb 090515 in section 2 , compare it to other grbs in section 3 and discuss the potential origin of the unusual x - ray emission in section 4 . throughout the paper",

    "typically sgrbs have negligble lag times @xcite and lgrbs have typical lag times ranging from 20 ms to @xmath41000 ms @xcite , so it is interesting that grb 090515 appears to have a small lag time .",
    "the x - ray spectrum in the 0.3  10 kev energy band is best fit by an absorbed power law with @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath3 , in excess of the galactic @xmath26 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray light curve is best fit by a broken power law with 2 breaks giving a reduced @xmath27 of 0.86 .",

    "grb 090515 is shown with a filled circle . as expected , the higher fluence grbs tend to have higher flux x - ray afterglows .",
    "grb 090515 is an exception to this alongside grb 070724a ; both of these bursts have an unusually high initial x - ray flux for their fluence . in figure [ fig4](a ) , we compare the combined bat - xrt light curves of grb 090515 and grb 070724a .",
    "the initial xrt flux of 070724a appears to be consistent with flares ( as there is a varying hardness ratio ) and an underlying broken power law decay .",
    "there is no obvious plateau phase for grb 070724a , but this may have occurred prior to the xrt observations .",
    "the steep decay phase of grb 070724a , with @xmath49 is much shallower than the steep decay of grb 090515 .",
    "additionally , the optical afterglow of grb 070724a had a magnitude of @xmath50 at 2.3 hours after the burst , corresponding to a flux of @xmath51 erg @xmath3 s@xmath9 hz@xmath9 , with an associated host galaxy @xcite .",
    "this flux is almost an order of magnitude larger than the optical afterglow of grb 090515 at 1.7 hours and grb 090515 does not have an identified host galaxy .",
    "however , grb 070724a does share many similarities with grb 090515 so we can not rule out the possibility that they originate from a similar progenitor .",
    "figure [ optical_lcs](a ) shows the lightcurves for the observed r band optical afterglows associated with sgrbs ( published values converted from magnitudes into flux density in jy ) , grb 090515 is the faintest observed and one of the earliest detections after the trigger time . in figure [ optical_lcs](b )",
    "we have divided the optical fluxes by the xrt flux at 1000 s after the trigger time .",
    "when we have considered the xrt flux at 1000 s , the optical afterglow of grb 090515 is not unusually faint compared to other sgrbs .",
    "we also show the optical light curve for grb 080503 ( a short burst with extended emission * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in figure [ optical_lcs](c ) in comparison to grb 090515 .",
    "as the fluence of grb 090515 in the 15  150 kev energy band was one of the lowest fluences observed for sgrbs , here we compare it to other low fluence grbs .",
    "grb 050509b and grb 050813 were short grbs detected by the _",
    "swift _ satellite that were similar to grb 090515 during the prompt emission phase .",
    "however , the combined bat and xrt light curves for grbs 050509b and 050813 , shown in figure [ fig4](b ) , do not show the same x - ray plateau extending to @xmath4200 s after the burst .",
    "grbs 050509b and 050813 have both been used to place constraints on the compact binary merger model of sgrbs @xcite .",
    "the observed upper limits for grb 090515 at late times ( after 400s ) are consistent with the later emission observed for grbs 050509b and 050813 .",
    "this suggests that the plateau and steep decay are an additional component in the light curve of grb 090515 .",
    "grb 051105 is a sgrb with an identical fluence to grb 090515 , but its afterglow was undetectable by xrt in observations starting 68 s after the burst @xcite .",
    "grb 070209 had the lowest sgrb fluence and was also undetectable by xrt in observations starting 78 s after the burst @xcite .    in figure [ fig4](c ) ,",
    "the x - ray light curve of grb 090515 is compared to the two lowest fluence lgrbs in the _ swift _ sample which were detected by xrt .",
    "these are grb 080520a and grb 060717a , they both have significantly higher fluence in the 15  150 kev band than grb 090515 ( due to having longer durations ) , but are a lot fainter in x - rays , again suggesting additional x - ray emission in grb 090515 .",
    "it is possible that these grbs had plateau phases which end prior to the xrt observations .",
    "however , as _ swift _ slewed promptly to these grbs ( observations typically starting within 100 s ) , a plateau phase would need to be significantly shorter than that observed for grb 090515 .",
    "the main exception to this is grb 060717a , which had xrt observations begining when grb 090515 was in the steep decay phase .",
    "the grb with an x - ray light curve most similar to grb 090515 is grb 090607 , which has a @xmath0 just above the short - long boundary .",
    "they are compared in figure [ fig4](d ) .",
    "both light curves show a distinctive steep decay at @xmath4200s .",
    "however , the emission of grb 090607 between 80 and 100 s is not a plateau as observed in grb 090515 and , given the hard spectrum which softens as the emission decays ( shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig4](d ) ) , is more likely due to a flare at the start of the xrt observations .",
    "the steep decay in the unusual x - ray light curve of grb 090515 can not be explained using the external shock afterglow models .",
    "instead , we consider if this grb was a naked burst with faint , rapidly fading emission , and if the x - ray plateau is powered by an unstable millisecond pulsar .",
    "these possibilities are discussed below .",
    "if a grb occurs in a very low density ism then the afterglow from external shocks between the jet and the ism could be too faint for detection by _",
    "swift_. instead , there would just be the prompt emission followed by a rapid decline due to the `` curvature effect '' @xcite .",
    "this predicts a decay in flux described by : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the observed spectral energy index at frequency @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , and t is the time since the trigger . we should observe a decay @xmath56",
    "we compare here grb 090515 with a good candidate for a naked burst , grb 050421 @xcite .",
    "grb 050421 was a weak long grb detected by bat following a steep decay , as shown in figure [ fig4](e ) , although the decay is not as steep as for grb 090515 .",
    "there is evidence of spectral evolution , as the emission is getting softer ( the lower panel of figure [ fig4](e ) ) ; however , the spectral evolution is during the steep decay and not the plateau region .",
    "the initial hardness ratio for ( 1.5  10 ) kev/(0.3  1.5 ) kev is 6 times larger for grb 050421 than grb 090515 .",
    "@xcite explained the steep decay ( @xmath57 ) of grb 050421 by assuming it was a `` naked burst '' , i.e. there was no forward shock component of the afterglow as the interstellar medium ( ism ) was not dense enough for the shock wave to produce a typical afterglow .",
    "the detected decaying emission is consistent with the `` curvature effect '' .",
    "grb 080503 , shown in figure [ fig4](e ) , has also been explained as a short `` naked burst '' with extended emission detected in the bat ( although not a plateau ) , the x - ray decay is consistent with the `` curvature effect '' @xcite .",
    "however , the steep decay for both of these are significantly shallower than the decay of grb 090515 , which was @xmath589 ( with t@xmath47 at the start of the prompt emission ) .",
    "grb 090515 shares some similarities with grb 050421 and grb 080503 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the burst duration , observed by bat , represents the duration that the jet is relativistic and , with a non - relativistic ( or less relativistic ) jet , the central engine can be active for longer than this time and may be observed by xrt .",
    "therefore , the x - ray plateau observed for grb 090515 could be a continuation of the prompt emission , which has fallen below the threshold of bat .",
    "so with a more sensitive detector , grb 090515 may have been identified as a lgrb .",
    "if true , we should expect to see that the steep decay matches the `` curvature effect '' like grb 050421 . during the plateau , the spectral index @xmath59 is @xmath60 predicting a steep decay slope of @xmath61 .",
    "as the observed decay is significantly steeper than this , it does not fit the `` curvature effect '' theory . using the method described by @xcite",
    ", we shifted the t@xmath47 to the possible flare at the end of the plateau in grb 090515 .",
    "the steep decay becomes less extreme , @xmath62 , but still steeper than the predicted decay slope .",
    "this method relies on correctly identifying the time at which the central engine is last active and with a plateau in the light curve this point is difficult to identify .",
    "the steep decay of grb 090515 following the plateau may be consistent with the `` curvature effect '' if a later location of t@xmath47 is identified . alternatively , this could be associated with a narrow opening angle for the jet which creates the plateau , as in that case outside of 1/@xmath63 there would be very little high latitude emission , giving a much steeper decay slope .",
    "it is also possible that the spectrum softens immediately prior to the steep decay , however we do not have enough observed counts to produce a reliable x - ray spectrum at this time .",
    "grb 090515 can potentially be explained as an under - luminous naked long grb , however this is reliant on the assumption that the plateau is powered by prolonged activity in the central engine .",
    "the bright x - ray plateau in the light curve of grb 090515 could be associated with the formation , emission and collapse of a millisecond pulsar .",
    "there have been predictions that in some grbs an unstable millisecond pulsar may be formed @xcite . at formation",
    ", there is enough rotational energy to prevent gravitational collapse .",
    "this energy can be released as electromagnetic radiation or gravitational waves , causing the pulsar to spin down until it reaches a critical point at which it is no longer able to support itself . at this point",
    "the pulsar collapses to a black hole and the emission stops",
    ". this would be evident in the x - ray light curve as a plateau caused by energy injection from the millisecond pulsar followed by an extremely steep decay when the pulsar collapses .",
    "we might expect millisecond pulsars formed during the core collapse of a massive progenitor star to be associated with long grbs and this has been suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "grb 090515 was an extremely short grb , but a millisecond pulsar could be formed by two merging neutron stars ( a potential progenitor of sgrbs ) , depending on various assumptions about the neutron stars equations of state @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite studied lgrbs with a plateau and a steep decay and grb 090515 shows similarities to them . in figure [ fig4](f ) , we compare the light curve of grb 090515 to that of grb 070616 @xcite , one of the sample chosen by @xcite as potentially showing evidence of an unstable millisecond pulsar . when comparing the light curves , grb 070616 appears to be a brighter and longer version of grb 090515 but with a bright afterglow component at later times .",
    "we have used the following equations from @xcite ( equations [ period ] and [ luminosity ] ) to determine if grb 090515 could be a millisecond pulsar , using @xmath64 , the rest frame duration of the plateau in units of @xmath65 s , and @xmath66 , the luminosity of the plateau in units of @xmath67 erg s@xmath9 , in the rest frame energy band 1  1000kev .",
    "the equations are rearranged to give equations [ b^2 ] and [ p^2 ] , these are used to predict the magnetic field strength and the spin period of a pulsar formed by this method .",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath69 is the moment of inertia in units of @xmath70 g @xmath71 , @xmath72 is the magnetic field strength at the poles in units of @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the radius of the neutron star in @xmath75 cm and @xmath76 is the initial period of the compact object in milliseconds .",
    "these equations apply to the electromagnetic dominated spin down regime , as the gravitational wave dominated regime would be extremely rapid and produce a negligble effect in our analysis .",
    "we could assume , as in @xcite , that we can use standard values for a neutron star so that @xmath77 and @xmath78 which may be appropriate for a collapsar .",
    "however , as we would be forming an unstable millisecond pulsar by merging two neutron stars the true values may be different , depending on the mass and equation of state . for a millisecond pulsar formed by a binary merger",
    ", we can take the mass of the neutron star to be m@xmath792.1m@xmath80 @xcite and estimate @xmath81 .",
    "although grb 090515 has many properties similar to other sgrbs suggesting the progenitor is most likely a compact binary merger , there have been predictions that collapsars may also produce a sgrb ( for example from an orphan precursor jet , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and evidence that a significant fraction of sgrbs are related to collapsars rather than compact binary mergers @xcite .",

    "the moment of inertia , given in equation [ inertia ] , is based on the assumption that the neutron star can be modelled as an uniform sphere .",
    "@xmath94    this constraint on radius and moment of inertia for a given mass can be substituted into equations [ b^2 ] and [ p^2 ] to define a forbidden region for a given neutron star mass , plateau duration and luminosity .",
    "the forbidden region is described by equations [ b2 ] and [ p2 ] and is shown in figure [ fig16](b ) for grb 090515 assuming a mass of @xmath95 , for a collapsar progenitor ( red curved line ) , and @xmath96 , for a binary merger progenitor ( red curved dashed line ) .",
    "@xmath97    it has been suggested that the radii of proto neutron stars may be as large as a few tens of kilometers @xcite , so in figure [ fig16](c ) we show the effect of increasing the radius , from 10 km to 30 km , for a mass of 1.4@xmath82 , using the plateau luminosities and durations previously calculated for grb 090515 assuming it is at a range of redshifts . for larger radii ,",
    "the unstable millisecond pulsar has to be at higher redshifts , have a smaller magnetic field and larger period .",
    "as we have an r - band detection of the optical afterglow , we can place the upper - limit z@xmath895 on the redshift .    in figure [ fig16b ]",
    ", we investigate the effect of the different beaming angles considered by @xcite assuming a mass of 1.4@xmath82 . as the causality",
    "forbidden region shown in figure [ fig16](b and c ) also depends on beaming angle we have reverted to using the regions defined by @xcite for clarity . up to this point",
    ", we have only considered isotropic emission and this shows beaming the emission would greatly affect the results obtained .",
    "simulations have shown that a relativistic jet can be produced by a magnetar @xcite .",
    "if the emission was beamed by 4 degrees the observations would not support the magnetar model . with a beaming angle of 18 degrees , grb 090515",
    "would need a redshift of @xmath98 in order to satisfy the model and the constraints obtained by observing an optical afterglow .",
    "the more tightly the emission is beamed , the higher the redshift that the burst would need to be at in order to fit the magnetar model and this may explain why a host galaxy has not been identified .    .",
    "solid lines show isotropic solution and the solutions for the two beaming angles considered in @xcite .",
    "the dotted lines represent contours of equal redshift decreasing from left to right .",
    "the forbidden regions are as defined for figure [ fig16](a).,width=317 ]",
    "grb 090515 is a very unusual sgrb , as its low gamma - ray fluence would lead us to expect a significantly fainter x - ray light curve than observed at early times .",
    "most importantly , the x - ray plateau followed by an extremely steep decay is very unusual , but may not be unique in the _ swift _ sample . with a more sensitive detector , the plateau observed by xrt may have instead been identified as part of the prompt emission and grb 090515 might instead have been classified as a lgrb .",
    "therefore , it poses interesting questions about the progenitor model and for the classification of other grbs . in this paper , we have considered the two popular progenitor models for grbs , collapsars and compact binary mergers .",
    "grb 090515 is the first sgrb with a fluence below @xmath99 erg @xmath3 with an observed optical afterglow at 1.75 hours ( r=26.4@xmath10.1 ) , and this is the faintest detected optical afterglow for a grb at that time .",
    "we suggest that the simplest explanation for the unusual light curve of grb 090515 is that it shows prolonged emission from an unstable millisecond pulsar , followed by an extremely steep decay when the millisecond pulsar collapses .",
    "given the short duration of the grb and the other properties , we favour the binary merger progenitor but can not rule out a collapsar progenitor . for a collapsar progenitor , the proposed unstable millisecond pulsar with a spin period of 10 ms would have a magnetic field of @xmath100 g at z @xmath4 0.3 and with a spin period of 1 ms the magnetic field would be @xmath101 g at z @xmath4 3.5 . the binary merger progenitor model gives a spin period of 10 ms and a magnetic field of @xmath102 g at z @xmath4 0.2 to a spin period of 66 ms and a magnetic field of @xmath103 g at z @xmath4 4.4 .",
