    "in the standard cosmological model , the large - scale structure in the density field grows from small initial perturbations through the mechanism of gravitational instability .",
    "statistical measures of this structure can be used to both verify the growth mechanism ( see e.g. , bernardeau 2002 and references therein ) and quantify the initial pertubations . a different kind of growth of structure is expected when we consider the neutral hydrogen density field during the epoch of reionization ( see e.g. , the review by loeb & barkana 2001 ) . in this case , bubbles of ionized material form first around bright sources and grow as the ionization fronts overlap until the universe is fully ionized .",
    "statistical measures applied to this `` radiation induced structure '' ( hereafter ris ) can be used in a similar way to the gravitational instability picture above , but this time to verify the process of reionization and the nature of the sources of radiation .",
    "the effect of ris is likely to be qualitatively different from that of gravity , and as a result the statistical signatures will be different . our aim in this paper is to explore the differences , using ray traced simulations of reionization .",
    "we aim to both find out how reionization is different from gravity in the way it forms structure and how to use these differences to categorize reionization scenarios .",
    "the statistical properties of ris have been explored in many other works , e.g. , using the power spectrum of hi fluctuations by furlanetto ( 2004 ) , zaldarriaga ( 2004 ) , morales & hewitt ( 2004 ) , and using minkowski functionals by gleser ( 2006 ) . in the present paper",
    "we will focus on the autocorrelation function .",
    "theoretical studies of reionization include both analytic work , e.g. , miralda - escud ( 2000 ) , wyithe & loeb ( 2003 ) , cen ( 2003 ) , liu ( 2004 ) , furlanetto ( 2004 ) , and numerical simulations , e.g. , razoumov & scott ( 1999 ) , abel ( 1999 ) , gnedin ( 2000 ) , ciardi ( 2001 ) , sokasian ( 2001 ) , razoumov ( 2002 ) , sokasian ( 2004 ) .",
    "recently , n - body simulations with radiative transfer post processing have been performed by iliev ( 2006 ) , and zahn ( 2007 ) with box sizes as large as @xmath7 and able to resolve halos down to masses of @xmath8 .",
    "kohler ( 2007 ) have performed simulations with an extremely large box size ( up to @xmath9 ) in which hydrodynamics and radiative transfer are coupled self consistently .",
    "these simulation rely on higher resolution simulations to calibrate the sub grid ( @xmath10 ) physics .",
    "other recent advances in simulating reionization include the work of trac & cen ( 2006 ) , a hybrid n - body dark matter and rt approach , a code which was used to study the growth of bubbles during reionization by shin ( 2007 ) .",
    "analytic work has been carried out using perturbation theory to predict inhomogeneities in the density of neutral hydrogen and photons ( zhang 2007 ) , as well as press - schechter based analyses ( e.g. , furlanetto 2004 . )",
    "most relevant to the work here , the autocorrelation function of 21 cm emission has been examined in analytic models by wyithe & morales ( 2007 ) and barkana ( 2007 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we do not aim to simulate particular observational probes of this epoch , such as the doppler scattering of cmb photons on relativistic electrons , or the 21 cm emission from neutral hydrogen .",
    "instead , we concentrate on the differences between @xmath11 for the density field and the density field modulated by ris . in principle",
    ", this will be directly observable in the future , through the various observational probes ( e.g. , carilli 2004 , peterson 2005 , valds 2006 ) we leave exploration of this to future work .",
    "the format of this paper is as follows . in  2 we describe the simulations , including the n - body outputs and the radiative transfer code .",
    "we also describe our different models for the sources of ionizing radiation and different physical conditions we simulate . in ",
    "3 we show how global properties such as the mean ionized fraction evolve as a function of redshift in the different runs , and then in  4 examine the morphology of the neutral and ionized hydrogen density field . in ",
    "5 we measure the autocorrelation function in our different models and explore how it can differentiate between them .",
    "we summarise our results and discuss them in ",
    "we work in the context of the standard cosmological constant dominated universe , with parameters @xmath12 , @xmath13 @xmath14 , and a hubble constant @xmath15 .",
    "the initial linear power spectrum is cluster - normalised with a linearly extrapolated amplitude of @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "the radiative transfer is carried out as post - processing on n - body simulation outputs .",
    "we run our n - body simulations with the cosmological hydrodynamic code gadget ( springel 2001 ) .",
    "our fiducial simulation is run in a @xmath18 cubical volume .",
    "iliev ( 2006 ) have shown in tests using subvolumes of a larger ( 100 @xmath19 ) simulation that @xmath20 is the smallest box side length for which the scatter in reionization histories in different volumes is reasonably small .",
    "we use @xmath21 dark matter and @xmath21 gas particles .",
    "the mass resolution is therefore @xmath22 for gas particles and @xmath23 for dark matter .",
    "we also run higher resolution models in tests , as detailed below .",
    "we do not include radiative cooling or star formation when computing the gas dynamics so that our simulations are similar to those carried out by sokasian ( 2001 ) .",
    "we run the rt as postprocessing , so that there is no coupling between the hydrodynamics and radiation . in this respect ,",
    "the gas serves to trace the dark matter distribution closely ( there is little difference at these high redshifts . ) we chose our sources of radiation to be associated with dark matter haloes ( see below ) .",
    "in addition to the fiducial run , we run another model with identical box size and particle number but with different random initial phases in order to roughly indicate the effect of simulation cosmic variance .",
    "we also run a model with a different amplitude of mass fluctuations ( @xmath24 . ) for resolution tests , we run a simulation with @xmath25 gas and dark matter particles in a box of size @xmath26 ( the same mass resolution as the fiducial run ) and a simulation with @xmath21 gas and dark matter particles in a box of size @xmath26 ( eight times better mass resolution than the fiducial run ) .",
    "all models were started at @xmath27 and run until @xmath28 .",
    "we output snapshots of the density field every 25 myr , so that there are approximately 40 snapshot files per run .      after choosing models for the sources of radiation ( see below )",
    "we carry out raytracing simulations of radiative transfer ( rt ) to study the evolution of the neutral hydrogen density .",
    "the code we use to do this carries out monte carlo rt to follow photon packets through the distribution of matter .",
    "the code is based on that used by croft ( 2004 ) to study the fluctuating radiation background field at lower redshift but incorporates time dependent rt in a monte carlo manner similar to the crash code of maselli ( 2003 ) ( we actually only treat hydrogen here , so we are in fact closer to the earlier work of ciardi ( 2001 ) .",
    "the code in the present paper traces directly through the sph particle kernels ( see also kessel - deynet & burkert , 2000 , susa , 2006 , yoshida 2007 , and daqle 2007 , for non grid based radiative transfer , and semelin 2007 , and oxley & woolfson 2003 for sph codes that trace through a barnes - hut tree ) and so requires no regridding of the density field between outputs . the spatial resolution of the rt is therefore in principle higher in dense regions than would be possible with a uniform grid .",
    "this approach is described in detail in altay ( 2007 ) , where test problems are carried out .",
    "we also outline some of the relevant features of the code briefly below .    in the present paper we model",
    "only the hydrogen component of the universe ( assumed to comprise 0.76 of the baryonic mass ) .",
    "we also do not explicitly follow the temperature evolution of the gas , beyond taking temperatures of particles to be @xmath29 k when they are ionized and @xmath30 when they are not .",
    "we follow collisional ionization , photoionization and recombinations using the rates given in cen ( 1992 ) .",
    "we randomly sample source photons from a power law distribution , @xmath31 , of photon energies ( more details on the sources are given in section 2.3 , below . ) in the present work , photon packets are monochromatic and are emitted isotropically from sources , again using a random number generator to pick directions .",
    "every time a ray is traced through a particle , the number of recombination photons which have been produced in that particle since the last time it was visited are added to a stack .",
    "when the stack size reaches one packet , a recombination photon packet is emitted from the particle where this occurs .",
    "the frequency of the recombination radiation is given by the milne relation ( osterbrock , 1989 . )",
    "we have one numerical code parameter , @xmath32 which sets the size of the photon packet , and therefore the time resolution of the code .",
    "this parameter @xmath32 is the number of fully neutral simulation gas particles which could be ionized by one photon packet if the energy in that packet was split up into 13.6 ev photons .",
    "for example , if a packet consists of @xmath33 13.6 ev photons and a gas particle contains @xmath34 neutral hydrogen atoms then @xmath35 . by trying runs with different values of @xmath32",
    "we change how well the code can resolve the recombination timescale by governing the average interval between rays visiting particles and updating their ionization states .",
    "packets of recombination radiation as well as source radiation are governed by @xmath32 so that shot noise arising from the discreteness of recombination modelling can be controlled .",
    "we choose a suitable value of @xmath32 by carrying out convergence tests ( see e.g. , ",
    "5.1 ) . in practice",
    "we find that @xmath36 is adequate for modelling clustering of hi and is the value we use in our fiducial simulations .",
    "this results in from @xmath37 photon packets being used in each of the runs .    the paper altay ( 2007 )",
    "is mainly concerned with presenting a closely related code , the publically available code sphray , which has many additional features to the one used in this paper , including the ability to model temperature evolution and helium species .",
    "eventually , observations of the ris at the epoch of reionization will be useful as probes of the sources of radiation as well as cosmology .",
    "the statistical measures of this structure are likely to be correlated with the properties of the sources , their luminosities , lifetimes , and clustering .",
    "one of the goals of this paper is to study the ris produced by various extremely simple models for the ionizing source population , in order to see how they can be differentiated ( principally through the autocorrelation function , which we focus on ) and which features appear to be generic to the models considered .",
    "the range of possible sources for reionization is extremely wide , including decaying dark matter ( e.g. , mapelli 2006 ) , primordial black holes ( ping & fang 2002 , ricotti 2007 ) , high redshift miniquasars ( e.g. , madau 2004 ) , population iii stars ( e.g. , sokasian 2004 ) , population ii stars ( e.g. , sokasian 2003 ) , some more or less likely than others .",
    "rather than attempting to simulate particular models in detail , we restrict ourselves to simply parametrized models which relate the ionizing radiation intensity directly to the dark matter distribution .",
    "this is on the understanding that in most reasonable models of reionization there would be some relationship between the two ( either through galaxies and stars associated with dark matter overdensities , or directly through dark matter clumps decaying to ionizing photons ) .",
    "in particular , we associate sources of radiation to dark matter halos .",
    "this approach has been used also by mellema ( 2006 ) , who use a constant mass to light ratio to assign ionizing radiation to each halo , as well by zahn ( 2007 ) , who populate each halo with a single ionizing source whose luminosity is proportional to host halo mass .",
    "mcquinn ( 2006 ) have also simulated 17 different variations of this type of model with various ionizing photon efficiencies , prescriptions for feedback and and minihalos .",
    "mcquinn ( 2006 ) focus on the morphology of hii regions .",
    "all the runs we use for the main studies in this paper have a simulation box length of @xmath18 and particle number of @xmath38 , although as explained in  2.1 , for resolution studies we have some runs with different mass resolutions and box sizes .",
    "we find halos using a standard friends - of - friends routine , with a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation .",
    "the minimum halo mass we use as a source in our fiducial run is @xmath39 , containing only 8 ( gas and dark matter ) particles .",
    "this is approaching the scale of mini halos expected to host numerous weak ionizing sources and provide small scale clumpiness to the igm , but as with the calculations of zahn ( 2007 ) ( who do have a smaller particle mass ) it is still approximately an order of magnitude too large .",
    "although we only resolve such halos with a small number of particles , we have checked using simulations with 8 times better mass resolution ( see  5.1 ) that this does not affect our computation of the autocorrelation function of neutral hydrogen , the statistic we focus on . in general , the limited mass resolution of simulations will affect results both through the absence of sinks ( minihalos ) and sources hosted by small halos .",
    "recent simulations ( e.g. , santos 2007 ) are beginning to address this directly through increases in simulation particle number .",
    "we return to this point in  5.1 and  6.2 .",
    "we use the same density field for 10 of the 12 main runs , carrying out the rt as postprocessing using different source prescriptions .",
    "the other two are a low fluctuation amplitude model ( @xmath24 ) run with the same random phases and another model with the same amplitude as the fiducial case but with different phases .",
    "the 12 runs are differentiated by their different halo mass to light ratios , treatment of the relationship between halo mass and ionizing radiation , the recombination rate , and spectrum of radiation .",
    "an overview is given in table [ runs ] , and they are descibed in detail below .",
    "we label the different simulations by short descriptive names rather than numbers or letters in order to avoid the necessity of the reader referring back to a table when examining the results .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath40 the * fiducial * run . here",
    "the instantaneous luminosity of sources is proportional to the dark matter halo mass , with @xmath41 in our fiducial run , we take @xmath42erg / s/@xmath43 , and a source spectrum with @xmath44 , appropriate for population ii stellar sources ( e.g. , sokasian 2003 ) .",
    "this simple model is also used by zahn ( 2007 ) , who assume a number of photons proportional to halo mass , ( with a conversion factor @xmath45 photons / sec/@xmath43 . )",
    "this corresponds to our fiducial model having a luminosity per halo mass 4 times larger than that of zahn . using the computation of zahn , the source output of our fiducial model can be considered to be very roughly equivalent to one with population ii stars forming with an efficiency of @xmath46 from a salpeter imf , with a stellar lifetime of @xmath47 yrs and an escape fraction of @xmath48 .",
    "the recombination rate in the fiducial simulation is taken to be that computed directly from the gas density , and diffuse recombination photons are treated .",
    "@xmath40 runs * l/2 , l/4 * and * l/8*. these are the same as the fiducial run in every respect except that the ionizing luminosity has been reduced by an overall factor of 2,4 or 8 .",
    "these models can be considered to be equivalent to for example reducing the efficiency of star formation , and/or the ionizing escape fraction with respect to the fiducial run .",
    "the l/4 model therefore corresponds to the model simulated by zahn ( 2007 ) .",
    "* l indep m * we use the same halo list as the fiducial run , but instead of a luminosity proportional to halo mass , we assign the same luminosity to all halos . the total integrated luminosity to @xmath49 is set to be equal to that in the fiducial run .    @xmath40 * m @xmath50 10@xmath51 @xmath43 , m @xmath52 10@xmath51 @xmath43 * for these two runs , the same halo source list is used as in the fiducial run , but with either an upper or lower cutoff applied in the mass of a halo which can host a source . as in the previous model above , the total integrated luminosity to @xmath49 is set to be equal to the fiducial run .",
    "these runs can be considered to roughly model the effects of feedback which might cause disruption of galaxy sources in small halos .",
    "@xmath40 * @xmath24 * this run is the same as the fiducial run , except using a simulation which has a significantly lower amplitude of mass fluctuations , leading to later halo formation times .",
    "the source luminosity was proportional to the halo mass in the same fashion as for the fiducial run , also with @xmath42erg / s/@xmath43 . the total integrated luminosity to @xmath49 is therefore less than in the fiducial run .",
    "@xmath40 * no recomb , 2@xmath53 recomb * in these runs , the recombination rate of ionzed hydrogen was either set to zero or doubled , and the number of recombination photon packets adjusted accordingly . otherwise , the runs are the same as the fiducial run .",
    "these models can be thought of as parametrizing the effects of changing the clumping factor of unresolved gas .",
    "@xmath40 * @xmath54 spectrum * a harder spectrum than the @xmath55 spectrum used for the fiducial run was used here .",
    "the total number of ionizing photons integrated to @xmath49 was set to be the same as the fiducial run , so that @xmath56erg / s/@xmath43 .",
    "this run gives a rough indication of the effects of a harder spectrum than that of population ii stars , although it was not chosen to reproduce the spectrum of any particular source .",
    "for example , at the zams , pop iii stars are expected to have a spectrum with @xmath57 , with @xmath58 close to the hydrogen ionizing edge ( tumlinson 2003 ) . for representative composite spectra of agn ( e.g. , telfer 2002 )",
    "a value of @xmath59 is possible .",
    "the effect of the harder spectrum will be to allow the photons to penetrate further .",
    "the `` preheating '' effect of hard photons is not treated here as we do not follow the temperature evolution of the gas explicitly .",
    "@xmath40 * other random phases * as a rough indicator of the effects of cosmic variance , this run has the same parameters as the fiducial run , but uses a different underlying density field realization .",
    "we evolve all the simulations to redshift @xmath60 , irrespective of whether they have achieved full reionization by then .",
    "because we have many different simulation runs with different treatments of recombination and models for the sources , we need to decide at which redshifts to compare our measures of clustering .",
    "the different runs reach @xmath61 mean ionized fraction by mass , @xmath62 at redshifts ranging from @xmath63 , so that comparing them at the same redshift will mean comparing different stages of reionization .",
    "we will therefore concentrate in the paper on snapshots taken at the same mean ionized fractions in the different runs , rather than at the same redshifts .    in figure [ nvsz ]",
    "we show how the mean mass weighted neutral fraction ( linear scale ) and mean mass weighted ionized fraction ( log scale ) vary with redshift for the different runs . as expected , the run without recombinations reionizes first , reaching a @xmath64 ionized fraction by redshift @xmath65 and being @xmath64 neutral at @xmath66 . as reionization proceeds ,",
    "the relationship between mean ionized fraction @xmath62 and redshift is approximately exponential , @xmath67 , ( here @xmath68 is the redshift when the model is fully ionized ) for this and the other models .",
    "this is roughly true for all models , except for the model where only large galaxies ( halo masses @xmath69 ) are sources , and the model with @xmath24 , both of which have a substantially more rapid change in ionization with redshift , @xmath70 .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that galaxies massive enough to be sources only form relatively late in these two models .",
    "the models where the luminosity per dark matter halo atom was varied , fiducial , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 reach the @xmath74 point later by @xmath75 for each halving of the luminosity .",
    "the slope of @xmath76 vs @xmath77 is very similar for @xmath78 for these models but then changes as reionization proceeds .",
    "we note that the @xmath72 model reaches @xmath74 at @xmath79 , similar to the model of zahn ( 2007 ) , which has a similar spectrum and source luminosity ( see  2.3 above . )    more physical insight can be gained by looking at two other quantities as a function of redshift , the number of recombinations per atom and the photon mean free path , which are plotted in figure [ recpath ] .",
    "to compute the former , we divide the cumulative number of recombination photons by the total initial number of hydrogen atoms in the simulation volume .",
    "we plot a symbol on the curves at the point when the ionized fraction by mass reaches @xmath74 and another at @xmath80 ( not all models reach this stage ) .",
    "most of the models have below 0.5 recombination photons per atom by the time they have fully reionized , indicating that recombinations do not play the major role in the process of reionization .",
    "the curves for the different models tend to flatten off slightly for the last half of the reionization process .",
    "one striking feature of these curves is the importance of the amplitude of mass fluctuations , @xmath81 .",
    "as we would expect , the low amplitude model ( @xmath24 ) , having less clumping has a lower recombination rate .",
    "when compared at the point when @xmath74 , this model has experienced @xmath82 times fewer recombinations than the fiducial model . this is greater than the ratio of @xmath83 for the two models ( 1.65 ) , due to nonlinearity of clustering and the greater cosmic time in the low amplitude model to get to this point .",
    "the photon mean free path as a function of redshift is also shown in figure [ recpath ] .",
    "the mean path length between absorptions has been calculated by averaging over the most recent @xmath84 photon packets , a relatively small number . as a result ,",
    "sawtooth features in the curves can be seen , which correspond to the times at which the new density field snapshots were inputted ( every 25 myr ) .",
    "we have tested with more widely spaced outputs ( 50 myr ) that this does not affect the underlying curves .",
    "another artifact of the measurement is the behaviour at large mean free path .",
    "when averaging the path length , we only include photon packets that have not wrapped more than once round the box . as a result ,",
    "when the volume is close to fully ionized , the average is taken over a biased sample , those photons which have run into an absorber in less than a box length .",
    "the mean free path we plot therefore falls .",
    "the overall behaviour of the mfp is as we would expect , with a rapid rise for most models at early times , with a mfp corresponding roughly to the size of the hii regions around sources .",
    "for example at redshift @xmath85 , when the ionized fraction is @xmath86 , the mfp in the fiducial model is @xmath87 . in the @xmath54 spectrum case",
    ", the low cross section of neutral hydrogen for the hard photons means that the mfp starts off nearly an order of magnitude larger , @xmath88 .",
    "the hardest photons will travel much farther than this mean , and there is a low level of ionization ( ionized fraction @xmath89 ) present throughout the whole volume , even at these very early redshifts .    in order to understand how reionization proceeds , it is instructive to look at the relation between neutral fraction and density",
    ". this is plotted for the fiducial run in figure [ scatterfid ] at 4 different stages in the evolution of the model . in each panel",
    ", we also show a histogram of particle density values and neutral fractions as well as a scatter plot of one versus the other .",
    "if we go from panel to panel , we can see that the high density regions are reionized first ( the inside - out scenario also found in iliev 2006 ) .",
    "for example , when @xmath90 , the cloud of partially ionized particles to the right of the panel is centered around @xmath91 , whereas at @xmath92 it is centered around @xmath93 . within this cloud of points",
    ", the higher rate of recombinations in high density regions means that within the partially ionized volume there is a trend for higher neutral fractions at high densities .",
    "this trend is additional to the opposite trend for high density regions to be reach this partially ionized state first .",
    "as the universe comes close to being fully ionized , @xmath94 , particles close to the mean density are the only ones still fully neutral and the particles with the highest densities have neutral fractions @xmath95 .    in the next section",
    ", we examine the morphology of the neutral and ionized regions in order to investigate this in more detail . for now , we can compare the scatter plots of neutral fraction and density in different models .",
    "we do this at @xmath74 in figure [ scatter_m ] .",
    "the absence of a cloud of partially ionized points in the `` no recomb '' simulation is expected , as once particles are ionized , they drop off the bottom of the plot . also as expected , the @xmath54 spectrum simulation and the `` @xmath96 recomb '' run have a greater density of particles in this region than the fiducial model .",
    "just as looking at structure in galaxy redshift surveys ( e.g. , schectman 1996 ) revealed filaments , voids and clusters , the ris is expected to give rise to a complex morphology . in the case of structure in the density field , reproducing the visual characteristics of observational data was one of the drivers in searching for the correct theory of structure formation , and cosmological n - body simulations are expected to give rise to a `` cosmic web '' with the same appearance ( e.g. , bond 1996 ) . deciding how to view the morphology of ris is complicated by the question of whether to plot the neutral fraction , neutral density , ionized density or ionized fraction , each of which can lead to a potentially different impression . also , unlike pure density fluctuations , which evolve relatively slowly , the exact time the ris is plotted as reionization proceeds can yield very different results .",
    "again , we will choose to compare different models at the same value of @xmath62 .    in figure [ slice_05",
    "] , we show a thin ( 1 @xmath19 ) slice through the fiducial simulation volume , at the time when @xmath74 .",
    "we use a two dimensional color scale to show both the density and the neutral fraction of hydrogen , as well as overplotting the positions of the individual sources of radiation , associated with dark matter halos .",
    "it is apparent from the plot that low density regions where there are only a few isolated sources have not yet created noticeable bubbles , but that the highly clustered regions , associated with filaments and proto clusters have appreciable stromgren spheres around them .",
    "iliev ( 2006 ) have measured the size of the bubbles in their simulations by fitting spheres into the ionized regions , finding a median bubble radius of @xmath97 ( see their figure 13 ) at this late stage of reionization .",
    "many other studies , e.g. , shin ( 2007 ) , zahn ( 2007 ) have been carried out on the size of bubbles in simulations . visually , our simulation appears to be broadly consistent with the sizes found by iliev , and we leave to future work detailed statistical characterization of the size and shape of voids in the neutral hydrogen .    for",
    "now , we will comment on the obvious differences apparent between the morphology of ris in the simulation and that which can be seen in the underlying density field .",
    "the ris has a much higher contrast level , with the neutral fraction in hii regions being @xmath98 times less than in the rest of the volume .",
    "the edges of hii regions are consequently much sharper than those of voids in the matter distribution , lending themselves to easier detection by void - finding techniques ( e.g. , colberg 2005 ) .    the matter density field over the redshift range relevant to reioniziation evolves little compared to the neutral density field .",
    "reionization ( say the change from @xmath99 to @xmath100 ) in these models takes place over an change in scale factor @xmath101 of @xmath102 , and as @xmath103 to good approximation at these redshifts , linear growth of matter fluctuations occurs by the same factor . because of this , most of the change in the morphology and structure of neutral density field occurs in the ris .",
    "plotting a slice through the neutral density field at different epochs allows us to see this well . in figure",
    "[ slice_fbs ] , we show this for 3 different models ( fiducial , @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) , at times when @xmath62 varied from 0.1 to 0.9 in steps of 0.2 .",
    "mcquinn ( 2007 ) have shown that the large scale morphology of ionized hydrogen bubbles depends most strongly on @xmath62 and the properties of the ionizing sources , and is relatively less affected by the specific subgrid model used to determine small scale source suppression and clumping factors . in figure [ slice_fbs ] , we can see that models in the same column ( same value of @xmath62 ) are indeed fairly similar .",
    "however , because we use the mass - weighted ionization fraction @xmath62 rather than the volume weighted fraction @xmath106 , our conclusions about the similarity of the morphologies is somewhat different than those of mcquinn ( 2007 ) .",
    "for example , the panel with @xmath74 ( middle panel ) for the fiducial model ( top row ) seems to be most similar to the @xmath107 ( 2nd panel ) for the @xmath104 model ( middle row ) .",
    "this is because in the @xmath104 model , the ionized material is all concentrated in large bubbles , whereas in the fiducial model there are many smaller hii regions around the fainter sources which are hard to see but which nevertheless account for much of the mass in ionized material .",
    "a good way to see that this is the case is to refer to figure [ slice_fbsi ] , which shows the same slices through the same models , but this time plotting the ionized density rather than neutral density .",
    "the hii regions around the fainter sources are clearly seen in the top and bottom rows .",
    "the early hii regions appear sharper and perhaps more spherical when seen directly in terms of their ionized density , rather than as shadows in the neutral hydrogen plot ( figure [ slice_fbs ] ) .",
    "this is understandable because of the fact that the edges of the bubbles and the totality of bubbles that are smaller than the slice thickness ( 1 @xmath19 ) in size will be somewhat obscured in figure [ slice_fbs ] by neutral hydrogen that lies in front or behind the bubble but is still in the slice .    in figures [ slice_fbsi ] and [ slice_fbs ]",
    "we see little difference between the @xmath108 model and the fiducial model , indicating that the absence of the most massive halos does not greatly affect the morphology , as long as we compare at the same value of @xmath62 .",
    "if we look at the panels at the farthest right of these plots , the end stages of reionization ( @xmath109 ) , we can see that the models with small halos allowed do have hi remnants with more ragged edges and more small scale structure apparent in them than the @xmath69 model .",
    "in future work , it would be interesting to investigate the mass function of the disconnected hi remnants present at these times as they may have constraining power ( as well as being likely detectable in 21 cm emission .",
    "the @xmath62 value at which the ionized regions percolate seems likely to depend on the source model also , as for example the @xmath74 panel for the @xmath69 model consists less of disconnected hii regions than the other two panels .",
    "this makes sense , as the ionized material is more clustered , being closer to the more massive haloes .",
    "this @xmath74 epoch is therefore a good one at which to compare the morphology of the other models also . in figure",
    "[ slice_m ] , we show the same thin slice through the neutral density field for the 12 different models .",
    "the panel most different from the others is not suprisingly that for the `` other random phases '' model , for which the slice intersects a fairly spherical bubble ( at the bottom of the plot ) and a large region which has little sign of reionization ( in the middle ) .",
    "comparing this panel to the fiducial model , it might seem as though the latter is closer to the percolation stage , although they both have the same @xmath74 . in the later stages of reionization ,",
    "when the ionized structures are a substantial fraction of the box size , we must naturally be careful in our interpretation of the morphology , due to the effects of cosmic variance and finite volume . as stressed by iliev ( 2006 ) , and others , large boxes are necessary to capture these processes , particularly at the later epochs .",
    "looking systematically at the different panels of figure [ slice_m ] , we can see that in the fiducial , l/2 , l/4 and l/8 models as the luminosity per halo atom is reduced , the visual extent of the structures becomes smaller and smaller . from figure [ recpath ]",
    "we can see that in these models , the number of recombinations becomes progressively higher as we reduce the luminosity , and although one would expect that this would be compensated for in the morphology by the fact that we compare all models at the same @xmath62 , there is in fact still a large difference .",
    "we can therefore state that changing the luminosity of sources at fixed @xmath62 does affect the visual morphology quite strongly . for the l/8 model ,",
    "much of the ionized hydrogen is again hidden from view in the strongly neutral regions , as happened in the comparison of the fiducial and @xmath110 models . from a rough visual comparison of the different columns of figure",
    "[ slice_fbs ] and models l/2-l/8 in figure [ slice_m ] it seems as though scaling the luminosity of sources by a factor of @xmath111 changes the visual morphology of the hi density field in a similar fashion to changing @xmath62 by @xmath112 . of course",
    "this will not hold for the morphology of the ionized regions , and we will investigate this statistically when we look at the correlation function in the next section .",
    "quantitative comparisons of the structure in the various models can be carried out by looking at the autocorrelation function , @xmath113 .",
    "we will focus on @xmath11 measured for the neutral density distribution , although we will briefly examine @xmath11 for the ionized density field .",
    "we note that the fourier transform of @xmath11 , the power spectrum @xmath114 of fluctuations has been studied in reionization models by many authors .",
    "we compute @xmath11 for the gas density directly from the particle positions in the simulation , and for @xmath0 we weight each particle by its neutral fraction : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the number of pairs of particles in a bin centered on @xmath117 , @xmath118 is the expected number for a random distribution , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the neutral fractions of particles in a pair , and @xmath121 is the mean neutral fraction by mass . as with our examination of morphology of the neutral density , we will compute @xmath11 for different simulation outputs chosen by their mass weighted ionized fraction , @xmath62 .      in order to test the range of validity of our @xmath11 results ,",
    "we carry out several resolution and boxsize tests . because the bubble like structures which overlap during the end stages of reionization occupy a large volume",
    ", one would expect that the simulation box size may have a strong effect on our results .",
    "we therefore compute @xmath11 for the neutral gas and the total gas density for two simulations with different box sizes ( we vary the box side length by a factor of 2 ) but the same mass and spatial resolution ( this is kept the same as our fidcucial model ) .",
    "the results are show in figure [ xi_boxsize ] , where the 3 panels show @xmath122 and @xmath123 for at different stages of reionization ( parametrized by @xmath62 ) in the fiducial model .",
    "we can see that the @xmath122 curves are extremely similar over the range @xmath124 for the 3 values of @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , a power law fit to the curves over this range gives virtually identical parameters .",
    "this is a very good thing , because it shows that no non - linear gravitational mode coupling has taken place with large scale density modes of order the box size .",
    "this is one advantage of working at these high redshifts ( @xmath125 for @xmath126 in this case ) , where we can see that even a @xmath26 box is large enough to study gravitational clustering over this range of length scales .",
    "the correlation function of the neutral gas density has a broadly similar behaviour .",
    "the position of the break in the powerlaw form of @xmath11 is due to the finite size of the simulation volume and so we will restrict our analysis of @xmath11 to smaller scales .",
    "interestingly , the panel with results closest to the end of reionization ( @xmath62 ) does not show any greater disagreement for large @xmath117 for @xmath123 than for @xmath122 .",
    "this means that at least over this limited range of scales , our @xmath113 measurements will also be reliable for the neutral density . on the smaller scales ( @xmath127",
    ", there appears to be a rapid drop off in @xmath113 for the neutral density for both boxsizes .",
    "we shall see below when we consider mass and spatial resolution that our results will not be useful below these scales in any case .    for our next test",
    ", we keep the box size fixed at @xmath26 but vary the particle number ( and hence mass resolution ) by a factor of 8 .",
    "we also vary the spatial ( force ) resolution by a factor of 2 .",
    "the coarser mass / spatial resolution is the one we use in our fiducial case ( only with a @xmath18 box ) .",
    "the dark matter halos which we use to place our sources of radiation have the same lower mass cutoff @xmath128 @xmath43 in both runs , which corresponds to 8 times fewer particles in the low resolution case .",
    "the results for @xmath122 and @xmath123 are shown in figure [ xi_res ] , again for different values of @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath122 curves show good agreement on large scales ( the two simulations were run with the same initial phases for the density field ) . on scales",
    "@xmath129 , the two curves diverge , indicating the effects of mass and spatial resolution on the gravitational evolution of the gas density field .",
    "we note that on scales comparable to this the clustering in the gas density will be influenced by cooling and star formation , which we do not include here in any case .",
    "the @xmath123 correlation functions also agree well down to @xmath129 , when they diverge even more sharply .",
    "we notice that as will the boxsize test , the worst disagreement on large scales occurs rather unexpectedly for the early stages of reionization ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "the final simulation parameter which we vary is @xmath32 , the maximum number of simulation particles which can be ionized by a single photon packet .",
    "this parameter ( see section 2.2 for more details ) is inversely proportional to the total number of photon packets used to carry out the monte carlo rt . for larger values of @xmath32 ,",
    "the radiation field will not be as smooth , and there will be more shot noise in the neutral density field .",
    "our fiducial value of @xmath131 , and in figure [ xi_cf ] we show what happens when this is varied from @xmath132 to @xmath133 , with all other simulation parameters the same as our fiducial model .",
    "the @xmath122 curves are almost identical , as might be expected , with the small differences due to the fact that reionization occurs at slightly different times in the different @xmath32 runs .",
    "the curves for @xmath123 are also very similar , and there is no apparent systematic effect even when @xmath32 is made 10 times larger than our fiducial value .",
    "at least as far as the correlation function is concerned , we have therefore converged to stable results with our fiducial number of photon packets .",
    "the tests in this section have therefore revealed that our results for @xmath134 should be reliable over at least the scales @xmath135 .",
    "we will concentrate on this range in our analysis , for example looking at the power law nature of @xmath134 . for looking at larger scales , approaching the scale of bubbles at the time of percolation ,",
    "larger simulation volumes should be run in the future .",
    "we note that because @xmath134 for a @xmath26 volume converged with a larger box on scales below @xmath136 it is probably safe to assume that we can draw information from our fiducial volume ( @xmath18 box ) on scales up to @xmath137 .",
    "we show @xmath11 for the fiducial model in figure [ xifid ] , for values of the ionized fractions @xmath62 ranging from 0.1 to 0.99 , which corresponds to a redshift range of @xmath138 to @xmath139 . before reionization starts , when @xmath140 , @xmath134 and @xmath0 are identical , by definition .",
    "however , once @xmath62 has reached 0.1 , one can see that @xmath0 is somewhat lower than @xmath134 , by a factor of @xmath141 , but has the same shape , a power law : @xmath142 with slope @xmath143 on scales @xmath144 and a gentle break above it ( at a scale dictated by the finite box volume ) . we will explore power law fits to @xmath11 in section 5.4 below . for",
    "now , we explore qualitatively the behaviour of @xmath134 as reionization proceeds .",
    "we note that this behaviour ( a decrease and then an increase in the amplitude of clustering ) has been seen in analytic calculations of the 21 cm brightness correlations ( e.g. , wyithe & morales , 2007 )    as @xmath62 increases , @xmath134 exhibits the usual linear growth , with the amplitude increasing as expected under gravitational instability , and the shape remaning constant .",
    "as can be seen from the solid lines in figure [ xifid ] , this gravitational amplification of structure is very small ( a factor @xmath145 ) over the time of reionization .",
    "@xmath0 on the other hand shows dramatic growth , by a factor 100 or more over the same interval , as we would predict for example by examining the morphology of structure in the hi density field in figure [ slice_fbs ] .",
    "the initial stage of reionization affects primarily the high density regions around sources of radiation .",
    "removing their contribution from the clustering of hi leads to an antibias on all scales in @xmath0 with respect to @xmath134 .",
    "after this , the effect of removing highly clustered neutral regions competes with the amplifying effect of ris , with the latter winning after @xmath146 , raising @xmath0 above @xmath134 at this point .",
    "as the ris grows in scale , the shape of @xmath0 begins to change , with the slope of the powerlaw region becoming flatter , reaching @xmath147 when @xmath80 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath134 can be examined by plotting the bias as a function of scale , defined by @xmath148^{1/2 } \\label{beq}\\ ] ] .",
    "this quantity is plotted in figure [ bfid ] for the fiducial model , where it can be seen that @xmath149 is approximately constant with scale for @xmath150 for @xmath151 , with a value less than 1 for low values of @xmath62 .",
    "after this , @xmath149 takes on a positive power law slope .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath134 are fit by powerlaws , with slopes @xmath152 and @xmath153 , then we expect the slope of a power law fit to @xmath154 , @xmath155 to give @xmath156 .",
    "if we examine @xmath154 for @xmath80 , we find a slope @xmath157 , as expected .",
    "we can see that this slope is reached quite rapidly after @xmath62 reaches @xmath158 and does not appear to evolve much after this .",
    "we shall explore this further below .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath154 in this strongly ionized regime , is not constant with scale , indicating that during the late stages of reionization , 21 cm tomography measurements ( if they were possible on these small scales , which is observationally difficult ) would not result in a straightforward measurement of the underlying gas or dark matter clustering . during the earlier stages , however , the ( anti)bias is linear , although its amplitude may be related to reionization process in a complex way .",
    "if instead we compute @xmath159 , the correlation function of the ionized hydrogren ( e.g. , as plotted in figure [ ionxifid ] ) , we find that the situation is simpler .",
    "this is shown for the fiducial model for different @xmath62 values in figure [ ionxifid ] . at the highest values of @xmath62",
    ", we obviously expect @xmath160 , which has the characteristic power law behaviour for @xmath161 . at earlier times",
    ", @xmath162 has the same slope , but a larger amplitude , indictating that the ionized regions trace a biased subset of the density distribution , around peaks in the density field ( see e.g. , kaiser , 1984 . ) when @xmath90 ( at @xmath138 ) , the value of @xmath163 is @xmath164 , ( compare to @xmath165 for @xmath166 galaxies at the present day , zehavi 2005 ) .",
    "we can see from figure [ ionxifid ] that @xmath167 breaks from a powerlaw at around @xmath168 , which , from looking at figure [ slicefbs ] corresponds approximately to the size of ionized bubbles at this early epoch .",
    "we have seen that @xmath0 in the fiducial model has a similar shape to that which arises under gravitational instability .",
    "we now investigate @xmath0 in the other reionization models in order to see if there is a dependence on the properties of the sources of radiation or the physics of reionization .",
    "we again compute @xmath0 at output times corresponding to different specific values of @xmath62 .",
    "the results for our 12 models are shown in figure [ xi_m ] , along with power - law fits ( described more fully in section 5.4 below ) to the region @xmath169 .",
    "it is apparent that all models display behaviour broadly similar to the fiducial case , with a form reasonably approximate to a power law over @xmath170 decades in scale .",
    "as indicated by our tests above , the break on scales @xmath171 is largely caused by the finite box volume and is expected to be similar in all cases .",
    "all models have a certain level of antibias between @xmath0 and @xmath134 at first , with the most extreme antibias being reached in the `` l/8 '' model .",
    "the `` @xmath172 '' model has only a small level of antibias , indicating that the large bubbles formed rapidly by the very luminous sources quickly modulate the hi field .",
    "the correlation function becomes shallower and its amplitude increases dramatically for all models towards the end of reioniziation .",
    "when @xmath80 , the models all have a very similar amplitude and a shallow power law slope @xmath147 .",
    "it should be noted that model `` l/8 '' and `` l indep m '' do not have outputs for the very end stages of reionization .",
    "the latter has very similar behaviour to the fiducial case , and the former is rather different , as we shall see when we consider the evolution of the power fit parameters .",
    "overall one can see from the panels in figure [ xi_m ] that the ris leads in all models to a strong increase in @xmath0 over the course of reionization . unlike linear growth of fluctuations under gi , the slope the correlations changes , reaching a similar shallow value in all models .",
    "no obvious features with any particular physical are created in @xmath0 in any of our variations of the reionization scenario . despite the relatively wide variety of models employed , the differences in @xmath0 are subtle , and will be explored in @xmath173 space below .",
    "the galaxy - galaxy correlation function has only small deviations from power law behaviour over @xmath174 decades in length scale ( e.g. , peebles , 1980 , and zehavi 2002 ) , despite the undoubted complexities of galaxy formation .",
    "the dark matter correlation function in simulations also exhibits this behaviour ( e.g. , jenkins 1998 , kravtsov 2004 . )",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to expect that this type of scale invariance might also be created by ris .",
    "we have seen from figure [ xi_m ] that this is indeed the case . in this subsection",
    "we examine the power law behaviour of @xmath0 more quantitatively .",
    "we fit power laws to the region @xmath169 , based on the resolution and boxsize tests of section 5.1 .",
    "the power - law fits were carried out assuming poisson errors on the @xmath0 points , so that the error is @xmath175 , where @xmath116 is the number of pairs of particles in a bin .",
    "we have tried changing @xmath116 to include only pairs of particles above a threshold neutral fraction ( e.g. , @xmath176 ) , but this has a negible effect on the fit parameters .",
    "also , changing the fitting region to @xmath177 does not change any of our conclusions below .    in the top 2 panels of figure [ fitxi ]",
    ", we show the dependence of the power law fit parameters @xmath163 and @xmath178 on @xmath62 for our different models .",
    "looking at @xmath163 first , we can see that there is a strong dependence on @xmath62 .",
    "the models all follow a trend roughly equivalent ( within a factor of 2 in @xmath163 for all but one model ) to @xmath179 , with the @xmath180 model being the most extreme outlier .",
    "the fact that the lines for nearly all the different models are clustered together so tightly is rather surprising , and appears to be an indication that @xmath62 plays a dominant role setting @xmath163 . at least in this fashion",
    ", the neutral fraction governs the structure in the neutral hydrgogen density field .",
    "the visual morphology of different models with the same @xmath62 values ( e.g. , figure [ slice_m ] ) did appear to be noticeably different , rather more than one would expect give the tight locus of @xmath181 curves .",
    "given the visual impression of the hi slices , however , it is understandable that the model with perhaps the greatest difference to the others ( the @xmath182 model ) is also discrepant in terms of @xmath163 . for any value of @xmath62 , this model has a larger @xmath163 than the others .",
    "the @xmath163 differences between models are small , but measurable , as are the purely gravitational instability based differences ( note that the models reach different values of @xmath62 at different redshifts , so that the underlying @xmath183 curves will be different . )",
    "we do find a wider variation in the values of the slope of @xmath1 , for fixed values of @xmath62 .",
    "this can be seen from the middle panel of figure [ fitxi ] , where for example @xmath178 varies from 1.6 to 0.6 when @xmath74 .",
    "the fiducial model has @xmath184 when @xmath74 .",
    "if we look horizontally to find out at what @xmath62 value the other models have the same slope , we find a range from @xmath185 ( for the l/4 model ) to @xmath186 ( for the @xmath180 model ) .",
    "all curves ( except for the l/8 model which does not get more than half ionized ) do follow the same pattern , with the slope getting asymptotically flatter as reionization proceeds , all ending up with @xmath147 .",
    "the rapidity with which this asymptotic value is reached does vary with the different models , with the @xmath180 model doing this most quickly , as the large - scale modulation effects of the bright sources tilt the correlation function upwards on large scales .",
    "the slope of @xmath1 stays approximately constant as @xmath163 increases rapidly during the end stages of reionization , as can be seen clearly from the bottom panel of figure [ fitxi ] , where @xmath173 curves are plotted . in the region to the left of the plot , clustering of hi in all models is dominated by the clustering in the underlying density field .",
    "the ris then takes over , and again all models follow a rather similar locus of @xmath1 parameters .",
    "we have seen above that the variation between the @xmath173 lines is mostly due to the variation of @xmath178 with @xmath62 in the different models .",
    "overall , the change in slope for the different models can be qualitively explained by the different length scales of the ris features that occur in each , even at the same stages of reionization ( @xmath62 values ) .",
    "there is a competition between small and large scale features that sets the slope of the correlation function .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath163 is more puzzling , and we shall return to these questions in section 6.2      we have seen in previous sections that once reionization is visually progressing , the amplitude of fluctuations in the hi field grows extremely rapidly .",
    "it is interesting to compare this quantitatively to the growth expected of perturbations under gravitational instability . in the latter case",
    ", the amplitude of linear density perturbations will grow at the same rate independent of scale , so that @xmath134 will retain the same shape , but increase in amplitude by an overall factor @xmath187^{2}$ ] which can be computed from first order perturbation theory ( e.g. , peebles 1980 ) . at the high redshifts relevant here ( @xmath188 )",

    "we have seen that @xmath163 for the matter correlation function is between 0.1 and 0.5 @xmath19 for the models over the range of redshifts when reionization occurs , so that linear theory should be accurate over most of the range of scales indicated by our resolution and boxsize tests ( section 5.1 ) .",
    "we can also see from figure [ xi_m ] that @xmath134 does keep the same shape , and increases in amplitude slowly , as expected .",
    "this can also be inferred from figure [ gfid ] , where we plot the square root of the ratio of the correlation function @xmath134 at redshift @xmath77 to that at redshift @xmath190 , as a function of @xmath77 .",
    "this is proportional to the growth factor of pertubations between redshifts .",
    "there are three lines on the plot , corresponding to @xmath191 and @xmath192 .",
    "the lines are close together , indicating that the shape of @xmath134 does not change dramatically .    in figure [ gfid ]",
    ", we plot the same quantity for @xmath0 , for the same @xmath117 values , for the fiducial model of reionization . in this case , we see both that growth of pertubations is much more rapid , due to the ris , than the linear density growth .",
    "we draw a smooth curve corresponding to @xmath193 alongside the simulation growth factor for @xmath194 in order to show roughly how extreme the growth in fluctuations as a function of redshift is during the epoch of reionization . the growth is faster than exponential over the short interval between @xmath195 and @xmath196 , it is roughly an exponential function of a power law .",
    "we also see that the different scales exhibit different growth rates , with the large - scale fluctuations changing most rapidly . on @xmath197 scales ,",
    "the fluctuations are first suppressed , with the square root of @xmath0 decreasing by a factor @xmath198 , before rapidly increasing after @xmath199 .",
    "this stronger behaviour relative to the smaller scales results in the flattening of the correlation function .",
    "the roughly parallel nature of the curves after @xmath200 indicates that at the late stages of reionization the flatter power law form of @xmath0 has been reached , and the amplitude grows similarily on all scales .    if we now consider the growth of perturbations in the different models , a better way to compare them is to look at the growth as a function of @xmath62 . in figure",
    "[ gm ] we show this for the @xmath201 scale . as the models become more ionized , from left to right , the amplitude of fluctuations first dips and then rises steeply . the model which dips the least on these scales is the @xmath69 model , as we expect from looking at figure [ xi_m ] .",
    "the main growth phase of fluctuations starts between @xmath90 @xmath202 , depending on the model , with an exponential relationship between @xmath203 and @xmath62 .",
    "the curves appear to converge towards the end of reionization , so that all models exhibit roughly the same amount of growth , within @xmath204 from the start of reionization until @xmath94 .",
    "the models which started off with less growth in @xmath1 therefore have steeper dependence on @xmath62 .",
    "we find that @xmath205 approximately holds over the range @xmath206 for the fiducial model .",

    "if we look at the growth factor from the point of view of the parameters varied in each model , we can see that decreasing the luminosity ( from the fiducial model through @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) monotonically changes how abrupt the growth of hi fluctuations is during the bulk of the reionization process .",
    "the model with least luminous sources ( @xmath73 ) exhibits fastest growth with respect to @xmath210 , although of course with respect to @xmath77 , this is not necessarily the case .",
    "we have examined the growth factor vs @xmath77 for the different models ( not plotted ) and find that the growth of fluctuations for all models has ( at least for the @xmath211 scale ) a form roughly consistent wit the @xmath193 curve drawn on figure [ gfid ] . to zeroth order , the growth of hi fluctuations as a function of @xmath77 does not seem to be dependent on the source physics .      we have seen that a simple power law fit to the hi correlation function works well on scales for which the simulation has sufficient boxsize and spatial resolution . as reionization proceeds ,",
    "the power law becomes shallower , moving away from the slope of the underlying matter correlation function . while this paper s focus is on numerical modelling and phenomenology of hi clustering rather than analytic modelling ,",

    "@xmath219 is negative , an unphysical result which occurs because of the correlation between sources and @xmath221 .",
    "as reionization proceeds , @xmath219 becomes dramatically larger in amplitude , and the right hand cut off moves to larger scales .",
    "the correlation function is close to flat on smaller scales than the break .",
    "we can interpret this behaviour approximately in the context of the babul and white model fit , which is also shown in figure [ babul1 ] .",
    "we have fit the curves in the same manner as was carried out for the power law fits in section 5.4 ( assuming poisson errors ) .",
    "it is evident that the simple model can reproduce the rough shape of @xmath219 , with agreement becoming best towards the end stages of reionization .",
    "it is the modulation of the density correlation function by this form for the ris @xmath222 results in the flattening of @xmath0",
    ".    it would be interesting if the best fit value of @xmath218 for a given @xmath219 could be used as a measure of the bubble size .",
    "there are two problems with this , however .",
    "the first is that in the early stages of reionization when bubbles are better defined , they are strongly correlated with sources , so that the fit does nt work .",
    "the second problem is that at late times , the simulation box size we have used becomes comparable to the bubble size and the results will presumably not be very reliable .",
    "there is a range of reionization stages for which this might be useful though . for the fits in figure [ babul1 ]",
    "the @xmath218 values did vary monotonically with @xmath210 , with @xmath223 for @xmath202 , @xmath224 for @xmath74 and @xmath225 for @xmath92 . above @xmath126 , @xmath218 saturated at a value of @xmath226 , possibly indicating the limitations of finite boxsize .",
    "the other parameter , the filling factor @xmath217 can also be examined , and could also be a useful diagnostic . in this case",
    "the value steadily increases , with @xmath227 for @xmath228 .",
    "we note from the definition of @xmath217 above that it is a nominal filling factor , and as a result @xmath217 will become greated than unity as bubbles overlap in the late stages of reionization .",
    "the difference between @xmath219 for the different models ( all with @xmath229 ) is shown in figure [ babul2 ] .",
    "we can see that the peak amplitude of the curves varies by a factor of @xmath230 between models , but that they all display the same shallow curves behaviour with a cutoff .",
    "as we would expect , the model with the largest obvious bubbles in figure [ slice_m ] , @xmath231 has the largest amplitude and largest cutoff scale .",
    "a few of the models ( for example l/4 and l/8 ) have a negative @xmath219 and are not plotted . for clarity , we do not show the model fits , but we note that the @xmath232 has the largest value of @xmath217 , 0.27 , and the l/2 model has the smallest value , 0.06 . these values for the bubble filling factor appear by eye to be at least indicative of the trends seen in figure [ slice_m ] .",
    "in this paper we have explored the radiation - induced structures ( ris ) produced during the epoch of reionization and compared them to the results of gravitational instability .",
    "our conclusions can be summarized as follows : + ( 1 ) for most of the models we have tested , we find that the mean ionized fraction of hydrogen increases exponentially , @xmath67 ( where @xmath68 is the redshift of full ionization ) as reionization proceeds . for models adjusted to have emitted the same number of source ionizing photons by @xmath49 ,",
    "there is still quite a wide spread in the redshift of reionization , with models reaching @xmath74 from @xmath233 to @xmath234 ( the last one to reionize is the low @xmath81 model . ) + ( 2 ) at a fixed @xmath62 , the morphology of the ris is most strongly affected by the lower cutoff in source luminosity , which changes the size of bubbles .",
    "the mass to light ratio of sources also has a substantial effect , but the recombination rate and the amplitude of mass fluctuations , @xmath235 only minimally change the appearance of the hi density field .",
    "+ ( 3 ) the hi correlation function , @xmath1 exhibits a generic behaviour for all models tested .",
    "@xmath1 initially becomes linearly antibiased with respect to the matter @xmath183 , as the high density hi around sources is ionized .",
    "the linear bias factor reaches a minimum of @xmath236 when @xmath237 .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath1 then increases rapidly , and @xmath1 keeps a scale invariant shape , but the power law index flattens to an asymptotic value of @xmath238 .",
    "+ ( 4 ) we find that @xmath163 , the correlation length of @xmath1 has the essentially the same functional relationship with @xmath62 in all but one of the models we have tested . how the power - law index @xmath178 varies with @xmath62 on the other hand depends much more widely on the different source and physics prescriptions adopted .",
    "+ ( 5 ) the growth factor of hi perturbations is seen to change much more rapidly than that of gravitionally evolving matter perturbations over a redshift range @xmath6 during which the bulk of reionization occurs .",
    "we find pertubations on a scale of @xmath211 to be evolving @xmath239 compared to @xmath240 for gravitational growth .",
    "this is valid for all models tested , so that the source physics does not appear to affect relation .",
    "+ ( 6 ) during the late stages of reionization , the shape evolution of @xmath1 can be approximately reproduced by a simple model due to babul & white ( 1991 ) in which ionizing sources are uncorrelated with the density field and produce spherical bubbles .",
    "fitting the parameters of this model to @xmath1 therefore form a method for inferring simple morphological characteristics from measurements of @xmath1 .",
    "+      in this paper , we have largely avoided discussing directly observational probes of the ris and the reionization epoch .",
    "this said , many of our findings can be related closely to the possible results of a survey of 21 cm brightness , as a function of angular position and wavelength .",
    "we have concentrated mainly on the correlation function of the hi , and so in the most likely scenario in which there have been enough early x - ray sources to heat up the primordial gas just before reionization occurs , its temperature is higher than the cmb and we are in the emission regime . in this case , the 21 cm brightness temperature is independent of the spin temperature .",
    "the brightness temperature @xmath241 , where @xmath242 is the overdensity of hydrogen and @xmath243 the neutral fraction ( see e.g. , madau 1997 , di matteo 2004 , barkana 2007 . )    looking at the autocorrelation function of the hi , the power law behaviour we see is striking . for structure growing through gravitational instablity ,",
    "the initial fluctuations are scale - invariant over a large range and they evolve in a scale free manner ( peebles 1974 , davis & peebles 1977 . ) in the case of ris , the onset of significant clustering is extremely rapid , and it might be expected that this would lead to features in the correlation function related to for example the stromgren radius of sources dominant at that time . on the other hand , cosmic variance would lead to a substantial scatter in the scale length of features from place to place .",
    "our fiducial simulation volume , at @xmath244 comoving @xmath19 side length also limits our ability to capture the late stages of reionization .",
    "wyithe and loeb ( 2004 ) have predicted a comoving radius of bubbles @xmath245 at the end of the overlap stage .",
    "we have seen in  5.6 that the simple babul and white model fit does capture the shape of @xmath11 reasonably well even though there is a distinct bubble scale in the model .",
    "scale invariance therefore appears relatively easy to achieve and detection of departures from it probably requires a wide range of scales to be available .",
    "furlanetto ( 2006 ) have used the analytic model of furlanetto ( 2004 ) to describe how the hii bubble size is related to both the bias of galaxies and the underlying matter power spectrum .",
    "the success of such analytic models in comparisons to simulations ( e.g. , zahn 2007 ) has opened up the way for their use in analyzing future 21 cm observations . our related work , attempting to directly simulate a relatively wide range of models has found that the autocorrelation function of 21 cm emission can be used to infer the broad signatures of ris compared to gravitational structure ( e.g. , non - monotonic growth , flatter asymptotic slope @xmath238 ) which will help in analysis of the first observations .    among the other analytic models which have been developed",
    ", the pertubation theory approach of zhang ( 2007 ) is different from many in that it does not make a step function bubble approximation to the hi distribution . as our simulation approach includes recombinations and the contribution of residual hi in the ionized regions , future comparisons will be beneficial . for example , zhang ( 2007 ) compute the rapid rise in the bias of hi clustering as a function of redshift , finding some qualitatively similar results to ours , although they find a scale - independent bias on large scales .",
    "one aspect which we have not covered is the effect of redshift distortions on the ris .",
    "we expect the autocorrelation function to be affected by the usual line of sight amplification ( kaiser 1987 ) on large scales , and small scale suppression from the velocity dispersion ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) on small scales .",
    "the latter effect in particular is likely to be strongly modified by the fact that most of the hi around bright sources and hence in dense regions is ionized early on .",
    "these effects will likely be important in the use of 21 cm emission maps to carry out tests of cosmic geometry ( see e.g. , nusser 2005 . )",
    "it would be simple enough in future work to look at the simulations in redshift space , such as would be seen with observational data .    in carrying out our numerical experiments , we have simulated a range of models , which we expect to have many of the features likely in most scenarios for the reionization of the universe .",
    "it was not possible to be completely general , however , and it is certainly possible to imagine other interesting models and tests of the physics that could be included .",
    "for example , mcquinn ( 2007 ) ran as one of their many models one in which all cells in the simulation were set to the mean density .",
    "this had the effect of changing the amount of structure in the ionization fronts , and of course drastically reducing the recombination rate .",
    "with our postprocessing rt carried out on the hydrogen distribution only , by keeping track of the ionization state but not predicting the temperature we necessarily simplified much of the physics involved in reionization .",
    "as our intention was to capture the broad differences between ris and gravitational structure , we do not regard this as important .",
    "however in future work extending our simulation approach so that it is directly relevant to upcoming observational data , we plan to capture more detail .",
    "for example , the code sphray ( altay 20007 ) which represents an extension of the present method includes different ionized species and explicit temperature evolution .",
    "other work such as ciardi ( 2006 ) and mcquinn ( 2007 ) specifically include the effect of minihalos , sources below the resolution scale of the simulation .",
    "the latter group finds that they have a strong effect on the growth of large bubbles in the late stages of reionization . in the present work",
    ", we have seen from our resolution studies that the autocorrelation function at least is not sensitive to increases in mass resolution and small scale structure , at least to the accuracy and range of models that we have considered . in principle",
    ", the high spatial resolution of our gridless ray tracing approach could allow the effects of lyman - limit systems to be modelled , which become dominant in limiting the photon mean free path when the universe is mostly ionized ( e.g. , miralda - escud 2000 . )    future work on realistic models should also include radiative cooling in the formation of sources and modelling of specific sources and spectra .",
    "quasars and miniquasars have been investigated by including the formation and growth of black holes together with a model for feedback directly into cosmological sph simulations ( di matteo 2007 , sijacki 2007 , pelupessy 2007 ) .",
    "using such models as sources in rt calculations would enable us to investigate how the ris caused by harder sources is different to softer sources , in ways which are not constrained by the simple association of source and halo mass as has been carried out here .",
