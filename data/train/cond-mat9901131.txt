    "low dimensionality , geometrical constraints and interactions between classically diffusing particles are expected to modify transport coefficients and/or the nature of the asymptotic regimes . as a trivial example , a brownian particle subjected to a purely reflecting wall has a anomalous drift , its average position increasing as @xmath4 , ( which corresponds to a vanishing velocity ) whereas the centered second moment has a normal diffusive spreading with a lowered diffusion constant as compared to the diffusion without barrier . in the case of two particles with a contact repulsion ,",
    "each of them plays for the other the role of a _ fluctuating _ boundary condition which affects both the transport coefficients linked to the average position and the mean square deviation .",
    "the aim of this letter is to discuss such questions in the general case of @xmath0 mutually interacting particles with a hard - core interaction .",
    "classical diffusion with interactions does not seem to have drawn so much attention .",
    "a notable exception is the so - called `` tracer problem '' defined as the diffusion of a tagged particle in an infinite sea of other diffusing particles .",
    "the one - dimensional model was first solved by harris @xcite and discussed in subsequent papers @xcite .",
    "the main result is that the mean square dispersion of the position , @xmath5 , displays a subdiffusive behaviour , which originates from the fact that the motion of the tagged particle is , anywhere and at any time , hindered by all surrounding particles . in one dimension harris",
    "found that @xmath5 grows as @xmath4 at large times ; this implies that the typical distance travelled by the tracer at time @xmath6 goes like @xmath7 instead of @xmath4 in the free case .",
    "more recently , derrida et al .",
    "@xcite found several exact results for the asymmetric simple exclusion process @xcite ; recent bibliography and other results on such subject can be found in mallick s thesis @xcite .",
    "the problem here considered is frankly different , although it belongs to the so - called single - file diffusion problem encountered in many fields ( one - dimensional hopping conductivity @xcite , ion transport in biological membranes @xcite , channelling in zeolithes @xcite ) . at some initial time",
    ", a compact cluster of @xmath0 pointlike particles is launched at the origin of a one - dimensional space ; each of them undergoes ordinary brownian motion but has a contact repulsive interaction with its neighbours . as a consequence , the particles located at the egde of the cluster can move freely on one side and are subjected to a fluctuating boundary condition on the other , whereas the particles inside the cluster are subjected to such boundary conditions on either side .",
    "the questions to be solved are to find the ( anomalous ) drift of one particle and its diffusion constant as a function of the position within the cluster and of the number of @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , two - particle correlations are worthy to be analyzed , as well as the asymptotic one - body probability distributions .",
    "at the initial time , the @xmath0 particles are assumed to form a compact cluster located at the origin @xmath8 , each of them having the same diffusion constant @xmath9 as all the others . due to the contact repulsion",
    ", two particles can never cross each other , so that order in space is preserved at any time ; this means that the @xmath0 coordinates @xmath10 can be labelled so that : @xmath11 the solution of the diffusion equation for such an initial condition is the following : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the heaviside unit step function ( @xmath14 if @xmath15 , @xmath16 otherwise ) . in a recent and important paper @xcite ,",
    "the general formal solution of the same problem with an arbitrary initial condition was given , using the reflection principle .",
    "> from eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) , one readily gets the reduced one - particle density for the @xmath17 particle of the cluster : @xmath18^{n-1 } \\left[1-\\phi\\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4dt}}\\right)\\right]^{n - n } \\frac { \\e^{-x^{2}/(4dt)}}{\\sqrt{4\\pi dt } } \\enspace.\\label{pnn}\\ ] ] in the last equation , @xmath19 denotes the probability integral @xcite , satisfying @xmath20 .",
    "the two factors @xmath21 represent the steric effects on the @xmath22 particle due to the other ones . knowing @xmath23 , it is in principle possible to compute the first few moments giving the average position and the mean square dispersion for anyone of the particles . as a first result",
    ", one immediately observes that any moment of the coordinate has a quite simple variation in time , at any time , not only in the final stage of the motion . indeed , using eq .",
    "( [ pnn ] ) , it is readily seen that the the @xmath24 moment @xmath25 increases at any time as @xmath26 since @xmath27 is the only lengthscale of the problem . as a consequence , @xmath28 , the average coordinate of the @xmath29 particle @xmath30 increases as @xmath4  except for instance for the central particle of the cluster when @xmath0 is odd  , whereas the mean square displacement @xmath31 increases as @xmath6 .",
    "the drift , due to left - right symmetry breaking , is thus always anomalous and the diffusion is always normal . as a consequence , one can define , @xmath32 and @xmath0 , the following transport coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 : @xmath35 @xmath36 it remains to find the functions @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which incorporate the dependence of the transport coefficients upon the number of particles . for @xmath39 ,",
    "one readily finds : @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the case of a non - fluctuating ( fixed ) perfectly reflecting barrier , one has : @xmath42 thus , for a cluster of two particles , each of them acting for the other as a fluctuating barrier , the drift is slowered and the diffusion is enhanced as compared to a fixed barrier .",
    "these facts are easily understood on physical grounds .",
    "unfortunately , it does not seem possible to write the exact expressions of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in a closed , tractable form , starting from eq .",
    "( [ pnn ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "since it is worthy to analyze the case of a large number @xmath43 and since the factors involving the @xmath19 s functions have rather sharp derivatives , especially when @xmath0 is large , it is expected that a gaussian approximation can indeed produce the correct large-@xmath0 variation of the @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "let us first consider one of the two particles located at one extremity of the cluster , the right one for instance . from eq .",
    "( [ pnn ] ) , the one - body density can be written as ( @xmath44 ) : @xmath45^{n } \\enspace.\\label{pnn}\\ ] ] this expression naturally has the form encountered in the statistics of extreme values @xcite . when @xmath43 , this is a very sharp function with a maximum @xmath46 defined by : @xmath47 making now a gaussian approximation for @xmath48 , one readily finds , up to logarithmic corrections : @xmath49 thus , for large @xmath0 , the coefficient for the anomalous drift has a logarithmic increase with respect to the number @xmath0 of particles of the cluster : @xmath50 the fact that @xmath51 increases with @xmath0 is evident on physical grounds ( all the  inside \" particles are pushing on those which are at the edges ) , but this increase is extremely slow .",
    "in addition , the same approximation yields : @xmath52 so that : @xmath53 although the diffusion is normal , the diffusion constant decreases and tends toward @xmath16 for infinite @xmath0 . in a pictorial way , the more there are particles pushing on its back , the less quickly spreads any one of the edge particles on either side of its average position , which drifts proportionnally to @xmath4 .",
    "note that , from eqs .",
    "( [ x1ngauss ] ) and ( [ deltax2ngauss ] ) , the relative fluctuations for the edge particles behave as @xmath2 ; this extremely slow decrease of fluctuations , as compared to @xmath54 in ordinary cases , implies that convergence toward a large - number law , if any , is quite poor .",
    "the correctness of the gaussian approximation for the two first moments was checked by numerically computing the exact average position and exact mean square displacement and by looking at @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath56\\ln\\frac{n}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}}$ ] .",
    "1 displays the rather rapid convergence of such quantities toward constants at large @xmath0 , confirming the validity of the gaussian approximation at least for the two first moments .",
    "obviously , things go quite differently for the particle located at the center of the cluster , assuming @xmath0 to be an odd number for simplicity .",
    "first , it does not move in the mean .",
    "second , it must have a rather small diffusion constant as compared to the edge particles , since it is strongly inhibited by its numerous erratic partners on either side of it . indeed , the gaussian approximation yields : @xmath57 this provides the large-@xmath0 dependence of the diffusion constant for the central particle : @xmath58 entailing that the fluctuations are now of the order of @xmath59 .",
    "thus , in any case , the diffusion is normal , as contrasted to the harris case for which @xmath60 .",
    "yet , note that in the @xmath61 limit , both @xmath62 and @xmath63 vanish , which indicates a lowering of the dynamical exponent .",
    "the vanishing in all cases of the diffusion constants in the @xmath0-infinite limit signals the onset of a subdiffusive regime in the finite concentration situation . considering the middle particle , which is surrounded by infinitely many other , this is in conformity with harris result .",
    "for the two edge particles , the marginal logarithmic decrease of @xmath62 comes from the fact that the former still face a free semi - infinite space to wander in .",
    "note that the scaling upon @xmath0 as described by eqs .",
    "( [ vngauss ] ) and ( [ dngauss ] ) are the same as those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite ; nevertheless , the asymptotic distribution law is not of the gumbel type ( see below ) .",
    "statistical correlations inside the cluster are also worthy to analyze . as an example , let us consider the correlations between the two edge particles . for the latter , the two - body probability density is easily found from eq .",
    "( [ pn ] ) as the following : @xmath64^{n-2}\\e^{-(u_{1}^{2}+u_{n}^{2})}\\,y(u_{n}-u _ { 1 } ) \\enspace.\\label{prl2}\\ ] ] two - body correlations are most simply measured by @xmath65 ; making again a gaussian approximation for the two - body density , this correlator has the following approximate expression : @xmath66 due to scaling in space , the normalized ratio @xmath67 is a constant in time .",
    "this constant turns out to be an _ increasing _ function of the number @xmath0 of particles ; from eqs .",
    "( [ x1ngauss ] ) and ( [ deltax2ngauss ] ) , one finds : @xmath68^{2}\\enspace.\\label{crlnnorm}\\ ] ] thus , increasing the number of inner particles _ enhances _ , although quite slowly , the correlations between the two edge particles .",
    "far from inducing some kind of screening effect , repeated numerous collisions from inner particles enhance the statistical correlations between the edge particles . in a pictorial way",
    ", it can be said that the former act as  virtual bosons \" by going from one to the other edge particles ; the more they are , stronger is the effective ( statistical ) coupling .",
    "interestingly enough , it is also posible to obtain the asymptotic form of the one - body distribution given by eq .",
    "( [ pnn ] ) . for the right particle ( @xmath69 ) , starting from eq .",
    "( [ pnn ] ) , one easily finds , with still @xmath70 : @xmath71 \\enspace.\\label{p1nas}\\ ] ]    the maximum occurs for @xmath72 and the front is clearly asymmetric around @xmath46  although the gaussian approximation , as shown above , well accounts for the large-@xmath0 dependence of the two first moments ( expectation value and fluctuations ) .",
    "this asymmetry represents the pressure exerted by the inner particles on the edge ones . for the left particle ,",
    "one simply has @xmath73 .",
    "[ compppas ] shows that the large-@xmath0 expression , eq .",
    "( [ p1nas ] ) , reproduces quite well the exact @xmath74 even for a moderately large value of @xmath0 . from eq .",
    "( [ p1nas ] ) , it is seen that @xmath75 is not exactly a gumbel distribution ; on the other hand , the rescaled variable @xmath76 has , up to logarithmic corrections , the same dependence upon @xmath0 as a true gumbel variable as far as the two first moments are concerned .    as constrasted , starting again from eq .",
