    "many low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) consist of a neutron star accreting from a low mass companion star ( @xmath0 1 @xmath1 ) . accreting matter may spin up the neutron star ( ns ) ; therefore , one of the possible endpoints of the evolution of a low - mass x - ray binary is expected to be a millisecond pulsar , i.e. a rapidly spinning ns with a rather weak , @xmath2 gauss , surface magnetic field .",
    "although evidence for rapidly spinning ns in lmxbs was inferred from the burst oscillations that were seen during type i x - ray bursts in several systems ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , the detection of millisecond pulsations in persistent emission remained elusive for many years until the discovery of the first accreting millisecond pulsar by @xcite .",
    "since that time , a total of seven accreting msps have been detected .",
    "all of the accreting msps are x - ray transients ; they spend most of the time in a quiescent phase , with x - ray luminosities of order of @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "they sometimes show x - ray outbursts reaching x - ray luminosities of @xmath5 erg s@xmath4 , during which coherent pulsations are observed with frequencies in the range between 180 and 435 hz ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "this frequency is interpreted as the ns rotation frequency given by a hot spot ( or spots ) in an atmospheric layer of the rotating ns @xcite .",
    "msps represent a new class of objects connecting accretion powered x - ray pulsars with rotation powered millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "msp energy spectra are successfully fitted by a two - component model consisting of a multicolor blackbody soft x - ray emission and a comptonized spectrum for the hard x - ray emission .",

    "this allowed us to study the pulsed fraction up to this high energy .",
    "we confirmed for the first time the increase of the pulsed fraction with energy in an accretion powered msp , explained by the action of the doppler effect on the exponentially cutoff comptonization spectrum from the hot spot or from a componization model where we account the pulsed fraction to be produced in a corona cloud .",
    "we also measured soft time lags with a complex energy dependence . similarly to sax j1808.4 - 3658 and xte  j1751 - 350 , the time lags increase rapidly with energy until  10 kev .",
    "however , in igr  j00291 + 5934 , the time lags first increase and then decrease slightly , saturating above 15 kev , and possibly reaching zero around 50 kev .",
    "this is a intriguing result , and if confirmed or observed in another object could be a serious challenge to any time - lag model .",
    "additionally , with rxte we measured an increase of the ns spin period during accretion for the first time .",
    "this provided a strong confirmation of the theory of recycled pulsars in which the old neutron stars in lmxbs become millisecond radio pulsars through spin - up by transfer of angular momentum by the accreting material @xcite .",
    "analysis of the recent too observation of hete  j1900.1 - 2455 is also discussed .",
    "we observe in this object type i x - ray bursts showing , at high energy , evidence of photospheric radius expansion in the burst profile . using jem - x / isgri data at high energy , and assuming the bolometric burst peak luminosity during photospheric radius expansion to be saturated at the eddington limit",

    "a very interesting result is that the pulsations at the spin frequency are not always observed in this source .",
    "for the integral observed msp sources the high energy spectrum could be described with a photon index of @xmath6 1.82.0 and a cut - off energy at @xmath6 80100 kev .",

    "the hard emission is likely to be produced by thermal comptonization in the hot accretion shock on the ns surface with the seed photons coming from the stellar surface .",
    "the spectra are best fitted with the thermal comptonization model compps in the slab geometry @xcite .",
    "the main model parameters are the thomson optical depth @xmath7 across the slab , the electron temperature @xmath8 , the soft seed photon temperature @xmath9 , and the inclination angle @xmath10 between the slab normal and the line of sight .",

    "the hard spectral component contributes most of the observed flux ( 7080 per cent ) , even though a soft component ( disk black body ) is required by the data .",

    "the hot spot at the surface with temperature @xmath6 0.81.5 kev gives rise to the seed photons for comptonization in the hot plasma .",
    "since the hard x - ray emission is pulsed ( see sec .",

    "was required by the fit , very likely because the bulk of its emission occurs below 3 kev , outside the covered energy range .",
    "however , the apparent area of the seed photons , which turns out to be @xmath13 km@xmath14 , could correspond to a hot spot radius of @xmath15 km during the integral too outburst phase .",
    "only s spectrum differs from other msp in requiring thermal soft x - ray emission with nearly double the temperature .",
    "we could not distinguish between the multi - temperature blackbody and single blackbody models , as both gave comparable parameters and @xmath16 .",
    "however , for a distance of 5 kpc , the disk blackbody gives an inner disk radius , @xmath17 km , smaller than the expected ns radius .",
    "for the blackbody emission , the fit implies the apparent area of the emission region @xmath18 km@xmath14 , which could be consistent with the heated ns surface around the accretion shock @xcite . from our spectral fits",
    "we infer that this emission is not likely produced in a multi - temperature accretion disk but more likely arises from thermal emission at the ns surface .",
    "we note that the product @xmath19 is very close in the three sources . the spectral shape and the product @xmath19 are very stable during the outburst as is observed in other sources too ( e.g. * ?",
    "the constancy of the spectral slopes during the outbursts and their extreme similarity in different msps can be used as an argument that the emission region geometry does not depend on the accretion rate . if the energy dissipation takes place in a hot shock , while the cooling of the electrons ( that emit x/@xmath20-rays via thermal comptonization ) is determined by the reprocessing of the hard x - ray radiation at the neutron star surface ( so called two - phase model , the spectral slope is determined by the energy balance in the hot phase and is a function of the geometry . at constant geometry ( e.g. slab ) , the temperature depends on the optical depth , but @xmath21 is approximately constant .",

    "this is the first time such behaviour has been measured for any of the accretion - powered msps .",
    "since msps are rapidly rotating , a first interpretation is given through a doppler boosting model which affects the fast rotating spot emitting pattern as a black body .",
    "when the spot moves towards the observer , the emission increases , while for a spot moving away , the flux drops .",
    "the doppler factor reaches the maximum a quarter of a period before the peak of the projected area , shifting the emission peak towards an earlier phase . the observed flux due to the doppler effect varies as the doppler factor to the power @xmath59 @xcite , where the photon index @xmath60 could be a function of energy .",

    "first , this phase / time lag effect was interpreted as a result of the photon delay due to downscattering of hard x - ray photons in the relatively cold plasma of the disk or ns surface @xcite .",

    "recently , @xcite derived a comptonization model for the observed properties of the energy dependent soft / hard time lags .",

    "<S> i review the properties of three x - ray accreting millisecond pulsars observed with integral . out of seven recently discovered accretion - powered pulsars ( one discovered by integral ) , three were observed with the integral satellite up to 300 kev . </S>",
    "<S> detailed timing and spectral results will be presented , including data obtained during the most recent outburst of the pulsar hete j1900.1 - 2455 . </S>",
    "<S> accreting x - ray millisecond pulsars are key systems to understand the spin and accretion history of neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> they are also a good laboratory in which to study the source spectra , pulse profile , and phase shift between x - ray pulses in different energy ranges which give additional information of the x - ray production processes and emission environment .    </S>",
