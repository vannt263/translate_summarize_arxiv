    "one of the interesting aspects of the physics of quantum dots is the mechanism of cotunneling @xcite which governs transport through the quantum dot away from resonance ( `` conductance valley '' ) .",
    "such a mechanism , which usually gives a small ( as compared with resonance values ) yet significant contributions to the conductance , consists of the use of a large number of virtual dot states , which , due to high electrostatic energy , are classically forbidden . as one varies an external parameter ( e.g. applied magnetic field ) , these are virtually the same ( albeit possibly modified ) states that contribute to the transmission , giving rise to significant conductance correlations @xcite . in a recent work",
    "@xcite we have pointed out that such correlations show up in the transmission _ phase _ as well . here",
    "we study the conductance at different valleys ( corresponding to a different number of electrons on the dot , a parameter which is controlled by an applied gate voltage ) and calculate the ensuing conductance correlations .",
    "our formalism , outlined in the present and throughout the next section , follows that of aleiner and glazman @xcite .",
    "we evaluate the significant valley ",
    "valley conductance correlations within the constant interaction model , as function of the strength of the interaction , location in the valley and temperature ( section iii and appendix a ) .",
    "a simplified toy model which , in our opinion , captures much of the pertinent physics , is presented and studied in appendix b. comparison with the experiment ( section iv ) reveals that in reality these correlations are less robust .",
    "possible reasons for this are discussed in section v , where we stress the likelihood of the breakdown of the constant interaction model , accompanied by `` scrambling '' of the dot states as the particle number is varied .",
    "we consider transport through a quantum dot weakly coupled to reservoirs by high tunneling barriers @xcite .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath0 of the quantum dot can be tuned by an applied gate voltage @xmath1 . because of the small size of those structures charging effects are important ; the weak coupling to the external reservoirs ( leads ) implies that , in general , there is a definite number of electrons on the dot .",
    "the conductance of the quantum dot as function of @xmath1 shows nearly equally spaced peaks .",
    "these resonances are due to sequential tunneling of electrons through the dot . at these values of @xmath1 the ground state energies of the system with",
    "the dot containing @xmath2 and @xmath3 electrons are degenerate and the occupation number can fluctuate . in the `` valleys '' between the resonances the conductance",
    "is strongly suppressed due to the charging energy : it costs energy to add or remove electrons to or from the dot , and the number of electrons on the dot is fixed to an integer value .",
    "there is however a residual conductance in the valley between the peaks which is caused by a different transfer process .",
    "an electron or hole tunnels virtually from one reservoir to the other through energetically forbidden states .",
    "since the particle tunnels coherently through the whole structure this transfer mechanism is known as cotunneling @xcite . in the following we will focus on this regime away from the resonances .",
    "we model the quantum dot coupled to the reservoirs by the usual hamiltonian @xmath4 @xmath5 describe the reservoirs to the left and right of the quantum dot , @xmath6 represents the tunneling of electrons in and out of the quantum dot , and @xmath7 describes the states of the isolated quantum dot including the electron - electron interaction .",
    "we use the simplifying `` constant interaction '' model which asserts that the total energy due to the electron - electron interaction solely depends on the total number of electrons on the dot ( @xmath8 is the number operator ) . the charging energy is given by @xmath9 invoking the electrostatic energy of a classical capacitance @xmath10 .",
    "the coupling strength of level @xmath11 of the quantum dot to the leads is characterized by the tunneling rates @xmath12 .",
