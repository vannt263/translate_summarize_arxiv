    "a system of particles in a periodic potential and driven by a time - dependent external force may exhibit a net current even if the force has zero time average .",
    "this so - called particle ratchet effect @xcite is used e.g. in nano - generators of direct charge currents @xcite . to excite the particle ratchet current",
    "it is traditionally believed that the asymmetry of either the periodic potential or driving force is a must . in the quantum regime",
    "a more stringent conclusion has been obtained : in quantum systems in which charged particles populate only one bloch band the charge ratchet effect does not exist , even if the periodic potential is asymmetric , unless time asymmetry is provided by the driving field @xcite .",
    "indeed , the ratchet effect exists in a single - band system which is driven by a field with harmonic mixing @xcite .",
    "the concepts and conclusions mentioned above are based on considering particles as spinless , that is without taking into account any possible impact from switching between the spin states of the particles involved in ratchet transport . in various physical systems",
    "there is a plenty of ways to change the spin states of a particle . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to semiconductor heterostructures with spin - orbit interactions since from the practical point of view these systems are attractive for fabrication of nano - devices .    for semiconductor heterostructures with spin - orbit interactions , described for example by rashba @xcite or dresselhaus @xcite spin - orbit hamiltonians , the _ spin _ ratchet effect",
    "is rooted in an asymmetric excitation of spin dynamics by the orbital dynamics induced by an electric field .",
    "for electrically driven coherent and dissipative systems with rashba spin - orbit interaction ( rsoi ) the spin ratchet mechanism has been confirmed @xcite . even for symmetric periodic potentials and symmetric driving the spin ratchet effect",
    "exists @xcite .",
    "however , the _ charge _ ratchet effect is absent in both the coherent and dissipative cases when both the periodic potential and driving force are symmetric .",
    "this could deepen the impression that a system with symmetric periodic potentials will never respond to time - symmetric external fields via the charge ratchet mechanism and systems with spin - orbit interactions like all other systems obey this habitual rule .",
    "the present work reveals that this is a delusion and in reality systems with spin - orbit interactions provide a unique opportunity to answer the fundamental questions related to the role of symmetries in the charge ratchet phenomena in general .    in this paper",
    "we show that the space asymmetry of the periodic potentials and the time asymmetry of the driving fields , usually required as key properties of charge ratchets , are not necessary as the rashba spin flip processes alone are sufficient even if a dissipative system is time - symmetrically driven .",
    "specifically , it is found that the charge ratchet effect in this case exists for space - symmetric periodic potentials and time - symmetric driving by electric _ and _ magnetic fields .",
    "it stems just from the simultaneous presence of quantum dissipation and the spin flip processes of rashba electrons .",
    "the ratchet charge current in the system is unusual .",
    "its queerness consists in the fact that this current , in contrast to early predictions for systems without spin - orbit interactions @xcite , appears even when only one energy band provides electrons for transport and no harmonic mixing is present in the driving fields .",
    "this charge current is of pure spin - orbit nature and , as a result , it disappears when the spin - orbit coupling strength vanishes",
    ". therefore such spin - orbit charge currents can be controlled by the same gate voltage which controls the strength of the spin - orbit coupling in the system .",
    "it is evident that this peculiarity of the charge ratchet current is very attractive from the experimental point of view .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ model ] presents the model which is solved in section [ solution ] and numerically analyzed in section [ nr ] .",

    "the system interacts with an external environment ( or bath ) : the longitudinal orbital degree of freedom of each electron is coupled to orbital degrees of freedom of the external environment .",

    "we would like to mention that the in - plane electric fields corresponding to @xmath33 , @xmath34 and the driving electric field @xmath35 are assumed to be much weaker than the out - of plane electric field forming the 2deg with rsoi . thus they produce very weak , in comparison with rsoi , spin - orbit interactions which , therefore , may be neglected .",
    "before starting a rigorous exploration one can already anticipate that the magnetic field driving brings a whiff of fresh physics because the spin dynamics can be controlled directly and not only through the spin - orbit interaction mediating between the electric field and electron spins .    to study the charge ratchet effect at low temperatures ,",
    "when only the lowest bloch band of the super - lattice is populated with electrons , we calculate the charge current averaged over one driving period .",
    "this current in the long time limit provides the stationary charge ratchet response of the system .",
    "the common eigenstates of @xmath12 and @xmath36 represent a convenient basis to obtain this response . because of the discrete eigenvalue structure of @xmath12 ( see below )",

    "the eigenstates are denoted as @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 and @xmath37 are the transverse mode and spin quantum numbers , respectively @xcite .",
    "below , in parallel with our main goal for this paper , that is the charge ratchet current , we also provide the results for the spin ratchet current to show that , as in the coherent case @xcite , it also exists in a dissipative system with symmetric periodic potentials and symmetric driving . in the @xmath37-dvr basis the averaged charge and spin currents have a simple form @xcite : @xmath41 in eq .",

    "note that in eq .",
    "( [ ccsc ] ) one has to first calculate the sum and only afterwards to take the limit because the operations of taking limit and infinite summation do not commute as it was proven in refs . .",
    "additionally , the @xmath37-dvr basis allows the path integral formalism to handle the magnetic driving on an equal footing with the standard electric driving since in this basis the whole driving hamiltonian , @xmath46 , is diagonal .    in the long time",
    "limit the populations @xmath42 come from a master equation @xcite which is in this case markovian .",
    "an analytical treatment of this rather complicated problem is possible when the dynamics of @xmath42 is treated within the first two transverse modes , i.e. , @xmath47 .    for a detailed study",
    "we derive the charge and spin currents assuming that the hopping matrix elements between neighboring @xmath37-dvr states are small . following the steps thoroughly described in ref .",

( [ ccscf ] )",
    "tells us that at low temperatures the ratchet charge and spin transport in the system exists just because of spin flip processes . whereas it looks natural for the spin current",
    ", it is a quite unexpected and important result for the charge current .",
    "this current emerges because the magnetic driving changes the charge dynamics . in this case",
    "the spin - orbit interaction plays a role inverse to the one which it plays for the electric driving : the magnetic field exciting spin dynamics induces orbital dynamics through the spin - orbit interaction .",

    "this is in complete accordance with the results obtained earlier @xcite for spinless particles and is clearly demonstrated in our case by the structure of the rashba hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , this hamiltonian has two terms , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the first term does not flip the electron spin and does not lead to the charge ratchet effect while the second one flips the electron spin .",
    "it is exactly this second term which is responsible for the paradoxical situation : charge ratchet effect for a space - symmetric periodic potential , time - symmetric driving and one bloch band transport .",
    "the charge ratchet effect is exclusively based on the spin - flip processes in the isolated system and thus it is fundamentally different from the charge ratchet mechanisms which have been known so far .",
    "the situation , however , is highly non - trivial and the final conclusions about the existence of the ratchet charge and spin flows can not be based only on the presence of spin - orbit interactions",
