    "entanglement , as a term of joint quantum coherence , is one of the most intriguing elements of quantum mechanics and it is crucial in quantum information tasks @xcite .",
    "however the existence of an interacting reservoir or environment that leads to decoherence and/or disentanglement @xcite places an obstacle to the maintenance of joint quantum coherence during any dynamical process @xcite . thus the study and control of entanglement dynamics has received wide attention in recent years ( see reviews @xcite ) .",
    "there have been studies of entanglement dynamics from many points of view .",
    "examples involve open system treatments @xcite or closed quantum scenarios such as cavity qed systems @xcite , spin systems @xcite , etc .",
    "many interesting and sometimes surprising findings such as entanglement sudden death @xcite , sudden birth @xcite , revivals @xcite , dynamical relations with quantum state transfer @xcite , and other exotic types of entanglement evolution have been reported .",
    "such interesting phenomena accompany the idea of tracking entanglement as a carrier of quantum information @xcite , a generalization of entanglement swapping @xcite .",
    "one consequence has been the discovery of examples of non - trivial  information conservation \" among three or more parties @xcite , arising in cases of sufficiently symmetric interaction hamiltonians , or special initial states , or reservoirs that are sufficiently small that their state evolution can be followed in detail , such as in perfect - mirror closed - system cavity qed @xcite and in spin systems @xcite .",
    "however true reservoirs are complex and difficult to follow , especially if mixed state considerations are important .",
    "no general closed - form rules of entanglement transfer are known in such cases .    in this paper",
    "we revisit quantum information flow from a different perspective and derive a new class of entanglement constants of motion .",
    "our approach employs amplitude channel dynamics and avoids information loss by tracing , while remaining open to non - markovian as well as markovian reservoir behavior .",
    "we note that the system of experimental interest , which may be one or more qubits , is almost always prepared in a pure state if possible , and frequently the method of preparation produces a pure entangled state .",
    "this means that the system itself is in a mixed rather than a pure state .",
    "we assume that the entanglement during state preparation , causing the mixedness , arose via interactions that have ceased prior to the beginning of a period of interest at @xmath1 .",
    "this period of interest could simply be intended for quantum memory preservation or for specific state manipulations .",
    "the static disengaged nature of the prior entanglement partner , and also its lack of specificity in our treatment , reduce it to a vague background object in any further qubit evolution , and for this reason we label it the  moon \" .     and",
    "leaves everything else out .",
    "the dashed line indicates its entanglement , but not interaction , with the unspecified background  moon \" @xmath2 .",
    "the arrow represents interaction between @xmath3 and an arbitrarily - dimensioned unit @xmath4 , which can be the quantum vacuum reservoir , a single mode cavity , an xy spin chain , etc.,width=151 ]    a general sketch of our scenario is given in fig .",
    "unit @xmath3 is taken as a two - level system ( qubit ) and unit @xmath4 as a separate quantum system of arbitrary dimension interacting with it , nominally a reservoir .",
    "the moon @xmath2 , i.e. , the non - interacting , unspecified , and completely static background , is entangled via an earlier preparation stage with @xmath3 .",
    "there obviously remains a wide choice for systems acting as environments that promote evolution of the system of interest after @xmath1 .",
    "we will illustrate a range of possibilities with concrete results in various specific interaction contexts : spontaneous emission @xcite , jaynes - cummings ( jc ) cavity dynamics @xcite , and xy spin chain interactions @xcite .",
    "these present very different physical situations and interaction mechanisms , and lead to distinct entanglement dynamics , but they all react similarly to the initial moon entanglement .",
    "our linked information constants arise from amplitude channel dynamics but do not rely on symmetries of the hamiltonian or of any special initial state , in contrast to the cases in some previous work @xcite .",
    "in this section we address our approach to entangled state analysis .",
    "the hamiltonian of our scheme reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the hamiltonians of the qubit system @xmath3 ,  reservoir \" unit @xmath4 and the previously - interacting moon @xmath2 respectively ; and @xmath9 denotes the only existing interaction , that between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we start from the @xmath3-@xmath2 entangled preparation state , i.e. , the joint superposition state @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the excited and ground states of our qubit system @xmath3 , and @xmath13 defined as a complete basis set for @xmath2 .",
    "it need not be the case generally , but we assume in our example that the moon states @xmath14 and @xmath15 are orthogonal , and because @xmath2 is not interacting with either @xmath3 or @xmath4 they are effectively static : @xmath16    we adopt a conventional approach to the interacting partner system labelled @xmath4 , assuming that it is separable from the qubit @xmath3 at @xmath17 , just as in the conventional treatment of a reservoir in quantum open system dynamics @xcite . therefore the entire initial state can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a normalized state of unit @xmath4 , and @xmath20 is a complete basis for @xmath4 .",
    "usually @xmath21 is the ground state of part @xmath4 .",
    "we note that since @xmath2 is not interacting , the evolution of the states @xmath22 and @xmath23 are driven only by the hamiltonian @xmath9 , i.e. , the dynamics of the @xmath3-@xmath4 part can be separated from @xmath2",
    ". therefore we will only need to focus on the @xmath3-@xmath4 dynamics when we study the time evolution .    before we proceed to the time dependent state in various specific models in the following sections",
    ", we will first discuss the initial moon entanglement . as we know , the pure - state relation between the two sides of any bi - partition is an @xmath24 dimensional matrix ( where @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be any numbers or infinite ) that may connote entanglement , but in any event permits a schmidt - type decomposition of the joint state @xcite .",
    "we use the schmidt parameter @xmath27 introduced by grobe , et al . , @xcite as our quantitative measure of entanglement , where @xmath27 is not simply the dimension of the space @xcite but rather relates to the number of schmidt modes that make a significant contribution to the state .",
    "therefore we name this parameter @xmath27 the  schmidt weight \" from now on .",
    "the range of this schmidt weight , @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the effective dimension of the space ) corresponds to the concurrence range @xmath30 , when concurrence @xcite is also applicable .",
    "the upper and lower ends of both ranges denote maximal and zero entanglement , respectively .    the schmidt weight between two parties @xmath31 and @xmath32 of a general pure state @xmath33 is defined as @xmath34^{-1 } ,   \\label{schmidt}\\ ] ] where these @xmath35s are the non - zero eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix for either system , @xmath36 or @xmath37 @xcite : @xmath38=\\mathrm{tr}_{\\alpha } \\big[|\\psi_{\\alpha\\beta}\\rangle\\langle\\psi_{\\alpha\\beta}|\\big ] = cc^{\\dag}.\\ ] ] here @xmath39 is the coefficient matrix connecting the two separate arbitrary complete bases @xmath40 and @xmath41 of systems @xmath31 and @xmath42 respectively , with latexmath:[\\[|\\psi_{\\alpha\\beta}\\rangle=\\sum_{n,\\mu}c(n,\\mu)|n_{\\alpha}\\rangle\\otimes    @xmath35s are also the coefficients of the usual schmidt decomposition @xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the orthonormal schmidt states satisfying @xmath47 .",
    "since a general pure state is usually in some arbitrary basis other than the schmidt basis , it is natural for us to follow the coefficient matrix procedure to calculate the schmidt weight ( [ schmidt ] ) .",
    "accordingly we note from the initial state ( [ initial ] ) that the coefficient matrix for the moon @xmath2 in the basis of @xmath48 , @xmath15 , @xmath49 , ... , and the interacting partner @xmath4 in the basis @xmath20 , is an @xmath50 matrix which is given as @xmath51 where the two - dot sign  @xmath52 \" represents the elements @xmath53 for all the other @xmath54s , while the three - dot sign  @xmath55 \" represents empty rows or columns of zeros for the infinite number of remaining matrix elements .",
    "the reduced density matrix however is simply @xmath56    we note that the qubit has reduced the effective interaction space of the moon to a two dimensional subspace , which means that in this context a two - state subspace of the moon is in fact quite general .",
    "the non - zero eigenvalues of the above matrix are obvious , and the resulting schmidt weight @xmath57 denoting the entanglement between the moon the remainder is given as @xmath58    since the moon @xmath2 is not interacting , its internal dynamics only amount to a local unitary transformation @xcite , which will not affect the entanglement between @xmath2 and the rest , so @xmath59 is independent of time .",
    "we note that there is no moon entanglement ( @xmath60 ) when @xmath61 or 0 . in these cases",
    "the initial state is a trivial product state .",
    "otherwise @xmath62 .",
    "it is particularly interesting when the moon restricts the @xmath3-@xmath4 dynamics and acts as a monitor of the entire entanglement flow .",
    "the following sections take a few specific examples of the @xmath3-@xmath4 interaction to show the role of moon entanglement in their particular entanglement information dynamics .",
    "in this case the qubit system @xmath3 is a two level atom and unit @xmath4 is the quantum vacuum reservoir consisting of the continuum of photon modes .",
    "the atom will of course decay to its ground state asymptotically and irreversibly , while one photon is emitted @xcite .",
    "we write the hamiltonian in the usual way as a sum of atom and reservoir contributions : @xmath63 here @xmath64 is the usual pauli matrix , and the usual boson operators represent the reservoir with a continuum of modes , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 denote the standard creation and annihilation operators respectively , and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the atom and reservoir frequencies . here",
    "@xmath69 , labels the infinitely many modes .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is also standard : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 are the usual raising and lowering pauli operators for the two level system @xmath3 , and the @xmath73s are coupling constants between the reservoir and the atom , for which fundamental expressions are well known @xcite @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the angle between the atomic dipole moment @xmath76 and the electric field polarization vector @xmath77 , and @xmath78 is the quantization volume . according to our generic description in eq .",

    "as defined in the last section , the coefficient matrix between @xmath3 and the remainder for the time dependent state ( [ spon state ] ) is given as @xmath91 where the two - dot sign  @xmath52 \" represents @xmath92 for all the other @xmath54s and the three - dot sign ",

    "this is exactly equal to the moon entanglement @xmath57 , so one can see that the unknown moon s entanglement ( [ moonentanglement ] ) has jumped into the picture .",
    "it is constant itself , but it acts as a kind of buffer to restrict information flow to and from @xmath3 . in another way of speaking , we could say that there is only a certain amount of  free \" entanglement able to be exchanged , which is determined by the moon .    to take a further step and without loss of generality",

    "it is interesting to note that the parameter @xmath124 , which represents a collective coupling between the atom and the reservoir modes , is also controlling the two entanglements inversely .",

    "local entanglement dynamics between the atom and the field in the jc model was first studied by phoenix and knight @xcite by expressing the entangled atom - field state in terms of the eigenstates and eigenvalues of both the field and atomic operators , and revival physics @xcite played a key role in the dynamics .",

    "the new forms of entanglement conservation relations are nonlinear connections between quantum memories , dependent on the restrictions implied by amplitude flow channel dynamics .",
    "one can say that the channel s enforcement of excitation number conservation in the qubit - reservoir interaction is the root cause of the entanglement and its flow .",
    "this is closely analogous to the continuous entanglement between transverse momenta in spontaneous parametric down conversion , which arises from the enforcement of simultaneous momentum and energy conservation on the two - photon amplitude in the creation of the signal and idler photons .",
    "although unspecified , and ignored in previous open system analyses , the moon can be assigned responsibility for the initial impurity of the qubit state . the three - part total universe ( @xmath3 + @xmath4 + @xmath2 ) was bi - partitioned three ways in order to evaluate the respective schmidt weights , as indicators of entanglements in three specific interaction models ( spontaneous emission , jc interaction , and xy spin chain ) .",
    "these were analyzed to illustrate the flow of quantum information in different contexts , including both discrete and continuous versions of the reservoir system labelled @xmath4 .",
    "although the influences on individual entanglements differ in various ways , the amplitude flow common to them produces entanglement conservation relations in the same form .",
    "one can say that the non - specified moon retains a kind of influence on the system of interest whether we are  looking \" ( through interaction ) at it or not .",
    "the qubit can feel , through the entanglement conservation relation but not through interaction , that the moon is there .    there can be interesting consequences when the moon also has a significant dynamical evolution , although still not interacting with @xmath3 , because its entanglement with @xmath3 can then be assigned to part rather than all of it .",
    "this discussion will be undertaken elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally we would like to comment on the inverse dependence of @xmath89 and @xmath90 on the interaction parameters as discussed at the end of our three examples .",
    "it will be particularly interesting if , for some systems , the interaction constant can be adjustable ( e.g. , the coupling constant of a spin - spin interaction ) . especially in the thermodynamic limit interesting phenomena such as quantum phase transitions @xcite",
    "may arise from changes of the interaction parameter .",
    "the behavior of the entanglements in the vicinity of the critical point will be extremely interesting ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",
