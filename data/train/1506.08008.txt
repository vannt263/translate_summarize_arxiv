    "after the higgs boson discovery in 2012  @xcite and subsequent analyses of its properties  @xcite , evidence for physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) remains elusive .",
    "although consistency with sm higgs properties is expected in many bsm scenarios , current measurements do not fully constrain the higgs sector .",
    "one coupling which is currently unconstrained and has recently been subject of much interest is the higgs self - interaction @xmath2 , which is responsible for the spontaneous breaking of electroweak gauge symmetry in the sm via the potential @xmath3 with @xmath4 , where @xmath5 in unitary gauge .",
    "the higgs self - coupling manifests itself primarily in a destructive interference in gluon fusion - induced di - higgs production  @xcite through feeding into the trilinear higgs interaction with strength @xmath6 in the sm .",
    "the latter relation can be altered in bsm scenarios , e.g. the sm coupling pattern can be distorted by the presence of a dimension six operator @xmath7 , and di - higgs production is the only channel with direct sensitivity to this interaction  @xcite . a modification solely of the higgs trilinear coupling , which is typically invoked in di - higgs feasibility studies , is predicted in models of @xmath8-less electroweak symmetry breaking ,  e.g.  @xcite .",
    "after the higgs discovery , analyses of the di - higgs final state at the high - luminosity lhc and beyond have experienced a renaissance , and di - higgs final states such as the @xmath9  @xcite , @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite channels have been studied phenomenologically , often relying on boosted jet substructure techniques  @xcite ( see also an investigation  @xcite of rare decay channels relevant for a 100 tev collider ) .",
    "recent analyses by atlas and cms  @xcite have highlighted the complexity of these analyses and the necessity to explore different production mechanisms to formulate constraints on the higgs self - interactions in the future .",
    "this program has already been initiated by feasibility analyses of the @xmath13 , @xmath0 and @xmath14 production modes in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "di - higgs production in association with two jets is a particularly important channel in this regard since this final state receives contributions from the weak boson fusion ( wbf ) production mode .",
    "the phenomenological appeal of the wbf mode is twofold .",
    "firstly , the weak boson fusion component of @xmath15 is sensitive to modifications of the gauge - higgs sector  @xcite , which can lead to large cross - section enhancements .",
    "secondly , the qcd uncertainties for the wbf topologies are known and under theoretical control  @xcite , such that a search for bsm electroweak - induced deviations is not hampered by qcd systematics .",
    "this situation is very different from qcd - induced production  @xcite , and can be attributed to the particular phenomenology of wbf - like processes  @xcite    however , an additional source of uncertainty that was neglected until recently  @xcite is the correct inclusion of the gluon fusion contribution to @xmath15 analyses .",
    "in contrast to single higgs phenomenology , the correct inclusion of massive fermion thresholds is crucial to a reliable prediction of qcd - induced @xmath16  @xcite .    given that the cross sections in wbf @xmath0 production are very suppressed compared to wbf @xmath17 production ( the wbf @xmath0 cross section is @xmath18 times smaller ) , we have to rely on the dominant hadronic higgs decay modes to be able to observe this final state .",
    "this rules out one of the most crucial single higgs wbf selection tools - the central jet veto  @xcite .",
    "the observation of wbf - induced @xmath19 production is further hampered by the top threshold in the qcd - mediated process .",
    "since the top threshold sets the scale of the di - higgs subsystem , an analysis that tries to retain as many low @xmath20 higgs bosons as possible leads to a qcd contribution that dominates over the wbf component when minimal wbf - like cut requirements are imposed  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the discussion of ref .",
    "@xcite in a number of directions .",

    "we compare the qcd - induced @xmath19 phenomenology to the wbf signature in sec .",
    "[ sec : wbf ] before we discuss general approaches to isolate the signal from the dominant top backgrounds in a hadron level analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : tt ] .",
    "this sets the stage for a discussion about the prospects to isolate the wbf and gf components in secs .",
    "[ sec : isolgf ] and [ sec : isolwbf ] , followed by a study on constraining @xmath21 couplings using the wbf induced signal in section  [ sec : limitzeta ] .",
    "we focus on collisions with @xmath22 tev throughout .",
    "it is well known that effective field theory approximations in the @xmath23 limit can not be invoked to study di - higgs final states at colliders in a reliable way due to the effects of top - quark threshold  @xcite .",
    "further , the breakdown of the @xmath24 approximation is worsened in the presence of additional jet emission  @xcite .",
    "finite @xmath25 effects must therefore be considered for all qcd di - higgs production channels , which will be required to set the best limits on the higgs self - coupling or formulate a realistic estimate of the gf contribution in a wbf - like selection .",
    "lccc @xmath26 & @xmath27 [ fb ] & @xmath28 [ fb ] & @xmath29 [ fb ] + gf & 10.73 & 5.502 & 2.669 + wbf & 4.141 & 2.010 & 0.9648 +    the computational challenges in qcd - mediated @xmath0 production are significant , with the gluon - fusion channels particularly time consuming even when using state - of - the - art techniques .",
    "the standard method of simulating a differential cross section from unweighted events is not feasible in this case , and we instead use a reweighting technique that is exploited in higher order calculations and experimental analyses  ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we generate gf @xmath0 events by implementing the relevant higher dimensional operators in the @xmath23 limit obtained by expanding the low - energy effective theory  @xcite @xmath30 in madevent v5.1  @xcite using the feynrules / ufo  @xcite framework .",

    "this allows us to sample a weighted set of events that we subsequently feed into our analysis solely depending on their final state kinematics . if an event passes the selection requirements of a certain search region , we correct for the full mass dependence using a reweighting library based on gosam package  @xcite at this stage .",
    "the reweighting employs exactly the same matrix elements used for the event generation and the trilinear coupling is steered through a modification of the matrix element , i.e. variations of the trilinear coupling are part of the reweighting .",
    "a selection of feynman diagrams which contribute to the gluon fusion signal are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample_gf ] .",
    "the code used for the reweighting is based on a feynman diagrammatic approach using  @xcite and  @xcite for the diagram generation , and  @xcite ,  @xcite and to write an optimised fortran output .",
    "the reduction of the one - loop amplitudes was done using  @xcite , which uses a @xmath31-dimensional integrand level decomposition based on unitarity methods  @xcite .",
    "the remaining scalar integrals have been evaluated using  @xcite .",
    "alternative reduction techniques can be used employing  @xcite or  @xcite . to validate the reweighting procedure we regenerated the code that has been used in  @xcite with the improvements that became available within , in particular improvements in code optimisation and in the reduction of the amplitudes . for the reduction we used , which employs an improved reduction algorithm based on an laurent expansion of the integrand .",
    "this leads to substantial improvements in both speed and numerical stability compared to the previous version .",
    "we combined the code with a phase space integration provided by madevent  @xcite .",
    "further substantial speed - up has been obtained by monte carlo sampling over the helicities rather then performing the helicity sum .",
    "this enabled us to perform a full phase space integration and we found full agreement within the statistical uncertainties between the result obtained from reweighting and the result from the full phase space integration .",
    "top thresholds are particularly prominent in the di - higgs invariant mass distribution , which is thus well suited to benchmark the relation of the finite @xmath25 limit to the effective theory of eq .",
    "( [ eq : efft ] ) .",
    "other observables constructed from the six particle final state are also relevant when performing a targeted phenomenological analysis , and we discuss both these and the phase space dependent parton - level reweighting in detail in the following .    in figures  [ fig : pt ] , [ fig : jets ] , and [ fig : hjet ] we show a selection of @xmath0 final state observables for inclusive cuts @xmath32 and @xmath33 , no cuts on higgs bosons are imposed .",
    "we label higgs bosons and jets according to their hardness , i.e. @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the cross sections are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : xsnormalisation ] .",
    "the inclusive gluon fusion cross section is about 2.5 times larger than the wbf cross section approximately independent of the value of the higgs trilinear coupling .",
    "as previously established in  @xcite the di - higgs system is badly modelled by the effective theory which under- and overshoots the full theory cross section at low and high momenta respectively . for @xmath19 this is a qualitatively similar behaviour compared the @xmath36 production : the @xmath37 distribution is the crucial observable which parametrises the finite top quark mass effects .",
    "the eft describes the low maximum transverse higgs momenta @xmath38 reasonably well , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pth ] .",
    "the jet emission on the other hand integrates over a considerable range of @xmath37 , and the ratio of full theory vs effective theory smaller than one for the finite @xmath25 limit produces a smaller integrated cross section than the @xmath23 limit for the jet kinematics .    considering just the dijet system in fig .",
    "[ fig : jets ] , we observe that the jet kinematics is not severely impacted by the reweighting procedure upon marginalising over the di - higgs kinematics . the phase space dependence of the dijet invariant mass fig .",
    "[ fig : mjj ] is relatively mild aside from the total rescaling of the inclusive cross sections , and the ratio for the pseudo - rapidity distribution of the jets is nearly flat , fig .  [",
    "fig : etajj ] .",
    "this is also true for the azimuthal angle difference @xmath39 .",
    "the angular distributions of the leading members of the jet - higgs system are relatively mildly impacted by the reweighting too fig .",
    "[ fig : etahj ] .",
    "this agrees with the @xmath37 being the observable most sensitive to the top threshold ( as in @xmath36 ) , and is also supported by the larger impact of the reweighting of @xmath37 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhh ] . a reweighting based on @xmath37 to correct for finite top mass effects suggests itself for future analyses as a time - saving approach with reasonable accuracy .",
    "the weak boson fusion contribution to @xmath19 has received considerable attention recently and precise higher - order qcd corrections have been provided in  @xcite . due to the sensitivity of the wbf contribution to both the trilinear coupling and the quartic @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , as shown in the feynman diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample_wbf ] , weak boson fusion to two higgs bosons can , in principle , provide complementary information about bsm physics which remains uncaptured in @xmath36 and @xmath42  @xcite .",
    "we generate wbf samples with varying @xmath26 using madevent v4  @xcite and normalise the cross section to nlo accuracy  @xcite .",
    "the wbf @xmath0 contribution shares the qcd properties of wbf @xmath17 production @xcite which means it shares the distinctive @xmath43 distribution shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : wbfeta ] : to produce the heavy di - higgs pair we probe the initial state partons at large momentum fractions .",
    "this together with a colour - neutral @xmath44-channel exchange of the electroweak bosons  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) leads to energetic back - to - back jet configurations at large rapidity separation and moderate transverse momenta with a centrally produced higgs pair . the production of an additional higgs boson in comparison to single higgs production via wbf leads to a cross section reduction by three orders of magnitude ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : xsnormalisation ] ) in the sm .",
    "such a small inclusive production cross section highlights the necessity of considering dominant higgs decay channels such as @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the non - availability of central jet vetos @xcite as a means to control the background _ and _ gf contribution in a targeted analysis as a consequence .",
    "the gluon fusion contribution is bigger by a factor of 2.5 than the wbf component of @xmath0 production , however , with increasing invariant di - higgs mass the wbf contribution is enhanced relative to gf production as a consequence of the suppression above the @xmath47 threshold , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gfwbfmhh ] .",
    "+    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , > \" , ]     since we can not rely on vetoing hadronic activity in the central part of the detector , a potential discrimination of gf from wbf needs to be built on the following strategy , which we will investigate in sec .",
    "[ sec : tt ] :    * to isolate the di - higgs ( wbf+gf ) signal we can exploit the relative hardness of the di - higgs pair which peaks around @xmath48 .",
    "such hard events are less likely to be produced by ( ir)reducible backgrounds .",
    "* focussing on large @xmath37 we can enhance wbf over gf by stringent cuts on the jet rapidity separation .",
    "this will also imply a significant decrease of qcd - dominated backgrounds .",
    "* by explicitly allowing central jet activity , we can exploit the colour correlation differences in wbf vs gf to further purify our selection . since colour flow is tantamount to energy flow in the detector ,",
    "event shapes are particularly well - suited observables for unravelling the colour correlations in the final state once the reconstructed di - higgs pair has been removed .",
    "this strategy was first proposed for single higgs analyses in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "for our hadron - level analysis we shower our signal samples with herwig++  @xcite and generate backgrounds as follows : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 with sherpa  @xcite , and @xmath53 with madevent v5 .",

    "higgs branching ratios are set to the values agreed upon by the higgs cross section working group  @xcite .",
    "we begin the hadron - level analysis implemented in rivet  @xcite by recreating a base selections similar to  @xcite :    1 .",

    "the signal and background cross sections after these cuts are presented in the base selection column of table  [ tab : xstable ] .",
    "we find that the background contribution of @xmath49 dominates with @xmath50 also providing a larger - than - signal background resulting in @xmath69 , making a study based only on these selections extremely challenging .",
    "since we only have @xmath70 expected gluon fusion and @xmath71 expected weak boson fusion events at 3 ab@xmath1 luminosity , additional selections must also be careful to retain enough signal cross section to allow statistically meaningful statements to be made with a finite amount of data .",
    "shape comparisons for the rapidity and dihiggs invariant mass distributions as motivated in the previous section are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : basehadronlvl ] . indeed , as expected , cutting on the angular distance of the jets will serve to both purify towards a wbf - only selection at a reduced background rate .",
    "the dominant backgrounds are unlikely to produce a large invariant mass @xmath37 .",
    "however the wbf contribution , due to the lack of the @xmath47 threshold peaks at a considerably lower invariant mass , leading to significant decrease of the wbf contribution for a reasonably strong cut on @xmath37 , which is required to observe the @xmath0 signal at the given low signal yield , even at 3 ab@xmath1 luminosity .",
    "+      we can extend the analysis outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : tt ] with the aim to purify the selection towards the gf component .",
    "we make use of the hard higgs candidates to greatly reduce the backgrounds by requiring @xmath72 gev and additionally require @xmath73 to minimise the weak boson fusion contribution .",
    "the signal and background cross sections after these cuts are applied are presented in the ` gf selection ' column of table  [ tab : xstable ] .",
    "the total background is reduced by a factor of @xmath74 while the gluon fusion contribution only is reduced by a factor of @xmath75 which allows for an encouraging @xmath76 with 3 ab@xmath1 of data .",
    "the weak boson fusion contribution is also suppressed compared to gf which allows for a clean probe of the physics accessible in the gluon fusion contribution .",
    "similarly we can extend the analysis towards isolating the wbf component .",
    "since it has slightly softer higgs candidates we require @xmath77 gev and @xmath78 to reduce both the gluon fusion and background contributions .",
    "the signal and background cross sections after these cuts are applied are presented in the ` wbf selection ' column of table  [ tab : xstable ] .",
    "the total background is reduced by a factor of @xmath79 while three times more of the weak boson fusion contribution is retained compared to the gf selection , resulting in @xmath80 with 3 ab@xmath1 of data due to the large reduction in the gluon fusion contribution .",
    "however even so the wbf selection is composed of one - to - three parts gf to wbf , which means measurements of physics that only enters the weak boson fusion contribution will need to take this gluon fusion `` pollution '' into account .      as mentioned in section  [ sec : wbf ] there is a contribution from quartic @xmath21 vertices to the wbf induced signal , and modifications of the corresponding @xmath81 couplings away from their sm values using the higgs cross section working group @xmath82 framework @xcite will greatly enhance the signal cross section .",
    "this allows us to constrain @xmath83 defined by @xmath84 . to achieve this",
    "we have generated events with varying @xmath83 using madevent v5 and applied the wbf selections described in section  [ sec : isolwbf ] to estimate the enhancement of the signal , which is compared to expected cross section limits on the signal with 3 ab@xmath1 of data in the wbf selection under the assumptions of no systematic uncertainties and 20% total systematic uncertainties for comparison .",
    "the results are presented in figure  [ fig : zetalimits ] .",
    "we find that in the more realistic scenario of 20% systematic uncertainties the expected constraint on the @xmath81 couplings is @xmath85 at 95% confidence level .",
    "a measurement of @xmath19 is therefore crucial to constrain new physics which enters predominantly through enhancements to @xmath86 .",
    "the analysis strategies outlined so far have mainly relied on exploiting correlations in the di - higgs system , with only @xmath87 carrying information about the tagging jets . following similar applications in the context of single higgs production @xcite",
    ", we investigate a range of event shapes in the tagging jets system in the following , which could offer additional discriminating power through capturing colour correlations in the different signal contributions beyond angular dependencies .",
    "more specifically , we will focus on @xmath88-jettiness @xcite and thrust major which provided the best results .",
    "we calculate @xmath88-jettiness by minimising @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a normalisation which cancels when taking the ratio of two @xmath91s , the sum is taken over all visible momenta which do not belong to one of the identified higgs candidates within @xmath92 , and @xmath93 is the distance in the @xmath94 plane between the @xmath95-th momentum and the @xmath96-th reference vector .",
    "@xmath97 is then explicitly given by @xmath98 .",
    "thrust major is defined by    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the normalised thrust vector @xmath101    again the sums run over all visible momenta which do not belong to one of the identified higgs candidates within @xmath92 .",
    "we find @xmath97 and @xmath102 show promise for improving the wbf selection , but the signal cross section is already too low for us to be able to make meaningful use of this insight .",
    "the @xmath97 and @xmath102 distributions after the gf and wbf selections have been applied are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : evtshape ] . cutting , e.g. , on @xmath103 , the gluon fusion contribution is reduced by 80% , while the wbf contribution is reduced by only 55% amounting to a total of 2 expected wbf and 0.3 expected gf events , with backgrounds very strongly suppressed .",
    "this means that wbf can in principle be observed at a small rate that can be used to set constraints on new physics in an almost gf - free selection with greatly reduced backgrounds .",
    "the event shape distributions can also be used to greatly reduce the background in the gf selection , fig .",
    "[ fig : gfthrustmaj ] .",
    "it should be noted that these improvements of gf vs wbf vs background ultimately depend on underlying event and pile up conditions and have to be taken with a grain of salt at this stage early in run 2 .",
    "however the clear separation that can be achieved with these observables indicate that an analysis employing mva techniques could , at least in theory , significantly improve the results presented here .",
    "these techniques may also prove useful at a 100  tev collider where the dihiggs production cross - section is substantially higher  @xcite .",
    "after discovering single higgs production at the large hadron collider , new analysis strategies need to be explored to further constrain the presence of new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "higgs pair production is pivotal in this regard as constraints from multi - higgs production contain complementary information , in particular with respect to the higgs boson s self - interaction .",
    "cross sections for di - higgs production are generically small at the lhc , which highlights the necessity to explore other viable channels than @xmath104 to enhance sensitivity in a combined fit at high luminosity . to this end",
    ", we have investigated @xmath15 production in detail in this paper . keeping the full top and bottom mass dependencies , we find sensitivity of @xmath19 searches at the lhc for production in the sm and beyond .",
    "the gluon fusion contribution remains important at high invariant di - higgs masses where the dominant backgrounds can be suppressed to facilitate a reasonable signal vs background discrimination .",
    "unfortunately , the gluon fusion contribution remains large even for selections that enhance the weak boson fusion fraction of @xmath19 events .",
    "this `` pollution '' is important when such selections are employed to set constraints on new physics effects that enter in the wbf contribution exclusively .",
    "large new physics effects in the wbf contribution can still be constrained , which we have illustrated through an investigation of the constraints that can be set on deviations of the quartic @xmath21 couplings from their sm values with the hl - lhc , demonstrating that a measurement of @xmath19 will provide a powerful probe of these . employing observables which are intrinsically sensitive to the different colour correlation of wbf compared to gf , the discrimination between gf , wbf , and background can be further improved . however , the signal cross section is typically already too small to use such a strategy to constrain the presence of new physics if those effects are only a small deviation around the sm .",
    "if new physics effects are sizable , such an approach will remain a well - adapted strategy to minimise gf towards a pure wbf selection .",

    "<S> the search for di - higgs production at the lhc in order to set limits on higgs trilinear coupling and constraints on new physics is one of the main motivations for the lhc high luminosity phase . </S>",
    "<S> recent experimental analyses suggest that such analyses will only be successful if information from a range of channels is included . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore investigate di - higgs production in association with two hadronic jets and give a detailed discussion of both the gluon- and weak boson fusion contributions , with a particular emphasis on the phenomenology with modified higgs trilinear and quartic gauge couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a detailed investigation of the full hadronic final state and find that @xmath0 production should add sensitivity to a di - higgs search combination at the hl - lhc with 3  ab@xmath1 . since the wbf and gf contributions are sensitive to different sources of physics beyond the standard model , we devise search strategies to disentangle and isolate these production modes . while gluon fusion remains non - negligible in wbf - type selections , sizeable new physics contributions to the latter can still be constrained . as an example of the latter point we investigate the sensitivity that can be obtained for a measurement of the quartic higgs - gauge boson couplings . </S>"
