    "recent discoveries of ever lower - mass planets have received a great deal of publicity . equally important , however , are discoveries of long - period planets .",
    "a long - standing question in astrophysics is `` how common are planetary systems like our own solar system ? '' the so - called `` jupiter analogs , '' with orbital periods @xmath0 10 years and velocity amplitudes @xmath1 10 , represent another means for probing the frequency of systems with architectures similar to our solar system11.86yr and @xmath212.5 . ] .",
    "such planets are now within the reach of the longest - running radial - velocity planet - search programs . a critical part of addressing the key question of solar system frequency is assessing the selection effects at work in the regime of long - period , jovian planets .",
    "microlensing observations are beginning to be effective in detecting and constraining the population of jupiter - like planets .",
    "the gravitational microlensing technique is well - suited to detecting planets which have not experienced significant inward migration , typically at separations @xmath3  au ( cf .  fig .  9 from sumi et al .  2010 ) .",
    "the discovery of a jupiter / saturn analog by @xcite illustrates the power of the microlensing technique to detect planets which are currently beyond the reach ( in both observation time and precision ) of doppler measurements .",
    "@xcite presented the first estimate of the frequency of planets beyond the snow line , based on a sample of 6 microlensing planet discoveries .",
    "previously published analyses of radial - velocity data sets have been able to place upper limits on substellar and planetary companions from radial - velocity surveys .",
    "@xcite determined detection limits for the mt .",
    "john radial - velocity program by adding the program s mean velocity error ( 65 ) to the signals of planets in circular orbits .",
    "planetary signals were then recovered by the periodogram and f - test methods , and those planets for which 95% of phases were recovered with false - alarm probability ( fap)@xmath41% were considered detectable .",
    "they were able to exclude planets with m  sin  @xmath510  with periods less than 2000 days , and brown dwarf companions ( 10 - 40 ) with @xmath6 years .",
    "similarly , @xcite computed detection limits from the lick planet search data by 1 ) noting the highest peak @xmath7 in the periodogram for each target , and 2 ) generating simulated data sets with sinusoidal ( circular - orbit ) signals and finding the velocity amplitude @xmath8 for which 99% of signals had power exceeding @xmath7 .",
    "they achieved a detection limit of 20  for companions with @xmath95 au .",
    "the 12-year cfht survey of @xcite , with a velocity precision of 15 , achieved detection limits approaching a jupiter mass for planets in circular orbits and periods shorter than @xmath1010  yr .",
    "@xcite combined the data of @xcite with data from the mcdonald observatory planet search to achieve a baseline of more than 20 years for a sample of 31 bright solar - type stars .",
    "those authors estimated a 99% detection limit of 2.0@xmath111.1  for planets in jupiter - like",
    "orbits ( @xmath12 , @xmath13=5.2 au ) .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a detailed analysis of 8 years of keck planet search data ( 585 stars with @xmath1410 measurements ) , resulting in a typical detection limit of 10  for periods less than the duration of the observations . from those data",
    ", @xcite estimated a giant planet ( 0.3 - 10 ) frequency of 10.5% for orbital periods less than 2000 days .",
    "the anglo - australian planet search ( aaps ) has been in operation since 1998 january , and currently monitors 250 stars .",
    "the aaps has achieved a long - term radial - velocity precision of 3  or better since its inception , which is enabling the detection of long - period giant planets .",
    "these planets have typical velocity amplitudes @xmath1515 , and their detection requires superb long - term velocity stability .",
    "some notable recent aaps detections of such planets include hd  134987c ( jones et al .",
    "2010 : @xmath16yr , m  sin  @xmath17=0.82 , @xmath18 ) and gj  832b ( bailey et al .",
    "2009 : @xmath19yr , m  sin  @xmath17=0.64 , @xmath20 ) .",
    "the long - term precision of the aat / ucles system has enabled the aaps to be relatively efficient at detecting long - period planets . of the planets discovered by the aaps , 37@xmath1111% have periods longer than 1000 days . for comparison ,",
    "this figure is 29@xmath115% for the lick & keck program , 18@xmath114% for harps+coralie+elodie , and 14@xmath116% for all other planet - search teams .",
    "these figures are obtained by counting the number of planets with @xmath211000 days discovered by each group , then dividing by the total number of planets discovered by that group .",
    "as the aaps now spans 12 years , it is important to make quantitative estimates of the population of detectable jupiter analogs in our sample and in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "here we define a `` jupiter analog '' as a planet with a small eccentricity ( @xmath22 ) and a long period ( @xmath08 yr ) .",
    "that is , a giant planet which plays a dynamical role similar to that of our own jupiter , with a period long enough to imply _ in situ _ formation , and an eccentricity low enough to suggest a benign dynamical history . in this paper",
    ", we present detection limits for jupiter analogs from the 12-year aaps database .",
    "section  2 briefly describes the observational data , and section  3 discusses the techniques used to calculate detection limits . in section  4 , we present the results , and in section  5 we discuss the results in the broader context of the population of long - period planets .",
    "aaps doppler measurements are made with the ucles echelle spectrograph @xcite .",
    "an iodine absorption cell provides wavelength calibration from 5000 to 6200 .",
    "the spectrograph point - spread function and wavelength calibration are derived from the iodine absorption lines embedded on every pixel of the spectrum by the cell @xcite .",
    "the result is a precision doppler velocity estimate for each epoch , along with an internal uncertainty estimate , which includes the effects of photon - counting uncertainties , residual errors in the spectrograph psf model , and variation in the underlying spectrum between the iodine - free template , and epoch spectra observed through the iodine cell .",
    "all velocities are measured relative to the arbitrary zero - point defined by the template observation .",
    "the aaps target list contains 254 stars , of which 180 have been observed for more than 8 years . since the aim of this work is to place meaningful limits on jupiter analogs , here",
    "we only consider those stars which have more than 8 years of data ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "we further restrict the sample to those stars which have been observed more than 30 times ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "this is because the reliability of the fap calculation is strongly dependent on the number of data points .",
    "table  [ rvdata1 ] summarises the data characteristics for these 123 stars . for those stars with long - term trends indicating a distant stellar companion ,",
    "a linear or quadratic fit was removed from the data before subjecting them to the detection - limit procedure . for stars known to host a substellar companion , we did a fit for and removed that orbit and then performed the detection - limit computations on the residuals .",
    "a set of simulations such as these is only as meaningful as the input assumptions and parameters . in this section ,",
    "we give a detailed discussion of our choices for these simulations .",
    "the detection limits were computed using the method of @xcite . in brief , we add a keplerian signal to the existing velocity data , then attempt to recover that signal using a lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "the mass of the simulated planet is increased until 99% of the injected signals are recovered with fap@xmath40.1% . for a given mass ( or equivalently , a given velocity amplitude ) at a given orbital period ,",
    "we use a grid of 30 values of periastron passage @xmath25 and , for eccentric orbits , 18 values of the periastron argument @xmath26 spaced evenly every 20 degrees .",
    "this makes a total of 30 possible orbital configurations for simulated planets with @xmath12 , and 540 configurations for those with eccentric orbits .",
    "we simulated planets over 100 orbital periods ranging from 1000 to 5000 days , evenly spaced in the logarithm of the period . for a simulated planet with amplitude @xmath8 to be considered detectable at the 99% level , we must recover 99% of configurations ( 30/30 for circular orbits , 535/540 for eccentric orbits ) .",
    "a successful recovery occurs when the injected period is the highest peak in the periodogram , has a fap less than 0.1% , and the recovered period is within a specified tolerance of the injected period ; section  3.2 gives additional details on the selection of this tolerance .",
    "in addition to the 99% recovery level , we performed these simulations at recovery levels of 90 , 70 , and 50% , to maintain consistency with our previous simulation work @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we refer to each set of simulations by its eccentricity and recovery rate : for example , the set where @xmath27 at 90% recovery is referred to as `` e01r90 . ''",
    "the result of these simulations is , for each star , a plot of the @xmath8 amplitude ( or planet mass ) recovered in ( 99% , 90% , 70% , 50% ) of trials at each orbital period between 1000 and 5000 days .",
    "figure  [ fapsplot ] , which shows the distribution of fap for all simulated signals which were considered successfully recovered in the e00r99 trials , demonstrates our reasoning in choosing a cutoff criterion of fap@xmath40.1% .",
    "summed over all 123 stars , the histogram includes results from 362368 simulated signals . though the cutoff criterion was fap@xmath40.1% ( 0.001 ) , it is evident that the vast majority of recovered signals achieved fap values that are far more significant .",
    "the distribution has two peaks , at @xmath28 ( @xmath2912000 ) and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the latter of these is an artifact , simply representing the integration over a long tail of fap@xmath30 .",
    "if most trials resulted in fap@xmath32 , the cutoff we have imposed would bias the derived detection limits .",
    "we would see such an effect in figure  [ fapsplot ] as a pile - up at the least significant bin ( fap@xmath33 ) .",
    "that the highest peaks in figure  [ fapsplot ] lie at fap levels at least an order of magnitude more significant than the imposed cutoff indicates that our choice of cutoff has not biased the results .    in order to focus on potential jupiter analogs",
    ", we only consider simulated planets with @xmath12 , 0.1 , and 0.2 , in keeping with the @xmath22 definition of `` jupiter analog '' described in section  1 .",
    "these three values of @xmath34 provide sufficient sampling of the relevant eccentricity range because , for long - period planets ( @xmath211000 days ) , the orbital eccentricity is typically determined only to an accuracy of 0.02 - 0.04 .",
    "figure  [ eccentricities ] shows a histogram of the uncertainty in eccentricity ( @xmath35 ) for the 74 published planets with @xmath211000 days .",
    "the peak of the distribution lies at @xmath36 0.02 - 0.04 , with a median value of 0.05 .",
    "we also note that published estimates of @xmath35 are often underestimated due to correlations between the keplerian orbital parameters and the non - gaussianity of their distributions @xcite . in particular , @xcite found that the 99% confidence interval for eccentricity can be 10 - 50 times larger than the traditional uncertainty estimates derived from the covariance matrix in a least - squares keplerian fit .",
    "this is particularly important when the signal of the planet ( defined in otoole et al .",
    "2009a as @xmath37 ) is smaller than about 3 . for these reasons",
    ", we have chosen a coarse grid of eccentricities for these simulations .",
    "a finer interval would vastly increase the computing time required without adding meaningful information .",
    "all previous implementations of this detection - limit algorithm @xcite have used the criterion that the recovered period be within 5% of the input period of the simulated planet .",
    "the reason for this seemingly arbitrary criterion is that in the lomb - scargle periodogram , spurious peaks can arise due to the sampling of the data .",
    "most common in radial - velocity data are the 1-year and 1-month aliases , the former due to targets becoming unobservable as they pass behind the sun , and the latter due to telescope scheduling constraints which usually restrict planet - search observations to bright lunations",
    ". harmonics of the injected periodicities ( e.g.  @xmath38,@xmath39 , etc . ) also often produce significant periodogram peaks .",
    "imposing the `` correct - period '' criterion reduces the effect of these features and thus minimises incorrect detections ( false positives ) . for simulations such as these , involving a vast number of attempted planetary detections and using automated detection criteria ,",
    "it is critical to understand and to minimise ( or ideally , to eliminate ) false positives . @xcite",
    "presented a detailed discussion of the problem of false positives in simulations of planet - search data .",
    "a potential pitfall in establishing detection criteria to minimise false positives is that , if those criteria are too stringent , false _ negatives _ become important .",
    "false negatives ( i.e.  incorrect rejections ) are substantially more difficult to quantify , and hence are fiendishly difficult to control . in practice , because scientists rightfully consider incorrect detections to be a far more serious problem , much more effort is spent in eliminating false positives than false negatives . in the detection - limit algorithm",
    "described above , we seek to eliminate false positives by the imposition of the `` correct - period '' criterion .",
    "the fap criterion alone ( fap@xmath40.001 ) eliminates some incorrect detections , but since the fap calculation is dependent on the number of data points , even alias periodicities achieve high significance for larger data sets ( @xmath4050 ) .",
    "we performed some tests with aaps data ( which have @xmath41 for many targets ) , removing the correct - period criterion and relying on only the fap criterion to eliminate false detections .",
    "figure  [ blind ] shows the effect of different settings for the fap criterion in this test . as expected , requiring a more significant periodogram recovery ( i.e.  a lower fap cutoff ) reduces the false - positive rate .",
    "however , there are two important consequences : 1 ) the false - positive rate remains at a nontrivial level even for extremely stringent fap levels , and 2 ) when the fap cutoff is set to such low levels , the detection - limit result is dominated by false negatives : nearly all of the injected trial signals are rejected , and no meaningful detection limit is obtained .",
    "these tests demonstrated that a correct - period constraint is necessary to obtain useful detection limits and to control the false positive rate .",
    "the next question is then : how close to the input period does the recovered period need to be , to be considered a successful detection ? too loose a constraint would degrade the scientific value of the detection limits obtained from this method , whereas too stringent a constraint results in the automated rejection of signals which a rational human investigator would consider sufficiently close ( e.g.  p=3.05 versus 3.04 days ) .",
    "the core question is : `` what would a human do ? ''",
    "one way to approach this problem is to determine what other humans have already done .",
    "that is , what is the fractional uncertainty in orbital period at which authors have decided to publish a planet detection ?",
    "radial - velocity planet search teams generally prefer to wait until a complete orbital cycle has been observed before publishing a planet discovery .",
    "one expects the uncertainty in the fitted period ( @xmath42 ) to drop as more orbital cycles are observed .",
    "we performed an exhaustive literature search , locating the original discovery paper for every radial - velocity planet , and tabulating the period ( @xmath43 ) , period uncertainty ( @xmath42 ) , and the total time - span of the observations ( @xmath44 ) . in this search , we included only those planets : 1 ) which were originally detected by the radial - velocity method , and 2 ) where a refereed paper is available indicating the above - mentioned quantities .",
    "the reason for excluding planets discovered by transits is that the transit is a special circumstance which enables the orbital period to be determined to extremely high precision .",
    "that would skew the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath44 , which we seek to apply to the radial - velocity database of the anglo - australian planet search ( which includes no transiting planets ) .",
    "the results of this search are shown in figure  [ published ] .",
    "one readily evident feature is that no planets have been published with less than 0.7 cycles of data ( vertical dashed line in the figure ) . of the 290 planets ,",
    "only 24 ( 8.3% ) were published with less than one orbital cycle of data .",
    "the outlier with an unusually large fractional error in period ( @xmath45=17.2% ) is hd  149143 @xcite .",
    "that planet was first published with only 17 observations , which may account for the large uncertainty in its 4-day period .",
    "we wish to derive a relation between the data span @xmath44 ( equivalently , the number of cycles ) , and the period error @xmath45 ; however , the number statistics of the known planets remain poor .",
    "hence , we performed some additional simulations to fill out the @xmath44-@xmath45 plane .",
    "for each of 210 stars in the aaps database , we created 2000 simulated radial - velocity datasets .",
    "each simulated dataset used the observation times and velocity uncertainties of the original observed data .",
    "the simulated planets had periods ranging from 5 to 5000 days ( in a grid with a uniform spacing of 10 days ) , velocity amplitudes between 20 - 50 , and eccentricities randomly drawn from the range @xmath46 .",
    "noise ( jitter ) drawn from a gaussian distribution with a width @xmath47  was also added to each simulated velocity measurement .",
    "we then fit each dataset with a keplerian model using gaussfit @xcite and recorded the fitted period and its uncertainty . since the maximum period used sometimes significantly exceeded the length of the available data for certain of the targets in the aaps database , those fits often produced unphysical results , and",
    "were discarded .",
    "consistent with the characteristics of published planets described above , we also discarded all fits where less than 0.7 cycles of data were present . of the 420000 simulations , 357681 remained after these cuts , and the results are plotted in figure  [ simulated ] .",
    "we can now use these results to make an informed choice for the correct - period constraint . since the injected trial period is assumed not to be known _ a priori _ , it is logical to choose the value of @xmath45 which includes 99% of the planets simulated in this section .",
    "this results in @xmath48 , which is the value used for the correct - period constraint in all detection - limit simulations here .",
    "finally , we show in figure  [ examples ] examples of a rejected and an accepted recovery using the methods described in this section .",
    "an input data file ( hd  209653 ) was chosen at random for this demonstration .",
    "the left panel shows the periodogram resulting from an injected signal with @xmath491000 days , @xmath2 1 , and @xmath500.0 .",
    "as expected with such a weak signal , there is no compelling evidence for it in the periodogram ; the highest peaks occur at 9.7 and 365 days , the latter an artefact of the window function ( lower panels ) .",
    "the fap of the 9.7-day peak was 0.018 , much less significant than the cutoff of 0.001 .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ examples ] shows the periodogram resulting from the same dataset with an injected signal having @xmath491000 days , @xmath2 10 , and @xmath500.0 .",
    "the peak at 1000 days is quite obvious , and its fap is 0.0005 , resulting in a successful recovery .",
    "due to the large number of stars considered here , it is most efficient to present the detection - limit results in terms of the radial - velocity amplitude @xmath8 which the simulations indicate was detectable . since the targets in the aaps long - term program are typically solar - type stars , one can then estimate the mass thresholds by assuming a 1  star .",
    "figure  [ khisto1 ] shows the distribution of @xmath8 resulting from the @xmath12 simulations , summed over all stars ( 123 stars ; 12300 @xmath8 values ) .",
    "as noted in previous work using this detection - limit algorithm @xcite , some injected trial periods can result in apparently undetectable signals , due to poor time sampling or large velocity scatter in the input data .",
    "circular - orbit results are shown in figure  [ khisto1 ] , @xmath27 results are shown in figure  [ khisto2 ] , and @xmath51 results are shown in figure  [ khisto3 ] .    for a given star ,",
    "the detection limit in @xmath8 is generally constant over the entire range of trial periods shorter than the duration of observations .",
    "figure  [ kexample ] shows the detection limit in @xmath8 for three representative stars .",
    "it is useful , then , to compute the mean value of @xmath8 as the metric of the quality of a star s detection limit . for each star",
    ", we compute the mean @xmath8 ( @xmath52 ) and its scatter @xmath53 , then exclude any values more than 3@xmath53 away from that mean and recalculate the mean and its uncertainty .",
    "summed over all stars and all trials , there are 125,100 periods which are shorter than the duration of observations , and a total of 110 @xmath8 values which were rejected by this 3@xmath53 clipping process .",
    "the discrepant @xmath8 values tend to occur at longer periods , especially those longer than the observations .",
    "the results are given in table  [ meankays ] for all eccentricities and recovery rates .",
    "there is a wide range of @xmath52 , spanning two orders of magnitude .",
    "this highlights the importance of considering the detection limits on a star - by - star basis .",
    "for example , hd  19632 , the star for which we obtained the worst detection limits ( @xmath54 ) , has a chromospheric activity index log @xmath55 @xcite of @xmath56 .",
    "this is one of the most active stars on the aaps target list ; `` quiet '' planet - search target stars typically have log @xmath57 .",
    "radial - velocity modulation due to starspots can produce such high levels of jitter @xcite , making the determination of meaningful limits extremely difficult .",
    "the velocity scatter for the 33 data points on hd  19632 is 26.2 , and the data show a strong periodicity near 6 days , consistent with its estimated rotation period of 12 days ( g.  henry , personal communication ) .    the detection limit achievable from a set of radial - velocity data depends largely on two factors : the number of data points , and their rms velocity scatter about the mean .",
    "using these results , we can determine an empirical relation between these quantities and the radial - velocity amplitude @xmath8 which can be detected .",
    "such a relation can then be used to estimate the amount of observing time required to obtain a robust detection ( or non - detection ) of a particular class of planet .",
    "figure  [ relation ] plots the mean @xmath8 obtained for each star ( @xmath12 , 99% recovery ) versus the quantity @xmath58 .",
    "the 119 stars for which @xmath59  were used in a linear fit , yielding the following relation :    @xmath60    using this fit , we can make estimates of the number of additional observations required to place robust constraints on planets in the aaps program . for example , a star with 40 observations at a total velocity rms of 3  would yield a detection limit of 5.8  , corresponding to 0.5  ( @xmath61 yr ) , and 0.1  ( @xmath62 d ) .",
    "it is important to note that the cadence of the observations can also have an impact on the types of planets which are or are not detectable .",
    "in particular , high - cadence observations are more effective at detecting short - period , low - amplitude planets , as discussed further in the next subsection .",
    "we note that recent modifications to the aaps observing strategy , such as 20-minute integrations to average over stellar oscillation noise , have resulted in velocity rms of 1 - 2  since 2005 for solar - type stars @xcite .",
    "the aaps plans to obtain a further 6 years of data applying these strategies , which should markedly improve the velocity rms achieved ( cf .",
    "table  [ rvdata1 ] ) , directly resulting in even tighter constraints on jupiter analogs .      of the 123 aaps program targets which ( 1 ) have more than 8 years of data , and ( 2 ) have more than 30 observations , 25 are known to host at least one planet ( plus one brown dwarf host : hd  164427 ) .",
    "the planetary parameters are listed in table  [ planets ] .",
    "a useful sanity check is to ask : `` do the detection - limit results indicate that we could have detected the ( known ) planet '' ? that is , we first removed the known planet s orbit , then added simulated planetary signals to estimate the detectability of a given signal .",
    "applying this method to the planet hosts , then , serves as a simple check of the degree to which this detection - limit method can be trusted . by comparing the velocity amplitude @xmath8 of the known planets in table  [ planets ] to the @xmath52 detectable for those stars ( table  [ meankays ] ) , we find that all but four of those planets pass this test at the 99% recovery level : @xmath63 .",
    "the four exceptions are : hd  4308b , hd  16417b , hd  23127b , and gj  832b . for hd  4308 and hd  16417 , this result",
    "is easily understood by referring to @xcite and @xcite . both of these low - amplitude , short - period planets were only detectable in aat data during 48-night continuous observing blocks , rather than the several preceding years of more widely - spaced observations .",
    "furthermore , these short - period ( @xmath64 days ) planets are wholly different from the jupiter analogs ( @xmath65 days ) which are the focus of this work . for gj  832 and hd  23127 ,",
    "we show the detection limit expressed in terms of @xmath8 as a function of orbital period in figure  [ getlucky ] . in each panel ,",
    "the known planet is plotted as a large point with error bars .",
    "we see that for gj  832 , the detection limit at the _ specific _ period of the planet is 99% , i.e.  the planet has a detectability of 99% , though the _ mean _ @xmath8 indicated a detectability of only @xmath1090% ( averaged over all periods ) .",
    "hence , these results are consistent with our robust detection of gj  832b @xcite . for hd  23127 ( right panel of figure  [ getlucky ] ) ,",
    "the planet lies on the 70% recovery contour ; this example illustrates that the automated criteria are more conservative than a human investigator @xcite .",
    "this characteristic of our simulations also applied to the 3 planets orbiting 61  vir @xcite , as detailed in @xcite .      in this work , we have adopted the definition of `` jupiter analog '' as a giant planet with a long period ( @xmath08 yr ) . by this definition ,",
    "the aaps sample includes 3 published jupiter analogs ( hd  134987c , gj  832b , and hd  160691c ) .",
    "so , to first order , we have a jupiter - analog frequency of @xmath66 .",
    "however , this simple calculation assumes that such planets are perfectly detectable for all stars in the sample , which is patently false .",
    "as we have computed circular - orbit detection limits at five recovery levels ( 99 , 90 , 70 , 50 , and 10% ) , we can use these results to apply a rudimentary correction for the relative detectabilities ( i.e.  the completeness ) for each star . @xcite detailed a similar technique to address the problem of incompleteness for the keck planet search data . here , we adopt a simple approach and define the survey completeness for a given radial - velocity amplitude @xmath8 and period @xmath43 as :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the recovery rate as a function of @xmath8 at period @xmath43 , and @xmath69 is the total number of stars in the sample ( @xmath24 ) . in this way",
    ", we account for the detectabilities for each star individually , at each of the 100 trial periods .",
    "we use the specific detection limit @xmath70 obtained for each period from the simulations described above , thus generating five pairs of ( @xmath70 , recovery fraction ) .",
    "then , we generate @xmath68 for each star by performing a linear interpolation between the five pairs of ( @xmath70 , recovery fraction ) . we can then estimate the recovery fraction @xmath68 for any @xmath43 and @xmath8 . as an example , suppose we choose @xmath71  and @xmath72 days",
    ". for hd  10700 , which is extremely stable and well - observed , and has very tight detection limits ( @xmath73 ) , a signal of 10  would always be detected , and hence @xmath74 for hd  10700 is 1.0 . for a star with poorer detection limits such as hd  109200 ( @xmath75 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath76 .",
    "we can see from these examples that if all stars in the sample were stable and well - observed ( i.e.  if selection effects , observing windows , and velocity jitter were unimportant ) , then every star would contribute 1.0 to the sum in equation  ( 2 ) , giving a survey completeness of 1.0 ( 100% ) .",
    "we could then obtain the planet frequency simply by dividing the number of detections by the total number of stars .",
    "however , these effects are extremely important for long - term radial - velocity surveys , and so we use equation  ( 2 ) to obtain a more realistic estimate of the completeness of our entire sample as a function of orbital period .",
    "those results are shown in figure  [ complete1 ] .",
    "we emphasize that we have _ not _ included unpublished planet candidates in our estimate of the frequency of jupiter analogs . in figure",
    "[ complete1 ] , we have summed over 101 stars , excluding 22 stars which exhibited an unusual artefact arising from the `` correct - period '' criterion discussed in section  3.2 . consider a data set in which an injected signal with @xmath77 days results in @xmath78 days being recovered by the periodogram .",
    "for a recovered signal to be accepted , it must be within 27.7% of the injected periodicity .",
    "so , for @xmath79d , @xmath78d is rejected , but at @xmath80d , @xmath78d is accepted .",
    "this resulted in signals which were `` undetectable '' even at large @xmath8 becoming eminently detectable once @xmath81 was within 27.7% of 5000d .",
    "the recovery fraction @xmath68 in equation  ( 2 ) can be used to derive a completeness correction for the published detections of jupiter analogs in the aaps sample . for each of the three stars which hosts a jupiter analog",
    ", we can compute @xmath68 at the specific values of @xmath43 and @xmath8 for that known planet .",
    "as we have computed detection limits for eccentricities of 0.0 , 0.1 , and 0.2 , we used the results from the eccentricity closest to that of each detected planet ( gj  832b : @xmath51 , hd  160691c : @xmath12 , hd  134987c : @xmath27 ) .",
    "this gives the following results : gj  832  0.983 ; hd  160691  1.000 ; hd  134987  1.000 .",
    "then , we compute the survey completeness @xmath82 to account for the detectability of these specific planets around the 120 remaining stars that do not host a jupiter analog . here , @xmath82 is computed at the specific values of @xmath43 and @xmath8 for each jupiter analog ; those results are then : gj  832  0.685 ; hd  160691  0.863 ; hd  134987  0.440 .",
    "the frequency of jupiter analogs based on this sample , corrected for completeness ( detectability ) , is then given by    @xmath83    here , @xmath84 total stars in the sample , @xmath85 which host a jupiter analog , and @xmath86 refers to the recovery fractions listed above .",
    "in addition , @xmath87 is summed over the 120 stars which did not host a jupiter analog , to account for how detectable the three found planets would have been around the remaining stars in the sample .",
    "we can also use the non - detections to compute an upper bound on the frequency of jupiter analogs in the aaps sample .",
    "using the recovery fraction @xmath68 determined as above for each star at every trial period , we compute the mean of @xmath68 over the period range 3000 - 5000 days .",
    "thus , each of the 120 stars which does _ not _ host a jupiter analog has a mean recovery fraction @xmath88 , with an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation in @xmath68 about that mean .",
    "an upper bound on the frequency of jupiter analogs can then be given by    @xmath89    where @xmath90 is the number of stars without a jupiter analog .",
    "the result is an upper bound on the frequency of such planets with @xmath8 greater than the selected value .",
    "those results are given in table  [ upperlimits ] .",
    "our upper bound of 37% for planets with @xmath91  and @xmath12 in the period range 3000 - 5000 days ( 3  au@xmath926  au ) is consistent with the core - accretion simulations of @xcite , in which 83/220 ( 37% ) of systems resulted in at least one planet matching these characteristics .",
    "however , our observed frequency of such planets in this sample , 3.3% , is significantly smaller .",
    "this difference arises from the simplifying assumptions in the @xcite simulations .",
    "first , each simulated system started with a disk mass of 1 minimum - mass solar nebula .",
    "a distribution of disk masses may better approximate the formation environments of real planetary systems ; liu et al .",
    "are performing further tests with this modification ( huigen liu , priv .  comm . ) .",
    "second , the simulations proceeded for @xmath93 yr ; it is possible that subsequent dynamical evolution such as planet - planet scattering events @xcite may eject planets in real systems , which would reduce the observed occurence rate .",
    "@xcite addressed the frequency of jupiter - like planets , defining `` jupiter - like '' as those planets with @xmath94 and @xmath95  au .",
    "based on the results of eight different doppler planet surveys , they estimated that 5@xmath112% of sun - like stars host jupiter - like planets .",
    "our estimate of 3.3% is consistent with theirs .",
    "we note that this work , unlike that of @xcite , is based on detailed simulations on a star - by - star basis .",
    "this approach , while computationally intensive , is critical for a proper characterisation of the selection effects present in radial - velocity data sets @xcite .",
    "the comprehensive study on detectabilities from the keck planet search given in @xcite focused on planets with periods less than 2000 days ( @xmath963  au for a 1  star ) .",
    "those authors then extrapolated the simulations results to @xmath13=20  au ( @xmath43=89 years ) . from their table  2 , which gives the giant planet ( @xmath970.3 ) occurrence rates for flat and power - law extrapolations , they estimated that 2.7@xmath110.8% of stars host planets between 36  au . in that range ,",
    "our measured occurrence rate is 3.3@xmath111.4% .",
    "our results are thus entirely consistent with those of @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have performed detailed star - by - star simulations on aaps data with a time coverage of 12 years , including the effects of eccentricity , in order to make a robust estimate of the frequency of jupiter analogs in the solar neighbourhood . based on our aaps sample",
    ", we calculate that no less than 3.3% and no more than 37.2% of stars host a gas giant planet in a circular orbit between 36  au .",
    "we have also performed a comprehensive analysis of the automated detection criteria employed in our simulation method .",
    "salient points arising from this work are ( 1 ) the uncertainty in the orbital period of a planet increaes dramatically when less than one cycle has been observed , ( 2 ) no planet has been published with less than 0.7 cycles of data , and ( 3 ) simulating a large number of planet detections reveals that for 99% of planets , the fractional uncertainty in period @xmath45 is 27.7% .",
    "this figure is useful for simulations in which one must determine whether an injected signal has been accurately redetected .",
