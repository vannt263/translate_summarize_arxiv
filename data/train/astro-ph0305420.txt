    "our solar system presents a unique local example of the interaction between a stellar wind and the interstellar medium . as the sun travels through the interstellar medium it is subject to an interstellar wind .",
    "three different discontinuities are formed due to the interaction between the supersonic solar wind flow and the interstellar wind : termination shock , heliopause and , in the case that interstellar wind is supersonic , a bow shock . at the termination shock , the supersonic solar wind passes to a subsonic regime .",
    "the heliopause is a tangential discontinuity that separates the charged components of the two winds . beyond the termination shock , the solar wind velocity is no longer constant , but decreases with radial distance until it reaches the heliopause .",
    "a bow shock may form in the interstellar wind since observations indicate that the solar system travels with a supersonic velocity of approximately @xmath0 @xcite . the complex system created by the interaction of the solar wind with the interstellar wind",
    "is known as the _ global heliosphere_.    in recent years , there has been increased interest in heliospheric studies in modeling the solar and interstellar interaction , in part due to the two successful voyager missions , launched in 1977 and in early 2003 , at @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "there is the expectation that in the near future the voyager spacecraft , traveling toward the heliopause , will cross the termination shock @xcite .",
    "accurate modeling of this region will allow us to interpret the data taken during the passage of voyager through ( and beyond ) the termination shock ( for a review on the subject see @xcite ) .",
    "recent works include elaborate computational models @xcite .",
    "nearly all the models , however , ignored magnetic field effects , especially the solar magnetic field .",
    "while the solar magnetic field does not play a major dynamic role in the interplanetary region @xcite , this is not true beyond the termination shock . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the interaction region between the solar wind and the interstellar medium , paying special attention to the region beyond the termination shock .",
    "the solar magnetic field , under quiet solar conditions , is approximately a dipole with opposite polarities in the north and south hemispheres .",
    "the supersonic solar wind pulls the solar field out into space creating a _",
    "heliospheric current sheet _ separating magnetic field regions of opposite polarities .",
    "the heliospheric current sheet corresponds to the region where the azimuthal field , @xmath3 . in the present study we neglect the tilt of the magnetic field axis with respect to the rotation axis",
    "therefore , near the sun the current sheet remains at the equatorial plane .",
    "an important question overlooked in previous studies was the fate of the current sheet beyond the termination shock .",
    "previous numerical studies by @xcite and @xcite , that used a 3d mhd simulation which included both the solar and interstellar magnetic field reported results indicating that the current sheet beyond the termination shock remains in the equatorial plane .",
    "these studies also neglected the tilt of the magnetic axis with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "the rotation of the sun coupled to a supersonic solar wind twists the interplanetary magnetic field lines such that the magnetic field , upstream of the termination shock ( toward the sun ) , takes the shape of an archimedian spiral ( known as the parker field ) @xcite . in analytic studies of the region beyond the termination shock",
    ", @xcite predicted the presence of _ magnetic ridges _ due to the compression of the azimuthal interplanetary field .",
    "their studies were made in the kinematic approximation where the magnetic field back reaction on the flow was neglected .",
    "the flow plasma @xmath4 ( ratio of solar wind ram to magnetic pressures ) decreases by a factor of @xmath5 near the stagnation point , indicating that a full mhd calculation in the region is necessary . since there is no natural symmetry in the system ,",
    "a 3d calculation is required .",
    "the enormous range of scales , from hundreds of @xmath6 to less than @xmath7 at the current sheet , requires a time - dependent adaptive grid code , making the calculation computationally very challenging .",
    "we used a full 3d mhd adaptive grid code , bats - r - us , developed at the university of michigan .",
    "this is a parallel multi - processor code that employs an upwind finite volume scheme based on an approximate riemann solver for mhd .",
    "the single fluid mhd equations are solved in a fully three - dimensional coupled manner .",
    "bats - r - us makes use of a block - based adaptive grid which allows the model to resolve structures of widely varying length scales ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the inner boundary of our calculation was placed at @xmath8 and the outer boundary was on a @xmath9 box .",
    "the grid is designed to resolve in detail the region between the termination shock and the heliopause , especially refining at the current sheet .",
    "we used 4.5 million cells ranging from scales of @xmath7 at the current sheet to @xmath10 at the outer boundary with 6 levels of refinement .",
    "the parameters of the solar wind at the inner boundary were : @xmath11 , @xmath12 and a magnetic field of @xmath13 at the equator .",
    "for the interstellar medium we used@xcite : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the solar wind velocity at the inner boundary was assumed to be isotropic , with @xmath17 . the magnetic field for the solar system at the inner boundary",
    "is taken to be a parker spiral ( with the polarity of the solar magnetic field corresponding to this field being anti - parallel to the axis of solar rotation ) . in order to eliminate the effect of reconnection at the heliopause in the present study",
    ", we did not include an interstellar magnetic field .",
    "only the ionized component was treated .",
    "figure 1 is a meridional cut ( _ x - z _ ) at @xmath18 years , showing the contours of the magnetic field .",
    "the calculation was initiated at @xmath19 when the interstellar wind reached the solar wind and the bow shock , heliopause and the termination shock have formed with the current sheet in the equatorial plane .",
    "the coordinate system is such that the interstellar wind is flowing from the negative _ x _ direction and the solar rotation axis is in the positive _ z _ direction .",
    "we observe at @xmath20 the presence of _ magnetic ridges _ ( red ) where the magnetic field increases to values of @xmath21 .    beyond the termination shock ( ts ) , we find that a `` jet - sheet '' forms . as the flow decelerates , beyond the ts , approaching the heliopause ( hp ) , it compresses the azimuthal magnetic field , producing the magnetic ridges . in the current - sheet region , due to the absence of an azimuthal magnetic component",
    ", there is no magnetic pressure to slow down the flow and the solar wind streams freely .",
    "this leads to the formation of a _ jet _ in the meridional plane and _ sheet _ in the equatorial plane . due to",
    "the shear between the flow in the `` jet - sheet '' and the flow in the surrounding medium , the `` jet - sheet '' ( and the current sheet ) becomes unstable .",
    "we are the first to report this phenomena .",
    "figure 2a is a meridional cut at @xmath18 years showing the velocity contours between ts and the hp .",
    "we can see the jet structure : in the equatorial region the wind velocity is much faster than the surrounding medium .",
    "the red contours with positive velocities @xmath22 indicate solar wind material that was pushed aside by the jet and is flowing towards the ts .",
    "this produces the turbulence shown in the black lines that follow the flow streamlines .",
    "it can be seen that at @xmath23 , the flow streams at the equator with a velocity @xmath24 while the surrounding medium flows with a velocity of @xmath25 .",
    "the flow in the current sheet at the ts is subject to the de laval nozzle effect @xcite . as the nozzle widens ( at @xmath26 ) the flow velocity increases , becoming supersonic , and then decreases approaching the hp . the sonic mach number @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the flow velocity and @xmath29 is the sound velocity , is 1.1 at @xmath30 decreasing to 0.2 at @xmath31 .",
    "fig 2c shows a line plot of the velocity in the equatorial plane at @xmath18 years .",
    "figure 3 shows the time evolution of the current sheet for nine different times . by @xmath32 ,",
    "the current sheet starts to bend to positive z s while the nose moves toward negative z. this bending increases the turbulence beneath the current sheet .",
    "the current sheet , after an initial bending to the south , reverses its direction and moves to the north . at later times , the hp is highly distorted as can be seen by the flow streamlines in figure 3 g .",
    "the flow in the hp is very complicated : more than one stagnation point occurs above the equator and the two fluids appear to intermix .",
    "figure 4 shows a 3d image of the magnetic field contours and lines at @xmath33 years .      due to",
    "the velocity shear between the `` jet - sheet '' and the surrounding medium , a kelvin - helmholtz - like ( kh ) instability develops .",
    "the kh growth rate , for an infinite thin layer , is@xcite @xmath34 ^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath35 is the velocity jump across the shear layer , @xmath36 is the alfvn speed , @xmath37 is the direction of the wavevector ( here @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 is the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "maximum growth occurs for @xmath40 , @xmath41 is defined as the distance between the maximum velocity and zero ( see figure 2b ) . for @xmath42 for example , at @xmath23 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . with these values",
    "the predicted kh growth rate is @xmath45 .",
    "the necessary condition for the kh instability is @xmath46 . at @xmath23 , @xmath47 for @xmath48",
    "so the instability can occur near ( and at ) the current sheet .",
    "measuring the displacement of the current sheet with respect to the equator , at @xmath23 , during the evolution of the instability , gives a linear growth rate of @xmath49 ( between @xmath50 years ) , comparable to the estimate for the kh instability in slab geometry .",
    "the wavelength of the perturbation @xmath51 , using @xmath40 is also consistent with our results .    to determine",
    "whether this instability was not observed in prior studies due to the coarseness of the grid , we made an identical calculation , using a less refined grid at the current sheet .",
    "for the coarse grid , the cell size at the current sheet was @xmath52 compared with the refined grid of @xmath53 .",
    "no instability was seen .",
    "the current sheet remained in the equator , consistent with the previous numerical calculations .",
    "( e.g,@xcite used a spherical grid with a resolution varying from @xmath54 to @xmath55 from the inner to the outer boundary ) . the line plot in figure 2b",
    "compares the velocity profiles for our coarse and the refined grid cases . for the coarse grid ,",
    "the velocity of the jet is four times wider ( @xmath56 half width ) and smaller by a factor of two .",
    "the linear kh growth rate @xmath57 and thus we expect a decrease of about a factor eight . the instability is apparently suppressed in the coarse grid case not only because the growth rate decreases but also because numerical dissipative effects wash it out",
    "in the present study , we have neglected the effect of the tilt in the solar dipole ( @xmath58 from the rotation axis ) , as in @xcite and the previous heliospheric studies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "time - dependent effects such as solar rotation ( 27 days ) can affect our results .",
    "due to the tilt between the magnetic and the solar rotation axis , the current sheet near the sun takes the shape of the  ballerina skirt \" and can change the region beyond the termination shock .",
    "we we plan to investigate how this affects the instability .",
    "past work has shown that the effect of the inclusion of the neutrals coupled to the plasma through charge exchange interactions has several effects such as diminishing the distances to the ts , hp , bs and affecting the heliospheric flow velocity .",
    "we intend to include self - consistently the neutrals to study their effect on the jet - sheet structure .",
    "the formation of an unstable jet - sheet at the edge of the solar system , can potentially affect , the entry of energetic particles and the intermixing of interstellar and stellar material .",
    "the interaction between stellar winds and the interstellar medium produces several detectable astrophysical structures .",
    "hydrogen walls have been observed in several nearby stars@xcite , including our own solar system@xcite .",
    "stellar wind bow shocks , have been observed on a wide variety of astrophysical scales , associated with pulsars@xcite , ob - runaway stars@xcite and neutron stars@xcite .",
    "we predict the formation of an unstable jet - sheet in other stellar systems , as well .",
    "the ingredients necessary are a magnetized fast rotating star , possessing a supersonic wind that moves with respect to the interstellar medium .",
    "the probable candidates are rotating o stars with hot winds having high velocity in respect to the interstellar wind .",
    "the strength of the `` jet - sheet '' instability is proportional to the shear velocity between the flow at the current sheet and in the surrounding medium that is being slowed by the magnetic ridges .",
    "the intensity of the magnetic ridges , depends on the magnetic field , the wind ram pressure and on the rotation rate of the star .",
    "therefore , we predict that the instability will be enhanced for fast rotating stars with strong magnetic fields .",
    "because the compression of the stellar azimuthal field is also dependent on the interstellar pressure , the instability will be further enhanced for fast moving stars relative to the interstellar medium .",
