    "the presence of disks around rotating stars has long been realized from observations , but has never been explained in a satisfactory way . particularly pronounced are the disks around the emission line be stars .",
    "these can be detected because of the strong double - peaked emission lines of , large ir continuum excesses , and intrinsic polarizations .",
    "because of these interesting and easily detectable properties , be stars and their disks have been intensively studied for many years ( see reviews in smith , henrichs , & fabregat ( 2000 ) and yudin ( 2001 ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , the origins of their high densities , angular momentum , spatial structure , and variability remain a major puzzle .",
    "in addition to the dense equatorial disks , it is well known that be stars have substantial winds , roughly isotropic , with typical @xmath3 and terminal velocities near @xmath4 ( marlborough & peters 1986 ; grady , bjorkman , & snow , 1987 ; prinja 1989 )    hot stars exhibit rotational line broadening indicative of surface equatorial rotation speeds which are high , but less than about 80 percent the centrifugal ( keplerian ) limit . thus rotation alone is not sufficient to centrifuge material off the equator to form a disk .",
    "owing to the high luminosity of the stars , wind material leaves the general stellar surface due to radiative forces on the line opacity .",
    "line - driving , however , only works well where the wind material is not too optically thick , and has a sufficient velocity gradient for the absorbing atomic lines to sweep through the stellar continuum spectrum .",
    "observational evidence suggests that be star equatorial disks are too dense and too slowly expanding for line driving alone to support them against gravity .",
    "one possible mechanism proposed to create disks is the wind compressed disk ( wcd ) model of bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1993 ) . in this , stellar wind matter accelerating out from an intermediate latitude on a rotating star has a trajectory orbital plane which crosses the equatorial plane .",
    "the continuous outflows of such matter from the upper and lower hemispheres ` collide ' in the equatorial plane and form a compressed disk with density enhancement by a factor of @xmath5 , which is on the low side for what is needed observationally .",
    "irrespective of other theoretical issues raised concerning the wcd model ( owocki , cranmer , & gayley 1996 ) , the fact is that all the observational indications seem to point toward a disk which is mainly moving azimuthally , supported against gravity by centrifugal forces , i.e. ,  a near keplerian disk @xmath6 rather than one which is mainly outflowing @xmath7 .",
    "the near keplerian and high density disk inferred from observations poses questions which we address in this paper : how does the material acquire more angular momentum than it possessed when it left the stellar surface ?",
    "how does such an equatorial disk accumulate material , given that its density and small radial velocity gradient prohibit radiative driving from overcoming gravity in the equatorial plane ? proposed answers to these two questions have included schemes in which matter is ejected from the star selectively in the pro - grade direction to boost its rotation up to orbital values . in particular ,",
    "hanuschik ( 1999 ) considered how an outflow of particles with an isotropic maxwellian distribution could create an orbital regime comprising the faster pro - grade particles with the rest falling back .",
    "owocki & cranmer ( 2001 ) proposed non - radial pulsations with an anisotropic radiation force favoring pro - grade gas flow . while these ideas are interesting , the direct centrifuging action that a strong enough stellar magnetic field could provide seems to be a more direct way of producing the disk .",
    "the possible role of magnetic fields in be disk production has been mentioned quite often ( friend & macgregor 1984 ; poe & friend 1986 ; ignace , cassinelli , & bjorkman 1996 ) .",
    "these dealt with applications of magnetic rotator wind theory , which explored the various degrees of control of the outflowing gas by the magnetic fields ( belcher & macgregor 1976 ; hartmann & macgregor 1982 ; poe , friend & cassinelli , 1989 ; mestel 1990 ) .",
    "the magnetic rotator models considered the effects of the field on the azimuthal motion of the gas , the terminal speed of the wind , and the equatorial mass loss rate .",
    "several papers have discussed aspects of the time - dependent accumulation of stellar wind matter channeled by strong magnetic fields .",
    "this has been mainly in the context of early type chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars with very strong magnetic fields ( havnes & goertz 1984 ; babel & montmerle 1997a ) , but with ideas being extended recently toward applications to other hot stars and be star phenomena ( babel & montmerle 1997b ; donati 2001 ) .",
    "specifically , havnes and goertz ( 1984 ) discussed the effect of the growing ` magneto - spheric ' density and mechanisms which might disrupt the field , releasing energy and producing x - rays .",
    "babel and montmerle ( 1997a ) applied these ideas to develop a magnetically confined wind - shocked model for x - rays from the ap star iq aur and extended this ( babel and montmerle , 1997b ) to the young star @xmath8 ori c. donati  ( 2001 ) applied the model to @xmath9 cep which has a magnetic field much lower than those on cp stars , and which , they concluded , is highly oblique to the axis of slow rotation of this star .",
    "all of these papers , however , neglected the contribution of rotation to the dynamics of the magnetically channeled wind",
    ". this approximation can not be valid for stars of near critical rotation since the rotational energy density of the channeled wind , and even more so of the shock compressed disk , may far exceed the outflow energy density .",
    "nor can it say anything about how disk material acquires the quasi - keplerian angular momentum values observed . in this paper",
    "we therefore review the problems and address the other limiting regime where the rotational term is dominant ( centrifugal force balancing gravity ) .",
    "we do so to evaluate what field is necessary to provide sufficient torquing to produce a dense disk with quasi - keplerian speeds .",
    "we make use of the fact that near main - sequence b stars have a mass outflow and the channeling of that flow can lead to shock compressed disk material .",
    "the relatively high densities in that disk lead to the strong , excess free - free fluxes and electron scattering polarization for which be stars are known .",
    "we develop equations to find the field needed both to transfer angular momentum to material that is driven up from the star by line driven wind forces , and to redirect that flow toward the equatorial plane .",
    "this regime of a magnetically directed flow is non - spherical and , because there is a build up of matter , is also non - steady .",
    "the directed flow results in the formation of a disk - like structure the azimuthal motion of which is ` quasi - keplerian ' . by this",
    "we mean that the velocity distribution is not strictly keplerian but the motion is primarily azimuthal and with speeds of order the keplerian value .",
    "we have chosen to use an aligned field of dipole - like shape for the basic magnetic topology , @xmath10 , with the @xmath11-dependence parameterized . as for the gas , it will for the most part",
    "be assumed to be confined by the field .",
    "our main interest is not in the flow trajectories @xmath12 , but rather in the azimuthal velocity , ( ) , in the equatorial plane at radial distance , .",
    "the closed field will channel the gas to a specific radial distance , @xmath13 , that depends on the latitude  the field tube had at the stellar surface , the larger  corresponding to larger .",
    "field lines from high latitudes , @xmath14 , near the pole , would intercept the equator at very large distances , but before reaching those distances the wind energy density will exceed that of the field and no longer be magnetically dominated , since even a dipole field declines as @xmath15 .",
    "thus , there will be a broad , open , polar wind that fills the envelope volume far beyond the disk and above the closed lines of force that are channeling lower latitude material toward the disk . for our study",
    ", we consider both the strictly closed field regions and the transition to the open ones as illustrated in figure  [ fig : structure ] .",
    "the simplest picture of the situation would be an abrupt `` switch '' model , in which the field is assumed to be fully capable of causing solid body rotation , @xmath16 , out to an  distance , at which the field energy density has decreased to that in the gas flow . beyond that transition radius",
    "the gas would be dominant and in particular its angular velocity would satisfy conservation of angular momentum , @xmath17 . in this representation , there is a discontinuous shift in ( ) ( from @xmath18 to @xmath19 ) .",
    "although this picture may be useful for understanding some basic concepts involved in the torquing of disks , we know from magnetic rotator stellar wind theory that no such abrupt shift occurs at the  point in either  or the angular momentum .    to allow for a more realistic behavior of the angular speed and angular momentum transfer , we introduce a `` smooth transition '' model , in which a continuous parametric function , @xmath20 is specified for the angular velocity as a function of distance in the equatorial plane",
    "this function reaches a maximum , but the angular momentum continues to increase with increasing radius by a factor of about two , transmitted by the bent field lines .",
    "we are interested in cases in which @xmath20 reaches at least to the keplerian speed @xmath21 .",
    "the field lines will not be considered drawn open until at least a distance , , where the keplerian ratio , i.e. @xmath22 is at its maximal value .",
    "the maximal keplerian ratio radius is identified with the  radius and , from that radius outward , we assume that the gas motion then tends to the field - free flow limit .",
    "thus , at large @xmath23 , it obeys conservation of angular momentum , and the particles remain in their orbital planes defined at the point where they became free from the magnetic field forces .",
    "the subsequent flow trajectories in the far field region become similar to those in wind compression theory , either in the form of the wcd model or the wind compressed zone ( wcz ) model of ignace , cassinelli , & bjorkman ( 1996 ) .",
    "the wcz model was developed to describe the structure of a wind which has a rotation that is too slow to form a shock compressed disk , but nonetheless can produce density enhancements in the low latitude regions .",
    "the enhancements in density ( by a factor of 10 or so ) have an effect on the observational properties of a wide range of stars .",
    "the field lines are drawn out in the far field regime as described by ignace , cassinelli , & bjorkman ( 1998 ) .",
    "neither the wcd nor the wcz models can explain the quasi - keplerian disks of be stars .",
    "the relation to wcd theory of the current model for a shock compressed disk is as follows .",
    "the wcd model is `` kinematic '' in that the _ radial velocity structure _ of the outflow is chosen to obey the well - known beta law distribution , instead of being computed from the force of radiation on line opacities . in wcd theory , the velocity component  is assumed to be determined by conservation of angular momentum , and thus  decreases rapidly with radius and does not attain the quasi - keplerian angular speeds inferred from observations . in the current paper , we again use a kinematic approach , but now specify an _ azimuthal velocity structure _",
    ", @xmath20 , that assures quasi - keplerian velocities are reached for a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "this kinematic approach allows us to derive constraints on the surface field , , and the surface spin rate parameter , , that are needed for a disk to form .",
    "mass and magnetic flux conservation requirements provide information regarding the disk density distribution , the radial extent , and the timescale for variability . where needed",
    "we also use the wind beta velocity law to provide an estimate of the flow velocities driven by the star s radiation field . the derived structure for stars with `` torqued disks ''",
    "allows us to estimate observational properties such as  line strengths , intrinsic polarizations , and continuum fluxes at a variety of wavelengths useful for comparisons of the model with observations .",
    "a major goal is to derive lower limits on the field strengths required for the existence of centrifugally - supported disks produced by an aligned dipole - like field on a be star . as a first rough estimate , showing that the fields required to channel a flow are not unreasonable , we consider magnetic rotator wind theory . in that theory , as explained in ch 9 in lamers & cassinelli ( 1999 ) ( hereafter l&c ) , there is a `` primary mass loss mechanism '' ( in our case the line driven wind theory ) , which sets the stellar mass loss rate , and the terminal velocity .",
    "an amplification of both  and  can be produced by the co - rotating magnetic field .",
    "a transition occurs from the case in which the field acceleration effect is unimportant ( a `` slow magnetic rotator '' ) to the case in which the field produces a strong effect ( a `` fast magnetic rotator '' , or fmr ) .",
    "this transition occurs when the michel velocity , , ( which is very close to the terminal velocity in fmr theory ) is as large as the terminal velocity owing to the primary mass loss mechanism .",
    "the michel velocity is related to the poynting flux which makes the enhanced outflow energetically possible . as a starting point",
    ", we consider it reasonable to assume that the field necessary to dominate the flow and channel it to the equatorial disk should be at least comparable to the transition field strength from slow to fast magnetic rotator theory for a particular star .",
    "the michel velocity , , is given by quantities defined at the surface of the star ; the surface field , ( ) , rotation rate ( ) , and mass loss rate , . solving for  in the equation for  gives a minimal field based on fmr considerations .",
    "@xmath24    where @xmath25 is the stellar radius .",
    "we set @xmath26 equal to the surface equatorial speed @xmath27 , which is expressed as the equatorial keplerian speed , ( r ) times a fraction .",
    "we also set @xmath28 ( where  is the escape speed at the stellar surface ) . for numerical values",
    ", we express the velocity by the ratio @xmath29 ; the stellar mass and radius ratios by @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; and the mass loss rate by @xmath32 .    a roughly similar value for the magnetic field , as in equation  ( [ bfmr ] ) , follows from requiring that the energy density of the surface field @xmath33 should exceed that of the gas @xmath34",
    ". the derived field of order 10 gauss ( for @xmath35 ) is a very modest one .",
    "however , as we shall see , it is a lower bound on  because it effectively uses the density in the wind , which is much below (  @xmath36@xmath37 ) the densities that are produced in the centrifugally supported disk , so that the field ( @xmath38 ) torquing the disk is 30 to 100 times larger than that in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "let us start by considering the case of a non - rotating star with a strong surface magnetic field , which we take to be of dipole - like form ( but of more a general @xmath11-dependence ) , and with a uniform wind mass flux , @xmath39 , from its surface .",
    "if we consider starting from a vacuum environment and initiate an outflow , gas will be channeled along the field lines ( assuming @xmath40 ) , and along with matter from the opposite hemisphere , tend to fill the flux tubes to ever greater distances with wind compressed gas , creating an extended dense disk .",
    "this is the non - rotating case considered by babel & montmerle ( 1997a ) .",
    "the flux tubes would fill toward pressure balance .",
    "however , the resulting decrease in the velocity gradient would probably quench radiative driving , tending to cause the matter to fall back , although babel & montmerle ( 1997a ) suggest otherwise .",
    "we suspect that the rayleigh taylor instability might be important and prevent a wind flow from supporting a relatively dense envelope against gravity .",
    "when we introduce rotation , the magnetic field exerts an azimuthal force on the gas as well as acting to constrain its radial flow path to be along the flow tubes .",
    "as is illustrated in figure  [ fig : structure ] , the latitude  at which the flow originates will determine the azimuthal velocity of matter as it is channeled into the equatorial disk .",
    "matter originating in some latitude range @xmath41 will tend to reach the equator at @xmath42 with moderate speeds parallel to the field lines in the corotating frame . as a result of the influx of matter",
    ", there will be a build up of mass in these sectors of the disk .",
    "although compressed to high densities by the shock fronts of the incident flows , the material in the disk will be supported against infall mostly by centrifugal forces .",
    "we discuss below the parameters of the various resulting regions in the equatorial plane , and also the timescale on which they change .",
    "we find the latter to be long compared to typical rotation periods .",
    "so , for the purposes of this paper , we assume we have reached a nearly steady stage of moderately dense disk creation and consider the effect of stellar rotation .",
    "most of our interest is in the collision of winds in the equatorial plane , which involves material that is near and above the local keplerian speed .",
    "therefore , we find it convenient to express equations in terms of the dimensionless equatorial distance variable @xmath43 , and the variable @xmath44 , which is the ratio of the azimuthal speed to the local keplerian speed @xmath45 .",
    "a fundamental parameter for a specific star is the `` stellar spin rate parameter '' , which is the ratio @xmath46 of the stellar rotation speed to the keplerian velocity at the stellar equator ; thus = ( at @xmath47 ) . in principle ,  can have values in the range @xmath48 .",
    "however , for most be stars the range is @xmath49 .",
    "we assume for simplicity that the star is spherical and not distorted by the rotation .",
    "we begin by finding a form for @xmath20 that is consistent with known magnetically centrifuged wind systems and provides a kinematic distribution that we can use at all distances .",
    "although the topology of the field in the rotating dipole case is very different , there are properties of the azimuthal velocity that should carry over from magnetic rotator theory ( l&c chapter 9 ) . at small radii",
    ", the azimuthal speed behaves as in the solid body case , i.e. @xmath18 , while farther out it satisfies the conservation of angular momentum relation @xmath50 .",
    "now let us find a kinematic expression for , that is valid both near and far from the star and also provides a continuous form that asymptotically matches both behaviors .      at small distances from the star where the field is strong",
    ", we expect the azimuthal speed of disk matter to be controlled by centrifuging , i.e. , to follow the co - rotation distribution @xmath52    farther out , the angular velocity in the region well beyond the  distance should follow the conservation of angular momentum expression @xmath53 , where  is the maximum @xmath20 , which occurs at @xmath54 .",
    "we express  in terms of the dimensionless parameter , @xmath55 , where    @xmath56    and thus @xmath57 . at large @xmath58",
    "we will have @xmath59    at intermediate equatorial distances , the exact form of @xmath60 depends on details of how the field bends in reaction to the inertia of the matter .",
    "however , a reasonable form for @xmath60 parameterized by @xmath55 , and which has the limiting behaviors ( [ vphideqr ] ) and ( [ vphidra ] ) , is    @xmath61    where the numerator normalizes @xmath60 so that @xmath62 .",
    "this analytic form proves convenient for exploring the properties of the disk driving regime .",
    "although equation  ( [ vphi / v0 ] ) is purely empirical , it is designed to reflect the actual behavior of matter torqued in a magnetic field .",
    "figure  [ fig : vphivsx ] shows @xmath60 from equation  ( [ vphi / v0 ] ) for various @xmath55 values , as functions of @xmath58 .",
    "speeds are shown relative to @xmath27 , so the relative height of @xmath60 and @xmath45 depend on .",
    "while it is interesting to see the dependence of the adopted @xmath60 distribution on @xmath55 , we will see later that @xmath55 is not a fundamental stellar parameter comparable to the rotation quantity .",
    "in fact , for a star with a given  and , the location @xmath63 of the peak of the curve itself depends on  as well as on the field  at the surface of the star . only after we explore the consequences of assuming equation  ( [ vphi / v0 ] ) for @xmath60 , and particular forms for the disk field and density distributions , will we be able to identify the various independent stellar parameters for the be star disk problem .",
    "two other curves of interest are also shown in figure  [ fig : vphivsx ] : the keplerian circular velocity , @xmath45 and the escape speed @xmath64 , where    @xmath65    we need to compare the angular speed ,  with the local keplerian speed , so it is convenient to use the keplerian ratio ( @xmath44 ) introduced previously .",
    "using equation  ( [ vphi / v0 ] ) we get    @xmath66    this reaches a maximum at @xmath67 .",
    "figure  [ fig : svsx ] shows @xmath68 versus @xmath58 , for various  values . of particular interest is the value of  for which  just tangentially reaches unity ,  for which there is just a single point at which the angular speed reaches the keplerian speed .",
    "this `` threshold value '' of  is called `` '' , and it occurs at @xmath69 . for a given star ,  will determine the minimal magnetic field that is required to produce a torqued disk , i.e. one with material having angular velocities at least as large as keplerian speed .",
    "figures [ fig : vphivsx ] and [ fig : svsx ] reveal a number of regimes of behavior according to the value of @xmath55 ,    1 .   for the ` weak ' field regime ,",
    "curves of type @xmath70 , with ( @xmath71 ) never produce a @xmath60 value as high as @xmath72 at any @xmath58 , so @xmath73 at all @xmath58 .",
    "the centrifugal force supplied by magnetic torquing to material originating at any latitude is not able to overcome gravity .",
    "we assume that the matter will tend to fall back to the star unless supported by other forces such as radiation pressure or ram pressure of the inflowing accumulating gas .",
    "field lines will already be bent by the inertia of the gas at radial distances close to the stellar surface .",
    "2 .   for a `` moderate '' field regime ,",
    "for which @xmath74 ( depending on ) is of most interest in producing quasi - keplerian disks .",
    "the surface fields at intermediate  are strong enough to centrifuge gas to equal ( critical curve @xmath75 ) or exceed ( curves of type @xmath76 ) the keplerian circular speed @xmath45 .",
    "this range in @xmath55 will result in a quasi - keplerian disk over a range  to .",
    "the distance  is the first point at which the material has a speed greater than the keplerian speed , and we choose  to be the distance at which the keplerian ratio  is maximal and at which we can consider the field to lose its dominance over the gas flow .",
    "3 .   for the `` large '' magnetic field regime ( curves of type @xmath77 for which @xmath78 )",
    ", the magnetic torquing gives the matter sufficient @xmath79 alone to equal escape speed .",
    "however , the field could still dominate and prevent outflow . beyond some large distance",
    ", outflow is assumed to occur with little further increase in angular momentum and the angular velocity will vary as @xmath80 . arbitrarily large",
    "@xmath55 could centrifuge and contain a disk of arbitrary radial extent .",
    "however , @xmath55 depends on the surface field for which there are bounds as described by maheswaran & cassinelli ( 1988 , 1992 ) , so there are in fact upper bounds to @xmath81 as well .",
    "we should also emphasize that even though the curves of in figure  [ fig : vphivsx ] have the appearance of trajectories , they are _ not _ matter trajectories , but rather give the azimuthal velocities of matter which has arrived at a particular distance @xmath58 in the equatorial plane , having originated from latitude @xmath82 .",
    "here we derive expressions for the limiting radii of particular interest to the torqued disk problem .",
    "the innermost distance of interest , , is that at which the torqued matter first attains the local keplerian speed .",
    "it occurs where @xmath83 .",
    "so by equation  ( [ sksz ] ) ,  is the solution of    @xmath84    this non - linear equation can be solved by a newton iteration , which converges quickly when we start with the large @xmath81 solution to equation  ( [ xinvssz ] ) ,  @xmath85 .",
    "figure  [ fig : xthvssz ] shows @xmath86 versus @xmath55 for various , ( 0.5 , 0.7 , 0.9 ) .    the next distance of interest is where  peaks , namely @xmath87 , which we have already seen is given by    @xmath88    and at which the rotation speed ratio is @xmath89    to define an outer radius of the torqued disk we need a criterion to decide where the quasi - keplerian disk torquing effectively ceases . for this",
    "we adopt the distance at which the ratio @xmath68 maximizes ,  where @xmath90 , for a fixed @xmath55 . from differentiation of equation  ( [ sksz ] ) this is found to be    @xmath91    the value of  at  is given by    @xmath92    which for large @xmath55 varies as @xmath93 .",
    "thus , both the location and velocity at the peak increase roughly linearly with the parameter @xmath55 . note that although  is not explicitly dependent on , it depends on  through @xmath94 .",
    "a key issue is the minimum value of @xmath55 for which a keplerian regime exists at all .",
    "there is a single point at which the angular speed just reaches the keplerian speed . setting @xmath83 at @xmath95 in equation  ( [ sksz ] )",
    "gives    @xmath96    this minimal or `` threshold '' value of , produces a keplerian value of  at the singular distance @xmath97 . in figure",
    "[ fig : alpthsz ] we show the numerical solution for ( ) obtained from equation  ( [ alphath ] ) .",
    "this equation shows that  will be less than 1 for values of  larger than @xmath98 ( also shown in figure  [ fig : alpthsz ] ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that at very large spin rates the star will be substantially non - spherical and our whole treatment becomes rather approximate .",
    "our results should be regarded as most reliable for values of  that are less than 0.9 .",
    "we observe from figure  [ fig : alpthsz ] that for the  range most relevant to be stars , an excellent fit to the solution is    @xmath99    shown as the dashed line in figure  [ fig : alpthsz ] .    to relate @xmath81 to absolute scales of @xmath100 , and",
    ", we will adopt @xmath101 as the point where @xmath102 ,  we take to be the  distance . therefore",
    ", our definition of the  distance leads to the relation    @xmath103    thus , the  distance is the outer boundary of our torqued disk .",
    "we recognize that there is a degree of arbitrariness with this definition of the  distance .",
    "however , just as we were guided by wind theory in our choice of the kinematic expression for the angular velocity , we can also get some insight from magnetic rotator winds regarding an appropriate definition of the  radius . in the case of winds the  radius",
    "does not correspond to the peak of the @xmath60 distribution , but as seen in l&c , fig 9.3 , occurs farther out because the field continues to contribute to the speed of the gas .",
    "the peak of our  curve ( at @xmath67 ) clearly lies farther out than the maximum in the  curve ( at @xmath104 ) .",
    "it corresponds to an extremum in the torquing of the disks , in that no further increase in the keplerian ratio occurs .",
    "however , perhaps the best reasons for choosing the maximum in  to be the outer boundary of a disk are seen by considering the threshold case in which the  curve just tangentially reaches unity , which occurs for @xmath105 and at the location , . by definition of `` a threshold distance '' we would want the inner and outer boundaries to coincide , and the condition @xmath106 occurs at .",
    "the tangentially keplerian point is also an important location because the components of the total velocity ( @xmath107 , @xmath108,@xmath109 ) are fully definable for the first time at : the radial velocity , @xmath107 equals zero at the equatorial extremity of the dipolar field .",
    "the polar velocity @xmath110 is there nulled by the collision between the oppositely directed streams .",
    "the tangential velocity there is @xmath111 , so @xmath112 .",
    "furthermore , using shock conditions we will find the distance  to be the first radial distance in the equator for which our marginal model leads to a quasi - keplerian disk density ( ) .",
    "therefore , all the quantities needed for giving an equality between the total speed and an  speed , @xmath113 , are definable at .",
    "thus we will be able to use the conditions at  to define a threshold surface field  required to produce a torqued disk .",
    "choosing the peak of  to define the outer boundary of the torqued disk and also the  radius will allow us to predict the dependence of observational fluxes on field strengths and intrinsic stellar properties .",
    "we will then be able to test the resulting models against general be and hot - star observational requirements .",
    "we assume that , beyond (= ) , the gas flow will tend to draw the field outward and change from being predominantly an azimuthal flow to dominantly an outflow in the form of field - free wcd or wcz trajectories .",
    "the flow will make the transition to a nearly radial wind as the latitude of the point of origin increases .",
    "for @xmath114 , the ` keplerian disk ' regime extends from @xmath115 ( equation  [ xinvssz ] ) to @xmath116 ( equation  [ xouter ] ) . beyond the distance @xmath117 , the flow is no longer controlled by the field and there is a transition from a quasi keplerian to an outflow dominated velocity structure .    to get numerical values for these various boundaries in @xmath58 , we need to specify how the magnitude of @xmath118 , and @xmath119 vary with distance , for a given value of .",
    "since @xmath55 depends on , as well as on @xmath120 and @xmath121 , we specify all of these quantities in section [ bdrhod ] . to get a rough idea at present of the expected disk extent",

    ", we find the range of the quasi - keplerian disk to be @xmath123 ; a plausible range for be star disks .",
    "we choose to represent the field in the system as having a topology similar to the dipole limit , but to allow for greater generality we use a parameterized rate of decline with distance .",
    "specifically we set    @xmath126    where @xmath127 is the value at the stellar surface .",
    "in fact , the disk does not extend down to @xmath47 but only to @xmath128 . beyond @xmath129",
    "the field lines tend to stretch and break open and we do not attempt to describe this here as it is not inside the torqued disk regime . as we will show , the field within the disk determines its radial extent .",
    "we also need to know the shape of the field lines in the region out of the equatorial plane .",
    "this is because it is the frozen - in _ tube geometry _ between the footprint of the field at stellar latitude @xmath130 , and the point @xmath131 where the field crosses the disk which determines the _ flow geometry _ (  area of the tubes ) through which the wind mass flux is channeled .    to get the tube geometry",
    ", we make the simplifying approximation that the field strength ( and also the wind mass flux ) is uniform over the surface of the star ,  is assumed to be the field at all @xmath130 , and the field lines are normal to the stellar surface . these assumptions _  _ as well as constant radial  and constant mass flux _ - _ will not be strictly true in a rapidly rotating star , but they should be adequate to describe the limited range of latitudes @xmath130 that adds matter to the range  to  in the disk .    with these assumptions regarding the field geometry , the outgoing cross - section of a flux tube of area  at the stellar surface has a value @xmath75 at @xmath23 in the equatorial plane determined by field line conservation to be    @xmath132    where we have used equation  ( [ bbdex ] ) for the ratio of the fields at the base and at the point of intersection with the disk .",
    "we assume that the density is determined by pressure balance in the post shock region where the flows from the upper and lower hemispheres collide .",
    "thus , the density near the equatorial plane is determined in much the same way as in bjorkman & cassinelli ( 1993 ) , but the material is not flowing outward , in contrast with the wcd model . also , since the material has an angular velocity at or above the keplerian speed , it is supported against gravity by centrifugal forces .",
    "thus the dynamic pressure does not also need to support the gas against gravity , which is the case for the models of the slowly rotating chemically peculiar stars ( babel & montmerle 1997a ) .",
    "the opposing wind streams provide a ram pressure that must be balanced by the static gas pressure in the shock compressed region .",
    "the density in the shock compressed disk can be significantly larger than that in the incident winds , especially in the near - equator zone where the shocked gas has cooled radiatively .",
    "we can assume the equatorial disk region to be cool ( @xmath134 k ) because such a temperature can be maintained from a radiative equilibrium balance with the incident stellar radiation field .",
    "that is , the density is sufficiently high that radiative cooling is effective and sufficient to balance the heating by the stellar light . for a be star , the appropriate temperature range is from 1  to @xmath135 , and with the corresponding sound speed @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the mean particle mass .",
    "we find by equating the disk gas pressure to the wind ram pressure that ,    @xmath138    where  and  are the density and velocity of the flow at the equatorial end of the magnetic tube , and @xmath139 is the mass flux there .",
    "we use the subscript , @xmath140 ( for wind ) , on both the incident velocity and density .",
    "we assume that the radiation forces drive a field - channeled flow with a parallel velocity , @xmath141 which is comparable to the wind speed that could have been reached at a radial distance @xmath23 in the line driven wind of a non - magnetic b - star .",
    "we take this to be given by the beta law expression    @xmath142    the mass loss rate of the b - star sets the surface mass flux scale , and as stated above it is sufficient for our purposes to assume the mass flux rate @xmath143 is the same at all latitudes on the star .",
    "the mass flux at @xmath58 is related to the mass flux entering at the star via @xmath144 , where @xmath75 is the area perpendicular to the flux tubes , as given in ( [ tubea ] ) .",
    "thus we obtain ,    @xmath145    using equations  ( [ betalaw ] ) and  ( [ fmx ] ) , the disk density at the equator is given by the pressure balance equation ( [ rampressure ] ) , thus    @xmath146    where we let @xmath147 be a characteristic stellar mass loss density , and @xmath148 be the characteristic density in the disk .",
    "the corresponding number densities are given by @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "from differentiation of equation  ( [ rhoin ] ) , we find that the disk density peaks at @xmath151 which lies close to ,    @xmath152    the disk density in equation ( [ rhoinval ] ) is nearly 4 orders of magnitude larger than that in the `` wind '' incident on the disk    @xmath153    thus the two adjacent densities ( post- and pre - shock ) given by equations ( [ rhoinval ] ) and ( [ rhowind ] ) respectively , differ by about a characteristic mach number squared @xmath154 , as is typically the case for isothermal shocks . in the case of early - type stars such as the be stars ,",
    "the mach number factor is quite large .",
    "finally , the large density contrast between the region in and out of the shocked disk justifies the neglect of gas pressure compared with the centrifugal support , as assumed in our model .",
    "we now have explicit parameterizations of the disk field , @xmath118 ( equation  [ bbdex ] ) , density @xmath155 ( equation  [ rhoin ] ) , and azimuthal velocity ( equation  [ vphi / v0 ] ) as functions of @xmath58 .",

    "it is easy to confirm that equations  ( [ bbdex ] ) ,  ( [ rhoin ] ) , and  ( [ vphi / v0 ] ) satisfy this monotonic decline in energy density ratio .    to express @xmath81 explicitly in terms of the physical parameters of the star , we use the fact that at the rotational  point , ( =) ,    @xmath158    which , on using equations  ( [ bbdex ] ,  [ rhoin ] , and  [ vphi / v0 ] ) implies that    @xmath159    using @xmath160 ( equation  ( [ xadef ] ) ) , and substituting this in equation  ( [ xabigequ ] ) gives us    @xmath161    where we use the definition    @xmath162    equation  ( [ xabdef ] ) is our basic equation for relating , the fundamental quantity in our kinematic model , to the stellar field and basic stellar properties contained in @xmath163 . in figure",

    "if the field drops off more rapidly with distance from the star , a significantly larger surface field is required to produce the disk .",
    "primarily this is because the inner boundary , which is identical to  for , is not at the stellar surface but at 2.43 r , so for the larger values of @xmath165 , a larger surface field is needed to give the same field at .",
    "the effect of changing the wind velocity law index is shown by the curves labeled with various values of @xmath9 in figure  [ fig : bthsz ] , and these indicate that the steepness of the wind velocity law is also of some importance in determining the field strengths required to produce a disk .",

    "the latter bounds were derived from considerations of envelope circulation currents and maximal contributions of field pressure to hydrostatic support .",
    "we can see in figure  [ fig : mahesthsz ] that very large magnetic fields are required to produce disks around o stars .",
    "such large fields are needed because the large wind momenta ( ) of o - star require large magnetic forces to deflect their flows . for the case of the o3 v star the required field lies above the maximal allowed field for many different stellar spin rates . for the early b stars with a spin rate of @xmath191",
    "the field required is in the range 100 to 1000 gauss .",
    "such fields are small enough to have avoided detection in the past , but are near the field strength recently found by donati  ( 2001 ) in @xmath9 cep . for the late b stars ,",
    "we see that because of their small wind momentum rates , rather weak dipole fields of order 30 gauss could produce a torqued disk .",
    "in such cases we need to know if the predicted disks would be detectable .",
    "the properties of the stars in table 1 lead to specific predictions regarding the disk extent and observational diagnostics should vary with stellar parameters . in particular , for given values of @xmath192 , we expect the radial extent of the quasi - keplerian disk to increase with increased  while decreasing with increased , predictions that might be observationally testable .",
    "we now investigate the radial extent of disks as function of stellar magnetic field , and find the number of particles in the disk to find if the model can explain the polarimetric properties and disk emission measures , which determine the  fluxes , of be stars .",

    "note in figure  [ fig : xradvsb ] that , for values of  large enough to enforce nearly solid body rotation , the location of the inner boundary is nearly independent of the magnetic field , as it is primarily set by the value of  as mentioned earlier . in regards to the outer boundary , an expression for @xmath204 can be derived from the ratio of two values of @xmath205 in equation  ( [ gamdef ] ) , evaluated at @xmath206 and at @xmath207 , and we find that the outer radius varies with @xmath204 , roughly as @xmath208 .",
    "the net effect is that the outer boundary and the extent of the disk increases as  increases , but the location of the inner boundary does not change much .    from an observational point of view these considerations only concern the magnetically torqued regions while the flow in the far regions could also show enhanced densities because of the wcd effects as schematically illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the typical range of the disk model boundaries here is of the same order with @xmath209 to 10 , as discussed in the empirical models of be stars assuming keplerian disks and based on iras observations ( waters 1986 ) , and  line observations by cot , waters , & marlborough ( 1996 ) . as the latter authors note , the observations do not rule out disks of greater radial extent , since the tenuous outer parts contribute little to the polarization or emission measure . indeed some observations such as the radio observations of taylor  ( 1990 ) show that high density material can reach distances of order 100 @xmath25 .",
    "the bulk of this extent might be a tenuous outflow wcd / wcz region as opposed to a quasi - keplerian one .",

    "the magnetically torqued disk model predicts roughly the right emission line properties , although clearly a better treatment of the radiation transfer is required . also the be phenomenon extends to late b stars ,",
    "so a reason for the wide range of spectral classes that contain be stars needs to be explored in the context of our model .",
    "we now consider the implications of this model for the qualitatively different phenomenon , the variability of the be stars on a variety of time scales .",
    "undoubtedly many of the chief clues to the dynamical structure of be star disks come from the complex time variability of these objects .",
    "be stars vary on a wide range of characteristic times from `` activity '' on scales of hours ( balona 2000 ) to quasi - periodic variability on years to decades ( doazan 1982 ) .",
    "also of interest is the phase transition time from non - emission line to emission line phases that indicate disks can vanish and re - appear on time intervals of hundreds of days , ( hubert - delplace  1982 and hubert 1981 ; dachs 1987 ) .",
    "the connection between our magnetically torqued disk ( mtd ) model and these time scales is discussed below in   [ sec : strength ] .",
    "in addition to changes in overall line strength , another interesting source of variability in these objects is the cyclic change in the strengths of the violet and red peaks of the  emission lines , known as v / r variation .",
    "this phenomenon comprises a shifting asymmetry of emission line peaks from @xmath233 to @xmath25 over a timescale of order a decade ( telting  1994 ; telting 2000 ) .",
    "ideas for understanding the @xmath265 variations within the context of the mtd model are discussed in   [ sec : vr ]      our interest has been in finding the field strength required to have matter transmitted from the star to the relatively dense disk inferred from observations .",
    "later we mention some ideas for modifying our basic model to produce a gas dominated disk that seems to be required for the one armed instability to operate .",
    "as can be seen in equation ( [ wlambda ] ) , we can attribute time variability of , to the time dependent increase in the height of the disk , @xmath266 , so we need an expression relating the time derivative @xmath267 to stellar parameters .",
    "we first note that the mass inside a disk area element @xmath268 at any time is @xmath269 .",
    "both @xmath270 and @xmath268 should not change appreciably in our rigid field model . if we equate the change in this mass to the mass influx from the magnetically channeled wind , we obtain    @xmath271    where @xmath272 and we get    @xmath273    let us consider the time for the star to change from the non emission phase to an emission phase be star . for this",
    "let us assume the lines are noticeable when the equivalent width is about 1  .",
    "therefore , setting @xmath274 in equation ( [ wlambda ] ) , we obtain from @xmath275 , the start - up time ,    @xmath276    for the values associated with a b2 star , and with @xmath277 this gives a reasonable value of about 4 months .",
    "for later type b stars , the value increases significantly ( 100 years in the case of a b5v stars and @xmath278 years at b9v ) .",
    "these long times for the late b stars is mostly because the mass loss rates we assumed for these stars are much lower , and hence @xmath279 in equation ( [ timeone ] ) is longer .",
    "although there is a known a tendency for later b stars to change on a slower time scale ( hubert - delplace 1981 ) , we suggest that a better agreement of our model with the observations of the late b stars would occur if we accounted for the extreme version of fmr theory that was called `` centrifugal magnetic rotator '' theory ( l & c ,  9.7.1 and figure 9.7 ) .",
    "in this class of magnetic rotator winds the mass loss rate is enhanced because the density scale height in the subsonic and solid body portion of the wind is increased by centrifugal forces and  increases exponentially with @xmath280 ( l & c , eq 9.90 ) .",
    "the late be stars appear to have a larger  on average than do the early be stars ( hubert - delplace  1981 ) , and would be the ones for which centrifugal magnetic rotator effects are likely to be important .",
    "if late be stars have mass loss rates in excess of those predicted by pure line driving , our estimate for the disk start - up timescale could be brought to an reasonable range .    in our model , the height of the disk would increase linearly with time , so a growth - time scale can be defined as @xmath281 . of particular interest in this regard is the fill - up time @xmath282 .",
    "this is the time it takes the incident mass flux to increase the height @xmath210 of disk matter in the tube to its maximal value which is about @xmath23 ( c.f .",
    "donati  2001 discussion ) . thus    @xmath283    made without considering detailed mechanisms , this estimate of the disk filling time is much longer than the wind flow time ( @xmath284 ) .",
    "the disk filling time is about four years in the inner disk ( @xmath285 ) , with the outer regions eventually filling in around a decade  tantalizingly close to the observed long term be star disk variability time scales .",
    "some discussion of specific field disruption mechanisms ( reconnection , diffusion ) by matter accumulation is to be found in havnes & goertz ( 1984 ) , babel & montmerle ( 1997a ) , and donati  ( 2001 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the @xmath265 variations proposed by papaloizou ( 1992 ) and okazaki ( 1991 ) is that the variation is due to the very slow rotation / precession of an azimuthally localized density enhancement in the disk across the line of sight from the approaching to the receding part of the disk .",
    "the physical model proposed for such a density enhancement and drift is that it is a density wave in the disk , somewhat like galactic spiral density waves , but attributable to the gravitational field of the non - spherical central star , rather than to self - gravitation ( negligible in a stellar disk ) .",
    "this model is attractive in predicting a density spiral precession period of the right order for typical keplerian speeds .",
    "the mtd model discussed here shares some important features with the models of precessing one - armed spirals .",
    "most importantly , both models envision a disk in which material spends a long time in roughly keplerian motion ( in fact , the observations of @xmath265 variations are often cited as evidence of the existence of a near - keplerian disk ) .    the v / r variability on irregular time scales of average 7 years ( okazaki 1997 ) has been explained as the orbital motion of a one armed spiral pattern in a disk .",
    "a model by lee , saio , & osaki ( 1991 ) has proposed that the matter is driven up from the star by viscosity .",
    "a one armed pattern in the disk has been explained by the global disk oscillation model of okazaki ( 1991 , 1996 ) and papaloizou ( 1992 ) .",
    "the gdo model would operate in quasi - keplerian disks but not in disks in which the material has a short residence time .",
    "matter must be supplied to the disk either continually or by events such as non - radial pulsations that occur on a time scale shorter than the viscous time scale as considered by owocki & cranmer ( 2001 ) .",
    "the v / r phenomenon is one that all models must try to address . in our magnetic channeling / torquing model , for strong fields a substantial part of the disk would have corotating @xmath286 values and one might expect the field torquing forces to overwhelm any gravitational density wave effect , though in the outer disk where the field will bend ( attaining a @xmath287 component ) there might be some such effect .",
    "any concentration of disk density by a stellar surface field that is not uniform in @xmath287 would be expected roughly to corotate with the star , rather than over long periods .",
    "this is therefore an intriguing open question for future consideration .",
    "a very interesting idea , proposed by h. henrichs ( 2002 , private communication ) , is that the stellar field might be time variable . during periods",
    "when it is strong our model would apply and a dense disk would build up over the fill time we estimated .",
    "however as it stands the model provides no obvious way to explain @xmath265 variations , at least via density wave precession in a keplerian disk controlled by the gravity of the non - spherical star .",
    "if , however , the field weakened substantially then the disk would decouple from the field and become near keplerian through viscous effects and capable of supporting such density waves until the field returned or the disk decayed - another observed phenomenon the timescale of which requires explanation .",
    "this idea makes the testable prediction that @xmath265 variations should be absent during disk build up and present only at times of weak field .",
    "the central point of our model is that magnetic torquing and channeling of wind flow from the intermediate latitudes on a b star can , for plausible field strengths , create a dense disk a few stellar radii in extent in which the velocity is azimuthal and of order the local keplerian speed .",
    "the model was motivated by the fact that line profile data ( e.g. hanuschik 1996 ) indicate that disk emission lines of fe ii , extend to @xmath288 , and reach disk keplerian values .",
    "also the sharp absorption features seen in the center of those lines do not show evidence for inflow or outflow .",
    "the latter of course would be expected in the case of the wcd model .",
    "the present paper aimed to show that fields could confine and torque the flow to create a quasi - keplerian disk of roughly the spatial extent suggested by these observations .",
    "future work to test the real viability of the model will address two important questions :    1 .",
    "is the azimuthal velocity distribution @xmath20 across the radial range of the dense disk predicted by our magnetic model compatible with observed line profiles ?",
    "this model distribution starts as roughly corotational ,  @xmath16 , and transitions to a  decreasing with @xmath23 .",
    "this distribution is clearly not truly keplerian disk @xmath289 .",
    "however , the typical @xmath286 is comparable with @xmath72 and exists over only a rather narrow range of @xmath23 , unless the field is very strong , which is unlikely on theoretical grounds ( maheswaran & cassinelli 1988 , 1992 ; c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : mahesthsz ] ) . outside the model disk domain , at @xmath290 , we predict quantitatively a somewhat flattened wcd region changing with increasing @xmath23 to a wcz . at even farther distances from the star",
    ", the wind will be nearly spherical .",
    "all of these regions involve strong outflow velocities but with densities much below those in the quasi - keplerian disk .",
    "it is important to estimate whether the high @xmath107 but low density distributions there are compatible with line profile data  does there exist an outer expanding flattened disk which affects line profiles very little but is detectable by radio observations etc .",
    "these and other diagnostic predictions of the magnetically torqued disk model such as x - ray production will be treated in subsequent papers .",
    "another issue , that is perhaps related to the @xmath265 variations is the winding up of the field - something we have ignored so far . in a model with strictly corotational @xmath291 out to some point and angular momentum conservation beyond there , the field would corotate in the disk region . however , in practice and for our parametric model ( equation [ vphi / v0 ] ) , @xmath0 falls behind corotation and the field will be wound up .",
    "the resulting   component will have opposite sign on opposite sides of the disk plane and will grow until field reconnection can occur allowing a quasi - steady state with the disk matter slipping across the field lines .",
    "in such a situation gravitational control of the disk may dominate sufficiently for the disk to behave as quasi - keplerian and allow density waves .",
    "indeed , in the light of this , one might argue that our estimate of @xmath292 is too conservative since the crucial feature of our model is that the field should deliver wind matter to the disk with sufficient angular momentum ( from magnetic torquing ) and with essentially no @xmath107 but only @xmath108 so that shock compression can occur without any outflow ( in contrast to the wcd model ) .",
    "this needs working out in detail but if only the wind density needs torquing action our field limits would be much reduced . furthermore , in that case the disk @xmath293 would be so high compared to @xmath294 that the matter would completely dominate the field once delivered into the dense disk , which would consequently be essentially keplerian and so support density waves under the action of stellar gravity .    in this paper",
    "we have followed a used a kinematic description of the azimuthal velocity of a disk zone , along with constraints based on magnetic rotator theory to develop an analytic model which we call the magnetically torqued disk ( mtd ) model , we derived the independent parameters for disk formation problem : the spin rate parameter . , the surface field and the stellar parameters contained in the quantity , .",
    "we assumed a rather simple rigid magnetic field picture , but one that allowed us to derive an estimate of the field required to produce a torqued disk for main sequence stars ranging from o3 v to b9 v. although an unreasonably large field was found to be needed for the early o stars , we concluded that at the early b spectral class at which the be phenomena are most prominent , the model provided about the right observational properties , and for reasonable surface field strength .",
    "also , we considered several time scales associated with be stars , and found start - up , growth and fill - up time scales that are in the month to decade long range that seem appropriate .",
    "for the late b stars the start - up time scale and the  equivalent widths appear to be small and we suggest that perhaps the mass loss rates for these stars need to be enhanced by centrifugal magnetic rotator forces .",
    "modifications that are needed to address v / r variations and observational consequences at a variety of wavelengths will be considered in later papers .",
