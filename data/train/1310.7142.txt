    "recently , charged black hole with a scalar hair in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions studied in the ref . [ 1 ] and rotating hairy black hole in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions studied in the ref . [ 2 ] .",
    "the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional theories are toy models to investigate some fundamental ideas to understand higher dimensional theories because they are easy to study [ 3 ] . also , it is useful to study gauge / gravity dualities [ 4 - 7 ] .",
    "these kinds of black hole recover well known btz black hole in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions [ 8 - 12 ] .",
    "+ in this work we would like collect refs .",
    "[ 1 , 2 ] to construct rotating charged hairy black hole in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions . in that case",
    "we assume that the electric charge and rotational parameter are infinitesimal .",
    "+ then , the main goal of this paper is particle acceleration mechanism .",
    "it has been shown that free particles falling from rest at infinity outside a rotating black holes may collide with arbitrarily high center - of - mass ( cm ) energy and hence rotating black holes may be considered as a particle accelerator [ 13 , 14 ] .",
    "it is found that the cm energy of elastic and inelastic scattering of particles in the gravitational field of static and rotating kerr black holes is limited for the static and is unlimited for the rotating black holes [ 15 ] .",
    "several studies indicate that having infinite cm energy of colliding particles is a generic property of a rotating black holes [ 16 - 27 ] .",
    "now , we verify this general property for the rotating charged hairy black hole in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions . + in the next section we construct a black hole in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions include electric charge , scalar charge and rotational parameter , and then in section 3 we obtain field equations and discuss geometric properties of this black hole . in section 4",
    "we discuss about horizon structure of rotating charged hairy black hole and obtain event horizon for small radius limit . in section 5 we study particle acceleration and obtain cm energy of two colliding particles near the black hole . in section 6 we discuss about the effective potential , and finally in section 7 we summarized our results and give conclusion .",
    "we consider the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional gravity with a non - minimally coupled scalar field and self coupling potential @xmath0 , which is described by the following action , @xmath1},\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a coupling constant between gravity and the scalar field which will be fixed as @xmath3 .",
    "the proposed metric for this black hole is similar to the ref .",
    "[ 2 ] , @xmath4 under assumption of infinitesimal @xmath5 and @xmath6 we obtain , @xmath7 @xmath6 is the electric charge , @xmath5 is a rotation parameter and is related to the angular momentum of the solution and @xmath8 is related to the cosmological constant via @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is integration constants depends on the black hole charge and mass , @xmath11 and scalar charge @xmath12 related to the scalar field as , @xmath13 also one can obtain , @xmath14 and , @xmath15\\phi^{6 } + \\mathcal{o}(q^{2}a^{2}\\phi^{8}).\\ ] ] we can see that the first order of rotational parameter @xmath5 has no effect on potential .",
    "so , this potential studied completely in the ref . [ 1 ] .",
    "+ in the next section we write field equations and discuss geometric properties of solution briefly .",
    "one can obtain the following independent christophel symbols , @xmath16 where , @xmath17 these yield to the following ricci scalar , @xmath18 which is singular at @xmath19 , and yields to @xmath20 for @xmath21 and @xmath22 . the riemann and ricci tensors also are singular at @xmath19 for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "+ one of the non - vanishing components of cotton tensor obtained as the following , @xmath25 which tells that , at the non conformal limit , the metric is flat",
    ". therefore , the rotating charged hairy black holes are geometrically quite different from the case of the static uncharged btz black hole .",
    "in the refs . [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] horizon structure of hairy ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional black holes in several special cases such as uncharged , extremal rotating and non - extremal rotating black holes , and also under some constraint on the black hole parameters has been studied in details .",
    "now we would like to discuss a more general cases ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath26 ) without any conditions on the black hole parameters .",
    "just we take @xmath27 and assume @xmath28 as infinitesimal parameter ( @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) , therefore @xmath31 . under this assumption ,",
    "the relation ( 3 ) gives the following equation , @xmath32 the equation ( 12 ) has generally six solutions .",
    "two of them are imaginary and are not physically interesting cases .",
    "also two of them are negative and interpreted as naked singularities .",
    "two remaining solutions which are real positive are indeed inner and outer horizons . in order to find event horizon",
    "we decompose equation ( 12 ) as the following , @xmath33 where @xmath34 are imaginary , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are negative solutions .",
    "only physical solutions are @xmath37 and @xmath38 which will be interpreted as outer and inner horizons respectively and obtained as the following , @xmath39 and , @xmath40 it is clear that the @xmath41 is crucial condition .",
    "typical behavior of real solutions illustrated in the fig . 1 where @xmath42 denotes outer horizon .",
    "if we choose @xmath43 , then @xmath44 is event horizon .",
    "in order to obtain the cm energy , we should calculate the velocities of the particles , which will be obtained as the following , @xmath45 where @xmath46 denotes the test particle energy per unit mass and @xmath47 denotes the angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "we use velocity components ( 16 ) to obtain cm energy of the two - particle collision in the background rotating charged hairy ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional black hole .",
    "it is assumed that two particles have the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath48 and @xmath49 , energy per unit mass @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    ". moreover we take @xmath52 as the rest mass of both particles .",
    "then , by using the following relation , @xmath53 where @xmath54 , we can find the cm energy of two - particle collision as the following expression , @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and , @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "using relations ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) in the equation ( 18 ) we draw typical behavior of cm energy in the fig .",
    "2 which shows that near the black hole horizon the cm energy takes large value which is expected for the rotational black hole . also dotted line of the fig .",
    "2 , which is corresponding to static black hole ( @xmath22 ) shows that cm energy has finite value which is also expected .     in terms of @xmath59 by choosing @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "we fix black hole parameters as @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( solid line ) , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath66 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath22 ( dotted line ) . ]",
    "also we can obtain @xmath70 near the horizon analytically . in that case",
    "we should expand @xmath70 for @xmath71 to obtain , @xmath72 it yields to a critical angular momentum where cm energy will be infinite , @xmath73 it means that the particles with the critical angular momentum @xmath74 can collide with arbitrary high cm energy near the horizon .",
    "in the special case of vanishing scalar charge ( @xmath75 ) we can see that @xmath76 , which agrees with the results of [ 26 , 27 ] . in the fig .",
    "3 we draw critical angular momentum in terms of rotational parameter @xmath5 .     in terms of @xmath5 by choosing @xmath77 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath62 . ]",
    "the effective potential is given by the following relation , @xmath78 where @xmath79 obtained by using the relation ( 16 ) . in the fig .",
    "4 we draw effective potential ( 22 ) for various values of the black hole parameters . fig .",
    "4 ( a ) and ( b ) show that there is a critical radius @xmath80 so for the @xmath81 electric charge @xmath6 and scalar charge @xmath12 decreased the effective potential but for the @xmath82 the effective potential takes infinite value . indeed , this region is near the black hole horizon and infinite value of the energy is expectable . in the special case of @xmath83 variation of @xmath6 and @xmath12 have not any effects on the effective potential . in the fig .",
    "4 ( c ) we learn that the rotational parameter @xmath5 reduced the effective potential .",
    "+ the parameter @xmath84 is also useful for another reason .",
    "the particle with the critical angular momentum may have an orbit outside the outer horizon if , @xmath85 in the fig .",
    "5 we draw @xmath86 in terms of the black hole parameters . fig .",
    "5 ( a ) tells that for the case of @xmath66 and @xmath87 the electric charge restricted as @xmath88 .",
    "5 ( b ) tells that for the case of @xmath66 and @xmath64 the scalar charge restricted as @xmath89 .",
    "5 ( c ) tells that for the case of @xmath64 and @xmath87 the rotational parameter restricted as @xmath90 . in summary",
    "we conclude that the condition of having an orbit outside the outer horizon is choosing small @xmath5 and large @xmath6 with @xmath91 , which values of @xmath92 and @xmath93 are depend on values of @xmath6 and @xmath5 . in another word the electric charge increases @xmath86 but rotational parameter decreases @xmath86 , while scalar charge may increases or decreases @xmath86 .     for @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
