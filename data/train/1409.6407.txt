    "control over the dispersion of spp waves and their coupling to light are critical for this and other applications . while spp waves supported by the interface of a metal and a dielectric medium , both isotropic and homogeneous , are well known for several decades  @xcite , interest has arisen in the case of the partnering dielectric medium being periodically nonhomogeneous normal to the interface  @xcite , which allow the possibility of multiple spp waves that will enable extremely sensitive multi - analyte sensors  @xcite .",
    "an important aspect is the excitation of spp waves by incident light , which is usually mediated by a dielectric or a grating coupler  @xcite .",
    "coupling of light solely into spp waves propagating along a single direction is an important requirement in many instances , which can be achieved by arrangements such as oblique incidence on a grating  @xcite or by interference effects made possible by appropriately placed nanoscatterers  @xcite .",
    "slanted metal gratings were predicted to couple light preferentially into spp waves propagating in a specific direction  @xcite and slanted sinusoidal gratings and binary blazed plasmonic gratings have been similarly used  @xcite .",
    "control of propagation for applications such as subwavelength focusing of spp waves  @xcite requires not only anisotropic dielectric materials , but anisotropic metals as well .",
    "the ctf of a metal , deposited by an obliquely incident collimated metal vapor flux on a substrate @xcite , is highly anisotropic , as has been demonstrated for ctfs of plasmonic metals such as silver and gold  @xcite as well as magnetic materials like cobalt  @xcite .",
    "periodically patterned ctfs of inorganic dielectric materials such as caf@xmath0 were recently shown to function well as blazed diffraction gratings  @xcite .",

    "periodically patterned ctfs were fabricated by the deposition of a collimated flux of silver vapor directed obliquely towards 1-d gratings of photoresist ( ma - p 1205 , micro - resist technology ) in a vacuum chamber .",
    "several gratings were made by laser interference lithography using a he - cd laser ( 442  nm , 30  mw , kimmon , japan ) on glass substrates that had been first cleaned and then spin coated with a photoresist .",
    "atomic force microscopy ( xe70 , park systems , s. korea ) was used to determine the period @xmath8 as 480 , 580 , 680 , and 770  nm for different gratings .",
    "all gratings had an approximately 50 - 50 duty cycle and a depth modulation of 150  nm .",
    "silver vapor was directed at an angle @xmath9 with respect to the mean plane of the grating .",
    "when the collimated vapor flux thus arrives very obliquely at the photoresist grating , only the ridges are exposed to the vapor while the valleys are shadowed out .",
    "this results in the growth of silver columns only on the ridges .",
    "deposition took place on gratings with different periodicities simultaneously to ensure identical deposition conditions .",
    "the deposition rate was maintained at @xmath10    s@xmath11 with the help of a quartz crystal monitor .",
    "base pressure within the chamber was @xmath12 mbar , which rose to about @xmath13 mbar during deposition .",
    "ctfs of about 500-nm nominal thickness were grown in this manner .",
    "the pp - ctfs were imaged using field - effect scanning electron microscopy ( fesem ) ( bp 40 supra carl zeiss instruments )",
    ". a 5  nm layer of gold was deposited at normal incidence to reduce charging effects .",

    "neutral density filters are used to attenuate the beam to avoid saturation of the photodiode .",
    "angle - resolved transmittance spectra of the periodically patterned ctfs were determined using a collimated beam from a 100-w tungsten - halogen lamp and a fiber spectrometer ( usb4000 + , ocean optics ) with a resolution of 0.5  nm in the 450 - 1000  nm wavelength range .",

    "these statistics were obtained by averaging over 25 nanocolumns in each fesem image .",

    "[ fig_dispersions ] .",
    "given the large thickness of the silver ctf , spp waves localized at the ctf / photoresist interface will not be detuned due to scattering from the ctf / air interface and vice versa  @xcite . when @xmath14 satisfies the condition @xmath73 for resonant excitation of an spp wave , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 is either a positive or a negative integer , the incident light couples to the spp wave and there is a strong attenuation of the transmitted field .",

    "the simulations were performed using the finite - element method implemented with comsol multiphysics software ( version 3.5a , 3-dimensional harmonic propagation mode in rf module ) to validate the coupling of @xmath2-polarized light to spp waves even in the absence of surface roughness .",

    "the transmission through a periodic array of appropriately oriented silver ellipsoids revealed strong spectral minima that approximately coincide with the measured transmittance minima for all the grating periods @xmath8 considered for this paper .",
    "we show plots of the simulated transmittance spectra for @xmath105  nm in fig .",
    "[ transmission_spectra ] .",
    "the transmittance dips in the plots should correspond to coupling with spp waves .",

    "very significantly , large localized @xmath59 and @xmath106 are excited of similar magnitudes as @xmath108 .",
    "thus , it becomes clear that the scattered fields , particularly the large near - zone fields associated with plasmonic nanocolumns , do not preserve the polarization state due to the ellipsoidal cross sections of the columns and couple to the spp waves on the two interfaces .",
    "the locations of the measured transmittance minima arising due to coupling with spp waves are marked by arrows in fig .",
    "[ transmission_spectra ] .",
    "the measured and simulated transmittance minima agree well .",
    "the simulations clearly reveal that the coupling of the @xmath2-polarized light to the spp waves can occur entirely due to the finite cross - sections of the nanocolumns .",
    "this validates the point that non - preservation of the polarization state in the scattered fields causes the coupling to spp waves .",
    "the indirect coupling of the incident @xmath2-polarized light excites spp waves more symmetrically for @xmath109 than the direct coupling of the incident @xmath1-polarized light .",
    "however , we note that the overall transmittance is higher in the simulated results than the experimental measurements",
    ". this could arise due to various assumptions about the thickness of the metal layer ( absent in the simulations ) and the density of the columns along the grating lines .",
    "an additional mechanism for both the coupling of spp waves to @xmath2-polarized light as well as the lowered transmittance can arise from imperfections in the fabricated structures which leads to slightly misaligned nanocolumns or bending of the nanocolumns along the grating direction .",
    "such nanocolumns can create cross - polarization in the plane of incidence for @xmath2-polarized light which can also couple to spp waves .",
    "we fabricated periodically patterned ctfs of silver that can support the propagation of spp waves on their interfaces with isotropic dielectric materials .",
    "these structures show strongly asymmetric diffraction and can provide for unidirectional coupling to spp waves which can be useful in many optical devices .",
    "the bruggeman formalism was used to homogenize the silver ctfs into homogeneous hyperbolic biaxial materials .",
    "the predicted dispersions of the spp waves matched the measured dispersions very well .",
    "the porosity can be controlled easily through the direction of metal - vapor flux during fabrication and is a critical parameter for controlling the dispersions .",
    "both the nanocolumnar tilt angle and length need to be optimized for obtaining the desired blaze action and coupling strengths at the desired frequencies through full - wave 3-d photonic structure calculations .",
    "our work creates a strong basis for the understanding of the photonic properties of plasmonic ctfs and devices based on such structured nanomaterials .",
