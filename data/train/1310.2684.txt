    "in recent years , a large amount of work has been invested on sources of the solar neighborhood .",
    "a main driver is certainly the study of extra - solar planets or planetary systems and their host stars . since it is also realized that a considerable fraction of the latter are non - single",
    ", the question arises to what extent the existing stellar companions may affect the overall planet formation .",
    "likewise , undiscovered companions influence the calculated properties of the host star and as such the derived properties of the extra - solar planet . as a result , there is a vital search for as yet unknown companions , mostly white , red , and brown dwarfs .",
    "however  and more generally speaking  it is also appreciated that it is of principal importance to know the local inventory as this has far - reaching consequences on all scales of astrophysical research .",
    "the locally existing degenerates mostly contribute to issues of the mass density , the stellar populations , and the early galactic epochs .",
    "simultaneously , there is a major interest in the star formation process in general because evidence is growing that stars often are created as multiple systems @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the formation of very wide binaries is difficult to understand , because their observed separation can exceed the typical size of a collapsing cloud core .",
    "recent observations have shown that very wide binaries are frequently members of triple systems @xcite and that close binaries often have a distant third companion @xcite .",
    "dynamical interactions between members of such systems lead to close encounters which generally lead to the ejection of the lowest mass member and thus to the formation of a stable binary @xcite .",
    "however , a bound triple with long - term stability can also be created in the presence of a gravitational potential @xcite which is frequently fulfilled when the newborn stars are still embedded in their cloud cores @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite presented @xmath0body simulations of the dynamical evolution of newborn triple systems that match observations of very wide systems @xcite .",
    "the simulations show that although triples start as very compact systems , one component may be dynamically scattered into a very distant orbit on timescales of millions of years .",
    "simultaneously , the orbits of the other two stars shrink , resulting in a very close binary system .",
    "the study of the nearby field stars , as the final product of these initial dynamical processes , serves as an important observational constraint in this context .",
    "advances in high - precision radial velocities ( _ _ rv__s ) and high - angular resolution imaging have led to the discovery of numerous new neighbors in the solar vicinity .",
    "the latter observations also benefit from inclusion of as yet less explored wavelength regions  such as the infrared  where cool sources are better traceable . yet",
    ", highly - resolved imaging observations are often confined to the innermost few arcseconds around a primary target , i.e. , they do not reach beyond the classical regions in the search for visual binaries .",
    "large multi - epoch star surveys , on the other hand , are mostly concerned with the search for common - proper - motion ( cpm ) objects that can even surpass spatial distances of more than one degree .",
    "yet , this approach often refers to photographic plate material for the first - epoch observations and this in turn leads to the well - known peculiarity that a considerable region around luminous and mostly nearby stars generally remains inaccessible .",
    "depending on how bright the sources actually are , this may reach from a few arcseconds and can easily exceed one arcminute for stars of third magnitude or brighter .",
    "two examples where close companions may be easily missed are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_hd114853_dss ] .",
    "eso digitized sky survey plates with a @xmath1arcmin field are compared to 2mass infrared @xmath2 images for hd114853 ( left ) and @xmath3vir = hd129502 ( right ) . in the case of hd114853 ( @xmath4mag )",
    "the companion is hidden behind a diffraction pattern of component a , in the case of @xmath3vir = hd129502 ( @xmath5mag ) the companion is masked by the bright straylight of the primary .    in consequence",
    ", this means that one usually encounters many unexplored  white patches \" on celestial maps , depending on which survey one intends to rely on .",
    "the situation is imaginably  and ironically  most serious for the nearby stars . for a particular example",
    ", we mention the prominent fourth - magnitude exoplanet host star @xmath6and , whose @xmath7arcsec distant mdwarf companion was only uncovered a decade ago by @xcite . from this @xmath6and",
    "b discovery paper and as also more recently discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their fig .",
    "7 ) , it is most obvious that a secondary at about half the spatial distance of @xmath6and  b would be difficult to discern in the light of its primary .",
    "thus , and as the most recent observations by @xcite again demonstrate , our census of the nearby cpm companions is far from complete .",
    "the situation is particularly severe in the southern hemisphere , where  traditionally  there has been a less rigorous monitoring of celestial objects . in this work ,",
    "we present near - infrared imaging and astrometry on solar neighborhood stars within 25pc .",
    "in particular , we report the discovery of seven faint cpm companions to solar - type primaries at spatial distances ranging from 12arcsec to 42arcsec , i.e. , in regions where previous photographic material mostly fails .",
    "( red ) and @xmath8 ( blue ) offsets obtained by matching the coordinates ( within 1 arcsec ) of all stars detected in the iris frames with the 2mass catalogue . the width of the respective gaussian distribution displays the scatter @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we attribute the small systematic deviations in @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath13 ) to the scamp astrometry process in the data reduction . ]    for our first - epoch observations we make use of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog @xcite , whereas for the second and third epoch we refer to the recent wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) data @xcite and our own measurements .",
    "the latter were taken with the iris telescope of the universittssternwarte bochum near cerro armazones in chile @xcite during october and november 2012 .",
    "we employed a dithering pattern with 20 exposures on the object and 20 exposures on a nearby sky field with an integration time of 10s each .",
    "our iraf - based reduction pipeline cares about the common corrections like flat , sky , bad pixel , etc . and compensates the geometrical image distortion with the iraf tool _ geotran _ ; for that purpose we use a theoretically calculated zemax matrix created for our iris camera .",
    "next we construct catalogs with @xmath14coordinates for all sources on the individual frames ( _ sextractor _ ) ; simultaneously , we download the corresponding coordinates from the 2mass catalog . both coordinate lists  iris and 2mass ",
    "are matched ( _ scamp _ ) and the resulting astrometry is stored in the fits - header of each individual exposure ; frames with non - unique astrometric solutions were rejected .",
    "the useful individual frames were then shifted against each other ( _ wregister _ ) and combined into a single frame ( _ imcombine _ ) that contains the astrometry .",
    "eventually , the tool _ sextractor _ provides the final source list from the combined image with _ wcs",
    "_ positions . in all cases cpm pairs were easily discovered by eye by just blinking the iris and 2mass images and compare their displacement with respect to the numerous field stars on the frames .",
    "the astrometric accuracy of the iris data is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig_hist.dcf.cpm ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,^ \" , ]",
    "+    almost each of the nine cpm systems may contain an inner aa - ab binary as demonstrated by the supplementary information in table  [ triple ] .",
    "this boosts the majority of these stars toward triple or higher level systems .",
    "table  [ statistic ] summarizes a preliminary cpm statistics for bright population i stars within 25pc : our  northern sample \" contains 274 stars north of dec@xmath15 @xcite , the ",
    "southern sample `` comprises 155 stars @xcite .",
    "the spectral types cover a range from b to k2 ; however , there is just one b star ( regulus ) and only about 25 a stars which means that more than 90% of the sample are solar - type stars of type f , g and early k. we have arbitrarily divided our samples in two groups with projected orbital distances larger than 100 and 500au , respectively .",
    "the present paper adds one ' ' distant \" cpm in the north ( hd129502 ) and five cpms in the south two of which have orbital distances @xmath16au .",
    "the comparison between the cpm percentage in the north and south suggests that one can expect about 12 further southern cpms of which 10 have orbital distances larger than 500au . a possible future detection of those stars ,",
