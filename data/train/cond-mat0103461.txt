    "over the last decade , the iii - v nitrides have matured as a technologically important semiconductor system .",
    "various optoelectronic products based on the nitrides have already gone commercial @xcite,@xcite ; the material system holds abundant promise for more .",
    "along with the technological importance , the nitrides offer a rich diversity of new physical phenomena such as large polarization fields and large band offsets @xcite .",
    "these novel phenomena present a new way of creating two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs ) at heterointerfaces - without intentional modulation doping .",
    "m - plane growth on tetragonal lialo@xmath0 has been achieved @xcite , thus giving the experimentalist control over polarization fields . recently , integral as well as fractional quantum hall effects have been observed in algan / gan 2degs , confirming that the 2degs are of high purity @xcite .",
    "however the measured electron mobilities are still much lower than their counterparts in the algaas / gaas 2degs @xcite .",
    "it is now well known that low temperature electron mobility in the purest algaas / gaas 2degs is limited by coulombic scattering by remote ionized donors @xcite .",
    "however , 2degs in algan / gan have been created without any intentional modulation doping ; still the low temperature electron mobilities are much lower than the algaas / gaas 2degs .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of transport in the algan / gan 2deg , and pinpoint the sources of scattering that are currently limiting low temperature electron mobilities .",
    "we first determine the transport regime to choose the correct theoretical treatment .",
    "low - temperature transport in the nitride heterostructure 2degs is characterized by long mean free paths ; typical numbers are @xmath1 for a 2deg of density @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the ioffe - regel criterion @xmath4 is exceeded many times over , which is characteristic of diffusive rather than hopping transport .",
    "we point out an interesting fact : the characteristic dimensionless parameter @xmath5 ( the ratio of electron - electron potential energy and the kinetic energy ) , which is a measure of the importance of many - particle interactions , ranges from @xmath6 for algan / gan 2deg density @xmath2 to @xmath7 for 2deg density @xmath8 .",
    "this means that for algan / gan 2degs with low 2deg densities , many body effects such as exchange and interaction can play important effects .",
    "this sensitivity stems from the relatively heavy electron effective mass ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 being the free electron mass ) compared to other iii - v semiconductors .",
    "however , electron - electron scattering is elastic .",
    "drift in response to applied external fields can not be impeded by this form of scattering , since energy lost by one electron in a scattering event is gained by the other and both electrons contribute to the drift current . when combined with other scattering mechanisms ,",
    "this form of scattering may affect the calculated mobility ; however , we neglect such effects under the ( qualified ) assumption @xcite that such corrections are indeed small",
    ".    so the treatment is best affected by neglecting localization and many - particle effects altogether , and treating electron wavefunctions as extended single particle bloch states .",
    "hence , transport is treated in the traditional regime of the born - approximation .",
    "scattering rate from a state @xmath11 to a state @xmath12 is evaluated using fermi s golden rule ,    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the reduced planck s constant , @xmath15 is the product of the matrix element @xmath16 of the scattering potential @xmath17 between plane wave states @xmath18 and the matrix element @xmath19 between lattice - periodic bloch functions .",
    "owing to the wide bandgap of the nitrides , the matrix element @xmath20 , the approximation holding good even if there are large non - parabolicities in the dispersion @xcite .",
    "once the matrix element is determined for different forms of scatterers , transport scattering time is evaluated by summing over all the available final states    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the total number of scatterers in the 2d area @xmath23 . converting the summation to an integral over the quasi - continuous wavevector states and exploiting the degenerate nature of the carriers for averaging @xmath24 ( all electrons carrying current have energy @xmath25 ) , the measurable transport scattering rate @xmath26 reduces to the simple form @xcite    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the areal density of scatterers , @xmath29 is the conduction band electron effective mass , @xmath30 is the fermi wavevector , @xmath31 being the 2deg density .",
    "also , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the screened matrix element for a perfect 2deg ( @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35 is a form factor that takes the finite extent of the realistic 2deg along the @xmath36 direction into account . for low temperature transport in the lowest subband ( the electric quantum limit ) , we denote the form factor by @xmath37 .    for accurate evaluation of scattering rates ,",
    "the finite extent of the 2deg along the @xmath36 direction must be accounted for .",
    "the exact nature of the spatial extent can be evaluated from a self - consistent solution of schrodinger and poisson equations using the charge control model for the device structure .",
    "such a solution is shown in figure 1 for an al@xmath38ga@xmath39n / gan 2deg @xcite . however ,",
    "for analytic evaluation of scattering rates , the fang - howard variational wavefunction is a better candidate , and has been used successfully for transport calculations in the past .",
    "the form of the function is    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is a variational parameter .",
    "the parameter is chosen such that it minimizes the energy @xcite ; this is achieved when @xmath42 , where the sybols have their usual meaning .",
    "this form of the wavefunction leads to a form factor    @xmath43    for transport in the electric quantum limit .",
    "screening by free carriers in the 2deg is also affected due to the finite extent .",
    "this is reflected in another form factor @xmath44 entering the long - wavelength ( @xmath45 ) 2d dielectric function @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 @xcite , and @xmath48 is the thomas - fermi wavevector . for a perfect 2deg , @xmath49 , and",
    "both form factors reduce to unity .",
    "transport theory relies on the accurate identification of defects that lead to scattering of conduction electrons .",
    "transport in algaas / gaas 2degs is well understood .",
    "the list of scattering sources comprises of _ ionized impurities _ , _ interface roughness _ at the algaas / gaas barrier , _ alloy scattering _ due to penetration of the 2deg wavefunction into the barrier , and _ phonons_. in algan / gan 2degs , all these scattering mechanisms are present , in addition to some others .",
    "charged dislocations and charged surface donors are the new defects , and their effects on transport for 2degs have received little attention .",
    "we find the scattering rates arising out of these new defects as well as the traditional defects for the algan / gan 2degs .",
    "realistic values of impurity concentrations specific to algan / gan samples got from experimental characterization techniques are incorporated in the analysis .      due to the large lattice mismatch of gan with the substrates on which it is epitaxially grown ( sic and sapphire ) ,",
    "@xmath50 dislocations are typically formed .",
    "these dislocations originate from the nucleation layer at the interface of the substrate and gan , growing up to the surface without termination .",
    "the dislocations are observed to grow along the ( 0001 ) direction , piercing through interfaces .",
    "the model used for the electrical nature of dislocations to study it s effect on transport is that of a charged line - the dislocation is modeled as a line of dangling bonds , which introduce states in the energy gap .",
    "the dangling bonds are separated by a lattice constant @xmath51 along the ( 0001 ) direction .",
    "this model was introduced by read and shockley @xcite , and has been successful in explaining electron mobility in bulk semiconductors , including gan .",
    "the lineal charge density is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the electron charge , and @xmath54 is the occupancy number for each available site .",
    "there has been some controversy regarding the electrical activity of dislocations , as well as for the value of the occupation function @xmath54 , given that dislocations are charged . through scanning capacitance microscopy measurements , hansen _ et .",
    "@xcite showed that dislocations in gan are electrically charged .",
    "brazel _ et .",
    "al._@xcite and recently , hsu _",
    "al._@xcite have shown that dislocations offer highly preferential localized current paths .",
    "additionally , kozodoy _ et .",
    "al._@xcite showed a direct relationship of reverse leakage currents in gan junction diodes to the number of dislocations .",
    "et al_@xcite confirm the notion of charged dislocations from their scanning capacitance voltage measurements , and are also able to predict the amount of charge on the dislocations and the screening lengths around the charged lines .",
    "hence , experimental evidence strongly suggests that dislocations introduce states in band gap .",
    "however , the controversy has been in theoretical studies .",
    "al . _ calculated from both ab initio local density functional methods and density functional tight binding methods @xcite for both pure edge and pure screw type dislocations . for screw type dislocations ,",
    "the authors found deep states in the bandgap .",
    "they found no deep states in the gap for pure edge type dislocations .",
    "calculations of wright and furthmller @xcite and wright and grossner @xcite , however , show that for both aln and gan , edge dislocations introduce electronic states in the gap .",
    "al._@xcite did an energetics study of the occupation probabilities for the states introduced by threading edge dislocations , drawing upon the theoretical results of wright _ et .",
    "al._. they find that electronic states introduced in the bandgap by threading edge dislocations can be multiply occupied , and the probability of occupation of sites is a function of the background doping density .    scattering by charged dislocations in bulk semiconductors has been treated by several authors @xcite , including for gan @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , scattering by dislocations for reduced dimensional electron systems had not been analyzed until recently @xcite .",
    "we recently derived the scattering rates for a perfect two - dimensional electron gas ( i.e. , with zero spatial extent in the z - direction ) for charged threading edge dislocations .",
    "we derive scattering rates in this work for a realistic two - dimensional electron gas with a finite spatial distribution in the z - direction .",
    "figure 2 captures the essential model for the problem .    for simplicity , we assume the dielectric constants in the barrier and gan to be same @xmath55 .",
    "the dislocation line charge is written as @xmath56 , where @xmath53 is the electron charge , @xmath51 is the lattice constant in gan along the ( 0001 ) direction , and @xmath54 is the fraction of occupied acceptor states introduced by the dislocation .",
    "the fourier transform of the screened potential experienced by the 2deg due to a differential charge element @xmath57 located a distance @xmath36 away from the interface is given by @xcite    @xmath58    @xmath59 and @xmath44 were introduced earlier .",
    "@xmath48 is the thomas - fermi screening wavevector for 2d systems , given by @xmath60 , @xmath61 being the effective bohr radius in 2d .",
    "the total potential seen at the 2deg is got by summing potentials of all differential elements ,    @xmath62    the scattering rate is evaluated by using equation [ 3 ] as    @xmath63    with the substitution @xmath64 , we reduce the expression to    @xmath65    the dimensionless integral @xmath66 depends on the 2deg density .",
    "when @xmath67 with @xmath68 , the integral factor reduces to    @xmath69    which is the expression for a perfect 2deg with no spatial extent in the @xmath36 direction .",
    "we find the assumption in previous works for bulk gan scattering @xcite,@xcite that @xmath70 predicts a lower low temperature mobility than the highest values reported till date .",
    "the energy calculations by leung _ et .",
    "al_@xcite show that typically only @xmath71 of the states will be occupied @xmath72 for a background donor density of @xmath73 and dislocation densities in the @xmath74 range ( which is typical of high purity molecular beam epitaxy samples ) .",
    "@xcite reported @xmath75 from their scanning capacitance - voltage measurements .",
    "this makes dislocations much more benign as scatterers than initially thought - note that @xmath76 appears in the denominator in the expression for mobility",
    ". electron mobility due to scattering by charged dislocations _ alone _",
    "@xmath77 is shown in figure [ 3 ] as a function of 2deg carrier density .",
    "we show the values calculated for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the dependence on 2deg density is found to be @xmath80 ( for a perfect 2deg , the dependence was found to be @xmath81 ) @xcite .",
    "a useful numerical formula that can be incorporated in monte - carlo techniques for treating dislocation scattering limited electron mobility in 2degs is    @xmath82    where @xmath83 are in @xmath84 , @xmath54 is the occupation function for filled states , and the mobility is in @xmath85 .",
    "there is no temperature dependence , reflecting the degenerate nature of the carriers .",
    "also , at a dislocation density of @xmath86 , the mean spacing between the dislocations is @xmath87 , whereas the fermi wavelength for a 2deg concentration of @xmath88 is @xmath89 .",
    "this implies that there can be no interference effects in transport - thus the approximation that the scatterers are randomly distributed is a good one .",
    "the spirit of the hemt 2deg is a spatial separation of the 2deg from the ionized donors , thus reducing scattering and improving electron mobility .",
    "state of the art algan / gan systems have @xmath90 unintentional residual background donors .",
    "these donors have been detected by secondary ion mass spectroscopy ( sims ) measurements to be oxygen and silicon atoms that incorporate during the growth process .",
    "transport scattering rate due to a homogeneous background donor density of @xmath91 is given by    @xmath92    the absence of intentional modulation donors implies that there is a different source of 2deg electrons .",
    "we point out that polarization by itself _",
    "can not _ supply electrons , since on the whole , it is charge neutral .",
    "what polarization _ can _ do however , is induce the transfer of electrons from any other possible source to satisfy requirements of electrochemical equilibrium .",
    "background impurity densities can not be the source of the 2deg electrons since their concentration is too low for providing the high density 2deg densities observed .",
    "electrons in the 2deg for nitride heterostructures are believed to be supplied by surface donor states .",
    "the positive surface charge forms a sheet - charge dipole with the 2deg which tries to neutralize the polarization dipole in the algan layer .",
    "have confirmed the presence of surface donor states from xps measurements @xcite .",
    "these experiments confirm the suspicion that the surface states are charged , and are responsible for forming the 2deg , as inferred from a purely charge control analysis by ibbetson @xcite .",
    "the surface donor states will form a source of scattering identical to a delta - doped remote donor layer .",
    "thus , the transport scattering rate for the surface donors can be treated in the same way as an ordinary delta - doped donor layer .",
    "if the sheet density of such donors is @xmath93 , and is at a distance @xmath94 form the heterostructure interface ( note that this is also the thickness of the algan barrier ) , the scattering rate is given by    @xmath95      alloy disorder scattering originates from the randomly varying alloy potential in the barrier .",
    "this form of scattering is known to be the mobility limiting mechanism for 2degs confined in an alloy channel such as in ingaas / gaas heterostructures . in 2degs confined in binary compounds ,",
    "alloy scattering occurs as a result of the finite penetration of the 2deg wavefunction into the barrier ; the scattering rate is given by @xcite    @xmath96    where @xmath97 is the volume associated with each al(ga ) atom , @xmath98 is the difference in potential by replacing a ga atom by al which is taken to be the conduction band offset between the aln and gan , @xmath99 is the wavevector characterizing the penetration of the wavefunction into the algan barrier ( @xmath100 is the conduction band offset ) , and @xmath101 is the integrated probability of finding the electron in the barrier .",
    "figure 4 shows the probability @xmath101 as a percentage .    in algaas / gaas heterostructures ,",
    "this form of scattering is small , and often negligible@xcite .",
    "however , in algan / gan heterostructures , the large electron effective mass , the high 2deg density and the large alloy scattering potential all combine to make this form of scattering strong in spite of the confinement in the binary semiconductor .",
    "figure [ 5 ] shows the alloy scattering limited electron mobility for a range of 2deg densities and alloy compositions .",
    "the current highest mobilities reported in the algan / gan 2degs are highlighted , and the path to higher mobilities is clear from the plot .      scattering at rough interfaces can be severe if the 2deg density is high , since the 2deg tends to shift closer to the interface as the density increases .",
    "interfaces , however , can be grown nearly atomically flat by modern epitaxial growth techniques .",
    "the roughness at heterojunction interfaces has been traditionally modeled by a gaussian autocovariance function .",
    "scattering rate by a rough interface with a root mean square roughness height @xmath102 and a correlation length @xmath103 is given by    @xmath104    where the integral is rendered dimensionless by the substitution @xmath64 .",
    "figure [ 6 ] shows how the distance of the centroid of the 2deg distribution from the heterojunction interface for different alloy concentrations varies with the 2deg sheet density .",
    "the dependence was calculated from the self - consistent fang - howard variational wavefunction .",
    "the dependence on the 2deg density is characteristically much stronger than on alloy composition .",
    "interface roughness scattering affects transport even in the presence of a binary barrier ( i.e. , absence of alloy scattering ) .",
    "recently , yulia _ et .",
    "_ reported the successful growth of aln / gan heterostructures , which removes alloy scattering completely @xcite .",
    "in such high - density samples , the mobility is interface roughness scattering limited , and the calculated low temperature mobilities are well explained by our theory .",
    "a large distribution of interface roughness sites can form localized states of the 2deg instead of the extended states for high density samples ; this limit was analyzed by zhang and singh , who proposed that in such a case , transport will require phonon assisted hopping @xcite .",
    "however , since the highest reported mobilities are for low density samples ( @xmath105 ) with no temperature dependence of conductivity for @xmath106 , we believe that transport in the best samples is by band conduction .",
    "interface roughness scattering limited transport mobility has a characteristic @xmath107 dependence for 2degs in quantum wells ( of thickness @xmath103 ) , which can be observed by transport measurements on quantum wells of different thicknesses .",
    "an interesting feature of the iii - v nitrides is that due to the unscreened polarization fields in thin epitaxial layers , there is a large band - bending inside the well even under no external bias .",
    "hence the 2deg samples one interface much more than the other ; this acts as an in - built mechanism to restrict interface roughness effects on 2degs confined in thin unscreened quantum wells .",
    "phonon scattering limits electron mobility at temperatures @xmath108 for 2degs .",
    "scattering by three types of phonons are known to affect transport - by deformation potential acoustic phonons , piezoelectric acoustic phonons , and polar optical phonons .",
    "scattering by both types of acoustic phonons is considered elastic for all practical purposes .",
    "scattering rates of the two types of phonons have been widely studied ; we use the form of scattering rate derived for the fang - howard wavefunction @xcite .",
    "optical phonon ( pop ) energy for the wurtzite gan crystal lattice is higher than other iii - vs @xmath109 .",
    "scattering by polar optical phonons is highly inelastic .",
    "treatment of scattering of electrons confined to two dimensions by polar optical phonons has proved to be a difficult problem to solve , and no satisfactory theory exists . in spite of the highly inelastic nature of polar optical phonon scattering , an approximate momentum relaxation rate in 2degs",
    "was derived by gelmont , shur , and stroscio , which accurately explains experimental data over a wide temperature range @xcite . the result ( in cgs units )",
    "is given by    @xmath110    here , @xmath111 is the polar optical phonon wavevector , @xmath112 is the bosonic distribution function @xmath113 - 1)$ ] , and @xmath114 is given by    @xmath115    @xmath116 being the dimensionless variable @xmath117 . for mobility calculations at high temperatures , we use this expression .",
    "unintentionally doped ( uid ) gan exhibits a n - type nature .",
    "initially , it was attributed to the formation of nitrogen vacancies . however",
    ", careful study of the energetics of formation of such vacancies by van de walle and neugebauer has shown that formation of nitrogen vacancies is energetically unfavorable @xcite .",
    "zhu and sawaki @xcite derived the scattering rates by possible nitrogen vacancies and tried explaining bulk transport properties from their theoretical calculations . in light of recent revelations of little chance of formation , we choose not to include nitrogen vacancies in our analysis of electron transport .",
    "however , we point out that vacancy formation energies may be lowered around dislocations ; we leave this question open for further studies . in an earlier work",
    ", we presented the theory of scattering arising from the coupling of polarization dipoles with alloy disorder @xcite .",
    "current highest mobility values are much lower than the mobility limited by dipole scattering ; so we do not include that form of scattering in this work .",
    "armed with the scattering rates , we are in a position to relate the theoretical values to experimentally observed transport measurements .",
    "we consider low - temperature transport first .      at low temperatures , the different scattering processes",
    "act independently ; matheissen s rule offers a simple way of combining the effect of all scatterers .",
    "figure [ 7 ] shows a low temperature mobility ( @xmath118 ) map as a function of the 2deg sheet density @xmath31 .",
    "the calculation was done with a dislocation density of @xmath119 , background density @xmath120 , surface donor density @xmath121 which is required from charge control , alloy composition @xmath122 , and interface roughness parameters @xmath12310 , @xmath1242 .",
    "every source of scattering has been considered , and the relative effects are clearly visible in the plot .",
    "total mobility shows a characteristic maximum ; at low sheet densities @xmath125 , charged impurity scattering from background donors , surface donors and dislocations limit electron mobility .",
    "relative concentration of the particular form of charged impurity will determine which is the dominant scatterer .",
    "however , as is evident from the calculation , mobility at typical algan / gan sheet densities is limited by short range scatterers due to alloy disorder and interface roughness . in the range of 2deg densities @xmath126 , alloy scattering or interface roughness scattering dominate , depending on the nature of the barrier",
    "the shaded bands labeled 1 and 2 depict the present - day highest experimental values reported .",
    "samples whose measured values lie in band 1 have alloy barriers of low alloy composition , whereas those in band 2 are for 2degs at aln / gan heterointerfaces .",
    "the importance of short range scatterers was also pointed out by hsu and walukiewicz in their recent work @xcite .",
    "the mobility limit for @xmath127 is ` intrinsic ' in the sense that removal of charged defects ( dislocations , background impurities , etc ) will not be useful in improving the mobility .",
    "the critical density @xmath128 can be used as a guideline for designing high mobility 2deg structures .",
    "we predict that highest low temperature mobilities will be achieved for low density ( @xmath129 ) 2degs . for the same carrier density",
    ", a barrier of aln will have a larger mobility than an algan barrier .",
    "if carrier densities are lowered below the critical density @xmath128 , the effects of charged impurities will be visible .",
    "reduction of carrier density in the algan / gan 2deg is not straightforward , since the 2deg is _ not _ controlled by intentional modulation doping .",
    "gating is one way of achieving low carrier densities ; another way is the growth of gan ( or low composition algan ) cap layers on top of the algan barrier layer .",
    "introduction of acceptors in the barrier can also be used to reduce the 2deg density by compensation , though p - doping in the nitrides is currently not under good control , and it will open another source of scattering .      at high temperatures ( @xmath130 ) , the approximation that various scattering processes are independent breaks down due to strong optical phonon scattering . however , since the total scattering rate is dominated by optical phonon scattering , using matheissen s rule will not cause significant deviations from a more accurate calculation @xcite .    we plot the experimental mobility and carrier concentration values for a high mobility algan / gan 2deg in figure [ 8 ] .",
    "the sample growth specifics was reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the theoretically calculated values of mobility are also plotted for the particular 2deg , showing the effect of all scattering mechanisms .",
    "it is clear that the mobility ( which is one of the highest reported ) is limited by alloy scattering at low temperatures .    for algan / gan heterostructures that have a parallel conducting channel , the 2deg contribution to transport mobility",
    "is masked at high temperatures by transport in the parallel channel .",
    "in such cases , it is important to note that the measured hall mobility has contributions from both the 2deg and a parallel channel which is in general of lower mobility .",
    "the parallel channel is through low mobility 3d carriers thermally activated from unintentional donors which freeze out at low temperatures .",
    "so pure 2deg effects can be seen only at cryogenic temperatures .",
    "this leads to the discrepancy in measured and theoretical mobility calculated for pure 2degs .",
    "this is evident in figure [ 8 ] - there is an onset of parallel conduction through carriers in the parallel 3d layer .",
    "the sharp increase in measured carrier concentration is accompanied by a drop ( shaded region ) in measured mobility from the theoretical values , which are calculated for a pure 2deg .",
    "room temperature 2deg mobilities exceeding @xmath131 have been reported for samples in which parallel conduction is negligible , or through a high mobility channel @xcite .",
    "removal of the parallel conducting layer will help in reaching the theoretical mobility limits for 2degs imposed by pop scattering .",
    "in conclusion , the insensitivity of high density algan / gan 2deg transport to various charged impurities in general , and charged dislocations in particular was shown .",
    "the possible charge configuration of dislocation states was extracted from experimental mobility values .",
    "mobility limiting scattering mechanisms were determined .",
    "alloy disorder scattering was shown to be limiting mobilities for algan / gan 2degs at low temperatures .",
    "interface roughness scattering is the mobility limiting scattering mechanism for high density 2degs at aln / gan interfaces .",
    "ways of getting around these apparent ` intrinsic ' limits to achieve higher mobilities were outlined .",
    "effect of parallel conduction at room temperature was shown to affect measured mobility and cause deviations from the theoretically predicted values .",
