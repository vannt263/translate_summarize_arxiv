    "drinfeld proved @xcite that @xmath2 is a lie bialgebra if and only if it constitutes , together with its dual @xmath6 , a _ manin triple _ @xmath0 , where @xmath7 as vector spaces , @xmath1 is a lie algebra possessing a nondegenerate invariant symmetric bilinear form @xmath8 such that @xmath2 and @xmath6 are isotropic with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "the known examples of forms @xmath8 arise from the cartan matrix of @xmath1 in case the cartan matrix is symmetrizable .",
    "such a form @xmath8 corresponds to the quadratic casimir element @xmath9 ( which for infinite dimensional @xmath1 belongs , strictly speaking , to a completion of @xmath10 , rather than to @xmath10 itself ) .",
    "etingof and kazhdan showed @xcite how to @xmath3-quantize the bialgebra structure of @xmath11 in terms of @xmath1 and @xmath9 and proved that such a quantization is unique .",
    "there are two ways to superize these results and constructions .",
    "one is absolutely straightforward . do not misread us !",
    "we only refer to the above - mentioned examples and result from deep and difficult papers @xcite and @xcite .",
    "( besides , performing the actual implementation of these `` straightforward '' generalizations is quite a job and , moreover , we encounter several unexpected phenomena , e.g. , while presenting simple lie superalgebras , cf .",
    "@xcite . )    the only totally new feature of `` straightforward '' superization is the fact that there is just one ( in the class of @xmath12-graded lie superalgebras of polynomial growth ) series of simple lie superalgebras @xmath13 ( see @xcite ) and one `` exception '' , @xmath14 , ( see @xcite ) which have no cartan matrix but , nevertheless , possess an invariant nondegenerate supersymmetric even bilinear form .",
    "another superization , performed by g.  olshansky , is totally new .",
    "drinfeld observed that the definition of manin triples does not require a nondegenerate symmetric invariant bilinear form on @xmath2 . for a simple lie algebra @xmath2 ,",
    "be it finite dimensional or of polynomial growth , such a form always exists ; hence , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , i.e. , is the _",
    "double _ of the bialgebra @xmath2 .",
    "g.  olshansky @xcite described two series of simple lie superalgebras @xmath2 without nondegenerate symmetric invariant bilinear form for which there still exist manin triples .",
    "his construction gives solutions to the _ quantum _ yang - baxter equation in the cases the _ classical _ equation has _ no _ solutions , compare with the classification @xcite .",

    "observe that in some of our examples , as well as in @xcite , @xmath2 is not simple but close \" to a simple one ( like affine kac  moody algebras ) .      for background on linear algebra in superspaces and the list of simple stringy and vectorial lie superalgebras",
    "see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we recall here only the additional data . on a simple finite dimensional lie algebra @xmath1 there exists only one up to proportionality invariant ( with respect to the adjoint action ) nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form . in this one - dimensional space of invariant forms one",
    "usually chooses for the point of reference the _ killing form _ @xmath18 . for any irreducible finite dimensional representation @xmath19 of @xmath1",
    "we have a proportional form @xmath20 .    remark . in reality , the killing form is not the easiest to use , but since all of the forms on the simple lie superalgebra ( of polynomial growth or finite dimensional ) are proportional to each other , one can take most convenient for the task . for @xmath21 , for example , it is more convenient to take the form associated with the standard representation : @xmath22 .    _ ( @xcite ) _ an invariant ( with respect to the adjoint action ) nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form on a simple lie superalgebra @xmath1 , if exists , is unique up to proportionality .",
    "observe that on lie _",
    "super_algebras the form can be either even or odd , the killing form can be identically zero even if there is another , nondegenerate , form .",
    "recall that for the matrices in the standard format @xmath23 with elements in a supercommutative superalgebra @xmath24 the _ supertrace _ is defined as @xmath25 let @xmath26 be the lie superalgebra of supermatrices @xmath27 , where @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",

    "the form ( [ ( 1.1.2 ) ] ) is even or odd together with @xmath42 ; it induces a nondegenerate form on the simple lie superalgebra @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath1 be the lie superalgebra @xmath44 of contact vector fields on @xmath45 , where we consider either a compact supermanifold @xmath45 or contact vector fields generated by functions with compact support .",

    "we set @xmath53 in @xcite the even quadratic casimir element @xmath9 for @xmath54 corresponding to @xmath8 is explicitly computed . in terms of this element a solution of the classical yang - baxter equation can be expressed in the same way as in @xcite , namely , @xmath55 , and from this solution a quantum solution can be uniquely recovered thanks to the general uniqueness theorems of @xcite , @xcite .",

    "( observe that this implies that we can take for @xmath2 nonisomorphic borel subalgebras and get various types of defining relations for @xmath1 .",
    "this observation applies not only to the superization of example 3.2 in @xcite  finite dimensional lie superalgebras with a symmetrizable cartan matrix  but to infinite dimensional superizations and the ( analogues of ) borel subsuperalgebras of @xmath4 and @xmath14 considered below . for a classification of systems of simple roots and for a description of borel superalgebras see @xcite , for a description of defining relations see @xcite and refs . therein . )      * 2.1*.
