    "signal processing plays a central role of a truly enormous range of the astrophysical problems .",
    "these incluse , for example , rotational periodicity , behavior of stellar magnetic ativity ( flares , spots , faculae and plages ) , oscilations and noise .",
    "much of traditional signal processing has relied upon a relatively small class of problems , for example , stationary and cyclostationary signal characterized by a form of translational invariance .",
    "it is not suprising that the fourier transform ( ft ) is considered the key tool in the analysis and manipulation of these problems .",
    "but , there are many signals whose defining characteristic is their invariance not to translation but rather to @xmath1 , i.e. , the process exhibit a dependence on different time scales .",
    "in addition , while the ft plays a central role in the analysis and manipulation of both statiscally and deterministically translation - invariant signal , the _ wavelet transform _ ( wt ) plays an analogous role for the kinds of scale - invariant signal .    wavelet analysis is becoming a common tool for analyzing localized variations of power within a time series . by decomposing a time series into time ",
    "frequency plane , it is possible to determine both the dominant modes of variability and how those modes vary in time ( see torrence & compo 1998 for futher details)@xcite .",
    "contrary to classical fourier analysis that decomposes a signal into different sines and cosines which are not bounded in time , the wavelet transform uses functions characterized by scale ( period ) and position in time .",
    "the wavelet transform has been used for numerous studies in astrophysics , including signal  noise periodicity and decomposition as well as the signature of differential rotation in stellar light curves . in the present work ,",
    "we apply the morlet wavelet with an adjustable parameter @xmath0 ( see section 2 ) , which can be fine - tuned to produce optimal resolutions of time and frequency , where for large values of @xmath0 give better time resolution .",
    "the use of the morlet wavelet allow the best trade  off between time and frequency resolution , as the gaussian function is its own fourier transform ( oliver et al .",
    "in addition , we apply the haar wavelet for decomposition at levels of light curves .",
    "we use the wavelab  package ( library of matlab routines for wavelet analysis ) for",
    "the decomposition and a modified version of colorado  package for the wavelet maps of synthetic and observed light curve .",
    "we also apply the wavelet analysis of signals with gaps and of unevenly spaced data ( frick et al .",
    "many wavelet families can be proposed , depending on the nature of problem .",
    "the most commonly used in astrophysical applications is the morlet wavelet , that can be defined as being the generalization of the windowed fourier transform .",
    "the wavelet transform uses a window whose width is a function of the frequency .",
    "several types of wavelets can be used . however ,",
    "if the signal is sinusoidal , the wavelet should also be chosen to be sinusoidal .",
    "on the other hand , the morlet wavelet ( grossmann & morlet 1984)@xcite represents a sinusoidal oscillation contained within a gaussian envelope .",
    "then the wavelet transform can be written as @xmath2^{2}}e^{-i2\\pi \\nu(t-\\tau)},\\ ] ] represents a sinusoidal oscillation contained within a gaussian package .",
    "then the wavelet transform is given by @xmath3dt,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the complex conjugate of @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the signal .",
    "where an element of the discrete wavelet transform is @xmath7^{2}}e^{-i2\\pi \\nu(t_{j}-\\tau)}.\\ ] ]    the @xmath0parameter controls the resolution in both frequency and time ( baudin et al .",
    "1994)@xcite : @xmath8    @xmath9    and therefore , we have the following uncertainty relationship : @xmath10    the relative frequency resolution is uniquely determined by @xmath0parameter , whereas the time resolution depends on the frequency itself to hold the number of oscillations inside the wavelet constant .",
    "we choose @xmath0 = 0.005 in our analysis in order to balance the time and frequency resolution@xcite .",
    "30days ( diferential rotational period ) , 158days , 1year ( seasonal period ) and 1.3 years ( @xmath11 474.5 days ) periodicities .",
    "the maximum variance corresponds to 1.3 years.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    .",
    "this effect can be caused by dispersion of solar magnetic field on the distance.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]     = 6000 k , log @xmath12 = 4.5 ( cgs units ) , a rotation period of 3 days and a facular behaviour of type f. the period of 1.5 days corresponds to a spot 180@xmath13 shifted longitude.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]",
    "figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] show the morlet wavelet amplitude maps , respectively corresponding to oscillations in the photospheric magnetic field of the sun ( nso / kitt peak data ) , the daily averages of the magnetic field strength b versus time measured by voyager 1 ( v1 ) during 1978 , and synthetic light curve produced by a. f. lanza .",
    "the nso / kitt peak data , as well as voyager 1 and synthetic light curve data , are up to date the best proxies for the stellar light curves that will be obtained by corot space mission .",
    "several time series will be used as example of wavelet analysis .",
    "these series include the nso / kitt peak data used to measure the 1.3year ( rotation of the sun near the base of its convection zone ) and 158day ( high  energy solar flares related to a periodic emergence of magnetic flux that appears near the maxima of some solar cycles ) periodicities as well as rotational period of @xmath11 30 days@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we have used a wavelet analysis ( hempelmann & donahue 1997 ; hempelmann 2002 ; lanza et al .",
    "2003)@xcite to recover information on the solar rotation rate from its _ stellar - like _ light curve .",
    "we also apply the wavelet analysis in sunspot data , reproducing results found in the literature ( oliver et al . 1998 ; krivova & solanki 2002)@xcite .",
    "we also analyze synthetic light curve produced by a _ theoretical simulator _ , developed by the group of stellar astronomy at natal , obtaining well  defined periodicities compared with the real values .",
    "we confirm the results obtained by analysis based on the lomb - scargle periodogram and by the phase dispersion minimization method ( pdm ) for period search using the peranso program@xcite .",
    "but , in contrast with these methods , the wavelet procedure makes possible a global and local analysis of the periodicities@xcite .    the period of rotational modulation changes during the solar cycle because the variability of : first , the latitude of the activity belts and the mean lifetime of the surface features .",
    "the rotational modulation signal can be masked by the active region evolution due to its variability .",
    "the use of wavelet applied in a signal , demonstrated to be a powerful tool for analysis of signals with non  stationary features . on the other hand",
    ", we can through the wavelet method establish clearly the presence of a persistent signal .",
    "but , through the decomposition at level ( or frequency)@xcite we can obtain other periodicities that are not visible when we treat simultaneously all  frequencies .",
