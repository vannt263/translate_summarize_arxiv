    ", the two - level system spontaneously decays to the ground state .",
    "this decay process can be modelled using the hamiltonian , @xmath100 where @xmath41 is the energy difference between the two levels , @xmath5 is the standard pauli matrix while @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the raising and lowering operators , and @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the annihilation and creation operators for mode @xmath105 of the environment .",

    "starting from the state @xmath106 , which means that the atom is in the excited state and that the environment is in the vacuum state , the system - environment state at time @xmath57 can be written as @xmath107 where @xmath108 means that the atom is in the ground state and that mode @xmath105 of the environment is excited .",

    "such a hamiltonian describes interaction between the two - level systems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite in main text ) , in the same fashion as how a common environment induces indirect interaction between the two - level systems ( for the environment - induced case , the indirect interaction is time - dependent ) . here ,",
    "purely to gain some qualitative understanding , we take @xmath127 to be time - independent .",
    "this is clearly a simplified case , but it suffices to illustrate the possible effect of an interaction induced by a common environment . defining @xmath128 to be the survival probability for a single measurement ( @xmath129 can be written as approximately @xmath130^n$ ] ) , it is simple to write for the spin coherent state defined in the main text that @xmath131^{4j } \\sum_{m , n } |\\varsigma|^{2(m + n ) } \\binom{2j}{j + m } \\binom{2j}{j + n } e^{-i \\chi \\tau ( m^2 - n^2)}.\\ ] ]    as shown in fig",

    "now @xmath138 can be used to calculate the ` success ' probability ( where ` success ' means that we measure the system state to be @xmath139 ) for the @xmath21 measurement provided that all the previous measurements have been a success as well .",

    "since we are already focusing on how ( multiple ) measurements can disturb the state of the environment , this initial - product - state assumption is just a convenient starting point for theoretical considerations ( that is , at time zero we prepare the system on state @xmath147 and we assume that the environment is at its equilibrium state ) .",

    "<S>  for a single two - level system , one can use any experimental realization of the spin - boson model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we can consider using a superconducting qubit @xcite , which has the useful feature that both the energy bias and tunneling can be modified appropriately . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the spin - boson model with tunable ohmic dissipation can be realized for such qubits @xcite , and the qubit state can be read out in a non - destructive manner with measurement times in the nanosecond regime , thereby allowing for the possibility of repeated measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the observation of qze was predicted for a single superconducting qubit using current technology @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since dephasing times for superconducting qubits are around @xmath97 @xmath98s @xcite , and both the dephasing time and the measurement rate are expected to increase in the years to come , the experimental observation of the crossover from qze to qaze appears promising . for many two - level systems , </S>",
    "<S> we propose to use a two - component bose - einstein condensate which interacts with a thermal reservoir via collisions , with the system hamiltonian being @xmath99 , where the energy bias can be set to be negligible @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if intermode collisions dominate , then we realize the same system - hamiltonian as before , up to a unitary transformation . </S>",
    "<S> the state that we can repeatedly prepare now is the state with maximum population difference between the two modes . </S>",
    "<S> measurement of the population difference corresponds to measurement of @xmath54 , and it may be achieved by a non - destructive measurement technique , such as phase - contrast imaging @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion _ in conclusion , we have shown that even the simple single - spin pure dephasing model can manifest both the zeno and anti - zeno effects , with the transition between these two regimes strongly dependent on the environment properties . </S>",
    "<S> multiple ( local ) transitions between zeno and anti - zeno regimes may occur for many spins coupled to a common environment . finally , the disturbance to the environment by repeated measurements is shown to have a non - negligible influence on the zeno and anti - zeno effects . </S>",
    "<S> experimental studies of these effects , though challenging , should be an important step towards measurement - based quantum control in open quantum systems .    </S>",
