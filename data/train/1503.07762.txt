    "<S> in this work we perform a comparison between classical molecular static ( cms ) and quantum density functional theory ( dft ) calculations in order to obtain the diffusion coefficients for diluted _ fe - cr _ alloys . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in accordance with bohr s correspondence principle , as the size of the atomic cell ( total number of atoms ) is increased , quantum results with dft approach to the classical ones obtained with cms . </S>",
    "<S> quantum coherence effects play a crucial role in the difference arising between cms and dft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> also , thermal contact with the environment destroys quantum coherent effects making the classical behavior to emerge . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , cms calculations are in good agreement with available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we claim that , the atomic diffusion process in metals is a classical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> then , if reliable semi empirical potentials are available , a classical treatment of the atomic transport in metals is much convenient than dft .    </S>",
    "<S> # 1#1| # 1|#1 # 1#2#1|#2 # 1#2#1|#2 # 1#1     to characterize the crossover between the quantum and the classical worlds is a fundamental quest of modern physics . </S>",
    "<S> for some systems , it is clear that , classical physics arises from quantum physics in the large - number limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is the bohr s correspondence principle @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not fully understood yet how the many - particle limit gives rise to classical physics , and how much of quantum physics still remains . in this framework , </S>",
    "<S> the environment and its temperature plays an important role for the decoherence process @xcite . however , quantum coherence effects at ambient temperatures where observed in biological systems @xcite .    also , for many body systems we must deal with both electrons and atomic nuclei dynamics . due to their masses the nuclei move much slower than the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> then in the bornoppenheimer approximation @xcite the nuclei generate a static external potential in which the electrons are moving .    </S>",
    "<S> first principles ( _ ab initio _ ) quantum mechanical method , such as dft , are employed to obtain the electronic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> dft reduces the quantum many - body problem to the use of functionals of the electron density @xcite , it is presently the most successful approach to compute the electronic structure of matter . </S>",
    "<S> its applicability ranges from atoms , molecules and solids to nuclei and liquids @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electron density determines the potential energy surface that represents the force field where the nuclei dynamics occurs .    in a different approach , a cms treatment , employs phenomenological semi - empirical potentials in order to estimate this force field . </S>",
    "<S> then , the quantum nature of electronic structure is not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> there is a wide variety of semi - empirical potentials , which vary according to the atoms being modeled . </S>",
    "<S> _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> simulations take into account the quantum nature of the electrons , which implies in a higher computational cost than cms . </S>",
    "<S> hence ab initio simulations are limited to smaller systems .    in this work atomic diffusion , in _ fe - cr _ diluted alloys is studied with both cms and quantum dft calculations , in the context of a multi - frequency model . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in accordance with bohr s correspondence principle , as the total number of atoms is increased , quantum results with dft recover the classical ones obtained with cms .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum coherence effects , which are only taken into account by dft , play a crucial role for both the convergence issue of the dft results as a function of supercell size , as well as , in the difference arising between classical cms and quantum dft calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , cms calculations are in good agreement with available experimental data for both solute and solvent diffusion coefficients </S>",
    "<S> . this may not be surprising for a macroscopic system especially for high temperatures that destroys any quantum coherent effect .    </S>",
    "<S> diffusion plays an important role in the kinetics of many materials processes . </S>",
    "<S> experimental measurements of diffusion coefficients are expensive , difficult and in some cases nearly impossible . </S>",
    "<S> a complimentary approach is to determine diffusivities in materials by atomistic computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to predicting diffusion coefficients , computer simulations can provide insights into atomic mechanisms of diffusion processes , creating a fundamental framework for materials design strategies . </S>",
    "<S> also , _ fe - cr _ alloys at low temperatures has important technological consequences . due to their good resistance to void swelling @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> _ fe - cr _ based alloys are of special interest for nuclear applications ( in generation iv and fusion reactors ) .    </S>",
    "<S> atomic transport theory allows to express the diffusion coefficients in terms of the atomic frequency jumps , this is commonly known as the multi - frequency model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , attends were made in order to describe the diffusion process by obtaining numerically the needed frequency jumps with dft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> although disagreement between the experimental and _ ad - initio _ based calculated diffusion coefficients where observed in bcc alloys such as _ ni - cr _ and _ ni - fe _ @xcite , and for @xmath0__fe - ni _ _ and @xmath0__fe - cr _ _ alloys @xcite as well as for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 diluted in fcc @xmath4 @xcite . however , in a recent work huang et _ al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for _ fe _ based diluted alloys , have performed dft based calculations for the tracer diffusion coefficient with a larger number of atoms ( @xmath5 instead of @xmath6 as in @xcite ) that are in good agreement with the experimental data .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> one of us has recently shown @xcite , that tracer diffusion coefficients performed with cms based calculations in diluted _ ni - al _ and _ al - u _ fcc alloys are in excellent agreement with available experimental data for both systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we focus here on the tracer self- and solute diffusion coefficients in a binary _ a - s _ alloy in the diluted limit . for diffusion mediated by vacancies analytical expressions , in terms of the frequency jumps , where calculated by allnatt @xcite and le claire @xcite for fcc and bcc lattices respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in the @xmath7-nearest - neighbor binding model , we identify the jumps as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ 6f - v ] . </S>",
    "<S> the self - diffusion coefficient can be written as , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lattice parameter , @xmath10 is the atom - vacancy exchange frequency in pure @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the self - diffusion correlation factor that is @xmath13 @xcite or @xmath14 @xcite , for bcc or fcc metals respectively . at thermodynamic equilibrium </S>",
    "<S> the vacancy concentration depends on the temperature @xmath15 as , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant while @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively denote the energy and entropy formation of the vacancy in pure @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> the impurity diffusion coefficient , @xmath20 , depends on several jump frequencies , corresponding to the exchanges of the vacancy with the solute atom @xmath21 and with the solvent atoms @xmath11 near @xmath21 , see fig . </S>",

    "<S> the solute correlation factor @xcite is @xmath29 with @xmath30 expressed as a function of @xmath31 as @xmath32 whith the @xmath33 coefficients calculated by koiwa in @xcite .        according to the transition - state theory , in a system of @xmath34 atoms , the exchange frequency between a vacancy and an atom is , @xmath35 in ( [ omegai ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath36 is the migration gibbs free energy and the pre - exponential term , the `` attempt frequency '' @xmath37 , is of the order of the debye frequency . </S>",
    "<S> the gibbs free energy is given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the migration entropy , while @xmath40 is the enthalpy . </S>",
    "<S> as the volume is kept constant and the pressure is considered null , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the internal migration energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , following vineyard s formulation @xcite , the migration frequency jumps are given by @xmath43 in ( [ eq : nue ] ) , @xmath44 are the vacancy migration energies at @xmath45 , while @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 the frequencies of the normal vibrational modes at the initial and saddle points , respectively .    </S>",

    "<S> a magnetic transitions occurs from ferromagnetic , below the curie temperature @xmath50 , to paramagnetic states .    in the case of the bcc phase </S>",

    "<S> we have also considered spin polarization and gga approximation in all calculations . </S>",
    "<S> core electrons are replaced by nonlocal norm - conserving pseudo potentials as in ref . </S>",

    "<S> valence electrons are described by linear combinations of localized pseudoatomic orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the basis sets for both elements consist in two and three localized functions for the 4s and 4p states , respectively , and five for the the 3d states . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum cutoff radius is @xmath51  . </S>",
    "<S> calculations were carried out with @xmath6 and @xmath5 atom supercells , using respectively a @xmath52 and @xmath53 k - point grid , and the methfessel - paxton broadening scheme with a @xmath54 width . </S>",

    "<S> we have verified , for the bcc phase , that the results do not change if we employ a christallyte of @xmath5 atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the equilibrium positions of the atoms by relaxing the structure via the conjugate gradients technique . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice parameters that minimize the crystal structure energy are @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , for bcc and fcc structures , respectively .    in table </S>",
    "<S> [ t4 ] we show our calculations of the activation energies , formation and migration , in a perfect bcc @xmath55 lattice . </S>",
    "<S> we show both , dtf ( with @xmath6 and @xmath5 atoms ) together with cms calculations . </S>",

    "<S> [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in order to compute the jump frequencies , we use expression ( [ eq : nue ] ) , with the migration energies @xmath44 reported in tables [ t4 ] and [ t6 ] , respectively for bcc and fcc phases . for the pre - factor ( [ pinu ] ) , we have taken the experimental values of the migration entropy @xmath62 , as reported in @xcite , in all cases . while the debye frequency has been taken as @xmath63 .    </S>",
    "<S> for the vacancy concentration in ( [ cv0 ] ) , the formation entropy has been taken as @xmath64 , from dft calculations performed in @xcite , while for cms calculations , we used @xmath65 , as obtained in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> once the jump frequencies in the multi - frequency model have been computed , the diffusion coefficients are calculated using analytical expressions ( [ da00 - 1 ] ) and ( [ dbb2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , it has been observed that , due to spontaneous magnetization @xcite , the self - diffusion coefficient deviates from a linear arrhenius relationship , below the curie temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this magnetization effects are , as usually , taken into account , as a correction of the activation energies @xmath66 for the ferromagnetic phase , from those in the paramagnetic @xmath67 ( in table [ t4 ] ) such that , @xmath68 with @xmath69 or @xmath56 and @xmath70 is the ratio of the spontaneous magnetization at @xmath15 to that at @xmath45 @xcite . while @xmath71 , in the full temperature range of the paramagnetic phase . in this respect , </S>",
    "<S> a direct estimation of these parameters from first principles would be of great interest . here , as in @xcite , we interpolate the values of @xmath72 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for both , solute and solvent atoms .    in figure [ lupa-1 ] </S>",
    "<S> , we show the calculated @xmath73 and @xmath74 , using equations ( [ da00 - 1 ] ) and ( [ dbb2 ] ) respectively , with the activations energies in tables [ t4 ] and [ t6 ] for bcc and fcc phases , respectively . as we already mentioned , for the bcc phase we performed dft , with @xmath6 and @xmath5 atoms , as well as , cms calculations . </S>",
    "<S> also in figure [ lupa-1 ] , experimental data taken from refs . @xcite and @xcite are plotted with triangles and stars , respectively for @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    as can be observer in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ lupa-1 ] , below the solvent melting temperature @xmath75 , in accordance with bohr s correspondence principle , as the size of the atomic cell ( total number of atoms ) is increased , quantum results with dft approach to the classical ones obtained with cms .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the bcc supercell with @xmath6 atoms , corresponding to a christallyte of @xmath76 , has a length of @xmath77 , and for @xmath5 atoms , the @xmath53 christallyte has a length of @xmath78 . in both cases , this length is lower than typical electronic quantum coherence length which are of nanometer order ( @xmath79 on @xmath3 @xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> . then , quantum coherence effects , which are only taken into account by dft , play a crucial role for both the convergence issue of the dft results as a function of supercell size , as well as , in the difference arising between classical cms and quantum dft calculations .    instead , with cms , the semimpirical potential are phenomenological and the quantum coherence effects are not taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , cms calculations with @xmath5 or @xmath58 atoms , give the same results .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we must not expect to observe quantum effects for such macroscopic systems especially at the high temperatures here described . in that case , the interaction of the system with the thermal environment implies in decoherence effects , where the classical limit is expected to be recovered @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , our results obtained with cms calculations are in good agreement with available experimental data for both , tracer solute and solvent diffusion coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> note that , similar results have been obtained using , the also classical method , kinetic monte carlo algorithm with temperature dependent pair interactions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it must be emphasized that the agreement between cms based calculations and experimentally measured diffusion coefficients is not fortuitous , it has been recently observed for diffusion in _ al - u _ and _ ni - al _ fcc lattices @xcite . while for this former dft calculation underestimated the diffusion coefficients @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> several possible explanations of the fact that dft calculation are not in agreement with experiments for the diffusion coefficients where argued in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we claim here that this is due to quantum coherence effects arising from dft calculations for the size of the simulation cell being small . </S>",
    "<S> as the size of the simulation cell is increased the dft results converge to the experimental values that can be obtained with cms calculations which is much less expensive .    for the fcc phase , where diffusion coefficients have not yet been measured , </S>",
    "<S> our cms calculations predicts the diffusion behavior .    in summary , in this work we have performed a comparison between quantum dft and cms calculations in order to obtain the diffusion properties in bcc _ fe - cr _ diluted alloys . in accordance with bohr s correspondence principle , as the total number of atoms </S>",
    "<S> is increased , the diffusion coefficients obtained with quantum dft calculations , approach the classical ones obtained with cms . for dft calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the electronic quantum coherence plays a crucial role that is related with the size of the simulation cell . also , thermal contact with the environment as the effect of killing coherence effects making the classical behavior to emerge . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , results obtained with cms calculations are in good agreement with available experimental data for both solute and solvent diffusion coefficients .    </S>",
    "<S> hence , the atomic diffusion process in metals is a classical phenomena , for which the large number of atoms and the temperature has suppressed any quantum coherent effect . </S>",
    "<S> then , if reliable semi empirical potentials are available , a classical treatment of the atomic transport in metals is much convenient than dft .    the comparison between dft and cms calculation is then purposed as a tool to investigate the effective size of quantum effects , such as coherence length . </S>"
