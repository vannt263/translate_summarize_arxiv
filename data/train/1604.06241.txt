    "the discovery of 2012  vp@xmath1 ( trujillo & sheppard 2014 ) has led the astronomical community to recognize that most , if not all , asteroids with semimajor axis , @xmath5 , greater than 150 au and perihelion distance , @xmath6 , greater than 30 au the extreme trans - neptunian objects or etnos display unusual patterns in the values of some of their orbital elements .",

    "the clustering in @xmath10 can be explained as resulting from a selection effect ( if @xmath5=150  au and @xmath12=30  au , then @xmath10=0.8 ) , but this is not the case of the ones observed in @xmath11 , @xmath9 and @xmath7 ( de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos 2014 ) .",
    "one of the theories proposed to explain the observed patterns places their sources in the perturbations due to yet undetected trans - plutonian planets .",
    "perhaps the most popular incarnation of the trans - plutonian massive perturber(s ) paradigm is the so - called planet nine hypothesis .",
    "based on results from extensive computer simulations , batygin & brown ( 2016 ) have predicted the existence of a massive planet located well beyond pluto in order to explain the observed clustering in physical space of the perihelia of six etnos .",
    "the putative object responsible for inducing the clumping has been provisionally designated planet nine .",
    "batygin & brown ( 2016 ) have provided tentative values for the orbital parameters of the proposed 10 @xmath13 planet : @xmath14  au , @xmath15 , @xmath16and @xmath17 .",

    "regarding its origin , planet nine may have been scattered out of the region of the giant planets early in the history of the solar system ( see e.g. bromley & kenyon 2014 , 2016 ) or even captured from another planetary system ( li & adams 2016 ; mustill , raymond & davies 2016 ) .",
    "table [ 6etnos ] shows the values of various orbital parameters for the six objects discussed in batygin & brown ( 2016 ) as well as relevant descriptive statistics ; in this table , unphysical values are displayed for completeness . both 2007 tg@xmath3 and 2012 vp@xmath1 are statistical outliers in terms of @xmath10 as their values are outside the range ( q@xmath23iqr , q@xmath24iqr ) , where q@xmath25 is the first quartile",
    ", q@xmath26 is the third quartile and iqr is the interquartile range or difference between them ; we will see that , within the context of the planet nine hypothesis , 2007 tg@xmath3 is particularly interesting .",

    "the results from these calculations can help us improve our understanding of the dynamical effects of such a hypothetical object , or any other trans - plutonian perturber , on the etno population .",
    "this letter is organized as follows .",
    "our @xmath0-body methodology is briefly described in section 2 .",
    "the evolution of the six etnos included in table [ 6etnos ] subjected to the perturbation of planet nine moving along the nominal orbit described in fienga et al .",
    "( 2016 ) is studied in section 3 .",
    "section 4 repeats the analysis for other orbits .",
    "results are discussed and conclusions summarized in section  5 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that the motion of the planets in the solar system is chaotic ; accurate predictions of their trajectories beyond a few tens of myr are simply not possible ( see e.g. laskar 1989 , 1990 , 1994 , 2008 ) .",
    "extensive computer simulations show that the solar system as we know it remains at all times in a state of marginal stability ; it is therefore reasonable to assume that the inclusion of planet nine must not change this current state of dynamical affairs . on the other hand ,",
    "the known planets are not distributed randomly but organize themselves into planetary groups or collections of loosely connected mutually dynamically dependent planets .",
    "innanen , mikkola & wiegert ( 1998 ) and ito & tanikawa ( 1999 , 2002 ) have shown numerically that the terrestrial planets maintain their stability by sharing and weakening the secular perturbation from jupiter .",
    "tanikawa & ito ( 2007 ) further extended this analysis concluding that the outer planetary group , or jovian planets , forms a subsystem that is not affected by the inner planets ; the motion of the group of the jovian planets may not be perturbed to a significant degree if there is no inner planet group .",
    "this numerical evidence can be used to set up the most efficient yet still reliable physical model to perform @xmath0-body experiments that include an implementation of the planet nine hypothesis for testing . in other words ,",
    "any realistic @xmath0-body study of the dynamical effects of the planet nine conjecture must include the jovian planets , all of them , but can safely neglect the terrestrial planets .",
    "under such physical model , we should expect accurate results within a few tens of myr of @xmath22 ; if a virtual etno becomes dynamically unstable in a few tens of myr , this can be considered as a robust feature of that particular simulation and the same can be said about an orbit that remains fairly stable for a similar period of time .",
    "consistently with the above discussion , our physical model includes the perturbations by the jovian planets ( jupiter to neptune ) . in order to compute accurate initial positions and velocities we used the heliocentric ecliptic keplerian elements provided by the jpl on - line solar system data service ( giorgini et al .",
    "1996 ) and initial positions and velocities ( for both planets and etnos ) based on the de405 planetary orbital ephemerides ( standish 1998 ) referred to the barycentre of the solar system and to the epoch jd tdb 2457400.5 ( 2016-january-13.0 ) , which is the @xmath31 = 0 instant in our figures .",
    "in addition to the orbital calculations completed using the nominal elements of the etnos in table [ 6etnos ] , we have performed additional simulations using control orbits ; the orbital elements of the control orbits have been obtained varying them randomly , within the ranges defined by their mean values and standard deviations ( 1@xmath32 ) . in our calculations ,",
    "the hermite integration scheme described by makino ( 1991 ) and implemented by aarseth ( 2003 ) is employed .",
    "the standard version of this direct @xmath0-body code is publicly available from the ioa website.sverre/web/pages/nbody.htm ] relative errors in the total energy for the longest integrations are as low as @xmath33 or lower .",
    "the relative error in the total angular momentum is several orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "as pointed out in de la fuente marcos & de la fuente marcos ( 2012 ) , the results from this code compare well with those from laskar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) among others .",
    "[ deviations ] shows the relative variations ( difference between the values with and without planet nine divided by the value without the external perturber ) of the values of the orbital elements @xmath5 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 of the four jovian planets ( jupiter to neptune , left to right ) for @xmath34100 myr for the nominal orbit of planet nine .",
    "these deviations are consistent with the expectations as they remain very small for a few tens of myr , growing afterwards .",
    "the average orbital evolution of the jovian planets , which is time symmetric , is not significantly altered by the presence of planet nine as described by the nominal orbit ( see above ) .",
    "+    batygin & brown ( 2016 ) used the mercury6 gravitational dynamics software package ( chambers 1999 ) to perform @xmath0-body simulations of 13 etnos subjected to the perturbation of the most massive known members of the solar system .",
    "these calculations led them to select six out of 13 etnos as largely unaffected by the presence of neptune ; these objects are ( 90377 ) sedna , 2004  vn@xmath2 , 2007  tg@xmath3 , 2010  gb@xmath35 , 2012  vp@xmath1 and 2013  rf@xmath4 .",
    "the present - day orbital properties of these objects were subsequently used to constrain and validate the resonant perturbation mechanism behind the planet nine hypothesis .",
    "however , no attempt was made to confirm that , in the presence of their favoured incarnation of the planet nine hypothesis , the orbital evolution of the six etnos remained unaffected by neptune . in the following ,",
    "we perform such tests evolving the present - day orbits of the six etnos backwards in time and into the future within the framework described above and discuss the results obtained .",
    "fienga et al . ( 2016 ) pointed out that from the perspective of the _ cassini _ residuals , the most probable orbit for the object proposed by batygin & brown ( 2016 ) could be : @xmath14  au , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath19and @xmath17 , with @xmath21 at present time .",

    "[ fienga ] that corresponds to the nominal orbits of the six etnos subjected to the action of planet nine as discussed in fienga et al .",
    "they indicate that the orbital evolution of several of the objects displayed could be more chaotic into the future than it used to be in the past .",
    "this time asymmetry suggests that , within the planet nine hypothesis , the etnos might be a transient population that evolves from relatively stable orbits into rather unstable ones . in particular",
    ", the future orbital evolution of 2004  vn@xmath2 , 2007  tg@xmath3 and 2013  rf@xmath4 is very unstable in this case .",
    "using control orbits for the etnos slightly different from the nominal ones , but within 1@xmath32 , produces similar results .",
    "the same can be said if it is assumed that planet nine is currently located at aphelion and/or that @xmath37 but leaving the values of the other orbital parameters unchanged .",

    "[ fienga ] clearly shows that the orbital evolution of several of the six etnos is eventually affected by neptune ( and other jovian planets ) as their eccentricities become close to 1 ( 2004  vn@xmath2 and 2007  tg@xmath3 ) or its semimajor axis becomes dangerously small ( 2013  rf@xmath4 ) .",

    "multiple orbit realizations of the etnos 2004  vn@xmath2 , 2007  tg@xmath3 and 2013  rf@xmath4 evolve into retrograde objects and/or are ejected from the solar system within the simulation time .",
    "this behaviour has been previously documented in simulations by gomes , soares & brasser ( 2015 ) and batygin & brown ( 2016 ) .",
    "only the orbits of ( 90377 ) sedna and 2012  vp@xmath1 remain relatively well confined in orbital parameter space in fig .",
    "[ fienga ] .",
    "however , longer integrations ( not shown ) indicate that , for this particular orbit , the six etnos could be ejected from the solar system within 1.5 gyr from now .",
    "it is clear that , in general , the assumption made by batygin & brown ( 2016 ) that the singled out etnos were largely unaffected by the presence of neptune breaks up relatively rapidly once the perturbation from planet nine is taken into account .",
    "this is to be expected within the context of an apsidal anti - alignment scenario because the average value of @xmath38 using this hypothetical orbit and the data from table [ 6etnos] is nearly 153 , relatively far from the critical value of 180 .",
    "so the question is , how is the orbital evolution of the etnos affected if we enforce the @xmath39 condition ?",

    "co - orbital motion is possible at high eccentricity ( see e.g. namouni , christou & murray 1999 ) .",
    "the overall orbital evolution of the six etnos under this incarnation of planet nine is more stable than that in fig .",
    "[ fienga ] , but less stable than the one associated with orbit a ( see fig .",

    "the resonant coupling mechanism described in batygin & brown ( 2016 ) , with some fine tuning , can shepherd some etnos and explain their unusual orbital patterns .",
    "it can also create dynamical pathways that may deliver objects to high inclination or even retrograde orbits , and place etnos within kozai resonances .",

    "kozai behaviour is a by - product of mean motion resonances .",
    "innanen et al . (",
    "1997 ) and tanikawa & ito ( 2007 ) performed numerical experiments to measure the strength of the gravitational coupling among the known planets against external perturbation .",
    "they concluded that , for relatively short integrations , the two subsystems pointed out above were able to absorb efficiently a perturbation several orders of magnitude stronger than that of a putative planet nine .",
    "this result can be used to guess the answer to the question , is planet nine alone or are there more ?",
    "planet nine , if it exists , moves in an elongated orbit that may be vulnerable to long - term secular perturbations resulting from the galactic tide or discrete events like close encounters with passing stars . in this context",
    ", a lone planet nine may not be able to survive in its present orbit for the age of the solar system ( see li & adams 2016 ) , but a planet within a planetary group has better chances to be long - term stable .",
    "therefore , if planet nine exists , it is probably not alone ; planets similar to uranus or neptune ( super - earths ) may also form at 125750 au from the sun ( kenyon & bromley 2015 , 2016 ) .    in this letter , we have explored the dynamical impact of the planet nine scenario on the six etnos originally linked to the hypothesis proposed by batygin & brown ( 2016 ) .",
