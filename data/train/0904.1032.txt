    "nowadays cosmology presents explosive activity which is principally due to theoretical developments and accurate astronomical data . in this context , cosmology allows to use astrophysics to perform tests of fundamental theories , otherwise inaccessible to terrestrial accelerators . in order to do this task",
    "it is necessary to perform a study about how the universe evolves during its different periods .",
    "in fact , this study leads to considering at some stage in the early universe an inflationary phase , which is to date the most compelling solution to many long - standing problems of the big bang model ( horizon , flatness , monopoles , etc . )",
    "@xcite .",
    "the source of inflation is a scalar field ( the inflaton field ) which plays an important role in providing a causal interpretation of the origin of the observed anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and also the distribution of large scale structures @xcite .",
    "the identity of this scalar field may be found by considering one of the extensions of the standard model of particle physics based on grand unified theories , supergravity , or string theory .    in what concerns the scalar inflaton field ,",
    "its dynamics usually is determined by the klein - gordon action .",
    "however , more recently , and motivated by string theory , it is extremely natural to consider other nonstandard scalar field action . in this context , the deep interplay between small - scale nonperturbative string theory and large - scale braneworld scenarios has aroused interest in a tachyon field as an inflationary mechanism , especially in the dirac - born - infeld action formulation as a description of the d - brane action@xcite . here , rolling tachyon matter",
    "is associated with unstable d - branes .",
    "the decay of these d - branes produces a pressureless gas with finite energy density that resembles classical dust .",
    "cosmological implications of this rolling tachyon were first studied by gibbons@xcite , and in this context it is quite natural to consider scenarios in which inflation is driven by the rolling tachyon field . in recent years",
    "the possibility of an inflationary phase described by the potential of a tachyon field has been considered in a quite large diversity of topics@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , string / m - theory suggests that in order to have a ghost - free action high order curvature , invariant corrections to the einstein - hilbert action must be proportional to the gauss - bonnet ( gb ) term@xcite .",
    "gb terms arise naturally as the leading order of the @xmath0 expansion to the low - energy string effective action , where @xmath0 is the inverse string tension@xcite .",
    "this kind of theory has been applied to possible resolution of the initial singularity problem@xcite , to the study of black - hole solutions@xcite , and accelerated cosmological solutions@xcite . in particular , very recently , it has been found that for a dark energy model the gb interaction in four dimensions with a dynamical dilatonic scalar field coupling leads to a solution of the form @xmath1@xcite . here",
    ", the constant @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is a constant .",
    "therefore , we may argument that intermediate inflation comes from an effective theory at a low dimension of a more fundamental string theory .    in general",
    ", in the context of inflation we have the particular scenario of  intermediate inflation ",
    ", in which the scale factor evolves as @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the expansion of the universe is slower than standard de- sitter inflation ( @xmath8 ) , but faster than power law inflation ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the intermediate inflationary model was introduced as an exact solution for a particular scalar field potential of the type @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a free parameter@xcite . with this sort of potential , and with @xmath12 , it is possible in the slow - roll approximation to have a spectrum of density perturbations , which presents a scale - invariant spectral index @xmath13 , i.e. , the so - called harrizon - zeldovich spectrum of density perturbations , provided @xmath11 takes the value of 2/3@xcite . even though this kind of spectrum is disfavored by the current wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data@xcite , the inclusion of tensor perturbations , which could be present at some point by inflation and parametrized by the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath14 , the conclusion that @xmath15 is allowed providing that the value of @xmath14 is significantly nonzero@xcite . in fact , in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the combination @xmath13 , and @xmath16 is given by a version of the intermediate inflation in which the scale factor varies as @xmath17 within the slow - roll approximation .    in this paper",
    "we would like to study intermediate inflationary universe model in which a tachyon field theory is taken into account .",
    "we will solve the friedmann and tachyon field equations for an intermediate expansion of the scale factor and results will be compared with those obtained in the same situation , but where a standard scalar field is considered .",
    "we should note that this sort of problem has been studied in the literature@xcite . here , in this paper we would like to go further and thus constraint the parameters of our model by taking into account the wmap 3 and 5 yr data .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : the next section presents a short review of the tachyonic - intermediate inflationary phase .",
    "section [ sectp ] deals with the calculations of cosmological perturbations in general term . finally , in sect.[conclu ] we conclude with our finding .",
    "we begin by writing the friedmann equation for a flat universe and the conservation equation , @xmath18 and @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the hubble parameter , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 represents the planck mass ) and the dots mean derivatives with respect to the cosmological time @xmath23 .",
    "for convenience we will use units in which @xmath24 . for a tachyonic field",
    "the energy density and the pressure are given by @xmath25 respectively . here",
    "@xmath26 is the tachyonic scalar field and @xmath27 its scalar potential , which satisfies @xmath28 , and @xmath29 , characteristic of any tachyon field potential@xcite .    from eqs.([friedmann ] ) and ( [ conservation ] ) we get for the velocity of the tachyonic scalar field , and its evolution equation becomes    @xmath30    and @xmath31 respectively . here , @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , in intermediate inflation it is assumed that the scale factor follows the law @xmath33 where @xmath34 has the dimension of @xmath35 .",
    "note that this assumption immediately determines the behavior of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , as we can see from eqs.([phi ] ) and ( [ v ] ) .",

    "actually , this coincidence has already been noted in ref.@xcite .",

    "the scalar spectral index @xmath95 , for @xmath112 , is given by @xmath116 from eq.([eta ] ) this expression is equivalent to @xmath117    using that @xmath63 it is obtained from the condition @xmath118 ( at the beginning of inflation ) , then eq.([ns4 ] ) can be re - expressed in terms of the number of e - folding @xmath62 , resulting in @xmath119 note that , does a value does not exist for @xmath11 in which @xmath13 , in contrast with the standard case @xcite ( which occurs for @xmath120 ) .",
