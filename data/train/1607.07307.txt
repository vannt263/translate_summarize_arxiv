    "investigating diffusion processes is a subject of broad and current interest @xcite . especially important is to comprehend their dynamical behavior and understand which factors are significant for the expansion .",
    "this information may turn out to be critical for epidemiologists in preventing contagious diseases and establishing health policies .",
    "applications of dynamical models reach far beyond that . in computer science , they describe propagation of data packets or malicious software and help to design routing protocols and more robust networks @xcite .",
    "information search and retrieval are relevant to the dynamics of spreading , as well . in engineering ,",
    "similar models are used and analyzed in order to plan efficient power grids and regulate energy policies as well as study conductivity and flow through porous materials @xcite .",
    "sociologists in the same terms describe phenomena like opinion dynamics , emergence of consensus , and diffusion of innovations @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", especially considerable attention has been drawn to the @xmath0-voter model @xcite which was originally proposed by castellano et al .",
    "@xcite and later altered by nyczka et al . @xcite .",
    "its modified version represents opinion dynamics under two types of social response : conformity and independence @xcite .",
    "although widely exploited in sociophysics , it also finds application in computational economics as an underling mechanism of consumers decision making process , sometimes with slight modifications .",
    "recently , it was adopted in the analysis of designing marketing strategies and pricing innovative commodities @xcite .",
    "al @xcite , on the other hand , proposed similar agent - based model with @xmath0-voter dynamics in order to explain a behavioral gap between people s intentions and practices .",
    "although researchers associate the @xmath0-voter model with opinion dynamics , it is frequently allocated on simple topologies like complete graphs or regular lattices @xcite despite the fact that social networks are regarded as complex structures @xcite . and even if some studies consider irregularities and randomness in modelling pairwise relations between agents , they focus primarily on simulation results , and only minority proposes analytical approach , as well @xcite . thus , in this paper , we carry out a mathematical analysis into the problem , and we clearly establish a connection between @xmath0-voter dynamics and complex networks . the system is studied by using pair approximation which was previously employed only to the linear voter model @xcite and has not been applied before to the nonlinear one .",
    "moreover , the paper refers to the @xmath0-voter dynamics with stochastic noise , sociologically interpreted as independence , for which analytical results are known only in the case of a complete graph @xcite .",
    "the obtained approximation is validated on several structures like random regular ( rr ) , erds - rnyi ( er ) , barabsi - albert ( ba ) , and watts - strogatz ( ws ) networks by carrying out monte carlo simulations .",
    "we also show that in the limiting case our prediction coincides with the solution for a complete graph .",
    "we consider an arbitrary network of the size @xmath1 .",
    "each vertex is associated with one autonomous agent characterized by a binary variable @xmath2 . in every elementary time step ,",
    "we pick at random an agent and a group of influence comprised of @xmath0 its randomly selected neighbors .",
    "the group is called @xmath0-panel , and its potential members are determined by the network topology . with probability @xmath3 ,",
    "the chosen agent acts independently and adopts the opposite opinion or preserves the old one with equal chances .",
    "otherwise , with probability @xmath4 , it behaves like a conformist and embraces the viewpoint of @xmath0-panel , but only if the group is unanimous , that is to say , all @xmath0 individuals have the same state .",
    "drawing agents occurs without repetition so that above definition of the model is identical as in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , now we extend underlying topologies to more complex structures than complete graphs .",
    "one of macroscopic quantities , which is easily traceable and can characterize our system is a concentration or a fraction of up spins @xmath5 it can be interpreted as a probability of finding an agent with a positive opinion , namely @xmath6 .",
    "analogously , we can define a concentration of down spins @xmath7 since randomly choosing an up - spin and a down - spin are complementary events , we have @xmath8 . for a notation simplicity , @xmath9 without index also refers to @xmath10 . finally , we are also interested in interfaces between any two connected agents . in statistical physics ,",
    "a bond is said to be active if it links two spins with opposite values @xcite .",
    "herein we adopt the same idea and define a concentration of active bonds as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the average degree of the network , and @xmath13 is an indicator function specified on a set of edges @xmath14 .    let us consider an agent placed on a vertex which has @xmath15 neighbors and @xmath16 active bonds attached . the flipping probability @xcite , that is to say , the probability that an agent changes its opinion to the opposite one , is a function of active bonds number @xmath16 connected to agent s node .",
    "since we do not allow repetition of chosen agents in a @xmath0-panel , this probability takes the following form : @xmath17    as we mentioned before , the probability of choosing an agent with a positive opinion from the system @xmath18 , or for the simplicity @xmath19 , is equal to up spins concentration @xmath20 the same holds for choosing an agent with a negative opinion @xmath21 the concentration of active bonds , on the other hand , possesses the information about mutual relations between agents .",
    "if we think of choosing an active bond as a consecutive selection of two connected nodes , two events may occur .",
    "firstly , we select an up - spin and then a down - spin @xmath22 , or the other way around , at the beginning , we encounter a down - spin and after an up - spin @xmath23 . as a consequence ,",
    "one can write the following equation @xmath24 moreover , there is the same amount of connections between @xmath25 and @xmath26 because they share the same edge .",
    "this implies that @xmath27 and together with eq .",
    "( [ eq : bprob ] ) , we obtain @xmath28 having above result , calculating conditional probabilities is straightforward .",
    "we use the following notation @xmath29 to denote the probability of selecting a down - spin given we have already picked an up - spin and so on for other spin combinations : @xmath30 in order to simplify further notation we designate by @xmath31 and by @xmath32 .",
    "in an elementary time step , only a single agent may change his opinion .",
    "this event affects concentration of active bonds as well as concentration of up spins .",
    "let us consider first the fraction of agents with a positive attitude .",
    "there are three possible scenarios .",
    "the amount of up spins may increase by @xmath33 , decrease by @xmath33 , or remain at the same level .",
    "so a flip corresponds to an elementary change in @xmath9 by @xmath34 .",
    "following @xcite , we denote probabilities of these changes by @xmath35 knowing above transition probabilities , we are able to write down the rate equation @xcite which describes the dynamics of up spins concentration @xmath36 when we deal with large systems @xmath37 , in particular , when @xmath38 , the time interval tends to zero @xmath39 . in such a case eq .",
    "( [ eq : cdisc ] ) takes continuous form @xmath40 usually , the explicit formulas for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are derived based on the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) as in @xcite .",
    "this theory postulates agents homogeneity in order to reduce the complexity of a problem . in more detail , it neglects all fluctuations in a system so that a local concentration is equal to the global , average one .",
    "this approach gives prefect results on a complete graph where , indeed , our system is homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "however , on more complicated structures , not taking into account fluctuations gives overestimated results .",
    "herein , we adopt the improved method called the pair approximation ( pa ) @xcite which also considers dynamical correlations between the nearest neighbors ; therefore , it delivers more precise local description of a system than ordinary mean - filed approach .",
    "this additional information is acquired from the active bond concentration through conditional probabilities derived before . in pa",
    ", we assume that states of a chosen agent s neighbors are independent of each other ; thus , @xmath43 and @xmath29 remain the same for all spins in the panel .",
    "this , however , may not be true in general , especially when a network is highly clustered .",
    "furthermore , we postulate no degree correlations , i.e. , we neglect all dependencies between node degree and finding a spin in a given position or a link in a given state .",
    "so no matter what is the value of @xmath15 for a picked vertex , we use the same @xmath9 and @xmath44 which characterize all nodes .",
    "let us derive transition probabilities relying on pa .",
    "the reasoning for @xmath41 is following .",
    "the concentration of up spins has a chance to increase only if an agent with negative attitude is picked .",
    "this event happens with probability @xmath45 .",
    "then an agent is submitted to either conformity or independence . in the former case ,",
    "a unanimous @xmath0-panel of up spins @xmath46 must be gathered . choosing each of them is @xmath47 probable since we already know the opinion of the considered agent . in the latter case ,",
    "a flip occurs with probability @xmath48 .",
    "analogical inference might be applied to @xmath42 . as a result",
    "we obtain @xmath49,\\\\      \\gamma^- & = c\\left[(1-p)\\theta_\\uparrow^q+\\frac{p}{2}\\right ] .",
    "\\end{split } \\label{eq : gammas}\\ ] ] nevertheless , we are still not able to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : partialc ] ) without knowing the form of @xmath44 which is necessary for the conditional probabilities @xmath32 and @xmath31 .    for the concentration of active bonds",
    ", we can conduct similar calculations and also find its rate equation , following the reasoning of @xcite .",
    "this time , a single flip refers to an elementary change in @xmath44 by @xmath50 dependent on agent s node degree and number of already active edges @xmath16 attached to this vertex .",
    "locally , after a flip , links which were inactive become active and oppositely . remembering that the total amount of edges in a network equals @xmath51 , we obtain @xmath52 where @xmath16 ranges from @xmath53 to @xmath15 .",
    "let us explicitly write down the overall likeliness of changing an agent s opinion which is just a sum of transition probabilities @xmath54 in the following form @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the conditional probability of a flip given that the chosen spin is in a state , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : gammas ] ) . furthermore ,",
    "using our assumption that the node degree is independent of agent s opinion and applying the law of total probability , the following equation is obtained @xmath57 among all @xmath15 edges attached to the picked vertex , @xmath16 of them might be active where @xmath58 .",
    "the probability of selecting one of them is @xmath59 , and since we treat these events as independent , picking @xmath16 of active bonds is binomially distributed @xmath60 .",
    "it results in @xmath61 where under @xmath62 we understand the opposite state to @xmath63 .",
    "finally , we obtain the formula in which the conditional probability of a flip @xmath64 is used given the number of active bonds , the chosen agent s opinion , and the node degree .",
    "but this , in fact , is the flipping probability @xmath65 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : flipprob ] ) .",
    "now , having this partition we know the impact of elementary shifts in @xmath44 for different events .",
    "each flip which is @xmath65 probable causes a change in the overall active bonds concentration @xmath66 by @xmath50 ; thus , combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : part1]-[eq : part3 ] ) we get @xmath67 connecting this result with eq .",
    "( [ eq : smaldeltab ] ) and the fact that @xmath68 , the following expression is obtained @xmath69 of course , once again we can take a limit @xmath70 and attain the differential form . altogether",
    ", we obtain a system of two differential equations which can be solved simultaneously .",
    "the first for up spins and the second one for active bonds concentration :    @xmath71    the above result is general and can be applied to other dynamical models from the same class . then the forms of transition and flipping probabilities will alter , but eq .",
    "( [ eq : system ] ) will remain unchanged .",
    "let us simplify the formula for the active bonds concentration in the above system of equations for the @xmath0-voter model .",
    "first , notice that the flipping probability can be presented in the equivalent form @xmath72 now , we consider only the interior sum over active bonds  @xmath16 in eq .",

    "the first and the third term we have to compute explicitly ; note that here we start addition from @xmath0 , not @xmath53 .",

    "as seen , the system quickly reaches a steady point and fluctuates around a constant values of @xmath9 and @xmath44 . however , under certain parameters , there are more stationary states , and occasionally , deviations are strong enough to enforce spontaneous transitions between them . along with growing system size ,",

    "[ fig : distphasetr ] , we can see that the final state depends on the initial conditions .",
    "this reliance is called hysteresis , and it is one of the characteristic features of discontinuous phase transitions .",
    "all these examined structures have in common very low clustering coefficient @xmath104 which is required in the pair approximation .",
    "the impact of @xmath104 on the model behavior is especially evident for watts - strogatz networks where we can adjust its value by changing the rewriting probability @xmath105 .",
    "note that altering @xmath105 influences only the average clustering coefficient and not the average degree which remains constant .",
    "therefore , pa gives one solution for all rewriting probabilities what is at odds with simulations , see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagws ] .",

    "additionally , we can calculate exactly the critical point @xmath85 for a continuous phase transition .",
    "it is such a value of independence for which a system changes its state from ordered ( @xmath106 ) to disordered one ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "therefore , it is enough to investigate the limiting behavior of @xmath103 when the up spins concentration approaches @xmath48 , so calculate the following limit @xmath107 using previously derived eqs .",
    "( [ eq : peq ] ) and ( [ eq : bdepc ] ) together with lhpital s rule , we obtain @xmath108 note that in the case of a discontinuous phase transition ( @xmath109 ) , we can also use the above formula , but it will correspond to @xmath89 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : criticalpoint ] ) , we see that the critical level of independence rises together with the growing average degree of a network . for large @xmath12",
    ", we can approximate its value by @xmath110 what is the result for a complete graph obtained in @xcite by mfa .",
    "we aimed to investigate the influence of complex networks on the @xmath0-voter dynamics with stochastic noise .",
    "we put particular emphasis on the analytical approach .",
    "the above model was extensively studied on several complex structures including erds - rnyi , barabsi - albert , and watts - strogatz networks .",
    "we also considered its behavior on a random regular and a complete graph as a benchmark .",
    "analytical calculations were supported with a series of monte carlo simulations which allowed us to validate our results .",

    "all examined cases we demonstrated the superiority of the former method over the other .",
    "moreover , our study indicates that for poorly clustered networks pair approximation may provide very accurate description .",
    "we investigated the time evolution of the model and derived analytical formula for the stationary points as well as we analyzed the influence of the system size on fluctuations .",
    "two types of phase transitions were identified , and we determined the critical level of independence which separates ordered and disordered states .    on the basis of our analytical and experimental results , we revealed and highlighted the crucial role of the average node degree in predicting the model behavior .",
    "along with increasing value of @xmath12 , the phase diagram shifts towards higher values of independence .",
    "consequently , it results in higher critical point .",
    "moreover , for large average degrees we showed that solutions established from pa converge to those from mfa . in the further studies , in order to improve the prediction accuracy for networks with the average degree close to @xmath0 , one could consider applying the heterogeneous pair approximation @xcite which also takes into account degree correlations .",
