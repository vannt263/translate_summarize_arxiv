    "there has been much interest recently in the thermonuclear rate of the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction at temperatures of type i x - ray bursts @xcite . because of the high temperatures of several giga - kelvin ( in usual notation : @xmath5 ) , the reaction rate is essentially defined by the cross section at energies between 1 and 3mev .",

    "( strictly speaking , the reaction rate is obtained after multiplying @xmath16@xmath17  with the densities of the reaction partners and integration over space . nevertheless , the quantity @xmath16@xmath17  is usually called `` reaction rate '' .",

    "[ fig : level ] for illustration purposes . because of the positive @xmath18-value of this reaction , the available energy in the @xmath3na+@xmath2 channel is much higher than in the @xmath0ne+@xmath1  channel .",

    "hence , the proton partial width is much larger compared to the @xmath1-particle partial width for all relevant resonances , @xmath21 , and the @xmath22-ray partial width , @xmath23 , is very small compared to the total width , @xmath24 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the reaction rate can be calculated using the narrow resonance formalism @xcite : @xmath25 with the reduced mass , @xmath26 , in units of amu , the resonance energies , @xmath27 , in mev , and the resonance strengths , @xmath28 , in mev . in this work ,",

    "resonance energies are derived from the measured excitation energies @xcite by using @xmath32 , with the @xmath1-particle binding energy in the @xmath7 mg compound nucleus given by @xmath33  kev @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath34 does not significantly affect the uncertainty of the reaction rate .",

    "( [ eq : strength ] ) .",

    "the laboratory measurement provides only the partial @xmath3na@xmath43(@xmath2,@xmath1)@xmath0ne@xmath43 cross section .",
    "this statement holds exactly for low proton energies below 4.5mev where the reaction channel to the first excited state in @xmath0ne is closed .",
    "but also at slightly higher energies this statement holds approximately because the coulomb barrier strongly prefers the ground state channel , and no event for the first excited state has been detected in the experiment of salter _",
    "_ @xcite .    from the above considerations",
    "we may conclude that a measurement of the reverse @xmath3na(@xmath2,@xmath1)@xmath0ne reaction only provides the @xmath0ne@xmath43(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na@xmath43 cross section using the reciprocity theorem of nuclear reactions .",
    "a reaction rate which is determined from this ground state to ground state cross section is only a lower limit for the stellar rate of the forward @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction which populates the ground state and low - lying states of @xmath3na .",
    "for completeness we mention that _ stellar _ reaction rates of forward and reverse reactions are directly related by detailed balance . however",
    ", this general relation does not hold for rates which are determined from laboratory cross sections .",
    "the thermonuclear rate of the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath2)@xmath3na reaction covers many orders of magnitude in the relavant temperature range .",
    "therefore , it is helpful to compare the present results to a reference rate . for the latter we adopt the rate of ref .",

    "the partial widths @xmath38 of @xmath7 mg levels in the relevant energy window have not been measured directly yet .",

    "the assumption of mirror symmetry in the wave functions of corresponding @xmath7 mg and @xmath7ne levels yields for the dimensionless reduced widths @xmath44 equation  ( [ eq : reduced ] ) is typically fulfilled for states with a strong @xmath1-cluster component in the wave function ( i.e. , for a large value of @xmath45 ) , whereas significant discrepancies have been found for mirror states with very small @xmath45 values @xcite .    here",
    "we follow the procedure for estimating @xmath38 in @xmath7 mg that was outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , but implement several improvements .",
    "we group the astrophysically important @xmath7 mg levels , listed in refs .",
    "@xcite into four different categories , which will be discussed below in more detail .",

    "absolute @xmath38 values can be determined from @xmath0o(@xmath1,@xmath22)@xmath7ne reaction data for a few low - lying resonances @xcite and from resonant @xmath0o(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0o elastic scattering at higher energies @xcite . however",
    ", the latter do not play a significant role in the determination of @xmath16@xmath17   because of the relatively high energies . for states in this category",
    "a , we assign an uncertainty of a factor of two to the derived partial widths , @xmath38 , in @xmath7 mg .",
    "the corresponding @xmath38 values in @xmath7ne are typically known with much smaller uncertainties .",
    "the factor of two uncertainty reflects the assumption of mirror symmetry of the wave functions in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reduced ] ) .",
    "_ category b _ consists of a few high - lying states , corresponding to resonance energies above 3.5 mev , with known @xmath38 values in the @xmath7ne mirror nucleus from resonant @xmath0o(@xmath1,@xmath1)@xmath0o elastic scattering @xcite .",
    "because of their high resonance energy , the partial widths @xmath38 in @xmath7 mg become very large , and the approximation @xmath46 does not hold anymore . in this case",
    "the resonance strengths , @xmath47 , are determined using @xmath48 where the total widths @xmath12 are taken from @xcite and the partial widths @xmath38 are calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : reduced ] ) and @xmath45 from @xcite . for states in this category",
    "we assign a resonance strength uncertainty of a factor 3 .",
    "note that these levels have practically no impact on @xmath16@xmath17  at astrophysically relevant temperatures .",
    "_ category c _ is assigned to states with known spectroscopic information from @xmath1-transfer on @xmath0o .",
    "the relevant excitation energy range was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite using the @xmath0o(@xmath49li,@xmath50)@xmath7ne reaction at @xmath51mev . because only relative spectroscopic factors are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , an absolute normalization of the transfer data has to be performed ( see below ) . for states in this category ,",
    "we assign a resonance strength uncertainty of a factor 3 , which is a combined uncertainty of the assumption of mirror symmetry in eq .",
    "( [ eq : reduced ] ) and the model dependence introduced by deriving @xmath38 from @xmath1-transfer . the estimate of a factor of two uncertainty for the assumption of mirror symmetry was already explained for the category a states above .",
    "we estimate another factor of two uncertainty for the model dependence of the determination of reduced widths @xmath45 and absolute partial widths @xmath38 from transfer . combining both uncertainty factors using quadratic error propagation for lognormal distributions ,",
    "leads to an overall uncertainty factor of @xmath52 .    _ category d _",
    "is assigned to all of the remaining levels for which no spectroscopic information is available . as a crude estimate , matic _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite adopted for these states a reduced width that was obtained by averaging the experimental values of levels observed in transfer studies .",
    "this procedure is problematic because transfer reactions preferentially populate states with large reduced widths , @xmath45 . in other words ,",
    "states that have not been observed in transfer reactions presumably have smaller reduced widths compared to the average of the detected states .",
    "therefore , the procedure applied by ref .",
    "@xcite significantly overestimates the actual dimensionless reduced width , @xmath45 , and thus the @xmath1-particle partial width , @xmath38 . in this work ,",
    "we randomly sample @xmath45 for all states in category d from a porter - thomas distribution with a mean reduced width of @xmath53 .",

    "@xcite for nuclei with slightly larger mass numbers @xmath54 . in the latter work ,",
    "@xmath55 was found with a trend to increasing values for smaller mass numbers .",
    "the value of @xmath53 used in the present work leads to a significantly reduced reaction rate compared to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , as shown below .",
    "we also find that the uncertainty in this value has only a minor impact on the total rate .",
    "a further uncertainty for @xmath16@xmath17  arises from only tentative @xmath13 assignments for these category d states without detailed spectroscopic information .",
    "this will be discussed later ( see sect .  [ sec : mc ] ) .",
    "the partial width @xmath38 is calculated from the single - particle ( @xmath56 ) limit according to @xmath57 where @xmath58 is computed using a radius of @xmath59 , with @xmath60fm .",
    "this value of the radius parameter is chosen for consistency with ref .",
    "the choice of @xmath61 has only a small influence on the calculated @xmath38 values in @xmath7 mg because the same @xmath61 has been used in the determination of @xmath62 from @xmath63 and in the determination of @xmath64 from @xmath65 .",
    "first , for some states very small reduced widths , on the order of @xmath66 , were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , which were derived from @xmath0o(@xmath1,@xmath22)@xmath7ne capture data @xcite .",
    "however , for these resonances the neutron channel is also open , and it is not possible to derive @xmath38 from the measured ( @xmath1,@xmath22 )  resonance strength , @xmath67 , because the total width , @xmath12 , may be dominated by the neutron width , @xmath68 .",
    "we have assigned these states either to category c or category d , depending on whether reduced widths were measured in the transfer experiment @xcite .",
