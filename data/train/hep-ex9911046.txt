    "the perturbative qcd approach to describing the inclusive energy spectra , via the modified leading log approximation ( mlla ) in conjunction with local parton hadron duality ( lphd ) , has been very successful in both @xmath0 annihilation and deep inelastic scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "using lphd , the non - perturbative effects of such distributions are reduced to a simple factor of normalisation that relates the hadronic distributions to the partonic ones .",
    "perturbative features of these distributions are calculated by mlla which accounts for both the double and single logarithmic effects .",
    "the mlla approach has two free parameters : a running strong coupling , governed by a qcd scale @xmath1 and an energy cut - off , @xmath2 below which the parton evolution is truncated .",
    "the mlla evolution equation allow the parton spectra for the logarithmic scaled energy spectra , @xmath3 to be calculated  @xcite .",
    "the variable @xmath4 is defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the original energy of the jet and @xmath7 is the parton s energy . the cut - off",
    ", @xmath2 bounds the parton energy , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the transverse energy of the decay products in the jet evolution . in order to reconstruct the @xmath4 distributions",
    "one has to perform the inverse mellin transformation :    @xmath10    where the integral runs parallel to the imaginary axis on the right of all singularities in the complex @xmath11plane , @xmath12 and @xmath13    the mellin - transformed distributions , @xmath14 can be expressed  @xcite in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions , @xmath15 :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 in addition @xmath18 and @xmath19 are defined as :    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the number of colours , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the number of flavours and @xmath24    equation  [ eqn : mlla ] is then calculated using a numerical integration in the complex @xmath11plane .",
    "the current region in the @xmath25 breit frame is analogous to a single hemisphere of @xmath0 annihilation . in @xmath26 annihilation",
    "the two quarks are produced with equal and opposite momenta , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the positron - electron centre of mass energy .",
    "the fragmentation of these quarks can be compared to that of the quark struck from the proton ; this quark has an outgoing momentum @xmath29 in the breit frame , where @xmath30 is the negative square of the four - momentum of the virtual exchanged boson in dis . in the direction of this",
    "struck quark the scaled momentum spectra of the particles are expected by mlla  @xcite to have a dependence on @xmath31 similar to that observed in  annihilation at energy @xmath32 with no bjorken-@xmath33 dependence .",
    "the ariadne monte carlo generator  @xcite is based on the colour dipole model , cdm  @xcite . in the cdm , all gluon emissions constituting the qcd cascade start as radiation from the colour dipole formed between the quark and the anti - quark in the case of @xmath0 annihilation or the struck quark and the proton remnant in the case of dis .",
    "all subsequent radiation arises from independent colour dipoles formed either from @xmath34 pairs or softer gluons radiated by the previously produced gluons . in the dis scenario ,",
    "the proton remnant is treated as an extended object which results in a suppression of radiation  @xcite , generally in the proton direction .",
    "in addition the struck quark is treated as extended , as the photon only probes it to a distance inversely proportional to the transferred momentum . treating the remnant and the struck quark as extended objects , rather than point like , results in a reduction in the available phase space for gluon radiation in dis .",
    "the qcd cascade in ariadne is governed by a number of parameters in the monte carlo models .",
    "two of the most important are the qcd scale , @xmath1 ( para(1 ) ) and the parameter that determines the @xmath9 cut off for the shower ( para(3 ) ) .",
    "an additional parameter , para(28 ) , also allows the user to bound the lower energy of the emitted parton as well . for this study",
    "ariadne version 4.10 has been used .",
    "before investigating the evolution of the shower in dis , the evolution in the simpler case of @xmath35 pair production in @xmath0 annihilation was studied .",
    "the spectra for both mlla and ariadne were generated with a @xmath36 mev and a cut - off @xmath37 below @xmath38 there are instabilities in the numerical integration of equation  [ eqn : mlla ] so all subsequent comparisons are for @xmath39 except for an overall normalisation discrepancy ( a factor of 1.4 greater parton multiplicity in ariadne ) the @xmath4 spectra are in very good agreement as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ee ] .",
    "this normalisation discrepancy is constant , independent of the @xmath40 at which the events were generated at .",
    "there is a slight tendency for the mlla calculation to fall off quicker at large values of @xmath4 than the ariadne predictions .",
    ". the ( @xmath33,@xmath31 ) analysis bins . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     using lepto  @xcite to generate the electroweak cross section and colour flow configuration for dis , ariadne was then used to generate the subsequent qcd cascade .",
    "the event was boosted to the breit frame and those partons in the current fragmentation region selected .",
    "the dis events were generated with fixed kinematics that are accessible in the hera regime .",
    "the corresponding value of bjorken-@xmath33 with @xmath31 are shown in table  [ tab : bins ] . using the same values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 that was used for the @xmath0 annihilation study ,",
    "the mlla prediction is again compared to the ariadne generated spectra .",
    "figure  [ fig : dis ] shows the default version of ariadne for dis compared to the mlla predictions . as @xmath30 increases the discrepancy between ariadne and the mlla calculations becomes more pronounced .",
    "the @xmath4 distribution of ariadne peaks at higher values than the mlla calculation .",
    "in addition , the mlla calculations are narrower than the ariadne predictions . again",
    "the parton multiplicity of the two distributions are different . unlike the @xmath0 situatuion this normalisation factor seems to exhibit a @xmath31 dependence . at low @xmath31",
    "the height of the peak for ariadne compared to mlla is a factor of 1.1 higher whilst in the highest @xmath31 bin it is 1.1 lower .    in the default ariadne , the mechanism for soft suppression of radiation due to",
    "the extended source of the proton remnant results in a suppression of radiation in the current region of the breit frame at high @xmath43 figure  [ fig : dis_mhar ] shows the high @xmath30 modified version of ariadne  @xcite for dis , where this suppression in the current region is removed , compared to the mlla predictions .",
    "as expected , this modification to ariadne leads to a much better agreement between the mlla calculations and ariadne .",
    "the situation with the parton multiplcity is similar .",
    "the @xmath44dependence of the ratio of the peak heights is less than the default ariadne , with ariadne being a factor @xmath45 higher .    in both options of the ariadne program",
    "there are discrepancies evident in the lower @xmath46 bins compared to the mlla predictions .",
    "one possible explaination of this discrepancy is given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it shown that high @xmath47 emissions in dis can lead to the situation where the current region of the breit frame is depopulated .",
    "the qcd cascade as implemented in the ariadne monte carlo program is in good agreement with the shape of the mlla prediction in the simple scenario of @xmath35 production in @xmath0 annihilation . in the more complex situation of dis",
    "the agreement is not as good , unless account is taken of the additional suppression introduced into the model in the current fragmentation region caused by the suppression of phase space due to the extended nature of the proton remnant ."
