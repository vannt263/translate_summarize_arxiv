    "cygnus x-1 was the first object to be classified as an x - ray binary system , and also the first to be recognized as a black hole , via optical radial velocity measurements ( webster & murdin , 1971 ; bolton , 1972 ) . correlated x - ray and radio intensity variations led to the identification of `` x - ray states ''  periods of high x - ray intensity and spectral softness , or low x - ray intensity and spectral hardness  in cygnus x-1 ( tananbaum et al .",
    "since then , states have become an essential part of how galactic black holes are discussed and understood ( for reviews , see tanaka & lewin 1995 and done 2001 ; see also homan et al .",
    "cygnus x-1 has been active in x - rays since its discovery , and presently is the only known persistent galactic black hole system with a high mass companion ( an o9.7 iab supergiant ; gies et al .",
    "1982 , 1986 ) .",
    "the black hole mass is dynamically constrained to a lower limit of @xmath9 ( paczyski 1974 ) ; herrero et al .",
    "( 1995 ) suggest that the most probable mass is @xmath10 .    the bright , persistent nature of cygnus x-1 , its constrained inclination ( @xmath11 , gies & bolton 1986 ) , modest distance ( 2.5  kpc , bregman et al . 1973 ) , and state transitions have made it a favorite source for observers and theorists . in particular , it is a testbed for models aiming to describe links between states and accretion flow geometries , and how these are related to the mass accretion rate ( @xmath12 ) . in general ,",
    "`` high / soft '' states are associated with high @xmath12 , and `` low / hard '' states are associated with low @xmath12 .",
    "state identifications usually also rely upon fast x - ray variability analysis .",
    "a variety of models connecting states and the accretion geometry have performed well , but two show particular promise while making very different predictions .",
    "esin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have described the behavior of cygnus x-1 in terms of an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) .",
    "this model predicts that when @xmath12 is relatively high , the disk may extend to the marginally stable orbit ( the high / soft state ) .",
    "when @xmath12 is lower , the disk is recessed , and the inner region is a hot , quasi - spherical , optically - thin adaf .",
    "in contrast , young et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have described the behavior of cygnus x-1 in terms of a disk which always extends to the marginally stable orbit but with a changing surface ionization that determines the x - ray state .",
    "fe  k@xmath8 emission lines may trace bulk velocities , temperatures , and even strong gravitational effects .",
    "therefore , such lines may serve as tools for placing observational constraints on accretion flow models . in some seyfert galaxies ,",
    "characteristic broad ( sometimes double - peaked ) fe  k@xmath8 emission lines have demonstrated the presence of an accretion disk down to the innermost stable circular orbit around the central black hole ( see , e.g. weaver , gelbord , & yaqoob 2001 ) . in galactic black holes ,",
    "line profiles are often less distinct ; among these systems , the lines observed in cygnus x-1 are among the strongest .",
    "barr , white , and page ( 1985 ) discovered the broad fe  k@xmath8 line ( e@xmath136.2  kev , fwhm@xmath131.2  kev , w@xmath13120  ev ) in an _ exosat _ spectrum of cygnus x-1 .",
    "this measured centroid energy was slightly lower than the neutral value of 6.40  kev ( kaastra & mewe 1993 ) .",
    "because such features are broad and relatively weak compared to lines in seyfert galaxies , one might worry that the profiles are artifacts of poor continuum models or poor instrumental response .",
    "however , an fe  k@xmath8 line has been required to obtain statistically acceptable fits to spectra observed from cygnus x-1 with a number of instruments , and for a variety of continuum models and source luminosities ( for recent _ asca _ results , see ebisawa et al .",

    "we also find that 40 - 50% of the observed x - ray flux may be reflected from the accretion disk .",
    "we observed cygnus x-1 on 2001 january 4 , from 06:03:47 to 14:49:20 ( ut )  a total of 32.1 ks . near the time of our observation , the source was flaring to some of the highest intensity levels since the 1996 `` high / soft '' state ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "we used the hetgs to disperse the incident x - ray flux , which was read - out by the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) spectroscopic array ( acis - s ) in continuous - clocking ( cc ) mode .",
    "this step was taken to reduce photon pile - up in the dispersed spectrum : the frametime in cc mode is about 2.8  ms , far less than the nominal 3.2 s in standard modes .",
    "approximately half of the incident photons are not dispersed by the hetgs .",
    "we prevented these zeroth - order photons from being read - out with a 100-column blocking filter on the acis - s3 ccd .",
    "this step was taken to avoid possible telemetry saturation and dropped ccd frames .",
    "the aimpoint was moved + 4 mm in the z - direction ( away from the read - out nodes ) to prevent possible radiation damage to the nominal aimpoint . a y - coordinate translation of @xmath22 arcseconds",
    "was used to place as much of the dispersed spectrum on the acis - s3 ccd as possible .    at the time we conducted our analysis ,",

    ", we instead use a different method to establish this relationship .",
    "we examined the locations of the neutral si absorption edges ( due to the si - based ccds ) in opposite grating orders . in raw counts",
    "spectra , we were able to determine the zeroth order position by iterating its location until the si edges appeared at the same wavelength in every order .",
    "this position was fine - tuned by fitting the most prominent absorption lines in opposite grating orders and requiring that the centroid wavelengths agree to within 0.05% uncertainty ( 0.05% is the uncertainty in the official hetgs wavelength calibration ; canizares et al .",

    "we regard this as an instrumental effect and fit it with an inverse edge ( `` @xmath23''@xmath24 ) .",
    "we also make note of two single - bin features near 1.85  kev ( 6.7 @xmath25 ) , which are also instrumental artifacts .",
    "we considered the four first - order dispersed spectra for this analysis : the two high energy grating ( heg ) and the two medium energy grating ( meg ) spectra on opposite sides of the zeroth order ( hereafter , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 orders ) .",
    "an examination of these spectra revealed that the heg  @xmath281 and meg  @xmath291 orders are less affected by the spectrum dithering off the ccd array and relative ccd gain differences than their counterparts ( due to the z - coordinate translation ) . in characterizing the broad band spectrum , we therefore considered only these grating orders , with 5% systematic flux errors added in quadrature .",
    "we exclude data affected by chip gaps . within these narrow energy ranges",
    "we included data from the heg  @xmath291 and meg  @xmath281 orders , normalized to the continuum level in the heg  @xmath281 and meg  @xmath291 orders .",
    "although we examined the spectrum at energies as low as 0.5  kev to understand how our absorption model fit the photoelectric oxygen absorption edge from the inter - stellar medium ( ism , see below ) , the meg  @xmath27 spectrum is poorly detected below 0.65  kev .",
    "therefore , we only fit the meg  @xmath27 spectrum at energies above 0.65  kev . for the same reason , we only considered energies above 1.0  kev in fitting the heg  @xmath26 spectrum . at 2.4  kev ,",
    "the meg  @xmath27 order has a chip gap , and above this energy the heg has a higher effective area ; we only consider the meg spectra for energies below 2.4  kev .",
    "the effective upper - limit to the sensitivity of the heg is 10.0  kev ; our fits to the heg  @xmath26 extended to this energy .",
    "the spectra were fit using xspec version 11.1.0 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "the meg  @xmath27 and heg  @xmath26 spectra were fit jointly , allowing an overall normalization constant to float between them ( generally , the constant indicated that the normalization agreed to within 2% or better ) .",
    "systematic errors were added to the flux values using the ftool `` grppha . ''",
    "significances quoted in this paper were calculated using the f - statistic with the `` ftest '' task within xspec .",
    "all spectral models were multiplied by a model for photoelectric absorption in the ism , with variable elemental abundances .",
    "local fits to the absorption edges agree with the absorption model reported in a previous _ chandra _ observation of cygnus  x-1 by schulz et al .",
    "we used the `` vphabs '' model in all fits with the abundances adjusted to agree with schulz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , with the minor distinction that we used the verner et al .",
    "( 1993 ) cross - sections to fit the fe  l3 edge , and that we found no evidence for the fe  l1 edge .",
    "several components of this model should be noted : the neutral hydrogen column density is @xmath30 , oxygen is 7% under - abundant ( relative to solar ) and a better fit is obtained for an edge at 0.536  kev rather than the predicted 0.532  kev , iron is 25% under - abundant , neon is 11% over - abundant , and all other edges are consistent with solar values ( relative to the abundances stated by morrison & mccammon 1983 ; @xmath31 ) and expected wavelengths .",
    "these absorption values were not allowed to vary in fits to the 0.6510.0  kev spectrum .    a wide variety of models have been used to fit the x - ray spectrum of cygnus x-1 . these range from models which attempt to describe compton - upscattering of seed photons in a corona , to more phenomenological models .",
    "often , these can not be distinguished on the basis of a goodness - of - fit statistic ( see , e.g. , nowak , wilms , & dove 2002 ) . as an example of the former",
    ", we attempted to fit the observed 0.65 - 10.0  kev spectrum with the `` comptt '' model ( titarchuk et al .",
    "we also fit the spectrum with a model consisting of the multicolor disk blackbody ( hereafter , mcd ; mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) model and a power - law .",
    "this additive model is commonly a good fit to galactic black hole spectra , and provides a standard for comparison to other sources .",
    "the breadth and strength of fe  k@xmath8 line and k edge features are sufficient to affect fits to the underlying continuum , and so we have analyzed the continuum and fe  k@xmath8 line region jointly .",
    "in figure 2 , we show the results of fitting an mcd plus power - law model to the spectra ( model 1 in table 1 , but without a narrow gaussian line component ) . a soft , thermal component",
    "is not required in some low / hard state spectra observed with other instruments . however , in this observation such a component is strongly required . in panels",
    "a and b of figure 2 , structure is apparent in the fe  k@xmath8 line region  most notably a very narrow emission line",
    ".    fits with the comptt model were not statistically acceptable .",
    "the seed photon temperature and electron temperature of the compton - upscattering corona could not be constrained ( errors on these parameters were several times larger than the values measured ) .",
    "fitting only this model , @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is the number of degrees of freedom in the fit ) .",
    "fitting an mcd component simultaneously with comptt yielded a better but still unacceptable fit ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "moreover , the data / model ratio shows the same structure in the fe  k@xmath8 line region that is seen in panel b of figure 2 .",
    "hereafter , we restrict our discussion to mcd plus power - law models .",
    "we note that comptt may still be a good description of spectra from cygnus x-1 in different states .    in table 1",
    ", we list the parameters obtained by fitting a series of mcd plus power - law models with different local models for the fe  k@xmath8 line region .",
    "model 1 includes a narrow gaussian to fit the narrow line evident in panel b of figure 2 ( see also figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "model 2 adds a smeared edge component ( `` smedge , '' ebisawa et al . 1994 ) .",
    "model 3 adds a gaussian to model 2 to fit a broad emission line .",
    "model 4 adds the `` diskline '' model ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 ) to model 2 instead of a gaussian .",
    "the diskline model explicitly takes into account the doppler and general relativistic shifts expected for a line produced via the irradiation of an accretion disk near to a black hole .",
    "these models yield apparently poor fits : @xmath35 1.8 .",
    "this is due to the fact that we have not fit a model for the complex absorption spectrum below 2  kev ( miller et al .",
    "2001a , 2001b ; schulz et al .",
    "2001 ; marshall et al .",
    "we include this energy range because it is critical for accurately characterizing the overall continuum shape .",
    "fitting the same models to the spectrum in the 1.810.0  kev band ( chosen to include the instrumental jump at 2.05  kev ) , statistically acceptable fits are obtained : @xmath360.851.15 .",
    "thus , we believe that the fits obtained on the 0.6510.0  kev band are meaningful .    the peak color temperatures of the inner accretion disk measured via the mcd model ( @xmath37 kev with model 3 ) are above those which have been measured in the low / hard state ( e.g. ebisawa et al .",
    "1996 ) , and below those measured in the high / soft state ( e.g. cui et al .",
    "the power - law indices we measure ( @xmath38 with model 3 ) are similarly intermediate . assuming a distance of 2.5  kpc to cygnus x-1",
    ", we measure @xmath39  ergs / s ( 0.5 - 10.0 kev ) with model 3 .",
    "this luminosity is approximately twice that commonly measured in low / hard state , but not as high as the luminosities observed during the high / soft states observed previously in 1980 and 1996 .",
    "indeed , belloni et al .",
    "( 1996 ) identify the activity in 1996 as an `` intermediate '' state based partially on a blackbody temperature of @xmath40  kev and a power - law index of @xmath41 ( the latter being intermediate between canonical low / hard and high / soft state values ) . as the spectrum and luminosity we have observed with _",
    "chandra _ are between typical low / hard and high / soft states values , we characterize this as an `` intermediate '' state .",
    "however we note that it is a different kind of intermediate state than described by belloni et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in that it is spectrally harder .",
    "if the distance towards a source and its inclination are known , the mcd model provides a measure of the innermost extent of the accretion disk . assuming a distance of 2.5  kpc and @xmath42 , and @xmath43",
    ", our fits indicate the inner disk may extend very close to the marginally stable circular orbit : @xmath44 ) via model 3 .",
    "as @xmath45 scales directly with the source distance in the mcd model , if the distance to cygnus x-1 is uncertain at the 25% level the inner disk extent should have approximately the same fractional uncertainty .",
    "errors in the inclination are less important , but non - negligible for intermediate values",
    ". therefore , we regard the inner disk extent measured via the mcd model to be consistent with the marginally stable circular orbit for a schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath46 ) for a small range of masses near 10  @xmath47 .",
    "shimura and takahara ( 1995 ) have proposed corrections to the mcd model to account for comptonization of the inner disk flux .",
    "they suggest that @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; @xmath50 is suggested as appropriate for galactic black holes .",
    "if such a correction is valid , the inner disk may be somewhat larger than the marginally stable orbit in the intermediate state .",
    "merloni , fabian , & ross ( 2000 ) have noted that the mcd model may systematically underestimate the inner disk extent and imply a changing inner disk radius at low @xmath12 , but yield acceptable measures at relatively high @xmath12 .",
    "as we have observed cygnus x-1 at a soft x - ray luminosity approximately twice as high as its persistent luminosity , the mcd model may give acceptable estimates of the inner disk extent . in principle , the fe  k@xmath8 line can serve as a check on the inner accretion disk extent .",
    "the fwhm of the broad fe  k@xmath8 line we discuss below is consistent with keplerian velocities expected if the inner accretion disk extends near to the marginally stable circular orbit , suggesting @xmath51 may be more appropriate in this state than @xmath50 .",
    "the complexity of the fe  k@xmath8 line region can be seen clearly via two methods . in figure 3 , the fit to the spectrum in the fe  k@xmath8 line region with model 3 is shown in detail . in figure 4 , we show the data / model ratio for a model which does not include components to fit the fe  k@xmath8 line region , following the procedure that iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1996 ) used to represent the fe  k@xmath8 line in mcg  63015 .",
    "relative to a model with no component to fit the narrow emission line , the narrow gaussian included in model 1 is significant at the @xmath53 level of confidence in the 0.6510.0  kev band and above @xmath54 in the 1.810.0  kev band .",
    "the line measured via model 1 is centered at @xmath55  kev ; this value is fixed in models 3 and 4 .",
    "if this line were due mostly to fe  i , this centroid energy would represent a blue - shift of @xmath56  km / s .",
    "the fwhm width of the line varies slightly depending on the underlying continuum model , but is easily resolved with the heg . via model 3 , we measure a fwhm of @xmath57  ev , or @xmath58  km / s ; a fwhm of @xmath59  ev , or @xmath60  km / s is obtained via model 1 .",
    "the equivalent width of the line also depends slightly on the underlying continuum : via model 1 we obtain w@xmath61  ev ; model 3 gives w@xmath2  ev .",
    "the apparent blue - shift of the narrow line from fe  i at 6.401  kev may be explained in terms of a line mostly comprised of fe  ii , and partially comprised of species below fe  ix ( kaastra & mewe 1993 ) .",
    "similarly , the measured fhwm of the line can be partially explained in these terms .",
    "alternatively , one may want to argue that the line is due mostly to fe  i , and that the blue - shift and fwhm velocities are physical .",
    "however , the blue - shift is less than the terminal velocity expected for a type - o stellar wind ( 1500  km / s ; castor , abbot , & klein 1975 ) ; it is reasonable to assume that a neutral part of the wind must be relatively far from the ionizing flux originating near the black hole , and therefore close to terminal velocity .",
    "moreover , the blue shift is far less than the jet velocity ( @xmath62 ) inferred from a spectral model by stirling et al .",
    "( 2001 ) in the low / hard state of cygnus x-1 .",
    "it is more likely that the shift and fwhm are partially explained by a line produced by a few moderately ionized species at a point more internal to the system .",

    "we conclude that approximately half of the strength of the line we observe must be produced via other means .",
    "we conclude that the irradiation of the cool outer accretion disk is likely to account for the extra line strength .",

    "we regard the broad gaussian plus smeared edge of model 3 , and diskline plus smeared edge in model 4 , as approximations to a self - consistent treatment of the doppler and gr effects expected near to a black hole , and to broadening effects expected if reflection is important . the smeared edge in models 2 , 3 , and 4 has a fixed width of 7.0  kev , as observed in other galactic black holes ( see , e.g. , sobczak et al .",

    "these facts give us additional confidence that the line we have observed is intrinsic to cygnus  x-1 , and not due to the instrumental response .",
    "the fwhm of the broad line implies doppler shifts which are a significant fraction of _ c _ and consistent with keplerian velocities near the marginally stable orbit around a schwarzschild black hole . as noted above , gravitational effects",
    "may also shape the line profile",
    ". however , other effects may be important .",
    "as fe  k@xmath8 line photons produced through disk reflection propagate through the disk and/or an ionized disk skin , they may undergo compton scattering . here",

    "these values give a broadening per scatter of 3% and 7% , respectively .",
    "for an fe  k@xmath8 line with a fwhm similar to that of the narrow line we observe , approximately 50 scattering events in a @xmath84  kev disk skin are required to reproduce the full width of the broad line we observe . for @xmath85 ( slightly above what we observe in cygnus  x-1 in this state ; see section 1 ) , rfy find that fe  xxv has a maximum ion fraction for @xmath86 , suggesting as many as @xmath87 scattering events . a hot coronal volume ( with @xmath88  kev , or higher ) is not expected to contribute to line broadening significantly as such volumes are likely to be optically thin . as the fwhm of the line we observe corresponds to @xmath89 , for a range of disk temperatures and",
    "ionized skin temperatures compton scattering is likely to be a relatively small but non - negligible broadening mechanism compared to doppler shifts and gravitational effects .",
    "a combination of an elevated source intensity , the resolution of the _ chandra _ hetgs , and a @xmath9030  ks exposure have allowed us to resolve the fe  k@xmath8 line region in the x - ray spectrum of cygnus x-1 for the first time .",
    "we clearly detect a narrow fe  k@xmath8 emission line , a broad fe  k@xmath8 emission line , and a smeared fe  k edge ( see figures 3 and 4 ) .",
    "these features can be explained in terms of an accretion disk illuminated by a source of hard x - rays , with the broad line and edge due to irradiation of the inner accretion disk , and the narrow line due to irradiation of the outer accretion disk .",

    "2002 ) , or in an _ xmm - newton _ observation of mcg  63015 by wilms et al .",
    "the broad line has a centroid energy of e@xmath91  kev , which differs significantly from fe  i at 6.40  kev .",
    "the line profile we have observed may be regarded as evidence for a line which is shifted and/or partially shaped by strong gravitational effects .",
    "previous observations of cygnus x-1 with the _ chandra _ hetgs have not clearly revealed similar structure in the fe  k@xmath8 line region .",
    "schulz et al . ( 2001 ) observed this source at a similar flux level for 15  ks ( half of the exposure time we report on ) , though with an observing mode less suited to this work and suffering heavily from ccd pile - up , forcing the use of higher - order spectra with lower sensitivity .",
    "cygnus x-1 was observed for 15  ks in the low / hard state , at a flux approximately half of the intensity we measured .",
    "preliminary results have been reported by marshall et al .",
    "( 2001b ) .",
    "the low / hard state observation does not reveal a narrow emission line , but may show evidence for a weak , broad emission line and smeared edge . if the outer accretion disk is relatively more flared in the intermediate state than the low / hard state , this could explain why a narrow line is only detected in our observation .",
    "the lack of clearly detected lines in other _ chandra _ observations of cygnus x-1 may indicate that the line is variable . however , it is possible that long exposures in the future with well - suited instrument modes will reveal structure in the fe  k@xmath8 line region across a range of source intensities .",

    "the relatively cool inner disk we have observed in the intermediate state of cygnus x-1 ( @xmath95  kev ) makes continuum flux from the disk less important in the fe  k@xmath8 line region than in transient systems .",
    "the low inclination ( @xmath96 ) of cygnus x-1 may also reveal irradiation of the inner disk more clearly than transient black holes with high inclinations .",
    "the fe  k@xmath8 line provides an important diagnostic of the innermost extent of the accretion disk .",
    "the breadth of the line and edge we have observed  if produced at the inner accretion disk  require a disk which extends close to the marginally stable circular orbit .",
    "the line profile is consistent with the values of the inner disk extent we have measured with the mcd model .",
    "this finding supports the ionized disk model of young et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for x - ray states in cygnus x-1 ( for another discussion of ionized transition layers , also see ycki , done , & smith 2001 ) . the inner disk extent in the intermediate state may be particularly incisive in evaluating the adaf model .",
    "esin et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found that the disk may extend to the marginally stable orbit in the high / soft state of cygnus x-1 , but may have recessed to @xmath97 in the low / hard state . that the inner disk extent is consistent with the marginally stable orbit in this intermediate state suggests the inner disk may not recede smoothly as a function of the mass accretion rate in cygnus x-1 . in commenting on the ionized disk and adaf models",
    ", it must be noted that within the larger set of states and behaviors observed in cygnus x-1 , this state may prove to be peculiar .",
    "several future observations of cygnus x-1 at high resolution are required to further evaluate these models .",
    "the main results of this paper may be summarized as follows :    @xmath98 we have resolved the fe  k@xmath8 line region into a narrow line consistent with the excitation of low ion species , and a very broad emission line and edge combination .",
    "the lines are likely produced via the irradiation of the accretion disk , with the broad line produced at the inner accretion disk and the narrow line excited at the outer accretion disk .",
    "this is consistent with models for x - ray reflection in galactic black holes and agns .",
    "the broad line shape may be determined predominantly by a combination of doppler shifts , the gravitational field of the black hole , and also by compton scattering in the accretion disk and/or an ionized disk skin as part of the reflection process .",
    "@xmath98 based on the accretion disk temperature , the photon power - law index , and the x - ray flux observed , we conclude that we observed cygnus x-1 in an intermediate state .    @xmath98 in this intermediate state , the mcd model suggests that the inner accretion disk extends close to the marginally stable orbit .",
    "this finding is supported by the broad fe  k@xmath8 line and edge profiles .",
    "thus , an inner adaf is not required to describe this state of cygnus x-1 .",
    "@xmath98 when well - suited observational modes and long exposures are used to observe bright galactic sources , the _ chandra _ hetgs is capable of resolving composite lines into components .",
