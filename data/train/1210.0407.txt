    "magnetic fields up to 32 t were provided by a resistive magnet and a capacitance - sensing metallic cantilever was used . to determine the absolute value of @xmath59 ( fig.2a ) , sensitivities of the each cantilever were calibrated in situ by detecting @xmath60 oscillation due to the sample mass at zero field .",

    "the angular dependence measurement of the @xmath24-value was carried out using the same single crystal at 4k , and the @xmath24-value for each angle has been precisely obtained from the correction using the mn@xmath61 field marker .          the torque detected by the cantilever method is a component perpendicular to the field - rotating plane ( fig.1b ) . for the @xmath66 rotation",

    "this is exactly what we observed ( fig.1:e and f ) .",
    "this indicates that the susceptibility can be diagonalized as in eq.([chidiag ] ) and that the anisotropy of the @xmath24-factor is the origin of the anisotropy of the susceptibility in this spin liquid system .",
    "having established that the magnetic susceptibility reflects the anisotropy of @xmath24-factor , we assume that the susceptibility is proportional to the square of the @xmath24-factor ( @xmath70 ) as in conventional paramagnetic systems",
    ". then @xmath14 can be obtained by the reduced susceptibility @xmath71 , which is determined from @xmath72 and @xmath73 as @xmath74 where the principal values of @xmath24-factor and @xmath75 are provided by the electron paramagnetic resonance measurements ( fig.1e and f ) as @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80degree .",
    "the susceptibility for the magnetic field perpendicular to the basal plane is , therefore , given by @xmath81 the two independent measurements @xmath72 and @xmath73 give quantitatively consistent results for @xmath25 ( red and green circles in fig.2a , respectively ) , confirming the validity of our analysis .",
    "the obtained @xmath82 in the spin - liquid state of etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 is nearly temperature - independent at low temperatures below @xmath83k .",
    "this immediately indicates that in the torque measurements , the curie contribution from the free spins of the impurities is almost exactly cancelled out .",
    "this indicates that such free spins are not subject to the @xmath24-factor anisotropy , which may be explained if the impurity spins reside at the etme@xmath0sb cation site between the dmit layers .",
    "the absence of the curie term is also confirmed from the field - linear magnetization without saturation in a wide field range covering large @xmath84 ratios , which can not be fitted by the brillouin function .    the paramagnetic temperature - independent susceptibility , in general ,",
    "may be originated from the orbital van vleck susceptibility and the spin pauli susceptibility .",
    "however , the van vleck term is found to be negligibly small in the closely related isostructural material et@xmath2me@xmath2sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 with slightly different cations et@xmath2me@xmath2sb . in this material",
    ", a large spin gap is formed below the first - order transition at @xmath85k , which has been attributed to the charge disproportionation in [ pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 anions .",
    "the susceptibility jumps from the value close to the present etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 case at high temperature to almost zero below the transition , indicating the absence of the van vleck paramagnetic susceptibility @xcite .",
    "this strongly suggests that the sizable paramagnetic temperature - independent susceptibility in the spin liquid state of etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 can be fully attributed to the spin pauli susceptibility .",
    "we also note that the diamagnetic landau susceptibility , if present , should give a very minor correction to the pauli susceptibility , because we did not observe the quantum oscillations at high magnetic fields .

    "the pauli susceptibility is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the fermi energy , @xmath89 is the density of states and @xmath90 is the bohr magneton . in 2d systems , @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the number of fermion ( spin ) per volume . using @xmath40 emu / mol ( fig.2a ) , the specific heat coefficient of the fermionic excitations , which corresponds to the sommerfeld constant in metals , yielded by the equation @xmath93 this value is of the same order of magnitude as the values reported by the heat capacity measurements  @xcite .",
    "provided that a substantial portion of the gapless excitations observed by specific heat is magnetic , the @xmath46 and @xmath25 values result in a wilson ratio close to unity , which is a basic properties of metals .",
    "the fermi temperature , given by the relation @xmath94 which is in the same order as @xmath95  k.      to find a quantum oscillation due to a spinon fermi surface , the magnetic torque of the pristine sample ( h@xmath18-dmit ( c ) ) was measured up to 32 t . the magnetization @xmath26 is estimated from the torque as described in section [ chi ] .",
    "after subtracting the background signal determined by a linear approximation to data above 12 t , the data is plotted as a function of @xmath96 as red line in the upper inset of fig.2b . however , no discernible oscillation is observed within the experimental resolution .",
    "an important requirement to observe the quantum oscillation in the torque ( de haas - van alphen effect ) in a metal is a long mean free path @xmath97 ( @xmath98 is the fermi velocity and @xmath99 is the scattering time ) to satisfy that @xmath100 exceeds unity , where @xmath101 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath102 is the effective mass and @xmath103 is the mobility . in a simple metal , the mobility can be estimated by using the residual thermal conductivity @xmath104 , the sommerfeld constant @xmath46 , and the fermi energy @xmath88 through @xmath105 by using @xmath106w / k@xmath42 m @xcite , @xmath107mj / k@xmath42mol @xcite , and @xmath108k estimated by the present susceptibility measurements , we can roughly estimate @xmath109t@xmath110 in the spin - liquid state of etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "this yields @xmath111 at 32 t , which strongly suggests that the impurity scattering effect is not the main origin of the absence of the quantum oscillations .",
    "a possible explanation for the absence of the quantum oscillations is that the coupling between the applied magnetic field and the gauge flux which causes the quantum oscillations is very small .",
    "this seems to be consistent with the fact that our torque curves can be described only by the @xmath24-factor anisotropy , without showing any contribution from the orbital ( spinon ) motion in the 2d plane .",

    "<S> here we show that a qsl state in the organic mott insulator etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 with two - dimensional triangular lattice  @xcite has pauli - paramagnetic - like low - energy excitations , which are a hallmark of itinerant fermions . </S>",
    "<S> our torque magnetometry down to low temperatures ( 30mk ) up to high fields ( 32 t ) reveal distinct residual paramagnetic susceptibility comparable to that in a half - filled two - dimensional metal . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates that the system is in a magnetically gapless ground state , a critical state with infinite magnetic correlation length . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , our results are robust against deuteration , pointing toward the emergence of an extended ` quantum critical phase ' , in which low - energy spin excitations behave as in paramagnetic metals with fermi surface , despite the frozen charge degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> *    at sufficiently low temperatures , condensed matter systems generally tend to order . </S>",
    "<S> qsls are a prominent exception , in which no local order parameter is formed while the entropy vanishes at zero temperature . in two- or three - dimensional ( 2d or 3d ) systems </S>",
    "<S> , it is widely believed @xcite that qsl ground states may emerge when interactions among the magnetic degrees of freedom are incompatible with the underlying crystal geometry . </S>",
    "<S> typical 2d examples of such geometrically frustrated systems can be found in triangular and kagome lattices . </S>",
    "<S> largely triggered by the proposal of the resonating - valence - bond theory on spin-1/2 degrees of freedom residing on a 2d triangular lattice @xcite and its possible application to high - transition - temperature superconductivity @xcite , realizing / detecting qsls has been a long - sought goal . until now </S>",
    "<S> , quite a number of qsls with various types of ground states have been proposed @xcite , but the lack of real materials had prevented us from understanding the nature of qsls .    the two recently discovered organic mott insulators , @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu@xmath2(cn)@xmath0 @xcite and etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 @xcite ( see fig.1a ) , are very likely to be the first promising candidates to host a qsl in real bulk materials @xcite . in these systems , ( bedt - ttf)@xmath4 cations or pd(dmit)@xmath5 anions </S>",

    "<S> rotation@xcite measurements exhibit no sign of long - range magnetic ordering down to a very low temperature whose energy scale corresponds to @xmath6 ( @xmath7k for both compounds ) , where @xmath8 is the nearest - neighbour exchange coupling energy . </S>",
    "<S> these findings aroused great interest because even in a quantum spin-1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet , the frustration brought on by the nearest - neighbour heisenberg interaction is known to be insufficient to destroy the long - range ordered ground state . </S>",
    "<S> several classes of qsl states have been put forth to explain these exotic spin states , yet their ground state remains puzzling . </S>",
    "<S> between the two compounds , etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 appears to be more ideal to single out genuine features of the qsl , because more homogeneous qsl state can be attained at low temperatures @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , @xmath3-(bedt - ttf)@xmath2cu@xmath2(cn)@xmath0 has been reported to have an inhomogeneous and phase - separated spin state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> what is remarkable in the qsl state of etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 is the presence of the gapless excitations , which are highly mobile with long mean free path , as reported by thermal conductivity @xcite and heat capacity measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are two fundamental questions that still remain open . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is the magnetic nature of the gapless excitations , which can not be obtained from the above measurements . whether the excitations are magnetic or nonmagnetic bears direct implications on the spin - spin correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> the second question concerns the phase diagram ; how the qsl varies when tuned by the non - thermal parameter , such as frustration , is the key to understanding the ground state . the uniform susceptibility in the low - temperature limit provides pivotal information on the magnetic character of the ground state </S>",
    "<S> . however , conventional measurements using squid magnetometer are susceptible to paramagnetic contributions due to impurities . indeed , for etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , the temperature region of importance is below @xmath95  k , but squid signal is dominated by the paramagnetic contributions residing on the non - magnetic cation etme@xmath0sb layers @xcite . to resolve the intrinsic magnetic susceptibility of the qsl in single crystalline samples </S>",
    "<S> , we performed the magnetic torque @xmath10 measurements by using micro - cantilever method @xcite ( fig.1b ) , which is the cross product of the applied field @xmath11 and the magnetization @xmath12 ( @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the spin susceptibility tensor diagonalised along the magnetic principal axes , see figs.1c and d ) as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the permeability of vacuum and @xmath17 is the sample volume . </S>",
    "<S> the most advantage of this method is that the large curie contribution from impurity spins is cancelled out ( supplementary information ) .        </S>",
    "<S> figures1e and f depict the magnetic torque curves of etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 ( h@xmath18-dmit ) when the magnetic field of @xmath19 t is rotated within the @xmath20 and @xmath21 plane , where @xmath22 is the polar angle measured from the @xmath23 axis . in these figures , we also plot the angular dependence of the gyromagnetic ratio ( @xmath24-factor ) arising from the spin-1/2 of [ pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 dimers . the uniform susceptibility </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 and magnetization @xmath26 perpendicular to the @xmath27 plane ( @xmath28 axis ) can be determined from the torque and @xmath24-factors ( supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> figures2a and b depict the temperature dependence of @xmath25 at @xmath19 t and the field dependence of @xmath26 at @xmath29mk , respectively , for pristine crystal ( h@xmath18-dmit ) and its deuterated compound ( d@xmath18-dmit ) , which has different degrees of geometrical frustration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value of @xmath25 is nearly 1.5 times larger than @xmath30 of polycrystalline samples of h@xmath18-dmit determined by the squid magnetometer ( fig.2a ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the most notable features are ( i ) @xmath25 is temperature independent below 2k and remains finite in zero temperature limit ( fig.2a ) and ( ii ) @xmath26 increases nearly linearly with the applied field up to 17 t ( fig.2b ) . in the dmit materials the orbital paramagnetic ( van vleck ) susceptibility is very small ( supplementary information ) , and thus the spin ( pauli ) paramagnetism should be responsible for the observed temperature - independent and field - linear paramagnetic response . </S>",
    "<S> these results in the low - temperature limit provide direct evidence of the presence of low - lying gapless ` magnetic ' excitations . </S>",
    "<S> it is also clear that the gapless excitations observed in the thermal conductivity  @xcite and the heat capacity  @xcite measurements contain the magnetic ones . </S>",
    "<S> as the spin gap @xmath31 is inversely proportional to the magnetic correlation length @xmath32 , this spin - gapless qsl state has infinite @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the presence of the gapless magnetic excitations is of crucially importance , as it immediately indicates that the qsl is in a critical state where the spin - spin correlation function decays with distance @xmath33 in an anomalous non - exponential manner : a simple example is the power - law decay @xmath34 with @xmath35 for the so - called algebraic spin liquid @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while nmr measurements report an anomaly at 1k @xcite , no anomaly is observed in the magnetic susceptibility , which is consistent with the thermal conductivity @xcite and specific heat measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the nmr anomaly at 1k is not a signature of the thermodynamic transition , but a phenomenon which may be related to the slow spin dynamics of the qsl .        </S>",
    "<S> there are two possible phase diagrams for the qsl as a function of frustration , as illustrated in figs.3a and b. with increasing frustration , a magnetically ordered phase with broken symmetry is destroyed at a critical value , beyond which a qsl phase without broken symmetry appears . </S>",
    "<S> the first case is that a gapless qsl with infinite @xmath32 emerges only at a quantum critical point ( qcp )  @xcite , beyond which the spin - gapped qsl with finite @xmath32 appears ( fig.3a ) . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the qsl is placed in a category of topological spin liquid in which spin correlation function decays exponentially with distance as @xmath36 except at qcp . </S>",
    "<S> the second case is that there is an extended critical ` phase ' , where the gapless qsl with infinite correlation length is stably present ( fig.3b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these two cases can be distinguished by comparing @xmath25 of h@xmath18-dmit and d@xmath18-dmit at @xmath37 , because deuteration of the me groups in etme@xmath0sb[pd(dmit)@xmath1@xmath2 changes the degrees of geometrical frustration by reducing @xmath38  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figs.2a and b , both h@xmath18- and d@xmath18-dmit crystals exhibit essentially the same paramagnetic behaviours with no spin gap , indicating that both materials are in a critical state down to @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> these results lead us to conclude the presence of an extended quantum critical phase of the spin - gapless qsl ( fig.3b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a stable qsl ` phase ' with gapless magnetic excitations is hard to explain in the conventional bosonic picture . </S>",
    "<S> within this picture , when the magnetic long - range order is established , the gapless nambu - goldstone bosons , i.e. magnons , would arise as the consequence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the spin su(2 ) symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> when the system evolves into the qsl state with no symmetry breaking , the common wisdom is that both of the magnetic order and nambu - goldstone bosons disappear at the same time . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the presence of gapless qsl phase has some exotic elementary excitations . among them , ` spinon ' excitation , which is a chargeless spin-1/2 quasiparticle ( half of the magnons ) , has been discussed extensively . in theories of the qsl with the bosonic spinons , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic order is described by the bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  @xcite of the bosonic spinons . </S>",
    "<S> when the magnetic order is destroyed or the bec disappears , the bosonic spinons in the resulting qsl can only be gapless at the critical point beyond which they become gapped  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of an extended region of spin - gapless qsl phase at zero or very low temperatures , therefore , would suggest that the underlying qsl phase may be better described by the qsl with fermionic spinons  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the gapless magnetic excitations bears some resemblance to the elementary excitations in the spin channel of metals with fermi surface , i.e. pauli paramagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> here we examine a thermodynamic test simply by analysing the data in accordance with the assumptions that the elementary quasiparticles in the qsl phase are 2d fermions with fermi surface , even though the system is an insulator ( see supplementary information for detail calculations ) . using @xmath40 emu / mol ( fig.2a ) , the specific heat coefficient of the fermionic excitations , which corresponds to the sommerfeld constant in metals , is estimated to be @xmath41mj / k@xmath42mol . </S>",
    "<S> this value is of the same order of magnitude reported by the heat capacity measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the fermi temperature , which is predicted to be the order of magnitude of @xmath43(@xmath44k )   @xcite , is estimated to be @xmath45k . </S>",
    "<S> thus , although the present simple estimations should be scrutinized , these thermodynamic quantities appear to be quantitatively consistent with the theory of the qsl that possesses a spinon fermi surface . in d@xmath18-dmit , while @xmath46-value is enhanced by nearly twice  @xcite , @xmath25 is reduced by nearly 15% , compared with h@xmath18-dmit . </S>",
    "<S> this may indicate that the nonmagnetic excitations , which enter not in @xmath25 but in @xmath46 , are enhanced close to the magnetic end point , whose origin deserves further studies .    </S>",
    "<S> the most direct evidence of the presence of the fermi surface may be given by the quantum oscillation measurements @xcite . to search such oscillations , </S>",
    "<S> we have measured the torque up to @xmath47 t at 30mk ( supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find an extended paramagnetic response up to the highest field , but no discernible oscillation is observed within the experimental resolution ( inset in fig.2b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a possible explanation for this is that the coupling between the applied magnetic field and the gauge flux which causes the quantum oscillations is very small .    </S>",
    "<S> the presently revealed extended pauli - paramagnetic quantum phase bears striking resemblance to metals with fermi surface rather than insulators even though the charge degrees of freedom are frozen . </S>",
    "<S> we also emphasise that the presence of such a novel quantum phase might provide profound implications on the physics of other class of strongly interacting many - body systems in the vicinity of the end point of long - range order as well as the exotic quantum spin systems .    </S>",
