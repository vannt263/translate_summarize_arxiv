    "the pixel scale was subsampled to 1245 , half the physical pixel size .",
    "an image of the uncertainty was derived from the square root of the image in instrument units with the same conversion factor applied , and a radial profile of the uncertainty was generated from this image in the same manner as from the image of the signal .",

    "we show the image of the disk with the signal from the star removed , from which we generated the profiles used for our analysis ( these are shown in figure [ fig : mips24profiles ] ) .",
    "the first and fourth panels are quite similar because the disk accounts for more than 95% of the total 24 @xmath1 flux from the system .",
    "in addition to radial profiles , we also measured the total flux density at 24 @xmath1 . before color correction , this was 7.45 jy using a circular aperture with a radius of 81@xmath25 ( the maximum flux in the encircled energy method ) .",
    "we applied a color correction of 1.056 ( for a blackbody with temperature of 100 k ) to only the disk flux ( 7.13 jy after subtracting the expected stellar photospheric contribution of 318 mjy ) , yielding 7.53 jy for the color - corrected disk flux and 7.85 jy for the color - corrected total flux .",
    "we assumed a 5% uncertainty on this measurement .",
    "although the total 24 @xmath1 flux exceeded the saturation limit ( @xmath26 jy for a point source at 3 s exposures ) , the data were not ( although close to ) saturated because of the extended structure .",

    "in this section we describe how we generated model debris disk images .",
    "the specific sets of models are discussed in subsequent sections . as mentioned previously , we focused our modeling effort on the parent body belt and halo components of the disk .",
    "we generated model images of these two components separately , and because the disk is optically thin , we could simply sum them together during the fitting process .",
    "each component was modeled as a wedge - shaped , determined by comparing vertical cuts of the wfc3 images with vertical cuts of model images made with a range of opening angles .",
    "we assumed the parent body and halo components had that same half - opening angle . ]",
    "disk extending between inner and outer radial boundaries @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the number density of grains in the disk varied as a power law with both stellocentric radius and grain size ( radius of @xmath36 ) as @xmath37 , and the grain size distribution was bounded by @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we used the code ` dustmap ` v.3.1.1 @xcite to generate model disk images in both thermal emission and scattered light .",
    "the disk geometry was input into ` dustmap ` by specifying the cartesian coordinates of the desired dust distribution .",
    "we setup our model space with the star at the origin , the @xmath40 coordinate to the right , the @xmath41 coordinate away from the viewer , and the @xmath42 coordinate up .",
    "our models were seen perfectly edge - on , i.e. @xmath43 with the midplane of the disk in the @xmath44 plane .",
    "we populated each model disk with grains equally spaced in cartesian space within the defined wedge - shaped disk .",
    "the desired pixel size of the model images was @xmath45 in order to be as small as the smallest pixels in our data images ( stis ) .",
    "the spacing of model particles in cartesian space was set to be the same as the pixel size ( 0.97 au ) , with the particles arranged to be located at the center of each pixel in the image plane .",
    "we set the field of view of the model image to be a square extending just to the outer edge of the disk .",
    "as the number of pixels spanning the field of view must be an integer , the final size of the model pixels differed very slightly from @xmath45 .",
    "each model particle was assigned an  intensity \" value , allowing the particle to represent this number of physical dust grains .",
    "we used intensity values to implement the radial variation in grain number density where @xmath46 . `",
    "dustmap ` can create a series of model images  each assuming the grains are all of a single size  and then sum the images together with relative  scaling \" values ; we used this feature to implement the grain size distribution . for both halo and parent body models ,",
    "the grain size distribution was sampled with 50 values distributed logarithmically between @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we scaled each model image to represent a disk with a mass of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "the dust composition entered the model via the optical constants of the material , which are the real and imaginary components of its index of refraction , given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 . from the optical constants , ` dustmap ` used mie theory to compute the absorption and scattering efficiency factors and the scattering phase function of the dust grains when generating model images .",
    "we did not calculate the thermal emission contribution to the models at 0.58 and 1.16 @xmath1 , nor did we include the scattered light contribution to the model images at 24 , 70 , and 870 @xmath1 ; the omitted components contribute negligibly to the total outputs at these wavelengths . ` dustmap ` model images were produced in jy / pixel , which we converted to mjy arcsec@xmath15 using the size of the model pixels .    in practice",
    ", we generated each model image in pieces to use computer resources more efficiently , taking advantage of symmetries afforded by assuming the disk was perfectly edge - on .",
    "we first modeled the region @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , and also split the @xmath40 range into two sub - models . combining these two sub - model images yielded one octant of the disk ( the  back \" side of one quadrant of the disk ) .",

    "finally , the quadrant model was mirrored over the @xmath40 and @xmath42 axes to yield a model image of the full disk .",
    "to compare the model images with the observations , we convolved our models with a model psf appropriate for each instrument .",
    "we used the ` tinytim ` software @xcite to generate model psfs for the two _ hst _ images . for the stis psf",
    ", we used @xmath11=0.58 @xmath1 , a model diameter of 10 , 0 defocus , and no oversampling . for the wfc3 psf we used the source spectrum of an a5 star , a model diameter of 10 , and 0 defocus .",
    "we selected the undistorted model , as the data products we used were corrected for the distortion in this instrument .",

    "the alma psf was modeled as an elliptical 2d gaussian function with fwhm major and minor axes of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .    before convolving with the model images ,",
    "the mips , pacs , and alma psfs were rotated to the same relative orientation with the disk midplane as in the observed data sets .",
    "we placed the model image onto the same pixel grid as the psf model by linear interpolation in log space using matlab s ` interp2 ` function , then we performed the convolution of the two images with matlab s ` conv2 ` function .",
    "finally , the convolved model image was interpolated onto the pixel scale of the observed image , and a radial profile was extracted using the same method as was used for the data ( described in ",
    "[ sec : data ] ) . because the models were axisymmetric and we fit to each side of the observed disk separately , we only used half of each model radial profile .",
    "the widths of the strips used to make the radial profiles were chosen to capture the majority of the flux along the midplane of the disk .",
    "the disk was unresolved in the vertical direction by mips and pacs , so the strip widths were set to @xmath12 the fwhm of these instruments psfs . to be symmetric , the strip widths needed to be an odd number of pixels : 5 pixels ( 6225 ) for mips and also 5 pixels ( 8) for pacs .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "images did resolve the vertical extent of the disk , and to guide our choice of strip width we examined the model images ( which had a vertical extent set to match the observed disk in scattered light ) .",
    "the images were brightest along the midplane and became much fainter above and below the midplane .",
    "for the halo images , the full width of the bright region was @xmath213 at @xmath57 = 10 .",
    "thus , we used strip widths of 25 pixels ( 127 ) for stis and 11 pixels ( 132 ) for wfc3 . as we will show , the alma data trace the parent body component .",
    "our parent body models had a bright midplane region with a full width of @xmath205 ( at @xmath57 = 4 ) .",
    "this is also approximately the resolution of these alma data , so we used a strip width of 5 pixels ( 05 ) .",
    "the first step in our characterization of the @xmath0 pic debris disk was to model its spatial properties , specifically @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath58 for both the halo and parent body components ( recall that @xmath37 ) . because we possessed well - resolved images of the disk",
    ", we could determine these parameters independently of the grain properties .",
    "once the spatial parameters were measured , we kept them fixed while modeling the grain properties , as described in the next section .    at sub - mm wavelengths , the small dust grains that likely constitute the halo component",
    "emit very inefficiently and the large grains in the parent body component dominate the signal .",
    "thus , we could constrain the spatial properties of the parent body component by modeling the alma image .",
    "we performed this fit with a grid search across the parameters of interest , and the results are shown in red in figure [ fig : spatialconstraints ] .",
    "we generated models with @xmath34 ranging from 35 to 70 au , @xmath35 from 130 to 170 au , and @xmath58 from 0 to 2.0 .",
    "for the spatial fitting , the grain properties were fixed at @xmath38 = 5 @xmath1 , @xmath39 = 5000 @xmath1 , @xmath59 = 3.65 , and a composition of astronomical silicates @xcite .",
    "we also varied the amplitude of the model over a large range of values .",
    "for each set of model parameters , we calculated the @xmath60 goodness of fit between the model and observed radial profile . for the ne side , the best fit model had @xmath34 = 45 au , @xmath35 = 150 au , and @xmath58 = 0.5 .",
    "the variable @xmath35 was fairly well constrained by these data , whereas @xmath34 and @xmath58 were not as well constrained . for the sw side",
    ", we thus tried using the same @xmath34 and @xmath58 as found for the ne side , but allowing @xmath35 to vary .",
    "this yielded a very good fit with @xmath35 = 155 au .",
    "we conclude that the parent body component does not show any prominent asymmetries in terms of these parameters .",
    "our values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 agree well with the analysis by @xcite who modeled these data with concentric dust annuli ( see their figure 3c ) .    with the spatial properties of the parent body component fixed , we next addressed the halo .",
    "because the grains in the halo are thought to be generated by collisions in the parent body belt , we used the same @xmath34 for both components . unlike the alma data , the wfc3 , mips , and pacs radial profiles showed no sharp truncation  the flux from the disk was simply lost in the noise at the outer edge .",
    "the pacs data showed signal to the largest radius , so we used these data to constrain @xmath35 .",
    "we found @xmath611800 au for both the ne and se sides , which was consistent with the detection of the disk to 1835 au by @xcite . to measure @xmath58 , we used the wfc3 data because the shape of the wfc3 profiles were not significantly influenced by the instrument psf . to ensure that we modeled only the halo component",
    ", we fit to the portion of the radial profile for @xmath62 ( @xmath63155 au ) .",
    "we fixed the grain properties to @xmath38 = 0.1 @xmath1 , @xmath39 = 5 @xmath1 , @xmath59 = 3.65 , and a composition of astronomical silicates .",
    "we found best fit @xmath58 values of 2.4 for the ne side and 3.1 for the sw ( see the blue curves in figure [ fig : spatialconstraints ] ) .",
    "as a check of our best fit halo @xmath58 values , we used the relation from @xcite for an edge - on disk that @xmath64 , where @xmath23 is the observed surface brightness power law exponent , @xmath65 is the disk surface density power law exponent , and @xmath66 describes the opening of the disk as @xmath67 . for our wedge - shaped models , @xmath68 .",
    "also , @xmath69 , so @xmath70 .",
    "thus , our measured @xmath23 values of -3.5 and -4.0 from  [ sec : hst / wfc3 ] predicted @xmath58 values of 2.5 and 3.0 for the ne and sw sides , which agreed with what we found from model fitting . according to @xcite , a collision - dominated halo has @xmath71 while a drag - dominated halo has @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath0 pic s ne side agreed with the collision - dominated case , whereas the sw side fell between the two cases .    in summary , we found the following spatial parameters . for the ne side of the disk @xmath34 = 45 au , the parent body @xmath35 = 150 au , the parent body @xmath58 = 0.5 , the halo @xmath35 = 1800 au , and the halo @xmath58 = 2.4 . for the sw side",
    "the spatial parameters were the same except that the parent body @xmath35 = 155 au and the halo @xmath58 = 3.1 .",
    "after successfully modeling the dust composition with a mixture of common materials (  [ sec : knownconstants ] ) , we fit the spatial parameters again , this time using the grain composition and size parameters of that best fit model .",
    "the results agreed with spatial parameters we found here when assuming the dust consisted purely of astronomical silicates .",
    "with the spatial parameters of the halo and parent body components determined , we next constrained the grain sizes and compositions by fitting models to our five images of the outer disk simultaneously .",
    "we performed our fitting only on the ne side , then checked if the same dust composition could also fit the sw side data (  [ sec : swcheck ] ) . in section [ sec:100astrosil ]",
    "we show that the data can not be reproduced with grains consisting entirely of astronomical silicates . in section [ sec : genericconstants ] we find that a relatively good fit to the data can be obtained with a simple parametrized model for the dust optical constants .",
    "then , in section [ sec : knownconstants ] we find a good fit to our data with grains consisting of a mixture of common materials and derive significant constraints on the allowed grain composition .",
    "we begin , however , in the next section with a description of our model - fitting procedure .      in principle , there were six parameters describing the grain sizes : @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath59 for both disk components ; however , before fitting we used physical arguments to narrow these to four free parameters .",
    "the largest particles in the parent body component were the planetesimals that resupply the dust through collisions .",
    "however , the total surface area in these large bodies was small , so their contribution to the observed signal was insignificant .",
    "thus , we set @xmath39 of the parent body component to 5000 @xmath1 , an arbitrary but sufficiently large value so the emission from grains larger than this does not contribute significantly to the total .",
    "the dust in the halo consisted of the smallest grains generated by the parent body collisional cascade  the grains small enough to have their orbits perturbed by the stellar radiation force . to model",
    "this , we defined the  transition \" grain size , @xmath73 , as a free parameter and set @xmath38 of the parent body component and @xmath39 of the halo component to this value . therefore , the halo and parent body components overlapped spatially ( they had the same @xmath34 ) but were segregated by grain size .",
    "in addition to the grain size parameters ( halo @xmath38 , @xmath73 , halo @xmath59 , and pb @xmath59 ) , the dust masses of each component , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , were also free parameters . because debris disks are optically thin at all wavelengths , the final radial profile model that we compared to the data was the linear combination of the parent body and halo model profiles .",
    "the amplitudes of the two model components were directly proportional to @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "although we fit to only one side of the disk , these masses refer to the total mass of the model disk components ( both sides ) .",
    "finally , there were the free parameters describing the dust composition , which were specific to the analyses described in the following sections .",
    "we performed our fitting with a grid search , populating a chi - squared matrix for each of the five images , with one dimension of the matrix for each free parameter .",
    "we then combined these matrices according to @xmath76 with @xmath77 representing each of the five images .",
    "we normalized the matrix from each image by the @xmath60 value of the best fitting model to that image in an attempt to weight the contribution from each of the five images equally . to find the constraints on a given free parameter , we stepped that parameter over its range of values , and at each point we searched the @xmath60 matrix for the minimum over every combination of the other parameters .    for the fitting",
    "described in the following sections , we fit the radial profile outwards of 3@xmath25 because in the wfc3 image the flux measured near the star was more likely to have been artificially reduced due to self - subtraction of the disk .",
    "this also minimized the influence of the @xmath34 spatial parameter on the fits , which was not well constrained .",
    "the outer edge of the fitting was specific to each band .",
    "many previous studies of debris disks  both analyses of images and seds  simply assumed the dust was composed entirely of astronomical silicates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    " astronomical silicates \" , however , is not well - defined material , rather it is a set of optical constants resembling silicates that has been optimized to reproduce the ism uv extinction curve . the latest version of these optical constants is given by @xcite .",
    "it was , nevertheless , useful to model the @xmath0 pic disk with these optical constants , as doing so allowed us to compare our results more directly with those from other studies .",
    "furthermore , there may be no clear superior alternative to astronomical silicates .",
    "debris disks almost certainly do have a significant silicate component to their composition , as shown by the detection of the distinctive emission feature at @xmath210 @xmath1 in the spitzer / irs spectra of many debris disks @xcite , including the inner warm component of the @xmath0 pic disk @xcite .",
    "however , a precise laboratory analog to the silicates in debris disk dust  and a set of associated optical constants spanning the uv to the mm  is not known .",
    "we performed the fitting while varying the grain size parameters over the following values : halo @xmath59 = [ 3 , 4 ] , halo @xmath38 = [ 0.1 , 0.5 ] @xmath1 , and @xmath73 = [ 2 , 5 ] @xmath1 .",
    "theoretical examinations of collisional cascades show that @xmath59 = 3.65 @xcite , so we adopted this for the parent body component .",
    "the best fit was obtained with @xmath38 = 0.1 @xmath1 , @xmath73 = 5 @xmath1 , and halo @xmath59 = 3 . however , as shown in figure [ fig : allastrosil ] , this model did not achieve a good fit to all of the images . specifically , the halo component ( which provided the link between the thermal and scattered data ) was fit well to the wfc3 data , but the model was too faint for the mips and pacs thermal emission data ( and also somewhat too bright at the shorter wavelength stis scattered light data ) .",
    "this was consistent with the mismatch between the scattered light and thermal emission found in attempts to model other debris disks with astronomical silicates  the model , when fit to the thermal data , was too bright compared to the scattered light observations .",
    "when modeling the dust composition , one is fundamentally manipulating the optical constants , and it is possible that there are degeneracies in this procedure  different mixes of grain compositions might produce similar optical constants and thus similar fits to broad - band data .",
    "we therefore start the discussion of optimizing the fit to @xmath0 pic by considering the optical constants themselves .",
    "we generated  generic \" optical constants with only a few free parameters roughly modeled after astronomical silicates .",
    "the imaginary component , @xmath50 , of astronomical silicates shows two broad maxima with a trough between , and goes to zero outside the maxima .",
    "we modeled this behavior with the piecewise step function @xmath78 we derived @xmath49 from @xmath50 using the kramers - kronig relation @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "when evaluating equation ( [ eq : kk ] ) numerically , we avoided the singularity by splitting the integral into two pieces , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , then summed the results .",
    "negative values of @xmath49 sometimes arose from this procedure at the wavelengths where @xmath50 was discontinuous ; we removed these negative values from the optical constants before passing them to the modeling code .",
    "we assumed both components had the same composition , as the grains in the halo are generated from collisions in the parent body belt .",
    "we again fit to the five radial profiles , using the grain size parameters of the best model from the previous section ( halo @xmath38 = 0.1 @xmath1 , @xmath73 = 5 @xmath1 , halo @xmath59 = 3 , and pb @xmath59 = 3.65 ) .",
    "we allowed @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 each to take the values [ 0.1 , 0.6 , 1.2 ] .",
    "we found that the best fit model had @xmath83 = 0.6 , @xmath84 = 0.1 , and @xmath85 = 0.1 .",
    "the best model is compared with the five data sets in figure [ fig : genericfitsne ] , showing that varying the optical constants can significantly improve the fits , even with a very simple prescription for their form .",
    "we now model the disk by mixing the optical constants of known materials . in principle",
    ", a broad variety of mixtures of materials might be able to approximate the desired optical constants , so we must use other constraints to guide the assumed grain composition .",
    "we kept the number of constituent materials to a minimum while still accounting for the primary types of materials expected .",
    "@xcite simulated the formation of planetesimals in the outer parts of protoplanetary disks of various c / o ratios , redox conditions , and temperatures . while the exact compositions of the resulting planetesimals depended on these disk parameters , the most common materials were always refractory silicates and metals , water ice , and simple carbon - bearing compounds that existed as ices or were trapped in the water ice as clathrates .",
    "these carbon - bearing ices and clathrates can be transformed into refractory complex organic material ( sometimes called ",
    "ice - tholins \" ) by exposure to uv radiation or cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "this processing makes the material darker ( lower albedo ) and redder .",
    "refractory organics are invoked to explain the low albedo and red color of some objects in the outer solar system @xcite .",
    "we therefore proceeded with four materials : astronomical silicates with optical constants from @xcite , water ice with optical constants from @xcite , refractory organic material with optical constants from @xcite , and vacuum ( to model grain porosity ) with @xmath86=1 and @xmath87=0 at all wavelengths .",
    "there are multiple sets of optical constants available for both water ice and organics ( e.g. see table 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "we selected these specific constants because they had been used previously by @xcite to model @xmath0 pic s mid - ir spectral features .",

    "+    although we only used two or three values for each of the grain size parameters , our best fit model agreed well with the data , so trying additional values of the grain size parameters was not justified considering our aim was to constrain the composition .",
    "furthermore , as shown by the thin colored curves in the top panels in figure [ fig : realcompparams ] , the general result for the grain composition  a mixture of astronomical silicates and organic refractory material with little to no ice  did not depend on the specific choice of grain size parameters .",
    "for an important check on our best fit model , we compared it to the full - disk thermal sed of the disk at @xmath104 @xmath1 where the flux from the outer components was dominant over the flux from the inner components .    to generate sed models , we first computed the dust temperature as a function of grain size and location from @xmath38 to @xmath39 and from @xmath34 to @xmath35 by equating the energy absorbed from stellar radiation ( given by the model in  [ sec : star ] ) with the emitted thermal energy .",

    "@xcite examined the sub - mm slope of the @xmath0 pic sed and concluded that the grain size distribution was shallower than predicted by a steady state collisional cascade .",
    "however , our best fit model has @xmath59 = 3.65 for the parent body component , as predicted for a collisional cascade .",
    "in addition to the sed , we present three more comparisons with other data sets in the appendix .",
    "these include the sw side of the disk ( our fitting was only to the ne side ) , t - recs disk profiles in the mid - ir , and measurements of the disk s scattered light color . in all three cases , our model agrees satisfactorily with the additional data set .",
    "to find the blowout size predicted for the best fit model we found in  [ sec : knownconstants ] , we calculated the ratio of the radiation force to the gravitational force on a grain , @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the grain density and @xmath110 is the radiation pressure efficiency for a grain of radius @xmath36 computed from the optical constants using the code ` miex ` @xcite .",
    "the blowout size occurs where @xmath0=0.5 , with smaller grains ( having larger @xmath0 ) being blown out . for the composition of our best fit model , the blowout size was 2.7 @xmath1 , which was between our best fit @xmath38 and @xmath73 values",
    "that is , our best fit halo model consisted of a mixture of sub - blowout grains in the process of leaving the system plus barely bound grains on elliptical orbits .",
    "one might expect that grains smaller than the blowout size would be depleted because they leave the system on short timescales . to test whether such a depletion was favored , we re - ran our fitting procedure ( using the same mixture of common materials as in  [ sec : knownconstants ] ) but with three dust components : a halo of sub - blowout grains , a halo of barely bound grains , and a parent body component .",

    "simulations by @xcite predicted that the dust surface area per decade of grain size would be reduced by three orders of magnitude in sub - blowout grains compared to barely bound grains .",
    "value above which the depletion occurred depended on the orbital location of the dust . at 30 au ( the location of the outer parent body belt in their model ) , the dust",
    "is unaffected by sublimation , and a depletion of three orders of magnitude in surface area per decade of grain size occurred at @xmath117 ( see their figure 5 ) .",
    "this orbital location is most applicable to our situation , so we adopted these results . ]",
    "we reran our three component fitting with this relative scaling between the sub - blowout and barely bound components imposed .",
    "we could not achieve a good fit to the data with any grain composition , confirming that sub - blowout grains were a necessary part of our model .",
    "additional evidence exists for sub - blowout grains in the @xmath0 pic system : detailed fits to the mid - ir spectral features used grains as small as 0.1 @xmath1 in size @xcite .",
    "the data of @xcite are particularly significant since they see spatially distributed spectral features from sub - blowout crystalline and amorphous silicates to 30 au , where it appears the features become lost in the noise .",
    "@xcite fit olivine features at 34 and 69 @xmath1 with a model emphasizing grain sizes of 13 @xmath1 and with the grain placement consistent with the inner part of the parent body disk , again showing the importance of sub - blowout grains in the overall sed .",
    "finally , the sed of @xmath0 pic ( figure [ fig : realcompsedne ] ) shows its 24 @xmath1 flux density to be within a factor of two of the peak , whereas it is more typical of debris disks to have a difference of an order of magnitude .",
    "that is , the warm spectrum arising from small grains is unusually prominent compared with typical disks .",
    "taken together with our models that showed no significant discontinuity could be tolerated in the grain size distribution at the blowout size , these observations support our assumption that small grains in the halo  many of them below the blowout size  are dominant in the output at wavelengths shorter than 50 @xmath1 .",
    "the emission at longer wavelengths is then contributed primarily by the larger grains in the parent body ring ( created in the collisional cascade therein ) , as required to fit the well - resolved image with alma .",
    "sub - blowout grains have been inferred from the modeling of other young , bright debris disks .",
    "for example , when modeling the debris disk around fomalhaut , @xcite found that a significant contribution to the observed flux came from sub - blowout grains . @xcite used @xmath38 = 0.1 to fit the thermal and scattered light of the hr 4796a disk .",
    "here we compare the composition / optical constants of our best fit model with those found in other studies .",
    "we reiterate that many models of debris disks simply assumed the dust was composed of astronomical silicates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other studies that did constrain the optical constants relied on fitting the thermal sed only and did not match the brightness of the disk in scattered light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite modeled the sed of @xmath0 pic with a focus on fitting the detailed shape of the @xmath210 @xmath1 feature , so their constraints were strongest for the inner dust component .",
    "they found that two grain populations were needed : silicate grains with organic refractory mantles and crystalline silicate grains .",
    "the silicate grains with organic refractory mantles were roughly consistent with the composition we found for the dust in the outer disk .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that the crystalline component detected near 10 @xmath1 was concentrated in the inner disk , while @xcite detected crystalline grains via their 34 and 69 @xmath1 features in the outer disk . in both cases ,",
    "the crystalline materials account for only a few percent of the dust mass , but are readily detectable in these small amounts because of their sharp spectral features .",
    "both because of their small concentration and because the broad spectral character of the crystalline material is similar to that of the amorphous material assumed in our model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , basing the model on the amorphous material is acceptable given our emphasis on providing as simple a fit as possible .",
    "@xcite derived expected dust compositions based on the solar elemental abundances , yielding four species with the following range of mass fractions : silicates ( 2447% ) , fes ( 714% ) , carbonaceous dust ( 0 - 20% ) , and water ice ( 3949% ) .",
    "the range is due to the unknown fraction of carbon that ended up in dust versus co gas .",
    "this mix of compositions was used to successfully fit the _ herschel _ thermal images of the fomalhaut disk @xcite , but was not quantitatively compared to the scattered light observations .",
    "dust particles in the uranus ring system are very dark in scattered light and lack water ice features @xcite , making them potential analogs for the dust in the @xmath0 pic disk .",
    "other solar system particles , like those in the rings of saturn , do not share these properties , however .",
    "the most direct comparison with our work is the characterization of the composition of the hr 4796a debris disk using both scattered light and thermal emission by @xcite .",
    "one of their best fitting models was an isolated case involving a large fraction of metallic iron .",
    "we did not include iron in our fitting of @xmath0 pic , but we consider it unlikely that the dust grains contain much metallic iron unless they have been exposed to very high temperatures .",
    "this fit illustrates our argument that multiple types of material are in principle capable of producing the optical constants needed to fit debris disk behavior . excluding this case",
    ", @xcite found that silicates and organics were generally preferred and water ice was not .",
    "this agrees with our findings for @xmath0 pic and suggests that there may be some commonality to the composition of different debris disks .",
    "matching the thermal emission and scattered light data simultaneously has been a persistent problem for debris disk modeling .",
    "here we investigated whether this problem could be solved by varying the optical constants ( and thus composition ) of the debris disk dust .",
    "we tested this on the @xmath0 pic disk , for which there are high - quality well - resolved images at many wavelengths , including in both scattered light and thermal emission .",
    "we fit our models to data from five instruments : _",
    "hst_/stis , _",
    "hst_/wfc3 , _ spitzer_/mips , _ herschel_/pacs , and alma .",
    "the main results of our modeling were as follows :    * when assuming the dust was composed entirely of astronomical silicates , we could not achieve a successful fit .",
    "this resulted in a model that was too bright in scattered light relative to its thermal emission  the same offset found by studies that attempted to model other debris disks using only astronomical silicates .",
    "* we found that a generic model for the optical constants with only a few free parameters could achieve a much - improved fit .",
    "this demonstrated that varying the optical constants was capable of solving the problem . *",
    "since a variety of materials might be capable of yielding the necessary optical constants , other constraints must be used to narrow the selection of grain compositions . *",
    "we modeled the dust as a combination of plausible materials  astronomical silicates , water ice , refractory organics , and vacuum .",
    "we found that a good fit could be achieved with a mix of silicates and organics , and that ice and vacuum were not favored .",
    "* this model also reproduced well the observed thermal sed , the scattered light colors , and the images from t - recs at two mid - ir bands . *",
    "the resulting best fit composition was similar to candidates for the composition of the hr 4796a debris disk found also by simultaneously fitting the thermal and scattered light observations @xcite .    with continued observations from",

    "our model color profiles show a constant color .",
    "however , using a wider profile cut to generate the profiles would result in an increasing red color over this range of the profile , because less of the bluer flux from above the wedge would be included with increasing distance from the star .",
