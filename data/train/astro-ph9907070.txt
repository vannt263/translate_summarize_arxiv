    "in the last few years , increasing evidence in favor of the fireball model ( rees &  1992 ) for gamma ",

    "beppo_sax ( boella et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the power law decay of the optical afterglow of several bursts has lasted for time ",
    "scales of a year , in striking agreement with the simplest fireball scenario ( wijers , rees &  1997 ) , in which a shock wave propagates in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , accelerating particles which then emit by the synchrotron process ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) .",
    "however a single shock wave can not account for both the temporal behavior of the @xmath1ray emission ( fenimore et al .",
    "1999a ) and for the requirement of a high efficiency in converting its kinetic energy into radiation ( sari & piran 1997 ) .",
    "in fact the time variability structure of bursts appears to be constant during the whole of the high energy emission ( fenimore et al .",
    "1999b ) , while the deceleration of a shock slowed down by interactions with the ism would produce a time dilation between the first and the last spike of the burst .",
    "moreover the observed variability can not be explained as the consequence of inhomogeneities in the ism since a radiative efficiency of less than @xmath2 would be expected ( sari & piran 1997 ; see however dermer , bttcher & chiang 1999 ) .    in the internal shock scenario , put forward by rees &  ( 1994 ) ,",
    "the inner engine produces many relativistic expanding shells ( or an unsteady wind ) with a distribution of lorentz factors centered on a mean value @xmath3 and width @xmath4 .",
    "the burst radiation is produced through the dissipation occurring when a faster shell catches up a slower one .",
    "no matter the physical mechanism producing the observed photons , the inner ( hidden ) engine is responsible for the temporal structure of the observed burst through the time history of the shell emission ( kobayashi , piran & sari 1997 ) . even if we may have information on the time ",
    "scale of the shell ejection , it is hard to estimate the bulk lorentz factor @xmath3 of the relativistic outflow .",
    "this is however a critical parameter to unveil the mechanism(s ) that powers the outflow and the radiating process that produces @xmath1ray photons .",
    "in fact , the knowledge of @xmath3 allows us to estimate the amount of baryon loading of the fireball and the intrinsic frequency of the emitted photons .",
    "the constraints related to the compactness problem ( see e.g. piran 1992 ) give a lower limit @xmath5 , while an upper limit @xmath6 is inferred from the need of having the fireball opaque till the acceleration stage is completed .",
    "this poorly constrains the properties of the outflow , leaving a broad interval for physically possible @xmath3 .    in this letter",
    "we analyze the kinematic evolution of an inhomogeneous fireball , in which the flow is approximated by discrete shells with different intrinsic properties ( baryon load , energy and lorentz factor ) and the outflow energy is dissipated through binary shell  shell collisions .",
    "we derive general constraints on the relativistic properties of the outflow both in the simplest internal shock scenario , that requires a single interaction for each couple of shells , and in the case of hierarchically developed internal shocks , in which successive shell mergers end up in a single ( or a few ) more massive shells , whose interaction with the ism produces the afterglow . the latter scenario is strongly favored by the need of dissipating a significant fraction of ordered outflow energy ( see also kobayashi et al .",
    "we describe the relativistic outflow as constituted of @xmath7 shells , each with its own relativistic lorentz factor @xmath8 , mass @xmath9 and energy @xmath10 .",
    "the global properties of the flow are described by the averages @xmath3 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 and their dispersions , by the total duration of the ejection of shells @xmath13 ( as measured in the rest frame of the inner engine ) and by the time interval between the ejection of two successive shells @xmath14 . if the ejection time of a typical shell equals the time of quiescent phase between the production of two consecutive shells , @xmath15 ( it is thus assumed that the time necessary to eject a fast or a slow shell is the same , see however panaitescu , spada and  1999 ) .",
    "the average mass , energy and relativistic factor are related as @xmath16 where @xmath17  erg is the total energy of the outflow . as @xmath18 and",
    "adopt cgs units . ]    the dynamics of each shell is characterized by an initial phase in which it is accelerated to its final lorentz factor as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the distance of the shell from the center of expansion at the ejection time ( see e.g. piran 1998 ) .",
    "this phase ends when the final lorentz factor is reached at the ` acceleration ' radius : @xmath21 during the following evolution , the shell coasts with constant velocity until an interaction with another shell or with the ambient medium takes place .",
    "assuming that the acceleration phase lasts for a time interval negligible with respect to the coasting phase , the interaction between two shells with lorentz factors @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) and initially spaced by a time interval @xmath14 occurs at a radius : @xmath25 where the numerical value has been computed for @xmath26 and assuming @xmath27 .",
    "the interaction of the shells with the ambient medium is a continuous process and does not happen at a well determined radius .",
    "however a typical scale can be estimated as the distance at which the shell lorentz factor is half its initial value , which is reached when the shell has swept up an external mass @xmath28 equal to its rest mass divided by the initial lorentz factor ( see  & rees 1997 ) . hence the deceleration radius can be approximated as @xmath29 , i.e. : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the density ( assumed uniform ) of the ambient medium and shells of equal energy have been considered . therefore , the more the shell is relativistic , the smaller the deceleration radius is ( eq .  [ eq : rd ] ) , while , on the contrary , the largest the radius at which internal shocks occur ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : ri ] ) .",
    "this allows us to put some constraints on the average relativistic factor of the flow , since observationally the internal shocks set up before the afterglow , i.e. before the development of the external shock .",
    "to fully describe the kinematic of the flow , a fourth transition radius is important , i.e. the radius at which the shell becomes transparent ( to thomson scattering ) .",
    "if , in fact , the shell becomes optically thin before the acceleration phase is completed , the internal energy can escape from the shell and the acceleration process is damped . on the other hand ,",
    "if two shells collide when still opaque , they give rise to a single shell that is reaccelerated to an intermediate lorentz factor .",
    "the transparency radius corresponds to : @xmath32",
    "fig .  [ fi1 ] shows a comparison of the four critical radii for a typical burst with energy @xmath33  erg and duration @xmath34 10 s. the ism has been assumed uniform with density @xmath35  @xmath36 .",
    "two cases have been considered : the left panel refers to a burst made by a ( relatively ) small number of shells ( @xmath37 ) , while for the right panel @xmath38 .",
    "the smaller value has been derived assuming that each of the burst pulses fitted by norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is produced by the interaction of a shell pair .",
    "norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find a number of pulses @xmath39 , and hence we have @xmath40 . in the latter case ,",
    "instead , the central engine emits shells at regular time intervals , equally spaced by the smallest variability time ",
    "scale observed in grb light ",
    "curves ( @xmath41s , schaefer & walker 1999 ) . in this situation",
    "each of the norris et al .",
    "( 1996 ) pulses is considered as a blend of sub  pulses , with an envelope corresponding to the varying efficiency of the central engine : indeed , walker , schaefer & fenimore ( 1999 ) have shown that millisecond variability on top of the larger time ",
    "scale modulation is a common feature of grb light",
    " curves .    in both cases",
    "the maximum value of @xmath3 is bound by the requirement that internal shocks must happen before external ones , while the minimum value is constrained by the transparency condition .",
    "this second constraint is less severe since , as already mentioned , collisions between opaque shells would simply cause a reacceleration of the merged shell .",
    "note however that this could play a role in preventing the presence of very slow shells outside the transparency radius @xmath42 .",
    "it should be also stressed that numerically the limit given by the transparency requirement is similar to the minimum value @xmath43 , already obtained from the compactness argument ( e.g. piran et al .",
    "the acceleration radius does not impose any significant constraint , showing that from the kinematic and radiative points of view , shells could be potentially accelerated even to very high lorentz factors @xmath44 .    from the condition @xmath45 we get an upper limit : @xmath46 this limit is quite robust with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath31 while it is more dependent of @xmath13 and @xmath48 .",
    "a variation of three orders of magnitude of the total energy changes it by a factor @xmath49 only .",
    "the density of the ism has been assumed uniform and @xmath50 one proton @xmath36 .",
    "this is probably a lower limit .",
    "however , even in the case of the hypernova scenario ( paczynski 1998 ) , in which grb would occur in a much denser environment ( @xmath51  @xmath36 ) , @xmath52 decreases only by a factor of @xmath49 .",
    "finally , the total burst duration of 10 seconds corresponds to the mean t90 parameter of the long grbs , and is appropriate for the majority of bursts .",
    "its small uncertainty influences @xmath52 rather weakly .",
    "the efficiency of internal shocks in converting the bulk outflow energy into internal energy can be easily estimated since each collision satisfies energy and momentum conservation ( see also kobayashi et al .",
    "consider two shells of rest masses @xmath53 and @xmath54 and lorenz factors @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath55 ) , respectively .",
    "calling @xmath56 the internal ( random ) energy of the merged shell after the interaction , we have : @xmath57 where the subscript @xmath58 refers to quantities after the interaction and @xmath59 .",
    "if we assume that all of the internal energy is converted into radiation , we obtain - independently of the emission mechanism - an upper limit for the efficiency @xmath60 . from the conservation equations an implicit solution for the final bulk lorentz factor of the merged shells and the maximum radiative efficiency can then be derived : @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "the above relations give an _ upper limit _ to the fraction of energy that can be radiated in photons .",
    "in fact , strictly speaking , @xmath63 is the fraction of bulk kinetic energy converted into internal energy . in the standard synchrotron shock model , this random energy",
    "is equally shared among protons , electrons and magnetic field , and only one third of this energy ( the fraction going to electrons ) can be radiated ( see e.g. panaitescu et al .",
    "the major features of eq .",
    "[ sist ] are that for a large difference in the lorentz factors ( @xmath64 ) the efficiency can approach unity and that for a fixed value of @xmath65 the maximum efficiency is reached when @xmath66 . for @xmath67 , as for internal shocks , the expression for @xmath63 reduces to : @xmath68 an even simpler relation is found if the two shells have the same total energy ( i.e. @xmath69 ) : @xmath70 in this latter case the efficiency is always lower than 30% , independently of @xmath65 .",
    "[ fi4 ] shows the efficiency for low  intermediate values of @xmath65 in two limits : the most efficient situation ( @xmath66 , dashed line ) and the equal energy case ( @xmath71 , solid line ) .",
    "the limit @xmath72 has been assumed . note",
    "that , in this case , the efficiency does not depend on the value of @xmath22 .",
    "let us now consider the global efficiency of the burst . in the ` standard ' internal shock scenario ( rees &  1994 ) the shells have a distribution of lorentz factors with mean value @xmath3 and width @xmath4 .",
    "this in turn corresponds to a distribution of @xmath65 with @xmath73 within a factor of order unity ( which accounts for the particular shape of the distribution ) .",
    "this implies ( see fig .",
    "[ fi4 ] ) @xmath74 , independently of the mass ratio @xmath75 .",
    "a numerical simulation for a log  normal distribution of @xmath0 with @xmath76 , gives @xmath77 .",
    "these ( upper limits on ) efficiencies are problematic since , in the absence of extreme beaming , the total energy release of the most powerful grbs would exceed by some orders of magnitude the maximum energy release achievable by current models , that involve a stellar mass black hole as the energy source . if , e.g. , grb  990123 had an efficiency of @xmath78 , the required energy would be @xmath79  erg . an extremely narrow beaming angle @xmath80 would be then needed to reduce the energy release to the value @xmath81  erg .",
    "a higher efficiency can be only obtained by allowing for a broader distribution of relativistic factors @xmath0 and imposing that all shells have roughly the same mass , somehow requiring a finely tuned variable engine . moreover",
    ", a very broad distribution of lorentz factors implies that the compton drag effect becomes crucial , as described in the following section .",
    "let us assume that the emission produced in the interaction between two shells is isotropic in the shell comoving frame @xmath82 .",
    "consider also a third shell , faster than the previous two , with lorentz factor @xmath83 in that frame .",
    "this moves in the radiation bath of total energy @xmath84 produced in the interaction , and thus compton scatters a fraction @xmath85 of the photons , increasing their energy by a factor @xmath86 ( here @xmath85 is the thomson optical depth of the fast shell ) .",
    "the total energy lost by the fast shell in the frame @xmath82 is hence @xmath87 .",
    "if @xmath88 approaches unity , there are two major consequences : first a significant part of the energy of photons is due to the inverse compton mechanism rather than to the internal shock dissipation process ; second , the fast shell looses a significant fraction of its bulk kinetic energy to up ",
    "scatter the primary photons and this causes a braking of the fast shell ( in the frame @xmath82 ) .",
    "thus , even if the original distribution of @xmath0 factors were very broad , the early interactions would give rise to an efficient inverse compton drag on the faster shells , reducing the mean value of @xmath65 in the successive collisions and hence the global efficiency of internal shocks .",
    "moreover , in this case the net energy produced through inverse compton scattering would be equal or even larger than that directly due to shocks , and the primary emission mechanism would be different .",
    "we plan to investigate this issue in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the low efficiency predicted by eq .  [ aneff ] refers to a single interaction between two shells",
    ". however , each time this interaction takes place , a new shell is formed which can in turn catch up ( or be caught by ) another one . if the @xmath89 interaction has efficiency @xmath90 , after @xmath91 of them the fraction of the initial bulk energy converted into photons will be : @xmath92 if the efficiency is constant ( @xmath93 ) and @xmath91 is arbitrarily large , all the energy of the outflow can be converted into radiation , as @xmath94 for any value of @xmath63 . for the typical efficiency @xmath77",
    "derived above , about 9 interactions are needed to obtain an overall @xmath95 efficiency .",
    "assuming that , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ treeps ] , the collision ` tree ' develops as a binary bifurcation , the number @xmath96 of shells that has to merge into a single one after @xmath509 interactions is @xmath97 .",
    "this result has two main consequences .",
    "firstly , it is unlikely that a burst with high efficiency is produced by a small ( @xmath98 100 ) number of shells : a scenario in which the inner engine emits a large number of shells is thus favored .",
    "secondly , in deriving @xmath52 ( eq .  [ gamlim ] ) we assumed that a single interaction was enough to power a grb .",
    "however , within the hierarchical scenario , a shell must interact with @xmath99 other shells and hence eq .",
    "[ gamlim ] must be modified as : @xmath100 which gives @xmath101 for - say - @xmath38 and @xmath102 .",
    "even if this is an illustrative value only ( the actual number depending on the details of the initial distribution of the lorentz factors ) , we conclude that values of @xmath3 larger than @xmath103 are unlikely .",
    "we have analyzed the kinematic efficiency of internal shocks in a fireball made of many individual shells .",
    "since the radius at which the internal shocks set up grows with the average lorentz factor of the flow , while the development of an external shock is favored by a higher relativistic motion , we can put limits on the average lorentz factor @xmath3 of the flow if - as inferred from observations - internal shocks develop _ before _ the external one .",
    "moreover ( see also kobayashi et al .",
    "1997 ) we conclude that a simple internal shock scenario in which each shell is caught up by a single faster shell , suffers from a very low radiative efficiency , unless extremely different lorentz factors are involved .",
    "these would however cause a dramatic compton drag effect , which in turn constrains the possibility of a very broad @xmath0 distribution .",
    "a possible solution is to have a flow with moderately relativistic lorentz factors @xmath104 in which collisions develop until a single ( or a few ) massive shell is formed . for this to happen the shells have to be ejected at small time intervals , of the order of milliseconds . in this case",
    "each burst is made of more than a thousand spikes that merge to produce the broad peaks often observed in grb lightcurves .",
    "these peaks would then reflect a modulation of the hidden central engine that powers the burst , rather than a single collision .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether an outflow with significantly higher lorentz factors produces a burst or not . in a flow with very high @xmath3 ,",
    "the internal shocks set - up at a larger radius , and hence a hierarchical internal shock can not develop . since the efficiency is roughly proportional to the number of shocks a shell undergoes , a higher bulk gamma is linked to a lower efficiency .",
    "observationally , this implies that the ratio between burst and afterglow fluences is a function of @xmath3 , being larger for smaller @xmath3 .",
    "a further consequence is that very short ( millisecond ) bursts should be characterized by smaller efficiencies and brighter afterglows . to date",
    ", this can be only a prediction since the _",
    "beppo_sax trigger works only for long burst .    as a final note , following the explosion of the bright burst grb  990123 , two values of @xmath3 have been derived .",
    "sari & piran ( 1999 ) obtain @xmath105 from the optical flash intensity while liang et al .",
    "( 1999 ) estimate @xmath106 from the lightcurve properties . despite the differences , both values are in agreement with the general limits derived in this letter",
