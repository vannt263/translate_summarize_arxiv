    "recent advances in particle synthesization and the permanent need for novel materials meeting more and more specialized requirements encourage the search for novel types of functionalized particles .",
    "promising candidates in this area are colloids with directional interactions .",
    "these interactions are the key for the controlled self - assembly of colloidal particles into specific structures .",
    "recent research on this topic resulted in complex colloidal particles characterised by complex shape  @xcite , anisotropic internal symmetry  @xcite or surface charges  @xcite .",
    "understanding the interaction - induced behaviour of such particles is crucial for optimizing their application e.g. in material science biomedicine or sensors .",
    "+ yet , not only the application of functionalized particles is of interest but also their capability to serve as model systems to study fundamental concepts of physics such as self - organization  @xcite , chirality  @xcite , synchronisation  @xcite , critical phenomena  @xcite , entropic effects  @xcite and active motion  @xcite , to name a few .",
    "a paradigm example is the model of dipolar hard and soft spheres which is a well - established model to examine and understand the properties of magnetic colloidal particles immersed in a solvent , also called ferrofluids . from numerous studies of the phase behavior of dipolar liquids ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and especially of their structural properties ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    ", it is known that the dipoles assemble into chains , rings and branched structures at sufficiently large dipolar strengths and low densities .",
    "+ here , we focus on ( permanent ) ferromagnetic colloids with anisotropic symmetry , i.e. the magnetic moment within the colloidal particle is not located at the geometric centre of the particle .",
    "a first theoretical description for decentrally located dipoles was introduced by holm _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in their model ,",
    "spherical particles carry a dipole moment which is shifted out of the particle centre and is oriented parallel to the raduis vector of the particle .",
    "the model describes very well the cluster formation of particles carrying a magnetic cap  @xcite .",
    "yet , it is insufficient to mimic the self - assembly of so - called patchy colloids  @xcite , that is , silicon balls carrying magnetic cubes beneath their surfaces . furthermore , the model does not reproduce the zig - zag chained structures formed by magnetic janus particles in an external field , i.e. particles where one hemisphere of silica spheres are covered with a magnetic coat  @xcite .",
    "the concept of shifting the dipole was later extended by fixing the amount of shift and varying the orientation of the dipole moment vector within the particle  @xcite which was proven to be more convenient for patchy collids .",
    "+ in the present contribution we consider a model in which the dipole moment is laterally shifted such that the radius vector and the dipole moment vector are oriented perpendicular .",
    "the same model was also proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite.however , here we fix the orientation of the dipole moment and vary the amount of shift .",
    "thereby , we do not only aim at modeling synthesized particles mentioned above .",
    "rather , we are interested in understanding the impact of successively shifting the dipole on the self - assembly of such particles . to this end , we perform ground state calculations for a small number of dipolar hard spheres and conduct molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations to study the bulk at finite temperature in three dimensions . very recently ,",
    "novak _ et al .",
    "_ have considered the same model  @xcite , however , they restricted their study to systems where the particles are fixed in a plane with freely rotating dipoles .",
    "thus , they considered a quasi - twodimensional ( q2d ) system .",
    "besides , the authors examined the system at one fixed density . here , we examine a three dimensional system of such particles at zero temperature and conduct md simulations of the bulk at several thermodynamic state points .",
    "thereby , we aim at a quantitive characterization in which the shift is the stateparameter in the system .",

    ", there are two qualitatively different types of dipolar orientations .",
    "the first type is likewise triangular with all the pair angles ( i.e. the angles between the three dipolar pairs ) attaining the value of @xmath118 for shifts up to @xmath119 , as confirmed by the plot in fig .",
    "[ three_particles](e ) .",

    "thus we conclude that the described self - assembly of the particles at different shifts is a quite general behaviour which results from the increasing dipolar coupling strength for increasing shifts .",

    "[ figsdists](b ) and ( e ) , although there is a preferential emergence of small assemblies , large aggregates of up to @xmath180 particles are present in a non - negligible number and secondary peaks at e.g. @xmath181 ( for @xmath141 ) and @xmath182 ( for @xmath142 ) are visible",
    ". evidently , for this and comparable shifts , small and large assemblies can coexist .",

    "[ figs_size_mag](a ) and ( c ) @xmath187 as a function of the shift .",

    "the maximum is reached at @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "this increase can be understood by the effective increase of the dipolar coupling strength @xmath130 ( see preceding discussion ) such that initial shifts result in the formation of longer chains of type ( a ) .",
    "if @xmath0 exceeds this value , @xmath191 starts to gradually decrease because with increasing shift , smaller aggregates are formed more frequently ( see fig .",
    "[ figsdists ] ) . finally , @xmath191 attains the value of about @xmath192 particles in the high shift end , which is a highly representative value for both temperatures considered [ figs .",
    "[ figsdists](c ) and ( f ) ] .",
    "significant differences between the results of the two temperatures can be seen only for shifts smaller than @xmath185 where mainly chainlike aggregates are formed .",
    "here , the increase of temperature , which involves the decrease of the coupling strength from @xmath193 to @xmath194 , causes the formation of chains with less particles . moreover , for these values of @xmath0 , shifting the dipoles does not impose fundamentally different self - assembly patterns compared to nonshifted dipoles .",
    "therefore , small shifts can be regarded as perturbation of the nonshifted system .",
    "+ on the other hand , high shifts impose significantly different structures : the particles exclusively form structures of type ( d ) that correspond to ground state configurations of two , three and four hard spheres [ see figs .  [ two_particles](d ) ,  [ three_particles](c ) and  [ four_particles](c ) ] .",
    "this is possible due to the large values of @xmath195 for @xmath196 or @xmath197 for @xmath142 .",
    "+ finally , for intermediate shifts , where large aggregates as well as small clusters are formed , the decrease of @xmath191 ( and at the same time of @xmath183 ) can be interpreted as a transition region in which large aggregates gradually dissolve into small clusters until no large structures appear at all . within this region , the competition between energy minimization and entropy maximization results in the coexistence of both , small and large aggregates .",
    "with increasing shift ( i.e. , effectively increasing @xmath134 ) , the particles accomplish to form structures equivalent to ground state configurations .",
    "+ to summarize , in the bulk systems at the finite temperatures and densities considered here , we can qualitatively distinguish between three shift regions ( small , intermediate and high ) each of which is characerized by it s own structural characteristics .",
