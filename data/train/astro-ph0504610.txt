    "the observation of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhe cr ) of energy @xmath1ev@xcite has stimulated much theoretical and experimental activity in the field of astroparticle physics .",
    "these cosmic rays are are expected to be suppressed by interactions with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , what is known as the greisen zatsepin kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff@xcite . although many mysteries remain to be solved @xcite , we know it is virtually impossible to produce these energetic particles without associated fluxes of gamma rays and neutrinos from pion decays . the gamma rays pair produce in the background photon fields and the electrons loose energy through synchrotron emission in a `` cosmic cascading '' process which degrades their energy down to the 100-mev region .",
    "neutrinos travel undisturbed carrying a `` footprint '' of the production model .",
    "it is remarkable that the diffuse gamma rays in the 100-mev region , uhe neutrinos and uhe cr are deeply related .",
    "their precise measurements , crucial for unraveling the mysterious origin of the highest energy particles in the universe , must be considered part of the same priority .",
    "high energy cosmic ray production mechanisms are basically of two types , namely acceleration models and `` top - down '' scenarios @xcite .",
    "neutrino fluxes in the eev range are difficult to avoid but their fluxes are uncertain @xcite . in models that accelerate protons and nuclei ,",
    "pions are believed to be produced by cosmic ray interactions with matter or radiation at the source . in `` top - down '' scenarios protons and neutrons",
    "are produced from quark and gluon fragmentation , a mechanism which is known to produce about 30 times more pions than nucleons .",
    "furthermore protons and nuclei also produce pions in their unavoidable interactions responsible for the gzk cutoff which decay to produce the _ cosmological neutrinos _",
    "cosmological neutrinos could dominate in some acceleration models but in top - down scenarios they should be well below the neutrinos from the decays of the fragmented pions .",
    "the uhe proton to neutrino flux ratio is thought to carry important information concerning the origin of uhe cr .",
    "high energy neutrinos produce extensive air showers and can be detected by the very same detectors that measure the cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "the main challenge lies in separating showers initiated by neutrinos by those induced by regular cosmic rays .",
    "it was already suggested in the 1960 s that this could be done at high zenith angles  @xcite because the atmosphere slant depth is quite large .",
    "neutrinos , having very small cross sections , can interact at any point along their trajectories while most of the air showers induced by protons , nuclei or photons are absorbed before reaching ground level .",
    "the signature for neutrino events is thus inclined showers that interact deep in the atmosphere .",
    "inclined showers were first observed in the 60 s by several groups @xcite .",
    "the observed rate for shower sizes between 10@xmath2 - 10@xmath3 particles detected in the tokyo ( ins ) array @xcite is however consistent with hard processes induced by energetic muons that interact deep into the atmosphere @xcite . for shower sizes above 10@xmath3 particles",
    ", akeno has published an upper bound on muon poor air showers at zenith angles greater than 60@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "these observations have been very useful for establishing bounds on models for high energy diffuse neutrino fluxes at the earth @xcite .",
    "inclined showers were also detected in haverah park ( hp ) , a @xmath5km@xmath6 air shower array in the uk .",
    "the largest events detected by haverah park were actually coming at very large zenith angles @xcite .",
    "the inclined data set was recently studied and shown to be consistent with hadronic origin @xcite . when the auger project was conceived as the largest and most accurate air shower detector @xcite",
    ", it became clear that it would have a competitive acceptance for inclined showers induced by neutrinos compared to devoted neutrino experiments in planning or construction @xcite .",
    "other experiments have been proposed to search for deep inclined showers in the atmosphere from satellites at orbital altitudes that allow large volumes of atmosphere to be monitored to increase the chances of detecting neutrinos@xcite or from behind mountains  @xcite .",
    "although neutrinos of @xmath0 flavor are heavily suppressed at production , neutrino flavor oscillations @xcite , a maximal @xmath7 mixing and a 2:1 ratio of @xmath8 at production , lead to approximately equal fluxes of all three flavors after propagation over cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "when the @xmath9 undergoes a charged current interaction it produces a @xmath0 which , having a short lifetime , typically decays in flight .",
    "the process can induce two showers separated by a distance gap that is on average proportional to the @xmath0 energy .",
    "these events were soon discussed in the context of deep underground neutrino telescopes and referred to as `` double bang events '' @xcite . more recently",
    "double bang events have been explored for higher energy neutrinos in the atmosphere @xcite . as a @xmath9 propagates through the earth , charged current interactions followed by @xmath0 decays ( which always include a lower energy @xmath9 ) effectively shift the neutrino energy `` regenerating '' the @xmath9 flux @xcite .",
    "for the higher energy neutrinos these processes can occur several times . for neutrinos traversing most of the earth",
    "the emerging flux has a characteristic `` pile - up '' at an energy region around the pev scale , except for those entering with high zenith angles .",
    "it was remarked in 1999  @xcite that the perspectives of detecting @xmath9 fluxes can increase dramatically for neutrinos that enter the earth surface just below the horizon traversing a relatively small earth matter depth .",
    "these neutrinos can undergo a charged current interaction to produce a @xmath0 that actually exits the earth and decays in the atmosphere producing an upcoming air shower .",
    "these  earth skimming ",
    "neutrinos can be very effective in producing @xmath0 s because of the long @xmath0 range at high energies ( @xmath10  km ) which sets the scale of the effective volume .",
    "this has turned into a promising field that has been studied by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "monte carlo calculations have been performed for the surface array of the auger detector @xcite , for mountain ranges @xcite and in general for atmospheric @xmath0 production rates in general @xcite , and there are analytical calculations for the fluorescence part of the auger experiment@xcite and for hires and the telescope array @xcite . in this article",
    "we calculate both down - going and upcoming rates of neutrino induced air showers relevant for arrays of particle detectors using analytical methods .",
    "comparative studies made by simulation have also been discussed by in the context of shower detection from satellites  @xcite .",
    "although the detailed rates in an air shower array are expected to be very dependent on detector technicalities we examine the energy spectra of the induced showers to compare the down - going neutrino event rate to the upcoming rate induced by earth skimming neutrinos .",
    "above 1  pev the earth becomes opaque to neutrinos and only down - going or earth skimming eev neutrinos can be detected .",
    "the challenge lies in the identification of these showers in the background of down - going cosmic rays and atmospheric muons .",
    "inclined showers in the atmosphere are expected to play a crucial role for the detection of eev neutrinos .",
    "the main background for the detection of inclined showers produced by neutrinos is due to showers induced by protons and nuclei .",
    "these are expected to develop high in the atmosphere so that when the shower front reaches ground level it has very different properties from `` ordinary '' vertical showers that are observed in the vertical direction .",
    "deep inclined showers induced by neutrinos can develop close to ground level so that their shower front resemble that of a typical vertical proton cosmic ray shower .",
    "there is a second type of background to inclined showers induced by neutrinos which is due to deep showers induced otherwise , mostly through hard muon bremsstrahlung . unlike those produced cosmic rays these can not be distinguished from down - going neutrino induced showers on the basis of the muon interaction point because they can also be deep .",
    "it is difficult to believe this background could be separately identified , alternatively it is thought that it sets the detectability limits for neutrino interactions .",
    "the success in the search for inclined showers induced by neutrinos depends crucially on obtaining reliable information on shower properties related to the depth of the first interaction .",
    "fluorescence detectors actually register the depth development of the air shower and the depth of shower maximum , which is closely related to it , can be directly obtained . for these detectors upcoming showers , such as typical neutrino earth skimming events ,",
    "can be in principle easily identified . in these respects",
    "the fluorescence technique is most reliable and only good reconstruction accuracy is required for neutrino identification .",
    "unfortunately background light introduces a duty cycle which limits its acceptance both for cosmic ray and neutrino detection .",
    "air shower arrays measure the particle densities as the shower front reaches ground level and thus the inference of the depth of the first interaction is a far more indirect measurement . for close to horizontal events",
    "it is actually not possible to distinguish upcoming from down - going events from the arrival times of the signals , so that other shower characteristics must be used to identify potential neutrino induced events .",
    "the study of the difference between deep and shallow inclined showers has been the subject of much activity in the recent past .",
    "it is now believed that there are a number of properties of the shower front that can be easily used to distinguish neutrino induced showers , mostly stemming from the time distribution of the shower particles .",
    "we discuss briefly the basis of these differences .",
    "however the detailed calculation of the efficiency of a given detector to separate deep showers from those induced by protons and nuclei is quite a technical issue which lies beyond the scope of this article .",
    "the neutrino cross sections have a direct impact on the expected shower rates .",
    "unfortunately the cross section has to be calculated using quite significant extrapolations of data obtained in accelerators and there is uncertainty involved . at the end of this section we briefly review the basics of the standard model neutrino interactions and give the details of the cross sections used for completeness .",
    "the effects of non - standard model behaviors of the cross section can be quite dramatic in the shower rates .",
    "these have been discussed several times in the literature @xcite and will not be further addressed here .",
    "atmospheric air showers are produced by high energy cosmic rays that interact soon after entering the upper part of the atmosphere and they are regularly registered by air shower detectors @xcite .",
    "the atmosphere has just the adequate matter depth ( @xmath11  g  @xmath12 ) so that vertical showers fully develop not too far above ground level , where the shower front contains large numbers of gamma rays , electrons and positrons ( the electromagnetic component ) as well as muons in rough proportions 100:6:4:1 . as the arrival direction of the cosmic ray particles increases in zenith angle , @xmath13 , the slant depth to ground level rises , in proportion to @xmath14 for low zenith angles and with a modified behavior for @xmath15 because of the earth s curvature .",
    "the maximum slant depth for a completely horizontal ( @xmath16 ) shower at sea level is @xmath17  g  @xmath12 , see fig .",
    "[ slantdepth ] , about 36 ( 2 ) times larger than for vertical showers . as a result",
    "most of the electromagnetic component of showers with @xmath15 is much absorbed before reaching ground level .",
    "the analysis of the haverah park inclined data set established the cosmic ray eev background for neutrino detection @xcite .",
    "a fairly general model to describe the inclined showers induced by protons , nuclei and photons @xcite was developed which allowed the first analysis of eev data at zenith angles between @xmath16 and @xmath18on on an event by event basis .",
    "the observed rate was shown to be consistent with a baryonic origin of the cosmic rays and a limit on photon abundance above @xmath19ev was set@xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic part of cosmic ray showers at high zenith develops and gets practically absorbed in the first 2000  g  @xmath12 and to a very good approximation only muons reach the ground .",
    "the lower energy muons actually decay in flight and can contribute a small electromagnetic component that follows closely that of the muons . as a result the average energy of the muons reaching ground increases rapidly as the zenith angle rises .",
    "the magnetic field of the earth acts as a spectrometer for the surviving muons separating the negative from the positive in inverse proportion to their energy and producing complex density patterns on the ground @xcite .",
    "the shower front that reaches ground level for inclined showers is very different from vertical showers .",
    "inclined shower fronts practically only contain energetic muons and their density patterns have lost the cylindrical symmetry because of the earth s magnetic field . the degree to which this symmetry is broken depends on the relative strength and orientation of the magnetic field with respect to shower axis as well as the characteristic distance traveled by the muons which is governed by the zenith angle @xcite .",
    "studies have been made of the time structure of the shower front induced by inclined cosmic rays and deep showers  @xcite . while the former are very close to a plane front deep showers display a front with significant curvature , in similar fashion to ordinary vertical showers .",
    "this can be characterized by an effective radius of curvature that is directly related to the distance at which shower maximum is achieved .",
    "the time structure of the arriving particles has been shown to be very different because it is due to muons that are produced very far away .",
    "the muons do not have much multiple elastic scattering and , as a result , their arrival time distribution can be related to a very good approximation only to their geometrical path and the kinematic delays associated with the muon sub - luminal velocity  @xcite . at large zenith",
    "ordinary cosmic rays produce the shower muons very far from ground level and both the front curvature and its width are very small . on the contrary vertical and deep inclined showers , with large numbers of electrons , positrons and photons , display both a small radius of curvature because shower maximum is relatively close as well as a a large signal dispersion in time which increases as the distance to shower axis increases .",
    "the time structure of the showers detected with the auger observatory have shown clearly these effects @xcite .",
    "the inclined shower technique must exploit these differences to search for neutrino induced inclined air showers .",
    "a simple signature can be used : inclined showers that look like ordinary vertical showers with a significant electromagnetic component .",
    "more sophisticated analysis methods can enhance the performance of the detectors to search for deep showers for instance relating the time structure of the muons to the depth development of the shower @xcite .",
    "it has been recently shown that it is possible to establish the depth of production of the muons in a shower from the time distributions of the muons which are far from shower axis@xcite .",
    "if this technique can be effectively exploited it could allow the selection of deep showers also for showers that have had their electromagnetic component absorbed .",
    "high energy muons can produce deep air showers by bremsstrahlung , pair production and nuclear interactions .",
    "although these processes typically contribute similar amounts to muon energy loss , bremsstrahlung is the hardest process and when folded with a steeply falling atmospheric muon spectrum , is the most important for producing high energy showers .",
    "this is fact the dominant mechanism for explaining the observed inclined shower rates in the energy range between @xmath20tev and @xmath21pev @xcite .",
    "the high energy muons that are mostly traveling along the shower axis must undergo the bremsstrahlung interaction in which a large fraction of the muon energy is transferred to the photon .",
    "this must be produced at about 400  g  @xmath12 of slant depth before the muon reaches ground level , in a relatively narrow range of depth so that the shower reaches its maximum close to ground level .",
    "both bremsstrahlung and pair production will give rise to pure electromagnetic showers that would hardly contain any muons , but the hadronic interactions of the muons will produce showers that are of hadronic type .",
    "since atmospheric muons are produced in air showers these energetic muons must come from extensive air showers which exceed the muon energy by some factor , which is , incidentally , dependent on the nature of the primary particle .",
    "the hard process itself generates a sub - shower of a fraction of the muon energy which develops along shower axis .",
    "it is even possible that several of these hard muon processes combine in a single larger shower .",
    "the softer muons , which are spread laterally in patterns which are governed by the geomagnetic field , could in principle also be detected if the primary shower energy is sufficiently high .",
    "the deep showers induced by these hard processes is thus `` embedded '' in a larger shower which may or may not be detectable .",
    "if they are detected it could in principle be possible to distinguish the deep sub - shower within the cosmic ray shower which would clearly signal this kind of processes but this seems a rather difficult task . if not , it would be impossible to distinguish from a charged current electron neutrino shower for instance .",
    "fortunately the atmospheric muon flux is very soft and ( at sufficiently high energy ) the expected rate of showers from hard muon processes is expected to be very small .",
    "however the muon bremsstrahlung rate is subject to uncertainties , mainly due to the production of prompt muons through charmed mesons , a subject that has not been resolved @xcite .",
    "inclined showers of shower size between @xmath22 and @xmath23 are expected to give valuable information concerning prompt charm production @xcite .",
    "backgrounds of hard muon processes for neutrino detection in the context of the auger detector have been discussed in ref .",

    "since the average energy transfer to the nucleon is very dependent on the low @xmath32 behavior of the parton distributions in a region which is not yet accessible to accelerator experiments @xcite , it has been pointed out that simultaneous measurements of different neutrino channels could provide insight on the low-@xmath32 behavior of the parton distributions@xcite . for down - going neutrino induced air showers",
    "the interaction rate is proportional to the cross section , for earth skimming upcoming showers the cross section acts in the opposite way increasing the neutrino absorption in the earth .",

    "the regeneration is important in the 1  pev region  @xcite but for earth skimming neutrinos regeneration is most important at about @xmath151  gev as shown by simulations @xcite .",
    "these neutrinos have to interact produce a @xmath0 , exit the earth and decay in the atmosphere so that the shower energy is further reduced . since the electron is stable there is no such effect for @xmath62 while for @xmath85 the long @xmath110 lifetime results in regeneration at a low energy which is not relevant for this work",
