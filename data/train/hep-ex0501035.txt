    "the cross - section for polarized deep inelastic scattering@xcite of leptons off spin 1/2 hadrons can be expressed , at the leading twist , as a function of three independent quark distribution function : @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the latter is chiral - odd and can be measured in combination with a chiral - odd fragmentation function , the collins function @xmath5 , via azimuthal single spin asymmetries @xcite ( ssa ) in the hadronic end - product ( semi - inclusive measurement ) .",
    "a similar effect can arise from a possible quark @xmath6 structure of a transversely polarized nucleon ( the sivers function , @xmath7 ) , which also causes an azimuthal asymmetry in the produced hadrons .",
    "leptoproduction on transversely polarized nucleons is a favourable setting to disentangle the collins and sivers effects since they show a dependence from linearly independent kinematic variables .    according to collins ,",
    "the fragmentation function of a quark of flavour @xmath8 in a hadron @xmath9 can be written as@xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the final hadron transverse momentum with respect to the quark direction ",
    "i.e. the virtual photon direction  and @xmath12 is the fraction of available energy carried by the hadron ( @xmath13 is the hadron energy , @xmath14 is the incoming lepton energy and @xmath15 is the scattered lepton energy ) .",
    "the angle appearing in the fragmentation function , known as `` collins angle '' and noted as @xmath16 , is conveniently defined in the system where the z - axis is the virtual photon direction and the x - z plane is the muon scattering plane . in this frame",
    "@xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the hadron azimuthal angle , and @xmath19 is the azimuthal angle of the transverse spin of the struck quark .",
    "since @xmath20 , with @xmath21 the azimuthal angle of the transverse spin of the initial quark ( nucleon ) , the relation @xmath22 is also valid .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath23 couples to transverse spin distribution function @xmath4 and gives rise to ssa ( denoted as @xmath24 ) dependent on @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 kinematic variables .    following the sivers hypothesis ,",
    "the difference in the probability of finding an unpolarised quark of transverse momentum @xmath28 and @xmath29 inside a polarised nucleon can be written as @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the azimuthal angle of the quark with respect to the nucleon transverse spin orientation .",
    "it has been recently demonstrated by theoretical arguments @xcite , that ssa ( denoted as @xmath32 ) coming from the coupling of the sivers function with the un - polarised fragmentation function @xmath33 can be observed at the leading twist from polarised semi - inclusive dis .",
    "the compass @xcite experiment makes use of a high energy , intense , polarised muon beam naturally polarised by the @xmath34 decay mechanism .",
    "it uses the polarised target system of the smc experiment , which consists of two @xmath0lid cells , each 60 cm long , located along the beam one after the other in two separate rf cavities .",
    "data are taken therefore on the two oppositely polarised target cells simultaneously .",
    "hereby we discuss the analysis of the data collected in year 2002 with target polarisation oriented transversely to the beam direction . this sample ( about 200 pb@xmath1 in integrated luminosity )",
    "consists of two periods , each 5 days long , with two opposite settings in the target spin orientation .",
    "events were selected in which a primary vertex ( with identified beam and scattered muon ) was found in one of the two target cells with a least one outgoing hadron .",
    "a clean separation of muon and hadron samples was achieved by cuts on the amount of material traversed in the spectrometer . in addition , the kinematic cuts @xmath35(g@xmath36v@xmath37 , @xmath38 g@xmath36v/@xmath39 and @xmath40 were applied to the data to ensure a deep - inelastic sample above the region of the nuclear resonances and within the compass trigger acceptance .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath41 also serves to keep radiative corrections small .",
    "ssa have been looked for both the leading hadron in the event , and for all the hadrons .",
    "the leading hadron was determined as the most energetic non - muonic particle of the primary vertex having @xmath42 , and a transverse momentum @xmath43 g@xmath36v/@xmath44 .",
    "when all the hadrons coming from the primary vertex were considered , the @xmath26 cut was lowered to @xmath45 .",
    "the final data sample had an average values for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( g@xmath36v@xmath37 .",
    "the average value for @xmath26 and @xmath27 are @xmath49 and @xmath50 g@xmath36v/@xmath44 for the leading hadron analysis , @xmath51 and @xmath52 g@xmath36v@xmath53 in the other case . in transverse polarisation , one can write the number of events as follows : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the amplitude of the experimental asymmetry and @xmath56 is a function containing the apparatus acceptance .",
    "the former amplitude can be expressed as a function of the collins and sivers asymmetries through the expressions : @xmath57 where @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) is the polarisation of the target , @xmath60 is the spin transfer coefficient , and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the target dilution factor . to eliminate systematic effects due to acceptance , in each period the asymmetry @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) is fitted separately for the two target cells from the event flux with the two target orientations using the expression : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the ratio of the total number of events in the two target polarisation orientations .",

    "<S> compass is a fixed target experiment presently running at cern . in 2002 , 2003 , and 2004 the experiment used a 160 gev polarized muon beam coming from sps and scattered off a @xmath0lid target . </S>",
    "<S> the nucleons in the target can be polarized either longitudinally or transversely with respect to the muon beam and 20% of the running time has been devoted to transverse polarization . from the transverse polarization data collected in 2002 , which correspond to a total integrated luminosity of about 200 pb@xmath1 , the collins and the sivers asymmetries have been determined separately and the preliminary results are presented here . </S>"
