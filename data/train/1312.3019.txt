    "we investigate existence of minimizers of the energy of a liquid crystal elastomer that in the reference configuration occupies a domain @xmath7 .",
    "we assume that the total energy consists of the lagrangian contribution of the anisotropic elastomer and the landau - de gennes liquid crystal energy in the eulerian frame .",
    "the mixed lagrangian - eulerian setting of the problem requires injectivity of the deformation map . for this",
    ", we require the admissible deformation maps to have sufficent regularity and to satisfy the ciarlet - necas condition as well .",
    "this work aims at investigation the coupling of elastic energy and nematic order , and it applies to , both , thermotropic and lyotropic systems .",
    "liquid crystal elastomers are anisotropic nonlinear elastic materials , with the source of anisotropy stemming from the presence of elongated rigid monomer units , that are either inserted in the back - bone as part of the polymer main - chain or are present as side groups .",
    "they are elastic solids that may also present fluid and mixed regimes @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in nematic fluids ,",
    "molecules tend to align themselves along preferential directions but do not present ordering of centers of mass .",
    "the nature of the connections between polymer chains and rigid monomer units plays a main role in determining the behavior of liquid crystal elastomers @xcite . from a different perspective ,",
    "studies of actin and cytoskeletal networks ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) show lyotropic rigid rod systems crosslinked into networks by elastomer chains or linkers that present qualitative properties of liquid crystal elastomoers . a main feature of these networks is the average number of connections between rods and the location of these connections in the rod . these motivates us to consider two limiting types of lyotropic systems , the first one corresponding to a nematic liquid with rods weakly coupled into the network .",
    "the second case is that of a solid where rod rotation occurs uniquely as a result of elastic deformation , such as an elastomer made of material fibers .",
    "consequeantly , we postulate eulerian and lagrangian landau - de gennes liquid crystal energies , respectively , for these systems .",
    "many physical systems are found having intermediate properties between these two limiting cases , and it , then , may be appropriate to postulate the energy as a weighted sum of the eulerian and lagrangian energies , scaled according to a macroscopic parameter representing the density of crosslinks .",
    "the analogous property holds for the elastic energy of the system that we discuss in this article .",
    "the study of a lyotropic elastomer with lagrangian liquid crystal energy was carried out in previous work where we also analyzed liquid crystal phase transitions triggered by change in rod density @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we assume that the anisotropic behavior of the rigid units is represented by a liquid - like , eulerian liquid crystal energy .",
    "sufficient regularity of the deformation map is required to guarantee its invertibility , in order to pass from the current configuration of the nematic liquid crystal to the reference configuration of the elastic solid .",
    "there are two main quantities that describe the anisotropy associated with a liquid crystal elastomer : the traceless order tensor @xmath0 describing the nematic order of rigid rod units , and the positive definite step - length tensor @xmath1 that encodes the shape of the network .",
    "@xmath1 is spherical for isotropic polymers and spheroidal for uniaxial nematic elastomers , in which case , it has eigenvalues @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( double ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath10 measures the degree of anisotropy of the network , with positive values corresponding to prolate shape and negative ones to oblate . in the prolate geometry , the eigenvector @xmath11 associated with @xmath12 is the director of the theory , giving the average direction of alignment of the rods and also the direction of shape elongation of the network .",
    "it is natural to assume that @xmath1 and @xmath0 share the same eigenvectors . in this article , we set @xmath13 so as to obtain a traceless @xmath0 , from a given positive definite tensor @xmath1 ( @xcite , page 49 )",
    ". the free energy may also carry information on the anisotropy @xmath14 imprinted in the network at crosslinking the original polymer melt . in this work ,",
    "we choose @xmath15 .",
    "the standard landau - de gennes free energy density consists of the sum of scalar quadratic terms of @xmath16 and the bulk scalar function @xmath5 , usually a polynomial of the trace of powers of @xmath0 , describing the phase transition between the isotropic and the nematic phases of the liquid crystal @xcite , @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we take a departure from these forms but still keeping consistentcy with the original landau - de gennes theory .",
    "we first observe that the polynomial growth is not physically realistic , since it is expected that the energy should grow unboundedly near limiting alignment configurations . in the uniaxial case , these correspond to perfect alignment , characterized by scalar order parameter @xmath17 , and configurations where the rods are confined to the plane perpendicular to the director @xmath11 @xcite , @xcite . in terms of the order tensor , the limiting configuration is represented by the minimum eigenvalue taking the value @xmath6 .",
    "bounds on eigenvalues of @xmath0 are not part of the original theory , but are needed for it to be compatible with the maier - saupe theory from statistical physics @xcite .",
    "this turns out to be as well an essential element of our analysis . also , we take the gradient of @xmath0 with respect to space variables in the deformed configuration , in which case the coupling with the deformation gradient @xmath18 emerges naturally .",
    "it turns out that powers of gradient of @xmath0 , higher than quadratic , in the energy , are required for compactness .",
    "the elastic energy density proposed by blandon , terentjev and warner is given by the trace form @xcite : @xmath19 this is the analog of the neo - hookean energy of isotropic elasticity and is also derived from gaussian statistical mechanics .",
    "let us call @xmath20 the effective deformation tensor of the network ; of course , in general , @xmath21 is not itself a gradient .",
    "then @xmath22 motivated by the theory of existence of minimizers of isotropic nonlinear elasticity ( @xcite ) , in his phd , thesis @xcite , luo generalizes @xmath23 to polyconvex stored energy density functions @xmath24 ; that is , @xmath25 is a convex function of @xmath26 .",
    "this approach was used later in @xcite ) to model phase transitions in rod networks . in order to recover the limiting deformation gradient @xmath27 from the minimizing sequences @xmath28 ,",
    "it is necessary that the minimizing sequences @xmath29 yield a nonsingular limit .",
    "this is achieved by requiring the blowup of @xmath5 as the minimum eigenvalue of @xmath0 tends to @xmath6 , that is , @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "we point out that this lends another significance to the minimum eigenvalue limit .    in a related work",
    "@xcite , calderer and luo carried out a mixed finite element analysis of the elastomer trace energy coupled with that of the ericksen model of uniaxial nematic liquid crystals .",
    "this was later used in numerical simulations of domain formation in two - dimensional extensional deformations . from a different persepective ,",
    "a study of uniaxial elastomers with variable length director was carried out in @xcite , for a restricted set of deformation maps .",
    "let us now comment on the deeper mechanical significance of @xmath21 ( also denoted @xmath32 ) in connection with the special class of spontaneous deformation as brought up by agostiniani , desimone and teresi @xcite , @xcite .",
    "spontaneous deformations are those that do not cost any elastic energy . in uniaxial nematics , they correspond to volume preserving uniaxial extensions along the eigenvector @xmath11 , the latter being defined in the current configuration of the elastomer .",
    "( in the context of biaxial nematics , volume preserving biaxial extensions are also spontaneous deformations represented by @xmath33 , where , in its ( unit ) eigenvector representation , @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xmath36 ) .",
    "spontaneous strains have crystallographic significance in that they represent variants in domain patterns present in low energy microstructure .",
    "the chevron domains observed by sanchez and finkelman in liquid crystal elastomers realize the microstructure in these materials .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we note that @xmath32 does not represent the deformation of the elastomer with respect to the identity but with respect to spontaneous deformations @xmath37 .",
    "consequently , the trieste group also pointed out that @xmath32 is the only deformation tensor that contributes to the elastic energy of the elastomer , this energy being isotropic , since it has the same form regardless the current value of @xmath11 .",
    "these authors proposed to include as well an anisotropic component in the energy depending on @xmath38 ( [ des-12 ] ) .",
    "we observe the regularizing role of the latter part of the energy . without loss of generality , in this work , we neglect the latter term and address the more challenging problem of the energy depending only on @xmath21 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "in addition to the trace models of liquid crystal elastomer energy studied by terentjev and warner ( @xcite and references therein ) , generalizations of these earlier forms have been proposed and studied by several authors ( @xcite and @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) . in these references , the authors propose energies based on powers of the earlier trace form , including ogden type energies , and study their extensions to account for semisoft elasticity .",
    "also , the analysis of equilibrium states presented in @xcite applies to elastomer energy density functions that are not quasiconvex , these being appropriate to model crystal - like phase transitions .",
    "the types of boundary conditions that we consider include prescribing the deformation map on the boundary or part of it . in such cases",
    ", we also prescribe components of the order tensor @xmath0 there . in an alternate approach , instead of prescribing boundary conditions on @xmath0",
    ", we include a surface free energy of the rapini - papoular type .",
    "the latter also extends to those parts of the boundary with no prescribed dirichlet conditions on the deformation map .",
    "in such a case , the energy integral is formulated in terms of the _ pull - back _ order tensor @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is devoted to modeling , with special emphasis on analyzing the type of coupling between the landau - de gennes model of nematic liquid crystal and the nonlinear elasticity of the anisotropic network . in section 3 ,",
    "we study the admissible set of fields corresponding to finite energy , focusing on classes of deformation maps and boundary conditions for which the invertibility property of the maps holds .",
    "section 4 addresses minimization of the energy .",
    "the conclusions are described in section 5 .",
    "equilibrium configurations of nematic liquid crystal elastomers are characterized by the deformation gradient @xmath18 together with the symmetric tensors @xmath1 and @xmath0 , describing the shape of the material and the nematic order , respectively . within the point of view of the mean - field theory ,",
    "the state of alignment of a nematic liquid crystal is given by a probability distribution function @xmath41 in the unit sphere .",
    "the order tensor is defined as the second order moment of @xmath41 : @xmath42 from this definition , it follows that @xmath0 is a symmetric , traceless , @xmath43 matrix with bounded eigenvalues ( @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath44 for biaxial nematic , @xmath0 admits the representation @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 correspond to the biaxial order parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are unit eigenvectors . if @xmath51 , then ( [ q - biaxial ] ) yields the uniaxial order tensor @xmath52 where @xmath53 corresponds to the uniaxial nematic order parameter and @xmath54 is the unit director field of the theory .    in a rigorous study of the landau - de gennes model @xcite , majumdar observes that the definition of @xmath0 given by ( [ order - tensor ] ) is that of the maier - saupe mean - field theory @xcite . in the original theory by landau and de gennes @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xmath0 has a phenomenological role as a dielectric or magnetic susceptibility tensor , and its eigenvalues do not satisfy any inequality constraints .",
    "it is the latter that bring compatibility to these theories .    following the property of freely joined rods , we assume that @xmath1 and @xmath0 have common eigenvectors and propose the constitutive relation @xmath55 where @xmath56 is constant .",
    "the linear constitutive equation ( [ lq0 ] ) is analogous to those proposed by terentjev and warner @xcite and fried and sellers @xcite stating that , given a symmetric and traceless tensor @xmath0 and a constant @xmath57 , there is a one @xmath58-parameter family of step - length tensors @xmath1 with @xmath59 , and such that @xmath60 the form ( [ lq0 ] ) corresponds to taking @xmath61 and @xmath62    letting @xmath63 denote the eigenvalues of @xmath1 , it reduces to the uniaxial nematic with director @xmath11 and order parameter a multiple of @xmath47 in the case that @xmath64 the mechanical response of the elastomer along @xmath11 is distinguished from that along any of the transverse directions .    from the constitutive assumption ( [ lq0 ] )",
    "it follows that @xmath65 where @xmath66 stands for the minimal eigenvalue of a symmetric tensor @xmath0 .",
    "this shows another consequence of requiring @xmath67 : to gurantee the invertibility of @xmath1 , and so , to be able to recover the gradient of deformation from the effective deformation tensor @xmath21 .",
    "we assume that , in the reference configuration , a liquid crystal elastomer occupies a bounded domain @xmath7 with smooth boundary @xmath68 .",
    "we denote the deformation map of the elastomer and its gradient as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a given constant .",
    "this last constraint on the determinant expresses the maximum degree of compressibility allowed to the material .",
    "the trace - form free energy density @xmath71 expresses the coupling between the step length tensor @xmath1 and the deformation gradient @xmath18 and also encodes the anisotropy @xmath14 of the reference configuration .",
    "usually , @xmath14 is a constant positive definite symmetric tensor and , by rescaling , in what follows , we assume @xmath72 define @xmath73 .    in general , scalar functions of the invariants of the tensors @xmath74 and @xmath75 are admissible .",
    "let us examine how vectors transform in each of these cases as illustrated in figure ( [ effective - deformation - tensor ] ) .      in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose an elastomer energy of the form @xmath76 with @xmath32 representing the deformation tensor with respect to spontaneous deformations .",
    "the @xmath58-component of this energy was also analyzed in previous work @xcite , @xcite , and in @xcite and @xcite for the neo - hookean trace form of the energy . as indicated in the introduction ,",
    "these terms correspond to two limiting liquid crystal elastomer behaviors , perhaps ideal , the first corresponding to the case that the material is made of pure fibers and the second to a standard liquid crystal elastomer but showing interaction between alignment and deformation .",
    "we focus on the cases of nontrivial coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath18 and propose a landau - de gennes elastomer energy of the following form : @xmath77 where , for certain given @xmath2 and @xmath0 , @xmath78    in what follows , we denote @xmath79 the space of three - dimensional tensors and @xmath80 according to ( [ eigenvaluesq ] ) , we define @xmath81 then , for @xmath82 , it follows that @xmath83 and the tensor @xmath1 defined by ( [ lq0 ] ) is invertible .",
    "_ polyconvexity and coerciveness of @xmath84 _ : there exists a convex function @xmath87 such that @xmath84 in ( [ total - energy - lag_eul ] ) satisfies @xmath88 also , there exist constants @xmath89 such that @xmath90    _ convexity and growth of @xmath85 _ : the landau - de gennes energy function @xmath91 is convex in @xmath92 .",
