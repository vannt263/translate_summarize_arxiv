    "after the discovery of the _ attractor mechanism _ in the mid 90 s @xcite-@xcite in the context of bps black holes ( bhs ) , recently _ extremal bh attractors _ have been object of intensive study @xcite@xcite .",
    "this is mainly due to the ( re)discovery of new classes of scalar attractor configurations , which do not saturate the bps bound and , when considering a supergravity theory , break all supersymmetries at the bh event horizon .",
    "the various classes of bps and non - bps attractors are strictly related to the geometry of the scalar manifold . in @xmath10 , @xmath11 ungauged supergravity coupled to @xmath12 abelian vector multiplets , the scalar manifold is endowed with the so - called special khler ( sk ) geometry ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and refs . therein ) , in which the holomorphic prepotential function @xmath13 plays a key role . in general , sk geometry admits three classes of extremal bh attractors : @xmath14-bps ( preserving four supersymmetries out of the eight pertaining to asymptotical @xmath10 , @xmath11 superpoincar algebra , and two non - supersymmetric typologies , discriminated by the eventual vanising of the @xmath10 central charge function @xmath15 : non - bps @xmath16 and non - bps @xmath17 ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for a detailed analysis in the case of symmetric sk geometries ) .    when considering @xmath10 , @xmath11 supergravity coming from a string compactification , the perturbative quantum corrections to the holomorphic prepotential of sk geometries can be polynomials or some non - polynomial ( usually polylogarithmic ) functions of the moduli ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and refs .",
    "therein ) . in the case of cubic classical sk geometries , such as the ones obtained in the large volume limit of @xmath18-compactifications of type iia , the sub - leading nature of the quantum corrections constrains the most general polynomial correction to be at most of degree two in the moduli , with a priori complex coefficients .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the only polynomial quantum perturbative correction to the prepotential of classical cubic sk geometries which is consistent with the perturbative ( continuous ) axion - shift symmetry @xcite is the constant purely imaginary term ( @xmath19 throughout ) : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the real , constant , completely symmetric tensor defining the cubic geometry .",
    "indeed , it can be easily shown that all other polynomial perturbative corrections ( quadratic , linear and real constant terms in the moduli ) do not modify the classical cubic geometry , since they do not contribute to the khler potential at all @xcite .",
    "let us start by considering the holomorphic prepotential of a certain class of compactifications of the heterotic @xmath22 superstring over @xmath23 , having the form ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and refs . therein ) @xmath24 since in this case the dilaton @xmath25 belong to a vector multiplet , there exist ( @xmath26-symmetric ) quantum perturbative string - loop corrections and non - perturbative corrections , as well . the tree - level , classical term @xmath27 is the prepotential of the generic cubic sequence @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) of homogeneous symmetric sk manifolds ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , and @xcite and refs . therein ) , in the symplectic gauge exhibiting the largest possible amount of explicit symmetry @xmath30 .",
    "due to non - renormalization theorems , all the quantum perturbative string - loop corrections are encoded in the 1-loop contribution @xmath31 , which contains a constant term , a purely cubic polynomial term and a polylogarithmic part ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "finally , @xmath32 encodes the non - perturbative corrections , exponentially suppressed in the limit @xmath33 .    by exploiting the type iia / heterotic duality and correspondingly by suitably identifying the relevant moduli fields ,",
    "the heterotic prepotential ( [ f - heterotic ] ) becomes structurally identical to the one arising from type iia compactifications over calabi - yau threefolds ( @xmath18s ) .",
    "in such a case , the prepotential of the resulting low - energy @xmath10 , @xmath11 supergravity is purely of classical origin .",
    "indeed , there are only khler structure moduli , and the dilaton @xmath25 belongs to an hypermultiplet ; thus , there are no string - loop corrections , and all corrections to the large - volume limit cubic prepotential come from the world - sheet sigma - model @xcite . as shown in @xcite * * , * * there are no 1- , 2- and 3-loop contributions . moreover , the non - perturbative , world - sheet instanton corrections destroy continuous axion - shift symmetry , by making it discrete @xcite .    by disregarding such non - perturbative world - sheet instanton corrections ,",
    "the type iia prepotential can be written as follows ( @xmath34 ) @xcite : @xmath35 the @xmath36 are the real classical intersection numbers , determining the large volume limit cubic sk geometry .",
    "the perturbative contributions from @xmath7-dimensional cft on the world - sheet are encoded in a linear and in a constant term .",
    "the linear term is determined by the @xmath37 , which are the real expansion coefficients of the second chern class @xmath38 of @xmath18 with respect to the basis @xmath39 of the cohomology group @xmath40 , dual to the basis of the ( 1,1)-forms @xmath41 of the cohomology @xmath42 .",
    "it has been shown that the linear term @xmath43 can be reabsorbed by a suitable symplectic transformation of the period vector , and thus in the heterotic picture it has just the effect of a constant shift in @xmath44 ( @xcite * * ; * * see also @xcite ) .    from the general analysis of @xcite ,",
    "the constant term is the only relevant one .",
    "it is determined by the euler characters @xmath45 , and thus @xmath46 is of order @xmath6 .",
    "notice that @xmath47 for _ self - mirror _ @xmath18s , and thus such a constant term vanishes .",
    "moreover , for some particular _ self - mirror _ models , such as the so - called fhsv one @xcite , also the non - perturbative , world - sheet instanton corrections vanish ; thus , in such models , up to suitable symplectic transformations of the period vector , the classical cubic prepotential does not receive any perturbative and non - perturbative correction . ]",
    "@xmath48 of @xmath18 ( @xmath49 is the riemann zeta - function ) , and it has a 4-loop origin in the non - linear sigma - model @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out here that @xmath18-compactifications of type iib do not admit a large volume limit ; moreover , the attractor eqs .",
    "only depend on the complex structure moduli ( which are the scalars of the @xmath10 vector multiplets ) .",
    "the solutions to @xmath10 , @xmath11 attractor eqs . for the resulting sk geometries were studied in @xcite for the particular class of fermat @xmath18s with @xmath50 , and in @xcite for a particular @xmath18 with @xmath51 .",

    "[ quantum - non - bps ] ) charge domains .",
    "despite the simplicity of the correction added to the classical prepotential @xmath55 ( see eq . ( [ t^3 ] ) below ) , we will find evidence for interesting phenomena , such as the _ `` separation '' _ and the _ `` transmutation '' of extremal bh attractors_. finally , in subsect .",

    "this is an isolated case in the classification of the symmetric sk manifolds ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , and @xcite and refs .",

    "the reason for such a difference lies in the fact that the four charges @xmath66 sit in the spin @xmath67 real representation of @xmath68 in the former case , and in the spin @xmath14 complex representation of @xmath69 in the latter case .    at the present time",

    "since such a model does not admit non - bps @xmath17 attractors , in the following `` non - bps '' will be understood for `` non - bps @xmath16 '' .",
    "furthermore , we will always consider the simple case corresponding to the so - called `` magnetic '' charge configuration , in which the only non - vanishing bh charges are @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( in a stringy interpretation , this corresponds to consider only @xmath76 and  @xmath77 branes ) .    in the remaining of this section we will report",
