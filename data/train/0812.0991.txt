    "understanding the complex physics of galaxy formation is one of the key goals of astronomy today .",
    "observations at high - redshift show that the young universe was strikingly different than it is locally and while many high - redshift galaxy populations have low - redshift analogues , significant evolution is seen in their global properties such as their clustering strength @xcite , the shape of their luminosity function ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and their overall contribution to the integrated background light ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the stellar mass density of the universe @xcite .",
    "individually , the galaxies themselves are generally more violent and dynamic objects than typical galaxies today .",
    "they are more gas - rich , show higher levels of star formation and nucleic activity @xcite , experience increased rates of major mergers @xcite , and exhibit signs of energetic outflows @xcite . the role that these processes play in building and shaping galaxies",
    "is still poorly understood , as is the link between different evolutionary phases and the importance of properties such as mass and the local environment in driving evolution .",
    "hierarchical structure formation models predict , and observations confirm , that the first objects to form in the early universe will be highly clustered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , many studies of galaxy evolution focus on single large structures at high - redshift which , in addition to isolating the most active sites of structure formation at early times , provides large samples of equidistant galaxies over a range in mass , luminosity and evolutionary stages .",
    "such studies of high density environments have recently detected a new population of extended lyman-@xmath1 ( ly@xmath1 ) emitting nebulae at high - redshift @xcite .",
    "the properties of these so - called ly@xmath1 blobs ( labs ) indicate they are energetic phases in the formation of galaxies : they have projected physical extents of tens to several hundreds of kpc , ly@xmath1 luminosities of @xmath3 10@xmath4 erg s@xmath5 , and the ly@xmath1 emission is often morphologically irregular and dynamically complex .",
    "they are prevalent in high - density regions which exhibit other signs of intense star formation and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity , though the extent to which this is a selection effect has not been adequately explored through unbiased studies ( c.f .",
    "the largest published sample of extended labs to date is presented in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m04 ) , within the ssa22 structure at @xmath6 3.09 . originally discovered as an over - density of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) @xcite , subsequent narrow - band imaging of the ssa22 field @xcite revealed two giant labs within the concentration with sizes @xmath7 100 kpc .",
    "narrow - band imaging over a larger area by m04 assembled a sample 35 labs with sizes above a few tens of kpc and luminosities of 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "they are imbedded within a large ( @xmath7 60 mpc ) structure , traced by the fainter and smaller ly@xmath1 emitter ( lae ) population @xcite consisting of at least three dynamically distinct filaments .",
    "the two brightest two labs are located at the filamentary intersection .    clearly , the ssa22 structure is a concentration of evolutionary activity and the large number of labs within it provides us with an opportunity to conduct a more systematic study these enigmatic systems than has been done before .",
    "the primary outstanding question concerns the mechanism responsible for their intense ly@xmath1 luminosities and super - galactic sizes .",
    "while an obvious explanation is photo - ionization by an embedded source , many labs do not contain uv - bright galaxies of sufficient luminosity ( m04 ) . neither",
    "are they powered by interactions between radio - jets and the ambient inter - galactic medium as they are radio - quiet , unlike the similar ly@xmath1 halos surrounding high - redshift radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "alternative scenarios hold that these systems are powered by shock heating from galaxy - wide superwinds @xcite , driven by intense starbursts or agn @xcite , or through gravitational heating during the collapse of a large primordial cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although exceptional uv and radio sources are not in general found within labs , recent observations have shown that many ( but not necessarily all ) labs are associated with infrared luminous galaxies @xcite .",
    "the work of @xcite and @xcite detected 5 of the m04 labs at 850@xmath0 m ( @xmath7 3@xmath9 significance ) .",
    "it is notable that the submillimeter array has failed to detect the most luminous of these , lab01 ( @xmath10 = 17 mjy ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicating either extended submillimeter emission ( @xmath7 4 ) or multiple submillimeter emitters confused within the beam @xcite , a point we will return to in  4.2 .",
    "work with the mips camera on board spitzer has also revealed infrared - luminous counterparts to a number of labs including the largest currently known @xcite .",
    "these results all imply classifications of ultra-/hyper - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs / hylirgs ) , with infrared luminosities of @xmath310@xmath11 l@xmath12 .",
    "the relationship between the infrared luminous systems and their respective labs is unclear , but a weak correlation between the counterpart bolometric luminosity and the ly@xmath1 luminosity suggests that the size and luminosity of the lab is controlled by global , galactic sized processes such as super - winds .",
    "in this paper we present the first mid - infrared study of a large sample of labs within the ssa22 filament with irac @xcite and mips @xcite on board the spitzer space telescope @xcite .",
    "we use these observations , along with supplementary data from the literature , archives , and our own optical observations , to identify the galaxies which are associated with the labs and to investigate their nature and relation to the clouds . at @xmath2 3.09",
    "these data sample the rest - frame near- and mid - infrared ( nir / mir ) , and are sensitive to stellar emission , thermally radiating hot dust , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon features ( pahs ) .",
    "the broad shape of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in this region provides a useful diagnostic of the energy production mechanism within each galaxy that is complementary to the optical / uv and far - infrared observations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows :  2 describes the observations and data analysis techniques of the mid - infrared , optical and archival x - ray data ; in section  3 we present the infrared counterparts to the labs ; and  4 contains a discussion of the constraints on the nature of the counterparts , comparisons to previous studies , and implications for our understanding of the labs and their relation to galaxy formation .",
    "the spitzer irac ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath0 m ) and mips ( 24 @xmath0 m ) data are part of two gto programs , pid # 64 and # 30328 ( pi : giovanni fazio ) .",

    "this same area of @xmath3225 arcmin@xmath14 was also imaged with mips ( airids # 17600768 , 17601024 ) with an integration time of 1200 sec / pixel .",
    "the irac data were combined using mopex in tandem with the iracproc package @xcite version 4.2.1 .",
    "the pixels in the final mosaics were chosen to be 086 on a side so that the area subtended by each pixel was exactly half that of the native irac pixels .",
    "the mips data were reduced and mosaicked with the mips data analysis tool ( dat ) as described in gordon et al .",

    "photometry on the irac and mips images was performed using 3.4@xmath16 and 6@xmath16 diameter apertures respectively , and aperture corrections were applied to correct to total fluxes .",

    "the coordinate system for each exposure was refined using the usno b1 catalog and a priori knowledge of the relative orientations of the detector arrays ; absolute accuracy in the positions of objects that are well - detected in single exposures should be better than 0.2@xmath17 .    using photometry of stars common to the set of exposures ,",

    "we note however that the similar @xmath18-band flux of the ero and radio source means none of our key results are strongly dependent on this assumption .    lab01-b has not received much attention thus far , perhaps because it lies in the outer region of the ly@xmath1 cloud and @xmath37 from the submillimeter centroid .",
    "the optical and near - infrared imaging reveals two objects separated by 2@xmath16 , one of which is substantially brighter than the other and coincident with the center of the 3.6@xmath0 m emission ; hereafter we take this brighter system to be the irac source .",
    "the irac - mips photometry of lab01-a and -b are very similar : both are detected in all 4 irac filters and mips-24@xmath0 m at roughly the same flux levels . as discussed in  4 ,",
    "their infrared colors are indicative of @xmath6 3 galaxies and we here conclude that both systems are associated with the ssa22 filament and lab01 . as already noted by geach et al . , the projected separation is @xmath330 kpc and hence this may be an interacting system within the lab , though no clear evidence of this is seen in the deep optical imaging .",
    "lab01 has now been observed with a number of different submillimeter facilities .",
    "the original scuba detection @xcite is the strongest and most significant at s@xmath34 = 16.8 @xmath27 2.9 mjy , but the large beam ( fwhm @xmath3 15 ) of the jcmt at 850@xmath0 m makes the positional uncertainty significant , and it is possible that more than one source within the lab is contributing to the submillimeter flux .",
    "such a scenario would explain both the very high submillimeter emission measured by the jcmt and the recent non - detection of this lab with the submillimeter array ( sma ) @xcite .",
    "the sma observations should have detected the source , unless it was extended beyond 4 or composed of multiple fainter systems , confused within the jcmt beam , in which case the emission would be resolved by the sma below the detection threshold .",
    "the 24@xmath0 m detections of both lab01-a and -b mark them both as strong infrared emitters and thus possible submillimeter sources , and their separation of @xmath35 arcsec is certainly well below the resolution limit of scuba at 850@xmath0 m .",
    "this picture is confused however by two other data sets , which call into question the submillimeter measurements .",
    "the ovro co(4 - 3 ) observations @xcite detected a single object 2 n of the ero , which implies only a single submillimeter emitter , however the detection is only at a 3.2@xmath9 significance and thus a second source of similar flux could lie just below the detection limit of these data .",
    "recent observations taken with the aztec submillimeter array on the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment at 1 mm @xcite however failed to detect any submillimeter emission , to a 5@xmath9 limit of @xmath310 mjy @xcite . given the large beam - size of @xmath338 at 1 mm , the existence of multiple submillimeter emitters can not explain this non - detection .",
    "* lab02 : * lab02 is the second of three labs in this sample with multiple objects within its large extent .",
    "although this object has been identified as a possible submillimeter emitter , the 850@xmath0 m detection @xcite is of significance ( 2.75@xmath9 ) and we consider this an unreliable detection . as first reported by @xcite , and seen in fig .",
    "[ overlay ] , there are a number of systems detected in the irac imaging with very different observed optical and infrared colors . the brightest object in the group , object * c * in geach et al . , is a bright radio source and has @xmath35 1 and @xmath36 1 , consistent with a foreground galaxy at @xmath33 1 .",
    "source * d * ( not discussed in geach et al . ) is also consistent with a low redshift galaxy : it is detected in the optical through to 4.5@xmath0 m , with @xmath37 1 , but is not visible at 5.8@xmath0 m and 8.0@xmath0 m .",
    "the most likely physical counterparts to the lab are therefore sources * a * and * b*. lab02-a however is detected with a significance of only 4@xmath9 at 8.0@xmath0 m and thus its color , while consistent with @xmath6 3 , is poorly constrained ; for that reason although its photometry is listed in table 1 , it is considered an 8@xmath0 m non - detection for the remainder of the analysis .",
    "source lab02-b lies in the outer region of the blob .",
    "it is not detected at 24@xmath0 m but has been associated with a chandra x - ray source @xcite . using archival data , we find a 0.310 kev flux level at its coordinates of ( 2.5@xmath27 1.3)@xmath1310@xmath38 erg s@xmath5 @xmath25 using the chandra data and a power - law spectrum , consistent with the reported values of @xcite .",
    "however , we find that it has a significance of @xmath32@xmath9 in these chandra data ( the source is not picked up as significant in our detection algorithms ) and it is _ not _ detected in the xmm datasets .",
    "thus , we regard the x - ray detection as tentative : it is likely very faint and/or slightly extended so that the larger xmm psf precludes a detection there . in the latter case , a deeper chandra observations should clarify this issue .    * lab05 : * a single counterpart exists for this lab . it",

    "it is strongly detected at all wavelengths , from @xmath18 to 850@xmath0 m .",
    "the archival x - ray data have also revealed an x - ray source coincident with the irac position , heretofore unpublished .",
    "the object was detected with significances of @xmath32.5@xmath9 in _ both _ acis and mos instruments ( unfortunately it fell in between chip gaps in the pn instrument ) and we thus consider it a very solid detection with a 0.3 - 10 kev flux level of 2.1@xmath270.8 @xmath13 10@xmath38 erg / s / cm@xmath15    * lab16 : * a counterpart is detected in all four irac filters , as well as mips 24@xmath0 m .",
    "the peak ly@xmath1 flux is offset from the @xmath18 and 3.6@xmath0m/4.5@xmath0 m counterpart by @xmath32@xmath17 ; this may also be the case at the longer wavelengths , @xmath78.0@xmath0 m , but the centroid poorly determined because of the lower s / n and the larger psf . * lab18 : * this lab is detected at all infrared wavelengths , though is slightly confused by a foreground neighbor at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "lab18 has no obvious single @xmath18-band counterpart , but diffuse emission along the extent of the lab is clearly visible . in figure [ overlay ]",
    "we see two additional objects south of the main lab emission which are detected at all four irac wavelengths , though not in the @xmath18 image , nor at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "the southern - most object is coincident with another ly@xmath1 peak and has irac colors similar to the main lab counterpart and consistent with a @xmath6 3 galaxy ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "the fainter , middle source however , shows no ly@xmath1 flux and its color is contaminated by the main lab counterpart , and we therefore have not included it as an lab counterpart , although these three object may form a single interacting system .",
    "this lab has a submillimeter detection of @xmath10 = 11 mjy , and with a separation of 7 , both irac sources could contribute to the measured submillimeter flux , as may be the case with lab01 .",
    "at @xmath6 3 the irac filters sample the rest - frame nir . in this region",
    "pure stellar populations are characterized by the stellar bump at 1.6@xmath0 m , with decreasing emission toward longer wavelengths .",
    "if cold dust is present within a galaxy , band emission from pahs becomes important over the range of @xmath3 6 - 11 @xmath0 m while warm dust produces emission that continues to rise as a power - law longward of 1.6@xmath0 m ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these distinctly different sed shapes can , in principle , be exploited to diagnose the dominant power source of a galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but do suffer from important ambiguities and limitations , in particular beyond @xmath6 2 .",
    "in particular , red rest - frame nir colors only indicate the presence of warm dust , and can not discriminate between an agn , with a nuclear warm dust component and an extreme infrared - luminous starburst whose warm dust is associated with hii regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the separation of infrared - luminous galaxies into agn and star - bursting systems is regardless an over - simplification , since the most luminous ulirgs at low and high redshifts show evidence for both agn activity and intense star formation and the optical / nir emission will contain contributions from both processes .",
    "nevertheless , an investigation of the rest - frame nir - mir sed shapes can provide basic clues to the nature of the galaxies residing within labs .    in figure [ cc ]",
    "we show an irac color - color diagram for lab counterparts detected in all four irac filters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed above , infrared power - law galaxies at low and high redshift inhabit a specific region of the diagram that is generally distinct from galaxies dominated by stellar emission in the optical / infrared , but which overlaps with the location of high - redshift star - forming ulirgs . to illustrate this we plot the observed infrared colors of two representative seds with redshift , from @xmath40 0 to @xmath40 3.09 : the ulirg arp220 and a typical irregular starburst galaxy from @xcite .",
    "also shown are the observed infrared colors of 8@xmath0m - bright lbgs within the ssa22 structure @xcite and the general 8@xmath0m - selected population in the ssa22 field .    the lbgs exhibit rest - frame optical / nir colors spanning almost an order of magnitude ; while the bulk of the objects have colors consistent with a @xmath6 3 blue starburst galaxy , a number extend into the region of the diagram inhabited by ulirgs and agn .",
    "the lab counterparts on the other hand are found without exception in the region of the redder lbgs and agn / ulirg templates and are not well described by a low - extinction starburst .",
    "in addition to the ulirg / agn ambiguity , it is also difficult to constrain the redshifts using the observed nir colors : pure power - law systems in particular have a flat color - redshift relation .",
    "nevertheless , one can see from figure [ cc ] that among the 8@xmath0m - selected population power - law ( and power - law - like ) galaxies are rare ( @xmath310% ) and thus the likelihood that all five labs have a randomly aligned unassociated power - law galaxy ( and two in the case of lab01 ) within the extent of the lyman-@xmath1 emission is remote ( @xmath41 1% assuming a generous alignment distance of 5@xmath17 ) , and we therefore conclude that all seven systems have @xmath2 3 and are associated with their parent lab .",
    "although the majority of the labs were not detected in all four irac filters , nor mips 24@xmath0 m , we can still place constraints on their average properties through a stacking analysis of their infrared emission .",
    "for this exercise we take as the source position the coordinates of the 3.6@xmath0 m counterpart when available ( the majority of the labs ) or if no counterpart exists at 3.6@xmath0 m we simply take the peak of the ly@xmath1 emission ; only 1 lab is too extended to identify a clear peak / center and has no clear counterpart ( lab27 ) , resulting in a sample of 20 systems , including lab02-a .",
    "we detect stacked emission at @xmath7 5@xmath9 in all four irac filters and show the average color of the infrared - faint lab systems in figure [ cc ] .",
    "as we see , they are not simply lower luminosity versions of the 8@xmath0 m detected labs , but rather are similar in color to the blue 8@xmath0m - detected lbg population , implying they are more moderate starburst systems .",
    "returning to the infrared - bright labs , the observed nir colors require the presence of hot dust , heated by either extreme dust - enshrouded star formation or feedback from a central agn .",
    "as we now discuss however , the x - ray and mir data indicate that agn are present in some of these systems .",
    "first , turning to the x - ray results , two of the ten lbgs in this region are previously known optically confirmed qsos @xcite which are strong x - ray emitters , and two of the seven lab counterparts have weak x - ray emission ( see  3 ) .",
    "here we use the @xcite agn / starburst classification scheme where a galaxy is considered an agn if it satisfies any one of five x - ray or spectral conditions .",
    "two of these conditions are l@xmath42 3@xmath1310@xmath43 erg / s and @xmath44 which are satisfied by the two x - ray detected labs ( l@xmath45 4@xmath1310@xmath46 erg / s and @xmath47 1.5 ) .",
    "the individual and stacked x - ray limits for the remaining labs are generous ( l@xmath48 8@xmath1310@xmath46 erg / s and l@xmath48 6@xmath1310@xmath43 erg / s respectively ) and are consistent with agn according to these criteria .",
    "deeper x - ray studies ( geach et al . 2008 , in preparation ) will clarify this issue .    in figure [ iracmips ]",
    "we look at the constraints placed by the 24@xmath0 m data through an investigation of the irac - mips colors . here",
    "we are limited to the lab and lbg comparison systems which are also detected at 24@xmath0 m .",
    "agn - dominated systems generally inhabit the lower right of this diagram : hot dust enhances their observed 8@xmath0 m flux ( 2@xmath0 m in the rest - frame ) over the shorter wavelength stellar emission , but the lack of strong pah features results in blue 24@xmath0m-8@xmath0 m colors , with some variation due to the steepness of the power - law .",
    "star forming systems , on the other hand have less enhanced observed 8@xmath0 m ( rest - frame 2@xmath0 ) emission , and thus blue 8.0@xmath0m-4.5@xmath0 m colors , but exhibit a wide variety of pah strengths and therefore a range in 24@xmath0m-8@xmath0 m colors .",
    "such a diagram has been used by other authors to attempt to identify the power sources within the very luminous smg population ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which contain agn and star - formation contributions , sometimes within the same objects , and , as seen in figure [ iracmips ] , tend to populate the entire color space .",
    "we see a clear separation of agn and star - forming systems within the 24@xmath0m - bright lbg population .",
    "it is interesting to see that the lab counterparts occupy a small region of the color - space , and transition between these two populations .",
    "thus while smoking - gun evidence of agn in these systems is lacking , they appear distinct from the presumably pure star - forming lbg galaxies , but are also exhibit bluer nir colors than agn .",
    "we again perform a stacking analysis on the infrared faint labs , this time restricting the sample to those which fall on the mips image .",
    "no mips flux is detected from these systems as a whole and we place an upper - limit on their observed 24@xmath0m/8@xmath0 m color on figure [ iracmips ] . here",
    "the separation between the infrared - bright and -faint labs is less clear , though the infrared - faint labs again lie blue - ward of the infrared - bright systems , toward the star - forming region of the diagram .",
    "@xcite observed 25 of the 35 labs from @xcite at 850@xmath0 m and detected 5 at @xmath7 3@xmath9 significance .",
    "one of these , lab10 , lies outside of our imaged region .",
    "we find an almost one to one correspondence between the 8@xmath0 m and 24@xmath0 m detections presented here and the submillimeter detections .",
    "we recover all 4 of the 850@xmath0 m sources ( for which we have data ) at 8@xmath0 m . at 24@xmath0 m",
    "we fail to detect only lab05 ( limits are given in table 1 ) .",
    "the 24@xmath0m-850@xmath0 m flux ratios or limits are in good agreement with those measured for @xmath6 3 smgs ( @xmath28 0.02 ) by @xcite . as extensively discussed by @xcite such low values are consistent with galaxies such as arp220 and mrk273 , which are not typical ulirgs , and indicate higher levels of extinction and/or cooler dust temperatures than generally seen for ulirgs .",
    "cooler dust temperatures may be reached if the dust is spatially extended compared to local compact ulirgs .",
    "this explanation is particularly interesting for lab01 : recent observations with the sma @xcite have failed to detect the @xmath49 17@xmath0jy source in the blob and this places a lower limit on its spatial extent of @xmath7 4 in the submillimeter ( assuming it is signal dust enshrouded system ) .",
    "such an explanation however can not account for the failure of recent aste - aztec observations to detect this source with a 5@xmath9 limit of @xmath3 10mjy @xcite .    as we showed in the previous section the 8@xmath0 m flux of the 8@xmath0m - detected systems",
    "can not be due only to stellar emission , but must be enhanced by the presence of hot dust , associated with prodigious star formation or due to a central dust enshrouded agn .",
    "we have not detected any 8@xmath0 m source within an lab which is not also detected at 850@xmath0 m , with the exception of lab16 , whose 850@xmath0 m limit is 4@xmath13 higher than the 4 other 850@xmath0 m sources .    adopting the average 850@xmath0m-8@xmath0 m color for the infrared - bright labs , a non - detection at 850@xmath0 m of @xmath28 3mjy ( the approximate depth of geach et al . ) would lie below our 8@xmath0 m detection limit and therefore , based on this color alone , the infrared - faint labs could simply be lower luminosity versions of the same kinds of systems .",
    "a non - detection at 850@xmath0 m @xcite and 24@xmath0 m ( this work ) does not place very stringent limits on the bolometric luminosities of these systems however , and they remain compatible with ulirg - level luminosities .",
    "alternatively , the infrared - faint systems could be starburst galaxies with low extinction levels and correspondingly lower 850@xmath0m-8@xmath0 m ratios .",
    "this scenario is in agreement with the stacked measurement on figure [ cc ] and with the additional color results discussed in the following sections .",
    "we can rule out with certainty however , dust enshrouded qsos of similar rest - frame 2@xmath0 m luminosities , but which lack an extended cold dust component .      the bulk of the lab sample is not detected longward of 4.5@xmath0 m , and in addition to the stacking analysis of the previous sections we can also look to the combination of 3.6@xmath0 m and/or 4.5@xmath0 m data with the nir and optical imaging . in figure [ ccr ]",
    "we show a rest - frame uv / optical / nir color - color diagram for the lbgs and labs . here again , we see a clear separation between 8@xmath0m - detected and non - detected systems , be they labs or lbgs .",
    "the infrared - bright galaxies continue to show red colors into the rest - frame uv , indicating either older stellar populations and/or high levels of extinction .",
    "notably , as seen in fig [ cc ] the infrared - faint labs are well - separated in color from the infrared - bright systems , and are very similar to the general infrared - faint lbgs .",
    "the exceptions are the two infrared - bright lbg - qsos , which show extremely blue uv / optical colors .    in figure [ cm ]",
    "we show the observed 8.0@xmath0m/3.6@xmath0 m flux ratio as a function of observed 8.0@xmath0 m and , alternately , 3.6@xmath0 m flux .",
    "again we compare to the lbg population , and add to the analysis the smgs and qsos as in figure [ iracmips ] .",
    "in figure [ cm](a ) we see a correlation between the rest - frame 2.0@xmath0 m and the rest - frame nir / optical colors , in the sense that galaxies which are more luminous at 2.0@xmath0 m exhibit redder colors , and the stacking analysis confirms that this relation continues to fainter levels .",
    "visually , the slope of the relation appears to lie between a flat color - luminosity relation and that of the line representing constant 3.6@xmath0 m flux ; that is , the relation results from an overall increase in luminosity and a enhancement of the 2.0@xmath0 m flux over the rest - frame optical .",
    "the rest - frame @xmath3 2.0@xmath0 m is often taken as a proxy for stellar mass , however we have already argued that this wavelength is contaminated by agn or intense star - formation in many of these systems . indeed ,",
    "the most luminous systems at observed 8.0@xmath0 m are the confirmed qsos , followed by the labs and then the infrared - bright lbg population .",
    "though clearly not a complete comparison sample this does again hint that the labs are transition objects between pure agn and star - formation dominated systems .",
    "in figure [ cm](b ) we plot the same color , but now against observed 3.6@xmath0 m flux .",
    "in addition to illustrating the spread in 3.6@xmath0 m luminosities , this allows us to probe the observed 8@xmath0 m flux of the comparison lbg population as a function of 3.6@xmath0 m flux .",
    "the statistical detection of the 8@xmath0m - faint labs fits within the general behavior of the lbgs , which become markedly bluer in the optical / nir with decreasing 3.6@xmath0 m luminosity .",
    "thus , the fainter , presumably less massive systems contain lower levels of dust , star formation and agn activity .    [",
    "[ lyalpha - excitation - mechanisms - and - implications - for - galaxy - evolution - within - the - ssa22-structure ] ] ly@xmath1 excitation mechanisms and implications for galaxy evolution within the ssa22 structure ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    the two central questions concerning labs are : what drives the extended ly@xmath1 emission and , more generally , how are these structures related to galaxy formation ?",
    "there are two basic scenarios for the relationship between the labs and their counterpart galaxies . in the first , the embedded object is the excitation power source through processes such as photoionization by a strong uv emitter or by shock - heating due to super - galactic scale winds from a very strong starburst or a central agn . in the second scenario , the ly@xmath1 emision could be due to heating through gravitational collapse ; in such a picture , the lab and counterpart have no causal relationship ( that is , the galaxy is not driving the ly@xmath1 emission ) , but rather both mark sites of galaxy formation activity . in either case we might expect a correlation between the properties of the counterpart and the ly@xmath1 halo ; in the first case the correlation is obvious and causal while in the second case we might , for example , expect the most massive and luminous labs to trace regions of correspondingly massive galaxy formation activity such as major - mergers , agn , and extreme infrared starbursts .",
    "much work has been done to attempt to separate these different scenarios , but no common picture which works for all labs has yet emerged .",
    "m04 extensively discussed the possible excitation mechanisms of the 35 labs in ssa22 . using simple assumptions , such as a salpeter imf and an unhindered line of sight",
    ", they showed that @xmath3 1/3 of the labs do not contain galaxies which are sufficiently uv - luminous to power the labs .",
    "of the six 8@xmath0m - detected labs discussed here , four ( lab01 , lab02 , lab05 , lab14 ) are not sufficiently bright in the rest - frame uv unless the bulk of the ionizing radiation is emitted away from our line of sight .",
    "this is not an unreasonable explanation since all six objects are dusty and ir - luminous , as evidenced by their 8@xmath0 m , 24@xmath0 m , and/or 850@xmath0 m emission .",
    "the remaining labs however , have uv / optical / ir colors which imply lower levels of dust extinction and are therefore unlikely to be highly obscured , but still lack obvious uv emitters .    by probing both hot and cold dust emission a number of authors @xcite",
    "have shown that a small fraction of labs host infrared - bright systems of ulirg and hylirg luminosity levels and importantly , that the inferred bolometric luminosity of these systems is weakly correlated with the ly@xmath1 luminosity , though roughly three orders of magnitude larger . to the infrared - bright sample of @xcite",
    "we add lab16 ; although not detected at 850@xmath0 m we may extrapolate from the 24@xmath0 m flux ( assuming a similar sed as the other infrared - bright labs ) and find that lab16 follows the roughly same l@xmath50-l@xmath51 relation . as argued by @xcite",
    ", this suggests that the process which heats the dust , i.e.  a powerful agn or intense star formation , is also responsible for exciting the gas halo , and a natural mechanism for this is galaxy - scale winds ; however , this relation could simply indicate a natural non - causal correlation between the size of the collapsing gas cloud and the galaxy formation activity occurring within it .",
    "we can use the data presented here to add to these studies by directly probing the nature of the lab counterparts , though as with the earlier work this can not prove a causal connection between the embedded galaxy and the gas emission . throughout the paper",
    "however we have included similar analyses on the lbg population within the ssa22 structure , with the motivation that a comparative study of those systems which do not exhibit extended ly@xmath1 emission might further elucidate the processes responsible for the labs .",
    "we can divide the sample into two distinct groups : those systems , be they lbgs or labs , which are detected at 8@xmath0 m , hereafter referred to as infrared - luminous ( il ) , and galaxies which are not detected at 8@xmath0 m , or infrared - faint ( if ) .",
    "let us first discuss the il sample .",
    "the mir / nir colors of the lbgs and labs within this group are similar and are best described by either a dusty agn power - law or an intense starburst ulirg .",
    "some of these have been detected in the x - ray with emission levels consistent with though not uniquely indicative of agn .",
    "differences begin to arise when we look at the uv / optical colors or include the rest - frame 6@xmath0 m in the analysis ( figures [ ccr ] and [ iracmips ] ) .",
    "the bulk of the lbg population is systematically bluer in uv / optical color than the labs , while in mir color there is a clear continuum of colors between the bulk of the lbgs , the labs and the lbg - qsos .",
    "finally , in figure [ cm ] we see hints of a similar gradient in rest - frame 2@xmath0 m luminosity , such that the labs lie between the confirmed lbg - qso and the remainder of the lbg population .",
    "this hints that , like the smg population , il - labs may harbor deeply enshrouded agn , in addition to intense star formation .    the following toy - model might therefore be proposed for these systems .",
    "the most luminous labs are powered through galaxy - scale superwinds driven by intense star formation and agn activity .",
    "as the agn grows it eventually becomes powerful enough to completely blow - out the gas cloud and enshrouding dust and emerges as a naked agn , still luminous at the shorter ir wavelengths but no longer an lab .",
    "it is not clear from these data how the il - lbgs fit into this picture . as suggested by @xcite",
    ", one might speculate that the brightest lbgs are older systems whose agn has turned off , hence their lower 8@xmath0 m fluxes , but whether a lab phase is common to all lbgs is not yet clear .",
    "this scenario could however account for the variety of morphologies of the labs and the location of the galaxies within them .",
    "take for example the three largest labs , lab01 , lab02 and the lab of @xcite : all have likely agn counterparts near the edge of the ly@xmath1 emission , and these may be systems caught in the process of emerging from their parent cloud .",
    "one might posit that an agn is required to power the intense ly@xmath1 emission , and this is the root of the difference between the lbg without extended ly@xmath1 emission and lab populations .",
    "this seems at odds however , with the if systems .",
    "though the data are sparse for these groups , we see no difference between the properties of the if lab counterparts and the if lbgs : both appear to be pure star - forming systems with roughly similar masses ( now using the 8@xmath0 m luminosity as a proxy for mass ) . in these systems",
    "agn are not driving the ly@xmath1 emission , nor can the presence of a ly@xmath1 halo for one group but not the other be explained by obvious differences in their counterpart properties .",
    "it seems more likely therefore that the difference is in evolutionary phase over a cross - section of masses ; those galaxies with extended ly@xmath1 emission are in earlier phases of formation than the older lbgs . in this case",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission could be powered by superwinds , as discussed above , or may be unrelated to ( but still correlated with ) the embedded galaxies and driven instead by gravitational heating , as suggested , for example , by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "again , however , such a scenario would seem to imply that an lab phase is common to all systems , unless secondary factors such as morphology play a role .",
    "we have used mid - infrared imaging from spitzer irac and mips 24@xmath0 m to investigate the nature of a large sample of lab systems within the ssa22 filament at @xmath40 3.09 .",
    "we have detected 6/26 of the objects in all four irac filters , with four also detected with mips 24@xmath0 m , and find excellent correspondence with the 850@xmath0 m detections of @xcite . by analyzing the rest - frame uv , optical , and near / mid / far - infrared colors , and archival x - ray imaging ,",
    "we show that these six systems exhibit signs of agn activity and/or intense and dusty star formation ; notably , they exhibit colors which bridge the star - forming lbg galaxies within the ssa22 structure and objects optically identified as qsos . through a stacking analysis",
    "see that the infrared faint labs are markedly different than the infrared - luminous systems , and are consistent with blue star - forming galaxies , with no evidence of an agn contribution .",
    "these results are in line with a model in which the lab ly@xmath1 luminosity is powered by large - scale superwinds , driven by star - formation in the smaller systems and a combination of agn and extreme starbursts in the most massive .",
    "the presence of such a halo may be dictated by the evolutionary phase of the galaxy , such that the halo - less lbgs are older systems than the labs .",
    "a scenario in which the lab is the result of gravitational heating and the galactic activity is not driving the lab luminosity can not be ruled out , however .",

    "<S> we present the results of a spitzer irac and mips 24@xmath0 m study of extended lyman-@xmath1 clouds ( or lyman-@xmath1 blobs , labs ) within the ssa22 filamentary structure at @xmath2 3.09 . </S>",
    "<S> we detect 6/26 labs in all irac filters , four of which are also detected at 24@xmath0 m , and find good correspondence with the 850@xmath0 m measurements of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an analysis of the rest - frame ultraviolet , optical , near- and mid - infrared colors reveals that these six systems exhibit signs of nuclear activity ( agn ) and/or extreme star formation . </S>",
    "<S> notably , they have properties that bridge galaxies dominated by star formation ( lyman - break galaxies ; lbgs ) and those with agns ( lbgs classified as qsos ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lab systems not detected in all four irac bands , on the other hand , are , as a group , consistent with pure star forming systems , similar to the majority of the lbgs within the filament . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that the galaxies within labs do not comprise a homogeneous population , though they are also consistent with scenarios in which the gas halos are ionized through a common mechanism such as galaxy - scale winds driven by the galaxies within them , or gravitational heating of the collapsing cloud itself . </S>"
