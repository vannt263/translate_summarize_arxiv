    "since the brownian motion has the strong markov property and the `` discounting term '' @xmath32 can be considered as exponential killing , we can analyze the terms in the sum independently .",
    "this means that on the stochastic set @xmath33 we can consider the corresponding yukawa equation , or brownian motion with exponential killing .",

    "the algorithm is an extension of the classical walk of spheres algorithm ( wos ) due to muller @xcite .",
    "the general formula for the schrdinger equation provides an obvious way to solve the boundary value problem by simulating brownian particles . indeed , let @xmath48 , @xmath49 be independent simulated brownian trajectories starting from @xmath50 with time - mesh @xmath51",
    "so , each @xmath48 is an independent varying - length vector @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 @xmath55 s are independent standard @xmath17-dimensional normal random variables , and @xmath56 is the first index @xmath57 such that @xmath58 .",

    "the obvious problem in the general simulation method described above is that it is computationally very heavy .",
    "however , since the solution of the schrdinger equation depends on the entire path of the brownian motion , there seems to be no other way than take the @xmath51 to be very small .",
    "consequently , finding an efficient simulation algorithm for the general schrdinger equation by using the brownian motion seems a very challenging problem , indeed .",
    "let us then consider the special case of the schrdinger equation , where @xmath4 is of the form .",
    "this means that we have the yukawa equation with different parameters in different regions . in this case",
    ", we can sometimes avoid simulating the brownian particles in a fine time - mesh by killing the particle in the region with exponential clock .",
    "the idea of the simulation is comes from the following representation of the solutions , which follows from ( * ? ? ?",

    "once the particle is well inside a domain @xmath83 , we can generate a new particle by using the corresponding harmonic measure and the @xmath84-panharmonic radon  nikodym derivative as before .",
    "the harmonic measures and panharmonic radon  nikodym derivatives are not known for arbitrary domain .",
    "this limits the applicability of the idea above .",
    "however , for balls @xmath85 the radon  nikodym derivative @xmath86 , @xmath46 is well - known .",
    "indeed , by the rotational symmetry of the brownian motion the radon  nikodym derivative is independent of @xmath87 and by the self - similarity of the brownian motion @xmath88 where @xmath89 the function @xmath90 is the laplace transform of the first hitting time of a bessel process on the level @xmath91 starting from @xmath92 .",

    "in this section , we present examples to motivate our algorithm and to illustrate its potential applications in one and two - dimensional settings . these examples were computed by using a simple implementation algorithms on mathematica , and they mainly chosen from the point of view of visualisation .",
    "it should be noted that our approach is obviously more much attractive in higher dimensions , where many other methods for solving such are not available , or lead into excessive computation times .",
    "next we consider the equation in the case where @xmath112\\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] and @xmath113 $ ] is a real interval , i.e. , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is as in .",

    "one should note that the theory of impulsive differential equations is much richer than the corresponding theory of differential equations without impulse effects .",
    "for example , initial value problems of such equations may not , in general , possess any solutions at all even when the corresponding differential equation is smooth enough , fundamental properties such as continuous dependence relative to initial data may be violated , and qualitative properties like stability may need a suitable new interpretation .",
    "moreover , a simple impulsive differential equation may exhibit several new phenomena such as rhythmical beating , merging of solutions , and noncontinuability of solutions .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for more information about impulsive differential equations .",
    "however , these problems do not arise in the case of as , the boundary value problem has a continuous weak solution , and it coincides piecewise with the classical solution .",
    "the following algorithm is for the special case with @xmath121 and @xmath122 to efficiently simulate the particles we combine the gambler s ruin ( i.e. , the harmonic measure ) outside the killing zone and the kwos algorithm [ alg : kwos ] inside the killing zone .",
