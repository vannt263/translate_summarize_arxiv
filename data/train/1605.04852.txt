    "given the inherent complexity of fluid flow , the scarcity of closed - form solutions to its equations of motion , and the computational expense of large - scale numerical simulation , it is often practical to seek empirical models with a limited number of degrees of freedom , that is `` low - dimensional '' models .",
    "ideally , such models would require less input information than the full velocity field , but would characterize the essential flow dynamics .",
    "the input could come from either simulation or experiment , and the model could be used to forecast future flow states or to estimate the flow at the present time in regions which have not been measured directly . here and throughout , we consider flows in the usual three _ spatial _ dimensions ; all subsequent discussion of dimensionality refers to the phase space required to represent the system , or equivalently , the number of parameters used to represent the flow .",
    "many low - dimensional models for fluid dynamical systems have been developed in previous work . here",
    "we will focus on a particular problem : building low - dimensional models of thermal convection in a cylindrical vessel from experimental measurements .",
    "historically , we might consider the first modern low - dimensional convection model to be that of @xcite , whose three - parameter model for atmospheric convection displayed such a strikingly sensitive dependence to initial conditions that it spurred a new understanding of fluid dynamics in terms of chaos and dynamical systems theory .",
    "lorenz built his model by writing the equations of motion for convection in spectral form ( that is , as a superposition of flow modes with different wave numbers ) and truncating the equations to just three modes .",
    "later , @xcite produced a six - mode truncation that captured more intricate dynamics , and @xcite showed that retaining a seventh mode produced the lowest - dimensional truncated model that conserves total energy in the dissipationless limit .",
    "many convection models have focused on the large - scale circulation , whose shape is a single , large roll that nearly fills the container .",
    "( the large - scale circulation is also called the mean wind or the wind of turbulence . ) @xcite used laboratory measurements to build a model for the large - scale circulation and attributed reversals of the large - scale circulation to imbalance between buoyancy and friction .",
    "@xcite found that reversals were well - modeled by a set of stochastic differential equations .",
    "@xcite also built a model from stochastic ordinary differential equations , using one for flow strength and another for flow orientation , and found predictions consistent with their experimental measurements .",
    "models of many fluid systems , including thermal convection systems , are frequently constructed using proper orthogonal decomposition  @xcite , balanced proper orthogonal decomposition  @xcite , and related techniques .",
    "@xcite constructed a low - dimensional model for convection in a cylinder whose upper and lower surfaces counter - rotate and found that a model with 41 degrees of freedom successfully reproduced the representative states considered .",
    "@xcite constructed a low - dimensional model for convection in a square domain by projecting simulation data onto a set of basis modes found via proper orthogonal decomposition .",
    "@xcite used a similar procedure to produce a model applicable in a more complex domain having inlets , outlets , and localized heat sources .",
    "if we have only experimental measurements as inputs , then model construction methods which require high - resolution _ a priori _ simulations spanning space and time ( like proper orthogonal decomposition ) are unavailable to us .",
    "we have been initially motivated by characterizing the flow in liquid metal batteries  @xcite , which are built with cylindrical shapes having different aspect ratios than the most commonly studied convection systems , and which are subject additional physical processes ; their dominant flow features have not yet been characterized with low dimensional models .",
    "the general method that we describe herein has direct application to these systems .",
    "a rational and systematic procedure for producing low - dimensional models , without prior simulation results or knowledge of dominant flow features , is galerkin projection  @xcite , in which numerical or experimental measurements are represented as a superposition of weighted basis modes .",
    "the weights of the modes then express the information contained in the measurements , just as a fourier transform expresses the information contained in the function from which it is produced .",
    "truncating the projection to a small number of modes produces a low - dimensional model , in which only the degrees of freedom associated with the remaining modes are considered .",
    "galerkin projection also allows making estimates at locations other than those where measurements were collected , by summing the weighted modes . performing a galerkin projection",
    ", however , requires an appropriate set of modes .",
    "though similar considerations apply across a diverse array of other applications beyond fluid mechanics , there has been very little work on these methods in cylindrical coordinates for three spatial dimensions .",
    "one exception is @xcite , in the context of image processing .    in the present paper",
    "we construct a basis set appropriate for low - dimensional models of fluid flow , including convection , in cylindrical geometry .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : projection ] with the mathematical background necessary for projecting convection measurements onto a basis set , which identifies the required characteristics for the basis . in ",
    "[ sec : constructing ] , we show how to construct a vector - valued basis set in which every mode satisfies no - slip boundary conditions and is orthogonal to every other mode , as desired for flow modeling . we provide a few examples of vector cylindrical harmonics and discuss the properties of the basis . in ",
    "[ sec : example ] , we demonstrate the use of the basis via galerkin projection of one velocity field , taken from a simulation of convection in a cylindrical container . characteristics of the resulting modal weights are considered . by truncating the projections to varying mode counts",
    ", we consider how the fidelity of a low - dimensional model depends on its dimensionality ( that is , the number of parameters ) , at least for this set of measurements .",
    "finally , we close with  [ sec : conclusions ] , which summarizes our conclusions and points out opportunities for future work .",
    "given a set of scalar basis modes @xmath0 , any scalar quantity @xmath1 measured at locations @xmath2 ( where each @xmath3 labels a different point in space ) can be written as a superposition of weighted modes @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mode count and @xmath6 is the scalar weight of the @xmath7 mode .",
    "a fourier series is one example of such a superposition , in which the modes @xmath0 are sinusoids .",
    "finite _ mode count @xmath5 may not allow an exact match between the measurements and their reproduction in terms of the basis modes . then , the representation in eq .",
    "[ eq : superposition ] is only approximate , and the squared error is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of measurements .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the error @xmath10 is minimized by the particular values of the weights @xmath6 that satisfy the matrix equations @xmath11 known as the `` normal equations '' of the linear , least - squares fit .",
    "minimizing the error is mathematically identical to maximizing the probability that the weights @xmath6 correctly model the measured data , assuming gaussian errors .",
    "it is often convenient to solve eq .",
    "[ eq : normal ] via singular value decomposition  @xcite , and we require @xmath12 . choosing @xmath13 provides a systematic and natural technique for constructing a low - dimensional model of the original measurements @xmath1 .",
    "galerkin projection ( also known as least - squares projection ) requires , however , that the basis modes @xmath14 be orthogonal and span the domain @xmath2 . reproducing arbitrary measurements @xmath1 to maximal accuracy",
    "also requires that the basis set be complete and that @xmath15 .",
    "however , as we shall see , explicit demonstration of completeness is not required for the method to yield practical results in a given application .",
    "our goal is to model velocity fields of a convecting system in a cylindrical vessel . because velocity is a vector , we require a vector - valued basis set . considering a cylindrical vessel , we seek a basis set defined in terms of cylindrical coordinates @xmath16 , made dimensionless so that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "( cylindrical containers of other sizes and other aspect ratios can be accommodated by scaling . ) two vector basis modes @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( here labeled generically with a single subscript ) are orthogonal if and only if the volume integral of their product vanishes for non - identical modes ( @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 working with experimental measurements , we consider no - slip boundary conditions at the outer radius of the cylindrical volume .",
    "thus we would prefer to ensure such a boundary condition by finding modes that satisfy @xmath23 for any @xmath24 .",
    "in general , we also prefer a basis set that is complete so that it can represent _ any _ incompressible vector field in the spatial domain .    though galerkin projection is a well - known technique , we found it necessary to devise a new basis set after finding no existing basis sets with all of the desired characteristics for three - dimensional cylinders .",
    "our approach was initially inspired by vector _ spherical _",
    "harmonics  @xcite , widely used for spectral simulations in atmospheres  @xcite , oceans  @xcite , planetary cores  @xcite , solar convection and dynamos  @xcite and helioseismology  @xcite in spherical coordinates .",
    "vector spherical harmonics are also useful for producing low - dimensional models from laboratory measurements of velocity fields and magnetic fields in spherical systems  @xcite .",
    "vector spherical harmonics are vector - valued , mutually orthogonal , and have the proper periodic boundary conditions for representing functions on the surface of any sphere . additionally , because vector spherical harmonics are constructed via curls , each harmonic individually has zero divergence , making them useful for representing incompressible flows and magnetic fields .",
    "one might expect to produce a set of functions with the same attractive features for incompressible flows in _ cylindrical _ coordinates by using steps analogous to those for deriving vector _ spherical _ harmonics , but this procedure does not work .",
    "first , individual vector spherical harmonics do not satisfy no - slip boundary conditions at the wall of a spherical vessel .",
    "rather , when vector spherical harmonics are used in spectral simulations , radial boundary conditions are enforced by careful choice of the modal weights ( analogous to @xmath6 in eq .",
    "[ eq : superposition ] )  @xcite . in our mathematical investigations",
    "we find that analogous basis sets constructed in cylindrical coordinates suffer from the same trouble satisfying boundary conditions .",
    "a second problem arises in cylindrical coordinates as well .",
    "when we constructed basis sets in cylindrical coordinates using curls that enforce incompressibility , the requirements for modes to be mutually orthogonal were not easy to satisfy with any common functions .",
    "these two fundamental problems require that we construct a new basis in which we relax the exact constraint of incompressibility .",
    "we represent velocity fields in terms of separable scalar harmonics of the form @xmath25 where now we label each mode with three positive integer indices @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the bessel function of the first kind ( @xmath28 with @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 is the @xmath31 zero of @xmath27 .",
    "the azimuthal factor in the @xmath32 can be constructed using either a cosine or a sine , and we will use both modes when we reconstruct data . in eq .",
    "[ eq : psi ] , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath24 are wave numbers in the azimuthal , axial , and radial directions respectively .",

    "the radial factor @xmath36 is scaled such that the no - slip boundary condition is satisfied and there are @xmath37 oscillations over the range @xmath38 . here and below we will denote cosine and sine modes with the suffixes `` c '' and `` s '' , respectively . for example , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "a few of the scalar harmonics @xmath32 are shown in fig .",

    "we can use the scalar harmonics @xmath32 to approximate vector - valued functions @xmath46 in cylindrical coordinates by summing over @xmath26 in all three coordinate directions : @xmath47 where @xmath48 are unit vectors in the radial , azimuthal , and axial directions , respectively .",
    "we shall refer to each @xmath49 as a radial basis mode , each @xmath50 as an azimuthal basis mode , and each @xmath51 as an axial basis mode .",
    "together , the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 form a set which we shall call the `` vector cylindrical harmonics '' .",
    "the @xmath52 are dimensionless coefficients .",
    "such an approximation has many of the characteristics desired for constructing low - dimensional models of convection in a cylinder .",
    "the vector cylindrical harmonics are defined in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "each mode has magnitude zero at the boundaries @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , as is clear from eq .",
    "[ eq : psi ] .",
    "each mode therefore satisfies the required no - slip boundary condition , as do any superpositions of modes .",
    "each mode satisfies the periodicity boundary condition in the azimuthal direction : @xmath56 .",
    "each mode is also orthogonal to every other . by scalar products , @xmath57 where we have not written the indices @xmath26 because their values do not matter ; eq .",
    "[ eq : orthogonality ] is satisfied for pairs of modes of different coordinate direction regardless of their wave numbers . for pairs of modes of the same coordinate direction ,",
    "orthogonality is guaranteed by the facts that , if @xmath58 , @xmath59 again , eq .  [ eq : orthogonality ] is satisfied .    if the vector cylindrical harmonics formed a _",
    "complete _ basis set , then the approximation stated in eq .",
    "[ eq : superpositionvch ] is exact : as long as an infinite number of modes are included in the sum , any vector - valued function defined in the cylindrical domain considered here can be represented without error .",
    "still , even an incomplete basis can represent a large variety of flows of practical interest with good fidelity .",
    "the set of all cosines and sines , used in the azimuthal factor , is known to be complete .",
    "the set of all sines , used in the axial factor , is also known to be complete for no - slip boundaries .",
    "for the radial factor , we expect the bessel functions to be able to match functions of arbitrary spatial frequency because of the oscillatory nature of the @xmath60 .",
    "however , the envelope of their oscillation always decreases with radius @xmath35 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bessel ] , which is similar to fig 1a of @xcite .",
    "thus functions whose amplitude is minimum at small radius @xmath61 may not be well - matched with bessel functions . in general , construction and rigorous proof of a complete basis set is a challenge beyond the present scope .",
    "to test the applicability of vector cylindrical harmonics for representing data , we consider an example",
    ". j.  schumacher has graciously provided us with results of a numerical experiment in which he and colleagues solved the boussinesq equations for thermal convection in a cylinder of height @xmath62 and diameter @xmath63 .",

    "our goal is to continue reducing the dimensionality as long as the dominant flow features can be retained .",

    "the fidelity of the reproduction decreases monotonically with dimensionality . ]    we can go beyond qualitative examination of snapshots by quantifying the fidelity of reproduction .",

    "[ eq : superpositionvch ] that has a nonzero weight contains some spectral power , and if that mode is neglected when the sum is truncated , its spectral power is lost .",
    "in low - dimensional models for which many modes are necessarily neglected , the speed is underestimated more often than it is overestimated , such that the velocity ratio defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : velocityratio ] falls below unity , dropping to zero in the extreme case of all modes being eliminated .",
    "speed can occasionally be overestimated , however , because of aliasing onto modes with lower spatial frequency .",
    "a second measure of fidelity is the normalized error , @xmath107 the normalized error would be zero for a perfect model that matches the original data exactly . to identify a suitable minimal model that captures basic features of the dynamics , both the velocity ratio and the normalized error must be considered in light of the count of modes retained in the reproduction , @xmath108 which is necessarily less than the number of measurements : @xmath109 .",
    "figure  [ fig : snapstats ] shows the velocity ratio and normalized error for the six reproductions plotted in fig .  [ fig : projectsnaps ] .",
    "as the mode count @xmath110 ( or equivalently , the ratio @xmath111 ) decreases , the measured fidelity of the reproductions behaves as expected . with fewer modes , the velocity ratio is lower , and the normalized error is higher .",

    "the balance will vary depending on the application at hand , so by quantifying fidelity , modelers can make an informed decision .",
    "figure  [ fig : snapstats ] shows that both velocity ratio and normalized error are monotonic with mode count   but neither is linear .",
    "an astute choice of mode count will consider that fact .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : snapstats]a shows that the velocity ratio stays above 80% with just 675 modes , for which @xmath112 and the complexity of information retained has been reduced by more than two orders of magnitude .    .",

    "proving that the vector cylindrical harmonics comprise a complete basis set is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "completeness is not be necessary for the basis to be robust for practical application , however  @xcite .",
    "our original motivation for developing these general vector cylindrical harmonics was for the future application to characterizing convection and magnetoconvection in cylindrical liquid metal batteries , given measurements of the flow using ultrasound velocimetry .",
    "liquid metal batteries  @xcite are a new technology intended for storing large amounts of electrical energy , thereby allowing widespread incorporation of intermittent wind and solar power on the world s electrical grids .",
    "because the batteries are built with a liquid electrolyte and two liquid metal electrodes , fluid flow can affect battery performance  @xcite .",
    "flow is driven by thermal gradients , since liquid metals require high temperatures .",
    "flow is also driven by the electrical currents running through the batteries , whose magnitudes are on the order of 100  ma/@xmath125  @xcite .",
    "we hope that low - dimensional models will give battery designers and operators useful information about battery charge state , electrode uniformity , and battery health , all of which can be affected by flow .",
    "magnetic fields might also be expressed in terms of the vector cylindrical harmonics , though finding a set of weights to make the reproduction have divergence as near zero as possible would be important .",
    "practical questions will require attention in future work to construct low - dimensional modes using vector cylindrical harmonics .",
    "already we have raised the question of how many modes should be retained , and finding a definitive answer will depend on characteristics of the flow being measured as well as the uses intended for the model being constructed .",
    "there is also the question of _ which _ modes should be retained .",
    "above we have simply retained the modes with lowest wave number , but our measurements show that the lowest modes are not always the modes that capture the most information .",
    "retaining a non - consecutive set of modes would sometimes be useful .",
    "having chosen a set of modes , one should ask which _ measurements _ are most useful . solving the normal equations ( eq .  [ eq : normalvch ] ) , either directly or via singular value decomposition , involves inverting the characteristic matrix that appears on the left - hand side of the equations .",
    "if the matrix is singular , it can not be inverted , and galerkin projection fails .",
    "if the matrix is nearly singular , inversion produces substantial numerical error , and galerkin projection produces a poor representation of the measurements .",
    "the matrix can be characterized by its condition number , that is , the ratio of its largest eigenvalue to its smallest eigenvalue .",
    "condition numbers near unity signify a matrix which is far from singular , and therefore invertible with negligible error . the characteristic matrix in eq .",
    "[ eq : normalvch ] has elements calculated by evaluating all the basis modes at all the measurement locations . thus its condition number   and therefore the quality of the representation it produces   depends on both the choice of modes and the choice of measurement locations .",
    "we have seen in our own past work that optimizing the condition number is not trivial  @xcite .",
    "perhaps future work can find an optimization algorithm .",
    "finally , the vector cylindrical harmonics may be useful not only for producing models of simulation results , but for constructing spectral and/or pseudospectral simulations .",
    "in simple geometries like cylinders , spectral simulations are more accurate than simulations based on finite differences or finite elements , given the same computational resources .",
    "the vector spherical harmonics are used widely for simulating atmospheric flow  @xcite , flow in astrophysical objects  @xcite , and magnetic fields of stars  @xcite ( though , as mentioned above , radial boundary conditions are satisfied by appropriate choice of modal weights , not by the modes themselves ) .",
    "similarly , spectral simulations using the vector _ cylindrical _ harmonics could be applied to a wide variety of cylindrical systems , including rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite ) and flow in astrophysical disks @xcite ) .",
    "the authors acknowledge j.  schumacher for providing the example simulation results and h.  aluie for helpful conversations .",
