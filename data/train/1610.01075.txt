    "in a recent article @xcite , we have derived exact results for both the temperature @xmath0 and external ordering field @xmath1 behavior of the order parameter profile and the corresponding response functions  local and total susceptibilities  within the three - dimensional continuum mean - field ginzburg - landau ising type model of a simple fluid or binary liquid mixture for a system with a film geometry @xmath2 . in the current article",
    "we extend them to derive exact results for the thermodynamic casimir force within the same model .",
    "we concentrate in the region of the parametric space in @xmath3 plane close to the critical point of the fluid or close to the demixing point of the binary liquid mixture .",
    "we recall that for classical fluids in the case of a simple fluid or for binary liquid mixtures the wall generically prefers one of the fluid phases or one of the components . because of that in the current article we study the case when the bounding surfaces of the system strongly prefer one of the phases of the system . since in such systems",
    "one observes also the phenomena of the capillary condensation close below the critical point for small negative values of the ordering field @xmath4 , we also study the behavior of the force between the confining surfaces of the system in that parametric region . here",
    "@xmath5 , the field @xmath1 is measured in units of bohr magneton @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is some characteristic microscopic length , say , the average distance between the constituents of the fluid .",
    "let us recall that the model we are going to consider is a standard model within which one studies phenomena like critical adsorption @xcite , wetting or drying @xcite , surface phenomena @xcite , capillary condensation @xcite , localization - delocalization phase transition @xcite , finite - size behavior of thin films @xcite , the thermodynamic casimir effect @xcite , etc .",
    "the results of the model have been also used to calculate the casimir forces in systems with chemically or topographically patterned substrates , as well as , coupled with the derjaguin approximation , for studies on interactions of colloids  see , e.g. , the review @xcite and the literature cited therein . until very recently ,",
    "i.e. before ref .",
    "@xcite , the results for the case @xmath8 were derived analytically @xcite while the @xmath1-dependence was studied numerically either at the bulk critical point of the system @xmath9 , or along some specific isotherms  see , e.g. , @xcite . in the current article we are going to improve this situation with respect to the casimir force by deriving exact analytical results for it in the @xmath3 plane .    in 1948",
    "@xcite , after a discussion with niels bohr @xcite , the dutch physicist h. b. g. casimir realized that the zero - point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field in vacuum lead to a force of attraction between two perfectly conducting parallel plates and calculated this force . in 1978",
    "fisher and de gennes @xcite pointed out that a very similar effect exists in fluids with the fluctuating field being the field of its order parameter , in which the interactions in the system are mediated not by photons but by different type of massless excitations such as critical fluctuations or goldstone bosons ( spin waves ) .",
    "nowadays one usually terms the corresponding casimir effect the critical or the thermodynamic casimir effect @xcite .",
    "currently the casimir , and casimir - like , effects are object of studies in quantum electrodynamics , quantum chromodynamics , cosmology , condensed matter physics , biology and , some elements of it , in nano - technology .",
    "the interested reader can consult the existing impressive number of reviews on the subject @xcite .",
    "so far the critical casimir effect has enjoyed only two general reviews @xcite and few concerning specific aspects of it @xcite .",
    "the critical casimir effect has been already directly observed , utilizing light scattering measurements , in the interaction of a colloid spherical particle with a plate @xcite both of which are immersed in a critical binary liquid mixture . very recently",
    "the nonadditivity of critical casimir forces has been experimentally demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "indirectly , as a balancing force that determines the thickness of a wetting film in the vicinity of its bulk critical point the casimir force has been also studied in @xmath10he @xcite , @xcite , as well as in @xmath11he@xmath10he mixtures @xcite . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "measurements of the casimir force in thin wetting films of binary liquid mixture are also performed .",
    "the studies in the field have also enjoined a considerable theoretical attention .",
    "reviews on the corresponding results can be found in @xcite .    before turning exclusively to the behavior of the casimir force ,",
    "let us briefly remind some basic facts of the theory of critical phenomena . in the vicinity of the bulk",
    "critical point @xmath12 the bulk correlation length of the order parameter @xmath13 becomes large , and theoretically diverges : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the usual critical exponents and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the corresponding nonuniversal amplitudes of the correlation length along the @xmath21 and @xmath1 axes .",
    "if in a finite system @xmath13 becomes comparable to @xmath22 , the thermodynamic functions describing its behavior depend on the ratio @xmath23 and take scaling forms given by the finite - size scaling theory .",
    "for such a system the finite - size scaling theory @xcite predicts :    @xmath24 for the casimir force @xmath25    @xmath24 for the order parameter profile @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 . in eqs .",
    "( [ cas ] ) and ( [ mfss ] ) , @xmath29 is the critical exponent for the order parameter , @xmath30 is the dimension of the system , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are nonuniversal metric factors that can be fixed , for a given system , by taking them to be , e.g. , @xmath33^{1/\\nu}$ ] , and @xmath34^{\\delta/\\nu}$ ] .",
    "here , as in @xcite , we consider a critical system of ising type in a film geometry @xmath35 , where @xmath22 is supposed to be along @xmath36 axis , described by the minimizers of the standard @xmath37 ginzburg - landau functional @xmath38 = \\int_0^l { \\cal l}(\\phi,\\phi ' ) dz,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 here @xmath22 is the film thickness , @xmath40 is the order parameter assumed to depend on the perpendicular position @xmath41 only , @xmath42 is the bare reduced temperature , @xmath1 is the external ordering field , @xmath43 is the bare coupling constant and the primes indicate differentiation with respect to the variable @xmath36 .",
    "the thermodynamic casimir force is the excess pressure over the bulk one acting on the boundaries of the system which is due to the finite size of the system . to derive this excess pressure",
    "there are several ways but probably the most straightforward one is to apply the corresponding mathematical results of the variational calculus . for example , following gelfand and fomin @xcite it is easy to show that the functional derivative of @xmath44 with respect to the independent variable @xmath36 at @xmath45 is @xmath46 having in mind eq .",
    "( [ fdefising ] ) , one derives explicitly @xmath47 this derivative has the meaning of a force acting on the surface of the system at @xmath45 and , since @xmath44 is normalized per unit area , it has a meaning of a pressure acting on that surface .",
    "that is why , the notation @xmath48 is used .",
    "the above is actually the procedure used in @xcite where the authors perform the corresponding variational calculations on their own .",
    "another common way to proceed is to use the apparatus based on the stress tensor operator ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath49 it is elementary to check that the expression in the parentheses in the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "[ dz ] coincides with @xmath50 component of the stress tensor . in @xcite , we have shown that this expression is a first integral of the considered system , and therefore @xmath50 and @xmath48 do not depend on the coordinate @xmath36 at which they are calculated .    in the bulk system , within the mean - field theory",
    "the gradient term in @xmath51 is absent and instead of @xmath52 one obtains @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the order parameter of the bulk system .",
    "clearly , @xmath54 is determined by the cubic equation @xmath55+h=0 $ ] , @xmath54 being such that @xmath56 attains its minimum .",
    "now , one can immediately determine the casimir force as @xmath57 when @xmath58 the excess pressure will be inward of the system that corresponds to an _ attraction _ of the surfaces of the system towards each other and to a _ repulsion _ if @xmath59 .    in the light of the above it",
    "is evident that once the order parameter profile @xmath60 is known in analytic form for given values of the parameters @xmath61 and @xmath1 , then the corresponding casimir force is determined exactly .",
    "it is noteworthy that the above expressions do not depend on the specific choice of the boundary conditions . in the current article",
    "we specialize to the so - called @xmath62 boundary conditions under which one requires that @xmath63 .",
    "the exact solution for @xmath64 for this case has been determined in @xcite . in what follows we will study the properties of the force @xmath65 using this exact solution .    .",
    "we recall that at this point the susceptibility of the finite system diverges .",
    "the inset on the right shows the pre - capillary - condensation curve , determined in @xcite , where above @xmath66 and below @xmath67 the jump of the order parameter at the middle of the system is from a less dense gas to a more dense one . for @xmath68",
    "the system jumps from a ",
    "gas  to a  liquid  state . ]",
    "since the thermodynamic casimir force is normally presented in terms of the scaling variables @xmath69 @xmath70 in the remainder we are going to use such variables as the basic parameters determining the behavior of the force . in the above we have taken into account that for the model considered here @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the phase diagram of this model has been studied in details in @xcite  see there figure 3 and the text around it . here , for the convenience of the reader , it is depicted in figure [ fig : pd ] in terms of the scaling variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 .      in terms of the scaling variables given in equations ( [ isvarxt ] ) and ( [ isvarxh ] ) ,",

    "if there is more than one such solution @xmath99 , as explained in detail in @xcite , we take that one which leads to an order parameter profile that corresponds to the minimum of the energy functional ( [ fviafising ] ) @xmath100 where @xmath101 the precise mathematical procedure how this can be achieved , despite the divergence of the energy ( see eq .",

    "note that for relatively small negative values of @xmath74 , the jump in the force when one crosses the phase coexistence curve and the minimal casimir force actually occur at different values of the field @xmath87 .",
    "the last implies that by increasing the temperature one passes though the minimum of the force which then continuously increases till crossing the coexistence curve at which the force jumps to negative values much closer to @xmath110 . for @xmath111 the minimal value of the force",

    "it should be pointed out that the solutions @xmath90 of the transcendental equation ( [ treq ] ) that correspond to certain values of the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 are to be obtained numerically identifying by inspection those of them that obey the conditions formulated above .    the behavior of the normalized finite - size scaling function @xmath113 of the casimir force is shown in figures [ fig : dp ] and [ fig : cs ] .",
    "the relief map of the casimir force , as a function of both @xmath74 and @xmath87 , is shown in figure [ fig : dp ] where the upper part presents the force in a larger scale , while the lower one is a blow up of the region close to the bulk critical point .",
    "the only other model we are aware of where such a relief map as a function of both relevant scaling variables is available is that one of the three - dimensional spherical model under periodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "one observes a valley in this map with its deepest point at the dashed line shown in figure [ fig : phd_vs_mcf ] .",

    "figure [ casplusmf ] shows the behavior of @xmath114 as a function of @xmath74 for @xmath115 .",
    "note that @xmath114 is negative and for @xmath105 has a minimum at @xmath116 _ above _",
    "@xmath117 , as in the case of the @xmath118 ising model @xcite .",
    "the value of the minimum is @xmath119 times deeper than the corresponding value of the force at @xmath9 , which agrees with the results of @xcite .",
    "the overall behavior of the curves is similar to that one obtained for the @xmath120 ising model @xcite via density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations .",
    "let us , nevertheless , note that for bulk @xmath120 ising type systems there is no true phase transition for finite @xmath22 .",
    "it has been shown , however , that something similar does exist  a line of very weakly rounded first - order transitions ending in a pseudo - critical point @xcite .",
    "let us note that for @xmath121 , i.e. , @xmath122 , there is a special region of values of the field parameter when @xmath123 .",
    "for such values of @xmath87 one does not cross the capillary condensation line when lowering the temperature  see figure [ fig : pd ] .",
    "let us also note that , of course , one formally can consider temperatures well below @xmath112 but then the model will no longer deliver physically sensible information .",
    "we recall that in the current study when taking @xmath124 we do consider temperatures below but quite close to @xmath112 .",
    "figure [ fig : cf ] depicts the behavior of @xmath114 as a function of @xmath87 for @xmath125 .",
    "note that the minimum of the function @xmath126 is again negative , it is attained at @xmath127 , and is @xmath128 times deeper than the corresponding value at the bulk critical point .",
    "the markers on the curves , including the inset curve representing the blow - up in the case @xmath129 , show an excellent agreement of the numerical results obtained in @xcite ( filled markers ) , and in @xcite ( empty squares ) with the analytic results ( solid lines ) presented here .",
    "we observe that the casimir force exhibits a discontinuous jump on crossing the coexistence line as predicted in @xcite and as also shown in @xcite .",
    "it is easy to estimate the magnitude of this jump .",
    "one way of arguing is through direct formal use of the kelvin equation @xcite  as it is done in @xcite , which leads to the conclusion that the jump @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the bulk spontaneous order parameter , @xmath132 is the field on the capillary coexistence line and @xmath133 is the interfacial tension between the coexisting @xmath134 and @xmath135  phases of the fluid .",
    "here we have taken into account that according to the kelvin equation for a fixed @xmath124 and large @xmath22 coexistence happen at @xmath136 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the above expression for @xmath137 implies that the magnitude of the jump decreases in the same fashion as the interfacial tension , as @xmath0 increases at fixed @xmath22 towards @xmath112 .",
    "since the jumps is to an exponentially small force upon crossing the capillary condensation line the above estimate for the jump of the force can be also considered as an very rough estimation of the maximal value of the force for a given @xmath0 near the line of coexistence of the two phases .",
    "let us also note that for @xmath0 below but close to @xmath112 the above expressions for @xmath137 take a scaling form : @xmath138 and @xmath139 , as it is actually also clear from the scaling relation we have derived for that region of thermodynamic parameters .",
    "we recall that within the mean - field approach @xmath140 and , formally , @xmath141 in the scaling relations .",
    "we see that , as argued in @xcite , in a fluid confined by identical , strongly adsorbing walls the casimir force is strongly influenced by capillary condensation .",
    "the dmrg results presented there ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) and in @xcite for @xmath120 ising strip subject to identical surface fields also support this .",
    "let us note that for @xmath120 at @xmath9 the scaling function of the casimir force has a minimum about 100 times bigger than the casimir amplitude @xcite .",
    "we conclude that our results given in figures [ fig : dp ] , [ casplusmf ] and [ fig : cf ] are in full conformity with the statement made in @xcite that in a fluid confined by identical , strongly adsorbing walls the casimir force is much stronger for states which lie slightly off bulk coexistence , with @xmath142 .",
    "we have derived exact analytical results for the thermodynamic casimir force , see eq .",
    "( [ casimir_final ] ) , in a widely used model in the theory of phase transitions . in this model ,",
    "the value @xmath90 of the order parameter in the middle of the system is a solution of eq .",
    "( [ treq ] ) obeying the condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) .",
    "if there is more than one solution @xmath99 satisfying the above requirements , we take the one that leads to an order parameter profile corresponding to the minimum of the energy functional ( [ afunctional ] ) , as explained in details in @xcite .",
    "the obtained results allow us to plot the relief map of the force , see figure [ fig : dp ] , as a function of the both relevant scaling variables  the temperature and field .",
    "in addition , figures [ casplusmf ] and [ fig : cf ] present cross - sections of the behavior of the force for given fixed values of @xmath74 , or @xmath87 , as a function of @xmath87 , or @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : phd_vs_mcf ] presents the loci of the minima of the force in the @xmath108 plane .",
    "the inspection of the results convincingly demonstrates that for @xmath142 the casimir force in the capillary condensation regime is much more attractive than that found at the critical point .",
    "the comparison there of the numerical evaluation of our analytical expressions with the available numerical results reported in @xcite shows an excellent agreement between each other .",
    "furthermore , the analysis of the available dmrg numerical results @xcite for the behavior of the casimir force for the 2d ising model , as presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : num_results ] , led us to conclusion that our mean - field results , which formally correspond to systems with spacial dimension @xmath143 , are quite similar in the capillary condensation regime to those of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "thus , the results for the capillary condensation regime are quite robust with respect to the influence of the dimensionality .",
    "of course , the situation is different in the parametric space close to the bulk critical point , as well as very close to the critical point of the finite system .",
    "we recall that this later critical point shall show the singularities of the corresponding @xmath144-dimensional system . within the mean - field approach , as it is well known ,",
    "the role of the fluctuations is not properly taken into account . if one wants to go beyond the mean - field approximation for , say , @xmath145 dimensional systems one shall either relay on numerical methods like in @xcite , or use methods based on renormalization group approach",
    ". however , let us recall that the mean - field results serve as a starting point there for renormalization group calculations @xcite .",
    "thus , our results shall be helpful for such future analytical studies on the thermodynamic casimir force .",
    "finally , let us also remind that in physical chemistry and , more precisely , in colloid sciences fluid mediated interactions between two surfaces or large particles are usually referred to as solvation forces or disjoining pressure @xcite . thus , our results can be also considered as pertaining to a particular case of such forces when the fluid is near its critical point .",
