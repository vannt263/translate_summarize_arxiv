    "the fascination exerted by the kondo model  @xcite is probably due to the large variety of theoretical techniques invented to describe it . in fact",
    ", it has proven quite difficult to find a single approach that alone explains all features of the kondo model .",
    "this is particularly true in out - of - equilibrium situations  @xcite , for example when a bias voltage is applied to a source - drain setup .",
    "the seminal papers of nozires  @xcite on the fermi liquid ( fl ) theory have provided a remarkable insight into the low energy regime of the kondo model . based on a phenomenological picture ,",
    "this approach contains nevertheless all relevant physics and leads to predictions that are exact , albeit perturbative .",
    "the most famous example is certainly the wilson ratio , predicted by nozires  @xcite to be exactly two in agreement with numerical estimates by wilson  @xcite .",
    "finally , the fl picture provides a straightforward tool to study analytically the out - of - equilibrium regimes .",
    "the fl approach has been recast later in the more formal language of conformal field theory ( cft ) by affleck and ludwig  @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "the quasiparticles of the fl constitute a boundary free field theory  @xcite which is the infrared strong coupling fixed point of the kondo model . the low temperature regime",
    "is then dominated by the leading irrelevant operator at this fixed point and the results  @xcite are in complete agreement with nozires .",
    "more recently , elaborating on a more involved version of the bethe ansatz , lesage and saleur  @xcite were able to justify the fl theory for ordinary su(2 ) kondo and to extend it to all leading irrelevant operators . to be more exhaustive",
    ", we shall mention the work of yosida and yamada published independently from nozires . in a series of papers  @xcite on the parent anderson model",
    ", they did a thorough analysis of perturbation theory in the interaction term @xmath1 .",
    "they derived general low energy properties for the self - energy that proved the fermi liquid picture extending it to finite @xmath1 .",
    "the extension of their work to the second order low energy corrections is yet an unsolved problem . aside from these works and",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the fl theory as presented by nozires was not pursued much further  @xcite , probably because no simple means were known to relate the different phenomenological coefficients of the theory .",
    "following studies have started instead to focus on more exotic non - fermi liquid regimes  @xcite .",
    "originally discussed for an ordinary spin-@xmath2 impurity with su(2 ) symmetry , the fl fixed point constitutes more generally the low energy limit of the kondo model for a su(n ) hyperspin impurity . the value of @xmath0 tunes the relative importance of the different low energy processes .",
    "this su(n ) kondo model is called the coqblin - schrieffer model  @xcite for a single - electron impurity .",
    "both this model and its parent anderson model have exact bethe ansatz solutions  @xcite .",
    "the su(4 ) case has a particular experimental relevance with recent achievements in vertical quantum dots  @xcite and carbon nanotubes  @xcite . in those experiments ,",
    "an orbital degeneracy might combine with the usual spin-@xmath2 to form an intricate su(4 ) symmetry .",
    "the conventional fermi liquid description contains only the leading irrelevant operators of dimension @xmath3 , also linear in @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the kondo temperature .",
    "these operators include a combination of an elastic channel with an inelastic one .",
    "the ratio of elastic to inelastic scattering amplitudes is fixed by the friedel sum rule  @xcite or more generally by the principle of _ floating _ of the kondo resonance that we shall detail in the core of this article .",
    "this fixed ratio can also be shown to be a consequence of the vanishing charge susceptibility on the dot  @xcite .",
    "the conventional fl approach , as we described , is sufficient to compute observables that have a linear energy ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) dependence , hence the success in the determination of wilson s ratio even for a general su(n ) symmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , for observables with a quadratic behavior such as the resistivity or the conductance , the addition of dimension-@xmath9 operators becomes necessary .",
    "the ordinary su(2 ) kondo effect is peculiar in this respect since the coefficients of these new dimension-@xmath9 operators identically vanish .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the conventional fl approach by introducing the full set of dimension-@xmath9 operators with their coefficients . within the theoretical framework proposed by nozires",
    ", this second generation adds three terms to the conduction electron phase shift .",
    "one represents elastic scattering and two inelastic scattering involving the excitation of one and two electron - hole pairs .",
    "the ratios between the coefficients of the three fl corrections are then fixed by using the _ floating _ of the kondo resonance .",
    "let us emphasize that the picture built in this article for the kondo resonance _",
    "floating _ extends the initial vision of nozires .",
    "not only the peak of the resonance is tied to the fermi singularity but also the _ whole structure _ of the resonance .",
    "we also investigate how this translates into the cft language .",
    "a single dimension-@xmath9 operator is identified with su(n ) invariance .",
    "its expansion on the electron fields recovers the aforementioned three processes with the same coefficient ratios .",
    "last step of the analysis , the free energy as a function of generalized magnetic fields can be easily calculated within the fl theory including all dimension-@xmath3 and dimension-@xmath9 operator sets .",
    "comparing the result with the exact solution obtained from an alternative bethe ansatz  @xcite , the ratio between dimension-@xmath3 and dimension-@xmath9 corrections can be determined .",
    "all coefficients are finally related to each other so that , as expected , universality is recovered as @xmath5 remains the only energy scale in the problem .",
    "this completes our full characterization of the low energy fl theory for the kondo su(n ) model .",
    "we stress again that this work does not modify ( and therefore does not contradict ) the ordinary su(2 ) analysis  @xcite since the new fl corrections are vanishing in that case .",
    "however these new corrections are fundamental in the more general su(n ) case where particle - hole symmetry is broken .",
    "the idea of introducing the next - to - leading order fl corrections was first formulated in ref .",
    "@xcite , although incompletely .",
    "it was however not taken into account in ref .",
    "the current and the noise through a su(n ) kondo quantum dot were calculated in refs .",
    "@xcite , with a correction in  @xcite on the basis of this work .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows : the new fl corrections are introduced in the usual fl framework in sec .",

    "@xmath14 is the annihilation operator for a conduction electron with spin @xmath15 and wavevector @xmath16 ( measured from @xmath17 ) .",
    "the kondo interaction , controlled by @xmath18 , is an antiferromagnetic coupling between the impurity spin operator @xmath19 and the spin operator of the conduction electrons at @xmath20 ( impurity site ) . @xmath21 and @xmath22 are two sets of @xmath23 generators satisfying the commutation relations @xmath24 = i f_{abc } s^c , \\quad [ t^a , t^b ] = i f_{abc }",

    "physically , the kondo hamiltonian   emerges from an anderson model with exactly @xmath27 electrons at the impurity site .    in the ground state of the model ,",
    "the spin of the impurity forms a singlet with conduction electrons .",
    "it is therefore completely screened and disappears from the picture at low energy .",
    "the fermi liquid theory describes the low energy regime and is built on the following assumptions : ( i ) the singlet scatters elastically conduction electrons , ( ii ) virtual polarization of the singlet leads to weak interactions between conduction electrons of different spin and , ( iii ) the energy of the system is an analytical function only of the bare energies @xmath28 and of the relative quasiparticle occupation numbers @xmath29 . more precisely , @xmath30 is the actual occupation number relative to the ground state distribution with fermi energy @xmath13 . the last point ( iii )",
    "is in fact the most stringent one and it is reminiscent of the usual ( bulk ) fermi liquid theory .",
    "instead of considering the total energy , one can concentrate on the energy shift of a single quasiparticle excitation and , by imposing boundary condition for a system of finite size , translate it into an electron phase shift at energy @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath46 is similar to the first three ( elastic ) terms , which identifies @xmath5 as the size of the kondo resonance .",

    "the dependence of the phase shift   on the conduction electron populations is also physically sensible .",
    "the kondo screening is a many - body effect that results from the sharpness of the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "the resonance is therefore extremely sensitive to changes in the occupation numbers which modify the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "the _ floating _ of the kondo resonance follows from the same physical idea .",
    "since the kondo resonance is built by the conduction electrons themselves , its structure should be invariant when doping the system such that the shapes of electronic distributions remain the same , apart from a global energy shift @xmath47 .",

    "the identities   are consistent with the friedel sum rule but they can not be simply reduced to it . it is the whole kondo resonance structure that remains invariant through the energy shift and not only the phase shift at the fermi energy . to our knowledge , this generalization of the original nozires argument had not yet been pointed out .",

    "the conductance   is readily obtained from the electron lifetime   with the result @xmath147 \\\\[1 mm ] & =   1 + \\left ( \\frac{\\pi t}{t_k } \\right)^2   \\left [   1 - \\frac{8}{3 n }   + { \\cal o }   \\left(\\frac{1}{n^2 } \\right )    \\right ]    , \\end{split}\\ ] ] in full agreement with ref .",
    "this agreement confirms that the two procedures , namely the fl theory expanded at large @xmath0 on one side , and the large @xmath0 approach expanded at low energy on the other side , indeed correspond to the same physical limit .",
    "nevertheless it does not help us to validate the new dimension-@xmath9 fl corrections since @xmath148 disappears from the final result  .",

    "one conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that our extension of the fl theory satisfies a stringent test imposed by the large @xmath0 approach",
    ". we can also be confident in our theory and reverse the perspective with the following conclusion : we have checked on representative observables that the @xmath10 expansion of read and newns is correct at low energy .",
    "in the case of a generalized su(n ) symmetry for the impurity away from half - filling , the kondo resonance is centered off the fermi energy .",
    "one consequence is that observables like the resistivity in magnetic alloys , or the current and the noise in quantum dots , require at low energy the introduction of the next - to - leading order correction around the fermi liquid fixed point .",
    "two possible reasonings have been employed in this work to identify the new fermi liquid corrections . in a first approach",
    ", the landau expansion of the phase shift has been pushed to the next order .",
    "the coefficients of the three resulting new contributions have further been related by using the _ floating _ argument .",
    "physically , the _ floating _ expresses the fact that the kondo resonance is built only by the distribution of conduction electron and follows its fermi singularity .    in a second approach ,",
    "we have proposed a single operator , cubic in the spin currents , and which remains invariant over su(n ) rotations .",
    "this operator resembles the cubic casimir invariant of the su(n ) lie algebra . performing point splitting , we have recovered the same three processes with the same relation between their coupling constants .",
    "in fact , the reduction of coupling constants can be assigned to a common physical origin : the quenching of charge excitation on the impurity . in the first approach ,",
    "the only fixed _",
    "absolute _ energy reference that the kondo resonance might depend on , is the single - particle energy level .",
    "it is effectively pushed to infinity in the kondo limit which allows to develop the _ floating _ argument . in the second approach , the fact that charge excitations are frozen imposes that our cubic operator involves only spin currents .    next the ratio between the leading and",
    "the next - to - leading order corrections has been determined by comparison with the exact solution for the free energy .",
    "this reduces further the number of coupling constants to a single one which is essentially the inverse of the kondo temperature .",
    "finally , the large @xmath0 regime of our theory has been shown to coincide exactly with field theoretical large @xmath0 predictions , thereby comforting our analysis .",
    "let us conclude by noting some consequences for experiments ( experiments in alloys with magnetic impurities are reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite with a comparison to exact bethe ansatz results ) .",
    "the subtleties of this work do not apply to the ordinary spin-@xmath2 kondo effect with su(2 ) symmetry since our novel corrections all vanish in that case ( and for a half - filled dot in general ) .",
    "however , for experiments probing a possible su(4 ) kondo effect , the ingredients presented here are necessary to determine the low energy properties of the model .      79 natexlab#1#1bibnamefont#1#1bibfnamefont#1#1citenamefont#1#1url#1`#1`urlprefix[2]#2 [ 2][]#2 , _ _ ( ) . , * * ( ) ; and , * * ( ) ; , * * ( ) ; , * * ( ) ; , * * ( ) ; , * * ( ) . , * * ( ) . , in _ _ edited by ( ) ; , * * ( ) . , * * ( ) .",
