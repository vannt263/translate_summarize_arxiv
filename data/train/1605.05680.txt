    "the production of @xmath2 mesons at forward rapidity in high energy proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions can provide valuable information on gluon saturation . indeed , the production of particles at forward rapidity probes the target at very small @xmath1 , where saturation effects should be enhanced .",
    "in particular , the charm quark mass being of the same order of magnitude as the saturation scale , @xmath2 production should be sensitive to these dynamics .",
    "the charm quark mass is also large enough to provide a hard scale , making a perturbative study of this process possible . in addition",
    ", @xmath2 production has been the subject of many experimental studies at the lhc , both in proton - proton  @xcite and in proton - nucleus  @xcite collisions .",
    "this provides a lot of data to confront with nuclear effects predicted by various theoretical models , both in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework @xcite and as constraints for nuclear parton distribution functions @xcite and energy loss in cold nuclear matter  @xcite .    in a recent work  @xcite we studied , in the cgc framework , the production of forward @xmath2 mesons in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions at the lhc .",
    "we showed that , when using the glauber approach to generalize the dipole cross section to nuclei , the nuclear suppression for minimum bias events is smaller than in previous cgc calculations such as  @xcite , and much closer to experimental data . in this paper",
    "we will study , in the same framework , other observables of interest in this process , such as @xmath2 production at backward rapidity , the centrality dependence in the optical glauber model and the mean transverse momentum of the produced @xmath0 s .",
    "let us briefly recall the main steps of the calculation .",
    "for more details we refer the reader to ref .",
    "we use the color evaporation model ( cem ) to relate the cross section for @xmath2 production to the @xmath3 pair production cross section . in this model a fixed fraction @xmath4 of the @xmath3 pairs produced below the @xmath5-meson threshold are assumed to hadronize into @xmath2 mesons : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the transverse momentum , the rapidity and the invariant mass of the @xmath3 pair respectively , @xmath10 gev is the d meson mass and @xmath11 is the charm quark mass that we will vary between 1.2 and 1.5 gev .",
    "note that in this work we will focus on ratios where @xmath4 cancels so we do not need to fix it to any specific value here .",
    "the study of gluon and quark pair production in the dilute - dense limit of the cgc formalism was started some time ago  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and used in several calculations such as  @xcite .",
    "the physical picture is the following : an incoming gluon from the projectile can split into a quark - antiquark pair either before or after the interaction with the target .",
    "the partons propagating trough the target are assumed to interact eikonally with it , picking up a wilson line factor in either the adjoint ( for gluons ) or the fundamental ( for quarks ) representation .",
    "since we study @xmath2 production at forward rapidity , where the projectile is probed at large @xmath1 , we will use the collinear approximation in which the incoming gluon is assumed to have zero transverse momentum . in this approach",
    "the cross section for @xmath12 production reads , in the large-@xmath13 limit  @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the transverse momenta of the quarks , @xmath17 and @xmath18 their rapidities , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the dimension of the adjoint representation of su(@xmath13 ) .",

    "the dipole correlator @xmath34 is obtained by solving numerically the running coupling balitsky - kovchegov ( rcbk ) equation  @xcite .",

    "the running coupling is taken as : @xmath41 where @xmath42 parametrizes the uncertainty related to the scale of the strong coupling in the transverse coordinate space .",
    "the free parameters in these expressions are obtained by fitting the combined inclusive hera dis cross section data  @xcite for @xmath43 gev@xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "their best fit values ( with @xmath46 ) are @xmath47 gev@xmath44 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 mb . in the case of a proton target",

    "the fit only includes light quarks . in particular",
    "this leaves the charm quark mass that would be consistent with the dis data in this model still uncertain , which is why we vary it in a rather large range for the uncertainty estimate in this work .",
    "to generalize this proton dipole correlator to the case of a nuclear target we use , as in  @xcite , the optical glauber model . in this model the gluons at the initial rapidity @xmath53 are localized in the individual nucleons of the nucleus .",
    "the nucleons are then taken to be distributed randomly and independently in the transverse plane according to the standard woods - saxon nuclear density profile .",

    "all the other parameters in the initial condition ( [ eq : ica ] ) , which is evolved using the rcbk equation for each @xmath33 , are the same as in the proton case .    in this model",
    "the dipole amplitude depends on the impact parameter and we need to integrate explicitly over it .",
    "the impact parameter dependence , which carries over to the centrality dependence , thus appears naturally in this model .",
    "our practical procedure for carrying out this comparison will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : centrality ] .",
    "in our previous work  @xcite we only considered @xmath2 production in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions at forward rapidity . in these kinematics",
    "the process can be seen as the collision of a dilute proton probed at large @xmath1 , which can be described using well known parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , and a dense target described in terms of classical color fields .",
    "the nuclear modification of @xmath2 production was also measured at backward rapidity by alice  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite . in this case",
    "the produced @xmath2 is moving in the direction of the incoming nucleus and the physical picture is the same as at forward rapidity , but with the roles of the projectile and the target interchanged , i.e. a dilute proton or nucleus interacts with a dense proton target .",
    "the latter is described in the same way as in proton - proton collisions at forward rapidity , while the projectile is described either by a pdf in the case of a proton or by a nuclear pdf ( npdf ) in the case of a nucleus .",
    "therefore the calculation is very similar to the case of proton - proton collisions in our previous study .",
    "note , however , that in general nuclear pdfs are less tightly constrained by experimental data than usual proton pdfs . in the following we will use the leading order eps09 npdf parametrization  @xcite which provides additional error sets to estimate this uncertainty .",
    "the lo eps09 analysis uses the cteq6l1  @xcite proton pdfs as a reference , therefore for consistency we use same parametrization of proton pdfs when computing the nuclear modification factor at backward rapidity . nevertheless ,",
    "while it could be sizeable for the cross section , the difference compared to the mstw 2008 parametrization is very small for the nuclear modification factor .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rpa_backward ] we show the nuclear modification factor @xmath60 , defined as @xmath61 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath62 obtained in this way at negative rapidity compared with data from alice  @xcite and lhcb  @xcite experiments .",
    "the uncertainty in our calculation is significantly larger than at forward rapidity  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that we include in our uncertainty band , in addition to the variation of the charm quark mass and of the factorization scale , the nuclear pdf uncertainty obtained following the procedure described in ref .",
    "in particular , our lower bound for the factorization scale is @xmath63 which can reach values of less than 2 gev at small transverse momentum . the nuclear pdfs",
    "are not well constrained at such small scales at the moment .",
    "nevertheless the general agreement with data is quite good taking into account the rather large theoretical and experimental uncertainties . in this case deviations of @xmath64 from unity",
    "are entirely due to the nuclear pdfs .",
    "now that we have computed the nuclear modification factor both at forward  @xcite and backward rapidities , we have access to the forward to backward ratio @xmath65 , defined as @xmath66 this ratio can be interesting to study because there may be an additional cancellation of some uncertainties common to the numerator and the denominator . in particular , when determining the nuclear modification factor , experimental studies such as  @xcite have to use an interpolation for the reference proton - proton cross section since there is no data at @xmath67 tev .",
    "this interpolation is not needed to study @xmath65 , but the final statistical uncertainty may be larger if the coverage in rapidity by the detector is not symmetric with respect to 0 . concerning our calculation ,",
    "we have seen that at negative rapidity the uncertainty on @xmath60 due to nuclear pdfs is rather large .",
    "this error will remain in @xmath65 since the computation of @xmath60 at positive rapidity does not involve npdfs .",
    "indeed , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : rfb ] , where we show the forward to backward ratio as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath62 , that the uncertainty on this quantity is still quite large . nevertheless , within this error band",
    "the agreement with data is reasonable , although the variation at low @xmath62 seems to be steeper than in the data . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rfb ] ( r ) we only show our results for @xmath65 as a function of @xmath62 integrated over the same @xmath8 range as alice data  @xcite , which is slightly smaller than for lhcb data  @xcite , but our results for @xmath68 would be very similar and alice and lhcb data are compatible with each other .",
    ".average number of binary collisions in each centrality class as obtained in the optical glauber model compared with the value estimated by alice  @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath69 in the last column are solved from the relation @xmath70 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have seen that the optical glauber model contains an explicit impact parameter dependence which can be related to centrality determinations at experiments . in this section",
    "we will compare this centrality dependence with its recent measurement at the lhc by the alice collaboration in the range @xmath71  @xcite .      we still need to relate the explicit impact parameter dependence in our model to the definition of centrality used by experiments .",
    "the experimental data are usually presented in terms of centrality classes . in the optical glauber model",
    "these classes would be defined by calculating the impact parameter range corresponding to the centrality class @xmath72 using the relation @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the total inelastic proton - nucleus cross section , given by @xmath75 and the scattering probability at impact parameter @xmath33 is @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section . the particle yield in each centrality class is then given by @xmath78 where the values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 are obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : centrality ] ) and @xmath81 corresponds to the expression of the cross section before integrating over @xmath33 .    in practice , however , this straightforward procedure can not be used for comparing our calculation with the experimental centrality classes .",
    "this can be seen most clearly by calculating the average number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions for each centrality class . in the optical glauber model",
    "this is computed using the relation @xmath82 with @xmath83 table  [ tab : ncoll ] shows @xmath84 for the optical glauber centrality classes compared to the values given by alice  @xcite for the experimental ones . for central collisions the average number of binary collisions estimated by alice is smaller than in the optical glauber model , while the opposite is true for peripheral collisions .    the impact parameter is not directly observable , so the experimental centrality selection has to use some other observable as a proxy for it . in the case of the alice analysis  @xcite",
    "the observable used is the energy of the lead - going side zero - degree calorimeter ( zdc ) . due to the large fluctuations in the signal for a fixed impact parameter , the values of @xmath85 vary less strongly with centrality in the experimental classes than in the optical glauber ones . thus ,",
    "for example , a relatively peripheral smaller-@xmath85 event can end up in the most central class in the case of a fluctuation in the zdc signal .      developing a detailed monte carlo glauber model that would enable us to exactly match the experimental centrality classes would be beyond the scope of this work .",
    "therefore we start from the assumption that the alice glauber model is correct and produces a reliable estimate for the @xmath86 in each experimental class .",
    "we then assume that the mapping between this @xmath86 and the impact parameter is accurately enough described by our optical glauber model , and use the relation @xmath87 to determine a mean impact parameter corresponding to the experimental centrality class .",
    "the values of @xmath69 resulting from this procedure are shown in table  [ tab : ncoll ] .",
    "we then calculate the nuclear modification factor for the centrality class using this fixed value of @xmath69 .",
    "we note that following this procedure for the 80 - 100% centrality class would lead to a value of @xmath69 for which our calculation would not be applicable because the saturation scale of the nucleus falls below the one of the proton . therefore in the following",
    "we will only show results for the five most central classes considered by alice .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpa_bins ] we show a comparison of our calculation with alice data for the nuclear modification factor in different centrality classes , @xmath88 , defined as @xmath89 as a function of @xmath62 .",
    "we observe that the description of experimental data is generally satisfactory in the first four bins .",
    "for the fifth bin the value of @xmath90 obtained in the optical glauber model is almost constant and very close to one , while the data still shows a significant variation with @xmath62 .",
    "the discrepancy with experimental data for peripheral collisions comes from the fact that in our model the saturation scale of the lead nucleus falls below the one of the proton for a value of @xmath69 of the order of 6.3 fm , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qs2_ncoll ]  ( l ) . we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : qs2_ncoll ]  ( r ) , where we show the number of binary collisions as a function of @xmath69 , that this corresponds to @xmath91 .",
    "this is the point where , by definition , @xmath88 reaches 1 in our calculation and beyond which the validity of the framework we have used is questionable . on the other hand ,",
    "alice data shows that @xmath88 is still significantly smaller than 1 down to @xmath92 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qpa_ncoll ] ) .",
    "the strong centrality dependence is caused by the value of @xmath52 extracted from dis fits being much smaller than the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section .",
    "the hera data , both the inclusive cross section fitted in ref .",
    "@xcite and data on exclusive vector meson production ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , lead to a picture where the small-@xmath1 gluons that can participate in a hard process in a proton are concentrated in a rather small area in the transverse plane ( see also the discussion in ref .",
    "this small-@xmath1 gluon `` hot spot '' is then surrounded by a larger `` cloud '' that only participates in soft interactions , contibuting to the total nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section .",
    "our model takes this picture to the extreme , by assuming that at the initial rapidity @xmath93 the gluons contributing to @xmath0 production are concetrated in the area @xmath94 inside the target nucleons .",
    "thus , for peripheral collisions , the probe proton can overlap with the soft cloud of @xmath95 target nucleons while still seeing on average only one small-@xmath1 gluon hot spot in the target , thus leaving a hard process like @xmath0 production approximately unmodified .",
    "this centrality dependence could probably be mildened by using a larger value for @xmath52 of the order of @xmath77 ( as is effectively done in @xcite ) .",
    "this would , however , lose the consistency of our description of the nucleon from hera to the lhc .",
    "also , as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , varying these parameters in an uncontrolled way could very easily , depending on how exactly it is done , lead to an excessive suppression for minimum bias collisions , or to an @xmath60 that is very far from unity even at high transverse momentum .    note that the saturation scale ( or gluon density ) at the edge of the nucleus being smaller than that of the proton is an artefact of averaging over the transverse locations of the dense but small gluon hot spots of the nucleons in the target nucleus .",
    "therefore we do not use the optical glauber parametrization in this region , but explicitly set @xmath60 to unity .",
    "nevertheless , even an explicit monte carlo glauber procedure with the same parameters would not change the ordering @xmath96 that leads to the absence of nuclear effects for peripheral collisions with @xmath97 .     at a function of @xmath62 at @xmath98 tev in the 60 - 80% centrality class , both when using a fixed impact parameter and when integrating explicitly over @xmath69 using the @xmath85 distribution obtained in two different models .",

    "the results we have shown in the previous section were obtained with a fixed impact parameter chosen so that the number of binary collisions in the optical glauber model is equal to the average number of binary collisions estimated by alice in each centrality class .",
    "however , the nuclear modification ratio in a given centrality bin receives contributions from a distribution of different impact parameters .",
    "one could therefore argue that having a profile in the impact parameter space and integrating over @xmath69 could lead to different results . to quantify this effect we will here use two different kinds of @xmath85 distributions to obtain distributions in the impact parameter space .",
    "the first one is provided by alice  @xcite and is obtained from the slow nucleon model ( snm )  @xcite . since in this model the average number of binary collisions is not the same as the one obtained in the hybrid method used in ref .",
    "@xcite , we shift the distributions so that @xmath86 matches the one in the third column of table  [ tab : ncoll ] . it should be noted that , contrary to the hybrid method , this method is biased  @xcite .",
    "in addition , this is only one possible way of extracting @xmath85 distributions at experiments .",
    "other methods could yield significantly different distributions . to try to quantify the dependence of our results on the particular shape of the @xmath85 distributions",
    ", we will also use , for the 60 - 80% centrality bin which is the most sensitive to fluctuations , a simple linearly decreasing distribution .",
    "the two parameters of this distribution , its height at the origin ( @xmath99 ) and the @xmath85 value at which it vanishes ( @xmath100 ) , are determined by imposing that it is normalized to unity and that @xmath101 : @xmath102 , @xmath103 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpa_dist_ncoll ] we show the values obtained for the nuclear modification factor as a function of @xmath62 in the 60 - 80% centrality bin , both when using a fixed impact parameter and when integrating explicitly over @xmath69 using the two @xmath85 distributions described previously ( snm and linear ) .",
    "the explicit integration over @xmath69 leads to a smaller @xmath90 at small transverse momentum .",
    "the effect is more pronounced with the linear distribution .",
    "similar results are obtained when looking at @xmath90 integrated over @xmath62 as a function of @xmath85 , as show in fig .",
    "[ fig : qpa_ncoll ] .",
    "in particular , we see that the value of @xmath90 in the 60 - 80% centrality bin obtained with the linear @xmath85 distribution is significantly closer to the alice data point . on the other hand ,",
    "the value obtained with the snm distribution is very close to the fixed impact parameter result .    in conclusion , it is not possible for now to directly compare our impact parameter dependent results with the centrality dependent measurement performed by alice . indeed , for this one would need to have access to an unbiased determination of the @xmath85 distributions in each centrality bin , which does not exist at the moment .",
    "here we have tried to estimate the importance of this effect by using @xmath85 distributions obtained in two models .",
    "the fact that these two models lead to significantly different results for peripheral collisions while the central bins are much less sensitive to fluctuations means that the variation of @xmath90 as a function of centrality is too model dependent to have a reliable comparison with experimental data .",
    "in ref .  @xcite we found that the uncertainty on cross sections both in proton - proton and proton - nucleus collisions was rather large .",
    "this uncertainty mostly affects the normalization and therefore quantities such as the nuclear modification factor show a smaller uncertainty . besides the nuclear modification factor , another observable which is not sensitive to the absolute normalization of the cross section is the mean transverse momentum of the produced @xmath2 meson . in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanpt ]  ( l ) we show this quantity as a function of the rapidity in proton - proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 7 tev and compare with lhcb data  @xcite .",
    "we observe that our calculation is compatible with the data but it is still affected by a relatively large uncertainty . in the collinear approximation on the proton side that we are using here , the mean transverse momentum increases slightly with rapidity , a trend not seen in the data .",
    "one must , however , keep in mind that towards central rapidities the intrinsic transverse momentum from also the proton should increase , leading to the opposite behavior .",
    "a matching between the collinear and @xmath104-factorized approximations required to fully quantify this effect is beyond the scope of this paper . in fig .",
    "[ fig : meanpt ]  ( r ) we show the same quantity in proton - lead collisions at a center of mass energy @xmath98 tev .",

    "[ fig : pt2_ncoll ]  ( l ) we see that our calculation agrees with this measurement within the rather large uncertainty band ( except for most peripheral collisions , where our calculation is not applicable as explained previously ) . when one considers the difference between @xmath106 in proton - lead and in proton - proton collisions , as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : pt2_ncoll ]  ( r ) , the uncertainty on our calculation shrinks and shows a too strong variation as a function of @xmath85 , both when using a fixed impact parameter and when integrating explicitly over @xmath69 using the @xmath85 distributions obtained in the slow nucleon model .",
    "however , as in section  [ sec : b_dist ] , the results obtained when integrating over @xmath69 depend strongly on the exact shape of the @xmath85 distributions used . in particular , one can see that using a linear @xmath85 distribution leads to a better agreement with data for peripheral collisions .",
    "in this work we use the simple color evaporation model to describe the hadronization of @xmath3 pairs into @xmath2 mesons .",
    "the normalization of cross sections then depends on a non perturbative constant @xmath4 , see ( [ eq : dsigmajpsi ] ) . the uncertainty associated with this parameter can be eliminated by studying the ratio of cross sections at different center of mass energies .",
    "in addition , from the experimental point of view , systematic uncertainties can cancel to some extent in this ratio .",
    "such a measurement has been made possible at the lhc for proton - proton collisions thanks to the recent increase of @xmath107 from 8 to 13 tev .",

    "[ fig : ratio_13tev_8tev ] we compare these data with the results that we obtain for this ratio in our model .",
    "the resulting uncertainty is rather small and the agreement with data is quite good , in particular at large rapidity and relatively low transverse momentum which is the kinematical domain where our calculation is expected to be the most reliable .",
    "thanks to its recent upgrade , the lhc may also perform proton - lead collisions at a higher center of mass energy in the future . here",
    "we study how our results would be affected by a change of @xmath109 from 5 to 8 tev . in fig .",

    "8 and 10 of ref .",
    "@xcite because we corrected a numerical problem which was causing the region of large impact parameters ( where the saturation scale of the lead nucleus falls below the one of the proton , see fig .",
    "[ fig : qs2_ncoll ]  ( l ) ) to be neglected .",
    "here we impose @xmath110 in this region , as in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as one could expect , the higher center of mass energy leads to a stronger suppression due to the higher densities reached in the target .",
    "however , the effect is quite small , in particular compared to the size of the uncertainties . for this reason",
    "we only show , for @xmath111 tev , our results for the `` central '' values of the parameters ( @xmath112 gev and @xmath113 ) . for @xmath98 tev",
    "we show both the central value and the uncertainty band corresponding to the variation of @xmath11 and @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , while measuring forward @xmath2 production in 8 tev proton - lead collisions could help reduce experimental uncertainties by getting rid of the interpolation needed for the proton - proton reference , we do not expect significantly stronger nuclear effects at this energy .",
    "this is not surprising since we use the same dipole cross sections as in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a weak energy dependence of the nuclear modification factor was found in single inclusive particle production .",
    "in this paper we have extended our study of forward @xmath2 production in proton - nucleus collisions in the color glass condensate framework to new kinematics and observables .",
    "in particular we have studied the nuclear suppression at negative rapidities by describing the nucleus probed at large @xmath1 in terms of nuclear parton distribution functions .",
    "we achieved a quite good description of experimental measurements of this quantity , even if the uncertainty is larger at backward than at forward rapidities because the nuclear pdfs are not yet very strongly constrained by data .",
    "this allowed us to compute the forward to backward ratio , again with a good agreement with data within the rather large uncertainties .",
    "we have also studied the centrality dependence of our calculation .",
    "while using the optical glauber model to extend the description from a proton target to a nucleus leads to a better agreement with experimental data for minimum bias observables than previous calculations in the same framework , it is difficult to compare directly the resulting centrality dependence to experimental data . indeed , using a fixed impact parameter obtained in the optical glauber model from the average number of binary collisions estimated by alice leads to a too strong centrality dependence . on the other hand , to integrate explicitly over the impact parameter one has to use @xmath85 distributions based on various assumptions and our calculation is very sensitive to the exact shape of these distributions . finally we have studied how the nuclear modification factor would be affected by an increase of the center of mass energy achievable at the lhc .",

    "<S> forward rapidity @xmath0 meson production in proton - nucleus collisions can be an important constraint of descriptions of the small-@xmath1 nuclear wavefunction . in an earlier work we studied this process using a dipole cross section satisfying the balitsky - kovchegov equation , fit to hera inclusive data and consistently extrapolated to the nuclear case using a standard woods - saxon distribution . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present further calculations of these cross sections , studying the mean transverse momentum of the meson and the dependence on collision centrality . </S>",
    "<S> we also extend the calculation to backward rapidities using nuclear parton distribution functions . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the parametrization is overall rather consistent with the available experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a tendency towards a too strong centrality dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this can be traced back to the rather small transverse area occupied by small-@xmath1 gluons in the nucleon that is seen in the hera data , compared to the total inelastic nucleon - nucleon cross section . </S>"
