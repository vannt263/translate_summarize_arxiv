    "the detection of the large - angle anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background by the _ cobe _",
    "dmr ( @xcite ) is an important evidence for the large - scale space - time inhomogenities .",
    "since then , several small - scale anisotropy measurements have hinted that the doppler peak resulted from acoustic oscillations of the baryon - photon plasma on the last scattering surface seems to be present .",
    "it is believed that measuring cmb anisotropies on all angular scales can give invaluable information of the early universe , such as testing inflation , pinning down cosmological parameters , and differentiating scalar from tensor perturbations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "complementary to the anisotropy , polarization is another important property of the cmb .",
    "the degree of cmb polarization has been extensively calculated ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in a universe with standard recombination ,",
    "the polarization is about @xmath0 of the anisotropy on small angular scales while the large - scale polarization is insignificant .",
    "if early matter reionization of the universe occurs , the large - scale polarization would be greatly enhanced to a @xmath0 level with the large - scale anisotropy reasonably unaffected .",
    "meanwhile , the small - scale anisotropy would be significantly suppressed .",
    "thus , measuring cmb polarization might provide additional information about the early universe .",
    "so far , only experimental upper limits have been set ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and the signal level is expected to be achieved through the use of new technology and instrument design ( p. t. timbie 1995 , private communication ) .    in previous calculations of the degree of cmb polarization",
    ", approximations have more or less been made . for instances ,",
    "the separation angle in the two - point auto - correlation functions has been assumed small , or / and the basis rotation from the @xmath1-basis of the perturbation to the fixed basis of an experiment has been totally neglected .",
    "although it is expected that these approximations would be valid for small - angle polarization calculations , they may break down on large - scale calculations . in this _ letter _ , we will compute the stokes parameters by taking into account the basis rotation effects .",
    "also , we will consider the two - point cross - correlation functions of the stokes parameters .",
    "polarized light is conventionally described in terms of four stokes parameters : @xmath2 , each of which is a function of the observational position in the universe , @xmath3 , as well as a unit vector pointing to the celestial sphere , @xmath4 . in polarization measurements",
    ", it is convenient to choose the north celestial pole as the reference axis , @xmath5 , and the linear polarization of the cmb is measured in terms of @xmath6 and @xmath7 defined by : @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the antenna temperature of radiation polarized along the north - south direction and so on ( @xcite )",
    ". let us define @xmath11 as the temperature fluctuation about the mean .",
    "it is known that @xmath12 would decouple from the other components .",
    "thus , we will calculate the stokes components @xmath13 of the cmb induced by scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "we first decompose @xmath13 into fourier components @xmath14 , which are induced by a fourier mode with wavevector @xmath15 .",
    "then , for a fixed @xmath16 , we solve the radiative transfer equation for the stokes parameters @xmath17 , which are defined with respect to the @xmath18 axis .",
    "the primed and unprimed parameters are related by a simple rotation ( @xcite ) , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , where the rotation angle @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 in the tensor - mode case , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for the @xmath26 mode solution , where ( @xmath27 ) are the polar angles of the unit vector @xmath28 in a coordinate system with @xmath18 as the polar axis . @xmath29 and @xmath30 are functions of @xmath31 only , usually expanded in terms of legendre polynomials : @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 have previously been calculated ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath36 mode solution is given by the same expressions except replacing @xmath37 by @xmath38 , and @xmath38 by @xmath39 .",
    "in the scalar - mode case , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "in cmb measurements , the measured stokes parameters are usually expanded in terms of the spherical harmonics , @xmath43 from this , we define the anisotropy power spectrum , @xmath44 , and the polarization power spectrum , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are given by similar expressions . in equation  ( [ ps ] ) , the angular brackets denote taking an average over all observational positions , i.e. , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 represents @xmath51 .    in the following , we will present the results for the anisotropy power spectrum , @xmath52 , and the polarization power spectrum , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent respectively the scalar and tensor contributions .",
    "specifically , we work in a flat cdm model with no recombination , in which the hubble parameter @xmath56 and the baryon density @xmath57 .",
    "also , we assume that @xmath58 , the scalar power index is @xmath59 , and the tensor s is @xmath60 .",
    "to evaluate the power spectra in equation  ( [ ps ] ) , we have used the boltzmann code ( @xcite ) to solve for @xmath34 and @xmath35 . for the anisotropy",
    ", the integral @xmath61 can be easily evaluated and analytic solutions for @xmath62 and @xmath63 can be found in terms of @xmath34 s ( @xcite ) . for the polarization , unfortunately , the multi - dimensional integrations involved in @xmath47 and @xmath48 are difficult .",
    "however , it has been attempted to calculate @xmath47 and @xmath48 approximately . in both scalar and tensor cases , by neglecting the basis rotation , i.e. , setting @xmath64 , analytic expressions for @xmath65 and @xmath66 have been obtained by @xcite . using these approximate formulae ,",
    "we have plotted in figure  1 the scalar contribution , @xmath67 , the tensor contribution , @xmath68 , and the total polarization .    to study the effect of the basis rotation",
    ", we numerically compute the integrals @xmath47 and @xmath48 using the gaussian quadratures integration method .",
    "we have computed the power spectra for @xmath69 with a @xmath0 accuracy ( improving the accuracy by an order of magnitude would require much more computer time ) .",
    "we have found that the coordinate - dependent stokes parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 are equal for a fixed @xmath70 , as expected for gaussian random perturbations .",
    "for the scalar mode , including the rotation angle does not apparently change the results from using the approximate formula with @xmath64 . on the contrary , in the tensor case , the multipoles for @xmath71 are modified , and the above approximation is valid only for @xmath72 .",
    "this is shown in figure  1 with solid symbols .",
    "note that @xmath73 is enhanced by an order of magnitude and now exceeds @xmath74 , and the tensor contribution is dominant for @xmath75 .",
    "this is contrary to the result in figure  3 of @xcite where the tensor contribution is subdominant for all @xmath70 . on the other hand , for a universe with standard recombination , the tensor contribution is predominant for multiples with @xmath71 ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ". thus , the tensor mode plays an important role in the large - scale polarization .",
    "although the basis rotation effect raises considerably the low multipoles of the tensor spectrum , it only slightly alters the r.m.s .",
    "degrees of polarization that have been calculated in @xcite .",
    "now , we can construct the auto - correlation functions .",
    "spatial isotropy guarantees that @xmath76 hence , the temperature auto - correlation function is given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the separation angle . for the polarization ,",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath7 only have cylindrical symmetry , so @xmath79 and @xmath80 do not have a relation like equation  ( [ tt ] ) . as such , we first take a whole - sky average which is denoted by the curly brackets , and then an average over all observational positions , namely , @xmath81 where we have used @xmath82 . in actual observations , @xmath83 in equation  ( [ tqu ] ) should be replaced by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a window function appropriate to a particular experiment",
    ". however , for many polarization measurements the window function only depends on @xmath70 and is simply inserted in equation  ( [ cf ] ) .",
    "it is interesting and useful to know the cross correlations among @xmath55 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the two - point cross - correlation functions @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 have been considered , where the axes specifically chosen to define the stokes parameters in the @xmath89 direction are @xmath90 and @xmath91 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these cross - correlation functions with this particular choice of axes have limited use in the sense of actual observations .",
    "essentially , this is because a single measurement of the stokes parameters at two specific directions @xmath92 and @xmath93 has a large sample variance .",
    "however , this variance can be reduced by surveying a larger part of the sky , and it approaches the inevitable cosmic variance for a whole - sky coverage .",
    "as such , it is valuable to consider the whole - sky averaged @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96",
    ".    let us consider @xmath95 first , from equations  ( [ tqu ] ) and ( [ ps ] ) , it is given by @xmath97 for the scalar mode , we obtain @xmath98 using the properties that @xmath99 is odd under the parity transformation : @xmath100 , and even under the transformation : @xmath101 , one can easily show that @xmath102 in equation  ( [ tu ] ) is identically zero , hence , @xmath103 .",
    "similar argument shows that @xmath104 , but it does not guarantee that @xmath94 vanishes .",
    "however , by direct evaluating the multi - dimensional integral , we have found that @xmath105 .",
    "for the tensor - mode case , similarly , using the parity properties of the angles @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath21 , one can show that @xmath103 , and @xmath104 .",
    "notice that the interference terms between the cross and plus modes in the integrals vanish as expected .",
    "for @xmath94 , we have evaluated the integral numerically and the result is consistent with zero .    as a result ,",
    "all full - sky averaged two - point cross - correlation functions vanish .",
    "this does not mean that there is no correlation between anisotropy and polarization .",
    "in fact , the correlated part has been extracted , and its polarization pattern has been correlated with the cold and hot spots of the microwave sky ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the zero result here only suggests that the correlated part has inherent symmetry over the whole sky .",
    "it is interesting to estimate how much the correlation is suppressed by averaging over an area of sky big enough to reduce the sample variance to acceptable levels .",
    "however , it can hardly be done without knowing the inherent symmetry , and the result should depend on sky sampling .",
    "therefore , it is important to find out the exact ( no approximations or whole - sky averaging ) correlation functions of the stokes parameters between any two arbitary points on the celestial sphere .",
    "this would reveal the symmetry , and be useful to measurements .",
    "we have tried to calculate a special case that is @xmath108 . for the scalar case ,",
    "the result is @xmath109 \\int k^2 dk \\alpha_l^ * \\beta_{l ' } , \\label{tq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is similar to the result given in @xcite except that our result has no azimuthal dependence .",
    "this is expected because @xmath6 has a cylindrical symmetry .",
    "equation  ( [ tq ] ) would be useful to the on - going polarization measurement that would observe an annulus of @xmath110 spots at constant declination ( p. t. timbie 1995 , private communication ) .",
    "if the spots are well separated , then the measured anisotropy - polarization correlation will be @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the anisotropy and polarization variances respectively , @xmath115 is the measured polar temperature anisotropy and @xmath116 .",
    "( we have neglected the detector noise . ) in a reionized universe , @xmath117 ( @xcite ) , hence the expected signal to noise ratio @xmath118 .",
    "when @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "whereas , the @xmath121 ratio of the polarization variance @xmath122 is @xmath123 .",
    "note that one is likely to find a relatively large @xmath124 when @xmath115 is not at a hot or cold spot on the microwave sky .",
    "we have calculated all whole - sky averaged two - point correlation functions of the stokes parameters of the cmb . incorporating the basis rotation effects , we have found that the tensor contribution to the polarization power spectrum get enhanced for low multipoles whereas the scalar contribution remains unchanged , and that all full - sky averaged cross - correlation functions vanish .",
    "a special case of @xmath125 has been calculated , and used to show that the signal to noise of @xmath125 is low for the polarization measurement underway .",
    "we intend to calculate the exact correlation functions that would be important to future polarization experiments ."
