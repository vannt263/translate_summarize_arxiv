    "* ) , while the non - thermal x - ray luminosity of 30  doradus  c reaches @xmath64 erg s@xmath0 or higher ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore likely that the non - thermal shell of 30  doradus  c was created by multiple supernova remnants during the last few thousand years .",
    "in addition , non - thermal x - ray peaks show good spatial correspondence with the molecular clouds mc15 on a 10-pc scale , while the co peaks show spatial offsets from the non - thermal x - ray peaks on a 1-pc scale .",
    "these trends are possible evidence for the shock - cloud interaction that appear in the galactic snrs rx  j1713.7@xmath253946 and rcw  86 @xcite . in 30  doradus  c ,",
    "the post - shocked gas density was at most @xmath650.4 @xmath4 as derived by the thermal x - rays in the southwest , whereas the interstellar proton density of the co cloud mc2 is estimated to be @xmath66 @xmath4 .",
    "it is therefore suspected that the ambient gas inside the shell is completely evacuated by the strong stellar winds and several snr shocks , while the co clouds are survivors of shock erosion as the shock speed will stall toward the dense clouds as @xmath67 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the large velocity difference between the co cloud surroundings and the inter - cloud space will enhance turbulence and magnetic field strength via the shock - cloud interaction . according to the three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations",
    ", the magnetic field strength will be amplified up to mg @xcite .",

    "@xcite recently announced tev @xmath1-ray detection towards 30  doradus  c. follow - up analysis with @xmath69-lat also resulted in the detection of an extended @xmath1-ray source west of 30  doradus  c .",
    "in this section , we combine our ism results with the x - ray , gev and tev observations to discuss the plausible hadronic / leptonic nature of this tev source . as we are however unsure about the association between the tev and gev sources , we thus use the @xmath69-lat spectral flux ( see black butterfly in figure [ fig_sed ] ) as a upper - limit .",
    "in the case of a hadronic scenario , @xmath1-ray emission originates from the decay of neutral pions produced by the cr - ism inelastic interaction . assuming an averaged ism proton density @xmath47(h@xmath48 + hi ) = 60 @xmath4 ( see previous section ) and a power - law distribution of crs with spectral index @xmath70 = 2.0",
    ", we note from figure [ fig_sed](a ) that the hadronic sed reproduces the h.e.s.s .",
    "observation for a total energy budget @xmath71 = @xmath72 erg and a cr distribution energy cut - off @xmath73 = 100 tev .",
    "the hadronic gamma - ray flux being sensitive to the ism proton density , the upcoming cherenkov telescope array ( cta , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with its arc - min spatial resolution and increased sensitivity could help highlight the @xmath1-ray emission produced inside the various aforementioned molecular clouds .",
    "as an example we focus on the cloud mc3 as it spatially overlaps the tev emission and is similar in angular scale to the cta resolution . with cta",
    "s ability to achieve arc - min scale angular resolution , it may be able to resolve the tev @xmath1-ray emission towards molecular cloud cores and hence probe the diffusion properties of cosmic - rays into such cores . based on the volume ratio between the cloud mc3 and the superbubble 30  doradus  c , we assume that a fraction @xmath74 of the cr energy budget @xmath71 resides inside this molecular cloud . using the previous cr spectral shape ,",
    "we observe that the flux produced inside molecular cloud mc3 ( see dashed line in figure [ fig_sed](a ) ) could be detected , and perhaps resolved by cta after at least 50 hours of observations .",
    "alternatively , @xmath1-ray emission is also produced by high energy electrons from bremsstrahlung and inverse - compton radiation . as the type ( continuous / impulsive ) and age of the high energy source remains unconstrained ,",
    "we intentionally do not use a time - dependent evolution of the energy distribution of electrons as @xcite . in order to account for the effect of radiative cooling at high energies ( i.e. synchrotron and inverse - compton )",
    ", we instead use a broken power - law distribution @xmath75 with @xmath76 = @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 . as per @xcite",
    "we also assume two populations of ir target photons coming from 30  doradus  c ( @xmath81 = 40 k , @xmath82 = 0.5 ev @xmath4 ) and the tarantula nebula ( @xmath83 = 88 k , @xmath84 = 1.5 ev @xmath4 ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig_sed](b ) , the leptonic sed matches the x - ray and tev data if we assume a distribution of electrons with energy budget @xmath85 erg , spectral indices @xmath77 = 2.0 and @xmath86 = 3.4 , @xmath87 = 10 tev , @xmath73 = 100 tev and an averaged magnetic field @xmath88 = 15 @xmath89 g .",
    "we note that the bremsstrahlung contribution is negligible at high energies .",
    "finally , we argued in the previous section that the x - ray detections are non - thermal and can thus be explained by the propagation of high energy electrons towards the dense molecular clouds and their enhanced magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , they are expected to undergo severe energy losses from synchrotron and ic radiation and , unlike the hadronic scenario , no inverse - compton tev emission should then be detected by cta inside the molecular clouds .",
    "we summarize the present work as follows ;    1 .",
    "we identified molecular and atomic gas associated with the superbubble 30  doradus  c using the mopra @xmath11co ( @xmath12 = 10 ) and atca @xmath45 parkes hi datasets .",
    "five co clouds are distributed along the non - thermal x - ray shell in the west , while three of the hi clouds are located at the northwest , southwest , and southeast .",
    "the thermal x - rays are brighter in the eastern shell , where there are no dense co / hi clouds ; conversely , the western shell has dense co / hi clouds and no evidence for thermal x - rays .",
    "the non - thermal x - rays are clearly enhanced around the molecular clouds on a pc scale , suggesting possible evidence for magnetic field amplification via the shock - cloud interaction .",
    "3 .   the tev @xmath1-ray peak exhibits a good spatial correspondence with the distribution of the total interstellar proton column density as well as that of the non - thermal x - rays . if the hadronic process dominates , the total energy of the cosmic - ray protons will amount to at least @xmath2 erg with the mean interstellar proton density of @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "4 .   the @xmath1-ray flux associated with the molecular cloud ( e.g. , mc3 ) could be detected and resolved by cta .",
    "this should permit cta to probe the diffusion of cosmic - rays into the associated dense ism .",

    "<S> we analyzed the 2.6-mm co and 21-cm hi lines toward the magellanic superbubble 30  doradus  c , in order to reveal the associated molecular and atomic gas . </S>",
    "<S> we uncovered five molecular clouds in a velocity range from 251 to 276 km s@xmath0 toward the western shell . </S>",
    "<S> the non - thermal x - rays are clearly enhanced around the molecular clouds on a pc scale , suggesting possible evidence for magnetic field amplification via shock - cloud interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal x - rays are brighter in the eastern shell , where there are no dense molecular or atomic clouds , opposite to the western shell . </S>",
    "<S> the tev @xmath1-ray distribution may spatially match the total interstellar proton column density as well as the non - thermal x - rays . if the hadronic @xmath1-ray is dominant , the total energy of the cosmic - ray protons is at least @xmath2 erg with the estimated mean interstellar proton density @xmath3 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the @xmath1-ray flux associated with the molecular cloud ( e.g. , mc3 ) could be detected and resolved by the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) . </S>",
    "<S> this should permit cta to probe the diffusion of cosmic - rays into the associated dense ism . </S>"
