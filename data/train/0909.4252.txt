    "gravitational waves ( gws ) are a natural consequence of einstein s theory of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "gws will open a new astronomical window for the study of the universe transforming the research in gr into an observational / theoretical study .",
    "in particular , the opening of the full electromagnetic spectrum to astronomical observation during the last century expanded our comprehension of the universe . in this century",
    ", observations across the gravitational wave spectrum will provide a wealth of new knowledge , including the possibility of studying the period when the first stars were formed in the universe in the end of the so - called ` dark ages ' .",
    "the information provided by gws is different when compared to that provided by electromagnetic waves .",
    "gws carry detailed information on the coherent bulk motions of matter , such as those produced by the collapse of stellar cores generating , for example , black hole remnants . on the other hand ,",
    "electromagnetic waves are usually an incoherent superposition of emissions from individual atoms , molecules , and charged particles .    because of the fact that gws are produced by a large variety of astrophysical sources and cosmological phenomena , it is quite probable that the universe is pervaded by a background of such waves .",
    "collapse of population ii and iii stars , phase transitions in the early universe , cosmic strings , and a variety of binary stars are examples of sources that could produce such a putative background of gws ( see , e.g. , @xcite among others ) .",
    "note that the indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational waves came first from observations of the orbital decay of the hulse - taylor binary pulsar @xcite .",
    "direct detection though and analysis of gravitational - wave sources are expected to provide a unique insight to one of the least understood of the fundamental forces @xcite .",
    "they will also allow us to investigate the physical properties of objects that do not emit any electromagnetic radiation as for example isolated black holes .",
    "a number of interferometers designed for gravitational wave detection are currently in operation , being developed , or planned .",
    "in particular , the high frequency part of the gravitational wave spectrum ( @xmath8 ) is open today through the pioneering efforts of the first - generation ground - based interferometers such as ligo . while detections from this first generation of detectors are likely to be rare , the advanced ligo upgrade may detect , among others , the stochastic signal generated by a population of pre - galactic stars .",
    "thus , in the future , it may be possible to use gws as a tool for studying the star formation at high redshifts .",
    "in particular , from the theoretical point of view , it can be found in the literature several works discussing this possibility .",
    "for example , the gravitational wave background ( gwb ) generated from the core collapse supernovae resulting in black holes at high redshifts has been discussed by @xcite among others .",
    "on the other hand , the calculation made specifically for population iii supernovae resulting in black holes is presented in @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite calculated the gwb from population iii stars with the cosmic star formation history in the framework of hierarchical structure formation . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite presented the gwb spectrum of population iii stars by calculating the gw waveforms based on results of hydrodynamic core - collapsed simulations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that in all of these works , one of the most important parameters responsible to characterize the gwb is the cosmic star formation rate ( csfr ) .",
    "concerning to the csfr at high redshift , our knowledge is mainly based on numerical simulations performed by hydrodynamical codes in a @xmath9-cdm cosmology .",
    "certainly , these simulations must reproduce the observable universe at redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the evidence for the existence of a large star formation at high redshift comes from , among others , the gunn - peterson effect @xcite and from the metallicity of @xmath11 found in @xmath12 ly@xmath13 forest clouds @xcite .    these results are consistent with a stellar population formed at @xmath14 @xcite . however , measuring the csfr from observations requires a number of assumptions , with the form of the dust obscuration corrections and the stellar initial mass function @xcite .",
    "our main goal in the present paper is to discuss how the detection of a gwb could be used to give us some insight on the csfr .",
    "this kind of study could also be used to constrain the fraction of massive stars that generates black holes at high redshift , and the efficiency of production of gws by black holes whose distribution function is presently unknown . to do so",
    ", we use a hierarchical structure formation model similar to that developed by @xcite .",
    "however , in our model the csfr is obtained in a self - consistent way .",
    "that means , we solve the equation governing the total gas density taking into account the baryon accretion rate , treated as a infall term , and the lifetime of the stars formed in the dark halos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the press - schechter - like ( ps ) formalism used to determine the comoving abundance of collapsed dark matter halos . in section 3",
    ", we discuss how to obtain the csfr from the hierarchical model . in section 4",
    ", we present the formalism used to characterize the gwb .",
    "section 5 presents our conclusions .",
    "press and schechter ( hereafter ps ) heuristically derived a mass function for bound virialized objects in 1974 @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the ps approach is define halos as concentrations of mass that have already left the linear regime by crossing the threshold @xmath15 for non - linear collapse .",
    "given a power spectrum and a window function , it should then be relatively straightforward to calculate the halo mass function as a function of the mass and redshift .",
    "however , it is worth stressing that the exact definition of the mass function , e.g. , integrated versus differential form or count versus number density , varies widely in the literature . to characterize different fits ,",
    "it can be introduced the scale differential mass function @xmath16 @xcite defined as a fraction of the total mass per @xmath17 that belongs to halos .",
    "that is ,    @xmath18}.\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the number density of halos with mass @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the background density at redshift @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the variance of the linear density field . as pointed out by @xcite , this definition of the mass function has the advantage that it does not explicitly depend on redshift , power spectrum , or cosmology ; all of these are contained in @xmath23 ( see also @xcite ) .    to calculate @xmath23 , the power spectrum",
    "@xmath24 is smoothed with a spherical top - hat filter function of radius @xmath25 , which on average encloses a mass @xmath20 @xmath26^{1/3})$ ] .",
    "thus ,    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the top - hat filter :    @xmath29,\\ ] ]    and the redshift dependence enters only through the growth factor @xmath30 .",
    "then ,    @xmath31    in the more general case of a universe with matter and a cosmological constant , the exact solution for the growth function is well approximated by @xcite :    @xmath32},\\ ] ]    where the relative density of the @xmath33component is given by @xmath34 , and ` @xmath35 ' applying for baryons ( b ) , dark energy ( @xmath36 , and total matter ( m ) , while @xmath37 is the cosmological scale factor .    as usual , the primordial power spectrum is assumed to have a power law dependence on scale , that is , @xmath38 . for a scale - invariant spectrum",
    "the spectral index is @xmath39 .",
    "the rate at which fluctuations grow on different scales is determined by an interplay between self - gravitation , pressure support and damping processes .",
    "these effects lead to a modification of the form of the primordial power spectrum that is expressed in terms of a transfer function @xmath40 .",
    "thus , we have :    @xmath41    where the normalization factor @xmath42 is determined observationally .    for the transfer function , we consider @xcite :    @xmath43^{\\nu}\\}^{2/\\nu}},\\ ] ]    with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the so - called shape parameter of the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "we use throughout this work the mass function fit proposed by @xcite .",
    "that is ,    @xmath49\\label{est},\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    at redshift @xmath22 ,",
    "the comoving density of dark matter halos in the mass range @xmath52 $ ] is @xmath53 , with ( see , in particular , @xcite )    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the comoving dark matter density .",
    "we consider that the baryon distribution traces the dark matter distribution without bias .",
    "thus , the density of baryons is proportional to the density of dark matter . the fact that stars can form only in structures that are suitably dense can be parameterized by the threshold mass @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the fraction of baryons at redshift @xmath22 that are in structures is given by    @xmath57    with this definition , the baryon accretion rate @xmath58 which accounts for the increase in the fraction of baryons in structures is given by @xcite :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the critical density of the universe .",
    "the age of the universe that appears in ( [ abaryon ] ) is related to the redshift by :    @xmath61    in eq .",
    "( [ fbaryon ] ) we have used as upper limit @xmath62 .",
    "this choice permits a reasonable computational time to run the models .",
    "moreover , models with @xmath63 showed no considerable difference in the results . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss how to obtain the csfr from the hierarchical scenario here described .",
    "in hierarchical models for galaxy formation the first star - forming halos are predicted to collapse at redshift @xmath64 , having masses @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "in particular , the star formation history for a ` galactic - like system ' is determined by the interplay between incorporation of baryons into collapsed objetcs ( stars , stellar remnants , and smaller objects ) and return of baryons into diffuse state ( gaseous clouds and intercloud medium of the system ) .",
    "the later process can be two - fold : ( a ) mass return from stars to the ` interstellar medium of the system ' through , for example , stellar winds , and supernovae , which happens at the local level ; and ( b ) net global infall of baryons from outside of the system .",
    "the former process is a well - known and firmly established part of the standard stellar evolution lore ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and although details of mass - loss in a particular stellar type may still be controversial , there is nothing controversial in the basic physics of this process .",
    "thus , we use throughout this paper the basic process above described . to do that , we consider the baryon accretion rate @xmath58 , described by eq .",
    "( [ abaryon ] ) , as an infall term that supplies the reservoir represented by the halos .",
    "therefore , the number of stars formed by unity of volume , mass and time is given by :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the initial mass function ( imf ) which gives the distribution function of stellar masses , and @xmath68 is the star formation rate . see that @xmath68 is assumed to be independent of mass while @xmath67 is assumed to be independent of time .",
    "we use a schmidt law @xcite for @xmath68",
    ". therefore ,    @xmath69^{\\alpha},\\label{sclaw}\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 is a constant that will be identified later , @xmath71 is the local gas density , and @xmath72 .",
    "see that ( [ sclaw ] ) shows that stars are formed by the gas contained in the halos .    on the other hand ,",
    "we assume that the imf follows the @xcite form    @xmath73    where @xmath74 ( our fiducial value ) and @xmath75 is a normalization factor .    the constant @xmath75 is determined by the condition which all stars are formed into the mass range @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "that is ,    @xmath77    and we consider @xmath78 and @xmath79 as limits in ( [ norimf ] ) .",
    "the mass ejected from stars , for example through winds and supernovae , is returned to the ` interstellar medium of the system ' .",
    "thus , we have :    @xmath80    where the lower limit of the integral , @xmath81 , corresponds to the stellar mass whose lifetime is equal to @xmath82 . in the integrand",
    ", @xmath83 is the mass of the remnant , which depends on the progenitor mass , and the star formation rate is taken at the retarded time @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the lifetime of a star of mass @xmath86 .    for all stars formed in the halos , we use the metallicity - independent fit of @xcite    @xmath87^{2},\\ ] ]    where @xmath85 is the stellar lifetime given in years .",
    "the mass of the remnant , @xmath83 , in eq .",
    "( [ mej1 ] ) is calculated using the following assumptions :    \\a ) stars with @xmath88 have a high lifetime so they do not contribute for @xmath89 ;    \\b ) stars with @xmath90 after evolving off the main sequence left carbon - oxygen white dwarfs as remnants , where    @xmath91    \\c ) stars in the range @xmath92 after evolving off the main sequence left oxygen - neon - magnesium white dwarfs with @xmath93 ;    \\d ) stars with @xmath94 explode as supernovae leaving neutron stars as remnants ( @xmath95 ) ;    \\e ) stars with @xmath96 produce black hole remnants . in this case",
    ", we consider that @xmath97 .",
    "note that @xmath98 is the mass of the helium core before collapse ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus ,    @xmath99    then , using equations ( [ sclaw ] ) and ( [ mej1 ] ) we can write an equation governing the total gas density ( @xmath100 ) in the halos . namely ,    @xmath101    where @xmath58 , eq . ( [ abaryon ] ) , gives the rate at which the halos accrete mass .",
    "numerical integration of ( [ rhogas ] ) produces the function @xmath102 at each time @xmath82 ( or redshift @xmath22 ) .",
    "once obtained @xmath102 , we return to eq .",
    "( [ sclaw ] ) in order to obtain the ` cosmic star formation rate ' @xmath103 . just replacing @xmath103 by @xmath104 we can write    @xmath105    where the constant @xmath70 represents the inverse of the timescale for star formation .",
    "namely , @xmath106 .",
    "we normalize the csfr in order to produce @xmath107 at @xmath108 . with this normalization",
    ", we obtain a good agreement with both the present value of the csfr derived by @xcite , who employed hydrodynamic simulations of structure formation , and the observational points taken from @xcite .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in our models are : @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , and hubble constant @xmath113 with @xmath114 .    in the figure 1 we present the csfr derived from our models in function of the threshold mass @xmath56 ( see eq .",
    "[ fbaryon ] ) .",
    "we use a imf with slope @xmath74 , @xmath115 as timescale for star formation , and we consider that stars start to form at redshift @xmath116 . as can be seen , models with @xmath117 have an excellent agreement with the observational csfr at redshifts @xmath0 .",

    "we also included the csfr derived by springel & hernquist ( sh ) for comparison .",

    ", we can see the influence of @xmath56 ( the threshold mass for halo formation ) on the csfr .",

    "we consider @xmath74 , @xmath116 , and we take @xmath122 for the threshold mass .",
    "note that , @xmath125 produces a gas comsuption timescale compatible with early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "thus , the first basic effect of increasing @xmath126 is to shift the peak of the csfr to lower redshifts .",
    "that means , the higher the @xmath124 parameter , the lower is the readshift where appears the peak of @xmath104 . in particular ,",
    "the peak of @xmath104 is shifted from redshift 3.3 if @xmath127 to 6.1 if @xmath128 .",
    "the parameter @xmath124 is also related to the amplitude of @xmath104 ( see also eq . [ csfr ] ) .",
    "see that considering @xmath122 then the models with @xmath129 are those that present the best concordance with the observational data .",
    "it is worth stressing that both parameters , @xmath56 and @xmath124 , produce similar effects on the results .",
    "that is , they act on the amplitude of @xmath104 and on the value of @xmath118 . in figure 2",
    "is also included the csfr derived by springel & hernquist for comparison .    ) on the results .",
    "the solid line represents the springel & hernquist csfr ( sh ) , the dashed line corresponds to @xmath130 , the short dashed line corresponds to @xmath131 , the dotted line corresponds to @xmath132 , and the dot - dashed line represents @xmath133 .",
    "these models have a threshold mass @xmath134 , and a imf with slope @xmath74 .",
    "hp stands for the observational csfr @xcite.,width=340 ]    in figure 3 we see the influence of @xmath135 on the evolution of @xmath104 .",
    "the models have similar evolution at @xmath120 .",
    "however , at larger redshifts , the model with @xmath136 produces a csfr higher than that obtained from @xmath116 .",
    "in particular , the peak of the csfr occurs at redshift 4.6 ( 5.5 ) for the model with @xmath116 ( @xmath136 ) .     and @xmath134 but considering two different values for the initial redshift .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the springel & hernquist csfr ( sh ) , the dashed line corresponds to @xmath116 , and the short dashed line corresponds to @xmath136 .",
    "hp stands for the observational csfr @xcite.,width=340 ]    it is worth stressing that the csfr is inferred from observations of the light emitted by stars at various wavelengths .",
    "these observable samples are flux - limited , and thus the intrinsic luminosity of the faintest objects in the sample changes with redshift .",
    "this incompleteness of the samples is corrected by using a functional ( schechter function ) to the luminosity function obtained from the observations themselves .",
    "an important parameter on the determination of the csfr is the obscuration by dust that is well known to affect measurements of galaxy luminosty at ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical wavelengths .",
    "correcting for this effect is not always straightforward .",
    "thus , there are large uncertainties associated to the determination of the csfr as can be seen from figures @xmath137 ( see , in particular , @xcite who discuss these uncertainties with more details ) .",
    "in this section we use the csfr ( @xmath104 ) obtained from the hierarchical model to determine the stochastic background of gravitational waves ( sbgws ) generated by stars which collapse to black holes .",
    "initially , we present a quick overview on the formalism used to characterize a sbgws because this subject is discussed in previous works ( see , for example , @xcite ) . after this quick overview we display and compare the results of the models considered .",
    "let us write the specific flux received in gws at the present epoch as    @xmath138    where    @xmath139    is the comoving specific luminosity density ( given , e.g , in @xmath140 ) , which obviously refers to the source frame .",
    "see that @xmath141 is the comoving volume element , and @xmath142 is the luminosity distance .",
    "the above equations are valid to estimate a stochastic background radiation received on earth independent of its origin . in the present paper @xmath143",
    "can be written as follows    @xmath144    where @xmath145 is the specific energy of the source .",
    "note that in the above equation @xmath146 is the csfr , and @xmath147 is the imf .",
    "thus , the flux @xmath148 received on earth reads    @xmath149    in particular , one can write the differential rate of production of gws , for the case of a background produced by an ensamble of black holes , as follows    @xmath150    using eq.([dr_bh ] ) it follows that    @xmath151    note that in the above equation , what multiplies @xmath152 is nothing but the specific energy flux per unity frequency ( in , e.g. , @xmath153 ) , i.e. ,    @xmath154    on the other hand , the specific energy flux per unit frequency for gws is given by @xcite    @xmath155    also , the spectral energy density , the flux of gws , received on earth , @xmath156 , in @xmath157 can be written as    @xmath158    from the above equations one obtains    @xmath159    see that @xmath160 is the dimensionaless amplitude produced by the collapse of a star to form a black hole . its expression is obtained from @xcite .",
    "thus ,    @xmath161    where @xmath4 is the efficiency of generation of gw s , and @xmath83 is the mass of the black hole formed .",
    "it is worth mentioning that eq .",
    "( [ h_bh ] ) refers to the black hole ` ringing ' , which has to do with the de - excitation of the black hole quasi - normal modes .    the collapse of a star to black hole produces a signal with frequency @xmath162 given by    @xmath163    where the factor @xmath164 takes into account the redshift effect on the emission frequency",
    "that is , a signal emitted at frequency @xmath165 at redshift @xmath22 is observed at frequency @xmath166 .    as discussed in the previous section",
    ", we consider that black holes are formed from stars with @xmath167 .",
    "the mass of the remnant is taken to be the mass of the helium core before collapse ( see eq .",
    "[ mr ] ) .",
    "another relevant physical quantity associated with the sbgws is the closure energy density per logarithmic frequency span , which is given by    @xmath168    the above equation can be re - written as    @xmath169    thus , given a star formation history , consisting of a star formation rate per comoving volume ( csfr ) , @xmath146 , and an initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath147 , the stochastic background of gravitational waves produced by pre - galactic black holes can be characterize .    finally , to assess the detectability of a gw signal , one must evaluate the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , which for a pair of interferometers is given by ( see , for example , @xcite )    @xmath170,\\label{signal}\\ ] ]    where @xmath171 is the spectral noise density , @xmath172 is the integration time , and @xmath173 is the overlap reduction function , which depends on the relative positions and orientations of the two interferometers . for the @xmath173 function",

    "the second criterion is to produce a signal - to - noise @xmath179 for a pair of ` advanced ' interferometers .",

    "figure 4 presents the models with @xmath122 which satisfy the above criteria .     and good agreement with observational data .",
    "the main characteristics of these models are described in table 1.,width=340 ]    table 1 shows the main results for the six models @xmath182 which are presented in figure 4 .",
    "the efficiency of generation of gws is taken from @xcite who simulated the axisymmetric collapse of a rotating star to black hole .",

    "however , as discussed in @xcite , both formulations presented similar results .    since some authors use , instead of @xmath186 , the gravitational strain @xmath196 , defined by @xcite as    @xmath197    we show this quantity in figure 8 .",
    "results are shown for the models @xmath198 of the table 1.,width=340 ]    .",
    "results are shown for the models @xmath198 of the table 1.,width=340 ]    a key parameter to determine the values presented in tables 1 , 2 , and 3 is the efficiency of generation of gws .",
    "we take the maximum efficiency found by @xcite , namely , @xmath183 for an axisymmetric collapse resulting in a black hole .",
    "on the other hand , more recently , @xcite obtained the efficiency of @xmath199 for a @xmath200 black hole remnant . note that since @xmath201 , if the efficiency is actually closer to @xmath199 , the observed energy density in gravitational waves may be divided by a factor of 35 . in this case , of all models here studied only model a6 will produce @xmath6 .",
    "however , the distribution of @xmath4 in function of the mass of a black hole is unknown .",
    "in particular , let us think of what occurs with other compact objects @xmath202 namely , the neutron stars @xmath202 to see if we can learn something from them .",
    "a newly born neutron star could lose angular momentum due to gravitational waves associated with non - radial oscillations @xcite .",
    "this could explain why all known young neutron stars are relatively slow rotators .",
    "the black holes could have had a similar history , i.e , they could have been formed rapidly rotating and lost momentum to gravitational radiation via their quasi - normal modes .",
    "if this was the case , the value of @xmath4 could be near the maximum one , or in the worst case , it could have a value to produce @xmath179 for a ligo iii pair .",
    "in this work , we have used the hierarchical formation scenario derived from the press - schechter formalism to build the cosmic star formation rate - csfr in a self - consistent way .",
    "our paper differs from earlier works basically in the form as is obtained the function @xmath104 ( or csfr ) .",
    "in particular , from the hierarchical scenario we obtain the baryon accretion rate , @xmath58 , that supplies the gaseous reservoir in the halos .",
    "thus , the term @xmath58 is treated as an infall term in our model .",
    "this scenario is in agreement with the cold dark matter model of cosmological structure formation , where the first sources of light are expected to form in @xmath65 dark matter potential at @xmath203 .",
    "using @xmath104 we calculate the stochastic background of gravitational waves produced by pre - galactic black holes .",
    "we show that a significant amount of gws is produced related to the history of csfr studied here , and this sbgws can in principle be detected by a pair of ligo iii interferometers .",
    "note that signal - to - noise ratios @xmath204 could be obtained if the efficiency of generation of gws is close to the maximum value ( @xmath183 ) , if the imf produces a high number of massive remnants ( @xmath2 ) , and if @xmath205 . considering a salpeter imf ( @xmath74 )",
    ", we obtain signal - to - noise ratios @xmath206 .",
    "the critical parameter to be constrained in the case of a non - detection is @xmath4 .",
    "a non - detection would mean that the efficiency of gws during the formation of black holes is not high enough .",
    "in reality , @xmath207 should be divided by a factor @xmath208 in the case of a non - detection .",
    "it is worth mentioning that an imf with @xmath178 could also be responsible for a non - detection same with @xmath209 .",
    "however , @xmath178 produces a high number of low mass stars that is not in agreement with recent numerical simulations of the collapse and fragmentation of primordial clouds ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    another possibility for a non - detection",
    "is that the pre - galactic stars are such that the black holes formed had masses @xmath210 . in this case , the gw frequency band would be out of the ligo bandwidth .",
    "however , considering black holes formed from stars with masses @xmath211 , then the sensitivity of the future third generation of detectors could be high enough to increase one order of magnitude in the expected value of ( s / n ) .",
    "examples of such detectors are the large scale cryogenic gravitational wave telescope ( lcgt ) and the european antenna ego ( see @xcite and the references therein for a short discussion on this subject ) .",
    "specifically , around @xmath212 the planned strain noise for ego will be a factor of @xmath213 higher than that provided for advanced ligo configuration .",
    "this could represent a gain of a factor @xmath214 for the value of ( s / n ) considering two interferometers located at the same place ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus , some models in tables @xmath137 could survive with @xmath6 same with @xmath215 .    in particular , the detection of a background with significant ( s / n ) would permit us to obtain the curve @xmath196 ( or @xmath186 ) versus @xmath162 . from it , one can constrain @xmath104 at high redshifts and the gravitational wave efficiency ( @xmath4 ) . thus , the detection and characterization of a sbgws could be used as a tool for study of the star formation at high redshifts .",
    "it is worth stressing that several astrophysical sources can contribute to the background of gravitational waves , as mentioned in the introduction . in principle",
    ", it should be possible to distinguish different sources from the detected gravitational wave spectrum .",
    "that is , from the caractheristics of the observed curve @xmath186 versus @xmath162 .",
    "for example , in the present work we have shown that cosmological stellar black holes ( @xmath216 ) , formed at @xmath217 , produce a stochastic background in the frequency range @xmath218 .",
    "in particular , the gravitational wave spectra peak at @xmath219 .",
    "if the black hole population forms at low redshifts ( for example , @xmath220 ) , both the frequency where @xmath186 peaks and the minimum frequency of the spectra will be shifted to greater frequencies than those presented here .",
    "however , the shape of @xmath186 does not considerably change if we consider the same gravitational wave energy power spectrum for the sources . on the other hand , more massive stars ( @xmath221 ) will shifted the peak of the spectra for low frequencies .",
    "see for a moment the results of @xcite for black hole remnants of population iii stars with masses @xmath222 .",
    "their spectrum peaks at @xmath223 ( @xmath224 ) and the maximum frequency of the background is @xmath225 .",
    "another example can be seen from the work of @xcite .",
    "the authors studied the gravitational wave background from all cosmic supernovae .",
    "their fiducial model peaks at @xmath226 ( @xmath227 ) while the maximum frequency of the background is @xmath228 and the spectrum can extent to very low frequencies ( @xmath229 ) .",
    "thus , in principle , it would be possible to identify the signatures of different backgrounds if we have the curve @xmath186 versus @xmath162 over a large range in frequency .",
    "last but not least , we refer the reader to the work of @xcite who present a unified model for the evolution of galaxies and quasars .",
    "specifically , these authors discuss that gas cooling is not efficient in too massive structures and so haloes with circular velocity greater than @xmath230 could not form stars .",
    "if we take into account their results then the upper limit , @xmath231 , in equation ( [ fbaryon ] ) should be changed for @xmath232 .",
    "we checked all the models described in tables @xmath137 with this new upper limit ( @xmath233 ) .",
    "we verify that the amplitude of the csfr decreases slightly at @xmath234 when compared with the results obtained using @xmath235 ( at @xmath236 we do not observe any modification in the behaviour of @xmath104 ) .",
    "for the models with @xmath122 ( @xmath175 ) there is only a subtle modification in the final results . in particular , the signal - to - noise ratios are @xmath237 ( @xmath238 ) lower than those presented in table 1 ( 2 ) . for the models with @xmath119 we note a modification @xmath239 in the results of the table 3 .",
    "however , all models presented in tables @xmath137 satisfy the `` two criteria '' , as discussed in section 4 .",
    "that is , same using @xmath233 the models produce @xmath6 and @xmath181 .",
    "esp and odm thank cludia v. rodrigues , ronaldo e. de souza , jos c.n . de araujo , and jos a. de freitas pacheco for helpful discussions .",
    "the authors would like to thank the referee for helpful comments that we feel considerably improved the paper .",
