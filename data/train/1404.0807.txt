    "the problem of increasing the profit of nos in cellular wireless networks has been already studied in the literature , where several papers on this topic have been published .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , the problem of forming multiple stable coalitions of bss , in order to reduce energy consumption and to increase the profit of different and selfish nos , has never been tackled before . in our work",
    ", we pursue this problem by proposing a novel approach based on mathematical optimization and on the coalition formation game theory .    much of current research focuses indeed on energy saving techniques as a way to reduce no costs @xcite .",
    "for instance , works like @xcite use optimization techniques and traffic profile patterns to determine when and where to switch off bss , while those like @xcite use cell - zooming techniques to adaptively adjust the cell size according to traffic load and to possibly switch off inactive cells .",
    "other works , like @xcite , focus on techniques to improve spectrum efficiency in order to enhance the utilization of data subcarriers and thus to better amortize the license costs of frequency bands .",
    "these techniques , however , do not consider the cooperation among different nos , and therefore are unable , unlike our approach , to exploit the advantages brought by such a cooperation .",
    "furthermore , they do not jointly tackle the problems of ensuring qos to users and of reducing energy consumption .",
    "approaches attempting to jointly achieve qos and energy savings have been recently proposed @xcite .    in @xcite , a static joint planning and management optimization approach to limit energy consumption ( by switching bss on and off according to the traffic load ) while guaranteeing qos and minimizing no costs is proposed .",
    "this approach , however , is inherently static ( it operates at network design time ) so , unlike ours , is unable to operate in a dynamic environment .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors present a cooperative game - theoretic approach , in which individual access networks with insufficient resources join to form the grand - coalition in order to satisfy service demands .",
    "this proposal is unable to support non trivial scenarios featuring multiple nos , a time - varying number of connected users , the energy consumption and the costs due to coalition formation and operation , that may prevent the formation of the grand coalition in favor of smaller and more stable coalitions .",
    "conversely , these scenarios are properly dealt with by our work .    in @xcite , a game - theoretic approach for the energy - efficient operation of heterogeneous lte cellular networks , belonging to a single no , is proposed .",
    "this approach , however , does not guarantee the stability of the coalitions that are formed , while stability is a core property of our solution .",
    "furthermore , it is unable to deal with complex scenarios featuring multiple nos possibly exhibiting different energy prices , and a time - varying population of users .",
    "in contrast , our algorithm is able to deal with the above scenarios , and always yield stable coalitions .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a hierarchical dynamic game framework to increase the capacity of two - tier cellular networks by offloading traffic from macro cells to small cells .",
    "this work does not take into account the opportunity to selectively switch off underutilized bss thus offloading the related users to the remaining switched - on bss .",
    "therefore , our approach can be considered complementary to this one , as it is able to provide a profitable way to select what macro cells to consider before applying the proposed hierarchical game .",
    "this paper presents a novel dynamic cooperation scheme among a group of cellular nos to achieve profit maximization .",
    "we propose a cooperative game - theoretic framework to study the problem of forming stable coalitions among nos , and a mathematical optimization model to allocate users to a set of bss , in order to reduce no costs and , at the same time , to meet user qos .",
    "our solution adopts a distributed approach in which the best solution arises without the need to synchronize the various nos or to resort to a trusted third party , and such that no no can benefit by moving from its coalition to another ( possibly empty ) one .    in the proposed scheme , we model the cooperation among the nos as a coalition game with transferable utility and we devise a hedonic shift algorithm to form stable coalitions .",
    "with our algorithm , each no autonomously and selfishly decides whether to leave the current coalition to join a different one according to his preference , meanwhile improving its perceived net profit .",
    "we prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a nash - stable partition which determines the resulting coalition structure .",
    "our algorithm can be readily implemented in a distributed fashion , given that each no can act independently and asynchronously from any other no in the system .",
    "furthermore , the asynchronicity of our algorithm makes it able to adapt to environmental changes ( like new user arrivals ) .    to prove the effectiveness of our approach",
    ", we perform a thorough numerical evaluation by means of trace - based simulation , using realistic scenarios and real - world traffic data . to evaluate the performance of our algorithms , we vary , in a controlled way , the values of its input parameters , like the energy cost and the user heterogeneity .",
    "the future developments of this research is following several directions .",
    "firstly , we want to extend our work to include cellular networks sparsely deployed in wider geographical areas . to do so , we will have to take into account several issues , like the network coverage problem , whereby a bs can be switched off only if a group of neighboring bss can cover the area it serves .    as as second research direction",
    ", we want to explore different variants of our algorithm , especially suited for large cellular networks . specifically , when the number of bss increases , the time to convergence of our algorithm may be too long for practical uses , especially for small values of the discretization step . in these cases , it would be better to renounce to the quality of the obtained solution in favor of a more readily available solution .",
    "our current algorithm always provides the best solution ( i.e. , a nash - stable partition ) , but at the cost of visiting , in the worst case , all possible coalitions . to this end , we want to design an _ anytime",
    "_ version of our algorithm ( i.e. , an algorithm which can return a  possibly suboptimal  solution any time ) and we want to compare its performance with the current one .      40 natexlab#1#1[1]`#1 ` [ 2]#2 [ 1]#1 [ 1]http://dx.doi.org/#1 [ ] [ 1]pmid:#1 [ ] [ 2]#2 , , , .",

    "<S> in this paper , we deal with the problem of maximizing the profit of _ network operators _ ( nos ) of green cellular networks in situations where _ quality - of - service _ ( qos ) guarantees must be ensured to users , and _ base stations _ ( bss ) can be shared among different operators .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that if nos cooperate among them , by mutually sharing their users and bss , then each one of them can improve its net profit .    by using a game - theoretic framework , </S>",
    "<S> we study the problem of forming _ stable _ </S>",
    "<S> coalitions among nos . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we propose a mathematical optimization model to allocate users to a set of bss , in order to reduce costs and , at the same time , to meet user qos for nos inside the same coalition . based on this </S>",
    "<S> , we propose an algorithm , based on cooperative game theory , that enables each operator to decide with whom to cooperate in order to maximize its profit .    </S>",
    "<S> this algorithms adopts a distributed approach in which each no autonomously makes its own decisions , and where the best solution arises without the need to synchronize them or to resort to a trusted third party .    </S>",
    "<S> the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through a thorough experimental evaluation considering real - world traffic traces , and a set of realistic scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the results we obtain indicate that our algorithm allows a population of nos to significantly improve their profits thanks to the combination of energy reduction and satisfaction of qos requirements .    maximizing profit in green cellular networks through collaborative games    </S>",
    "<S> * please , cite this paper as : *    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     table  [ tbl : p - heter ] shows the net profit increment @xmath0 for each no @xmath1 . as for the case of homogeneous users , we observe that in scenarios @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the lowest and the highest net profit increases are achieved by no @xmath2 ( i.e. , the no with the heaviest loaded bs ) and no @xmath4 ( i.e. , the no with the lightest loaded bs ) , respectively , while , in scenarios @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the largest net profit increments are reached by the nos that are associated with the highest energy costs ( i.e. , nos @xmath3 and @xmath4 in scenario @xmath4 , and nos @xmath5 and @xmath6 in scenario @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the explanation of this fact is the same given for the homogeneous users case , so we do not repeat it here .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , while the composition of user population has no appreciable effects on the choices taken by individual nos , it has an evident effect on the net profit increase attained by each no . </S>",
    "<S> as can be indeed seen from table  [ tbl : p - heter ] , the @xmath7 values are lower than those achieved by each no in the same scenario when users are homogeneous ( reported in table  [ tbl : p - energy - costs ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is not unexpected , given the lower average revenue rate brought by each user ( @xmath8 $ /hour versus @xmath9 $ /hour ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also note that these increases remain significant .      </S>",
    "<S> the final set of results we comment are concerned with the behavior of the algorithm when the discretization step @xmath11 increases , i.e. , when its frequency of activation decreases . this parameter has an evident impact on the solutions computed by the algorithm , since the larger its value , the coarser the approximation of the load value used to compute the optimal coalition load cost @xmath12 , and the lower the impact of the coalition formation cost @xmath13 .    </S>",
    "<S> to quantify this impact , we run several experiments in which we progressively increase @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> because of space constraints , here we discuss only the results obtained for @xmath14 hours for the same scenarios and user population considered in section  [ sec : enercost ] , that are reported in figure  [ fig : exp - deltat ] . </S>",
    "<S> the figure shows for each value of @xmath11 ( in the @xmath15-axis ) the corresponding @xmath7 values of the various nos ( denoted as @xmath16 , in the @xmath17-axis ) . also , for the sake of comparability , in the same figure , we report the @xmath7 values obtained for @xmath18 hour .     </S>",
    "<S> +     as can be seen from figure  [ fig : exp - deltat ] , the larger @xmath11 , the lower the net profit increase attained by each no for a given scenario with respect to when @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> as previously pointed out for the case of @xmath18 , the energy cost plays an important role in the achieved net profit increments . </S>",
    "<S> this still holds for larger value of @xmath11 since , as can be noted in figure  [ fig : exp - deltat ] , the decrease of the @xmath7 values , for increasing values of @xmath11 , is as much larger as the higher is the energy cost . for instance , this can be observed by comparing the @xmath7 values obtained in scenarios @xmath2 ( see figure  [ fig : exp - deltat_s1 ] ) and @xmath3 ( see figure  [ fig : exp - deltat_s2 ] ) , whereby the electricity cost double . here </S>",
    "<S> , we can note that as @xmath11 increases , the @xmath7 values drops by a factor of about @xmath3 in scenario @xmath2 , and by a factor of nearly @xmath20 but that can reach a factor of about @xmath21 for no @xmath4 , in scenario @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> a similar situation happens in scenarios @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where the nos that experience the higher decrease of their @xmath7 values are the ones with associated the higher electricity cost , namely nos @xmath3 and @xmath4 in scenario @xmath4 ( see figure  [ fig : exp - deltat_s3 ] ) and nos @xmath5 and @xmath6 in scenario @xmath5 ( see figure  [ fig : exp - deltat_s4 ] ) .      from the results obtained in the experimental evaluation we can conclude that :    * energy costs greatly influence the coalition formation and the net profit increments achieved by nos ; * nos with higher energy costs are more motivated to join a coalition since they can offload their users to nos with lower energy costs , thus allowing to switch off their bss and hence to achieve a higher net profit increment ; * nos with heavier load are motivated to join a coalition as well , since they can host users of other nos , thus amortizing their energy costs ; * the composition of user population has no effect on the choices made by the various nos , while  if the revenue associated with each user is directly proportional to its minimum downlink data rate  </S>",
    "<S> it has a strong impact on the net profit increment ; * the discretization step @xmath11 has a significant impact on the coalition formation process , as the larger its value , the lower the net profit increment ; * when choosing the discretization step @xmath11 , one have to also take into account the impact of the energy cost as , the larger is @xmath11 the higher is the ( negative ) impact of the energy cost on the achieved net profit increment . </S>"
