    "[ sec : introduction ]    the polarisabilities of a composite system are among its most basic properties ; see e.g.  @xcite for a recent review . at a classical level , they reflect how much freedom charged constituents have to rearrange under the application of external electromagnetic fields , while in quantum mechanics they indicate how easily electromagnetic interactions induce transitions to low - lying excited states .",
    "they therefore encode information about the symmetries and strengths of constituents interactions with each other and with the photon . as well as the usual electric ( @xmath13 ) and magnetic ( @xmath14 ) polarisabilities , a spin - half object like the nucleon has four  spin - polarisabilities \" ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "these are less obvious in their effects but encode the spin - dependent response and can , for instance , be related to effects analogous to birefringence and faraday rotation for long - wavelength electromagnetic radiation . in the nucleon ,",
    "the lightest relevant excitation involves the creation of a virtual charged pion .",
    "this mechanism is expected to dominate the electric polarisability and contribute significantly to others , too .",
    "the exploration of nucleon polarisabilities was therefore a natural early application of chiral perturbation theory in the baryonic sector  @xcite which predicts the behaviour of each polarisability as it diverges in the chiral limit @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the real world the excitation energy of the @xmath2 resonance , @xmath17 , is about @xmath6 , and thus not very much larger than the physical pion mass .",
    "furthermore , the strong magnetic n@xmath18 dipole transition should give a large paramagnetic contribution to the magnetic polarisability .",
    "the inclusion of the delta as an explicit degree of freedom in chiral effective field theory  @xcite enables quantitative predictions to be made for compton scattering  @xcite .",
    "this eft has recently been used in the most accurate extant determinations of the electric and magnetic polarisabilities of the proton and neutron from compton scattering data  @xcite .",
    "this progress in the theory of polarisabilities is coupled to an upsurge of interest in new experiments that are devoted to obtaining or refining our knowledge of all the polarisabilities , electric , magnetic and spin , of both the proton and neutron  @xcite , with results from maxlab  @xcite and mami  @xcite published within the last year .",
    "the calculation of nucleon polarisabilities directly from the qcd action is also an aim of lattice qcd .",
    "the need to incorporate electromagnetic fields in the computation creates challenges , which means that this is a fairly new endeavour , but several groups now have published results  @xcite . since all are at pion masses substantially above the physical pion mass , the question of how to extrapolate to the real world is of pressing interest , and can be addressed within @xmath0eft .",
    "our analysis provides a bridge between data and lattice qcd , where a direct computation of compton scattering would be highly nontrivial .",
    "polarisabilities are therefore fundamental characteristics of hadrons , and benchmarks for our understanding of hadronic structure ; a summary of their importance and best ways to access them was also provided by a number of theorists in ref .  @xcite . furthermore",
    ", their values have other implications , some examples of which we now discuss .",
    "first , the cottingham sum rule relates the doubly - virtual forward compton scattering amplitude , and hence the proton - neutron difference in @xmath14 , to the proton - neutron electromagnetic mass difference  @xcite .",
    "the relation between the mass difference and the polarisabilities proceeds via a low - energy theorem for the subtraction function in the cottingham formula at vanishing momentum , which is related to @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "when one uses present knowledge on @xmath19 as input and models the subtraction function along the lines suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite , the uncertainty in the polarisability contributes sizeably to the uncertainty in the mass difference .",
    "conversely , assuming knowledge about the electromagnetic part of the mass difference provides a constraint on the polarisabilities  @xcite .",
    "either scenario tests our understanding of the subtle interplay between electromagnetic and strong interactions in a fundamental observable .",
    "second , the magnetic polarisability , @xmath14 , is also crucial for the two - photon - exchange contribution to the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen  @xcite , the least - known ingredient of the `` proton - radius puzzle '' .",
    "the aim of this paper is thus two - fold .",
    "firstly , we will present the analytic expressions and numerical results for all static dipole polarisabilities as they enter in the compton amplitudes used in the recent proton and neutron analyses  @xcite .",
    "there is considerable evidence that the extraction of @xmath20 and @xmath21 from unpolarised compton scattering is robust against variations in the spin polarisabilities  @xcite .",
    "this means that polarisation observables are the best place to determine these latter quantities  @xcite , and programs at mami and hi@xmath22s are engaged in that pursuit  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we use our expressions to predict the running of the polarisabilities with the pion mass , the better to compare with lattice computations at numerically less costly , heavier , pion masses .    in both these contexts",
    ", we pay particular attention to the uncertainties of our predictions and extractions , which are of two types .",
    "the impact of statistical errors on data on @xmath0eftparameters can ultimately be reduced by experimental and non - eft - related efforts . however , there is also a `` truncation error '' which is intrinsic to an eft , and it is that we focus on in this paper . because @xmath0eftgives a perturbative series for all polarisabilities , this truncation error accounts for the fact that we only have computed up to a finite order in the eft expansion  @xcite . without its proper appraisal  and that of any other uncertainties entering the @xmath0eftresult  the significance of any agreement or discrepancy between theory and experiment can not be assessed  @xcite .    on a technical note",
    "we mention here that although polarisabilities are frequency - dependent functions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , this paper is concerned with the static values , that is the limit as @xmath23 .",
    "we will report these in the canonical units of @xmath24 for the scalar polarisabilities , and @xmath25 for the spin ones .",
    "preliminary findings were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and provided for inclusion in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the presentation is organised as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] , we define the chiral power counting in the regimes relevant for lattice computations and summarise the analytic results for the scalar and spin polarisabilities of the proton and neutron . after presenting their values and uncertainties for physical pion masses in sect .",
    "[ sec : values ] , we detail our procedure to assign bayesian degree - of - belief intervals ( sects .",
    "[ sec : theoryerrors ] and  [ sec : finding - theory - uncertainties ] ) and discuss convergence checks .",
    "section  [ sec : extrapolations ] extends this procedure to pion masses above the physical point , provides predictions with error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : allpols ] , and concludes with speculations on the relationship of our findings to the proton - neutron mass splitting and anthropic arguments .",
    "we then compare with available lattice computations in sect .",
    "[ sec : lattice ] , and add conclusions and an appendix .",
    "[ sec : formalism ]      compton scattering on nucleons in @xmath0efthas been reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer the reader for notation and the relevant parts of the chiral lagrangian . here",
    ", we briefly discuss the power counting , which is crucial for our considerations , and sketch the results .",
    "recall that compton scattering exhibits three typical low - energy scales in @xmath0eftwith a dynamical delta : the pion mass @xmath1 as the typical chiral scale ; the delta - nucleon mass splitting @xmath26 ; and the photon energy @xmath27 .",
    "each provides a small , dimensionless expansion parameter when measured in units of a natural `` high '' scale @xmath28 at which the theory is to be expected to break down because new degrees of freedom enter . for static scalar polarisabilities ,",
    "one considers the part of the amplitude which is quadratic in @xmath27 as @xmath23 , and for spin polarisabilities the one cubic in @xmath27 . that leaves two parameters : @xmath29 where for simplicity we take one common breakdown scale @xmath30 for both expansions , consistent with the masses of the @xmath27 and @xmath31 as the next - lightest exchange mesons ; we also count @xmath32 .",
    "this scale is only weakly dependent on @xmath1 , and we will treat it as constant .    the fact that these two expansion parameters have a very different functional dependence on @xmath1 has important consequences for chiral extrapolations .",
    "the delta - nucleon mass splitting depends only weakly on the pion mass , and hence @xmath33 is independent of @xmath1 at the order to which we work . by definition , though , the chiral parameter @xmath34 does change significantly with @xmath1 .",
    "we therefore identify three regimes relevant in contemporary lattice computations , based on the relative size of @xmath35 and @xmath33 .",
    "we stress that regimes are not clearly separated , but transition from one regime to the next is gradual .    in * regime ( i ) * , around the physical pion mass , @xmath36 , we follow pascalutsa and phillips  @xcite and exploit a numerical coincidence to define a single expansion parameter @xmath4 : @xmath37 this is , of course , the regime relevant for the analysis of real - world compton scattering data , and hence this power counting determines the contributions which were included in refs .",
    "@xcite which should be consulted for more details .    as the pion mass increases",
    ", we move into * regime ( ii ) * , @xmath38 . the two expansion parameters are now numerically of comparable size , @xmath39 , but their @xmath1 dependence is still different .",
    "it is then appropriate to identify @xmath40 as the sole expansion parameter  @xcite .    finally in * regime ( iii ) * , @xmath41 , @xmath0eftbecomes inapplicable because the chiral expansion does not converge .",
    "a chiral extrapolation of any observable can be expected to hold qualitatively at best . in sect .",
    "[ sec : lattice ] , we will see that @xmath0eft s polarisabilities agree in the main with extant lattice results at such pion masses , but why this should be so is unclear .",
    "the corresponding uncertainties are certainly impossible to quantify with present techniques .",
    "note that we will not discuss the power counting for very small pion masses , @xmath42 .",
    "this regime near the chiral limit is fascinating , but it will be some time before lattice computations explore it .      here",
    "we bring together the relevant expressions for the various contributions to the polarisabilities : @xmath43n loops ( calculated to subleading order ) , @xmath44 loops , delta pole diagrams , and low - energy constants from the fourth - order @xmath43n lagrangian .",
    "the expressions for the dipole polarisabilities are mostly published , but they are scattered in the literature .",
    "the numerical values of all variables are listed in refs .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "when we cite the expressions for all polarisabilities , we are excluding any  non - structure \" effects which would persist for a point - like nucleon with an anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "for the spin polarisabilities we also exclude the contribution of the @xmath45 pole  @xcite .",
    "these definitions are standard in the literature , except that the backward spin polarisability @xmath46 is often given without subtraction of the pion pole contribution of @xmath47 for the proton / neutron . in terms of the multipole polarisabilities , the forward and backward spin polarisabilities are defined as @xmath48 we work in a heavy - baryon framework , except for the delta pole , whose case is explained shortly . in @xmath4",
    "counting , in regime ( i ) , the leading contribution to the compton scattering amplitudes is the thomson term which is @xmath49 , followed by leading @xmath43n loops which are @xmath50 , then diagrams with a single delta propagator which are @xmath51 , and finally subleading @xmath43n loops and lecs ( counter terms ) at @xmath52 . in two cases ,",
    "our expressions also contain terms which are higher - order in @xmath4 counting .",
    "first , we do not expand the @xmath44 loop expressions in powers of @xmath53 ; this has the advantage that the expression remains valid as we move towards regime ( ii ) @xmath54 . however , we do omit higher - order graphs that are suppressed by @xmath55 relative to the leading ones .",
    "the other exception is that we use a covariant delta propagator for its pole graphs .",
    "since no loops or renormalisation are involved , this is simply a convenient way of accounting for some kinematic higher - order effects , including the electric @xmath22n@xmath18 coupling , which are relevant in the regime @xmath56 . for our present purposes these are not necessary ,",
    "but as they are small at the physical point and do not affect the running with @xmath1 , we retain them for consistency with our previous work @xcite .    before presenting the formulae",
    ", we note a subtlety which arises when one counts polarisabilities rather than amplitudes .",
    "the electric and magnetic polarisabilities @xmath13 and @xmath14 follow the power - counting outlined above ; since in the amplitudes they multiply two powers of @xmath57 , the contributions are @xmath58 from the leading @xmath43n pieces , @xmath59 from delta contributions and @xmath60 from subleading @xmath43n pieces , generating @xmath61 as well as @xmath1-independent contributions .",
    "on the other hand , the spin polarisabilities @xmath15 multiply three powers of @xmath62 and hence start at @xmath63 .",
    "however , there are no contributions at @xmath64 since the delta - nucleon mass difference acts as an infrared cut - off , forbidding delta contributions to diverge in the chiral limit . instead",
    ", the delta contributions start at @xmath65 , and these , together with the subleading pion loops which are @xmath58 , form the next non - zero contribution to the ( isoscalar ) spin polarisabilities .",
    "this has consequences for our error estimates , which are more reliable for @xmath13 and @xmath14 where we have three nonzero terms in the @xmath4 expansion series , than they are for the @xmath15 where there are only two . in either case ,",
    "the last contribution calculated is of order @xmath66 relative to leading .",
    "the leading - order ( lo ) contributions from the pion cloud around the nucleon , fig .",
    "[ fig : lopin ] , were first calculated by bernard , kaiser and meiner  @xcite : @xmath67 as motivated above , they diverge in the chiral limit and are indeed @xmath68 for the scalar polarisabilities , and @xmath69 for the spin ones .    for future reference",
    "we note that the @xmath45-pole contributes @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the third pauli matrix in isospin space .",

    "@xcite adapted the approach to efts .",
    "other methods for estimating the truncation error are certainly possible , but this bayesian framework has the advantage that it allows clear specification of premises : it facilitates a rigorous derivation of the theoretical uncertainties from a particular assumption about the behaviour of higher - order coefficients in the eft series .",
    "note that we work in the leading - omitted - term approximation , i.e.  we assume the error associated with that term dominates the theoretical uncertainty . as long as @xmath0eftis convergent , this is a reasonable assumption ( cf .",

    "@xcite .",
    "we want to understand how to interpret such a truncation error .",
    "to do that , we compute the probability distribution function ( pdf ) , denoted @xmath168 , namely the degree of belief that a polarisability will take a specific value which differs by an amount @xmath169 from the calculated central value @xmath170 of the @xmath0eftprediction at order @xmath162 .",

    "this is a bayesian approach , a choice of prior for the coefficients @xmath173 associated with the higher - order terms is mandatory .",
    "we implement a prior which assigns uniform probability to any value of the omitted coefficients , up to some unspecified maximum , as for prior @xmath174 of ref .",
    "these assumptions lead to analytic expressions for the probability distribution : @xmath175 for @xmath176 , these pdfs are illustrated for in fig .",
    "[ fig : combinedpdfs ] . by integration of the pdf ,",
    "we define @xmath177 such that @xmath178 $ ] is the 68% dob interval .",
    "this is also how we define the theoretical or truncation error in eqs .   and , and throughout this work .",
    "for comparison , the standard eft error estimate , @xmath179 $ ] , is a @xmath180% dob interval . for two of the cases we are concerned with , namely  @xmath181 and @xmath182 , these are @xmath183 and @xmath184 intervals , respectively , so there is little difference between @xmath185 and @xmath177 .",
    "we close with a few comments .",
    "first , the truncation uncertainty is not distributed in a gauian way .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "each time a new order is calculated , more information is gleaned about the largest - possible coefficient in the series .",
    "that the probability is equidistributed for any value inside the standard eft interval between zero and @xmath186 is inherited from our choice of prior .",
    "on the other hand , the probability of finding a coefficient larger than the maximum of those obtained thus far becomes smaller the more orders are known  a fact represented by the steeper power - law falloff above the maximum as the eft calculation s order increases . indeed , the @xmath187 dob interval of the pdf in eq .",
    "is not twice as large as the @xmath5% interval @xmath177 , as would be expected for a gauian pdf ; see also the examples in fig .",
    "[ fig : combinedpdfs ] below .",
    "instead , it lies at about @xmath188 for @xmath189 , @xmath190 for @xmath181 , and @xmath191 for @xmath182 .",
    "second , in cases where we know that one of the @xmath166 is _ a priori _ zero , e.g.  by symmetry arguments , since the power - law falloff of the pdf outside the `` standard '' eft interval is determined by the number of non - trivial orders computed , the value of @xmath162 to be used in eq .",
    "must then be reduced by one .",
    "different interpretations of the naturalness of eft coefficients are encoded in different priors , and those in turn can produce somewhat different 68% dob intervals . in ref .",
    "@xcite , several possibilities for the naturalness prior were considered and it was demonstrated that  once three orders in the eft series are known  those different interpretations of naturalness led to a 1015% variation in the truncation error . however , the variation is larger if fewer coefficients in the series have been computed , as then the specific form of the prior plays more of a role in determining the final error .",
    "furthermore , our invocation of the first - omitted - term approximation means that our error bands have a fractional uncertainty that could be as large as @xmath192 , although the actual impact of terms beyond the ( first omitted ) @xmath193 term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : errorestimate ] ) depends on whether coefficients at order @xmath162 and beyond are correlated , uncorrelated , or anti - correlated  @xcite .",
    "regardless , this suggests that the truncation error computed here should be understood to itself have an accuracy of @xmath194% .",
    "the errors quoted below should be read with this in mind . for uniformity of presentation , we quote all errors to one decimal place , but in certain instances this may constitute spurious precision .      the values of the spin polarisabilities at @xmath195 and @xmath117 are given in table  [ tab : convergence ] .",
    "the first order is isoscalar , while the next one contains both isoscalar and isovector components .",
    "the series for the isoscalar spin polarisabilities is therefore computed to an accuracy of @xmath181 nonzero orders ; the contribution of order @xmath196 relative to lo is zero , and so we know only @xmath164 and @xmath197 in eq .  .",
    "we hence obtain the results for the isoscalar remainder @xmath185 from eq .   shown in table  [ tab : convergence ] . in practice",
    "@xmath197 is the larger coefficient in each case , and so @xmath198 is @xmath4 times the @xmath199 contribution . comparing with eq .   for @xmath181",
    ", we find that this remainder can be interpreted as a @xmath200% dob interval .",
    "for the isovector spin polarisabilities we only have one order , and so @xmath198 is @xmath4 times the total and the corresponding dob interval is only @xmath201% .

    "[ fig : combinedpdfs ] shows , this smears out the individual pdfs considerably so that they look somewhat more gauian .",
    "results are the same for the proton and neutron .",

    "the solid ( dashed ) grey line denotes the 68% ( 95% ) dob interval .",
    "pdfs for all polarisabilities are available in the appendix.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in all cases , simply adding isoscalar and isovector errors linearly yields ranges that are near - identical to the 68% dob intervals .",
    "one could also choose to study proton and neutron convergence patterns separately , instead of those of the isoscalar and isovector quantities .",
    "in general this produces somewhat smaller errors ; it never gives larger ones .",
    "for example , the proton uncertainty of @xmath202 would be about equally large , while that for the neutron would be quite a bit smaller ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "whether one uses the proton - neutron or the isospin basis is a question of choice .",
    "we take the latter because its error assessments are more conservative and because @xmath0eftis most naturally formulated in the isospin basis .",
    "we now turn to @xmath92 since its expansion is more complicated . as mentioned above , it is , strictly speaking , not a free parameter at the order to which we work , but in practice its proton value was obtained from a fit to unpolarised proton data .",
    "this requires the promotion of a lec from the fifth - order @xmath43n lagrangian .",
    "a further complication is that its delta - pole contribution of @xmath227 , which is nominally suppressed by @xmath66 , is more than twice the lo contribution .",
    "the contribution of @xmath44 loops is tiny .",
    "the origin of this , of course , is the large size of the magnetic @xmath22n@xmath18 coupling @xmath99 , whose square enters the leading pole contribution for @xmath92 but not the other spin polarisabilities ( see eq .  ) . as a result ,",
    "the pole contribution is about @xmath228 times as large as if @xmath99 were of natural size .",
    "there is precedent for promoting terms involving coefficients which are unnaturally large , see e.g.  @xcite , and hence for @xmath92 we treat the @xmath229 contribution to the delta pole as suppressed by only one power of @xmath4 , giving @xmath182 nontrivial orders in our expansion .",
    "the calculation is still complete to n@xmath3lo as any other graphs involving @xmath229 will be suppressed by @xmath230 ; thus only the error estimate is affected by the reordering . with neither of these adjustments",
    ", we would predict the proton value to be @xmath231 , which is in fact still compatible with our quoted result of @xmath232 .",
    "however several lines of evidence , though not conclusive , suggest the latter is a more appropriate central value and uncertainty ; these include the close similarity of the values in the third and fourth - order extractions of the scalar polarisabilities discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as the dr and mami values quoted in table  [ tab : spinpols ] .",
    "finally , the forward and backward spin polarisabilities of eq .   are not independent of the multipole spin polarisabilities .",
    "their errors could thus be assessed naively as @xmath233 by adding the individual multipole errors in quadrature , if the individual errors were gauian distributed .",
    "since both also inherit the large delta - pole contribution as well as the fitted lec from @xmath92 , we instead assess their theoretical uncertainties by the same prescription as for @xmath92 . as both are linear combinations of quantities which are sensitive to different multipolarities , and hence different physical mechanisms , _ a priori _ we expect the two errors to be similar .",
    "surprisingly , we find an error of @xmath46 that is half that of @xmath156 .",
    "we see no physical reason for this . furthermore , when in sect .",
    "[ sec : errorregimei ] , we look at values of @xmath1 greater than the physical value , the difference between the @xmath156 and @xmath46 errors disappears for @xmath234 .",
    "this suggests that the rather small uncertainty for @xmath46 found via the order - by - order prescription at @xmath79 is accidental .",
    "therefore , for all @xmath1 , we will use as the error of @xmath46 that derived by bayesian criteria for @xmath156 .",
    "the resulting @xmath148 uncertainty of @xmath235 at @xmath79 is then close to the added - in - quadrature result .",
    "we close with remarks which pertain to scalar polarisabilities ; further discussion can be found in sect .",

    "our previously - published uncertainties of eq .   were also obtained by considering order - by - order convergence , though without the rigorous framework provided here . for the proton ,",

    "these are within the quoted uncertainties .    in each case , the changes quoted for @xmath92 do not take into account the fact that it needs to be refitted once such effects are added ; we expect this to decrease the magnitude of higher - order effects .",

    "hence , we choose a value of @xmath4 which increases with @xmath1 , @xmath262 for the three spin polarisabilities which are pure predictions , @xmath202 , @xmath115 and @xmath203 , there is little more be said .",
    "as at the physical point , at any given @xmath1 we derive the isoscalar and isovector uncertainties from the order - by - order convergence of their respective series , and obtain the total uncertainty by convoluting the corresponding pdfs .",
    "the overall scale of their isoscalar uncertainty @xmath263 turns out to be dominated by @xmath4 times the @xmath264 contribution at all pion masses we consider . in each case , the absolute error increases rather modestly as a function of @xmath1 , mainly because an important part of the @xmath264 contribution is actually falling as @xmath265 while the expansion parameter @xmath266 grows linearly .",
    "the ordering of contributions to @xmath92 , @xmath156 and @xmath46 for @xmath267 also mirrors exactly that at the physical point as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : finding - theory - uncertainties ] : terms quadratic in the rather large coupling @xmath229 are promoted by one order .",
    "the scalar polarisabilities require a little more discussion , since we did not derive in detail their errors at the physical point , these having been determined through fits to data  @xcite .",
    "first , we recall that the fit of @xmath106 and @xmath107 to deuteron data used amplitudes only at nlo , while that for the proton used those at one order higher .",
    "this leads to substantially larger truncation errors at the physical point than that for the proton : @xmath268 as opposed to @xmath269 . however , their running with @xmath1 is predicted in @xmath0eftto n@xmath3lo for both .",
    "thus , when generating the scalar - polarisability error bands in the neutron case , we use the same uncertainties as for the proton , while including the larger truncation uncertainty in the error bar at the physical point . once again , any change in the central value of @xmath106 and @xmath107 resulting from a new fit to deuteron data at order @xmath66 rather than @xmath196 relative to lo only serves to move the curve up and down . a construction of isoscalar and isovector uncertainties as for the spin - polarisabilities , with reasonable assumptions as to how much @xmath270 may shift in an future n@xmath3lo fit , produces near - identical bands .",
    "furthermore , in the proton fits of ref .",
    "@xcite , the actual fit parameter was @xmath271 , with @xmath272 fixed by the baldin sum rule .",
    "the scale @xmath273 of the uncertainty was obtained by considering @xmath271 as _ predicted _ at lo@xmath117and _ fit _ at the next two orders . by fitting the amplitudes at nlo ,",

    "however , the baldin sum rule for @xmath279 is special : at the physical point it provides extrinsic information in our nlo and n@xmath3lo fits and should be reproduced exactly .",
    "in fact , higher - order effects in the scalar - polarisability sum for the proton at the physical point are tiny compared to the lo prediction of @xmath280 from eq .  .",
    "we therefore base our error estimates for @xmath272 beyond the physical point only on the shifts from the lo term , i.e.  we drop @xmath164 in the construction of @xmath185 in eq .  ; we then have @xmath181 for @xmath272 .",

    "( see e.g.  @xcite ) can then only be reconciled with @xmath0eftthrough ever - increasing fine - tuning between terms of different , higher orders . in the case of the lattice polarisabilities for @xmath363 , such pion - mass - independence is more akin to that expected in a heavy - constituent - quark model , or in the classical lorentz model which considers heavy , charged particles in a harmonic - oscillator potential .",
    "indeed , this smooth @xmath1-evolution might be considered generic .",
    "of course , qcd must provide a smooth interpolation between the chiral and heavy - quark regimes ; cf .",
    "@xcite for the case of baryon masses .",
    "it is plausible that results like ours , with weak @xmath1-dependence at low chiral orders and large pion masses , provide reasonable extrapolations into the regime in which @xmath0eftis _ a priori _ inapplicable .",
    "such a `` principle of chiral persistence '' suggests that our chiral extrapolations for the spin polarisabilities may turn out to match future lattice computations at high pion masses , too .",
    "if such  chiral persistence \" is not a feature of qcd , then those computations will reveal the agreement seen thus far to indeed be accidental .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ]    in this paper , we have presented the static scalar and spin dipole polarisabilities of both the proton and neutron in @xmath0eftas a function of the pion mass .",
    "we have included the leading and sub - leading effects of the nucleon s pion cloud , together with the leading contributions of the @xmath2 and its pion cloud .",
    "we have differentiated between two pion - mass regimes .",
    "close to the physical @xmath1 , our results are complete at second order in the small expansion parameter @xmath364 .",
    "this corresponds to three non - vanishing orders for the scalar polarisabilities and two for the spin polarisabilities . for @xmath289 , however , the results are complete only at leading order since contributions are reordered : leading @xmath43n , @xmath2 and @xmath44 effects are all of similar size .    a central goal of the paper is to provide reproducible estimates of uncertainties from within the @xmath0eftframework which are as objective as feasible . at each pion mass , we have used a recently developed statistical interpretation of standard order - by - order eft convergence estimates to derive @xmath288 degree - of - belief intervals .",
    "the resulting probability distributions are non - gauian .",
    "they are based on several assumptions : the error associated with the first omitted term in the @xmath0eftseries dominates the uncertainty ; the corresponding eft coefficient is `` natural '' in units of the breakdown scale ; and the size of this first omitted term grows linearly with @xmath1 .",
    "the inclusion of select higher - order effects indicates that for pion masses below about @xmath284 our uncertainties are , if anything , overestimated .",
    "in fact , basic physical arguments imply that our truncation - error for @xmath279 is markedly too large for @xmath356 , so we somewhat arbitrarily assign zero truncation error to it .",
    "truncation errors must be combined with uncertainties in the input parameters , like the error on @xmath285 from the baldin sum rule .",
    "a framework that combines all these errors in a statistically consistent way is under development  @xcite .    at the physical pion mass ,",
    "the truncation errors of the spin polarisabilities augment our previously published prediction of the central values , and our recent fits of the scalar polarisabilities . in all cases ,",
    "the bayesian method provides a rigorous theory error .",
    "our spin polarisabilities agree well , within their errors , with available extractions from data , and with the predictions of both dispersion relations and a formulation of @xmath0eftwith relativistic baryons .    for the neutron electric polarisability and @xmath348 , agreement between our @xmath0eftpredictions and extant lattice computations at @xmath365 mev",
    "is remarkably good . beyond this pion mass",
    ", there are doubts about the convergence of @xmath0eft , and the error bars we derived are certainly not trustworthy .",
    "nevertheless , if we extrapolate the central value of our @xmath0eftcurves into this regime , agreement persists for lattice results on both @xmath106 and @xmath20 at @xmath366 mev  within the uncertainties on the lattice numbers .",
    "taking such an extrapolation for the isovector magnetic polarisability out to @xmath367 mev yields striking agreement with the recent results of ref .",
    "this is surprising , given that @xmath0eftis certainly not convergent at such a large pion mass .",
    "we speculate that such an extrapolation of the @xmath0eftcurve does better than we have any right to expect , because  at the order to which we work  the pion - mass dependence is tame enough to permit smooth evolution into the functional dependence of a constituent - quark model .    while most of the present lattice results are at too high a pion mass to be reliably extrapolated to the physical point , they still corroborate important aspects of our findings .",
    "a cancellation between @xmath43n loops and short - distance mechanisms encoded in lecs makes the magnetic scalar and spin polarisabilities small at @xmath79 , but this cancellation does not persist away from the physical point .",
    "similar fine - tuning leads to a physical - world proton - neutron difference that , for both the scalar electric and magnetic polarisabilities , is consistent with zero within present uncertainties . both of these proton - neutron degeneracies are lifted away from the physical point . in the near future , lattice calculations could examine the onset of these cancellations as @xmath1 is lowered towards , and even below , @xmath284 .",
    "we pointed out that @xmath304 may have a previously - neglected impact on the variation of the proton - neutron mass difference with the quark mass .",
    "the critical role of the neutron lifetime in big - bang nucleosynthesis then suggests an anthropic argument may explain what otherwise appears to be a coincidentally small value of @xmath304 .    finally , we look forward to a next - order calculation of the polarisabilities in @xmath0eft .",
    "this includes subleading effects of the pion cloud around the delta .",
    "the associated lecs in the @xmath0eftwith an explicit @xmath2 are , in principle , constrained by data from other processes , e.g.  @xmath43n scattering and pion photoproduction .",
    "but in practice , their values have non - negligible uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "still , such an @xmath368 calculation could yield more accurate predictions at the physical point , in particular for spin polarisabilities and isovector parts .",
    "it may also allow a better assessment of the convergence of the chiral series for @xmath289 , where only leading - order accuracy is available at present .",
    "this project was prompted by a request from a.  alexandru .",
    "we are indebted to him and to m.  lujan for discussions and encouragement ; to m.  savage for well - timed advice , crucial inspiration , and sharing findings of the nplqcd collaboration prior to publication ; and to s.  beane for discussions on the behaviour of low - energy quantities outside the chiral regime .",
    "we also gratefully acknowledge correspondence with a.  alexandru , m.  engelhardt and b.  tiburzi concerning details of their respective lattice computations , and with m.  hoferichter and h.  leutwyler on the impact of @xmath304 on the proton - neutron mass difference .",

    "<S> we examine the results of chiral effective field theory ( @xmath0eft ) for the scalar- and spin - dipole polarisabilities of the proton and neutron , both for the physical pion mass and as a function of @xmath1 . </S>",

    "<S> we include both the leading and sub - leading effects of the nucleon s pion cloud , as well as the leading ones of the @xmath2 resonance and its pion cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the analytic results are complete at n@xmath3lo in the @xmath4-counting for pion masses close to the physical value , and at leading order for pion masses similar to the delta - nucleon mass splitting . in order to quantify the truncation error of our predictions and fits as @xmath5% degree - of - belief intervals </S>",
    "<S> , we use a bayesian procedure recently adapted to eft expansions . at the physical point , our predictions for the spin polarisabilities are , within respective errors , in good agreement with alternative extractions using experiments and dispersion - relation theory . at larger pion masses </S>",
    "<S> we find that the chiral expansion of all polarisabilities becomes intrinsically unreliable as @xmath1 approaches about @xmath6as has already been seen in other observables . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0eftalso predicts a substantial isospin splitting above the physical point for both the electric and magnetic scalar polarisabilities ; and we speculate on the impact this has on the stability of nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> our results agree very well with emerging lattice computations in the realm where @xmath0eftconverges . </S>",
    "<S> curiously , for the central values of some of our predictions , this agreement persists to much higher pion masses . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate on whether this might be more than a fortuitous coincidence .    </S>",
