    "recently , magnetism and superconductivity of rare - earth and actinide compounds have attracted renewed attention in the research field of condensed matter physics @xcite . in particular , filled skutterudites , expressed as rt@xmath4x@xmath5 with rare - earth atom r , transition metal atom t , and pnictogen x , provide us a platform for systematic research of magnetism and superconductivity of @xmath6-electron systems with @xmath7@xmath82 @xcite , where @xmath7 denotes the number of @xmath0 electrons .",
    "since rt@xmath4x@xmath5 crystallizes in the cubic structure with high symmetry of @xmath9 point group @xcite , orbital degeneracy remains in general .",
    "due to the strong spin - orbit coupling in @xmath0 electrons , spin - orbital complex degrees of freedom , i.e. , @xmath10 , become active in filled skutterudites .",
    "for instance , a second - order phase transition at 6.5k in prfe@xmath4p@xmath5 @xcite has been considered to be due to antiferro quadrupole ordering @xcite .",
    "note that a possibility of antiferro hexadecapole order has been also suggested in prfe@xmath4p@xmath5 @xcite . in ndfe@xmath4p@xmath5 ,",
    "a significant role of quadrupole at low temperatures has been suggested from the measurement of elastic constant @xcite .",
    "a possibility of octupole ordering in smru@xmath4p@xmath5 has been also pointed out from the elastic constant measurement @xcite .",
    "note that the octupole scenario in smru@xmath4p@xmath5 has been supported by muon spin relaxation @xcite and @xmath11p nmr experiments @xcite .",
    "quite recently , a possibility of antiferro hexadecapole order has been proposed to understand metal - insulator transition of prru@xmath4p@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "another characteristic issue of filled skutterudites is @xmath12 , i.e. , anharmonic vibrations of rare - earth atom around the off - center position inside the pnictogen cage .",
    "effects of rattling on low - temperature @xmath0-electron states have been recently discussed actively , in particular , with relevance to magnetically robust heavy - fermion phenomenon observed in smos@xmath4sb@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "concerning the symmetry of vibrations , a possibility of degenerate @xmath3 mode has been suggested in pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "since there exists linear coupling between @xmath0 electrons in degenerate @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) orbitals and vibration mode with @xmath3 symmetry , the present author has pointed out quasi - kondo phenomenon due to dynamical jahn - teller ( jt ) phonons @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the case of @xmath7=3 as typical example to study low - temperature multipole properties and the effect of jt phonons on the multipole state of filled skutterudites .",
    "the multiorbital anderson model constructed based on a @xmath13-@xmath13 coupling scheme is analyzed by a numerical renormalization group method .",
    "note that the multipole state is determined by the maximization of the multipole susceptibility .",
    "it is found that the primary multipole state is characterized by the mixture of 4u magnetic and 5u octupole moments , while the secondary state is specified by 2u octupole .",
    "when we further include the coupling between @xmath0 electrons and jt phonons , we find that quadrupole fluctuations are significant at low temperatures in the 4u-5u coupled multipole state . finally , we briefly discuss possible relevance of our results to actual nd - based filled skutterudite compounds .",
    "the local @xmath0-electron state is described by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the annihilation operator for @xmath0 electrons with spin @xmath16 and angular momentum @xmath17(=@xmath18,@xmath19,3 ) , @xmath16=+1 ( @xmath201 ) for up ( down ) spin , @xmath21 is the crystalline electric field ( cef ) potential for angular momentum @xmath22=3 , @xmath23 is the kronecker s delta , and @xmath24 is the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the matrix element @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 and zero for the other cases .",
    "the coulomb integral @xmath27 is expressed by the combination of four slater - condon parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 @xcite . in this paper , we set @xmath28=10 , @xmath29=5 , @xmath30=3 , and @xmath31=1 in the unit of ev . for the @xmath9 point group ,",
    "@xmath21 is given by three cef parameters , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "in the traditional notations @xcite , they are expressed as @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 specify the cef scheme for @xmath9 point group , while @xmath38 determines an energy scale for the cef potential .",
    "the local hamiltonian @xmath39 can provide us exact information on local @xmath0-electron states , irrespective of the values of coulomb interactions and spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "however , since @xmath39 includes seven orbitals , we are immediately faced with difficulties for further study of many - body phenomena in @xmath0-electron systems .",
    "thus , it is natural to consider the effective model which describes well low - energy states of @xmath39 . for the purpose ,",
    "we have proposed to exploit a @xmath13-@xmath13 coupling scheme @xcite .",
    "we set the spin - orbit coupling term as an unperturbed part , while the cef potential and coulomb interaction terms as perturbations .",

    "( [ heff ] ) is given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is expressed by three racah parameters , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , which are related to the slater - condon parameters .",
    "explicit expressions of @xmath53 by using @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are shown in ref .",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , @xmath54 is the correction term in the order of @xmath55 .",
    "details on this term have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . here , three comments are in order .",
    "( i ) effects of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are included as two - body potentials in @xmath56 .",
    "( ii ) the lowest - order energy of @xmath56 is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 denotes the original hund s rule interaction among @xmath0 electrons .",
    "( iii ) the parameter space in which @xmath59 works is determined by the conditions for the weak cef , i.e. , @xmath60@xmath611 and @xmath57@xmath61@xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath52 is the effective hund s rule interaction in the @xmath13-@xmath13 coupling scheme , estimated as @xmath52@xmath62@xmath63 @xcite , we obtain @xmath64@xmath610.02 .",
    "thus , it is allowed to use @xmath59 even for @xmath24 in the order of 0.1 ev @xcite , when @xmath65 is set as a realistic value in the order of @xmath66 ev for actual @xmath0-electron materials .",
    "now we consider the hybridization between @xmath0 and conduction electrons . from the band - structure calculations ,",
    "it has been revealed that the main conduction band of filled skutterudites is @xmath67 with xyz symmetry @xcite , which is hybridized with @xmath0 electrons in the @xmath68 state with @xmath67 symmetry . in order to specify the @xmath0-electron state ,",
    "we introduce `` orbital '' index which distinguishes three kinds of the kramers doublets , two @xmath69 and one @xmath68 . here `` a '' and `` b '' denote the two @xmath69 s and `` c '' indicates the @xmath68 .",
    "then , the multiorbital anderson model is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the dispersion of @xmath67 conduction electrons with @xmath68 symmetry , @xmath72 is the annihilation operator of @xmath0 electrons on the impurity site with pseudospin @xmath16 and orbital @xmath73 , @xmath74 is the annihilation operator for conduction electrons with momentum @xmath75 and pseudo - spin @xmath16 , and @xmath76 is the hybridization between conduction and @xmath0 electrons with @xmath67 symmetry . throughout this paper",
    ", we set @xmath76=0.05 ev .",
    "note that the energy unit of @xmath77 is half of the bandwidth of the conduction band , which is considered to be in the order of 1 ev , since the bandwidth has been typically estimated as 2.7 ev for prru@xmath4p@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "thus , the energy unit of @xmath77 is taken as ev . to set the local @xmath0-electron number as @xmath7=3 , we adjust the @xmath0-electron chemical potential .    the last term in eq .  ( [ ham ] )",
    "denotes the electron - phonon coupling . here",
    ", the effect of @xmath3 rattling is included as relative vibration of surrounding atoms .",
    "we remark that localized @xmath69 orbitals with @xmath2 symmetry have linear coupling with jt phonons with @xmath3 symmetry , since the symmetric representation of @xmath2@xmath78@xmath2 includes @xmath3 .",
    "then , @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the electron - phonon coupling constant , @xmath82 and @xmath83 are normal coordinates for @xmath84- and @xmath85-type jt phonons , respectively , @xmath86 and @xmath87 are corresponding canonical momenta , @xmath88= @xmath89 , @xmath90= @xmath91 , @xmath92 is the frequency of local jt phonons , and @xmath93 indicates the cubic anharmonicity .",
    "note that the reduced mass of jt modes is set as unity . here",
    "we introduce non - dimensional electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath94 and the anharmonic energy @xmath95 as @xmath94=@xmath96 and @xmath95=@xmath97 , respectively .",
    "in order to clarify the magnetic properties at low temperatures , we usually discuss the magnetic susceptibility , but in more general , it is necessary to consider the susceptibility of multipole moments such as dipole , quadrupole , and octupole .",
    "the multipole operator is given in the second - quantized form as @xmath98 where @xmath99 denotes the symbol of multipole with the symmetry of @xmath100 and @xmath73 indicates a set of indices for the irreducible representation . for @xmath13=5/2 , we can define multipole operators up to rank 5 in general , but we are primarily interested in multipole properties from the @xmath69 quartet .",
    "thus , we consider multipole moments up to rank 3 in @xmath101 symmetry .",
    "now we show explicit forms of multipole operators @xcite . as for dipole moments with @xmath102 symmetry ,",
    "the operators are expressed as @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 are three angular momentum operators for @xmath13=5/2 , respectively .",
    "concerning quadrupole moments , they are classified into @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "we express the @xmath107 quadrupole operators as @xmath109 for the @xmath108 quadrupole , we have the three operators @xmath110 where the bar denotes the operation of taking all possible permutations in terms of cartesian components .",
    "octupole moments are classified into three types as @xmath111 , @xmath102 , and @xmath112 . among them , @xmath111 octupole is written as @xmath113 for the @xmath102 octupole , we express the operators as @xmath114 while @xmath112 octupole operators are given by @xmath115 note that we redefine the multipole moments so as to satisfy the orthonormal condition tr@xmath116=@xmath117 @xcite .    in principle",
    ", the multipole susceptibility can be evaluated in the linear response theory @xcite , but we should note that the multipole moments belonging to the same symmetry can be mixed . in order to determine the coefficient of such a mixed multipole moment , it is necessary to find the optimized multipole state which maximizes the susceptibility .",
    "namely , we define the multipole operator as @xmath118 where the coefficient @xmath119 is determined by the eigenstate with the maximum eigenvalue of the susceptibility matrix , given by @xmath120 here @xmath121 is the eigenenergy for the @xmath7-th eigenstate @xmath122 , @xmath123 is a temperature , and @xmath124 is the partition function given by @xmath124=@xmath125 .    in order to evaluate @xmath126 as well as an entropy @xmath127 and a specific heat @xmath128 of @xmath0 electrons",
    ", we resort to the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method @xcite , in which momentum space is logarithmically discretized to include efficiently the conduction electrons near the fermi energy . in actual calculations ,",
    "we introduce a cut - off @xmath129 for the logarithmic discretization of the conduction band . due to the limitation of computer resources , we keep @xmath17 low - energy states . in this paper",
    ", we set @xmath129=5 and @xmath17=3000 .",
    "note that the temperature @xmath123 is defined as @xmath123=@xmath130 in the nrg calculation , where @xmath131 is the number of the renormalization step .",
    "the phonon basis for each jt mode is truncated at a finite number @xmath132 , which is set as @xmath132=20 in this paper .",
    "first let us discuss the cef states on the basis of @xmath59 . in figs .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) , we show the cef energy levels for @xmath7=2 and 3 , respectively . here",
    "we set @xmath24=0.1 ev , @xmath38=@xmath133@xmath78@xmath66 ev , and @xmath37=0.3 .",
    "since the effects of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are included in @xmath59 as two - body potentials , @xmath59 can reproduce well the cef energy levels of the local hamiltonian @xmath77 in the realistic intermediate coupling region with @xmath134 in the order of 0.1 . as for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite .    in order to determine the value of @xmath36 for",
    "nd - based filled skutterudites , here we recall that in pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 , the ground state is @xmath135 singlet and the excited state is @xmath136 triplet with small excitation energy as large as 10 k @xcite .",
    "such a situation is well reproduced by choosing @xmath36=0.4 for @xmath7=2 in fig .",
    "now we change rare - earth ion from pr@xmath137 ( @xmath7=2 ) to nd@xmath137 ( @xmath7=3 ) . in principle , it is not necessary to modify the cef parameters even if rare - earth ion is changed , since the cef potential is given by the sum of electrostatic potentials from ligand anions .",
    "note , however , that the cef potentials may be changed due to the substitution of t and/or x in rt@xmath4x@xmath5 .    when we set @xmath36=0.4 for @xmath7=3 in fig .",
    "1(b ) , it is observed that the ground state for @xmath7=3 at @xmath36=0.4 is @xmath69 quartet and the first excited state is @xmath68 doublet with the excitation energy of 0.02 ev .",
    "experiments for ndos@xmath4sb@xmath5 have suggested @xmath69 ground and @xmath68 excited states with the excitation energy of 220k @xcite . it should be remarked that the theoretical cef energy levels for @xmath7=3 agree well with experimental results for ndos@xmath4sb@xmath5 , by using the cef parameters deduced from the cef energy levels for pros@xmath4sb@xmath5 .",
    "we note that in ndfe@xmath4p@xmath5 , both the ground and first excited states have been found to be @xmath69 quartet with the excitation energy of 222 k @xcite .",
    "however , in any case , the ground state quartet is well separated from the first excited state both for ndos@xmath4sb@xmath5 and ndfe@xmath4p@xmath5 .",
    "in such a situation , it is considered that low - temperature multipole properties are not sensitive to the first excited state .",
    "thus , in the following discussion , we fix @xmath36=0.4 .    for the purpose to understand the cef energy levels of ndfe@xmath4p@xmath5 ,",
    "it is necessary to consider first those of prfe@xmath4p@xmath5 .",

    "now we proceed to the nrg results of @xmath77 .",
    "first let us consider the case without the coupling between @xmath0 electrons and jt phonons . in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we show the multipole susceptibility @xmath138 .",
    "the dominant multipole moment in the low - temperature region is the mixture of 4u magnetic and 5u octupole , given by @xmath139 where we find that @xmath140=@xmath141 , @xmath142=@xmath143 , and @xmath144=@xmath145 for @xmath146=@xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath147 .",
    "the mixture of 4u and 5u moments is characteristic of @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "in fact , when we calculate the multipole susceptibility for @xmath101 symmetry ( @xmath37=0 ) using the same parameters except for @xmath37 , we actually find that @xmath144=0 .",
    "it is one of important features of filled skutterudites with @xmath9 symmetry that 4u magnetic moment is accompanied with 5u octupole .",
    "note that the magnitude of @xmath144 depends on parameters .",
    "the secondary multipole state is given by 2u octupole .",
    "we also find another mixture of 4u magnetic and 5u octupole moments , with reduced magnitude of susceptibility . in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we show entropy and specific heat . at low temperatures , there remains an entropy of @xmath148 , originating from localized @xmath69 quartet , since we consider the hybridization between @xmath67 conduction band and @xmath68 state .",
    "in actuality , there should exist a finite hybridization between @xmath2 conduction bands and @xmath69 states , even if the value is not large compared with that between @xmath67 conduction and @xmath68 electrons .",
    "thus , the entropy of @xmath148 should be eventually released .     and ( b ) @xmath127 and @xmath128 vs. temperature for @xmath7=3 without jt phonons . ]",
    "next we include the effect of dynamical jt phonons , but before proceeding to the numerical results , let us consider intuitively what happens . in the @xmath13-@xmath13 coupling picture , we accommodate three electrons into the one - electron levels with @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "note that @xmath68 is lower than @xmath69 , since the ground state of @xmath7=2 is @xmath135 singlet , which is mainly composed of doubly occupied @xmath68 .",
    "when we accommodate one more electron , it should be put into @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the @xmath69 quartet ground state is obtained .",
    "intuitively , the 4-fold degeneracy is understood by the combination of spin and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "here we consider the jt potential in the adiabatic approximation . note that in actuality , the potential is not static , but it dynamically changes to follow the electron motion . for @xmath95=0 , the potential is continuously degenerate along the circle of the bottom of the mexican - hat potential .",
    "thus , we obtain double degeneracy in the vibronic state concerning the rotational jt modes along clockwise and anti - clockwise directions .",
    "when a temperature becomes lower than a characteristic energy @xmath149 , which is related to a time scale to turn the direction of rotational jt modes , the entropy of @xmath150 should be eventually released , leading to kondo - like behavior @xcite , since the specific rotational direction disappears due to the average over the long enough time .    ,",

    "<S> the secondary state is specified by 2u octupole . </S>",
    "<S> when we further take into account the coupling between @xmath0 electrons in degenerate @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) orbitals and dynamical jahn - teller phonons with @xmath3 symmetry , quadrupole fluctuations become significant at low temperatures in the mixed multipole state with 4u magnetic and 5u octupole moments . </S>",
