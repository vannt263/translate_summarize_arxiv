    "the differing properties of galaxies in high- and low - density regions indicate that there is a tug - of - war between the influence of internal processes and external factors on galaxy evolution , depending on the surroundings @xcite . in the higher density environment",
    ", galaxies are subjected to external effects such as interactions or mergers which seem frequent and universal in the densely populated system , leading to enhanced star formation activity compared to field galaxies @xcite . in addition",
    ", major mergers can deform the morphology of a galaxy @xcite causing a higher fraction of early - type galaxies in high - density environments @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the galaxies in less dense regions , like field galaxies , are thought to have experienced a relatively small number of mergers .",
    "this low merger rate helps internal processes become significant because internal secular evolution , such as the formation of galactic bars and spiral structures , is too slow and fragile to be sustained against violent major mergers @xcite .",
    "some studies , in this less harsh environment , found that early - type galaxies are observed to be less massive and relatively younger @xcite , and late - type galaxies prefer to have some internally developed features such as a pseudo - bulge @xcite , confirming the differing evolution of galaxies in low - density regions .",
    "an isolated galaxy is considered as an object which has not been considerably perturbed by its neighbors for a few gyr @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the context of the local environment effect , many studies of isolated galaxies have been conducted in the last few decades @xcite .",
    "one of the well known studies is the analysis of the interstellar medium of isolated galaxies ( amiga ) project whose galaxies are based on the catalogue of isolated galaxies ( cig ; * ? ? ?",
    "the amiga project refined the cig for morphologies of 1,050 isolated galaxies @xcite using the second palomar observatory sky survey ( poss ii ) .",
    "the degree of isolation was also quantified @xcite using the digitized poss ( dposs i and ii ) . in a series of studies , the amiga project dealt with multiwavelength properties of isolated galaxies including photometric characteristics @xcite , the star formation rate derived from h@xmath2 emission @xcite , the fir luminosity function @xcite , radio continuum properties @xcite and the nuclear activity using fir , radio and optical databases @xcite .    in defining an isolated galaxy ,",
    "the isolation criteria devised by @xcite , or variations on this theme , are widely used in studies including amiga projects .",
    "@xcite only took into account a relative apparent size and a projected distance between the target galaxy and potential neighbors , due to the deficit of redshift information at that time .",
    "but the photometric isolation scheme can miss some isolated galaxies by regarding background objects as potential companions @xcite .",
    "in addition to this , tidal perturbation strength can be considered as a criterion of isolation @xcite .",
    "the tidal perturbation strength helps to quantify the tidal influence of the companions based on spatial separations and stellar mass ratio between the target galaxy and companions .",
    "for example , if external tidal forces are greater than 1% of the internal binding force , the galaxy can be thought to be perturbed by neighbors @xcite .",
    "however , the external influence may not be instantaneous but continuous , so accumulated effects during the transit time of neighboring galaxies should be considered to better understand the effects of perturbers .",
    "statistical studies of isolated galaxies using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been reported @xcite .",
    "many of them are based on the criteria developed by @xcite , and only focused on providing a catalog of isolated galaxies or testing the cig criteria .    in this paper , we constructed a catalog of isolated galaxies using the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 ; * ? ? ? * ) to present the properties of isolated galaxies along the hubble morphological type . for the isolation criteria",
    ", we took into account the distance in three dimensional space to reduce the impact of projection effects .",
    "we did not use the tidal perturbation strength , but instead rely on a strict distance criterion . in section  [ sec : sample ] , we present our sample selection criteria for isolated galaxies and comparison sample galaxies . in section  [ sec :",
    "basic ] , we describe the morphologcal classification scheme and photometric properties of isolated galaxies . the characteristics of absorption lines with a stellar population model and the properties of emission lines are addressed in sections  [ sec : absorption ] and  [ sec : emission ] , respectively . in section",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we discuss the evolutionary scenario of isolated galaxies compared to comparison galaxies and possible biases in the sampling .",
    "we present our conclusions and summarize our results in section  [ sec : summary ] . throughout this work ,",
    "we have assumed the following cosmological parameters : h@xmath3 = 70 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath5 = 0.3 and @xmath6 = 0.7 .",
    "to study isolated galaxies , we make two kinds of samples : isolated galaxies without any companions , and a comparison sample of galaxies in denser regions .",
    "the parent sample consists of the main galaxy sample @xcite of the sdss dr7 which covers one quarter of the sky using a 2.5 m telescope in apache point , new mexico @xcite .",
    "we focus on the nearby galaxies ( @xmath7 ) so as to include more faint galaxies when we measure the galaxy density in our volume - limited sample .",
    "this redshift range also helps us to secure relatively robust visual morphological classification while minimizing the evolution effect , as described by @xcite .",
    "the main galaxy sample is comprised of galaxies with spectroscopic information and most of them are at @xmath8 .",
    "the sample is designed to be complete for galaxies with @xmath9 in spectroscopy .",
    "however , galaxies with low surface brightness or galaxies which are too bright in apparent fiber magnitudes are not targeted for the spectroscopic survey @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some galaxies in crowded fields can be missed due to the fiber collisions @xcite .",
    "therefore , before defining isolated galaxies , we test the spectroscopic completeness for each field of our galaxies . the spectroscopic completeness of each field is estimated by calculating the percentage of galaxies with spectra among galaxies in the luminosity range of @xmath10 , a projected 2 mpc radius around our target galaxy . 2 mpc is our criterion of isolation ( see below ) .",
    "since the spectroscopic completeness declines for bright galaxies , we set the minimum @xmath11-band magnitude to be 13.0 which guarantees at least 70% of the spectroscopic completeness @xcite .",
    "we have found that only about 10% of galaxies in @xmath7 ( with the mean completeness of 89% ) have the completeness less than 70% and they are removed at this stage .",
    "the isolated galaxies and the comparison group galaxies used in our study are selected based on a volume - limited sample ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this magnitude cut roughly corresponds to a stellar mass of @xmath13 .",
    "after the volume limitation , we have 38,011 galaxies .    for this volume - limited sample",
    ", we measure the density of each galaxy by counting the number of companion galaxies within a sphere in three dimensional space . in estimating a distance between galaxies using the redshift",
    ", the distance could be overestimated due to proper motions of field galaxies ( @xmath14190 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , misclassifying some galaxies to be isolated . in other studies , an elongated cylinder with 0.5 or 1 mpc radius",
    "is considered to compensate for the effect of the proper motion in selecting isolated galaxies @xcite . since we define isolated galaxies based on a sphere instead of a cylinder , a 2 mpc distance criterion in redshift space , which is a strict condition ,",
    "is chosen .",
    "this 2 mpc criterion can help companion galaxies to be separated from the target galaxy by at least 1 mpc in `` real '' space .",
    "for example , in the worst case scenario , the target and companion galaxy are aligned along the line of sight .",
    "we take the case that the galaxies appear separated by 2 mpc in redshift space , but in fact the companion galaxy has a proper motion of 190 .",
    "we calculate that if we vary the direction of the proper motion of the companion randomly , the companion will have a true separation from the target galaxy greater than 1 mpc , 70% of the time ( prob = @xmath15 = @xmath16 = 0.7 ) .",
    "as this is a worst case scenario , we can expect our 2 mpc criterion to guarantee at least a 1 mpc true separation in most cases .    to choose the comparison galaxies as the `` typical '' galaxies according to the hierarchical formation scenario , we select the comparison galaxies when there are at least two companion galaxies in a 1 mpc sphere under the consideration of the finger - of - god effect @xcite .",
    "a typical system in the comparison sample is similar to the local group  the milky way has two companion galaxies within 1 mpc , m31 and m33 .",
    "when we account for companion galaxies , the mass ratio between the target galaxy and companion galaxies varies depending on the mass of the target galaxy . for example , massive galaxies can have a large range of mass ratio .",
    "meanwhile , for galaxies near the magnitude limit ( @xmath17 ) , only galaxies with comparable mass can be considered as companion galaxies . in other words ,",
    "our definition of isolation could permit some `` isolated galaxies '' to have companion galaxies with comparable mass below the magnitude cut off .",
    "to minimize this inhomogeneity in the sampling , we select galaxies with @xmath18 ( 1 magnitude brighter than the magnitude limit ) .",
    "this ensures companions can be detected near the magnitude limit down to mass ratio of @xmath141:3 ( the mass limit of target galaxies is @xmath14@xmath19 @xmath20 and that of companion galaxies is @xmath14@xmath21 @xmath20 ) . with this choice ,",
    "the number of isolated galaxies and comparison sample galaxies are 3,969 and 4,591 , respectively .",
    "to examine the surroundings of our galaxies , it is helpful to visualize the spatial distribution of the galaxies . figure  [ fig : spatial ] shows a column density map with isolated and comparison sample galaxies .",
    "we measure the gaussian weighted density of galaxies for our volume - limited sample ( 38,011 ) @xcite :    @xmath22    @xmath23 is the angular distance and @xmath24 is the distance along the line of sight .",
    "@xmath25 is introduced to compensate for the finger - of - god effect .",
    "we choose @xmath26 to be 3 mpc to present long - range densities .",
    "the darker shading indicates the higher long - range density and isolated and comparison sample galaxies are shown in blue and red symbols , respectively .",
    "a significant fracton of the volume is empty space ( voids ) .",
    "relatively denser regions form filamentary structures .",
    "most of comparison sample galaxies seem to reside in the vicinity of the high - density region .",
    "meanwhile , isolated galaxies are widely distributed from relatively less dense regions to higher density areas @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the definition of isolated galaxies in our sample is with respect to the local density , rather than the global environment .",
    "it is interesting to compare our galaxies with void galaxies which are regarded as galaxies in very low - density regions . for a void catalog",
    ", we adopted the catalog provided by @xcite .",
    "@xcite tried to identify voids in sdss dr 7 using a void finder @xmath27 which is based on the voronoi tessellation .",
    "the @xmath27 algorithm is liable to include the surrounding high - density walls of the void @xcite . therefore , to avoid including the galaxies in void walls , we only select the members located in the central regions of voids by using smaller effective size of voids than the given value , i.e. 0.8r@xmath28 . as a result , we find 59 voids in our sampling volume with a median radius of 7 mpc , and @xmath143% of isolated galaxies and @xmath144% of comparison galaxies are in voids",
    ". comparable numbers of void galaxies in the isolated and comparison sample indicates that the void galaxies can be either isolated or coupled .",
    "also , a small number of void galaxies in our sample implies that void galaxies are in `` globally '' low - density regions while our isolated galaxies are in `` locally '' low - density areas .",
    "thus the isolated galaxies can be expected to show properties caused by local environments , rather than global ones .",
    "it is hard to classify the morphology of galaxies that appear small or edge - on .",
    "thus , we take advantage of the criteria used in @xcite to remove apparently small or low isob@xmath29/isoa@xmath29 objects among isolated and comparison sample galaxies : isoa@xmath29 @xmath30 30@xmath31 or isob@xmath29/isoa@xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath320.01 isoa@xmath29 + 0.90 . here , isoa@xmath29 and isob@xmath29 from the sdss photometric pipeline are the isophotal radius in @xmath11-band along the major - axis and minor - axis , respectively . to test the criteria",
    ", we also perform a morphological classification using a randomly selected 500 galaxies from our sample , and confirm that these demarcation lines separate the classifiable and non - classifiable objects well .",
    "this step removes about 30% of galaxies , leaving 2,660 isolated galaxies and 3,409 comparison sample galaxies for a visual inspection .",
    "when we exclude the galaxies which can not satisfy the criteria , some galaxies with intrinsically low isob@xmath29/isoa@xmath29 like e6 and e7 are ruled out , making a bias against them .",
    "therefore , we will not address such galaxies in our study .",
    "3 @xmath33 composite color images with different scales , and one gray scale image from the sdss are used in the visual inspection .",
    "the field - of - view of the 3 colored images are 50 , 70 and 100 kpc .",
    "we classify the morphology as elliptical , lenticular , unbarred spiral , barred spiral and irregular galaxy following the hubble sequence @xcite .",
    "galaxies which can not be placed in a specific class are categorized as `` unknown '' type galaxies .",
    "we did not consider other revised versions of hubble types such as classifications used in third reference catalog of bright galaxies ( rc3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to keep simplicity .",
    "the morphology classification strategy we use is similar to the classification method described in @xcite .",
    "here is a brief description of the scheme .    1 .",
    "we classify a galaxy as an elliptical galaxy when it is a spheroidal dominant system without any distinct disk or clumpy features .",
    "elliptical galaxies are divided into subclasses depending on the projected ellipticity defined as @xmath34 = 1@xmath32isob@xmath29/isoa@xmath29 .",
    "these subclasses are only derived from the projected shape and thus may not be highly indicative of the true shapes @xcite .",
    "lenticular galaxies are bulge dominant but also have a disk feature . with the exception of the presence of a disk , the properties of lenticular galaxies are similar to those of elliptical galaxies , making it hard to distinguish between them @xcite",
    ". however lenticular galaxies can be distinguished by a less concentrated and extended light distributions compared to elliptical galaxies .",
    "the most distinct feature of spiral galaxies is the presence of spiral arms . among the spiral galaxies , early - type spiral galaxies such as sa or sba",
    "have tightly wound spiral arms and a relatively large bulge . from s(b)a to s(b)d , spiral arms are wound less tightly and the bulge becomes less dominant .",
    "furthermore , the presence or absence of a bar is also an important characteristics of spiral galaxies . by using the gray scale images with sharper contrast",
    ", we try to minimize the bias caused by weak bars , which are difficult to identify due to their low luminosity and short length @xcite .",
    "4 .   irregular galaxies have a wide variety of forms . in general , they show weak spiral arm features and a very small bulge ( or maybe bulgeless ) , and are rather asymmetric .",
    "galaxies in the unknown class are the most difficult to define",
    ". the majority of them may be lenticular galaxies which tend to be confused with elliptical galaxies , as mentioned above .",
    "many small ( though brighter than our limit ) galaxies , without any distinct feature , were difficult to classify and thus placed into the unknown category .",
    "very faint galaxies , with few striking features , and also galaxies that are disturbed by tidal interactions or mergers , are also included in the unknown category .         ",
    "[ tab : catalogfour].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      by excluding unknown galaxies from each sample , our sample has 1,644 isolated galaxies and 1,994 comparison sample members .",
    "the similarity in size of the two samples makes our statistical analysis straightforward .",
    "figure  [ fig : fraction ] shows the distribution of morphology fraction along the hubble sequence .",
    "the fraction of isolated galaxies and comparison sample galaxies are presented in gray and white bars , respectively .",
    "e@xmath35 indicates the aggregates of subclasses of elliptical galaxies ( e0e5 ) .",
    "early - type galaxies are more common in the comparison samples .",
    "this is in agreement with the well - known morphology - density relation that high density environments are rich in elliptical galaxies , while low density regions are spiral - rich @xcite .",
    "specifically , elliptical galaxies are more abundant in the comparison samples than in isolated galaxies by a factor of 3 ( 28.6% of comparison sample and 9.9% of isolated galaxies ) .",
    "since the work of @xcite , it is generally accepted that a merger of two disk galaxies can result in the formation of an elliptical galaxy @xcite .",
    "therefore , assuming the merger rate is proportional to the density of the environment , it is natural that the fraction of elliptical galaxies is higher in the comparison sample .",
    "we must note , however , that the comparison sample galaxies are in diverse environments spanning from a small galaxy group to a large galaxy cluster . in a group environment , fly - by tidal interactions and mergers may occur frequently @xcite . on the other hand , in the cluster environment ,",
    "mergers are unlikely to occur due to the fast relative motion of galaxies within the deep gravitational potential well of the cluster @xcite .",
    "interestingly , deep optical observations show the frequency of the merger features in clusters is almost comparable to that in the field @xcite .",
    "this contradiction seems to be explained by the merger relics scenario suggested by @xcite . in this scenario , galaxies with merger features flow into the cluster , having experienced their merger events outside the cluster environment . while complexities exist ,",
    "it is probably natural to assume that today s dense regions were assembled by smaller density peaks in the earlier universe where mergers were frequent .    in both samples , slightly oval shaped galaxies such as e2 or e3 are greatest in abundance and this abundance decreases as galaxies become rounder or flatter , confirming the result of @xcite . according to @xcite , luminous elliptical galaxies are likely to be triaxial and less luminous elliptical galaxies are usually oblate .",
    "however , we can not find any prominent distinction between the two samples .",
    "it is probably because our classification scheme does nt reflect their intrinsic shapes , but merely the projected ones .",

    "this trend is the same in barred spiral galaxies .",
    "furthermore , for the isolated galaxy sample , there is a steady increase in number as we move from sa to sc galaxies , which is consistent with other studies @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", comparison sample galaxies do not show such an increasing trend from sa to sc type .",
    "this implies that the evolutionary histories of spiral galaxies in the isolated systems and relatively denser regions may be different .",
    "the mechanism for bar formation is debatable .",
    "the bar structures can be formed through either a secular evolution @xcite or during a tidal interaction with another galaxy @xcite .",
    "thus , it is interesting to compare the bar fractions @xmath36 of the two samples in different density regions .",
    "@xcite reported that the bar fraction in the clusters is comparable to that of field galaxies at lower redshift , whereas @xcite found no environmental preference .",
    "furthermore , @xcite found the fraction of barred galaxies are not influenced by the nearest neighbor galaxy if the separation between galaxies is larger than 0.1 times the virial radius of the neighbor . on the other hand , @xcite claims that bars are more frequently found in perturbed late - type galaxies than in isolated ones by a factor of 2 .",
    "we found that 18.7% and 18.1% of spiral galaxies are barred spiral galaxies in the isolated system and comparison sample , respectively / isoa@xmath37 0.7 as used in @xcite for example , the bar fraction increases up to 23.8% and 25.1% for isolated and comparison sample galaxies , respectively .",

    "we acknowledge this systematic uncertainty , and we thus focus only on the difference between isolated and comparison samples . ] .",
    "this result indicates that there is no significant difference in the bar fraction as a function of density in our sample .",
    "while we admit that our environmental criterion is not comprehensive , one may be tempted to interpret this result as evidence against the environmental scenario for the bar formation .",
    "the concentration index is widely regarded as a tool for morphology classification @xcite .",
    "since we classified the morphologies of galaxies using a visual inspection , the concentration index can be used as a validity check for our classification .",
    "there are several distinct definitions of concentration index , but here we use the ratio between petror90 and petror50 of the @xmath11-band petrosian magnitude , i.e. c@xmath29 @xmath38 petror90/petror50 . figure  [ fig : cr ] shows c@xmath29 values on the hubble tuning fork .",

    ", we use measurements of absorption lines given by the ossy catalog @xcite to study stellar populations .",
    "the ossy catalog , based on the lick / ids system resolution , provides the strength of absorption lines which are measured taking into consideration for the emission line subtraction using the @xmath51 fit tool .",

    "the format is the same as that of figure  [ fig : cr].,scaledwidth=50.0% ]      the strength of absorption lines are generally affected by temperature and metallicity . among the absorption lines , balmer absorption line indices are sensitive to the temperature , and strongest around an effective temperature of 10,000 k ( a - type stars ) .",
    "therefore , an old stellar population which has a relatively low temperature shows a weak balmer absorption line in general @xcite . for the analysis of balmer absorption line , we use the h@xmath1 absorption line .",
    "equivalent width ( ew ) values of the h@xmath1 absorption line are shown in figure  [ fig : hb ] .",
    "the h@xmath1 absorption line strength of early - type galaxies is lower than that of late - type galaxies @xcite , indicating that the stellar component of early - type galaxies is older , as expected .",
    "also , in late - type galaxies , the median ew of h@xmath1 absorption line becomes larger along the hubble sequence for both isolated and comparison sample galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the idea that more late - type spiral galaxies are more gas rich , with a higher star formation rate ( sfr ) , and thus relatively younger .",
    "although the median ew of the h@xmath1 absorption line index in isolated elliptical galaxies ( 1.83@xmath59  ) is slightly larger than that of elliptical galaxies in the comparison sample ( 1.75@xmath60  ) and this trend happens for all subclasses of elliptical galaxies , the differences are not notable . for spiral galaxies , they do nt show any prominent difference .",

    "massive galaxies are expected to be more metal rich , as observed in the well - known mass  metallicity relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to study the metallicity , we chose the fe5270 absorption line index as a representative metal line which is a typical fe indicator used in the stellar population model @xcite .    figure  [ fig : fe5270 ] shows , for both isolated and comparison samples , early - type galaxies have larger ew values of the fe5270 absorption line than late - type galaxies do .",
    "this can be inferred from the fact that early - type galaxies are more massive than late - type galaxies ( figure  [ fig : mass ] ) resulting in higher metallicity . furthermore , late - type galaxies have descending trends of the fe5270 line strength from s(b)a to s(b)d , regardless of the density environment , and this can also be understood in terms of the mass - metallicity relation . like h@xmath1 , there is a small difference of fe5270 line strength between isolated and comparison sample galaxies , for both elliptical and spiral galaxies , but it is not significant enough to compare their metallicity without consideration of the degeneracy of age and metallicity .",

    ", they quickly spread @xmath2-elements , their main product , into the interstellar medium .",
    "meanwhile , type ia supernovae whose generation is delayed , but relatively continuous throughout the period of star formation , supply predominantly fe - peak elements @xcite .",
    "thus , by comparing the abundance of @xmath2-elements and fe , [ @xmath2/fe ] , we can trace the star formation history of galaxies @xcite .",
    "the mgb absorption line is widely used to represent the abundance of @xmath2-elements .",

    "also among late - type galaxies , the strength decreases from s(b)a to s(b)d for both isolated and comparison sample galaxies ( figure  [ fig : mgb ] ) .",
    "this result implies that the early - type galaxies experience a relatively intensive star formation activity , while the late - type galaxies have an extended star formation history .    for elliptical galaxies ,",

    "as we discussed above , absorption line strengths are affected by both age and metallicity , the so called ` age  metallicity degeneracy ' @xcite .",

    "this means that there are larger amounts of accumulated star formation in isolated galaxies during the last few gyr and therefore , the isolated elliptical galaxies would be measured to be younger than the comparison sample in luminosity - weighted age .",
    "the results are compatible with those from the absorption - line analysis  that isolated elliptical galaxies appear younger than their counterparts while spiral galaxies in the isolated and comparison samples have similar luminosity - weighted ages for a given morphology . in this interpretation , the tendency in the luminosity - weighted ages of galaxies , at least in the local universe , may be viewed as a galaxy mass effect rather than environmental effect @xcite .    ) , b ( @xmath85 ) , c ( applying the cut in @xcite ) and d ( excluding the unknown type ) histograms are for different samples .",
    "see the text for details.,scaledwidth=43.0% ]      in this section , we discuss possible bias that could affect our works .",
    "the situations where bias could be introduced are the following :    case 1 : :    the selection of the galaxies with @xmath85    from the volume - limited sample ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "case 2 : :    the use of the criteria in @xcite .",
    "case 3 : :    the classification of morphology into the unknown class during the    visual inspection .",
    "figure  [ fig : bias ] shows the distribution of the stellar mass for isolated ( upper panel ) and comparison sample galaxies ( lower panel ) .",
    "different histogram styles indicate different samples .",
    "the dotted - line open histogram ( a ) is for the sample with @xmath86 .",
    "the dashed - line open histogram ( b ) is for the sample with @xmath85 .",
    "the filled histogram ( c ) is for the sample after applying the cut in @xcite .",
    "the hatched histogram ( d ) is for the sample after excluding the unknown class through the visual inspection .",
    "the overall distributions of the comparison sample are slightly shifted toward high mass compared to those of isolated galaxies . some low - mass isolated ( or comparison ) galaxies in the dotted - line open histogram ( a )",
    "would be misclassified because of the inhomogeneous sampling ( see section  [ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "case 1 causes sample a to change to sample b , case 2 is from sample b to c , and case 3 is from sample c to d.    since sd - type spiral galaxies have the lowest mass among spiral galaxies , they are likely to be abundant at @xmath87 @xmath88 . in case 1 ,",
    "most galaxies with a mass range of @xmath14@xmath21@xmath89 @xmath88 are missed , so many sd - type galaxies would be removed , only leaving a small number of massive sd - type galaxies .",
    "in addition , among sc - type galaxies , the galaxies with low mass would also be removed due to its median stellar mass being close to @xmath89 @xmath88 .",
    "this would make sc - type spiral galaxies biased toward massive ones . in case 2 ,",
    "the small and apparently flat galaxies are likely to be excluded .",
    "thus , there is a chance that sb - type and sc - type spirals , as well as e6 and e7 elliptical galaxies , are missed . as discussed in section  [ sec : morph ] , s0 galaxies are not easy to classify and thus , s0 galaxies and complex sa - type and elliptical galaxies would account for a large fraction of the unknown class in our study ( section  [ sec : morph_compare ] ) .",
    "as a result , some galaxies with the mass range of @xmath14@xmath89@xmath90 @xmath88 can be excluded in case 3 , and some late - type spiral galaxies are missed .",
    "hence , through case 1 , 2 and 3 , spiral galaxies seem to be affected not only in number fraction but in stellar mass , whereas elliptical galaxies with mass @xmath91 @xmath88 are less affected . to summarize ,",
    "although we have found that spiral galaxies are rich in isolated galaxies ( figure  [ fig : fraction ] ) , the fraction of spiral galaxies would be underestimated due to the sampling bias .",
    "the stellar mass in spiral galaxies could be somewhat biased toward massive galaxies in figure  [ fig : mass ] , but this occurs to a lesser degree in elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have used 1,644 isolated galaxies and 1,994 comparison galaxies , drawn from the sdss dr7 , in the redshift range of @xmath7 , to investigate the properties of isolated galaxies along the hubble morphological types .",
    "our study focuses on not only photometric properties , but also spectroscopic characteristics of isolated galaxies , with the help of the ossy catalog which provides accurate line measurements .",
    "the main results of this study can be summarized as follows .    1 .   to study isolated galaxies , we construct the isolated galaxy sample and its comparison group based on the number of companion galaxies .",
    "we define the galaxies without any companion galaxy within a 2 mpc sphere as isolated galaxies and those with at least two companions within 1 mpc as comparison sample galaxies . by choosing galaxies with @xmath85 from our volume - limited sample ,",
    "we ensure we can detect companions down to a mass ratio of @xmath141:3 for our faintest galaxies .",
    "this choice provides us with comparable numbers of galaxies between the isolated and comparison sample .",
    "isolated galaxies are distributed widely and even located in high - density ( by long - range density measurement ) regions , whereas comparison galaxies are mainly positioned in high - density areas .",
    "we have also found that there are a small number of void galaxies in our isolated galaxy sample as well as in the comparison set .",
    "this implies that the isolated galaxies in our study are primarily influenced by the local density environment , rather than the global one .",
    "morphologies of the two samples are classified through a visual inspection and the fractions along the hubble sequence of isolated and comparison galaxies show different distributions .",
    "only 21.2% of isolated galaxies are early type whereas 46.7% are early type in the comparison sample . naturally , spiral galaxies are much more common in isolated systems ( 77.6% ) than in comparison ones ( 52.5% ) .",
    "this result is consistent with the morphology - density relation @xcite .",
    "subclasses ( e0e5 ) of elliptical galaxies in the two samples have similar distributions , because we do not consider the intrinsic shapes .",
    "the fractions of barred spiral galaxies seem similar regardless of the density of the environment .",
    "elliptical galaxies of both isolated and comparison galaxies form the red sequence on the color - magnitude diagram , but , on the whole , isolated ones ( @xmath45 ) appear fainter than their comparisons ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "unbarred spiral galaxies of both samples are in the blue cloud and overall distributions are similar .",
    "barred spiral galaxies show bimodal distributions without any distinct difference between the isolated and comparison samples .",
    "5 .   for elliptical galaxies",
    ", there is a discrepancy in stellar mass between the isolated and comparison sample galaxies .",
    "the median of the stellar mass in isolated elliptical galaxies ( @xmath50 ) is lower than that of their comparisons ( @xmath49 ) by 50% . on the other hand ,",
    "spiral galaxies do not show any significant difference in their stellar mass between the two samples _ within subclasses_. the same trends are observed in the distributions of their velocity dispersion .",
    "the median absorption line strengths including h@xmath1 , fe5270 and mgb between isolated galaxies and their comparisons are similar for all morphological types .",
    "we used the tmj stellar population model @xcite which can help to break the degeneracy between the age and metallicity of a galaxy .",
    "elliptical galaxies show a discrepancy between isolated and comparison galaxies in the median luminosity - weighted age by 20% and there is no obvious distinction in the median luminosity - weighted metallicity or [ @xmath2/fe ] .",
    "spiral galaxies in the two samples do not show any significant difference in properties of stellar populations .",
    "we have not found any significant difference in emission - line properties between isolated and comparison samples that can be explained in a straightforward way .",
    "we constructed a sample of isolated galaxies following conventional approaches based on local density .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that isolated galaxies do not show much difference in observable properties , but this is largely supported by the current hierarchical prediction .",
    "it seems that the `` isolated '' galaxies defined this way are not an extreme population of galaxies after all , as long as they are part of the same large scale structures .",

    "<S> isolated galaxies are dominantly late type with the morphology distribution ( e : s0 : s : irr ) = ( 9.9 : 11.3 : 77.6 : 1.2)% . the frequency of elliptical galaxies among isolated galaxies is only a third of that of the comparison sample . </S>",
    "<S> most of the photometric and spectroscopic properties are surprisingly similar between isolated and comparison samples . however , early - type isolated galaxies are less massive by 50% and younger ( by h@xmath1 ) by 20% than their counterparts in the comparison sample . </S>",
