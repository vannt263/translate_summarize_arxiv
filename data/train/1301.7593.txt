    "the green functions of a general quantum field theory contain in principle all the information of the theory .",
    "consequently , since a few decades , considerable research effort is being devoted to construct as reliable as possible estimates of these green functions in qcd .",
    "the main motivation for this has been to get some understanding about the infrared properties of qcd ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) , but they have been also aimed at extracting low - energy parameters as @xmath4 from lattice qcd computations ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in particular , gluon and ghost propagators have been recently computed , within the etm collaboration , from lattice gauge fields including @xmath0=2 + 1 + 1 , two light degenerate and two heavy , dynamical quark flavours ( see  @xcite for details of the simulations set - up ) with a twisted - mass fermion action  @xcite . those propagators were first exploited for the calculation of the @xmath5 strong running coupling _ via _ the taylor - scheme coupling in landau gauge  @xcite and , more recently , with pure yang - mills ( no flavours ) and two - light - flavours propagators , all together studied in order to investigate the effects on them from dynamical quark flavours  @xcite . the running coupling estimated through these propagators with @xmath0=2 +",
    "1 + 1 at @xmath6 and @xmath7 mass scales has been proven to agree pretty well with experimental results from @xmath6 decays  @xcite and `` _ world average _ '' from pdg  @xcite . in the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite , the invocation of nonperturbative ope corrections is unequivocally needed to account properly for the lattice data of the coupling in the taylor scheme .",
    "the ope approach allows for the expansion of the matrix element of any non - local operator in terms of local operators , that can be conveniently organized in a hierarchy by their momentum dimensions .",
    "then , the terms of that ope expansion for any green function provide with nonperturbative corrections that , after the sum rules factorization  @xcite , appear coded as a coefficient to be computed in perturbation ( wilson coefficient ) and the nonperturbative condensate of a local operator .",
    "furthermore , a consistent ope picture implies that , with the proper renormalization of the local operators , their condensates should be `` universal '' and take the same value in the ope expansion for any different green function . in refs .",
    "@xcite ( also in refs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0=0 and @xmath82 quark flavours ) , the taylor - scheme running coupling is confronted to its ope prediction to leave us with a best fit of both @xmath4 and the dominant nonperturbative condensate , _",
    "i.e. _ that of the local operator @xmath1 which has been elsewhere very much studied ( _ e.g. _ , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth to emphasize that , in constructing the taylor - scheme coupling , the bare lattice propagators appear combined such that the cut - off dependence must disappear and any correction depending on the lattice spacing hence will vanish when approaching the continuum limit  @xcite .",
    "this makes easier the confrontation of lattice data and continuum predictions but prevents the check for the universality of condensates , as gluon and ghost propagators are not to be independently analyzed . on the other hand ,",
    "concerning the universality of condensates , previous studies exploiting quenched ( @xmath0=0 )  @xcite lattice gauge configurations have shown a fair consistency for the values of this dimension - two gluon condensate extracted from the dominant nonperturbative corrections for gluon , ghost and quark propagators and the three - gluon vertex , in landau gauge .",
    "the same have been found when comparing the condensate extracted from lattice quark propagator and the taylor coupling with @xmath0=2 dynamical flavours  @xcite . still , despite that consistency and the pretty convincing estimate of @xmath4 obtained with the good agreement of the ope formula and the lattice results for the taylor coupling with @xmath82 + 1 + 1 ,",
    "the nature itself of the unavoidable nonperturbative corrections and the involved condensates is a controversial matter ( there was , for instance , some recent controversial work about the notion of condensates that can be followed in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .    in the present note",
    ", we will make one more step with respect to refs .",
    "@xcite and will face any controversy about the nonperturbative ope approach only by following that `` _ the proof of the pudding is in the eating _ '' .",
    "then , our goal here will be to test again the validity of the ope approach , now describing gluon and ghost propagators computed in landau gauge from realistic lattice simulations including non - degenerated strange and charm quarks ( @xmath0=2 + 1 + 1 ) . the running with momenta for both propagators",
    "is well known at the four - loop level from perturbation theory . as one deals with a very realistic simulation of qcd at the energy scale for the @xmath6 physics , @xmath4",
    "will be taken as an input from experiments with @xmath6 decays .",
    "therefore , the deviation with respect to the perturbative running for the lattice propagators will be accurately isolated and identified to the leading ope power correction .",
    "this will allow for a very precise comparison that will be sensitive to the running with momenta of the wilson coefficient for the local operator @xmath1 , which is known at @xmath2 order .",
    "thus , the deviation from the perturbation theory for gluon and ghost lattice propagators will be accurately accommodated within a nonperturbative ope correction , including the running of the wilson coefficient , by fitting a value of the condensate for each propagator and verifying that they both agree .",
    "_ this is a double and very demanding check_.    the paper is organized as follows : the nonperturbative running formulae for the propagators , after properly defining the renormalization prescription , are derived in section [ sec : ope ] ; the results are compared with their lattice estimates in section [ sec : ghgl ] ; the taylor coupling is again obtained from bare gluon and ghost propagators and , for the sake of consistency , compared with the nonperturbative prediction in section [ sec : taylor ] ; and the conclusions are finally presented in section [ sec : conclu ]",
    "the purpose of this section is to derive the running of the propagators including an ope contribution dominated by the local dimension - two operator @xmath1 . in particular",
    ", we focus on the precise definition of the renormalization prescription and in obtaining the wilson coefficients at @xmath2 order .",
    "we will first compute the ope - based equations for both gluon and ghost propagators and then combine them to derive the expression describing the nonperturbative running for the taylor coupling .      for the sake of generality , let us invoke a bare scalar form factor , @xmath10 , defined from any gauge - dependent two - point green function , where @xmath11 is a regularization parameter and @xmath12 the momentum scale .",
    "we can formally write the following ope expansion : [ eq : gammab ] ( p^2 , )  =  ^pert(p^2 , )   ( 1 +  +  )  , which is taken to be dominated in landau gauge by the local operator @xmath1 and where the purely perturbative contribution is explicitly factorized . the bracket in r.h.s .",
    "of must be finite for a renormalizable theory , as the same multiplicative renormalization constant is required to remove on a same footing all the the terms in the ope expansion .",
    "furthermore , one can apply the dimensional regularization procedure ( this implies @xmath13 ) and then , for dimensional reasons , the term proportional to @xmath14 can not produce an additional pole at @xmath15 in a renormalizable theory .",
    "therefore , the poles for the obviously divergent quantity inside the bracket [ eq : ratio ] and those coming from the condensate @xmath16 kill each other . in other words , when dealing with the uv divergencies , one can renormalize the ratio of as follows [ eq : ren ] z_a^2(^ 2,^-1 )   , where the dimension - two local operator is renormalized by @xmath17 such that a^2 _ r,^ 2  =  z_a^2 ^ -1(^2,^-1 )  a^2 _ ^-1   and we prescribe the standard @xmath5 renormalization recipe that only @xmath18-poles and accompanying factors @xmath19 are to be dropped away .",
    "stands for the definition of @xmath20 , in the `` wilson @xmath5 '' scheme , while the expanded green function is in @xmath21 scheme . ]",
    "( @xmath5 )  @xcite , after the introduction of [ eq : c0mom ] c_0^(p^2,^2 )  =   , which allows to recast that now will read [ eq : gammar1 ] ( p^2,^-1 )  =  ^pert(p^2,^-1 )   ( 1 +   +  )  .",
    "thus , one can immediately notice that the renormalization of the wilson coefficient inside the bracket and that of the two - point green function outside are independent processes , irrespective with each other .",
    "in particular , one can also prescribe the standard @xmath5 renormalization scheme for the two - point green function and will obtain the following helpful relation : [ eq : c2s ] c_2^(,(^2 ) ) c_0^(,(^2 ) )  ; that will allow for a direct link of @xmath20 to the standard @xmath5 wilson coefficient computed at @xmath22-order in @xcite .",
    "for the purposes we pursue , the running with momentum , @xmath23 , for the ope nonperturbative correction inside the bracket of can be derived by solving the following renormalization group ( rg ) equation [ eq : rge ] \\ { -_a^2^((^2 ) ) + + ( ( ^2 ) ) }   =  0  , with [ eq : gammaa2 ] _",
    "a^2^((^2 ) )  =   =  - _ i=0 _ i^a^2 ( ) ^i+1  , the anomalous dimension for the dimension - two local operator @xmath1 that can be found at the four - loop order in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this rg equation is obtained just by applying the logarithm derivative on the renormalization momentum , @xmath24 , to the two hand sides of . the boundary condition for the solution , [ eq : bc ]  =   ,",

    "in particular , for lattice regularization , we will have [ eq : gammarl ] ( p^2,a^-1 )  =   z(^2,a^-1 )  c_0^(,(^2 ) ) ( 1 +   +  )  , where @xmath28 is the lattice spacing and @xmath29 is an overall factor that , according to , coincide with @xmath30 . in order to solve , one can write [ eq : ans ]  =  ( ( ^2),(p^2 ) )   and solve for @xmath31 the same with the boundary condition @xmath32 . thus , we will obtain at the order @xmath2 [ eq : r ] & = & ( ) ^  12 ( ^2 ) ( 1 - 0.54993  ( ^2 ) - 0.14352  ^2(^2 ) - 0.07339  ^3(^2 ) ) + & & \\ {    lr ( 1 + 1.31808  ( p^2 ) + 1.51845  ^2(p^2 ) + 3.04851  ^3(p^2 ) ) &  g + ( 1 + 0.89698  ( p^2 ) + 0.84882  ^2(p^2 ) + 0.87056  ^3(p^2 ) ) &  f    .  , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand , respectively , for the gluon and ghost dressing functions and we take @xmath35 , the taylor coupling , for the expansion .",

    "t(p^2 )  =   f^2(p^2,a^-1 )  g(p^2,a^-1 )  .",

    "this confirms in a non trivial way the validity of our estimates for the lattice artifacts and the nonperturbative correction , .    in summary , we found unequivocal deviations for ghost and gluon lattice propagators with respect to their four - loop perturbative prediction that have been consistently and accurately accommodated within the nonperturbative ope approach",
    "the criterion to determine the best matching for the artefacts - free rescaled dressing functions , simulated at different @xmath79 parameters , is based on the minimization of the area between polynomial fits of data . to this purpose",
    ", we fit the data with legendre polynomials , [ eq : gpbeta ]  g(q^2,a^-1 ( ) )  =   _ i=0^n w_i ( )  p_i(2 - 1 )  =   f_(q )  , where @xmath80 is the @xmath81-th order legendre polynomial that , being defined within the interval @xmath82 , appears in written in terms of an argument that makes it to range from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , the lower and upper bounds for the fitting window .",
