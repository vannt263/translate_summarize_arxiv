    "every successful effort in investigation of some physical problem in strong interaction region usually brings new insight in behavior of corresponding system .",
    "thus , the outstanding results , obtained in the solution of one - dimensional model problems in quantum field theory , molecular and solid - state physics @xmath7 $ ] are of great interest .",
    "but the investigation becomes much more complicated when many - dimensional problems are approached .",
    "in such situation contradictory results are possible even in calculations of the system eigenenergy @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "the situation becomes even more dramatic while dealing with nonstationary problems with eigenfunctions basis , changing in time .",
    "the most important example of it is given by model of two - dimensional scattering problem , that is called collinear model for rearrangement @xmath9 .$ ] it is one of the simplest and still realistic descriptions of the three - body reaction of @xmath10 type .",
    "this problem can be of principle importance both for the practical applications in the theory of chemical reaction for moderate energies and for illuminating the mechanisms of rearrangement in multichannel scattering theory",
    ". it can be also regarded as a good testbed for application of nonperturbative method in realistic few body problem with all reaction channels involved .    in our previous paper",
    "@xmath11 $ ] it was shown , that in the limit @xmath12 this problem is effectively reduced to that for one - dimensional anharmonic oscillators with the frequency @xmath13 , changing in the field of external force @xmath14 .",
    "numerous quantum - chemical calculations of the potential energy surface for most popular three - particle systems have shown strong anharmonism in normal coordinate even for principle quantum number as low , as @xmath15 .    here",
    "we propose the method , that seems to be a natural development of the ideas of stationary perturbation theory of @xmath16 $ ] for the case of nonstationary coefficients of a zero - order equation .",
    "the method is of variational / iteration type and is essentially backed by main ideas of singular perturbation theory - one can expand only such parts of the solution , that do not bring singularities , and if one can not find pattern for singular part of the solution it is possible to expand it in the exponential .",
    "our final goal would be derivation of the scattering matrix representation , that makes it possible the simultaneous computation of the probabilities for all pertinent scattering mechanisms , taking into account close coupling of many channels , resonance effects and chaotic behavior in intermediate state",
    ".    the perturbation theory proposed might be especially interesting for calculation of wave packet of scattering system , since harmonic approximation , that exactly propagates gaussian wave packets , is a natural starting point of that theory @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "the suggested development covers also two of the principle questions of the quantum theory .",
    "first one is connected to the possibility of study of the quantum system behavior in the region of close coupling . for that purpose",
    "it is necessary to build up a perturbation theory , that do not need a knowledge of the spectrum of unperturbed system .",
    "also there are several such approaches ( see i.e. [ 3 ] ) , they are not generalized to nonstationary case and so are not suited for scattering problems .",
    "our method exactly serves for that purpose .",
    "second question is closely connected to the limits of quasiclassical description of the quantum system evolution .",
    "the traditional wkb approach , as it is well known , is limited for scattering applications . at the same time",
    "there is famous path integral approach that makes it possible to describe exactly quantum dynamics in terms of classical trajectories .",
    "so the basic question is how to improve the wkb approximation to describe all the effects , for which traditional approach fails .",
    "our investigations makes it possible to develope the representation of the scattering theory via the classical trajectories and so build up the intermediate approximate solutions between exact and primitive wkb forms .",
    "it is well known , that nonstationary form of the equation for quantum oscillator by a special transformations can be reduced to stationary form [ 10 ] , that can be solved exactly . in our case",
    "unfortunately the use of such approach is not very effective , sine after such transformation the perurbation becomes so complicated , that analytic computation of the perturbation matrix elements would be unrealistic .",
    "let us consider the schroedinger equation for one - dimensional nonstationary anharmonic oscillator    @xmath18    @xmath19    with @xmath20 being the oscillator wave function , @xmath3 being the dimensionless coupling parameter , and the perturbation potential @xmath21 , oscillator frequency @xmath13 and the external force @xmath14 having the following asymptotic behavior    @xmath22    let us assume , that solution of @xmath23 satisfies the following boundary and initial conditions    @xmath24 ,   \\end{array}\\ ] ]    were @xmath25 is a function of stationary anharmonic oscillator of initial channel .",
    "the physical meaning of those conditions is obvious - the decay of probability and its flow at infinity - and it corresponds to the formulation of the physical problems , discussed in introduction .",
    "when perturbation is absent , i.e. with @xmath26 , the equation    @xmath27    with boundary conditions @xmath28 , @xmath29 has an exact solution ( see i.e. @xmath30 $ ] )    @xmath31    @xmath32    @xmath33    @xmath34    @xmath35    with constant @xmath36 being the initial frequency , @xmath37 being the principle quantum number , @xmath38 being the adiabatically changing @xmath37-the energy level and the functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 satisfy the equations    @xmath41    with following asymptotic and initial conditions    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    it is well known , that solution of the second equation @xmath45 can be constructed on the base of solution of corresponding homogeneous equation    @xmath46 , \\qquad d\\left ( \\tau \\right ) = \\frac i{\\sqrt{\\omega _ { in}% } } \\int\\limits_{-\\infty } ^\\tau d\\tau ^{^{\\prime } } \\zeta \\left ( \\tau ^{^{\\prime } } \\right ) f\\left ( \\tau ^{^{\\prime } } \\right ) .\\ ] ]    semiclassical type analysis gives the following form of solution of @xmath47    @xmath48    with @xmath49 being the total wavefunction , that is being developed from the @xmath37-the asymptotic excited state at @xmath50 .",

    "but the more we try to take into account in the exponential , the more difficult would be the equations for individual members . in our case",
    "there is an optimal choice , that makes it possible to formulate additional condition for @xmath61 @xmath62 , and so to determine both functions @xmath52 and @xmath63 in ( 2.11 ) without ambiguity .",

    "before solving the equation @xmath71 let us note two important points    \\a ) the equation is not correctly formulated , as there are two unknown functions in one equation ,    \\b ) there is , in general , at least one singular member in this equation . it can be explained most easily from analysis of @xmath72 , taking into account , that @xmath73 includes the hermitian polynomial .",
    "this difficulty is readily solved if the perturbation is of polynomial form , as we would suppose in future .",
    "such form of perturbation does not seriously influence our discussion , as any smooth perturbation can be approximated by a finite part of its taylor expansion .    as in every exponential perturbation",

    "@xmath79 in a series of hermitian polynomials and supposing the absence of the members of an order , higher than @xmath37 , one can correctly determine the coefficients of polynomial @xmath81",
    "so , it is clear that both above difficulties are thus overcome and the system of equations @xmath82 is quite correct .",
