    "a _ sandwich beam _ is an engineering model for a three - layer beam consisting of stiff outer face plates and a more compliant inner core layer .",
    "sandwich beam models found in the literature include the models of mead and markus @xcite , rao and nakra ( rn ) @xcite , yan and dowell @xcite and others .",
    "the rn model assumes continuous , piecewise linear displacements through the cross - sections , with the kirchhoff hypothesis imposed on the face plates .",
    "transverse , longitudinal and rotational inertial forces are included in the modeling . in @xcite",
    "several possible multilayer generalizations of the basic three layer sandwich beam structure are derived and analyzed ( in the form of multilayer plates ) . in this paper",
    "we consider a multilayer generalization of the rn model described in @xcite .",
    "the model consists of @xmath0 alternating stiff and complaint ( core ) layers , with stiff layers on the outside .",
    "the stiff layers assume the kirchhoff hypothesis , while the compliant layers admit shear .",
    "the equations of motion for the associated beam model can be written : @xmath1 where @xmath2 primes denote differentiation with respect to the spatial variable @xmath3 and dots denote differentiation with respect to time @xmath4    in the above , @xmath5 represents the transverse displacement , @xmath6 denotes the shear angle in the @xmath7 layer , @xmath8^{\\rm t},$ ] @xmath9 denote the longitudinal displacement along the center of the @xmath7 layer , and @xmath10^{\\rm t}.$ ] throughout this paper we use the convention that quantities relating to the stiff layers have odd indices @xmath11 and quantities relating to the even layers have even indices @xmath12 .",
    "in addition , @xmath13 are positive physical constants , and @xmath14 where @xmath15 denote the density , thickness , young s modulus , and shear modulus of the @xmath7 layer , respectively .",
    "the vector @xmath16 is defined as @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the @xmath20 matrices @xmath21 and @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote column vectors with all entries of 1 in @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively .",
    "the aim of this paper is to prove that the uniform exponential stability of the rn system with standard boundary damping applied at one end point .",
    "consider ( [ main ] ) with the following boundary conditions @xmath26 and the initial conditions @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote constant positive feedback gains . throughout the paper , we assume @xmath30      boundary controllability of ( [ main ] ) has been studied in several papers . for the three layer case , in @xcite the multiplier method was used to prove exact controllability with a control for each equation applied at an end point .",
    "the moment method was used in @xcite to obtain boundary controllability for the multilayer case , but with the condition that wave speeds of the layers be distinct .",
    "the same approach was used to prove simultaneous controllability ( i.e. , with one boundary control instead of three ) for the three layer case in @xcite . in @xcite exact boundary controllability of the general multilayer system",
    "was proved for a variety of boundary conditions : clamped , hinged , clamped - hinged , and hinged - clamped .",
    "the results in @xcite improve earlier results in that there are no restrictions on the wave speeds or the size of @xmath31 and moreover , exact controllability is proved in the optimal time ( determined by characteristics ) . in @xcite ,",
    "@xcite exact controllability results for the multilayer rn plate system analogous to ( [ main ] ) with locally distributed control in a neighborhood of a portion of the boundary were obtained by the method of carleman estimates .",
    "stability results for layered beam systems closely related to ( [ main ] ) subject to internal damping proportional to rate - of - shear in one or more layers have been studied in several papers ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular , the approach used in @xcite was successfully applied in the dissertation @xcite to obtain uniform exponential stability results the system ( [ main ] ) with rate - of shear damping included in the compliant layers .    concerning boundary feedback stabilization of layered beam models , spectral methods ( based on the riesz basis property )",
    "are applied in @xcite to prove exponential stability results for a laminated beam model in @xcite .",
    "a similar approach is used in @xcite for the mead - markus model described in @xcite .",
    "there are also several results concerning the boundary feedback stabilization of a single rayleigh beam equation e.g. , @xcite , where a uniform exponential decay result is obtained for a rayleigh beam by means of a compact perturbation argument and @xcite where the riesz basis approach is used to obtain a similar stabilization result .",
    "some related uniform stabilization results for the kirchhoff plate are proved in @xcite .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ finaltheorem ] assume ( [ assump ] ) .",
    "then the semigroup generated by @xmath32 is exponentially stable in @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 @xmath35 such that @xmath36 moreover , @xmath37    in the above , @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath33 are defined in ( [ semigroupfor1 ] ) , ( [ energy ] ) , and ( [ semigroupdom ] ) respectively .",
    "our methodology in this paper is a combination of techniques used in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the decoupled system ( i.e. , ( [ main ] ) , with @xmath40 ) consists of a rayleigh beam equation and @xmath41 wave equations .",
    "we prove that the decoupled system has a riesz basis of eigenfunctions and obtain explicit asymptotic estimates on the eigenvalues .",
    "in particular , the eigenvalues of the decoupled system asymptotically lie along a finite number of vertical lines in the left half plane .",
    "we are able to prove that the family of eigenfunctions and generalized eigenfunctions of the decoupled system form a riesz basis and consequently ( see @xcite ) , the _ spectrum determined growth condition _ holds .",
    "this allows us to prove the exponential stability of the decoupled closed - loop system ( see theorem [ exp - ray ] ) .",
    "we mention that the exponential stabilization for the portion of the uncoupled system corresponding to the wave equations is well - known results , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "furthermore a number of results are known for stabilization of the rayleigh beam , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , however none of these results are applicable to the rayleigh beam with clamped - hinged boundary conditions which we consider .",
    "therefore we include a detailed proof of the exponential stability for the rayleigh beam .",
    "next , we prove that the system ( [ main])-([initial ] ) has a compact resolvent and is a compact perturbation of the decoupled system .",
    "therefore , exponential stability of ( [ main])-([initial ] ) follows from a perturbation theorem due to triggiani @xcite once it is shown that the semigroup generated by @xmath42 is strongly stable ( see theorem [ stronglystable ] ) . proving the strong stability involves use of dissipativity of the semigroup together with a nontrivial unique continuation argument that is proved in @xcite in application to the associated boundary control problem .",
    "our paper is organized as the following . in section [ wp ] , we give a semigroup formulation of ( [ main])-([initial ] ) .",
    "we prove that the semigroup is a @xmath43semigroup of contractions on an appropriate hilbert space . in section [ decoupled ] , we first prove that the generalized functions corresponding to the single rayleigh beam equation with the feedback applied to the moment forms a riesz basis . then , we show that the decoupled system , i.e. @xmath40 in ( [ main ] ) , has the riesz basis property . finally , we show that the decoupled system is exponentially stable . in section",
