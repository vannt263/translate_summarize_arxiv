    "the present work is motivated by recent articles in which the authors assign very exotic material parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( or effective refractive index @xmath3 ) for thin composite slabs consisting only of a few grids of interacting complex - shaped inclusions , e.g.  @xcite . in all of the above",
    "referred works the effective material parameters have been extracted using the @xmath0-parameter retrieval procedure whose underlying basics are described e.g.  in @xcite . in this procedure one replaces the actual structure by a slab of homogeneous material having a certain effective thickness and searches for effective material parameters that will reproduce the scattering results obtained with a normal plane - wave incidence .",
    "the method is often known to lead to antiresonant behavior for one of the extracted material parameters , which further leads to physically wrong sign for the imaginary part of the corresponding material parameter @xcite . according to the classical electrodynamics @xcite ,",
    "a physically meaningful material parameter is a linear response that must be independent of the electromagnetic field phasors excited in the medium , and especially in case of composite media , independent of the geometrical construction constituting the medium .",
    "moreover , the causality requirement ( which is directly related to the fulfillment of the kramers - kroning relations ) and the passivity requirement ( which relates to the allowed sign of the imaginary part ) must be simultaneously fulfilled @xcite .",
    "it is therefore clear that an effective parameter showing antiresonant behavior does not bear the meaning of a physically sound material parameter describing a real homogeneous material time dependence):@xmath4 the change of the sign assures that the poles of the function lie in the upper half - omega plane ( thus the function can be said to be causal ) , however , the sign of the real part of frequency derivative is wrong to fulfill the passivity requirement . ] , it only allows to reproduce the scattering scenario with a specific excitation @xcite . when adopting the aforementioned classical definition for physically sound material parameters it is clear that , according to this definition , the parameters presented e.g.  in @xcite are nonphysical",
    "also , in the view of classical homogenization approaches ( e.g.  @xcite ) it is clear that a structure consisting only of a few ( e.g.  two ) interacting grids of inclusions does not correspond to any slab of an effectively homogeneous material . in an effectively homogeneous material",
    "the unit cell should contain a large number of molecules or inclusions , and yet still remain small compared to the wavelength .",
    "this partly assures e.g.  that the change of the material sample thickness does not alter the polarization response of a small material volume .",
    "evidently , the material parameters assigned for thin composite slabs are _ mesoscopic _ , thus , they depend on the number of monolayers ( grids ) constituting the sample",
    ". most metamaterials and thin composite layers operate in the mesoscopic regime , intermediate between the homogeneous medium regime , and the regime of a collection of weakly interacting individual scatterers .",
    "typically the authors using the @xmath0-parameter retrieval procedure explain that the finite spatial periodicity of the sample causes the often observed antiresonant behavior .",
    "it is also well known that the method introduces an ambiguity in the phase of the wave reflected from finite thickness structures . to avoid this ambiguity",
    ", attempts have been made to assign effective material parameters for finite thickness complex slabs through refraction , rather than through reflection .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors a present clear discussion on the challenges to assign physically sound effective refractive index for wire medium slabs having a finite thickness .",
    "a small artificial interface shift is introduced for the actual structure and the authors use an iterative minimization technique to find the effective refractive index of a homogeneous slab that transmits the same amount of light as the actual complex structure ( essentially the same technique was used also e.g.  in @xcite ) .",
    "authors of @xcite also define the refractive index through reflection and transmission , but they search for the material parameters that allow one to reproduce the actual scattering results with all incidence angles ( note that the technique introduced e.g.  in @xcite uses only reflection and transmission data for a normally incident plane wave ) .",
    "motivated by the recent contradictory dispersion results obtained for single and double grids of interacting inclusions @xcite we turn our attention to single and double grids of loaded wires . grids of loaded wires are considered since the theory of interacting grids of such wires is well established and accurate @xcite , and certain specific loading scenarios allow us to simulate the dispersion properties of lattices of small dipole scatterers ( more discussion on this will be presented later ) .",
    "also , despite the fact that the local field approach used in this paper completely takes into account the near - field interactions ( all the higher - order floquet harmonics ) between the wires , is remains physically illustrative and computationally efficient .",
    "our goal is to assign mesoscopic material parameters for the proposed grids of wires directly by solving the induced dipole moment densities and averaged fields .",
    "recently we used the same approach for assigning effective material parameters for grids of interacting inclusions modeled as small electric dipole scatterers @xcite . in this work our goal is , in addition to studying different structures as considered in @xcite ,",
    "present a more extensive discussion on the physics behind the obtained polarization responses , and more systematically compare ( with double grid structures ) the proposed results to the results obtained using the @xmath0-parameter retrieval procedure .",
    "the details of derivation are introduced , and the obtained results and their physical meaning are thoroughly discussed .",
    "the known constitutive relations in a certain macroscopic medium ( or in a large sample of a certain macroscopic material ) read @xcite @xmath5 @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the averaged electric and magnetic flux density , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the averaged electric and magnetic field , @xmath11 is the averaged polarization ( electric dipole moment density ) , and @xmath12 is the averaged magnetization ( magnetic dipole moment density ) . when introducing a physically small averaging volume @xmath13 ,",
    "the average polarization and magnetization can be calculated as @xcite @xmath14 @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the microscopic current density confined in the averaging volume , and the integration is done over that volume .    in the following analysis",
    "our strategy is to first solve the current induced to the wires by the incident field , taking into account the full interaction between all the wires . after this , we define an artificial unit volume and calculate the macroscopic polarization and magnetization using eqs .",

    "the amplitude of the local electric field acting on the reference wire can also be expressed in the following manner : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the amplitude of the external field at the surface of the reference wire and @xmath32 is so called self interaction coefficient given by eq .  ( 11 ) in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) : @xmath33 is the euler constant .",
    "physically @xmath32 tells how strongly the wires located in the same grid as the reference wire contribute to the amplitude of the local field . from eqs .",
    "( [ eloc1 ] ) and ( [ eloc2 ] ) we can solve the amplitude of current induced to the reference wire as @xmath34    next , let us turn our attention to the definition of the material parameters .",

    "importantly we also observe that for the _ oblique incidence _ also higher order floquet harmonics contribute to the scattered electric field calculated over the unit volume thickness .",
    "neglecting the effect of these harmonics would leave us with non - local mesoscopic permittivity @xcite .",
    "the fact that the above deduced permittivity is not independent of the field phasors excited in the slab ( incidence angle ) , or the geometrical construction ( thickness ) constituting the slab clearly indicates that the permittivity function does not fulfill the classical criteria set for physically sound material parameters of a real homogeneous material @xcite . nevertheless , when accepting this fact and bearing in mind the mesoscopic nature of the deduced parameter , the permittivity expression is still useful in studying practically engineered slabs ( although they are not sufficient for enough complete description of the composite ) :  correctly deduced mesoscopic material parameters contain physically sound information about the actual ( microscopic ) polarization response of the structure .      in this subsection",

    "these parameters are kept the same throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "we consider three different loading scenarios :    1 .   the wires in the grid(s )",
    "are unloaded ( @xmath29 ) , 2 .",
    "the wires are loaded with bulk capacitors [ @xmath66 , 3 .",
    "the wires are loaded with a parallel connection of bulk capacitors and inductors [ @xmath67 .",
    "please note that we do not separately consider the loading of the wires with bulk inductors or with a series connection of bulk capacitors and inductors .",
    "these two situations effectively resemble the scenarios described in items 1 ) and 2 ) , as the effect of inductive loading in series can be attributed to the change of the effective wire radius @xcite .",

    "( [ rt ] ) are depicted as a function of the normalized wire separation in fig .",
    "we qualitatively repeat the well known observation ( e.g.  @xcite ) according to which at low frequencies the grid is strongly reflective ( the wave does not probe the fine details of the grid ) .",
    "note that the normalized frequency @xmath68 corresponds to a certain kind of resonance @xcite :  at this frequency the contribution from the other wires to the local electric field acting on the surface of the reference wire adds up in phase .",
    "however , the field amplitude at the wire surface must be limited which is only possible when the current induced to the grid is zero , thus , the grid is ideally transparent at this frequency .    for the calculation of the mesoscopic permittivity",
    "we need to choose the unit cell thickness  @xmath43 .",
    "one rather intuitive choice is @xmath69 .",
    "in addition to this , we partly follow the analysis of @xcite where the the authors use an artificial interface shift @xmath70 on both sides of stacks of wire grids when representing the actual structures as slabs made of homogeneous material . thus , in the second scenario @xmath71",
    "( when representing the grid as a homogeneous slab we imagine that there is an artificial interface shift @xmath70 on both sides of the grid ) .    the permittivities for the both aforementioned situations , calculated using eq .",

    "[ eeff1 ] .",
    "we notice that in both cases the permittivity is purely real as it should be since the wires ( and the background medium ) are lossless . in the case",
    "@xmath69 the frequency derivative of permittivity is positive over the entire frequency range , thus , the permittivity function strictly satisfies the passivity requirement .",
    "interestingly , however , this is not the case when we introduce the artificial interface shift : the permittivity has a maximum roughly at @xmath72 , and the slope becomes negative as the frequency approaches the point @xmath68 . at these frequencies",
    "the permittivity function will lead to a physically wrong sign for the imaginary part when inserted into the kramers - kroning relations .",
    "however , also the wire spacing is comparable to the wavelength at these frequencies and the validity of the effective medium description is weak . at frequencies below @xmath73 we can , however , at least qualitatively make some interesting observations from the results depicted in fig .",
    "[ eeff1 ] .    typically in the quasi - static regime the effective permittivity of infinite lattices of unloaded wires ( when excited with normally incident planes waves )",
    "is described using the lossless drude model ( e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the angular `` plasma '' frequency which is determined by the structural parameters of the grid .",
    "if we assume that instead of a single grid of wires we would investigate the properties of an infinite wire lattice with rectangular periodicity ( the lattice constant in both transversal directions would be @xmath76 ) , the normalized wire medium plasma frequency , estimated using equations available in @xcite , would be @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath71 we estimate from fig .",
    "[ eeff1 ] that @xmath78 .",
    "actually , a similar observation has been made already in @xcite : the authors observed that in case of an interface shift corresponding roughly to @xmath70 the effective permittivity of an equivalent homogeneous slab simulating the single grid closely approximates the permittivity of an infinite lattice .",
    "this is intuitively rather clear after simple symmetry considerations @xcite .",
    "when the unit cell thickness @xmath69 the behavior of the permittivity function is dramatically different compared to the case @xmath71 .",

    "the corresponding effective permittivities characterizing these homogeneous slabs are those shown in fig .",

    "we use standard equations for calculating the reflection and transmission coefficients through such homogeneous slabs , see e.g.  the transmission matrix formalism presented in [ 22 , ch .",
    "the results are depicted in fig .",
    "[ rtc1 ] .    in the first case",
    "the effective slab thickness equals to the diameter of the wires , and we observe a very close agreement between the exact result depicted in fig .  [ rt1 ] , and the result calculated for the homogeneous slab . for this specific example",
    "we have , thus , verified that the effective permittivity depicted in fig .",
    "[ eeff1 ] correctly describes the actual ( microscopic ) polarization response of the grid , and also allows to reproduce the reflection and transmission results with a normal plane - wave incidence .",
    "when the slab thickness equals the wire spacing the agreement between the exact result and the result depicted in fig .  [ rtc1 ] is good roughly up to @xmath80 . at higher frequencies",
    "the discrepancy is visible ( please remember also the discussion concerning the meaningfulness of the permittivity function for this case at frequencies above @xmath72 ) .",
    "it is evident from the results that the effective permittivity for this situation ( see fig .",
    "[ eeff1 ] ) does not allow to reproduce the actual reflection and transmission results with normal plane wave incidence .",
    "obviously the difficulties arise from the correct definition of the equivalent homogeneous slab thickness . however , permittivity defined when @xmath71 gives a good estimate for the macroscopic polarization response of an infinite wire lattice ( at least up to frequencies @xmath72 , in our example case ) .",
    "let us next load the wires by bulk capacitors whose value is chosen to be @xmath81 pf .",
    "it is known @xcite that when the load capacitance value is infinitely small , the dispersion characteristics of a lattice of such wires resemble the characteristics of a lattice of point dipole scatterers . when a realistic load capacitance value and the insertion period are correctly chosen , this equivalence holds still , to some extend , at low frequencies @xcite .",
    "thus , one can consider a properly capacitively loaded wire grid as a grid of short wire ( dipole ) scatterers .",
    "non - physical dispersion results ( defined through reflection and transmission ) for grids of such inclusions have been presented earlier e.g.  in @xcite .    the reflection and transmission coefficients calculated using eq .",

    "we see that there appears a stop - band not observed in the previous case ( grid of unloaded wires ) .",
    "the behavior seen in fig .",
    "[ rt12 ] can be explained ( qualitatively ) by regarding the grid as a bulk load , consisting of a series connection of inductance and capacitance , in a waveguide representing free space wave propagation @xcite . at low frequencies",
    "the impedance of the grid is strongly capacitive and the load represents an open circuit in the waveguide , thus , waves can propagate through the grid . at some frequency",
    "the wires are in self - resonance , and in this case the waveguide is effectively short - circuited leading to a stop - band @xcite .",

    "( [ epseff1 ] ) for this case is shown in fig .",
    "[ eeff12_t ] .",
    "the permittivity is purely real , and we observe that it obeys a lorentz - type behavior , which is consistent with the effective permittivity deduced for a semi - infinite capacitively loaded wire medium @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an amplitude factor depending on the load capacitance value and the structural parameters of the grid ( also @xmath75 in this case depends on both the structural parameters and the load capacitance value ) .",
    "this behavior is physically due to the fact that in the self - resonance the distributed impedance value on the wire surfaces is low and allows strong current to be induced to the wire .",
    "strong induced current directly means strong polarization response , therefore the very high ( resonant ) value of the permittivity .",
    "moreover , the choice of the unit cell thickness @xmath43 again dictates the strength of the polarization response .",
    "please note that in reality , due to finite conductivity of the wires and parasitic losses in the lumped elements , the effective permittivity would show a significant imaginary part in the vicinity of the resonance as is imposed by the kramers - kroning relations .",
    "similarly as with the grid of unloaded wires we observe that the permittivity , when defined using @xmath69 , is a monotonically growing function outside the resonant band",
    ". a closer investigation of the permittivity function , defined when @xmath71 , reveals that the slope of the function is negative between the frequencies @xmath72 ... @xmath68 .",
    "the behavior at these frequencies is therefore similarly nonphysical as with the grid of unloaded wires ( however , also the effective medium description is weak ) .",
    "authors of @xcite considered an infinite lattice of capacitively loaded wires and deduced the following quasi - static limit for the effective permittivity in case of relatively high capacitive impedance ( the notation is clear from fig .",

    "[ 2grid ] ) .",
    "the calculated mesoscopic effective material parameters are depicted in fig .",
    "[ eeff22_t ] .",
    "please note that all the material parameters are purely real and behave in a physically sound manner ( the frequency derivative is positive everywhere outside the resonance region ) .",
    "moreover , the frequency dependence of both parameters clearly resembles the behavior predicted by the classical lorentz model .",
    "the behavior in the effective permittivity arises from the self - resonance of the wires , i.e.  when the load circuitry is in series resonance the current induced to the wires will be strong leading to a strong polarization response .",
    "the resonant permeability arises from circulating out - of - phase currents flowing in the grids .",
    "the difference in the current amplitudes flowing in the grids is minimized at a slightly higher frequency as compared to the deep reflection minimum observed in fig .",
    "therefore the reflection minimum ( in this particular case ) does not exactly correspond to the resonant point of permeability .",
    "it is also worth to observe that resonance in permeability is a very narrowband phenomenon compared to the resonance in permittivity .",
    "this is because the mutual cancelation of the grid currents occurs in a narrow frequency window due to very strong mutual coupling ( very small grid separation ) between the grids .",
    "it is also worthwhile to notice that both mesoscopic effective parameters are negative in a narrow frequency band just above the resonance of permeability , thus , the polarization response at this frequency range can be described by assigning `` negative effective refractive index '' for the structure .",
    "we have to bear in mind , however , the important physical limitations outlined above for the introduction of effective parameters for thin complex slabs .",
    "one should also observe that the amplitudes of permittivity and permeability ( fig .",
    "[ eeff22_t ] ) are at the same ( negative ) level only over an extremely narrow frequency band .",
    "this means that the structure ( with these particular structural dimensions and load values ) would be very difficult to match to incident radiation . when the unit cell thickness is @xmath101 and @xmath93 , eq .",
    "( [ qlim ] ) predicts @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "the corresponding values read from fig .",
    "[ eeff22_t ] are @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "static permeabilities for both effective slab thicknesses equal unity .",
    "comparison between the results obtained using the proposed method and the @xmath0-parameter retrieval method is depicted in fig .",
    "[ c_comp ] .",
    "the thickness of the equivalent homogeneous slab equals the physical thickness ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "interestingly , the effective permittivities agree rather well over the whole depicted frequency range ( visible disagreement is observed only close to the permittivity resonance point ) .",
    "however , the effective permeabilities obtained using different methods behave in a visibly different manner :  the predicted magnetic response of the double grid is much weaker according to the @xmath0-parameter retrieval results .",
    "also , it is evident that the function predicted by the @xmath0-parameter retrieval method can not be represented using the causal lorentz model .",
    "the reflection and transmission coefficients , calculated when the actual structure is represented as a slab of homogeneous material ( the material parameters are those depicted in fig .  [ eeff22_t ] ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ rt2c21 ] .",
    "we notice that in the vicinity of the resonant point of material parameters there appears several thickness resonances . at other frequencies",
    "the agreement between the exact result ( fig .",
    "[ rt12 ] ) and the results calculated for the homogeneous slabs is rather good .",
    "we can conclude that the effective material parameters , shown in fig .",
    "[ eeff22_t ] , correctly describe what kind of polarization mechanism takes place in the microstructural level .",
    "however , when the actual grid structure is represented as a homogenized slab , the proposed mesoscopic parameters do not allow to exactly reproduce the reflection / transmission results .",
    "visible disagreement is observed close to the resonant points of the material parameters .",
    "close to these resonant frequencies the electrical slab thickness is very large , and this leads to several closely located thickness resonances not observed with the actual grid structure .",
    "note that when the wires are non - resonant , e.g.  unloaded as in the previous subchapter , the agreement between the reflection / transmission results for the actual structure and homogenized slabs is rather good over the entire spectral range .",
    "this indicates that when the slab is electrically very dense it is difficult to assign the correct equivalent slab thickness reproducing the scattering scenario ( intuitively this is clear since the double - grid can not physically correspond to a sample of any homogeneous material ) .",
    "it it important to bear in mind that the above mentioned deficiencies are avoided with the @xmath0-parameter retrieval method since the method is based on the fulfillment of the actual scattering scenario .",
    "however , as is shown by the above example ( and will further be shown below ) , the material parameter functions obtained using the @xmath0-parameter retrieval results might not satisfy the causality or the passivity requirement ( see also e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we proceed on studying the situation when the wires are loaded with bulk connections of capacitances and inductances . the reflection and transmission coefficients",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ rt23 ] , and they again resemble the results obtained with the corresponding single grid .",
    "however , as explained in the previous subchapter , there appears a narrow additional transmission window due to interaction between the grids ( this corresponds to the reflection minimum around @xmath106 point ) .",
    "the mesoscopic effective material parameters are shown in fig .  [ eeff23_t ] .",
    "all the parameters are purely real and grow as a function of frequency outside the resonance regions .",
    "qualitative description presented in connection with the corresponding single grid still holds , however , as is clear from the discussion in the previous subchapter , the out - of - phase currents flowing in the grids leads to a resonant effective permeability . again over a narrow frequency band just above the permeability resonance both material parameters are negative .",
    "[ lc_comp ] compares the effective material parameters obtained using the proposed method and the @xmath0-parameter retrieval procedure for the case when the slab thickness equals the physical thickness . when inspecting the parameters obtained through the @xmath0-parameter retrieval procedure we observe the branch point of effective refractive index at @xmath107 .",
    "however , even when excluding the disturbance caused by the compensation of the branch jump the permeability function , obtained using the @xmath0-parameter retrieval procedure , is clearly nonphysical .",
    "the reflection / transmission results for the homogeneous slabs ( the effective parameters are those shown in fig .  [ eeff23_t ] ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ rt2c31 ] .",
    "the behavior is qualitatively similar to the behavior with a double grid of capacitively loaded wires ( please see the discussion in the previous subchapter ) .",
    "we have studied single and double grids of wires loaded with a certain distributed reactive impedance as an example of thin composite slabs .",
    "the currents induced by a normally incident plane wave to all the wires have been rigorously calculated taking into account the full interaction between the wires .",
    "using the aforementioned data we have calculated the average polarization and magnetization induced to the structures , and the averaged fields confined in the unit volume . using these quantities",
    "we have introduced mesoscopic effective material parameters for the proposed thin composite slabs .",
    "a large set of calculated example results has been provided .",
