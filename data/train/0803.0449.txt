    "the evolution of massive stars is an important topic of stellar astrophysics , because it provides clues to the mechanisms that feed the galactic medium with the building blocks of future generations of stars . during their evolution ,",
    "massive stars having a solar composition lose some large fraction of their mass towards the interstellar medium and may eventually explode as supernovae near the end of their lifetimes .",
    "owing to their weaker winds , the outcomes for metal poor stars are still unsettled but may be quite different .",
    "many of the evolutionary stages of massive stars are short - lived and hence challenge our ability to characterize them in an evolutionary scheme . detecting objects in these brief phases of evolution should be of great aid to test current theories of massive star evolution , especially if they represent populations with low metal abundances , a condition that is found in the large and particularly in the small magellanic clouds .",
    "catalogs of be star candidates , that is , b stars with extraordinary variable light curves in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. , mennickent et al .",
    "2002 , hereafter m02 and sabogal et al .",
    "2006 ) , provide excellent material for detailed analysis of possible massive pre - main sequence objects and blue stars in rapid evolution stages in these galaxies .",
    "a census of the pre - main sequence population of massive stars in the clouds has not yet compiled and thus is poorly known .",
    "in fact , only a few objects have recently been placed in this category ( beaulieu et al .",
    "1996 , lamers et al .",
    "1999 , de wit et al .",
    "2002 , de wit et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the general characteristics of these objects are their infrared excesses , usual association with nearby nebulosities , their irregular photometric variability , and , when well enough studied at high spectroscopic resolution , evidence of infalling circumstellar matter . in their study of photometric ogle light curves of b - type variables in the small magellanic cloud",
    ", m02 speculated that some of the quasi - periodic or periodic variables ( type-3 stars ) they discovered might be pre - main sequence b stars surrounded by massive gas envelopes .",
    "alternatively , we note that other objects described in the m02 and sabogal et al .",
    "( 2006 ) catalogues have a number of similarities with the group of b[e ] variables , of which only five are currently known in the smc ( wisziewski et al .",
    "2007 ; w07 ) . these are b stars with spectra exhibiting hydrogen line emissions , @xmath0 color excesses between 1.2 and 4 magnitudes , and occupy regions usually well above the main sequence of the h - r diagram ( e.g. , zickgraf et al .",
    "1998 , zickgraf et al . 1996 , and w07 ) .",
    "lamers et al .",
    "( 1998 ) describe these stars as exhibiting moderate to large infrared excesses , generally irregular light curves , the presence of nonspherical circumstellar ( cs ) structures , winds , and in their spectra emission lines of permitted feii and [ feii ] and [ oi ] . according to these authors , the b[e ] stars",
    "are a highly heterogeneous general population , consisting of five subclasses .",
    "two of these subclasses , the  sgb[e ] \" ( supergiant ) stars and the  unclassified , \" can exhibit long - term variations in their light curves . in particular ,  algol - like variations \" in the light curves have been discussed for a few b[e ] stars like hd45677 and uxori ( de winter & van den ancker 1997 , grinin et al .",
    "the variations of these stars are aperiodic and are generally confined to long intervals of a few years .",
    "the sgb[e ] stars have a particular set of properties that are largely , though not completely , similar to our program objects .",
    "for example , the sgb[e ] variations _ can _ have lower luminosities than supergiant b stars and photometric ir excesses indicative of the presence of warm cs dust . as for the more general group of b[e ] stars , the sgb[e ] stars",
    "have spectra that display forbidden lines of [ feii ] and in some cases molecular lines ( heydari - malayeri 1990 , gummersbach et al .",
    "1996 , wisziewski et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "one of the interesting properties of the high luminosity b[e ] stars , that could be relevant for the objects discussed in this paper , is their hybrid wind character , that is , a dual wind structure consisting of a dense slow outflow at the equator and a fast hot one in the polar regions .",
    "pelupessy et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and others have argued that this structure results from a combination of the bistability mechanism for a polar component and rotationally induced wind compression for wind efflux emanating from the stellar equatorial regions .",
    "kraus & lamers ( 2003 ) have presented empirical density models for sgb[e ] star wind / disk system .",
    "their central argument is that in order to permit the presence of appreciable warm dust and co and tio molecules , the equatorial regions must be optically thick and outflowing slow to effectively shield gas and thereby permit formation of multiatomic species .",
    "the kraus & lamers models exhibit disk - like structures for which loci of constant ionization fan outward from the central plane from distance . this permits the detection of multiple types of species by observers at intermediate aspects to the star - disk system . depending on the details of the model solution and the ionization level chosen , these contours may or may not touch the stellar surface . in particular , the hei ionization surface seems most assured of touching the surface , but because it opens to the widest angle it would likely contribute the smallest column length to cs line formation .    knowing that any study of m02 variable stars requires spectroscopic follow - up to fully understand their variability , we selected in year 2001 two type-3 stars for a high resolution spectroscopic analysis with the eso ultraviolet - visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) .",
    "the stars chosen were those in the m02 catalog having visual magnitudes brighter than 14.2 .",
    "there are 8 stars satisfying this condition among the 78 smc type-3 stars so cataloged .",
    "we selected this luminosity simply to assure reasonably high s / n in the spectra during the short available observing window we had available with the uves .",
    "the stars were chosen   ( @xmath1 smc - sc3 - 63371 , macho i d 213.15560 ; hereafter ) and   ( @xmath1 smc - sc4 - 67145 , macho i d 212.15735.6 ; hereafter ) .",
    "spectra of both objects showed strong cs gas absorptions .",
    "this fact motivated us to obtain additional optical and also fuv spectroscopy , leading to the broad - band study described in this paper .   is a probable member of the open cluster ngc242 ( at a distance of @xmath2 10 \" from the cluster center ) .",
    "m02 reports for this star two periodicities of 118 and 15 days , whereas   is an emission line object showing occultations ( brightness minima ) that recur every 184 days or so , with additional nearly periodic photometric variability in time scales of @xmath224 days ( mennickent et al .",

    "high resolution spectra at resolving power @xmath2 40000 were obtained on 2001 may 17 with the uves spectrograph in dichroic modes at the ut2 telescope in the eso paranal observatory , chile .",

    "a slit width of 1 `` was used , allowing us to obtain good spectra in 600 sec exposures .",

    "in 2007 november 09 . for this double echelle spectrograph",

    "these data cover the continuous wavelength of approximately @xmath6929 - 1187    by means of eight independent mama detector segments .",
    "the spectral resolving power among these varies but is typically 15000 .",
    "the spectra were reduced with the calfuse version 3.1.8 pipeline system , which was very similar to the last version used for the final reprocessing of the _ fuse _ archive .",
    "much of the analysis in this paper relies on spectral line synthesis , so we first describe the methods used for this analysis .",
    "we have assumed logg = 3.5 , appropriate for luminosity class i , early b - type stars ( crowther et al .",
    "2006 ) , and a metallicity of 0.2@xmath7 solar for our objects ( e.g. , dolphin et al .",
    "2001 , mighell et al .",
    "1998 , dufton et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the spectra were analyzed using hubeny / lanz synspec and circus programs ( hubeny , lanz , & jeffery 1994 , hubeny & heap 1996 ) . for circus analysis",
    "an input temperature for an intervening circumstellar structure , @xmath8 , and other parameters must be assumed as well .",
    "the feii and siii lines below suggest a microturbulence @xmath9 in the range of 5 - 10 kms@xmath10 and we assume the disk is comoving at a constant velocity .",
    "we also posited that the foreground  cloud \" ( cs wind / disk ) covers the star completely in our models .",
    "these assumptions require the matching of the computed equivalent widths to the observations using a two - parameter fit in @xmath8 and column density .",
    "it was readily apparent , both from the columns needed to fit the observed line strengths as well as from strength ratios of lines arising from the same ion , that the cs lines are optically thick .",
    "in some cases the lines are observed to have peak equivalent widths ( ews ) as large as we can compute them even from assumed optimal conditions .",
    "this suggests that they are indeed formed in conditions near the optimal @xmath8 and column density values .",
    "however , this assumption does impose errors , generally as underestimates in the column density .",
    "thus , if the temperature other than the optimal value , a larger column density will be required in the line fitting .",
    "this dependence emphasizes correlated errors in the determination of the column density and assumed @xmath8 .",
    "most of our analysis is for absorption features .",
    "however , for the cases of far - uv ciii multiplet , the optical hei , and strong feii lines , we fit line profiles with a medium radiating in emission , that is , as if were formed in lines of sight other than than those intersecting the star disk .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for   we estimated a spectral type of o9-b0 , based , first , on fitting of the wings of both hei 3821   and h@xmath12 as compared to these wings in o7-b0 ib - iii stars taken from the uves pop webpages ( bagnulo et al .",
    "the ( usually red ) wings of the balmer and paschen lines were also used to confirm this spectral type and teff , given the implied luminosity class of iii .",
    "the ciii 1176   widths / wings suggest a slightly cooler spectral type of 30 - 32kk .",
    "based on this , we used 31kk , logg= 3.5 from kurucz models ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "the precise photospheric temperature does not appear to be important in the modeling of the cs absorptions discussed herein .",
    "it is not clear how many lines in our spectra of   are photospheric , but they are few in number .",
    "the best candidates are the far wings of the balmer and paschen lines and the wings of ciii 1176    ( figs.4 and 5 ) . from the similarity in the @xmath13 magnitude",
    "we also take this star to have a luminosity class of about iii .",
    "the wings of the hydrogen lines are more developed in , suggesting a slightly later type .",
    "however , the ciii 1176   feature is indistinguishable from the   line . to split the difference between the implied values of @xmath14 , we used a kurucz model of 29 kk , logg= 3.5 to model the photospheric fluxes .    because of the dearth of photospheric lines we have had to rely on the radial velocity differences of the galactic ( lism ) and local ( smc ) ism line components",
    "we then tied the lism radial velocity to the sun s so that this ism velocity difference could be taken as an estimate of the program stars systemic velocities .",
    "ism components of a number of low excitation ions are plentiful in our _ fuse _ spectra , and we were able to measure velocity differences for both stars . our results for   and , respectively , were 119@xmath15 kms@xmath4 ( 39 lines ) and 110@xmath16 kms@xmath4 ( 25 lines ) , referencing the zeropoint to the measured lism wavelengths . as a check on these results , we consulted the tomlinson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) compendium of measured smc ism lines .",
    "the comparable - brightness objects lying closest in the sky to our program stars , av14 and av15 , have rvs of 124 kms@xmath4 and 130 kms@xmath4 ( with @xmath17 kms@xmath4 ) , which are in the expected rough agreement .",
    "furthermore , the measurements of the optical lines discussed in section 4.2.1 are consistent with these rv values and a low velocity cs expanding medium in both our 2001 and 2007 data .      _",
    "a. general description : _    with the exception of the broad wings of @xmath18 , hei 3821 , and possibly of the far - uv ciii 1176   multiplet , none of its optical or near - ir lines are photospheric .",
    "rather , they reflect different kinematic and thermal properties of an extensive circumstellar envelope .",
    "the orbit of a dense property may be responsible for the near or strict periodicity with a period of 119 days .",
    "the high - level balmer and paschen lines can be resolved to h30 and p24 , respectively , leading us to estimates of a mean envelope volume density of @xmath2 1@xmath710@xmath19 @xmath20 .",
    "the first few members of the balmer line spectrum show strong emission , with @xmath21 = 24@xmath22 , and @xmath23 = 0.9 ( table 7 and fig.6 ) .",
    "we have no direct information on the degree of flattening of this disk structure , but the separated @xmath23 h@xmath24 components suggest a quasi - keplerian rotation of this structure .",
    "we say  quasi",
    "\"- keplerian because of the likely very slow outflow of the gas from the star discussed below .",
    "hereinafter , we will refer to a slow wind and quasi - keplerian disk interchangeably .",
    "the optical spectrum of   exhibits only various permitted lines formed at  hot , \"  warm , \" and  cool \" temperatures .",
    "these lines are mainly in absorption , but a few feii lines exhibiting emission wing components will be highlighted below .",
    "the high excitation lines of hei , 5876    and 7865  , are present weakly in emission .",
    "their profiles are narrow and they can be fit with circus models having (  hot \" ) temperature of 1525kk ( probably closer to the upper limit ) with column densities of 5 - 10@xmath710@xmath25@xmath26 .",
    "the principal metallic line features are feii and siii absorptions , and these are formed at",
    " warm \" temperatures of 6 - 9kk ( fig .",
    "we suspect also that the excited oi 7771 - 5   triplet ( @xmath27 = 9ev ) is formed in the same warm region as the strong feii lines .",
    "both groups of lines have turbulence - broadened wings and are formed optimally in a warm environment .",
    "the resonance doublet of nai and ki doublets are both formed at  cool \" ( @xmath286kk ) temperatures .",
    "although the presence of these lines give the red / near - ir spectrum the appearance of an f - g supergiant photosphere ( m06 ) , close inspection at high resolution demonstrates that the nad lines have multiple components and a shaded blue - wing , suggesting a highly differentiated velocity structure . in our _ fuse _ spectra",
    ", we are able to make out both the galactic and smc ism components ; the latter appear to show only one significant component toward either of our program stars .",
    "the radial velocities ( rv ) of the nai lines range from those exhibited by the balmer , fe , and si lines to the largest measured , possibly indicating an outflow with a larger velocity gradient than found in the component forming the latter group of lines .",
    "fig4 shows that in the case of   a portion of the line ( blue wing ) is formed in a region flowing outward faster than the flow of the mean disk .",
    "one interesting aspect of the strongest metallic lines of   ( but not ) is that in addition to their sharp cores they also have strong wings ( fig.8a ) .",
    "however , these wings are neither extensively tapered nor symmetric , i.e. , the profiles do not resemble lorenzians . also , because some of these wings , notably those of feii 5018 ,   5169 ,   and 5197   are in emission , and because the excitation potentials of the lines can be low , we strongly doubt that these lines components are photospheric . in the case of fig.8a",
    "we obtained similar fits with microturbulence ( @xmath2950 kms@xmath4 ) or macroturbulences ( @xmath2960 kms@xmath4 ) and for column densities of at least twice those ( i.e. , @xmath292@xmath710@xmath30 @xmath26 ) needed for the inner region of these lines .",
    "_ b. fitting equivalent widths with   circus : _    our modeling proceeded in most cases with a single microturbulence value ( @xmath9 = 5 - 10 kms@xmath4 ) and one temperature .",
    "the sample of fitted lines shown below is a strategically chosen subset of a larger group of fitted lines . except for hei lines and nai and ki doublets , we are able to model all the uves lines of both   and   with t@xmath31 values of either 8kk or 5kk . in some short stretches of the spectrum",
    "two different temperatures are necessary ( fig.7 ) , meaning that actually the temperatures vary smoothly with position from the star .",
    "we have also been able to fit the emissions of feii 5018   ( fig.8b ) using an lte representation ( emission + absorption ) components .",
    "other lines are represented by absorption only , i.e. the source function in the line is zero . excepting the hydrogen lines as one proceeds to less excited species , higher and higher column densities are necessary to fit the spectra , e.g. 13@xmath710@xmath25 for hei , and about 1@xmath710@xmath30 @xmath26 for the 5kk and 8kk gas components .",
    "in contrast , the optical depth of the high level balmer lines , which are formed in gas with all these temperatures , suggests a total hydrogen - absorbing column density of about 10@xmath32 @xmath26 and a volumetric density of 10@xmath19 @xmath33 .    we have attempted to fit the @xmath34 emission strength .",
    "using our lte models with @xmath8 = 9kk and @xmath9= 10 km / s , we found an implied total area of @xmath210000 stellar areas , such that the extent of the disk is roughly @xmath2 100@xmath35 .",
    "this is roughly consistent within the errors with the @xmath36 velocity separations indicated in fig.6 and also with the disk emission area of 2500 areas we derive from the feii 5018   emission ( fig.8b ) .",
    "however , we reiterate that these fittings were done with lte models , the numerical value we derived especially for h@xmath37 should be taken at most to an order of magnitude .",
    "additional evidence of a warm emitting gas seen beyond - the - limb sight lines is furnished by the weakened ciii 1176   multiplet , which requires hot gas to mimic a @xmath2925% dilution of the line by an additional radiation field .",
    "we require a @xmath8 = 25kk component having about 5 emitting stellar areas to accomplish this ( fig.5a ) . in principle",
    ", these emission areas can be used to compute hydrogenic stromgren spheres .",
    "we estimate that the radius of this sphere is that of a o9.5-b0 star , consistent with our estimate in section 4.2.1 from the 1176   and optical hi and hei lines .",
    "we also point out that the 25% dilution for ciii 1176 ,   suggesting a substantial far - uv continuum emission component , from a volume _ around _ the star , is greater than the several percent dilution we observe in the d lines .",
    "this suggests that flux contribution in optical wavelength is smaller , and this is generally consistent with the inference that the far - uv continuum emission comes from a region cooler than the photosphere .",
    "nearly everything stated about   in its introduction is also true of .",
    "once again it was difficult to find photospheric absorption lines ; the   spectral type may be o9-b0 or b0 , according to its stronger h - line wings .",
    "the high level balmer line limits are h29 and p23 ( compared to h30 and p24 for ) , so its mean volume density and total column density is close to than the disk densities for .",
    "the @xmath34 emission is 4 times weaker than for   ( @xmath21 = 6@xmath22 ) , and v / r @xmath2 1 ( fig.6 ) . assuming a similar excitation temperature and a similar electron density from the visibility of the high level balmer lines , the gas component of the   disk is about half as extensive as the   disk .",
    "multiple temperature fits were constructed using circus for several features in the uves spectrum , just as with for .",
    "the gas in s disk likewise shows layered temperatures .",
    "again as with ,   there is evidence of line or continuum emission close to the star , and there is a very faint emission in the hei 5015    line .",
    "the 5876   and 7065   lines consist of both weak emission and absorption components . also , our remarks for the dilution of the   ciii 1176  are equally valid for the fitting of this feature in the   spectrum - see fig.5b .",
    "as before , in order to fit the ciii1176   feature we had to introduce a hot emitting region of about 5 stellar areas to the photospheric flux . for both stars it appear that this flux is consistent with the appearance of the hei lines in the optical spectrum .    in the   spectrum",
    "the observed lines are formed exclusively in absorption and arise from a diversty of excitation states .",
    "these include the hydrogen lines , the high excitation oi 7771 - 5   triplet ( 9ev ) , the many lines of feii and siii , and finally the nad and ki resonance doublets .",
    "our models show that the ki line is formed at a temperature of 5kk or less .",
    "a comparative weakness of the ki and oi lines in the   spectrum is consistent with the only moderate emission in h@xmath37 .",
    "the primary difference that the smc - sc4 spectrum exhibits with respect to smc - sc3 is the presence of one or two discrete blue absorption components in almost all the metallic lines .",
    "we call these features `` bacs . ''",
    "these are blueshifted by 50 - 58 km / s relative to their  main \" absorption members . as an example , the strongest feii lines ( fig.9a ) are accompanied by two blue bac features each separated by -30 kms@xmath4 .",
    "the middle absorption component of these is absent in any other lines in our spectra .",
    "an important difference between the 5018   ( 2.9ev ) and its slightly stronger multiplet members 4923   and 5169   is that that the 5018   line exhibits a broad absorption wing .",
    "the red wings of the other two lines reach the continuum abruptly and hint at the presence of red emission .",
    "this trend continues as one goes to less strong feii lines , such as 5276   and especially 5272   ( see fig.7 ; lower spectrum ) .",
    "the latter are somewhat filled in by emission , according to the pure - absorption models that fit most of our other weaker feii line absorptions well . yet weaker but still fairly strong lines arise from the same excitation potential ; fig.10a shows this emission for 5169   and also in the red wing of the mgi 5172   line . tracing these characteristics altogether , from the intermediate - strength feii lines to the lines of the more abundant ions mgi and siii ,",
    "there is a trend that the lines with the highest optical depth exhibit the greatest tendency for the  main \" red component to be filled in by emission .",
    "this is the typical signature of pcygni emission in an outflow with only a small expansion velocity .",
    "the emission originates from scattering of line flux from a large annular region in the sky plane around the star ( though primarily along the disk axis ) .",
    "this conclusion is required by the required coverage factor of many stellar - areas to model the metallic line emissions in our circus models ( see figs.8b , 9b , 10a ) .",
    "these models demonstrate that the emission is too large to be caused by gas heating along lines of sight directly to the star .",
    "although the bacs are a highlight of   optical spectrum , they are not unique to this star . in a little noted paper , heydari - meydari ( 1990 ) reported that the metallic absorption lines of the sgb[e ] star n82 for the most part consist of double components , the dominant member of which is blueshifted by about -46 kms@xmath4 .",
    "in addition , we notice a faint vestige of bacs at the same velocity also seem to be present in the mgii 4128 , 4132   doublet in the   spectrum - see fig.10b .",
    "these similarities prompt the speculation that our program stars are part of a larger group - we call them  bgbe stars . \"",
    "such stars must have extensive and kinematically complicated ( but slowly expanding ) disks in the central plane in which either high turbulence or colliding wind components are common .",
    "if so , they may form a morphological if not evolutionary bridge between sgb[e ] and classical be stars .      as noted in @xmath384.2.1 ,",
    "the measured radial velocities are practically the same from our high resolution uves and mike spectra obtained in 2001 and 2007 .",
    "the roughly constant wavelength spacing between the absorption components in nad ( one is the galactic ism component ) suggests that there is little or no change in rv in the reference frame of the outer regions of the cs disk between our two observing epochs .",
    "one of the conclusions from the absence of clear rv changes is that short - period binarity is unlikely .",
    "second , we see almost no difference in the high level hydrogen or metallic line strengths of   between the 2001 and 2007 spectra . for there are only subtle differences in the line profiles . among these",
    "are : ( 1 ) the h@xmath37 emission is slightly weaker ; the @xmath23 ratio , now @xmath391 , is reversed , but still is close to one , and ( 2 ) the multiple components in the strongest feii and nad lines are sharper in the 2007 spectra .",
    "thus , while the details of the wind flow are slightly different , the general slow outflow characteristics are the same . for   the new spectra show several blue feii lines that were not so clear before , and the generally sharper bac components bring out the emission .",
    "two of these are feii 4585   and 4632 ; the  main \" ( red ) component shows very clear pcygni - like structure , which we could barely discern in the 2001 spectra .",
    "the 2007 spectra also cover the blue region of the caii h / k lines , which were not included in the 2001 uves observations .",
    "this doublet exhibits developed wings . while the line cores do not reach the zero flux level , like the d lines they are deep enough to suggest that a putative cooler companion could not contribute much flux in the blue spectral region .",

    "in order to interpret the variability and spectral characteristics observed in our targets , in principle we can invoke mass loss / exchange in a binary system with two nearly equal mass components .",
    "however , we have rejected this hypothesis because of the unmeasurable changes in rv , small departures from strictly periodic variability in the light curve , and the absence of a secondary component in the hydrogen and resonance line spectra .",
    "rather , to date the evidence supports the view that these objects are effectively single stars surrounded by a slowly expanding disk which is fed by a moderate velocity wind close to the star .",
    "the chances of our intitially selecting two stars with unexpectedly anomalous spectra out of a group of eight otherwise normal b stars are very low .",
    "therefore , we suspect that the bgbe stars are comparatively numerous in the smc fields s02 surveyed , perhaps accounting for at least 10% of all the type3 b variables down to @xmath13 = 14 .",
    "even so , somehow these objects certainly represent a short - lived stage in the evolution of ob type stars in at least the smc .",
    "the most striking spectroscopic characteristic of these objects is their confined thick disks , which seem to be tied to winds . although we do not yet know whether , like many b[e ] stars , these cs systems have a hybrid nature , it is tempting from our observations to speculate that the wind has both a slow and moderate or fast velocity component along the same sight lines . in this context ,",
    "madura et al . (",
    "2007 ) have discussed b[e ] wind models in which a fast wind solution abruptly develops a  kink , \" quickly transitioning to a slow component .",
    "the kink solution is due in part to the rapid rotation of the star .",
    "rapid rotation could have been initiated either after pre - main sequence evolution ( an oft - advanced picture for classical be stars ) , from spin - ups via intra - binary mass transfer from a now evolved companion ( like @xmath40per ) , or from spin - up during a blue loop phase of late ( single - star ) stellar evolution , as sometimes posited for sgb[e ] variables ( langer & heger 1998 ) .",
    "the evidence does not rule out any of the three scenarios , although the case for mass transfer in a massive close binary ( i.e. , with an orbital radius less than than a few a.u . )",
    "so far seems the weakest .",
    "regardless of how the bgbe stars evolve to the early b ( roughly ) class ii - iii region of the hr diagram , fundamental questions remain concerning a clearly complicated geometrical and kinematical structure . in global terms",
    ", the disk must be an equatorially confined disk with a possible , nonaxisymmetric component , which undergoes keplerian rotation and a small outward outflow component near this plane . in this last sense",
    ", the  disk \" seems to be closely tied to a slow wind , probably even slower in velocity than the slow equatorial winds of sgb[e ] stars . in this one sense , the disk has intermediate kinematic properties between the keplerian disks of be stars and slowly expanding disk / winds of sgb[e ] variables .",
    "we may summarize the evidence that the structure around the bgbe stars in this study are disks from the following observations :    * the double - peaked @xmath13 , @xmath41 emissions of the peak in h@xmath24 and other lower members of the lower balmer sequence .",
    "this is a key signature of keplerian rotation in equatorially confined disks , as seen by an observer viewing the system at an intermediate or edge - on angle . * the reversal of the @xmath13 , @xmath41 emissions on a timescale of a few years",
    "is likewise associated with be - like disks .",
    "* the half - power emission peaks of the lines are broader as one moves up balmer lines from h@xmath24 .",
    "this too is the hallmark of keplerian rotation in be stars .",
    "the larger emission widths result from a lower opacity in the high level lines , thereby sampling a larger equatorial rate closer to the star . *",
    "the presence of emission centered nearly in the wavelength frame of the primary cs absorptions is consistent with keplerian motion .",
    "* the nearly periodic variations of the light curve strongly suggest recurrent occultations by a structure in the plane .    at the same time",
    ", there is evidence that the disk is actually part of a very slow equatorial wind or outflow :    1 .",
    "strong lines such as the wings of the balmer and paschen lines , and in addition the nad lines , exhibit a slight strengthening of the blue wing , which is consistent with an accelerating flow , at least in some sight lines to the star .",
    "the cores of the h@xmath24 are shifted to the blue by 7 - 8 kms@xmath4 relative to h@xmath42 ( table6 ) .",
    "this puts a strong lower limit to an outflow velocity to the more superficial disk formation sites for h@xmath24 relative to the other lines .",
    "3 .   in the metallic lines of ,",
    "the redshifted emission in the siii 6347   and 6371   doublet , some strong feii and mgi lines demonstrates a small blueshift in the  main \" absorption component .",
    "in fact , the description of these cs structures are much more complicated than merely of a slowly outflowing axisymmetric disk .",
    "most of s spectral lines exhibit one or even two  bacs , \" which beg an interpretation of collisions of a comparatively rapid outflowing gas with a more leisurely expanding disk .",
    "indeed , the radial velocities of the bac components are similar to those of the hei lines , suggesting this component accelerates freely from the star s equatorial regions over a short distance ( probably @xmath28r@xmath43 ) before encountering the disk .",
    "we speculate this outflow maintains the disk mass as it expands from the star . from fig.10b",
    ", it appears that bacs are present in the   spectrum too .",
    "their weaker appearance could be caused by a number of factors , among them simply a less massive flow .",
    "however , we suspect the primary factor is that the inner flow is less visible if our viewing angle to this star is more edge - on and we can not see the inner disk interactions as clearly .",
    "this would be in agreement with the smaller h@xmath24 emission , which is a function of projected area , the larger @xmath44 , and also the similar ir re - emission ( from optically thin gas and/or warm dust ) with respect to .",
    "the broad symmetrical emission or absorption wings in the spectral lines of   require a separate description - indeed one that can not be said to be unique because there are many ways of generating turbulence .",
    "however , one can gain a start in understanding this by noting that a turbulence of at least 50 kms@xmath4 hints at a source with a considerably higher kinetic energy .",
    "the most plausible source is of a high - velocity wind , which abrades the central disk plane as it flows across it .",
    "this explanation would likewise explain symmetrical emission due to scattered flux from gas from beyond the stars limbs .",
    "this explanation carries the prediction that a high - velocity wind is present . in this event , tapered blue wings should be visible in the wind - sensitive resonance lines in the ultraviolet .",
    "we would further predict that the strengthening of these wings would be slight because lines of sight only intersecting the most visible  upper \" limb of the star would sample the high latitude wind .",
    "this latter point brings up the important point that in the envisaged disk geometry , including the kraus & lamers opening disks , any observer at equatorial or intermediate viewing angles can expect , through different lines of sight , can expect to sample contributions from strata having different ionizations and velocities .",
    "in particular , sight lines intersecting the star s visible pole and equator will tend to run along streams having high and low velocities ( and ionizations ) , respectively .",
    "this may account for the variety of components along the nad and balmer line profiles that are unlikely be caused by local ism absorption , particularly for   ( see fig.4a ) .",
    "this might also well explain why the strongest broadenings are seen in metallic lines arising from intermediate and high excitations , such as the siii 6347 , 6371   doublet and the infrared oi triplet . in summary ,",
    "the wind / disk systems are difficult to reconcile with simple pictures of either : ( 1 ) line forming temperatures decreasing radially outward , or ( 2 ) an opening disk , as computed by kraus & lamers ( 2003 ) , with ionization contours streaming radially outward .",
    "the evidence supports a picture with components of both these geometries .",
    "however , in our opinion the second picture probably is most consistent with the correlation of broadening of single absorption components with excitation potential .",
    "in addition to the complex geometrical and kinematical description , the spatial distribution of the disks of   and   offers surprises with respect to the classical be and the sgb[e ] groups .",
    "consider first that forbidden emission lines are a defining attribute of b[e ] and especially sgb[e ] stars , and yet they are unobserved in these stars .",
    "this suggests , despite their large column density of some 10@xmath32 @xmath26 , and a likely typical density of 10@xmath19 @xmath20 , is needed to permit @xmath45 to attain @xmath29 1 and thus be visible . ]",
    "that the disk does not extend to the lower densities ( @xmath2810@xmath46 @xmath20 ) , that favor forbidden line formation .",
    "consider further the relatively modest infrared excess for these stars of @xmath21.7 magnitudes .",
    "this is relatively modest by standards of b[e ] stars , although it still falls within the sgb[e ] distribution for these excesses .    in all , the disks of the bgbe s are as thick and extensive in radius , enough be visible in h@xmath24 out to 10 s of or even 100 stellar radii .",
    "however , the evidence from the absence of [ fe ] emission and only moderate ir emission suggests that the disk extents are limited and perhaps suddenly truncated , such they do not show these expected additional traits .",
    "one wonders what mechanism could truncate an otherwise continuing gentle fall off in disk density with distance . as speculation ,",
    "one possibility is a truncation occurs at the lagrangian point in a widely spaced binary system , particularly if the putative companion has a low mass . in this case , assuming a disk of extent 100r@xmath47 ( and thus an orbital radius of @xmath295a.u . ) , a circular orbit viewed even edge - on would imply a radial velocity semi - amplitude of only a few kms@xmath4 .",
    "thus , a small rv variation in a hypothetically wide spaced system could well be undetectable for a small phase difference of @xmath280.2 cycles .",
    "an even more puzzling attribute of these disks is the modulation of starlight as a large condensation occulting the star once per orbit .",
    "this hypothesis presents itself largely through the exclusion of eclipsing binarity , which is untenable for several reasons , the improbability of observing 2 out of 2 widely spaced systems in eclipse being among them .",
    "in this paper we have investigated two photometrically variable smc blue stars , viz .   and .",
    "these stars show rather exotic properties , such as cs absorption / emission lines , continuum reddening , an almost complete absence of photospheric lines , the presence of blue discrete absorption components ( bacs ) mostly in metallic lines , _ and _ the absence of forbidden emission lines .",
    "we modeled fuv and high resolution optical lines with synspec and circus spectral synthesis codes finding that the spectra can be interpreted in terms of an optically thick slowly expanding and temperature - stratified wind / disk star surrounding both stars .",
    "we interpreted discrete blue absorption components (  bacs \" ) as evidence of a velocity discontinuity in the outward flow of matter from the star , or more precisely as evidence for weak shocks formed at the interface between a freely accelerating zone close to the star and a very slowly expanding , flattened disk just beyond it .",
    "we take this outer disk to be a relatively dense quasi - keplerian structure that is the source of h@xmath37 emission and the rich metallic line spectrum .",
    "we note a key feature , without being able to resolve why , and probably integral to their discovery , that the disks may not be axisymmetric .",
    "nonaxisymmetric density bulges are reminiscent of the periodic migration of one armed density waves , which are excited in the be disks of many classical be stars ( okazaki 1991 ) .",
    "the appearances of these disk features manifest themselves as periodic oscillations of the ratio @xmath23 in h@xmath24 emission features in the be stars . in light of the reversal of this ratio between 2001 and 2007 for one of our program objects , one might suspect that the ratios oscillate over time .",
    "it is probably premature yet to suggest that this or other alternative disk instability is responsible for the almost periodic light curves until one can associate the light curve variations more closely with disk properties .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that this association could be accomplished by monitoring the @xmath23 ratio in h@xmath24 in these stars for the predicted variations over the next several years .",
    "although these objects are similar in some respects to sgb[e ] stars , the program objects are unique kinds of be stars by being less luminous than them and by displaying no forbidden emission lines in their spectra .",
    "additionally , they have disks that are optically thick to many lines .",
    "they are also likely to have inhomogeneities which cause nearly periodic long variations in optical brightness .",
    "we speculate that these two objects are prototypes of a new type of variable - we have named them bgbe stars - with luminosities midway between sgb[e ] and be stars . although the bgbe stars are probably not close binary systems , their membership in wide binaries with periods of a few years or longer , can not be ruled out .",
    "wide binarity may even be favored to explain the absence of forbidden lines .    to shed light on these new bgbe stars , optical spectroscopy is needed on other candidate objects discovered in our surveys of the clouds . on the basis of extant lower quality spectra",
    ", we find at least three other stars in the lmc with properties similar to our two prototype objects .",
    "these are ogle05155332 - 6925581 , ogle05141821 - 6912350 , and ogle00552027 - 7237101 . these spectra display moderate to strong h@xmath37 emission profiles , high level balmer absorption lines and variable ( possibly regular ) light curves . although the resolution of these moderate - dispersion spectra is insufficient to see faint emissions , none of the spectra show strong forbidden emission lines of feii .",
    "the spectrum of the first of these is particularly interesting in that it shows bacs , and yet is a doubly periodic variable ( mennickent et al .",
    "2003 , mennickent et al .",
    "2008 ) . because this object does not have a noticeable ir excess",
    ", its membership in a close binary could be important .",
    "follow up observations of these and similar objects are ongoing and will help resolve such questions as the general prevalence of the bgbe class , the dependence of their properties on metallicity and , for those members with thinner disks , their rotational velocities .",
    "similarly , the observation of uv resonance lines of these objects , so far lacking in these objects , will elucidate the geometrical structure of their winds and perhaps allow the discovery of a high - velocity component .",
