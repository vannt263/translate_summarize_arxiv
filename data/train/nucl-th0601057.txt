    "in many pion induced reactions on the nucleon , the single pion production reaction @xmath0 has been studied with a particular interest due to its role as a major inelastic process .",

    "we found that the @xmath19 reactions are sensitive to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 interactions , and could be a source of information of their coupling constants .    besides being useful for clarifying the properties of @xmath2 ,",

    "( iii ) the @xmath9 invariant mass distributions shows a large asymmetric shape in population of the events , i.e. the peak at large value of @xmath33 is larger than that at small value of @xmath33 .",
    "when the total energy increases , the correlation between the outgoing pions will become visible .",
    "the scalar - isoscalar correlation of two pions via the @xmath21 decay is particularly interesting , because such correlation may generate the @xmath8 meson pole . in view of the sizable contribution of @xmath21 ,",
    "the @xmath0 reaction is a possible source of information about this controversial scalar meson .",
