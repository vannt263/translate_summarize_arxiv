    "the stimulus - response relationship of neuronal systems is of focusing interest in neuroscience @xcite .",
    "whereas the dynamical responses of a single neuron to various kinds of stimuli have been well explored and documented @xcite , the stimulus - response relationship for complex neuronal systems made up of an ensemble of coupled neurons remains an open question @xcite .",
    "this is particularly the case for the excitability of coupled neuronal systems when subjected to external stimulating currents , where the bifurcation diagram of a single neuron has been well explored in both experiment and theory , yet the corresponding picture for complex neuronal systems is still not clear . for a single neuron , as the intensity of the stimulating current increases , it is widely observed that the neuron dynamics typically will undergo two bifurcations : the transition from the polarized - resting to firing states ( at a smaller critical intensity named firing threshold ) , and the transition from the firing to depolarized - resting states ( at a larger critical intensity named depolarization - block threshold ) @xcite .",
    "however , for the coupled neuronal systems , e.g. , the complex neuronal networks , despite the experimental efforts made in the past decade , it remain unknown whether such transitions still exist and , more importantly , how the transitions are influenced by the neuron couplings @xcite .",
    "the excitability of complex neuronal systems is fundamentally different from that of isolated neuron , due to the neuron couplings @xcite .",
    "when coupled together , the excitability of a neuron is jointed determined by the external stimulus and the coupling signals it receives from the connected neurons . as such , the bifurcation thresholds mentioned above , namely the firing and depolarization - block thresholds , will be _ dependent _ on also the strength of the neuron couplings @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , adapting to the neuronal activities , the neuron coupling strength could be varying with time , i.e. , the plasticity feature of the neuron synapses ( junctions ) @xcite . therefore , even for the same neuronal system , the bifurcation thresholds might be different when measured under different physiological conditions . besides the aspect of coupling strength , the excitability of complex neuronal systems is also crucially affected by the coupling relationship ( structure ) among the neurons .",
    "modern studies of brain connectome have revealed that neuronal systems are more properly described by complex networks @xcite , where neurons and synapses are represented as nodes and links , respectively . instead of random connections ,",
    "the neuronal networks are well structured and possess distinct topological properties , e.g. , the heterogenous degree distribution @xcite , the community and modular structures @xcite , the hierarchical organization @xcite , etc .",
    "in particular , in neuronal networks there are a few neurons of very large degrees ( the number of connections of a neuron ) , which , comparing to the majority of neurons having smaller degrees , are more crucial to the system functionalities @xcite . as such",
    ", the excitability of neuronal networks will be also affected by the location ( node ) where the stimulus is added .",
    "experiments aside , insights into the excitability of complex neuronal networks could be firstly gained by modeling studies .",
    "inspired by this , in the present work we investigate theoretically how complex network of coupled neurons is responded to external stimulus , with special attentions being paid to the dependence of network excitability on the stimulating intensity and neuron coupling strength .",
    "more specifically , we stimulate only a single node , i.e. , the largest - degree node , in a heterogenous complex network , and investigate how the network firing thresholds are varying with the stimulating intensity and neuron coupling strength .",
    "our main finding is that , by stimulating just a single node , the whole network can still be successfully evoked when the stimulating intensity is within a bounded region in the parameter space ( the interval between the firing and depolarization - block thresholds ) ; and , with the variation of the neuron coupling strength , the range of this firing region could be significantly modified , e.g. , the firing region is separated into disconnected subregions under weak couplings .",
    "our studies show clearly the existence of both two firing thresholds in complex neuronal networks and , more importantly , point out the dependence of the firing thresholds on the neuron couplings .",
    "our model of networked neurons reads @xmath0 with @xmath1 the neuron ( node ) indices , @xmath2 the state vector of the @xmath3th neuron , and @xmath4 the uniform coupling strength .",

    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , in the ml model we set the parameters @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 .",
    "with such a setting , a single neuron will be staying on the firing states when the intensity of the stimulating current is within the range @xmath40 , with @xmath41 ( the firing threshold ) and @xmath42 ( the depolarization - block threshold ) ; while for @xmath43 or @xmath44 , the neuron will be staying on the resting states @xcite .",
    "the key question we are going to address in the present work is : _ is such a firing region still existing for complex network of coupled neurons ? and , if yes , how is this firing range affected by the neuron coupling strength ? _    to capture the heterogenous feature of the neuronal networks , we adopt the generalized barabsi - albert ( ba ) algorithm to construct the network structure @xcite .",
    "specifically , starting from a small - size nucleus of @xmath45 globally connected nodes , at each time step of the network growth a new node is introduced and is connected to @xmath46 of the existing nodes by the probability @xmath47 , with @xmath3 and @xmath10 the node indices and @xmath48 the degree of node @xmath3 ( i.e. , the mechanism of preferential link attachment ) .",

    ", the network will settle to the resting state after a short transient . in our studies , we shall stimulate only the largest - degree node by injecting on it a direct current of intensity @xmath28 , and analyze the bifurcation diagram of the network dynamics in the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath55 .",
    "we start by exploring the variation of the network excitability with respect to the stimulating intensity , while keeping the coupling strength fixed as @xmath56 . setting @xmath57 , we plot in fig .",
    "1(a ) the spatiotemporal evolution of the network after a transient period of @xmath58 .",
    "it is seen that all the neurons , including the largest - degree one , are of steady membrane potentials , indicating that the network is completely resting .",
    "increasing @xmath28 to @xmath59 , in fig .",
    "1(b ) it is seen that all the neurons are firing in a synchronous fashion , i.e. , the whole network is evoked .",
    "we thus infer from figs . 1 ( a ) and ( b ) that , despite the high - dimensional dynamics , complex neuronal network can still be evoked by stimulating a single neuron ; and , in analogy with the excitability of a single neuron , there also exists a firing threshold beyond which the network can be evoked .",
    "this triggers our interest of finding the depolarization - block threshold by increasing @xmath28 further .",
    "1(c ) shows the network evolution for @xmath60 .",
    "it is seen that the network is partially evoked , i.e. , some of the neurons are ceased from oscillations , while the others remain firing .",
    "increasing @xmath28 further to @xmath61 [ fig .",
    "1(d ) ] , it is shown that all the neurons are ceased , and the network restores to the completely resting state similar to fig .",
    "indeed , the depolarization - block threshold is observed . here , to distinguish from the situation of isolated neuron",
    ", we use @xmath62 and @xmath63 to denote , respectively , the firing and depolarization - block thresholds of the neuronal network .    to have more details on the transition of the network dynamics with respect to @xmath28 , we plot in fig .",
    "1(e ) the number of firing neurons , @xmath64 , as a function of @xmath28 . here , neurons are identified as firing if their membrane potentials are oscillating with amplitudes larger than @xmath65 ( so as to exclude the situations of subcritical and passive oscillations ) . as depicted in fig .",
    "1(e ) , as @xmath28 increases from 0 , the value of @xmath64 is firstly jumped from 0 ( resting network ) to @xmath66 ( completely firing network ) at @xmath67 ; then , during the interval @xmath68 , @xmath64 is staying at @xmath66 ; after that , @xmath64 is gradually decreased , and reaches 0 at @xmath69 .",
    "the transition scenario of the network dynamics therefore can be described as : resting @xmath70 complete - firing @xmath70 partial - firing @xmath70 resting , and the firing region of the network ( including both the complete- and partial - firing states ) is identified as @xmath71 .",
    "we continue to explore the influence of the neuron coupling strength , @xmath4 , on the network excitability . fixing the stimulating intensity as @xmath72 , we plot in figs .",
    "1(f - i ) the network evolutions under different coupling strengths .",
    "it is straightforward to see that when the coupling is absent ( @xmath73 ) , the network will be at resting , since @xmath74 for the largest - degree neuron and @xmath75 for the others . by the weak coupling @xmath76 , fig .",
    "1(f ) shows that the network is still at resting ; increasing @xmath4 to @xmath46 , the network is partially evoked [ fig .",
    "1(g ) ] ; when @xmath77 , the network is completely evoked [ fig .",
    "1(h ) ] ; increasing @xmath4 further to @xmath78 , the network restores to the resting state [ fig .",
    "1(i ) ] . again , we observe the transition from the resting to firing and then to the resting states .",
    "more details about the transition can be found in fig .",
    "1(j ) , where the number of the firing neurons , @xmath64 , is plotted as a function of @xmath4 . fig .",
    "1(j ) shows that the network is evoked ( partially or completely ) in the region @xmath79 , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "clearly , the network excitability is also influenced by the neuron coupling strength .    .",
    "as @xmath4 increases from @xmath82 , the firing ( depolarization - block ) threshold , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , is monotonically increased ( decreased ) , rendering the firing region ( regions i and ii ) being gradually narrowed . for @xmath83 , the firing region",
    "is separated into two branches by an embedded resting  tongue \" .",

    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "2 . now , the influence of the neuron coupling strength on the network excitability can be systematically analyzed .",
    "when the coupling is strong ( @xmath86 ) , it is seen that with the increase of @xmath4 , the firing ( depolarization - block ) threshold , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , is monotonically increased ( decreased ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the firing region is gradually narrowed with the increase of @xmath4 . a close look to the firing region",
    "also shows that with the increase of @xmath4 , the region of complete firing ( region ii in fig .",
    "2 ) is gradually expanded . when the coupling is weak ( @xmath83 ) , the variation of the firing region is significantly different from that of strong couplings , and shows some intriguing features .",
    "firstly , the firing region is separated into two disconnected subregions by an embedded  tongue \" of resting states . as such , with the increase of @xmath28 , the network will be transiting twice from the resting to firing states , instead of once as for the case of strong couplings .",
    "secondly , in contrast to the situation of strong couplings where @xmath62 is monotonically increased with @xmath4 , here it is seen that @xmath62 is monotonically decreased as @xmath4 increases .",
    "finally , an overflowing region is appeared in the bottom - right corner of the parameter space ( region iv in fig .",
    "2 ) . as a result of this",
    ", the network will be transited from the firing to overflowing states at large @xmath28 , instead of restoring to the resting state as for the case of strong couplings .",
    "how could complex neuronal network be evoked by stimulated only a single neuron , and why the firing region is modulated by the coupling strength in such a fashion ?",
    "in particular , why the firing region is separated into disconnected subregions at weak couplings , while is continuously distributed at strong couplings ? to answer these questions , we next employ a simplified model to explore the underlying mechanisms of the modified network excitability induced by varying the neuron coupling strength .",
    "st node which has degree @xmath87 .",
    "( b ) the bifurcation diagram in the parameter space @xmath55 .",
    "regions i , ii , and iii represent , respectively , the partial - firing , complete - firing , and resting states .",
    "the firing region is separated into three disconnected subregions in the region of @xmath88 ( the magenta dotted line ) . fixing the stimulating intensity as @xmath89 , the time evolution of the coupling signal that neuron 2 receives from neuron 1 , @xmath90 , under different coupling strengths : ( c ) @xmath91 ( steady ) ; ( d ) @xmath77 ( oscillatory ) . ]    the new network structure is presented in fig .",
    "3(a ) , which contains @xmath92 nodes and @xmath93 links . stimulating the @xmath94st neuron ( the largest - degree node ) ,",
    "we investigate again the bifurcation diagram of the network dynamics in the parameter space @xmath55 .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "it is seen that , despite the simplified network model , fig .",
    "3(b ) reproduces the main features shown in fig .",
    "2 . to be specific , the firing region",
    "is gradually narrowed as @xmath4 increases from @xmath95 , while is separated into three disconnected subregions for @xmath96 .",
    "the similarity between figs .",
    "2 and 3 renders the simplified model a suitable candidate for exploring the dynamical mechanisms of the modified network excitability .    as only the largest - degree neuron",
    "is stimulated , the other neurons in the network therefore are evoked by their nearest neighbors through the couplings .",
    "taking neuron 2 in fig .",
    "3(a ) as an example , the coupling signal that it receives from neuron 1 is @xmath97 ( according to the coupling function ) .",
    "assuming the network is at resting , @xmath90 will be a constant , which is essentially a direct current as the one injected on neuron @xmath94 .",
    "3(c ) shows the case for @xmath89 and @xmath91 , where @xmath90 is fixed at @xmath98 during the system evolution .",
    "as @xmath4 increases , the coupling current will be gradually increased and , once @xmath90 exceeds @xmath99 ( the firing threshold for isolated neuron ) , neuron 2 could be fired . in this case , @xmath90 will be oscillating with time , as depicted in fig .",
    "3(d ) for the case of @xmath89 and @xmath77 .",
    "neuron @xmath94 , in turn , might be evoked by the feedback coupling , @xmath100 , given the total current it receives [ including the stimulus @xmath28 , the feedback couplings @xmath100 ( from neuron 2 ) and @xmath101 ( from neuron 3 ) ] is within the firing region @xmath102 . in the similar way , the other neurons in the network could be also evoked by the coupling currents , resulting in the complete firing of the network .",
    "the above analysis thus suggests that in evoking the networked neurons , the coupling currents , @xmath103 , play essentially the same role as the stimulating current , @xmath28 . regarding this , we unify the coupling and stimulating currents by introducing the new quantity of effective stimulus @xmath104 if @xmath105 is oscillating with time , we characterize it by its time - average @xmath106 and oscillating amplitude @xmath107 . now ,",
    "whether neuron @xmath3 is resting or firing is solely determined by the integrated signal @xmath105 , regardless of the details of the stimulus ( e.g. , the stimulating intensity ) and couplings ( e.g. , the set of neighboring nodes ) . moreover , with the introduction of effective stimulus , the complex network can be treated effectively as an ensemble of _ isolated _ neurons subjected to different effective stimuli . as we shall show in the following , this technique of neuron decoupling is very favorable in analyzing the firing mechanisms of complex neuronal networks .    with the help of effective stimulus , we now revisit , from a different viewpoint , the influences of @xmath28 and @xmath4 on the network excitability .",
    "fixing @xmath77 , we plot in fig .",
    "4(a ) the variations of @xmath105 as a function of @xmath28 for all 5 neurons in the network .",
    "interestingly , it is seen that with the increase of @xmath28 , the effective stimuli are _ shifted up _ globally .",
    "specifically , the effective stimuli are monotonically increased and crossing the firing region @xmath102 in sequence ( @xmath108 ) . another interesting phenomenon observed in fig .",
    "4(a ) is that a neuron is firing only when its effective stimulus is overlapping with the firing region . to have more details on the connection between the network dynamics and the effective stimuli , we plot in figs .",
    "4(b - e ) the distributions of @xmath105 for some typical values of @xmath28 . for @xmath109 [ fig .",
    "4(b ) ] , the effective stimuli are constants and below the firing threshold @xmath99 , while a check of the neuron dynamics shows that the network is at resting . for @xmath89 [ fig .",
    "4(c ) ] , the effective stimuli are oscillating and overlapping with the firing region . by checking the neuron dynamics , it is found that the network is completely fired . increasing @xmath28 to @xmath110 [ fig .",
    "4(d ) ] , @xmath111 are larger than the depolarization - block threshold @xmath112 , while @xmath113 are still overlapping with the firing region . in this case , only neurons @xmath93 and @xmath92 are fired , and , as a consequence , the network is partially evoked . increasing @xmath28 further to @xmath114 [ fig .",
    "4(e ) ] , all the effective stimuli become constants and are larger than @xmath112 , and the network is restored to the resting state similar to fig .",
    "the role of @xmath28 in evoking the network now can be understood : it increases the effective stimuli of all the neurons , making them crossing the firing region , @xmath102 , in sequence .",
    "we finally analyze the influence of the coupling strength on network excitability .",
    "fixing @xmath89 , we plot in fig .",
    "4(f ) the variations of the effective stimuli , @xmath105 , as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "different from the situation of increasing @xmath28 [ fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , it is seen that as @xmath4 increases , the effective stimuli are _ drawn closer_. to be specific , with the increase of @xmath4 , @xmath115 is quickly decreased from above @xmath112 to below @xmath99 , while , in the meantime , @xmath116 are slowly increased and approaching @xmath99 . to have more details about the transition , we plot in figs .",
    "4(g - j ) the distribution of @xmath105 for different values of @xmath4 . for the weak coupling @xmath76 [ fig .",
    "4(g ) ] , a distinct gap is observed between @xmath115 and @xmath116 , with @xmath117 and @xmath118 . in this case , as all the effective stimuli are outside of the firing region , no neuron is firing and the network is completely resting . increasing @xmath4 to @xmath119 [ fig .",
    "4(h ) ] , @xmath115 is decreased while @xmath116 are increased , making the gap between them narrowed .",
    "moreover , the oscillations of @xmath111 are overlapping with the firing region , while @xmath113 are not . in this case",
    ", neurons @xmath94 , @xmath46 and @xmath120 are firing , making the network partially fired .",
    "increasing @xmath4 to @xmath121 [ fig .",
    "4(i ) ] , the gap between @xmath115 and @xmath116 is further narrowed , and all the effective stimuli are overlapping with the firing region . in this case , the network is completely evoked . increasing @xmath4 further to @xmath122 [ fig .",
    "4(j ) ] , the effective stimuli have approximately the same value , i.e. , @xmath123 , and all are smaller to @xmath99 . in this case , all neurons are ceased from oscillations and the network is restored to the resting state .",
    "the role of @xmath4 in evoking the neuronal network thus can be also understood : it reduces the difference between the effective stimuli ( especially the gap between the stimulated and non - stimulated neurons ) , drawing them to the uniform distribution .",
    "having revealed the individual influence of @xmath28 and @xmath4 on the network excitability , the bifurcation diagrams shown in figs . 2 and 3(b )",
    "now can be interpreted , as follows .",
    "firstly , for the fixed coupling strength , the firing ( depolarization - block ) threshold , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , is determined by the maximum ( minimum ) effective stimulus , @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) . for the simplified model , we have @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "when @xmath28 is small , @xmath128 for all neurons and the network is at resting . as @xmath28 increases",
    ", @xmath129 will be increased altogether without changing their order [ fig .",
    "4(a ) ] , and , once @xmath130 exceeds @xmath99 , neuron 1 will be fired . as a consequence , the network is transited from the resting to ( partially ) firing states .",
    "increasing @xmath28 further , @xmath105 will be entering and then escaping from the firing region in sequence , and , once @xmath131 crosses @xmath112 , the network will be transited from the firing to resting states . as such , we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 . secondly , with the increase of @xmath4 , @xmath115 ( @xmath131 )",
    "will be decreased monotonically ( increased ) [ as depicted in fig .",
    "4(f ) ] . now , to make @xmath115 ( @xmath134 cross @xmath99 ( @xmath112 ) , a larger ( smaller ) @xmath28 therefore will be needed , resulting in the increased ( decreased ) @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "this explains the behavior of the firing region under strong couplings in the bifurcation diagrams .",
    "thirdly , when the couplings are weak , the effective stimuli are widely spread [ as shown in fig .",
    "4(g ) ] . in particular",
    ", the gap between @xmath115 and @xmath135 could be wider than the firing range @xmath102 .",
    "in such a case , with the increase of @xmath28 , there would be the situation where @xmath117 while @xmath118 . as a result , a resting  tongue \" , started from the point @xmath136 and ended at the point @xmath137 , will be appeared inside the firing region .",
    "this explains why under weak couplings the firing region is made up of disconnected subregions in the bifurcation diagrams [ figs . 2 and 3(b ) ] .",
    "if more than one large gaps ( of width larger than the firing range ) exist in the spectrum of the effective stimuli , more resting  tongues \" will be observed .",
    "for instance , when the coupling is weak ( e.g. , @xmath138 ) , the gap between @xmath139 and @xmath131 in the simplified model will be also wider than the firing range , resulting in the @xmath46nd resting  tongue \" in the bifurcation diagram [ see the lower part of fig .",
    "this understanding is confirmed by numerical simulations , which show that in the left ( middle , right ) subregion , only neuron 1 [ ( 2,3,4 ) , 5 ] is fired .",
    "based on this understanding , we can also predict that in the bottom - left corner of fig .",
    "2 , there will exist some unique states where only the largest - degree neuron is fired . by scanning this corner with the improved precision , these special states",
    "are indeed observed , e.g. , when @xmath140 and @xmath141 , only neuron @xmath94 is fired in the network .",
    "increases from @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) , and is separated into disconnected subregions in the region @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "the ( magenta ) dotted lines denote the critical coupling strengths @xmath84 and @xmath85 . ]",
    "similar phenomena have been also observed for other network structures .",
    "5(a ) shows the bifurcation diagram for the erds - rnyi ( er ) random network @xcite , which is constructed by connecting the existing neurons with an equal probability .",
    "the size and the number of links of the er network are identical to that of the ba network used in fig . 2 , but the degrees are more homogeneously distributed .",
    "still , the external stimulus is only injected on the largest - degree neuron ( of degree @xmath146 ) .",
    "similar to figs . 2 and 3(b ) , it is observed in fig .",
    "5(a ) that in the region of strong couplings ( @xmath147 ) , the firing region is gradually enlarged as @xmath4 decreases ; while in the region of weak couplings ( @xmath144 ) the firing region is separated into two disconnected subregions . fig .",
    "5(b ) shows the bifurcation diagram for the small - world ( sw ) network @xcite , which is constructed by rewiring randomly the connections of a regular network with the probability @xmath148 .",
    "again , it is seen that in the strong - coupling region ( @xmath149 ) the firing region is gradually enlarged as @xmath4 decreases , while in the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath145 ) the firing region is separated into two disconnected subregions .",
    "the present work is inspired by the series of experimental results reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , where it is observed that the firing behaviors of the somatosensory cortex @xcite , or even the global brain @xcite , could be significantly modulated by stimulating a single or a few neurons in vivo . for illustration purpose ,",
    "we have chosen to stimulate only the largest - degree neuron in the network , yet it should be noted that the phenomena ( and the firing mechanisms ) we have observed ( revealed ) are general and independent of the stimulating location .",
    "for instance , the main features of the bifurcation diagram presented in fig . 2 are still kept if the stimulus is injected on a neuron of medium degree ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in the realistic brain network , a functional area is normally stimulated by a number of inputs at different locations , e.g. , the rhythm signals received from the suprachiasmatic nucleus ( scn ) @xcite .",
    "in such a case , the network excitability will be also dependent of the stimulating strategy , i.e. , the spatial configuration of the stimulus , and the bifurcation diagram might be significantly changed by adopting different stimulating strategies .",
    "a detail study to this question is out of the scope of the present work , which , hopefully , would be addressed elsewhere .    to summarize",
    ", we have studied the dynamical responses of complex neuronal networks subjected to a single stimulus , and found that the network could be evoked when the stimulating intensity is within a bounded region in the parameter space , namely the firing region .",
    "furthermore , it is found that as the neuron coupling strength varies , the firing region is gradually modulated and , at the weak couplings , the firing region might be separated into disconnected subregions . by a simplified network model ,",
    "we have conducted a detail analysis on the network firing mechanisms , and found the different roles that the stimulus and neuron couplings played in evoking the network .",
    "the findings shed new lights on the firing activities of complex neuronal networks , and might helpful in understanding some of the experimental observations @xcite    this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china under the grant no .  11375109 , and by the fundamental research funds for the central universities under the grant nos .",

    "<S> the dynamical responses of complex neuronal networks to external stimulus injected on a _ single _ neuron are investigated . stimulating the largest - degree neuron in the network , it is found that as the intensity of the stimulus increases , the network will be transiting from the resting to firing states and then restoring to the resting state , showing a bounded firing region in the parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is found that as the coupling strength decreases , the firing region is gradually expanded and , at the weak couplings , separated into disconnected subregions . by a simplified network model </S>",
    "<S> , we conduct a detail analysis on the bifurcation diagram of the network dynamics in the two - dimensional parameter space spanned by stimulating intensity and coupling strength , and , by introducing a new coefficient named effective stimulus , explore the mechanisms of the modified firing region . </S>",
    "<S> it is revealed that the coupling strength and stimulating intensity are equally important in evoking the network , but with different mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , the effective stimuli are _ shifted up _ globally with the increase of the stimulating intensity , while are _ drawn closer _ with the increase of the coupling strength . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamical responses of small - world and random complex networks to external stimulus injected on the largest - degree neuron are also investigated , which confirm the generality of the observed phenomena . </S>"
