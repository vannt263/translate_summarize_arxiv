    "michael faraday s discovery of magnetically induced optical activity in 1846@xcite constituted the first conclusive demonstration of an intimate connection between light and magnetism .",
    "this so - called faraday effect exists in _ all _ media and has long been applied to study the magnetic and electronic properties of materials and image magnetic domain structures.@xcite by controlling the polarization of light , a key functionality in modern opto - technology , the faraday effect plays a crucial role in applications such as optical rotators , isolators , modulators , and circulators.@xcite    during the past two decades , nonlinear optical effects , such as sum and difference frequency generation , entered the realm of magneto - optics.@xcite with nonlinear optics , unique information about the crystallographic , geometric , electronic , and magnetic structure can be acquired .",
    "it often addresses states that are inaccessible by linear optics so that a search for the nonlinear analogues of the established linear magneto - optical effects commenced .",
    "thus far , the vast majority of investigations is focused on second - order magneto - optical effects like magnetically induced second - harmonic generation ( shg).@xcite since shg in the electric - dipole approximation is limited to systems without center of inversion , it is particularly valuable for investigating the inherently noncentrosymmetric surface or interface in centrosymmetric magnets.@xcite a rotation of the polarization of a reflected shg wave with respect to the polarization of the incident fundamental light wave , the so - called `` nonlinear magneto - optical kerr effect '' , was reported.@xcite the nonlinear kerr rotation can be orders of magnitude larger than the linear kerr rotation since , in contrast to the linear case , the magnetization - induced nonlinear contributions to the susceptibility tensor can be of the same order of magnitude as the magnetization - independent ones .",
    "yet , the selectivity of shg can be its major deficiency , because in the majority of magnetically ordered compounds shg is restricted or even forbidden by symmetry and hence inappropriate for probing their magneto - optical performance . instead ,",
    "a nonlinear magneto - optical effect _ unrestricted _ by symmetry is called for . here",
    "an extension of the linear faraday rotation ( lfr ) into the regime of harmonic generation is one possibility . taking third - harmonic generation ( thg ) as an example ,",
    "the principle of such a higher - order effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) in comparison to the lfr depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "both effects correspond to a rotation of the plane of polarization of the emitted light ( frequency @xmath0 with @xmath1 ) with respect to the polarization of the incident light ( frequency @xmath2 ) by an angle @xmath3 .",
    "the rotation is generated by the spontaneous or magnetic - field - induced magnetization of the sample along the direction of light propagation . because of this similarity it is intuitive to consider the process shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) as higher - order faraday rotation .",
    "however , such a denomination first needs to be justified by placing the nonlinear magneto - optical rotation and the lfr on a common basis , macroscopically as well as microscopically .",
    "for identifying a common macroscopic basis for the two processes depicted in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) , we will first review the equations leading to the lfr .",
    "then the formalism will be expanded to the regime of harmonic generation .",
    "we will see that the third - order rotation , i.e. , the rotation of polarization of the frequency - tripled light wave with respect to the polarization of the incident fundamental light wave ( see fig .  [ fig1](b ) ) , has many properties in common with the lfr and can therefore be interpreted as its nonlinear complement . for simplicity",
    "we restrict the discussion to isotropic and uniaxial media in the absence of linear gyrotropy and absorption so that the magneto - optical rotation does not interfere with other dichroic and birefringence effects .",
    "the direction of the magnetization @xmath4 is chosen along the high - symmetry @xmath5 axis .",
    "the lfr , expressed by the magneto - optical rotation of the linear polarization of light at the frequency @xmath2 propagating through a material in the direction parallel to that of @xmath4 , is derived by inserting the linear dielectric tensor @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 as purely real and imaginary components , respectively , into the wave equation @xmath9 and solving it for a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave @xmath10 . @xmath7 and @xmath11 denote the elements of the linear dielectric function describing the propagation of light polarized parallel and perpendicular , respectively , to the polarization of the incident light . in general , the off - diagonal component @xmath8 is much smaller than the diagonal component @xmath7 .",
    "we obtain two eigenmodes , for the electromagnetic wave transmitting through the material , represented by @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 as refractive index of light with right- and left - handed circular polarization , respectively .",
    "for the geometry in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) the plane of polarization of the incident linearly polarized light is rotated by the angle @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the length of the light path in the material along the direction of @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the lfr arises due to the magnetization - induced circular birefringence and @xmath18 is proportional to the thickness of the material .      in analogy to the definition of the nonlinear magneto - optical kerr effect we can now introduce the @xmath19-th - order magneto - optical rotation as rotation of the harmonic wave at @xmath0 with respect to the polarization of the incident fundamental light wave at @xmath2 .",
    "in the simplest cases this is expressed by @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 as elements of the @xmath19-th order dielectric function describing the propagation of light polarized perpendicular and parallel , respectively , to the polarization of the incident light .    by inserting into eq .",
    "( [ eq : rot-1 ] ) the definitions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 as given above , equations  ( [ eq : rot-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : rot - n ] ) can be combined into the general expression @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 as a function and a proportionality factor , respectively .",
    "we have @xmath28 , @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 . only for @xmath33 the frequency of the ingoing and",
    "the outgoing light is the same which explains the difference in the expressions for @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in any case , eq .",
    "( [ eq : rot ] ) emphasizes that the magneto - optical rotation of any order is determined by the ratio between the off - diagonal and diagonal components of the dielectric tensor of that order .",
    "note that although we neglected absorption thus far , the components of the dielectric tensor can in general be complex .",
    "the rotation of the plane of polarization may be therefore accompanied by elliptical contributions.@xcite in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rot ] ) this is already taken into account by distinguishing between real and imaginary parts .",
    "we now have to identify the nonlinear complement to the lfr by investigating the different orders of @xmath19 .",
    "the case @xmath33 leads to the lfr discussed above and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) .",
    "as discussed , the case @xmath35 ( as well as @xmath36 ) is restricted or even forbidden by symmetry and therefore inappropriate for probing the magneto - optical performance in general .",
    "the case @xmath37 is the leading - order nonlinear magneto - optical rotation process that is , like the lfr , allowed in materials of _ any _ symmetry .",
    "the `` nonlinear magneto - optical kerr effect '' designates the magnetization - induced rotation of polarization of a reflected nonlinear ( frequency - doubled ) light wave ; in exactly the same way we might now use the term `` nonlinear faraday effect '' for the magnetization - induced rotation of polarization of a transmitted nonlinear ( frequency - tripled ) light wave with respect to the incident light wave . however , the term `` nonlinear faraday effect '' is also used for the nonlinear dependence of the lfr on the intensity of the incident light caused by multi - photon absorption.@xcite for clarity we henceforth employ the term `` third - order faraday rotation '' ( tfr ) for the effect discussed in our work .",
    "the most obvious difference between the lfr and the tfr is that the former is proportional to the thickness of the material whereas the latter is thickness - independent .",
    "the experimental verification of this striking difference will be the topic of section  [ results ] .",
    "ccc & even in @xmath4 & odd in @xmath4 + lfr & @xmath38 & @xmath39 + tfr & @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) & @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) +    [ table1 ]    for the geometry in figs .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) , nonzero elements of the linear and third - order susceptibility tensor relevant to the lfr and the tfr are summarized in table  [ table1 ] . here",
    "the third - order susceptibility is derived from the general expression for thg , @xmath44 with @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rot - n ] ) , we obtain @xmath46 despite the potential of the tfr as universal magneto - optical probe , only a single study has been reported thus far.@xcite in that study , garnet films revealed a rotation of about @xmath47 and neither the spectral characteristics nor the microscopic origin of the effect were investigated , so that the general aspects of the nature and potential of the tfr remained unclear .    in the following we will show that thin epitaxial films of the ferromagnetic semiconductor euo display a `` giant '' tfr .",
    "the rotation varies between zero in the absence of a magnetic field and about @xmath48 in a field of 2.5  t. spectroscopy reveals its microscopic origin . based on an inherent relation between the tfr and the lfr we point out the general feasibility of the tfr for probing magnetic matter and thin films in particular .",
    "euo is attracting much attention from the point of view of basic science and application.@xcite it has a high potential for semiconductor - based spintronics applications@xcite due to its half - metallic behavior with electron doping@xcite and its structural and electronic compatibility with si , gan , and gaas.@xcite at room temperature , stoichiometric euo is a paramagnetic semiconductor with a band gap of @xmath49  ev .",
    "it orders ferromagnetically at @xmath50  k. the eu@xmath51 ions have localized @xmath52 electrons with @xmath53 as the ground state , yielding a saturation magnetic moment as large as 7  @xmath54 .",
    "a multitude of remarkable magneto - optical properties have been revealed in euo , such as a strong linear and circular birefringence and dichroism,@xcite as well as a large well - investigated red - shift of the absorption edge associated to the magnetic ordering.@xcite with a rotation of @xmath55  deg / cm , euo shows one of the largest lfr.@xcite pronounced magnetization - induced shg and thg contributions have been observed on the binary eu compounds and the electronic origin of the shg and thg spectra has been discussed.@xcite hence , because of outstanding magnetic and optical properties and their strong connection , euo is an ideal compound for exploring the tfr . yet , as we will see , the results gained on euo are instructive for understanding tfr in general .",
    "epitaxial euo(001 ) films protected by an amorphous silicon ( a - si ) cap layer of 10 - 20  nm were grown by molecular - beam epitaxy on two - side polished yalo@xmath56(110 ) substrates.@xcite for most of the measurements , film with a thickness of 100  nm was used . bulk - like crystallographic , transport , and linear optical properties@xcite confirm the excellent quality of the epitaxial films .",
    "samples were mounted in an optical helium - operated split - coil cryostat in which magnetic fields of up to @xmath57  t applied along the @xmath5 axis induced the tfr .",
    "the tfr was measured with light incident perpendicular to the euo surface .",
    "the setup for nonlinear transmission spectroscopy is described in detail in ref .  .",
    "light pulses were generated in an optical parametric amplifier pumped by a regenerative ti : sapphire amplifier system providing a central wavelength of 800  nm ( 1.55  ev ) , a pulse width of 120  fs , and a repetition rate of 1  khz .",
    "the tfr was investigated at temperatures of @xmath58  k in the spectral range @xmath59 of @xmath60  ev .",
    "the nonlinear spectra of the euo films were normalized to the reference signal obtained on a wedged @xmath61-sio@xmath62 plate .",
    "they were also normalized to the spectral response of the detection system .",
    "figure  [ fig1](c ) shows the intensity of the frequency - tripled light as a function of the angular position @xmath63 of a polarization filter .",
    "maximum intensity directly reveals the direction of polarization at @xmath64 .",
    "data were taken at 10  k and @xmath65  ev for magnetic fields @xmath66 of 0  t and @xmath67  t. at @xmath68  t the sample possesses an in - plane magnetization , so that @xmath69 and @xmath70 . at @xmath71  t",
    "the situation changes entirely .",
    "the intensity of the frequency - tripled light is greatly enhanced and its maximum shows a large shift with respect to @xmath63 . here",
    "the field induces an out - of - plane magnetization @xmath72 and with it a large rotation of about @xmath73 .    in order to explore the relation of this rotation to the tfr",
    "a variety of tests was performed .",
    "first , the observed rotation agrees well with the symmetry analysis . in- and out - of - plane magnetized euo possesses the point symmetry @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , and only the latter allows the magnetically induced frequency tripling that can lead to a tfr.@xcite second , we note the reversal of the rotation occurring with the reversal of @xmath76 in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "this is a property required for faraday rotation of any order .",
    "third , fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) shows the angular dependence of the frequency - tripled signal as in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) for a variety of temperatures in the ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic state .",
    "the extracted temperature variation of the rotation is indicated by triangles and entered in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) as open squares .",
    "we see that in the vicinity of @xmath77 the rotation decreases drastically and reflects the decrease of @xmath76 .",
    "note that the onset temperature of the magnetization in euo is strongly influenced by external magnetic fields,@xcite which explains the small signal remaining just above @xmath77 .",
    "contributions by the lfr that may interfere with the third - order rotation are small . at 10  k",
    "we find that @xmath78 and @xmath79 are @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , in agreement with earlier data.@xcite      with reference to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tfr ] ) , fig .  [ fig2](b ) shows the temperature dependence of the frequency - tripled signal for @xmath42 and @xmath40 .",
    "we find that both susceptibilities change with temperature , in particular around @xmath77 , albeit in a different way .",
    "however , their magnetic - field dependence at a fixed temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) reveals that only @xmath42 responds to the applied field while @xmath40 does not . with the application of the magnetic field @xmath42 increases from zero for @xmath69 to its saturation value at @xmath82  t. in contrast , @xmath40 is independent of the applied field and the associated reorientation of the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "we therefore see that the variation of @xmath40 with temperature in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) is caused by the large temperature - dependent spectral shift occurring around @xmath77.@xcite the coupling to the magnetization is therefore an indirect band - structural effect .",
    "because of the independence of the direction of the magnetization , the band - structural shift may be parametrized by an even - power expansion , yielding in total terms @xmath83 @xmath84 , @xmath85 , etc . in @xmath40 and terms",
    "@xmath83 @xmath86 , @xmath87 , etc . in @xmath42 )",
    "( with @xmath88 as saturation magnetization at a certain temperature ) .",
    "the rotation angles are not directly affected by this band - structural shift because it enters both susceptibilities , @xmath40 as well as @xmath42 , in the same way ( they are probed at the electronic transition , see section  [ micro ] ) .",
    "considering that the frequency - tripled signal @xmath89 for @xmath42 is proportional to the square of @xmath76 because of @xmath90 , the dependence of @xmath76 on the applied field @xmath91 is extracted .",
    "the magnetic - field dependence of @xmath42 in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) reproduces the results of earlier measurements of @xmath76,@xcite thus revealing that the coupling of @xmath42 to @xmath76 is indeed linear and in agreement with table  [ table1 ] . at saturation",
    ", @xmath42 substantially exceeds @xmath40 .",
    "this notably contrasts the linear magneto - optical response , where the magnetization - induced susceptibility @xmath92 is much smaller than the magnetization - insensitive susceptibility @xmath93 .    a noticeable difference distinguishing the tfr from the lfr is the proposed independence of the rotation angle of the thickness of the material .",
    "we scrutinized this claim by measuring the tfr for euo(001 ) films with a thickness of 100 , 34 , and 10  nm .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows that within the statistical error the same value @xmath94 is observed for all three samples .",
    "thus , tfr can be particularly useful for probing the magnetic properties of very thin films where @xmath95 of the lfr would approach zero .",
    "another distinct difference between the lfr and the tfr is the dependence of the rotation angle on the magnetization .",
    "figure  [ fig3](a ) shows the angular dependence of the frequency - tripled signal for magnetic fields between 0  t and @xmath96  t. the extracted magnetic - field variation of @xmath97 entered in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) differs from that of @xmath76 . unlike the lfr , which follows the relation @xmath98 , the tfr is expressed by the relation @xmath99 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : rot - n ] ) .    in figs .  [ fig2](c ) and [ fig3](c ) the value of @xmath100 is plotted and compared to the rotation angle @xmath97 directly measured in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig3](a ) .",
    "the agreement between the two data sets is obvious .",
    "this suggests that the approximation of @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tfr ] ) by @xmath102 , which neglects dichroic effects , is applicable for determining @xmath97 .",
    "because of the excellent agreement between the two data sets , we henceforth use the convenient approximation of @xmath97 via the third - order susceptibilities , instead of measuring it by an involved polarization analysis as in figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) and [ fig3](a ) .",
    "finally , in order to disclose the microscopic mechanism of the giant tfr , its spectral origin has to be clarified .",
    "therefore , fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) shows the spectral dependence of the frequency - tripled signal for the magnetization - induced ( @xmath42 ) and the magnetization - insensitive ( @xmath40 ) susceptibilities and the estimated rotation @xmath97 at 10  k in a magnetic field @xmath103  t. while the slope of a resonance centered at @xmath104  ev is present in @xmath42 but not in @xmath40 , a pronounced peak around 3.1  ev is observed in both components .",
    "this corresponds to a specific resonance of @xmath97 at @xmath104  ev , just like in the case of the lfr , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "the lfr is attributed to the transitions from the @xmath52 ground state to the @xmath105 state of the eu@xmath51 ion.@xcite it is caused by the spin polarization and the spin - orbit splitting of the @xmath106 and @xmath107 states involved in the optical transition .",
    "we associate the tfr to the same transition , yet as a _ three - photon - resonant _ excitation .",
    "this is reasonable because the selection rules for a one - photon transition are included in that of a three - photon transition .",
    "in contrast , the peak near 3.1  ev seems to involve a _ two - photon - resonant _ transition to the @xmath105 state followed by the transition via the third photon to the higher lying @xmath108 mixing state,@xcite as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",
    "this excitation does not contribute notably to the tfr .",
    "it reflects that the selection rules for the two - photon transition to the @xmath105 state are fundamentally different from the selection rules of the lfr and also that the @xmath109 state with less magneto - optical activity is involved in the excitation process .",
    "in summary , a giant third - order magneto - optical rotation termed tfr was observed in epitaxial ferromagnetic euo films with a magnetic - field - induced out - of - plane magnetization .",
    "it results from the large spin polarization and the spin - orbit splitting of the states involved in the optical transition and reveals an inherent similarity to the lfr .",
    "however , the tfr is boosted by the ratio of the magnetic to the nonmagnetic tensor elements in the dielectric tensor @xmath110 .",
    "this ratio is much larger for the nonlinear than for the linear contributions .",
    "the giant tfr is particularly suitable for probing the magnetization of ultra - thin films and multilayers , because in contrast to the lfr , it is not affected by the reduction of the thickness of a material .",
    "in addition , the third - order faraday rotation and the second - order kerr rotation ( commonly referred to as `` nonlinear magneto - optical kerr rotation '' ) complement each other as probes for magnetism because of their different sensitivity to the symmetry .",
