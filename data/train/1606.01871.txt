    "over a decade ago , the observation of solutions characterized by localized synchrony and incoherence  @xcite , which subsequently became known as chimera states  @xcite , sparked an enormous amount of interest in coupled oscillatory systems . for identical oscillators , such dynamics exhibit symmetry breaking : the solution has less symmetry than the system itself  @xcite . at the same time , chimera states are robust against heterogeneities , including additive noise , non - identical oscillator frequencies  @xcite , various coupling topologies  @xcite , and non - complete network topologies  @xcite .",
    "they have since been observed in real - world systems such as experimental systems ranging from metronomes  @xcite to ( electro-)chemical oscillators and lasing systems@xcite .",

    "can lead to chimeras in more general oscillator models  @xcite , fully symmetric coupling ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) of kuramoto - sakaguchi phase oscillators prevents oscillators from drifting relative to each other , a feature inherent to chimera states  @xcite .",

    "asymmetry of the phase - lag parameters @xmath10 is highly relevant for real - world applications  @xcite : they correspond to energy loss along transmission lines in power grids  @xcite and yield an approximation for periodic solutions in systems with distributed delays such as neuronal networks  @xcite and mobile phone networks  @xcite . for coupled populations of coupled phase oscillators   both the _ coupling strengths _ and _ phase - lags _ affect the interaction between oscillators .",

    "this yields a natural generalization of coupled populations of coupled phase oscillators   considered previously  @xcite . in the physical context of linear coupling , as is typical of networks with mechanical or electronic coupling  @xcite , one may regard this complex constant as a response function , i.e. , @xmath9 and @xmath10 correspond to the amplitude- and phase - response of oscillators being forced by oscillators in its own or its neighboring population .",
