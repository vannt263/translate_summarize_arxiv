    "in @xcite we introduced an iterative method for computing the first eigenpair of the @xmath2-laplacian operator @xmath3 , @xmath4 , with homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition in a bounded domain @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the technique was inspired by the inverse power method or inverse iteration of finite linear algebra .    in the present paper we concentrate in the special case @xmath7 , the laplace operator @xmath8 , which was superficially dealt with in @xcite .",
    "besides clarifying some of the arguments sketched in that paper for this case and providing some error estimates , our main purpose in this work is to show how inverse iteration with shift in the presence of uniform convergence can be used in order to obtain a fast and efficient method for computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the laplacian operator with homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition for any bounded domain @xmath9 .",
    "if the eigenvalues or at least good estimates for them are _ a priori _ known , the method can produce the corresponding eigenfunctions with great speed and accuracy .",
    "the technique can alternatively also be used as a fast process to obtain the spectral decomposition of any function @xmath10 ( in other words , the fourier series of @xmath11 ) .",
    "we remark that the application of the method to the special case of the laplacian operator is more natural since the laplacian is a linear operator , @xmath12 is a hilbert space and the inverse operator @xmath13 is a self - adjoint and compact operator , therefore allowing the complete characterization of its spectral structure , as well as having the property that its eigenfunctions constitute a basis for @xmath14 ( except for compactness , these properties are absent in the @xmath2-laplacian when @xmath15 ) .",
    "our approach of the inverse iteration with shift is based on the following iterative process started by a given function @xmath16@xmath17{cccc}-\\delta_{\\sigma}\\phi_{n+1 } & = & \\phi_{n } & \\text{in } \\omega,\\\\ \\phi_{n+1 } & = & 0 & \\text{on\\ } \\partial\\omega \\end{array } \\right .",

    "_ shifted operator_.    the sequence @xmath20 is then handled in order to produce approximations for the pair @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the eigenvalue of the laplacian appearing in the spectral expansion of @xmath11 which is closest to @xmath23 and @xmath24 denotes the eigenfunction obtained as the projection of @xmath11 on the @xmath22-eingenspace .",
    "inverse iteration with shift is used in finite linear algebra in order to find the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a finite - dimensional linear operator . as an eigenvalue - finding procedure",
    "it is not as efficient as other methods , such as the @xmath25 algorithm .",
    "however , if very good estimates of the eigenvalues are known in advance , its rate of convergence to both eigenvalues and eigenfunctions can be very fast ( see @xcite , for instance ) .",
    "this approach can be naturally extended to self - adjoint compact linear operators in infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces such as the laplacian and those arising in sturm - liouville problems . in spite of this",
    ", we have not been able to find any reference in the literature to this approach being used in the laplacian context .",
    "since there is now a vast literature concerning the search for estimates for the eigenvalues of the laplacian , as well as the gaps between eigenvalues ( see , for instance , @xcite ; although particularly useful in our context would be lower bounds for the difference between consecutive eigenvalues ) , these results can be used in connection with the inverse iteration with shift algorithm to find eigenfunctions of the laplacian in arbitrary domains , as well as better approximations for its eigenvalues .",
    "it must be emphasized , however , that as with the finite linear method , the inverse iteration with shift method is not capable to find all the eigenfunctions associated to a non - simple eigenvalue .",
    "it can only find an eigenfunction of the associated eigenspace . in the generic sense most domains have laplacian spectra consisting only of simple eigenvalues ( see @xcite ) , although many domains of practical interest have eigenvalues with multiplicity greater than one ( usually , domains which exhibit some type of symmetry , although not all of them ) .",
    "algorithm 1 below is the simplest version of the inverse iteration with shift algorithm for computing one specific eigenvalue and corresponding eigenfunction of the laplacian .",
    "[ inverse iteration with shift ]    in principle , the function @xmath11 at the start of algorithm 1 should be chosen so that it will have components in all eigenspaces of the laplacian and a random choice would suffice . however , in practice , due to rounding errors any simple function can be used . in our numerical tests",
    "( see section [ tests ] ) , we observed that even the unit constant function could be used in order to obtain all the eigenvalues , even in a domain where it does not have an infinite number of them in its spectral decomposition .    in line 6 of algorithm 1 any pde solver can be used .",
    "this allows one to choose the fastest solver available for a particular domain . in line 9",
    "the eigenvalue is computed according to the uniform convergence theory developed in section [ unif ] . since uniform convergence occurs away from nodal surfaces , a point @xmath26 not in a nodal surface",
    "must be chosen ; because nodal surfaces have zero @xmath27-dimensional measures , a random choice will suffice in the vast majority of cases , even taking into account that nodal surfaces change as the computed eigenfunction changes .    in finite linear algebra , the approximation to the eigenvalue",
    "is usually computed using the rayleigh quotient . in our context , the eigenvalue can also be computed via the rayleigh quotient of the approximated eigenfunction : @xmath28 however , due to the high oscillatory nature of high frequency eigenfunctions , in order to accurately compute the integral of the ( squared ) gradient of eigenfunctions associated with these eigenvalues , a much finer grid needs to be used , which affects the efficiency of the method .",
    "therefore , the rayleigh quotient in its original form ( [ rayleigh ] ) is not recommended for the computation of the eigenvalues of the laplacian , unless one is prepared to incur the higher computational costs ( see also further comments in section [ final ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , an integration by parts argument produces the following alternative expression for the rayleigh quotient that avoids computations involving gradients : @xmath29 we obtain very satisfactory results by using this sequence in line 9 of algorithm 1 to compute eingenvalues in our numerical tests ( see section [ tests ] ) .    another alternative way to compute the eigenvalues",
    "is given by the quotient @xmath30 when the shift @xmath31 is chosen below the eigenvalue .",
    "this quotient also gives accurate approximations for the eigenvalues even using relatively coarse meshes ; the computation of the integrals of the approximated eigenfunctions , instead of their gradients , does not appear to be significantly affected by the use of coarse grids ( see section [ tests ] ) .",
    "we believe that , differently from what happens in finite dimensions , where much better and faster algorithms for finding the eigenvalues of linear operators ( matrices ) , specially self - adjoint operators , are available , the inverse iteration with shift algorithm can be a very competitive method for finding the eigenvalues of the laplacian .",
    "typical algorithms for computing laplacian eigenvalues involve the discretization of the laplacian operator and the computation of the eigenvalues of the resulting discretization matrix .",
    "however , since only a small number of the eigenvalues of the discretization matrix are good approximations to the laplacian eigenvalues ( the smaller ones ) , huge matrices are necessary in order to obtain a sufficiently good number of eigenvalues . and some problems , particularly those arising in the study of quantum billiards , demand the computation of a very large number of eigenvalues . needless to say ,",
    "besides the requirements of memory , the size of the matrix makes it computationally costly to find its eigenvalues ( see the classical @xcite book , the review @xcite and the more recent work @xcite for details ) .",
    "the inverse iteration with shift method , that requires only typical relatively modest sizes for meshes in order to solve the poisson equation with homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition , can be very competitive in terms of memory allocation and processing time .",
    "this is true even when one considers that in order to find accurate approximations for the highest order eigenvalues and eigenfunctions sometimes one needs to refine the mesh , due to the increase of oscillations .",
    "even if good estimates for the eigenvalues of a particular domain are not known in advance , a few iterations of inverse iteration with shift should be able to find good approximations to them , which can work as first estimates for the shift on a second run of the algorithm .",
    "the first choices for the shift might be concentrated around the numbers given by weiyl s law ( see @xcite or @xcite ) .    the inverse iteration with shift method",
    "can also be used in order to find the spectral decomposition of any function @xmath32 , that is , in order to find its projections on the laplacian eigenspaces .",
    "one has only to be careful to eliminate spurious projections , that is , projections which arise from rounding errors .",
    "this can be done through computing the fourier coefficient associated to each eigenspace .",
    "if this coefficient becomes less than a specified very small tolerance , this projection can be safely discarded as arising from rounding errors .",
    "the two algorithms can be combined together in order to simultaneously find both the desired spectral decomposition of a given function defined on a domain and the spectrum of the laplacian on it .",
    "the spectral decomposition algorithm is given below ( algorithm 2 ) .",
    "once again , line 11 can be replaced by ( [ weakrq1 ] ) or ( [ l2quotient ] ) .",
    "[ spectral decomposition ]    although for the sake of simplicity all computations here are done for the laplacian , the same algorithm can be used for similar elliptic operators .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the inverse iteration with shift sequence is defined in section [ sec2 ] , where most of the notation used in this paper is also established . in section 3",
    "some well - known results concerning the rayleigh quotient are recalled and proven for completeness . in sections [ l2 ] and [ unif ] we discuss @xmath33 and uniform convergence of the inverse iterated sequence , respectively . in the short section [ normaliz ]",
    "we make some considerations about the normalization process on each step of ( [ poisson ] ) which is useful for computational purposes , and in section [ tests ] we present the results of some numerical experiments made in simple domains .",
    "finally , in section [ final ] we discuss if the rate of convergence of the method could theoretically be improved through the use of the inverse iteration with shift given by the rayleigh quotient , as it is standard practice in finite linear algebra .",
    "let @xmath9 be a bounded domain in @xmath34 and @xmath35 be an orthogonal ( not necessarily normalized ) basis for @xmath36 consisting of eigenfunctions of the laplacian operator with homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition , that is , @xmath37{ll}-\\delta e_{k}=\\lambda_{k}e_{k } & \\text { \\ \\ in } \\omega,\\\\ e_{k}=0 & \\text { \\ \\ on\\ } \\partial\\omega , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the non - decreasing sequence of eigenvalues of the laplacian , counting multiplicities : @xmath39    let @xmath18 and define the _ shifted operator _",

    "thus , the spectrum of the shifted operator equals the spectrum of the laplacian operator shifted to the left by @xmath31 , while the corresponding eigenspaces are the same .",
