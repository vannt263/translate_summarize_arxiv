    "the problem considered in this paper has a long and illustrious history , which begins with the classic works of sir horace lamb in 1904 @xcite . in @xcite , lamb treated four basic problems , the so called lamb s problems , including both the two and the three dimensional cases .",
    "these problems have been studied by several authors , see for example @xcite . for the axisymmetric point - load problem ,",
    "pekeris @xcite obtained an exact expression for the surface motion in the case that the point load is given by a heaviside function .",
    "this result was further extended by schiel and protzio @xcite .",
    "for the three dimensional cases , payton , using the betti - rayleigh reciprocal theorem @xcite , obtained the displacement and the surface motion .",
    "gakenheimer , in his phd thesis @xcite , made a systematic investigation of the travelling normal point load , by using the cagniard - dehoop method .",
    "bakkeraq et al . in @xcite revisited this problem and presented a straightforward implementation of the cagniard - dehoop method .",
    "several related problems of contact mechanics and wave propagation can be found in the books of miklowitz @xcite , of johnson @xcite , and of payton @xcite .",
    "the extensive study of lamb s problems is perhaps due to the fact that they arise in a variety of physical situations , as well as to their interesting mathematical structure .    in this paper , we study two - dimensional problems under the usual assumption of plane strain . we consider arbitrary initial conditions and general stress boundary conditions , including normal line load , tangential line load , and mixed line load .",
    "we refer to the latter three stress conditions as lamb s boundary conditions .",
    "most studies of lamb s problems are based on the helmholtz decomposition and on the use of the laplace transform in time . in particular , lamb was the first to use the above approach , as well as a certain superposition which is in fact equivalent to the use of the fourier transform .",
    "miklowitz made use of the cagniard - dehoop method @xcite , which itself is based on the laplace transform .",
    "payton made use of green s functions and of the laplace transform .",
    "helmholtz decomposition has the advantage of decomposing the p - waves and s - waves .",
    "however , it has the disadvantage of introducing higher order derivatives to the boundary conditions .",
    "the use of laplace transform in time , essentially restricts the problem to the case of homogeneous initial conditions .    our new approach is based on the unified approach for solving linear and integrable nonlinear pdes introduced by one of the authors in @xcite . a crucial role in this method is played by the so - called _ global relations _ , which are algebraic relations coupling appropriate transforms of the unknown boundary values with transforms of the given data . for linear pdes this method uses three novel steps @xcite-@xcite : 1 . derive a representation for the solution in terms of an integral involving a contour in the complex fourier plane .",
    "this representation is not yet effective , because in addition to transforms of the given initial and boundary conditions , it also contains transforms of unknown boundary values .",
    "2 . analyse certain transformations in the complex fourier plane which leave invariant the transforms of the unknown boundary values .",
    "3 . eliminate the transforms of the unknown boundary values , by combining the results of the first two steps and by employing cauchy s theorem ( or more precisely jordan s lemma ) .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we recall the governing equations of elastodynamics and derive the global relations . in section 3",
    "we implement step 1 and in section 4 we implement steps 2 and 3 . in section 5",
    "we use the general representations derived in section 4 in order to analyse lamb s problems .",
    "these results are further discussed in section 6 .",
    "for certain complicated boundary value problems it seems that it is not possible to eliminate from the integral representation of the solution the transforms of the unknown boundary values .",
    "however , for some of these problems , by using the global relations , one can derive expressions for the laplace transforms of the boundary values in terms of the given data @xcite .",
    "a summary of this _ less _ effective approach is presented in the appendix .",
    "it is interesting that for the _ particular case of zero initial conditions _ , the formulae presented in the appendix reduce to the formulae first derived in the classical works of lamb .",
    "the transient problem for two dimensional elastodynamics in the half plane with lamb s boundary conditions is defined as follows : let @xmath0 @xmath1 denote the displacements of a homogeneous isotropic half space body .",
