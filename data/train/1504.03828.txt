    "in the last few decades there has been an increasing interest by the scientific community in random graphs , mostly due to their wide range of application in several branches of science .    in theoretical physics ,",
    "random graphs have been used as a tool to set up discrete models of quantum gravity .",
    "the basic idea underlying such models is the discretization of spacetime _ via _ triangulations ( in the spirit of regge calculus ) and the representation of fluctuating geometries , naturally arising in the path - integral approach to the quantization of gravity , in terms of random triangulations .",
    "more precisely , according to the path - integral formalism , the partition function in ( euclidean ) quantum gravity is formally given by the expression @xmath0 \\ ; e^{- \\mathcal{s}_{\\mu}[g]}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 $ ] is the einstein - hilbert action , @xmath2 is the cosmological constant and the integral is intended over the space of metrics ( modulo diffeomorphisms ) of a manifold @xmath3 .",
    "a discretization scheme is often used to make sense of such expression .",
    "this can be implemented , for example , by triangulating the manifold @xmath3 by finite triangulations built up of equilateral triangles of side @xmath4 , so that each metric ( the dynamical variables of the continuum theory ) corresponds to a different triangulation . in such framework , the discrete counterpart of the partition function ( [ eq : qg_partfun ] ) can be defined as @xmath5},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the set of all inequivalent triangulations of @xmath3 and @xmath7 $ ] is the discrete analog of the einstein - hilbert action . in two dimensions",
    "@xmath7 $ ] consists of the volume term alone , thus the discrete partition function reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the number of triangles in @xmath10 and a factor proportional to @xmath11 has been absorbed in @xmath2 .",
    "note , however , that the above discussion is purely heuristic , as a rigorous mathematical treatment of the gravitational path - integral and its discretization is still missing .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a comprehensive treatment of this subject .    in @xcite , the so - called _ dynamical triangulation _ model is introduced as a triangulation technique of euclidean surfaces .",
    "it was later discovered that such model produces some non - physical solutions , namely the presence of causality violating geometries .",
    "the _ causal dynamical triangulation _ ( cdt ) model was first proposed in @xcite as a possible cure for such anomalies . in this model",
    "a causal structure ( mimicking that of minkowski spacetime ) is introduced in the theory from the start , by restricting the class of allowed triangulations to those that can be sliced perpendicularly to the time direction and with fixed topology on the spatial slices .",
    "malyshev @xcite gave a solid mathematical ground for such models , developing a general theory of gibbs fields on random spaces where matter ( represented by the configurations of spins ) is naturally coupled with the gravity ( represented by the graph ) .",
    "observe that even without spins the cdt model for two - dimensional surfaces exhibits a non - trivial phase transition .",
    "this model is solved analytically : the partition function is explicitly derived along with the scaling limits for the correlation functions in @xcite .",
    "nowadays most of its geometrical properties , such as its hausdorff and spectral dimension @xcite , are very well understood .",
    "in particular , it has been shown @xcite that the model exhibits a non - trivial behaviour : depending on the parameters the limiting average surface can behave as one - dimensional ( subcritical regime ) , whereas at a certain value ( criticality ) it has properties of two - dimensional space .",
    "in such a framework , it is certainly interesting to consider statistical mechanical models on random planar graphs , as they can be seen as the discrete realization of the coupling between matter fields and gravity .",
    "probably , one of the most well - known of these systems is the ising model on planar random lattice .",
    "this was studied and exactly solved by kazakov et al . in @xcite , using matrix model techniques .",
    "however , the ising model on causal triangulation seems to be a much more difficult problem to address .",
    "the ising model on the critical random causal triangulation fixed _ a priori _ ( the so - called _ quenched _ version ) has been proved to exhibit a phase transition @xcite .",
    "also , for the _ annealed _ coupling ( ising - spin configuration and triangulation sampled together at random ) some numerical @xcite and even analytic results @xcite are obtained .",
    "still the exact solution to the ising model on cdt remains to be an open question .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in recent years statistical models have been studied on different random geometries , other than random causal triangulations , such as random trees @xcite and higher dimensional random graphs @xcite . in particular , in @xcite the authors study the annealed coupling of an ising model ( with external magnetic field ) with a certain class of random trees ( called _ generic _ trees ) .",
    "it has been proved that the set of infinite trees decorated with ising spins consists of trees made of a single infinite path stemming from the tree s root , and on whose vertices finite trees are attached .",
    "this shows , by comparison with the case without spins @xcite , that the spin system does not affect the geometry of the underlying graph .",
    "furthermore , it is proved that , as a consequence of this 1-dimensional feature , the infinite spin system does not experience any phase transition",
    ".    quenched models of ising spins on random graphs have also been studied in the recent literature , for example in @xcite , where ising models on certain types of random graphs ( locally tree - like graphs ) are considered and an explicit expression of the free energy is provided .",
    "here we study the annealed coupling of an ising model , at inverse temperature @xmath12 , on a random planar causal triangulation .",
    "we provide bounds on the region of the @xmath13-plane where the partition function exists , improving the bounds known so far @xcite , at least in the low- and high - temperature regions .",
    "furthermore , we discuss some magnetization properties of the spin system , proving that at sufficiently high - temperature , the mean magnetization of the central spin goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : defs ] , we define the model and , following @xcite , introduce the concept of _ spin - graph_. in sec . [ sec : results ] we collect the main results and we discuss them . all the proofs are given in the remaining sections .",

    "2 .   all faces of the graph are triangles , with the only exception of the external face .",

    "hence , the following relations hold @xmath247 and the degree of every vertex in @xmath245 , except @xmath246 , is 3 .",
    "consider now the partition function @xmath248 the notion of dual graph allows us to express eq .",
    "( [ eq : z_fixb ] ) as @xmath249 where @xmath250 is a subset of edges ( including the empty one ) consisting of edge - disjoint connected components of @xmath245 each of which is a cycle . in other words ,",
    "every vertex in @xmath250 has an even degree in @xmath245 .",
    "such subgraphs are called even subgraphs .",
    "the above expression of the partition function is known as low - temperature expansion .",
    "observe that the interactions in ( [ htri ] ) through the adjacent triangles can be rewritten as interaction through the edges of the dual graph .",
    "therefore , the partition function for causal triangulations with spins on the faces is given by @xmath251 which still slightly differs from the one studied in @xcite and @xcite ( because , as said above , we consider triangulations of a plane , not of a torus ) .",
    "let us rewrite @xmath252 using the high - temperature expansions ( [ ht ] ) : @xmath253 where the sum runs over even subgraphs @xmath250 as in ( [ zn ] ) .",
    "for each @xmath103 let us now define the transformations @xmath254 and @xmath255 , so that @xmath256 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tempdual ] ) and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : edgedual])-([eq : vxdual ] ) , the partition function ( [ eq : zhte ] ) reads @xmath257 then , taking into account that @xmath258 and noting that eq .",
    "( [ eq : tempdual ] ) is equivalent to @xmath259 , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : cosmdual ] ) a straightforward calculation leads to @xmath260",
    "first , observe that @xmath261 hence , the partition function @xmath262 exists for all @xmath34 when @xmath263 defined in ( [ eq : sub_reg ] ) , i.e. , @xmath264    for @xmath112-boundary conditions , the high - temperature expansion ( [ ht ] ) of the partition function reads as @xmath265 @xmath266 where @xmath267 similarly , the expected value of the magnetization of the central spin ( [ eq : s0p_expect ] ) can be written as @xmath268 where now @xmath269      since for any @xmath69 there exists a path @xmath270 , with @xmath271 , connecting the root @xmath19 to @xmath68 , such that @xmath272 , we have by ( [ j31 ] ) @xmath273 for any @xmath274 which satisfy ( [ j30 ] ) .",
    "this ( together with the symmetry in the model ) proves theorem [ tc ] .",
    "note that under assumption that @xmath275 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : zpl_hte ] ) it follows that @xmath276    consider now formula ( [ j31 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath277 be a subset of edges .",
    "since by the definition the degree of @xmath19 in @xmath25 is odd , it has to be positive .",
    "hence , the set @xmath25 is not empty : it contains at least one edge incident to @xmath19 .",
    "consider now the connected component of @xmath25 which contains @xmath19 , denote it @xmath278 .",
    "notice , that @xmath279 .",
    "let also @xmath280 and @xmath281 denote the set of vertices spanned by the graphs @xmath25 and @xmath278 , correspondingly .",
    "for any @xmath282 let @xmath283 be the degree of the vertex @xmath284 in the component @xmath278 . observe that @xmath285 , as we introduced above the incidence number .",
    "notice that by the property of a graph the sum of all degrees is twice the number of the edges , i.e. , @xmath286 since @xmath287 is an odd number , we must have at least one odd number in the remaining sum .",
    "but the only vertices in @xmath53 which might have an odd degree are on the slice @xmath288 .",
    "hence , the connected component @xmath278 has at least one vertex on the slice @xmath68 , which implies that @xmath278 must contain a path between @xmath289 and @xmath68 .",
    "this gives us a bound @xmath290 .",
    "now taking into account that @xmath291 , we derive from ( [ j31 ] ) the inequality @xmath292    using a rough bound @xmath293 and ( [ eq : zpl_lobound_ht ] ) , we get from ( [ eq : mag_bound1 ] ) @xmath294 which holds at least for all @xmath295 .",
    "therefore , using ( [ eq : w_asym ] ) , we have that for @xmath12 small enough , @xmath296 this proves the statement of theorem [ thm : mag ] .",
    "by the definitions ( [ j7 ] ) and ( [ gf ] ) we have @xmath297    consider the numerator of the last fraction . for",
    "any @xmath298 let us denote @xmath299 the set of edges between these two graphs @xmath166 and @xmath165 ; call it an _ interaction _ set .",
    "then by the definition ( [ h ] ) we have for all @xmath298 @xmath300 also , counting the number of triangles we get for all @xmath298 @xmath301 similar relations to ( [ j2 ] ) and ( [ j3 ] ) hold as well for any @xmath302 . making use of ( [ j2 ] ) and ( [ j3 ] ) we derive from ( [ j1 ] )",
    "@xmath303 it remains to notice that the denumerator in ( [ j9 ] ) equals @xmath304    combining ( [ j9 ] ) with ( [ j8 ] ) we get the first equality in ( [ p1 ] ) ; the second equality follows by definition [ dbc ] .",
    "consider the multiple series @xmath305 with @xmath189 .",
    "summing over @xmath306 we obtain @xmath307 where we denoted @xmath308 . inserting it in the equation and summing over @xmath309",
    "we obtain @xmath310 where @xmath311 . summing over the remaining @xmath182 s",
    ", we obtain @xmath312 where @xmath313 is the solution to the recursion relation @xmath314 this reads @xmath315 with @xmath316    for @xmath317 , substituting ( [ eq : rec_sol ] ) into ( [ eq : w_sol ] ) we get @xmath318 which gives @xmath319 in particular we have @xmath320 where @xmath321 this yields the first statement of lemma [ la ] .",
    "the rest follows directly by the results of @xcite .",
    "we have that , for any @xmath322 , @xmath313 is monotonically increasing @xmath323 therefore , using that @xmath324 we obtain that , for any @xmath325 and @xmath322 , @xmath326    now , consider the series @xmath327 by eq .",
