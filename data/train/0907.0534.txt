    "some interpretational difficulties  @xcite with the standard version  @xcite led david bohm to develop in the 1950 s @xcite an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics . despite initial criticisms ,",
    "this theory has recently received much attention @xcite , having experimented in the past few years an important revitalization , supported by a new computationally oriented point of view . in this way , many interesting practical applications , including the analysis of the tunnelling mechanism @xcite , scattering processes @xcite , or the classical  quantum correspondence @xcite , just to name a few , have been revisited using this novel point of view . also , the chaotic properties of these trajectories @xcite , or more fundamental issues , such as the extension to quantum field theory @xcite , or the dynamical origin of born s probability rule @xcite ( one of the most fundamental cornerstones of the quantum theory ) have been addressed within this framework .",
    "most interesting in bohmian mechanics is the fact that this theory is based on quantum trajectories , `` piloted '' by the de broglie s wave which creates a ( quantum ) potential term additional to the physical one derived from the actual forces existing in the system @xcite .",
    "this term brings into the theory interpretative capabilities in terms of intuitive concepts and ideas , which are naturally deduced due to fact that quantum trajectories provide causal connections between physical events well defined in configuration and time .",
    "once this ideas have been established as the basis of many numerical studies , it becomes , in our opinion , of great importance to provide firm dynamical grounds that can support the arguments based on quantum trajectories .",
    "for example , it has been recently discussed that the chaotic properties of quantum trajectories are critical for a deep understanding of born s probability quantum postulate , considering it as an emergent property @xcite .",
    "unfortunately very little progress , i.e. rigorous formally proved mathematical results , has taken place along this line due to the lack of a solid theory that can foster this possibility .",
    "moreover , there are cases in the literature clearly demonstrating the dangers of not proceeding in this way .",
    "one example can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a chaotic character was ascribed to quantum trajectories for the quartic potential , supporting the argument solely on the fact that numerically computed neighboring pairs separate exponentially .",
    "this analysis was clearly done in a way in which the relative importance of the quantum effects could not be gauged .",
    "something even worse happened with the results reported in @xcite , that were subsequently proved to be wrong in a careful analysis of the trajectories @xcite .",
    "recently , some of the authors have made in refs .",
    "@xcite what we consider a relevant advance along the line proposed in this paper , by considering the relationship between the eventual chaotic nature of quantum trajectories and the vortices existing in the associated velocity field which is given by the quantum potential , a possibility that had been pointed out previously by frisk @xcite .",
    "vortices has always attracted the interest of scientists from many different fields .",
    "they are associated to singularities at which certain mathematical properties become infinity or abruptly change , and play a central role to explain many interesting phenomena both in classical and quantum physics @xcite . in these papers",
    "it was shown that quantum trajectories are , in general , intrinsically chaotic , being the motion of the velocity field vortices a sufficient mechanism to induce this complexity @xcite . in this way , the presence of a single moving vortex , in an otherwise classically integrable system , is enough to make quantum trajectories chaotic .",
    "when two or few vortices exist , the interaction among them may end up in the annihilation or creation of them in pairs with opposite vorticities .",
    "these phenomenon makes that the size of the regular regions in phase space grows as vortices disappear @xcite .",
    "finally , it has been shown that when a great number of vortices are present the previous conclusions also hold , and they statistically combine in such a way that they can be related with a suitably defined lyapunov exponent , as a global numerical indicator of chaos in the quantum trajectories @xcite .",
    "summarizing , this makes of chaos the general dynamical scenario for quantum trajectories , and this is due to the existence and motion of the vortices of the associated velocity field .    in this paper",
    ", we extend and rigorously justify the numerical results in  @xcite concerning the behavior of quantum trajectories and its structure by presenting the general analysis of a particular problem of general interest , namely a two  dimensional harmonic oscillator , where chaos does not arise from classical reasons . in this way",
    ", we provide a systematic classification of all possible dynamical behaviors of the existing quantum trajectories , based on the application of dynamical systems theory @xcite .",
    "this classification provides a complete `` road  map '' which makes possible a deep understanding , put on firm grounds , of the dynamical structure for the problem being addressed .",
    "the bohmian mechanics formalism of quantum trajectories starts from the suggestion made by madelung of writing the wave function in polar form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are two real functions of position and time . for convenience",
    ", we set @xmath3 throughout the paper , and consider a particle of unit mass .",
    "substitution of this expression into the time - dependent schrdinger equation allows to recast the quantum theory into a `` hydrodynamical '' form @xcite , which is governed by , @xmath4 which are the continuity and the `` quantum '' hamilton - jacobi equations , respectively . the qualifying term in the last expression is customarily included since this equation contains an extra non - local contribution ( determined by the quantum state ) , @xmath5 , called the `` quantum '' potential .",
    "together with @xmath6 , this additional term determines the total forces acting on the system , and it is responsible for the so - called quantum effects in the dynamics of the system .",
    "similarly to what happens in the standard hamilton - jacobi theory , eqs .   and   allow to define , for spinless particles , quantum trajectories by integration of the differential equations system : @xmath7 .",
    "alternatively , one can consider the velocity vector field @xmath8 notice that , in general , this bohmian vector field is not hamiltonian , but it may nevertheless have some interesting properties .",
    "in particular , for the example considered in this paper it will be shown that it is time - reversible , this symmetry allowing the study of its dynamics in a systematic way .",
    "let us recall that a system , @xmath9 , is time - reversible if there exists an involution , @xmath10 , that is a change of variables satisfying @xmath11 and @xmath12 , such that the new system results in @xmath13 .",
    "one of the dynamical consequences of reversibility is that if @xmath14 is a solution , then so it is @xmath15 .",
    "this fact introduces symmetries in the system giving rise to relevant dynamical constraints .",
    "for example , let us assume that @xmath16 is a time - reversible symmetry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : reversible ] ) .",
    "then any solution @xmath17 defines another solution given by @xmath18 .",
    "let us remark that this fact constraints the system dynamics since if , for example , @xmath14 crosses the symmetry axis ( @xmath19 is invariant under @xmath20 ) then the two solutions must coincide .",
    "we conclude this section by stressing that time - reversible systems generated a lot of interest during the 80 s due to the fact that they exhibit most of the properties of hamiltonian systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , this type of systems can have quasi - periodic tori which are invariant under both the flow and the involution @xmath20 .",
    "that is , kam theory fully applies in this context .",
    "furthermore , some interesting results concerning the splitting of separatrices have been developed successfully for time - reversible systems  @xcite , providing powerful tools for the study of homoclinic and heteroclinic chaos .",
    "the system that we choose to study is the two dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator . without loss of generality ,",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian operator for @xmath21 can be written in the form @xmath22 in this paper , we consider the particular combination of eigenstates : @xmath23 with energy @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 with energy @xmath27 .",
    "it can be immediately checked that the time evolution of the resulting wave function is given by @xmath28 where may look arbitrary at this point , but it makes simpler the notation for the canonical form introduced in the next section . ] @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , subject to the usual normalization condition @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , we further assume the condition @xmath33 in order to ensure the existence of a unique vortex in the velocity field at any time .",
    "accordingly , the quantum trajectories associated to   are solutions of the system of differential equations : @xmath34 where @xmath35 to integrate this equation a 7/8th order runge - kutta - fehlberg method has been used . moreover , since the vector field is periodic , the dynamics can be well monitored by using stroboscopic sections .",
    "in particular , we plot the solution @xmath36 at times @xmath37 for @xmath38 and for several initial conditions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase : noca ] we show the results of two such stroboscopic sections .",
    "as can be seen the left plot corresponds to completely integrable motions , whereas in the right one sizeable chaotic zones coexisting with stability islands , this strongly suggesting the applicability of the kam scenario .",
    "however , our vector field is neither hamiltonian nor time - reversible , and then the kam theory does not directly apply to this case .",
    "however , we will show how a suitable change of variables can be performed that unveils a time - reversible symmetry existing in our vector field .",
    "for this purpose , we first recall that the structure of gradient vector fields is preserved under orthogonal transformations . in this way , if we consider the transformation @xmath39 , with @xmath40 , applied to @xmath41 , we have that @xmath42 , being @xmath43 . in other words , any orthogonal transformation can be performed on the wave function instead of on the vector field .",
    "[ lem : cano ] if eq .",
    "satisfies the non - degeneracy condition @xmath44 , then there exist an orthogonal transformation and a time shift , such that the wave function takes the form @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 satisfy @xmath49 .",
    "we will refer to the wave function   as the canonical form of  , and the rest of the paper is devoted to the study of this case . for this reason , the hat in the coefficients will be omitted , since it is understood that @xmath50 . in table  [ tab : prop ] we give the actual values the canonical coefficients after the transformation corresponding to the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase : noca ] .    for convenience , we consider the complexified phase space @xmath51 , so that the wave function   results in @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 . then , it is easy to check that the vortex , i.e. the set of points where the wave function vanishes , has the following position with respect to time @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "notice that the vortex is well defined thanks to the non - degeneracy assumption , and its trajectory follows an ellipse .",
    "this ellipse does not appear in the usual canonical form , but this can be made so by performing the rotation : @xmath60 and the time shift : @xmath61 . in this way",
    "@xmath62 where it is clear that by choosing @xmath63 and @xmath64 , the desired result is obtained .",
    "then , the corresponding wave function in these new coordinates is @xmath65 that can be further simplified since the factor @xmath66 plays no role in the bohmian equations for the quantum trajectories . finally , by recovering the coefficients in cartesian coordinates",
    ", one obtains @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which renders eq .  .",
    "throughout the rest of the paper we consider the wave function   with @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath50 .",
    "let us remark that by changing the time @xmath72 , if necessary , we can further restrict the study to the case @xmath73 .",
    "the corresponding quantum trajectories are then obtained from the vector field @xmath74 where @xmath75 . in these coordinates ,",
    "the only vortex of the system follows the trajectory given by @xmath76 which corresponds to an ellipse of semi - axes @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase1 ] we show some stroboscopic sections corresponding to this ( canonical ) velocity field for different values of the parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "as can be seen , a wide variety of dynamical behaviors , characteristics of a system with mixed dynamics , is found . in the left - top panel , which corresponds to the case in which @xmath81 ( vortex moving in a circle )",
    ", we have sections corresponding to a totally integrable case . as we move from left to right and top to bottom some of these tori",
    "are broken , and these areas of stochasticity coexist with others in which the motion is regular , this including different chains of islands",
    ". moreover , the size of the chaotic regions grows as the value of @xmath80 separates from that of @xmath79 .",
    "this variety of results can be well understood and rationalize by using some standard techniques of the field of dynamical systems , in the following way . although the vector field   is not hamiltonian , it is time - reversible with respect to the involution @xmath16 .",
    "this result is very important for the purpose of the present paper , since it implies that the kam theory applies to our system if we are able to write down our vector field in the form @xmath82 , @xmath83 , being the dynamics corresponding to @xmath84 integrable and @xmath85 time - reversible .",
    "more specifically , let us assume that @xmath84 does not depend on @xmath86 and @xmath85 be @xmath87-periodic with respect to @xmath86 .",
    "moreover , let us assume that for @xmath84 there exists a family of periodic orbits whose frequency varies along the family ( non - degeneracy condition ) .",
    "then , our result guarantees that when the effect of the perturbation @xmath88 is considered , most of the previous periodic orbits give rise to invariant tori of frequencies @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the frequency of the unperturbed periodic orbit .",
    "of course , the persistence of these objects is conditioned to the fact that the vector @xmath89 satisfies certain arithmetic conditions ( see  @xcite for details ) . since these arithmetic conditions are fulfilled for a big ( in the sense of the lebesgue measure ) set of the initial orbits , the important hypothesis that we have to check in order to ascertain",
    "the applicability of the kam theory is the non - degeneracy of the frequency map .    in our problem ,",
    "two such integrable cases exists .",
    "first , if @xmath91 the vortex is still at the origin and the time periodic part in the vector field disappears . as a consequence ,",
    "all the quantum orbits of the system appear as ellipses centered at the origin in the @xmath92-plane .",
    "it will be shown in the next section that the corresponding frequency varies monotonically along the orbits .",
    "this case has not been explicitly included in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase1 ] due to its simplicity .",
    "second , and as will be analyzed in sect .",
    "[ ssec : nonautonomous ] , if @xmath93 , or equivalently @xmath81 , that is the vortex moves in a circle , the vector field is also integrable for any value of @xmath94 .",
    "the corresponding stroboscopic sections are shown in the top - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase1 ] ) . here , the structure of the phase space changes noticeably , since two new periodic orbits , one stable and the other unstable , appear .",
    "moreover , the obtained integrable vector field depends on @xmath86 .",
    "we will show that this time dependence can be eliminated by means of a suitable change of coordinates , showing that our problem remains in the context described in the previous paragraph .",
    "the rest of the panels in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase1 ] can be understood as the evolution of this structure as the perturbation , here represented by the difference between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , as dictated by the kam theorem .    to conclude the paper ,",
    "let us now discuss in detail the two integrable cases in the next two sections .",
    "for @xmath91 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 it is easily seen that the vector field   is integrable . actually , the orbits of the quantum trajectories in the @xmath92-plane are ellipses around the origin ( position at which the vortex is fixed ) . also , the frequency of the corresponding trajectories approaches infinity as they get closer to the vortex position .",
    "let us now compute the frequency @xmath90 of these solutions .",
    "first , we introduce a new time variable @xmath99 , satisfying @xmath100 , and then solve the resulting system , thus obtaining @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the distance from the vortex .",
    "next , we recover the original time , @xmath86 , by solving the differential equation defining the previous change of variables @xmath103 whose solution is given by @xmath104 notice that this equation is invertible since @xmath105 , and then @xmath106 , @xmath107 being a @xmath87-periodic function . finally , introducing this expression into",
    ", one can conclude that the solution has a frequency given by @xmath108 that varies monotonically with respect to the distance to the vortex .",
    "then , for @xmath109 , the existence of invariant tori around the vortex is guaranteed .",
    "let us consider now the case of non - vanishing values of @xmath93 for any @xmath110 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath111 , and system   can be written as @xmath112 where @xmath113 .",
    "this vector field corresponds to the following hamiltonian @xmath114 that it is actually integrable .",
    "[ lem : integra ] let us consider @xmath115 ( energy ) , the symplectic variable conjugate to @xmath86 , and define the autonomous hamiltonian @xmath116 , then we have that @xmath117 is a first integral of @xmath118 , in involution and functionally independent . as a consequence , if @xmath111 the system is completely integrable .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the poisson bracket with respect to the canonical form @xmath119 satisfies @xmath120 .",
    "moreover , @xmath121 does not depend on @xmath115 , so that it is an independent first integral .",
    "taking these results into account , one can completely understand the picture presented in the top - left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase1 ] .",
    "since the system is integrable , it is foliated by invariant tori , despite the two periodic orbits that are created by a resonance introduced when parameter @xmath94 changes from @xmath91 to @xmath110 .",
    "next , we characterize these two periodic orbits :    [ lem : periodic ] if @xmath122 , the system has two periodic orbits given by @xmath123 where the coefficients @xmath124 and @xmath125 are given by @xmath126 . moreover , the orbit @xmath127 is hyperbolic with characteristic exponents @xmath128 , and @xmath129 is elliptic with characteristic exponents @xmath130 . if @xmath131 the same result holds just switching the roles of @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "it is known that if the sets @xmath132 are bounded differentiable submanifolds , their connected components carry quasi - periodic dynamics .",
    "moreover , the critical points of @xmath121 determine the periodic orbits of the system .",
    "therefore , these periodic orbits are given by expressions : @xmath133 , and @xmath134 , which can also be written as @xmath135 from which we obtain our two periodic orbits : @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , with @xmath138 .",
    "in addition , it is easy to check that @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively .",
    "finally , the stability of these orbits can be obtained by considering the following associated variational equations , @xmath141 solutions for this equation can be easily obtained by using the complex variable @xmath142 , and solving @xmath143 .",
    "we have the following set of fundamental solutions @xmath144 for the hyperbolic case , and @xmath145 for the elliptic one .",
    "finally , the corresponding characteristic exponents can be obtained by a straightforward computation of the monodromy matrix .",
    "notice that the chaotic sea observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase1 ] is associated to the intersection of the invariant manifolds of the hyperbolic periodic orbit that we have computed .",
    "now , and in order to apply kam theorem , we compute locally the frequency map of this unperturbed system around the vortex and the elliptic periodic orbit . to this end",
    ", we perform a symplectic change of coordinates in a neighborhood of these objects in order to obtain action - angle variables up to third order in the action .    in general ,",
    "let @xmath146 be a hamiltonian that is @xmath87-periodic with respect to @xmath86 and has a first integral , @xmath147 .",
    "let us consider the generating function , @xmath148 , determining a symplectic change of variables @xmath149 defined implicitly by @xmath150 where @xmath151 is also @xmath87-periodic .",
    "this transformation is introduced in such a way that the new hamiltonian depends only on @xmath152 @xmath153 since a first integral of the system is known , we can define the corresponding action as @xmath154 from eq .",
    ", we obtain locally the equation @xmath155 , so that we have @xmath156 . introducing this expression into",
    ", we obtain the following equation for @xmath157 : @xmath158 and can conclude that , since @xmath157 must be @xmath87-periodic with respect to @xmath86 , then @xmath159 has to satisfy @xmath160 where @xmath161 denotes average with respect to @xmath86 . finally , we notice that since @xmath162 is a first integral , we can define @xmath157 so that @xmath151 becomes @xmath87-periodic .",
    "computations are simplified observing that the left hand side in eq .",
    "does not depend on @xmath163 ( we use the fact that @xmath162 is a first integral ) , so we can set @xmath164 . according to this , we have to solve @xmath165 , where @xmath166 and then we have to compute the average @xmath167 , where @xmath168 .",
    "first , let us consider a neighborhood of the vortex for @xmath169 . to this end",

    "on the other hand , a neighborhood of the elliptic periodic orbit for @xmath169 can be studied by means of the variables @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "one thus obtains that the hamiltonian and the first integral are given by @xmath187 where @xmath188 .",

    "we introduce the notation @xmath196 in order to set the periodic orbit at @xmath197 .",

    "these averages are computed easily by using the method of residues .",
    "in this paper we present an scheme to study in a systematic way the intrinsic stochasticity and general complexity of the quantum trajectories that are the basis of quantum mechanics in the formalism developed by bohm in the 1950 s . in our opinion",
    "this approach , which based on the ideas and results of the dynamical systems theory , can seriously contribute to establish firm grounds that foster the importance of the conclusions of future studies relying on such trajectories , thus avoiding errors and ambiguities that has happened in the past .",

    "moreover , there is a chaotic sea associated to the hyperbolic periodic orbit .",
    "the kam theory has been applied to this scenario by resorting to a suitable time - reversible symmetry , that is directly observed in the canonical form for the velocity field determining the quantum trajectories of the system .",
    "it should be remarked that the results reported here concerning the hyperbolic periodic orbit constitute a generalization of those previously reported in  @xcite , in the sense that here a more concise and constructive approach to the associated dynamics , is presented .",
    "we summarize the dynamical characteristics of the different possibilities arising from the canonical velocity field in table  [ table : roadmap ] , that represents a true road  map to navigate across the dynamical system , i.e.  quantum trajectories , that are defined based on the pilot effect @xcite of the wave function .",
    "also , note that the generic model , i.e.  when @xmath207 or @xmath208 do not vanish , does not satisfy any of the properties considered in the table .",
