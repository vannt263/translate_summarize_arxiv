    "statistics of galaxy clusters , along with cosmic microwave background and large - scale distribution of galaxies , has made significant contribution to the establishment of the standard cosmological model dominated by cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "indeed the resulting cdm paradigm has passed a variety of theoretical and observational tests , except for somewhat controversial problems on small scales . while there are a number of important successes in terms of the spherically averaged properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , observed galaxy clusters are typically far from spherical .",
    "nevertheless a majority of previous studies on galaxy clusters has not properly taken into account their non - sphericity .    in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we found that the evolution of non - sphericity in n - body simulations is not in quantitative agreement with a simple model of ellipsoidal collapse .",
    "we also found that the probability density function ( pdf ) of projected axis ratios of dark matter halos is empirically well approximated by the beta function , which is fairly insensitive to the mass and redshift of those halos .",
    "while the latter result is potentially useful in confronting the result with the data of weak lensing halos , there are a couple of fundamental limitations .",
    "one is that the currently available number of good - quality weak - lensing data is quite limited .",
    "the other is that the axis ratio from the lensing shear map needs to be measured without assuming the self - similarity in the non - sphericity of halos ( see , _",
    "e.g. , _ * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore we consider , instead , the non - sphericity of the x - ray surface brightness ( xsb ) @xmath1 of galaxy clusters in the present paper . since @xmath1 is one of the primary observables for galaxy clusters , a large number of high - quality data - sets are already available , and also is expected to further increase in the near future .",
    "in fact , @xcite has measured the non - sphericity of the xsb of 61 galaxy clusters , and reported that the pdf of their axis ratio is consistent with the prediction on the basis of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will revisit the problem in the present paper because the theoretical prediction of non - sphericity of @xmath1 is more difficult than the observational measurements due to the complicated effects of baryons in galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "the distribution of gas is generally different from that of dark matter in clusters @xcite . under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse )",
    ", the gas mass density @xmath2 satisfies the following equation : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gas pressure , and @xmath5 is the gravitational potential mainly determined by the dark matter density distribution .",
    "if the gas is isothermal , equation ( [ eq : hse ] ) reduces to @xmath6 .",
    "thus the resulting gas distribution traces the _ isopotential _ surface , instead of the _ isodensity _ surface of the underlying dark matter .",
    "since the isopotential surfaces tend to be rounder than the isodensity surfaces , gas distribution becomes more spherical than that of dark matter @xcite .    in reality , the conventional assumption of hse is not so accurate @xcite due to the dynamical motion of gas . for those reasons ,",
    "the non - sphericity of gas distribution can not be related to that of dark matter distribution in a straightforward fashion .",
    "hence it is essential to use numerical simulations including gas physics in order to precisely study the non - sphericity of gas density , and therefore that of @xmath1 of galaxy clusters .",
    "this is exactly what we will address in this paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : numerical ] briefly describes the horizon simulation that we use in modeling the non - sphericity of galaxy clusters .",
    "we emphasize the important role of baryon physics , in particular , the active galactic nuclei ( agns ) feedback by considering spherically - averaged density and temperature profiles .",
    "then we measure the axis ratios of dark matter , stellar , and xsb distributions for simulated galaxy clusters in section [ sec : statistics ] .",
    "section [ sec : comparison ] compares the pdf of the axis ratios constructed from 40 simulated clusters against that computed by @xcite for observed 61 clusters .",
    "final section is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "our current study is entirely based on samples of simulated groups and clusters of galaxies extracted from three cosmological hydrodynamical runs , horizon - agn ( h@xmath7 ) , horizon - noagn ( h@xmath8 ) , and horizon - dm ( h@xmath9 ) .",
    "results of h@xmath7   are already described in detail in @xcite , so we briefly describe here the major feature of those runs that is relevant to our current discussion .",
    "the simulation adopts a set of cosmological parameters derived from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe 7 year @xcite ; @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the simulation runs employ @xmath17 dark matter particles in a periodic cube with a side length of 100 @xmath18 mpc , which results in a dark matter mass resolution of @xmath19 .",
    "the three runs adopt the identical initial conditions that are generated with the mpgrafic software @xcite , except the fact that the dark matter density parameter in h@xmath9 is set as @xmath20 , instead of @xmath21 in h@xmath7 and h@xmath8 .",
    "hydrodynamics of gas and other baryon physics is solved on grids over the simulation box .",
    "the size of gas cells is initially set to 136 kpc , and is refined subsequently when the number of dark matter particles in a cell becomes more than eight , or when the total baryonic mass in a cell becomes eight times the dark matter mass resolution ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the refinement is carried out up to 7 times , and therefore the minimum cell size is 1.06 kpc .",
    "the radiative cooling of gas due to h , he , and metals is modeled according to @xcite",
    ". heating from a uniform uv background is also implemented following @xcite .",
    "star particles are created according to the schmidt - kennicutt law using a random poisson process @xcite if the gas hydrogen number density in a cell exceeds the threshold of @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , feedback from stellar winds , supernovae ( sne ) type ia and ii are also taken into account for mas , energy , and metal release .",
    "type ii sne are taken into account assuming the salpeter initial mass function .",
    "the sn energy is released into the surrounding gas according to the sedov blast wave solution because the thermal input is radiated away due to the efficient gas cooling in high - density regions .",
    "the frequency of type ia sn explosions follows @xcite , and the mechanical energy from type ii sne is taken from starburst99 @xcite .",
    "it is known that the feedback from agns plays a significant role in the evolution of a central part of galaxy clusters .",
    "the agn feedback in the present simulations is incorporated following @xcite .",
    "black holes ( bhs ) of an initial seed mass @xmath24 are created when the gas mass density @xmath25 in a cell exceeds @xmath26 , with @xmath27 being the hydrogen mass .",
    "since the accretion onto bhs can not be resolved in the current simulations , their growth is empirically computed adopting the bondi - hoyle - lyttleton accretion rate @xmath28 .",
    "depending on the ratio @xmath29 relative to the eddington rate , the agn feedback is divided into two different modes . in the radio mode ( @xmath30 )",
    ", the feedback energy is ejected into a bipolar outflow with a jet velocity of @xmath31 km s@xmath15 following @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the feedback is in the quasar mode ( @xmath32 ) in which thermal energy is isotropically injected into gas .",
    "the first simulation , h@xmath7 , is a full hydrodynamic run with gas cooling and both sn and agn feedback .",
    "the second one , h@xmath8 , is a hydrodynamic simulation with gas cooling and sn feedback , but without agn feedback .",
    "finally h@xmath9 is a dark matter only run without baryon physics .",
    "the first is our main simulation , and the other two are used for reference to examine the effect of agn feedback and baryon physics .",
    "the three runs ( h@xmath7 , h@xmath8 , and h@xmath9 ) are performed using the the same initial conditions and sub - grid modeling .",
    "we extract all 40 halos with mass larger than @xmath33 from h@xmath7 using the adaptahop halofinder @xcite .",
    "since those halos are not spherical , we decided to characterize them in terms of @xmath34 , the mass of a sphere within which the mean density is 200 times the cosmic critical density at @xmath35 . in most cases ,",
    "the resulting value of @xmath34 is close to that defined by the adaptahop halofinder , but in some cases is smaller because of the presence of substructures .    in reality",
    ", the mass scale of the halos corresponds to that of groups and clusters of galaxies , but we simply call them clusters in what follows .",
    "the counterparts of the clusters in three different runs are identified as follows . since we start from the same initial conditions , each dark matter particle shares a common identity between the 3 simulations .",
    "if more than 75% of the member particles of a given halo from h@xmath7 are found in another halo from h@xmath8 and h@xmath9 runs , then we assume that these  redobjects are the counterparts of h@xmath7 run .",
    "indeed , we can find the counterparts for all the 40 clusters with this procedure .    in the following sections , we analyze the non - sphericity of xsb for the two sets of 40 clusters in h@xmath7   and h@xmath8 . for comparison",
    ", we also discuss the non - sphericity of dark matter halos for the three sets of 40 clusters .",
    "of course , no simulation is perfect , and h@xmath7 should be rather regarded as one of the most successful simulation runs . as we will show below , the non - sphericity of galaxy clusters is very sensitive to the baryon physics , and we have to keep in mind that h@xmath7 is nothing more than an empirically calibrated model at this point .",
    "nevertheless , h@xmath7 proves to be a very useful model that avoids several _ ad - hoc _ assumptions adopted in previous studies , and significantly improves the predictions of the non - sphericity of galaxy clusters .",
    "also the quantitative comparison with h@xmath8 and h@xmath9 clarifies the impact of baryon physics on gas , star , and dark matter distribution .",
    "reliable modeling of xsb of galaxy clusters crucially depends on baryon physics that is incorporated in the simulations .",
    "in particular , it is widely known that agn feedback plays an important role ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is also clear from the comparison between h@xmath7 and h@xmath8 .",
    "figure [ f5dtwo ] illustrates the density and temperature profiles of one simulated cluster ( @xmath36 ) in h@xmath8 .",
    "in the left - panel , we plot the density profiles of gas ( red ) , dark matter ( black ) , and stars ( blue ) .",
    "also , the ( mass - weighted ) gas temperature profile is shown in the right panel .",
    "both the strong excess of the central stellar and gas densities and the sudden decrease of the central gas temperature are inconsistent with the typical profiles of observed galaxy clusters , and should be ascribed to the unrealistic over - cooling of gas in the region .",
    "this indicates that the feedback from sne is not sufficient to stop star formation and gas - cooling in the central region .",

    "the stellar density exceeds the dark matter density inside @xmath37 10 kpc , corresponding to the typical galactic scale .",
    "the gas density profile is flat inside @xmath37 100 kpc , and does not exhibit a rapid increase unlike in figure [ f5dtwo ]",
    ". also , the gas temperature gradually increases toward the center , and the temperature at around @xmath38 is consistent with the observed mass - temperature relation @xcite .",
    "we use the mass tensor to estimate the non - sphericity of dark matter density distribution : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the mass and the projected position vector of the @xmath42-th particle within a given enclosed mass region ( specified by the value of @xmath43 ) .",

    "we show the axis ratio @xmath51 of xsb with a fixed value of @xmath45 ; @xmath52 , 0.2 , ... , 0.9 , and 1.0 .",
    "hence we attempt to derive @xmath51 from the dark matter component using the same values of @xmath53 , in order to make a direct comparison and with that from @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath50 is , however , defined for a fixed value of the enclosed mass , while the corresponding value of @xmath45 is not known in advance .",
    "we thus determine the axis ratios iteratively until the resultant value @xmath45 is converged within one percent .",
    "the same procedure is repeated for dark matter particles in h@xmath9 , h@xmath8 , and h@xmath7 .",
    "the non - sphericity of stellar mass density distribution in h@xmath8 and h@xmath7 is also estimated in the same fashion .",
    "the mass tensor defined by equation ( [ eq : masstensor ] ) can not be directly used to estimate the non - sphericity of xsb that is defined on grids , instead of particles .",

    "note that , over the typical temperature range of galaxy clusters ( 1 kev @xmath60 10 kev ) , @xmath57 is approximately proportional to @xmath61 , and therefore the shape of @xmath1 is largely determined by the gas density .    for each cluster , we calculate @xmath1 projected along the @xmath47- , @xmath48- , and @xmath49 axes according to equation ( [ e5sx ] ) .",

    "this can be a serious issue especially for low resolution simulations in which the different gas phases are not well resolved .",
    "we believe that this is not a problem for our present simulations because the gas densities are properly estimated on individual cells , and also the mass and spatial resolutions are significantly improved than those in their sph simulations",

    "this makes the total number of available measurements 169 .    since we have seen that @xmath85 is fairly insensitive to radius and mass in the previous section , we combine the results for all the four semi - major axis lengths @xmath52 , 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.4 .",
    "the range of @xmath53 is identical to that of @xcite .",
    "the resulting pdf is plotted in figure [ f5distq ] .",
    "the number of the cluster sample is 480 ( 40 halos @xmath96 3 lines - of - sight @xmath96 4 semi - major axis lengths ) for each simulation , but strictly speaking they are not necessarily independent .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)c5distqa.eps ( 80mm,80mm)c5distq.eps    in figure [ f5distq ] , the histogram corresponds to the pdf of @xmath88 for our simulated clusters . for comparison ,",
    "the pdf of @xmath80 is over - plotted in green dashed line .",
    "since the gas is supposed to trace the isopotential , instead of isodensity , surface of the total matter if hse holds , their difference is qualitatively well understood .",
    "we also note that the pdf of @xmath97 for the projected gas density ( magenta dotted lines ) directly calculated from the simulation is roughly the same as the pdf of @xmath85 ; while the projected gas density is proportional to @xmath98 and @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath99 , their shapes turn out to be roughly the same .",
    "as in @xcite , we find that the histogram of projected axis ratio is reasonably well approximated by the beta distribution : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the beta function and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the two fitting parameters",
    ". their best - fit values for the pdf of @xmath85 are @xmath104 for h@xmath8 and @xmath105 for h@xmath7 , which are over - plotted in thick red lines in figure [ f5distq ] .",
    "we also plot by the black solid curve the pdf of @xmath51 for isopotential surfaces based on the pdf of @xmath81 modeled by js02 assuming self - similar triaxial ellipsoids . as was shown in @xcite , the self - similar assumption of dark matter halos",
    "is not so accurate .",
    "therefore , the difference between the black solid curves and the green dashed lines is explained by the combination of the break - down of the self - similar assumption in js02 and the baryon effects .",
    "the above result implies that the quantitative comparison with observations requires the direct analysis of numerical simulations with appropriate baryon physics as we performed here .",
    "@xcite derived the pdf of @xmath85 from the observed 61 xmm - newton clusters ( plotted as blue crosses in figure [ f5distq ] ) , and attempted a preliminary comparison with the pdf for isopotential surfaces ( black solid curve ) based on the model of js02 .",
    "we can perform more quantitative comparison using the prediction based on our hydrodynamical simulation ( red histogram ) .    for that purpose",
    ", we use the cumulative pdf and apply the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test in order to avoid the binning effect due to the limited number of data . in general , the ks test is defined as follows .",
    "we consider an empirical distribution function @xmath106 , which is a cumulative distribution of @xmath107 samples of @xmath47 .",
    "then we consider a null hypothesis that `` @xmath106 is drawn from @xmath108 '' for any given cumulative distribution function @xmath108 .",
    "then the ks statistic @xmath109 is defined by @xmath110 it is known that the quantity @xmath111 obeys the following distribution independently of @xmath108 and @xmath106 : @xmath112 in addition , for a confidence level @xmath113 , @xmath114 is defined by @xmath115 . then ,",
    "if @xmath116 , the null hypothesis is rejected for the confidence level @xmath113 .    first we consider the observational data analyzed by @xcite and the prediction based on the isopotential surfaces of js02 model as @xmath106 and @xmath108 , respectively ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) .",
    "figure [ f5ks ] shows the cumulative pdfs of the observation data ( thin blue solid ) and the pdf of @xmath51 for the isopotential surfaces ( black dashed ) .",
    "note that the two panels show the results based on h@xmath8(left ) and h@xmath7(right ) , but these two lines ( blue and black ) are independent of simulations and thus the same for both panels . for these cumulative pdfs",
    ", we obtain @xmath119 , and the corresponding @xmath113 is less than @xmath120 .",
    "hence the pdf of @xmath51 for the isopotential surfaces is highly inconsistent with the observation data .",
    "we next compare the observation data with our simulation results . in this case",
    ", both distributions are constructed from finite samples , thus we consider a modification to the ks statistic ( [ eq : ks ] ) . for two empirical distribution functions , @xmath106 and @xmath121 respectively with @xmath107 and @xmath122 samples , the ks statistic can be generalized as@xmath123 then the quantity @xmath124 follows the same pdf as equation ( [ e5ksp ] ) .    in this case , we regard the distribution of @xmath51 for @xmath1 of our simulated clusters as @xmath121 ( @xmath117 and @xmath125 ) . the cumulative fraction for @xmath85 is shown in thick red line in figure [ f5ks ] for h@xmath8   ( left ) and h@xmath7 .",
    "for h@xmath8 , we obtain @xmath126 , and the corresponding @xmath113 is less than @xmath127 . on the other hand , for h@xmath7 , @xmath128 , and",
    "the corresponding @xmath113 is 0.10 .",
    "in other words , the probability that the observational data are drawn from the same distribution as our simulation results is 10 % for h@xmath7 , and less than 0.1 % for h@xmath8 .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)c5ksa.eps ( 80mm,80mm)c5ks.eps    the agreement of our h@xmath7   result against the observation is not perfect , but much better than that of the previous prediction based on the various inaccurate assumptions @xcite . thus we interpret this as promising and encouraging even though it is premature to put any further conclusion at this point . instead we would like to note that there still remain several issues that need to be carefully examined in both observations and simulations .",
    "the statistical significance of the present result is limited by the available number of observed clusters with high - quality imaging data . in particlar ,",
    "the observational data have much more weights at 0.1 and 0.2 @xmath53 , while simulation data have the same weight .",
    "also the mass ranges of the halos do not exactly match between observations and simulations , although the mass dependence is not so strong .",
    "such biases need to be taken into account carefully .",
    "the systematic uncertainty of the predictions is dominated by the reliable implementation of baryon physics .",
    "those issues will be improved with on - going and up - coming observational survey projects , and we plan to carry out systematic numerical simulations in order to address the reliability of the baryon physics modeling .",
    "we hope to report the progress elsewhere in due course .",
    "we have examined the non - sphericity of galaxy clusters using the projected axis ratios of x - ray surface brightness , star , and dark matter distributions ( @xmath85 , @xmath84 , and @xmath81 ) .",
    "we have extracted 40 clusters of mass larger than @xmath129 from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that fully incorporate baryon physics .    in general , we find @xmath130 , which is qualitatively understood by the fact that the gas roughly traces the isopotential , instead of isodensity , surface of the total matter .",
    "also our simulation indicates that @xmath131 , but this should be fairly sensitive to the baryon physics incorporated in the simulation .",
    "indeed , the baryon physics , in particular the agn feedback , has a significant impact on the non - sphericity of galaxy clusters . in terms of the",
    "spherically averaged _ dark matter _",
    "profile , the baryon physics is important only in the region less than @xmath132% of the virial radius of each clusters .",
    "nevertheless , its non - sphericity is affected even up to the half of the virial radius .",
    "for instance , the dark matter distribution becomes more spherical due to the baryon effect relative to the dark matter only simulations .",
    "also the trend of increasing ellipticity of dark matter distribution against the radius is opposite to that predicted from simulations neglecting baryon physics . only beyond the half of the virial radius ,",
    "the non - sphericity of dark matter distribution is not much affected by the baryon physics operating in the central region .",
    "this should be kept in mind even when weak - lensing analysis is used in order to measure the non - sphericity of dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "then we have measured the projected axis ratio of x - ray surface brightness , @xmath85 , for the 40 simulated clusters , and obtained its probability density function .",
    "the latter is very different from the previous prediction based on the projected isopotential surfaces of self - similar triaxial dark matter profiles @xcite , indicating the importance of the direct estimate from the numerical simulations .",
    "therefore our resulting pdf significantly improves the reliability of the prediction , which should be useful in future observational confrontation .    indeed while the previous prediction was not consistent with the observational data compiled by @xcite , our current improved prediction based on the hydro - simulation with the agn feedback exhibits much better agreement .",
    "this is interesting and promising , but we admit that it is not yet fully satisfactory : the statistics is severely limited by the available number of high - quality clusters in both observations and in simulations .",
    "furthermore the parameter dependence of the simulation , including cosmological parameters and empirical parameters that control the baryon processes , needs to be examined quantitatively .",
    "nevertheless our current study clearly indicates that the non - sphericity of galaxy clusters will serve as a useful quantitative probe of cosmology and cluster physics .",
    "the current methodology can be easily applied to the cluster sample from the sunyaev - zeldovich survey , e.g. , @xcite , and also in principle to weak - lensing @xcite .",
    "the joint analysis of x - ray surface brightness , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , and weak - lensing in an individual and/or statistical manner will provide an even more powerful approach to identify the nature of non - sphericity of galaxy clusters .",
    "future observational data and simulations will be able to test the cold dark matter scenario and baryon physics simultaneously through the non - sphericity of galaxy clusters in a complementary fashion to the conventional statistics based on spherically averaged quantities .",
