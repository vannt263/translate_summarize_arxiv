    "graphene is a two - dimensional ( 2d ) allotrope of carbon formed by a single layer of graphite that was first synthesized in 2004 @xcite .",
    "since then , graphene has attracted great attention due to the dirac - like spectrum of its charge carriers and the resulting extraordinary electronic properties @xcite .",
    "this fascinating material has remarkable electronic and mechanical properties @xcite .",
    "the electronic , chemical , thermal and mechanical properties of graphene are exceptionally sensitive to lattice imperfections @xcite and these defects and even the ripples that always cover suspended graphene sheets @xcite induce pseudo - magnetic gauge fields @xcite .",
    "thus the study of defects in graphene is crucial and it has generated important experimental work @xcite . among observed defects , there are pentagon - heptagon ( 5 - 7 ) pairs , stone - wales ( sw ) defects ( 5 - 7 - 7 - 5 defects ) @xcite , pentagon - octagon - pentagon ( 5 - 8 - 5 ) divacancies @xcite , asymmetric vacancies ( nonagon - pentagon or 9 - 5 pairs ) and more complicated groupings such as 5 - 7 - 7 - 5 and 7 - 5 - 5 - 7 adjacent pairs or defects comprising three pentagons , three heptagons and one hexagon @xcite . in other two",
    "dimensional ( 2d ) crystals such as boron nitride ( hbn ) symmetric vacancies have been observed @xcite",
    ".    real time observation of defect dynamics is possible using transmission electron microscopes ( tem ) corrected for aberration that have single atom resolution @xcite .",
    "defect dynamics in graphene occurs on a time scale of seconds @xcite , much longer than sub - picosecond time scales typical of sound propagation in a primitive cell . on this long time scale and for unstressed",
    "graphene , sw defects are unstable : their two 5 - 7 pairs glide towards each other and annihilate , and the same occurs to defects comprising three pentagons , three heptagons and one hexagon , whereas 5 - 7 - 7 - 5 and 7 - 5 - 5 - 7 adjacent pairs remain stable @xcite .",
    "in stressed graphene oxide samples , sw defects split into their component 5 - 7 pairs which then move apart @xcite . while most theoretical studies on the influence of defects in electronic properties assume a given defect configuration and then proceed to analyze its effects @xcite , it is important to predict defect stability and evolution .    in recent work ,",
    "we have explained the observed long time defect dynamics in graphene by considering defects as the core of edge dislocations or dislocation dipoles in a planar 2d hexagonal lattice @xcite .",
    "our theory is a top - down approach whose starting point is linear elasticity .",
    "we discretize continuum linear elasticity on a hexagonal lattice and replace differences of vector displacements along primitive directions by periodic functions thereof which are linear for small differences .",
    "our _ periodized discrete elasticity _ allows dislocation gliding along primitive directions and it reduces to continuum linear elasticity very far from dislocation cores @xcite . introducing a large damping in the resulting equations of motion and solving them numerically , we are able to predict the stable cores corresponding to a given dislocation configuration . using this theory , we have predicted the stability of 5 - 7 defects ( that are the cores of dislocations ) @xcite .",
    "similarly , a study of dislocation dipoles in unstressed samples @xcite predicts that sw are unstable whereas symmetric vacancies , divacancies and 7 - 5 - 5 - 7 defects are stable . in stressed samples ,",
    "our theory predicts that sw split into two 5 - 7 pairs that move apart @xcite , as confirmed later by experiments @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "our theory is used to explain the evolution of defects involving a pair of 5 - 7 - 7 - 5 and 7 - 5 - 5 - 7 defects and a defect comprising three heptagons , three pentagons and one hexagon as observed by meyer et al @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows . our theory and its equations of motion",
    "are explained in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "the stable cores corresponding to the far field of a single edge dislocation and a single dislocation dipole are used in section [ sec:3 ] to illustrate the way defects are constructed numerically .",

    "the governing equations of our theory are obtained in a three step process @xcite : ( i ) discretize ( 1 ) on the hexagonal graphene lattice , ( ii ) rewrite the discretized equations in primitive coordinates , and ( iii ) replace finite differences appearing in the equations by periodic functions thereof in such a way that the equations remain invariant if we displace the atoms one step along any of the primitive directions .",

    "<S> we use our theory of periodized discrete elasticity to characterize defects in graphene as the cores of dislocations or groups of dislocations . </S>",
    "<S> earlier numerical implementations of the theory predicted some of the simpler defect groupings observed in subsequent transmission electron microscope experiments . </S>",
    "<S> here we derive the more complicated defect groupings of three or four defect pairs from our theory , show that they correspond to the cores of two pairs of dislocation dipoles and ascertain their stability . </S>"
