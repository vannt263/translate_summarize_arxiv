    "there exist several extensions of the standard model ( sm ) in which the higgs boson decays dominantly into particles which can not be directly detected .",
    "one example is the standard model with a fourth generation@xcite , where the invisible decay mode @xmath0 may occur with a large branching fraction@xcite . in the case of supersymmetry",
    ", the higgs can decay with a large branching ratio into gravitinos or neutralinos or other neutral supersymmetric particles , see , for example @xcite .",
    "yet another possibility are models with large extra dimensions , see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite    searches for an invisible higgs at the lhc have been addressed recently in refs .",
    "one proposal is to observe such an ` invisible ' higgs in inelastic events with large missing transverse energy , @xmath8 , and two high @xmath9 jets@xcite . here",
    "the higgs boson is produced by @xmath10 fusion and therefore has large transverse momentum .",
    "however , in such a process , it is not possible to measure the mass of the boson .",
    "moreover even the quantum numbers are not known . other undetected neutral particles ( for example , neutrinos , photinos ) may be produced which carry away large @xmath8 . from this viewpoint central exclusive diffractive production , @xmath11 looks to be a much more favourable process , see , for example , ref .",
    "first , the mass @xmath12 can be accurately determined by observing the forward going protons and measuring the missing mass@xcite .",
    "the existence of the sharp peak in the missing mass spectrum dramatically reduces any background contributions .",
    "second , we have information about the quantum numbers of the object produced by pomeron - pomeron fusion : the boson must be neutral , colourless , flavourless and have natural parity , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 being by far the most likely@xcite .",
    "moreover , in some popular models ( in particular , the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) with large values of tan@xmath15@xcite ) the coupling of the higgs to @xmath16 bosons is suppressed while the coupling to gluons is enhanced@xcite .",
    "thus the inelastic production cross section with large missing @xmath9 is suppressed , while the exclusive signal is enhanced by about an order - of - magnitude as compared to the sm prediction@xcite .",
    "to illustrate the possibility of using central exclusive diffractive production , @xmath11 , to observe an invisible higgs @xmath17 we take a simple example .",
    "we consider the sm with an additional fourth generation of heavy fermions there are arguments , both from cosmology and astrophysics@xcite and from precision fits of electroweak data@xcite , in favour of the presence of a heavy fourth generation .. the mass of the heavy neutrino must be greater than @xmath18 , since it has not been seen in @xmath19-decays at lep - resonance shape shows that the fourth generation is excluded at 95% c.l . for @xmath20 gev@xcite . ] . on the other hand cosmological constraints imply that it can not be too heavy ; a mass greater a few tev is likely to be excluded .",
    "data on direct searches for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) in underground installations suggest that 4th neutrino mass is not much above 50 gev @xcite .",
    "we therefore take @xmath21 gev for our numerical estimates , and assume that all the other ( charged ) fermions of the fourth generation have masses above the experimental lower limits ; to be specific we assume that they are heavier than the top quark .",
    "in such a scenario the branching fractions of the higgs boson into the usual visible decay channels are suppressed due to the large @xmath0 decay width . in particular , for a higgs of mass 120 gev , the @xmath22 decay is reduced from the sm fraction of 68% to about 10% if there is a heavy fourth generation . on the other hand",
    "the @xmath23 coupling becomes about three times larger , as we now have three types of heavy quarks ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 quarks of the fourth generation and the top quark ) with @xmath26 .",
    "thus the central exclusive higgs production cross section is enhanced by up to a factor of 9 from the sm expectation , see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite . to calculate the cross sections for a range of higgs masses , we use the method described in refs .",
    "the results , at the lhc energy , are presented in table 1 .",
    "we show the total exclusive cross section , @xmath27 , and the visible component , @xmath28 , going through the @xmath29 decay .",

    "the suppression is compensated by the enhancement of the @xmath31 width by a factor of up to 9 . using the cuts and efficiences of ref .",
    "@xcite , we see , from the estimates given in that paper , that we expect about 10 @xmath32 events with a qcd @xmath29 background of 4 events which was called the mass resolution , is not the dispersion , @xmath33 , of the gaussian distribution over the missing mass , but rather the integration range for the signal . in order to detect",
    "95% of the signal @xmath34 should be equal to @xmath35 . therefore , if @xmath33 were equal to 1 gev , then the ratio of the signal will decrease by a factor of about 4 .",
    "] , for a luminosity @xmath36 .    however for higher higgs masses ( @xmath37 gev ) , the cross section , @xmath28 , for the visible @xmath29 signal appears to be too small to be observable at the lhc , at least for an integrated lumionsity of the order of @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "the exclusive cross section in the invisible higgs mode is still large enough to give a detectable event rate ; even for @xmath39 gev we have a cross section of nearly 4 fb .",
    "at first sight the best signal for an invisible higgs decay mode would be an ` empty event ' trigger with no deposition in the central detector ( cd ) . however elastic @xmath40 scattering gives a huge number of such events . for a luminosity of @xmath41 we would anticipate more than 20 million background events / sec , since @xmath42 mb .",
    "thus the only way to isolate signal events is to use information from the forward proton detectors , which register protons with a fraction @xmath43 of their incoming energy .",
    "if events are selected where both forward protons have lost some small fraction , @xmath44 , of their initial energy , then , first , the elastic interaction is eliminated , and , next , ( just by kinematics ) rapidity gaps ( @xmath45 ) are generated around the protons . in this case , the main background is generated by ` soft ' inelastic pomeron - pomeron fusion .",
    "up to a factor of two uncertainty , the cross section for the production of the central system of low @xmath46 particles , with the invariant mass @xmath47 in the range of 100 - 200 gev , is @xcite @xmath48 with a weak mass dependence . here",
    "@xmath49 are the rapidity intervals which separate the centrally produced system from the outgoing protons are the rapidity intervals between the respective proton ( with energy @xmath50 ) and the most energetic hadron in the central system with the same transverse mass ( @xmath51 ) and energy @xmath52 . for a light hadron at low @xmath46 , the intervals will be smaller by the constant amount @xmath53 . the mass and the c.m .",
    "rapidity of the centrally produced system are @xmath54 if we integrate over the available rapidity interval , @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , and account for the mass bin , @xmath57 gev , we find @xmath58 for a luminosity of @xmath59@xmath60sec@xmath61 , we thus have a rate of about 30 khz .    for the off - line analysis we would need to know only the momenta of the two tagged protons and that no other secondaries are produced .",
    "this is rather a limited amount of information and , ideally , we may even contemplate accumulating the information at 30 khz .",
    "moreover , one could decrease the rate by installing a veto detector to reject events containing secondaries in the central rapidity region .",
    "unfortunately , in practice , such an ideal experimental set - up is very difficult to achieve .",
    "the lhc general purpose detectors - cms and atlas - are designed , and optimised , for ` discovery physics ' with a high @xmath46 trigger in the central rapidity region .",
    "it is not possible to trigger on ` nothing ' with these detectors .",
    "in particular , there will always be noise in the calorimeters .    on the other hand , for the present purpose",
    ", it is not necessary to measure the momenta of these secondaries . at the trigger level",
    ", it would be sufficient to supplement the central detector with an additional simple detector just to suppress events in which new particles are emitted .",
    "indeed , at the trigger level , it would be enough to detect only charged ( or only neutral , say , photons ) particles in a limited rapidity interval , @xmath62 , not currently covered by the central calorimeter . at the final stage , in the off - line analysis the information from the central detector can be used to suppress the physical background more effectively .",
    "can we use information from the proton taggers for triggering ?",
    "this issue is under study by the experimental collaborations .",
    "various lhc beam optics are being considered@xcite , one of which would require forward proton detectors ( roman pots or microstations ) to be installed at about 300 - 400 m from the interaction point . due to their distant position , the signals from these proton taggers are delayed , and it is difficult to use them as a level-1 trigger .",
    "however future electronics may allow an extension of the trigger latency ( decision making time ) to 300 - 400 m. alternative beam optics , currently under investigation , which would avoid the above problem , is based on roman pots at about 200 m or less from the interaction point@xcite .",
    "so the situation is not resolved yet .",
    "note that due to ` pile - up ' events   that is several independent @xmath40 interactions in a single bunch crossing   it would be better to work at a relatively low luminosity . indeed , we need to collect only events which have no inelastic interaction in a bunch crossing . thus , assuming that a supplementary detector is used as a veto trigger , the effective luminosity appropriate for the level-1 trigger would be @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the average number of pile - up events at collider luminosity @xmath65 . for @xmath66",
    "we expect @xmath67 , which gives @xmath68 . as a result",
    "even at the level - one , the expected detection rate of the events with the rapidity gaps will be 10 times less , and the effective integrated luminosity would be @xmath69 , and not 30 @xmath70 ( as it is expected for the run with @xmath66 ) .",
    "if we would assume that the efficiency of tagging both the forward protons is @xmath71=  0.6 @xcite , then about 10 events should be registered for @xmath72 and @xmath73 gev .",
    "note that the maximal value of the effective luminosity , @xmath74 , is reached at a collider luminosity of @xmath75 .",
    "the crucial point for detecting an invisible higgs boson is the size of the background .",
    "the only signal which is detected for the process is the registration of the two outgoing protons with a fraction @xmath76 of the initial proton momentum just less than 1 ; typically @xmath77 0.01 .",
    "unfortunately an outgoing proton can loose part of its energy simply by qed radiation@xcite .",
    "the probability to emit a photon of energy @xmath78 is@xcite , [ eq : qed ] where @xmath79 is the transverse momentum of the outgoing proton of mass @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the qed coupling .",
    "thus the cross section for quasielastic scattering , @xmath82 , which may mimic a missing mass invisible higgs event , is |_y=0  ~   ( ) ^2  _",
    "el(pp )   3  pb . [ eq : qed2 ] to obtain this numerical estimate we assume an integration range of @xmath83 = 1 gev ( see @xcite ) and @xmath12 = 120 gev .",
    "we have also taken @xmath84 = 25 mb and @xmath85 at the lhc energy@xcite . to compare the background with the cross sections presented in table 1 we have to integrate ( [ eq : qed2 ] ) over the rapidity interval in which the higgs signal is collected .",
    "for instance , for a higgs of mass @xmath86 gev this interval is @xmath87 .",
    "the cross section of ( [ eq : qed2 ] ) therefore has to be integrated over the rapidity interval @xmath88 .",
    "thus we see the qed background cross section @xmath89 15 pb exceeds the invisible higgs signal , @xmath90 10 fb by almost a factor of 1500 .",
    "thus to suppress the qed background it is necessary to have forward veto electromagnetic calorimeters to detect the forward photons , with energies about @xmath9175 gev , with an efficiency better than about @xmath92 , that is 97% .",
    "this may be achieved , at least to some extent , by the cms detector by using its zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) , which may allow the detection of forward photons with energies above 50 gev .",
    "another source of background is double - diffractive dissociation , @xmath93 , where both the excited @xmath94 and @xmath95 systems contain a proton with @xmath96 .",
    "the selection @xmath97 means that we already have rapidity gaps between the forward protons and the central system .",
    "the main danger is to have ` quasi - elastic ' pomeron - pomeron scattering in the central region , @xmath98 where the hadrons @xmath99 may be , for example , the @xmath100 or @xmath101mesons or even a glueball .",
    "quantum numbers prevent a @xmath99 being a single pion .",
    "the quasi - elastic process produces low multiplicity events ( typically at least 4 pions ) with a third rapidity gap in the central region , as shown in fig.1 .    to estimate this background we use the model of ref .",
    "the cross section of the process shown in fig.1 is given by  ~   l_pp  =  1 - 100  nb , [ eq : dd1 ] where the effective pomeron - pomeron luminosity is@xcite @xmath102 the pomeron - pomeron cross section in a low mass ( resonance ) region is @xmath103 mb , and the ` elastic ' pomeron - pomeron scattering slope is @xmath104 .",
    "when we integrate over the available rapidity interval of the central system , @xmath56 , and account for the mass resolution , @xmath105 we find a background of @xmath106 an even more conservative",
    ". therefore the value @xmath107 mb claimed by ua8 should be considered as the product @xmath108 corresponding to a ` corrected ' @xmath109 mb . also note that the ua8 evaluation@xcite , @xmath110 nb , does not take into account the decrease in the survival probability of the rapidity gaps of the three - gap process ( by a factor 2 - 3 ) as we go from the energy , @xmath111 gev , of the ua8 experiment up to the lhc . ]",
    "evaluation , based on the effective pomeron - pomeron cross section @xmath112 mb measured by the ua8 collaboration@xcite , gives @xmath110nb .",
    "the centrally produced @xmath113 system will decay into at least 4 pions .",
    "thus we need to be sure that at least one of the four pions will be observed .",
    "that is the probability to detect one pion must be better than 1- ( ) ^  =  1  -  ( ) ^  ~  1  -  ( ) ^  ~   99% , [ eq : pion ] where @xmath114 is the ratio of the invisible higgs signal to the double - diffractive dissociation background . since",
    ", here , we have used @xmath115=300 nb , it is a very conservative estimate .",
    "even so , it appears to be a realistic requirement for the detection of the background .",
    "of course the suppression of the background will depend on the coverage of the detectors . in this connection , we note , that in the ` worst ' possible decay configuration , at least one pion must have rapidity @xmath116 , simply from kinematic considerations . , where @xmath12 and @xmath117 denote the mass and rapidity of the central system measured by the forward detectors ( see ( 2 ) ) . for the two slow pions the energies are around @xmath118 .",
    "the expected c.m .",
    "rapidities of these four pions are in the region of @xmath119 .",
    "] of course , a detailed evaluation of the size of the background will require a monte carlo simulation of the response of the available detectors to the double - diffractive dissociation events .",
    "we have shown that there is a good chance to observe a higgs boson which decays invisibly via central exclusive diffractive production , @xmath11 .",
    "contrary to conventional inelastic production , the mass of the higgs boson can be accurately measured by the missing - mass method .",
    "this is a crucial ingredient in reducing the background to the level of the signal .",
    "moreover for exclusive process , it is known that the produced object is flavourless and is a colour singlet . due to the ` pile - up ' problem",
    ", it will be most effective to work at luminosities in the range @xmath120 .    to suppress the background arising from qed radiation and/or soft double - diffractive dissociation , the central detector should be supplemented with forward calorimeters able to reject events with additional high energy photons and charged pions with energies in the range 5 - 200 gev . in order to reach a signal - to - background ratio @xmath121",
    ", these detectors should have an efficiency of photon or pion registration of typically 98% .",
