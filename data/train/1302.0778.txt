    "for this reason we admit into @xmath1 arrows without nodes which are elementary graphs , called wires ,   , and loops ( without nodes from the elementary graphs , nor leaves )        finally , we introduce an univalent gate , the termination gate :   .",

    "here it is explained the most important move in graphic lambda calculus : the graphic beta move .",
    "a move is a transformation of a graph into another .",
    "it is not a function from @xmath1 to @xmath1 though , as we shall see .",
    "the graphic beta move takes its name from the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lambda_calculus#beta_reduction[beta reduction in lambda calculus ] .",
    "consider the set @xmath1 with the equality of oriented , locally planar graphs ( with leaves not numbered ) , denoted by @xmath13",
    ".    a graphic beta move is a local move which consists in replacing a pattern ( sub - graph ) by another pattern .",
    "more precisely , we can apply the graphic beta move to any graph which contains a certain pattern ( sub - graph ) and we obtain a new graph , which is identical with the initial one , with the exception of the pattern , now replaced by the other pattern . in some figures , for clarity",
    ", we shall add a dashed closed curve which encircles the pattern which is subjected to the move .",
    "this is the convention followed in http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0332[arxiv:1207.0332 ] , @xcite .    1 .",
    "the graphic beta move .",
    "see the explanations after the figure .",
    "the labels `` 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 '' are used only as guides for gluing correctly the new pattern , after removing the old one .",
    "imagine that we have a graph which contains as a sub - graph the one from the left hand side ( lhs ) of the previous figure .",
    "then , by a graphic beta move , we may replace the pair of nodes from the lhs figure with two arrows , as indicated by the labelling `` 1,2,3,4 '' .",
    "the rest of the graph is unchanged .",
    "we may represent the graphic beta move like this :        up to the particular embedding in the plane of the graph from the right hand side ( rhs ) , the move is the same .",
    "the intersection of the `` 1,3 '' arrow with the `` 4,2 '' arrow is an artifact of the embedding , there is no node there .",
    "intersections of arrows have no meaning , remember that we work with graphs which are locally planar , not globally planar .",
    "the graphic beta move goes into both directions . referring to the first two pictures",
    ", we may pick a pair of arrows and label them with `` 1,2,3,4 '' , such that , according to the orientation of the arrows , `` 1 '' points to `` 3 '' and `` 4 '' points to `` 2 '' , without any node or label between `` 1 '' and `` 3 '' and between `` 4 '' and `` 2 '' respectively . then , by a graphic beta move , we may replace the portions of the two arrows which are between `` 1 '' and `` 3 '' , respectively between `` 4 '' and `` 2 '' , by the pattern from the lhs of the figure .",
    "here is an example .",
    "the red drawings have no meaning in the formalism , i have put them only to make a more clear representation of the move .",
    "remark that we may read the move from left to right , as well as from right to left .",
    "the dashed closed curve serves to mark the pattern .",
    "the graphic beta move may be applied to a single arrow , or to a loop , there is nothing which might stop this .",
    "for example , here are three applications of the graphic beta move :        in particular this gives a reason for considering loops and wires as members of @xmath1 .",
    "a point important to stress is that the graphic beta move is not dependent of the particular embedding into the plane of the graphs ( which we use when we draw the graphs ) .",
    "this will be important further , when we shall discuss about the crossing macros , see http://chorasimilarity.wordpress.com/2012/09/06/graphic-beta-rule-as-braiding/[graphic beta rule as braiding ] section [ graphicbetaruleasbraiding ] .    also , different labelling ( of the same graphs ) leads to different outcomes of the graphic beta move .",
    "this is explained in the next figure :        here `` a , b , c , d '' denote four graphs in @xmath1 .",
    "two possible graphic beta moves are depicted .",
    "let s read them from right to left .    at the right we have a graph with two arrows , connecting `` a '' with `` b '' and `` d '' with `` c '' .",
    "we may apply the graphic beta move to this graph in two ways , depending on the labelling of the arrows .",
    "if we mark the arrow from `` a '' to `` b '' with `` 1,3 '' and the arrow from `` d '' to `` c '' with `` 4,2 '' then we get the first graphic beta move",
    ". however , we may choose to mark the arrow from `` a '' to `` b '' with `` 4,2 '' and the arrow from `` d '' to `` c '' with `` 1,3 '' , applying then the graphic beta move .",
    "the outcome is different .    a particular case of the previous figure is yet another justification for having loops as elements in @xmath1 .",
    "these two applications of the graphic beta move may be represented alternatively like this :        a move which looks very much alike the graphic beta move is the unzip operation from the formalism of knotted trivalent graphs , see for example the paper http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0311458[the algebra of knotted trivalent graphs and turaev s shadow world ] by d.p .",
    "thurston , section 3 . in order to see this ,",
    "let s draw again the graphic beta move , this time without labelling the arrows :        the unzip operation acts only from left to right in the following figure .",
    "remarkably , it acts on trivalent graphs ( but not oriented ) .",
    "unzip is not a move in graphic lambda calculus .",
    "here are described the moves directly related to the @xmath7 gate .    1 .   co - comm move .",
    "this is the local move depicted in the following figure +     it means we may permute the outputs of a @xmath7 gate .",
    "the name means `` co - commutativity '' , because the diagram resembles to the one of the commutativity property , with the exception of the arrows orientations , which are in opposite directions ( hence `` co- '' ) .",
    "1 .   co - assoc move .",
    "this is a local move , described by the next figure +     it has the following effect : by using co - assoc moves , we may move between any two binary trees formed only with @xmath7 gates , with the same number of output leaves .",
    "the name means `` co - associativity '' and the explanation is similar to the previous one , with `` commutativity '' replaced by `` associativity '' .    1 .   global fan - out .",
    "this is a global move , because it involves a modification of an arbitrary number of nodes ( gates ) and arrows .",
    "precisely , the move acts like in the following picture : if @xmath4 is a graph in @xmath1 then we may replace the graph @xmath4 connected to an @xmath7 gate by two copies of @xmath4 .",
    "more specifically , the graph @xmath14 from the left hand side of the picture has to be connected only to the input of the @xmath15 gate , with no other connection to the rest of the graph which may be found outside the figured dashed curve .",
    "global fan - out implies co - comm ( namely two global fan - out moves have the effect of one co - comm move ) .",
    "the move co - comm is not useless though : we may choose to work in a sector of the graphic lambda calculus which uses co - comm but not global fan - out .",
    "there is a variant of this move which is local .    1 .   local fan - out .",
    "fix a number @xmath16 and consider only graphs @xmath4 which have at most @xmath16 ( nodes + arrows ) .",
    "the @xmath16 local fan - out move is the same as the global fan - out move , only it applies only to such graphs @xmath4 .",
    "local fan - out does not imply co - comm .",
    "[ [ important - remark ] ] important remark : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the gate @xmath7 is really a fan - out gate only in the sense described by the fan - out moves . in the absence of one of this moves , the gate can not be described as a `` fan - out '' .",
    "the `` fan - out '' is in the moves , not in the gate .",

    "conversely , if there is no oriented path connecting `` 2 '' with `` 1 '' then one may replace the edge with the graph from the left hand side of the following picture :        this move acts like eta - reduction when translated back from graphs to lambda calculus terms .",
    "`` ext '' comes from `` extensionality '' .",
    "let us see why we need to formulate the move like this .",
    "suppose that we eliminate the global condition `` there is no oriented path from ' ' 2 `` to ' ' 1 `` outside the left hand side of the previous picture '' .",

    "there is no contradiction though , unless we wish to decorate the edges ( i.e. to evaluate the result of the computation ) .",
    "it is just strange .",
    "there is one question left : why the move called `` ext2 '' , which is one of the emergent algebra moves , is also an extensionality move ?",
    "an answer is that the move ext2 says that the dilation of coefficient `` 1 '' is the identity _",
    "the moves of the graphic lambda calculus are independent of the particular embeddings of trivalent graphs into the plane",
    ". this may not be obvious from the figures which explain the moves , but it is so after further inspection .",
    "let us look again at the graphic beta move .",
    "in fact , this is a move which transforms a pair of edges ( from the right of the picture ) into the graph from the left of the picture . the fact that the edges intersect in the figure is irrelevant .",
    "what matters is that , for the sake of performing the move , one edge is temporarily decorated with 1 - 3 and the other with 4 - 2 .    here",
    "are two more equivalent depictions of the same rule , coming from different choices of 1 - 3 , 4 - 2 decorations .",
    "we may see the graphic beta move as        but also as        let me then make some notations of the figures from the left hand sides of the previous diagrams . here",
    "they are : for the first figure we introduce the ( lambda calculus ) `` crossing macro ''        and for the second figure the other ( lambda calculus ) `` crossing macro '' :        with these notations the graphic beta move may be see as this braiding operation        or as this other braiding operation        these are notations , or macros in a more technical language , which encode the performing of the graphic beta move in a particular embedding ( of the graph ) in the plane .",
    "as such , they look dependent of the particular embedding , but the crossings satisfy the reidemeister moves for knot diagrams , as explained in http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1604[arxiv:1211.1604 ] , @xcite , therefore this notation system is independent of the change of embedding of the graphs in the 3-dim space !",

    "if we look at the graph from the right hand side , then we see we can apply a beta move , like this :        therefore the dual of the extended extended beta move is equivalent with this curious looking move :        this move looks like a pruning move but it is not on the list .",
    "we reason like this : by using the extended beta move and the reidemeister 2 move ( for emergent algebras ) we arrive at        we may repeat indefinitely this succesion of moves , or , alternatively , we may use the extended beta move with an arbitrary @xmath37 from the group @xmath10 .",
    "the intuition behind this is that the gate @xmath8 is a dilation gate , which has an input coming from the fan - out gate and the other connected to the output of the gate , therefore , by circulating along this loop , we apply an endless number of dilations of coefficient @xmath28 . at the limit ( if such a concept makes sense at this level of generality ) , either the things blow to infinity ( if @xmath38 ) or they implode to the value given by the fan - out gate(if @xmath39 ) , or they circulate forever in a loop ( if @xmath32 ) . in all cases",
    "the graph with only one input and no outputs , which we see in the previous figure , behaves exactly like the termination gate !",
    "therefore , we may as well eliminate the termination gate and replace it in all the formalism by the gate from the previous figure .        by this replacement",
    "the `` dual extended beta move '' is true , as a consequence of the usual graphic beta move .",
    "moreover , if we do this replacement , then we shall have pure trivalent graphs in the formalism because the ugly univalent termination gate is replaced by a trivalent graph !    on the other side ,",
    "let us look again at the mystery move .",
    "the graph from the left hand side can be expressed by using the ( emergent algebra ) crossing macros :        this form of the graph makes obvious where to apply the extended beta move .",
    "let s see what we get .",
    "therefore it looks like the mystery move is a combination of the extended beta move and elimination of loops .",
    "there is no need to replace the termination gate by a trivalent graph , as suggested in the previous post , although that is an idea worthy of further exploration .",
    "here are some particular applications of the dual of the graphic beta move .",
    "the first is this :                                                  m. buliga , braided spaces with dilations and sub - riemannian symmetric spaces , in : geometry .",

    "<S> however , the graphic lambda calculus presented here is different , for several reasons , among them because of the connections with knot diagrams ( first explained in the post http://chorasimilarity.wordpress.com/2012/10/26/3d-crossings-in-graphic-lambda-calculus/[3d grossings in graphic lambda calculus ] , the beta reduction is a braiding operation ) , because of the attention to local and global moves and sets of graphs ( terms ) and because of the connection with emergent algebras and differential calculus in metric spaces .    a detailed discussion about the relations between this graphic lambda calculus and others would be very useful .    </S>",
