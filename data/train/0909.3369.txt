    "it seems that there is now an agreement that construction of a quantum game can be achieved along several possible routes meyerdavid , ewl , marinattoweber , piotrowski , cheontsutsui , iqbalcheon , bleiler1,bleiler2 .",
    "the unifying idea underpinning these routes appears to consist of establishing a link between the classical feature of a physical system , shared by participating players and that facilitates the physical implementation of the game , and the classical game , so that a classical game results because of those features .",
    "it turns out that this link takes the form of constraints placed on the ( statistical ) properties of the shared physical system . a quantum game",
    "is then obtained by replacing the classical features of the shared physical system with the quantum ones , while retaining the mentioned link .",
    "subsequently , one investigates the impact the quantum feature(s ) may have on the solution / outcome of the game .    as the mentioned link between the classical features of shared physical system and the resulting classical game",
    "can be established in several possible ways , there can exist many routes in obtaining a quantum game . in the context of non - cooperative games",
    "this results in an interesting situation that one route to quantize a game can provide a new quantum mechanical nash equilibrium ( ne ) that is different from the one which another quantization route provides . in bleiler",
    "s words @xcite comparing one route to another is similar to comparing apples and oranges .",
    "for instance , in eisert et al.s scheme @xcite for quantizing a game , the classical game corresponds to an initial product quantum state , which the players share for its local unitary manipulation and its later measurement . in marinatto and weber s ( mw ) quantization scheme",
    "marinattoweber the classical game corresponds to the product initial state @xmath0 , as a pure state is forwarded to player for its local manipulation by the identity @xmath1 and pauli @xmath2 operators before the final state is measured .",
    "the link that eisert et al.s quantization scheme establishes between the classical game and a product initial state ( representing the ` classicality ' of shared physical system ) does not seem entirely convincing .",
    "it is because a product initial state leads to a classical game but the classical game can also result when players locally maneuver a maximally entangled state with special unitary actions .",
    "likewise , the relationship which the mw s scheme establishes between the classical game and the product initial state @xmath3 does not appear convincing as a quantum game can correspond to a pure initial state that does not violate bell s inequality .",
    "it is true that in these quantization schemes a classical game is embedded in the quantum game , but the respective embeddings do not ensure that a quantum game results only when relevant bell s inequalities are violated . along with these observations , benjamin and",
    "hayden @xcite pointed out that in the eisert et al.s quantization scheme players unitary actions are arbitrarily restricted and are not even closed under composition . also , referring to the same quantization formalism , flitney and hollenberg @xcite pointed out that the new ne and the classical - quantum transitions that occur are simply an artifact of the particular strategy space chosen .",
    "also , enk and pike s @xcite remarked that as the scheme involves players having access to strategy sets that are not available to them in the classical game , it makes sense to equate the quantum game to an extended classical game constructed by adding extra pure strategies in the game matrix .    in an effort to reply to these observations we proposed iqbalweigert , iqbalcheon , iqbalcheonabbott , iqbalabbott the setting of a quantum correlation experiment @xcite for playing a quantum game .",
    "the quantum game is played between two remotely located agents / observers alice and bob who can perform measurements on parts of a particle that has disintegrated into two .",
    "alice and bob each are given two directions in which measurements are performed . in a run , each agent performs a measurement along one of the two directions , whose outcome is a dichotomic variable .",
    "a players strategy is the probability distribution of choosing between the two available directions .",
    "a quantum correlation experiment seems to provide a natural setting for a two - player two - strategy ( @xmath4 ) quantum game .",
    "it is because a player has to decide a pure strategy in each run and the probability distribution over pure strategies defines a player s ( mixed ) strategy that is definable over many runs . referring to the quantum correlation experiment",
    ", we can identify the agents alice and bob as players and assign the two available directions to correspond to a player s pure strategies .",
    "players payoffs are then expressed in terms of the joint probabilities relevant to the shared physical systems , their moves or strategies , and the entries in the matrix that defines the game .    in the present paper",
    "we present a new approach for construction of quantum games that , once again , uses the setting of quantum correlation experiments .",
    "we propose that a quantum game corresponding to a classical game should satisfy the following two requirements : a ) so as to avoid enk and pike type argumentation @xcite the strategy sets available to the players are identical in both the quantum and the corresponding classical game , b ) the quantization procedure should establish a convincing relation between the classicality of the shared physical system , as it is expressed by a relevant system of bell s inequalities @xcite , and the classical game .",
    "we show that when the classicality of a shared physical system is defined busch in terms of a system of bell s inequalities it allows us to establish such a relationship .",
    "we refer , in this connection , to the results reported by fine @xcite in early 1980s and build up our arguments on them .",
    "these results are known to be significant with reference to joint distributions , quantum correlations , and a system of bell s inequalities , all of which are relevant to the setting of quantum correlation experiments that we use to play quantum games .",

    "for instance , we use @xmath10 to denote alice s payoff when she plays @xmath11 while bob plays @xmath12 , which is @xmath13 from the table ( [ matrix ] ) . in a mixed - strategy game , we denote by @xmath14 the probability with which alice chooses her pure strategy @xmath15 .",
    "she then chooses @xmath11 with the probability @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , we denote by @xmath17 the probability with which bob chooses @xmath12 .",
    "he then chooses @xmath18 with the probability @xmath19 . in this case",
    "we write alice s payoff by @xmath20 and bob s payoff by @xmath21 i.e. the first entry in bracket is for alice and the second for bob . for a symmetric game",
    "we have @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 , for which one obtains @xmath26 .",
    "the inequalities    @xmath27    describe that the strategy pair @xmath28 is a ne .",
    "in the setting of quantum correlation experiments  @xcite , which we use to play a quantum version of the game ( [ matrix ] ) , players alice and bob are located in space - time regions @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "ideally these regions are spacelike separated .",
    "alice can perform measurements on two bivalent observables ( with values @xmath31 ) @xmath32 and @xmath33 in region @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , player bob can perform measurements on two bivalent observables ( with values @xmath31 ) @xmath34 and @xmath35 in region @xmath30 .",

    "for the matrix game ( [ matrix ] ) played in the setting of quantum correlation experiments the payoff relations are expressed @xcite as    @xmath50 ^{t}\\left [   \\begin{array}{cc } \\pi _ { a , b}(s_{1},s_{1}^{\\prime } ) & \\pi _ { a , b}(s_{1},s_{2}^{\\prime } ) \\\\",

    "we define    @xmath54    where @xmath55 , for example , is shortened notation for @xmath56the entries in the matrix ( [ matrix ] ) .",
    "although players payoffs ( [ payoffs ] ) depend on the joint probabilities corresponding to the shared physical system , the players moves , represented by @xmath14 and @xmath17 , are independent of them .",
    "players moves in the quantum game are classical in being a linear combination ( with real & normalized coefficients ) of the two choices available to each player . however , in contrast to the situation in a classical game ( in which the chosen strategies directly determine the payoff entries in the payoff matrix ) , our setting demands that players payoffs not only depend on their moves but also that these depend on what kind of physical system players share in order to play the game .",
    "we achieve this by making the payoff relations to depend also on the joint probabilities relevant to the shared physical system and then ask whether a joint probability distribution exists . as for",
    "a quantum mechanical shared physical system the joint probabilities can go beyond the constraints permitted to classical joint probabilities , allowing us to obtain our quantum game .",

    "we believe it is because non - factorizability is not equivalent to a joint probability distribution @xmath71 not existing  a situation that motivates this paper .",
    "this analysis confirms that an outcome of a quantum game is dependent on the quantization route taken .",
    "the results obtained show that for quantum games played in the setting of quantum correlation experiments the sharing of quantum resources does not always lead to players doing better than what they can do in the classical game .",
    "players sharing a quantum system ( for which bell s inequalities are violated ) do not automatically become better off relative to the ones who share classical system in order to physically implement the same game .",
    "this is observed to be the case with the game of pd . on the contrary , for the game of mp",
    "the situation becomes quite different as players sharing of the quantum system ( that corresponds to a maximally entangled state ) leads to the situation of any pair of strategies existing as ne .",
    "it , therefore , shows that the consequence of sharing of a quantum system depends on the particular original classical game the players play .",

    "@xcite showing that within eisert et al.s quantization scheme @xcite certain quantum states can not be used to quantize certain classical games as by doing so classical results can not be reproduced .",
    "our results convey the same message though the quantum games we consider are constructed directly from bell s inequalities .",
    "an interesting question is to ask about the consequence the new quantum solutions have regarding the original considered game .",
    "we believe that the new quantum solutions have a consequence regarding the original considered game only when a classical game emerges due to classicality of the shared physical system  in the sense that when the shared physical system does not violate bell s inequalities the resulting game attains a classical interpretation ( both in terms of the players payoffs and the resulting pair of strategies defining the ne ) .    some of the known criticisms of quantum games can be stated as follows :",
    "a ) a quantum game is an ad - hoc construction that does not teach us anything new about quantum mechanics , b ) it is known in game theory that if you change the rules of an old game , you get a new game .",
    "the fact that new ne appear in the quantum game is not surprising and does not imply anything about the old game , c ) by including the new ` quantum ' moves in a pay - off matrix , one can reformulate the quantum game as a purely classical game @xcite with players having access to an extended set of available pure strategies .",
    "in reply to a ) we state that a quantum game offers a reasonable way to extend a classical game towards quantum domain and such an extension can not , and should not , be assumed to open new avenues for quantum mechanics .",
    "however , it is the game theory for which a new avenue is opened in that taking a game to the quantum regime is found to have consequences for the outcome the considered game . in reply to b )",
    "we state that any construction of a quantum game is an extension of the original game and therefore the rules for playing this extended game also need to take into account the particular extension made",
    ". the rules of the extended game are relevant to the new game and therefore can not be expected to remain identical to the ones in the original game . under reasonable conditions , however , the extended game and its rules , should be reducible to the original game . in the construction",
    "we develop here , the reasonable constraints are a system of bell s inequalities . in reply to c )",
    "we state that as in the present construction a quantum game corresponds only when bell s inequalities , relevant to the shared physical system , are violated , and that the classical game corresponds when this system holds .",
    "as players strategies remain classical in the quantum game , this offers the closest situation without changing the rules of the game  especially when compared to the usual case in which players allowed strategy sets are extended to unitary transformations .    in the setting we use ,",
    "the players strategies become dependent on the shared physical system via the payoff relations . for a shared system that exhibits quantum correlations",
    ", this may give the impression that the game is changed from a non - cooperative game to a cooperative game with different rules .",
    "we agree that it is possible to model our quantum game by introducing , for instance , pre - play negotiations into the standard setting of a non - cooperative game .",
    "our objective , however , is different in that we ask how the violation of bell s inequalities by the shared physical system impacts the outcome of a non - cooperative game .",
    "the possibility of modeling this impact by introducing some kind of cooperation between the players can not be equated to changing a non - cooperative game into an explicitly cooperative game .",
    "agreeing with the earlier reported results benjaminhaydenc , benjaminhayden , johnson , shimamura , shimamura2,mendes this paper shows that players sharing a quantum mechanical system may or may result in new outcomes as this depends on the original classical game . secondly ,",
    "we present the first analysis that directly exploits a system of bell s inequalities , together with fine s results , establishing a direct link between a system of bell s inequalities and the existence of a joint probability distribution in the construction of quantum games .",
    "possible directions for further investigation may include expressing the outcome(s ) of a quantum game in terms of the amount of the violation of bell s inequalities such that they are reduced to classical outcomes when there exists no violation .",
    "we believe the quantization approach proposed in this paper can be extended to multi - player games if fine s results could be accordingly extended to more than @xmath184 bivalent observables ."
