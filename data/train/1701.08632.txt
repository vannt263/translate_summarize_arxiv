    "it has now become an accepted fact that the expansion of the universe is accelerating due to an exotic energy source having large negative pressure called dark energy ( de ) .",
    "but the mystery is that , a little is known about dark energy : it violates strong energy condition and can cluster at large scale .",
    "moreover de does not interact with baryonic matter and therefore making it difficult to detect .",
    "it dominates the present universe and was less effective in early time .",
    "recent planck results estimate a lion share of @xmath0 for de in the cosmic mass energy budget @xcite .",
    "the natural choice for de is the cosmological constant but it suffers from many puzzles like the fine tuning and coincidence problem .",
    "therefore many dynamically varying de candidates have been proposed in literature ( for details see refs.@xcite for reviews ) .",
    "observations have confirmed that the cosmic speed up is a late time phenomena and has occurred at a redshift of the order @xmath1 .",
    "this indicates that , the universe has undergone a transition from a decelerated phase of expansion to an accelerating state in recent past .",
    "this cosmic transit phenomenon speculates an evolving deceleration parameter with a signature flipping .",
    "the rate at which the transition occurs usually determines the transit redshift @xmath2 .",
    "the standard cosmological model is based upon the assumption of large scale isotropy and homogeneity of space .",
    "however , one can expect small scale anisotropies in the universe in view of the observations of temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation data from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) and planck .",
    "these data show some non trivial topology of the large scale cosmic geometry with asymmetric expansion @xcite .",
    "planck data also show a slight redshit of the power spectrum from exact scale invariance .",
    "though the standard @xmath3cdm model is well supported by different measurements , at least at low multipoles , it does not fit to the temperature power spectrum data @xcite .",
    "dark energy is also believed to be associated with the breakdown of global isotropy and can display anisotropic features @xcite . employing the union compilation of type ia supernovae , cook and lynden - bell found that a weak anisotropy in dark energy , mostly observable for higher redshift group with @xmath4 , directed roughly towards the cosmic microwave background dipole @xcite .",
    "while friedman models ( frw ) in the framework of general relativity ( gr ) provide satisfactory explanations to various issues in cosmology , bianchi type models have been constructed in recent times to handle the smallness in the angular power spectrum of temperature anisotropy @xcite . moreover , bianchi type models are the generalisation of the frw models where the spatial isotropy is relaxed .    as a sequel to our previous studies on the dynamical behaviour of pressure anisotropies @xcite , in the present work , we have considered a general form of non interacting dark energy with anisotropic pressures along different spatial directions and have investigated the effect of anisotropic components on the dark energy density parameter and the equation of state .",
    "in addition to the anisotropic de fluid , cosmic strings aligned along x - direction are also considered to incorporate some anisotropic effect .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we discuss the basic formalism of an anisotropic dark energy . the effect of anisotropy on dark energy and the de equation of state ( eos ) parameter is discussed in sect . 3 and we summarize our results in sect .",
    "we consider a spatially homogeneous and anisotropic bianchi v ( bv ) space time in the form    @xmath5    where , the directional scale factors @xmath6 are functions of cosmic time only , @xmath7 . in general , @xmath6s are considered to be different and thereby provide a description for anisotropic expansions along the three orthogonal directions .",
    "the model reduces to frw model when the directional scale factors become equal . here , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 being a non zero arbitrary constant .",
    "we choose the unit system such that @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the newtonian gravitational constant and @xmath13 is the speed of light .",
    "the energy momentum tensor for a given environment of two non interacting fluids is given by    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively denote the contribution to energy momentum tensor from one dimensional cosmic strings and de .",
    "for a cosmic fluid containing one dimensional strings @xcite , the energy momentum tensor is    @xmath17    where @xmath18 ( along x- direction ) . in a co moving coordinate system",

    "@xmath21 is the proper energy density and is composed of energy density due to massive particles and the string tension density @xmath22 . in the absence of any string phase , the total contribution to the baryonic energy density comes from particles only .",
    "in contrast to the isotropic pressure of usual cosmic fluid , we wish to incorporate some degree of anisotropy in the de pressure and consider the energy momentum tensor for de as    @xmath23 \\nonumber\\\\                % & = & diag[-1 , \\omega_{de_x},\\omega_{de_y},\\omega_{de_z}]\\rho_{de}\\\\ \\nonumber                & = & diag[-1 , \\omega_{d}+\\delta,\\omega_{d}+\\gamma,\\omega_{d}+\\eta]\\rho_{d } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 is the de equation of state parameter ( eos ) and @xmath25 is the de density .",

    "one can note that , anisotropy is incorporated in two different manner in the field equations : one due to the inherent anisotropy de pressure and the other through the presence of aligned cosmic strings along x - axis .",
    "these anisotropic components leads to the anisotropy in the cosmic geometry described through the bv space time .",

    "one should note that , the evolutionary behaviour of the pressure anisotropies and the de eos depend on the assumed dynamics of the present day universe .",
    "in particular , if we have a presumed dynamics of the universe in the form of a scale factor pertaining to the late time cosmic speed up , the background cosmology can be well studied .",
    "consequently , the evolutionary behaviour of these properties can be well assessed . in view of this ,",
    "in the present work , we consider a hybrid scale factor ( as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that can simulate a transit universe from a decelerated phase to an accelerated phase .",
    "it has been a usual practice to consider the scale factor to behave either as de sitter type expansion or as the power law expansion .",
    "both the power law and exponential law of the scale factor lead to a constant deceleration parameter .",
    "however , the belief that , the universe has undergone a transition from a decelerated phase of expansion to an accelerated one requires the deceleration parameter to evolve from some positive values at remote past to negative values at late phase of cosmic evolution .",
    "such a behaviour can be generated by a hybrid scale factor @xcite .",
    "the hybrid scale factor behaves as power law in the early cosmic phase and as de sitter type at late phase of cosmic acceleration .",
    "it is expressed through two adjustable parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "for this model , the hubble parameter is expressed as @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , tripathy @xcite has considered a general form @xmath90 of the hubble parameter to address the role of skewness in anisotropic models where @xmath91 is a positive constant .",
    "the present case can be considered as a special case of that in ref .",
    "the deceleration parameter for this model is obtained as @xmath92 .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 can be constrained in the range @xmath93 from simple arguments but @xmath86 can be constrained from a detailed analysis of @xmath94 data @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we consider the same range for @xmath87 and leave @xmath86 as an open parameter .",
    "the deceleration parameter generated by a hybrid scale factor is shown in fig.1 .",
    "deceleration parameter for power law cosmology and de sitter type expansion have also been shown in the figure for comparison .",
    "the deceleration parameter for hybrid scale factor evolves from positive values at past epochs to negative values at late time .",
    "the transition from deceleration to acceleration occurs at some transition redshift @xmath2 which is decided by the parameter @xmath86 . in the present work ,",
    "we have considered two representative values of @xmath86 i.e. @xmath95 and @xmath96 corresponding to @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively .",
    "it is clear from the figure that at an early time , the behaviour is dominated by the power law factor and the exponential factor dominates at late times .",
    "the rate of transition depends on the parameter @xmath86 ; transition is faster for higher value of @xmath86 .     as a function of redshift . ]",
    "the de density parameter has contributions from the anisotropic aspects of the model and the matter field ( including the string tension density ) .",
    "for an isotropic model with @xmath73 , the anisotropic part @xmath74 becomes 1 ( refer to eq . ) .",
    "it is obvious that at remote past , the matter field has a dominant contribution whereas at late phase of cosmic evolution the dark energy dominates . with an increase in the geometrical anisotropy through an increase in the parameter @xmath48 , @xmath74 decreases from its isotopic value of 1 but the contributions from matter field and curvature part remain the same .",
    "this indicates that , with an increase in the value of @xmath48 , there occurs a decrease in the value @xmath99 at a given redshift .",
    "this feature of the de density parameter is clearly visible in fig.2 , where we have shown @xmath99 as a function of redshift for some representative values of @xmath48 .    in order to investigate the effect of string phase on de density parameter , we have considered three different values of @xmath62 namely @xmath100 and @xmath101 corresponding to no string phase , nambu strings and geometric string phase respectively .",
    "presence of string phase incorporates some kind of anisotropy .",

    "are shown either in presence or in absence of cosmic strings .",
    "one can note that , in absence of cosmic strings ( dotted lines in the figure ) , the skewness parameters show almost a non evolving behaviour in most of the past epochs and evolve at late phase of cosmic time .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath28 assume negative values whereas @xmath27 assumes positive values during the evolutionary process .",
    "the anisotropy in the de pressure along x - direction is almost unaffected by cosmic expansion .",

    "the de pressure along z - direction is least affected .",
    "the reason behind the sensitivity of @xmath26 to the presence of cosmic strings may be due to the fact that , we have considered the strings to align along x - direction .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of anisotropy parameter @xmath48 on pressure anisotropies .",
    "it is found that , a variation of @xmath48 , in the given range , does not have any significant effect on the overall behaviour of the skewness parameters .",

    "@xmath106 is not sensitive to the choice of the parameter @xmath48 at least at cosmic times spanning from some recent past to late phase .",
    "however , at early times the choice of @xmath48 may weakly affect the dynamics .",
    "in view of this , in the figure we have considered a representative value @xmath107 and examined the dynamics in presence of cosmic strings .",
    "it is obvious that , at a late phase of cosmic expansion , the dark energy strongly dominates even in the presence of cosmic strings and therefore , the de eos is not affected by string anisotropy .",
    "but at an early phase , the cosmic string has a substantial contribution to the density parameter and therefore , the dynamics of de eos is greatly affected . in the absence of any cosmic strings",
    ", the model behaves like quintessence field and the de eos smoothly decreases in the quintessence region . with an increase in string tension density ,",
    "the model gathers some amount of energy in the early phase to behave differently . in such cases , the de eos first increases with cosmic time and then decreases .",
    "in the present work , we have investigated the role of anisotropic components on the dynamical aspects of dark energy .",

    "the parameters of the hybrid scale factor have been fixed from some physical basis .",
    "an increase in the anisotropic parameter decreases the de density parameter and therefore shares some of the burden to provide an acceleration .",
    "presence of string phase substantially modifies the de density at early epoch .",
    "the anisotropy in de pressure continues along with the cosmic expansion and grows a bit rapidly at a later period . in general , the pressure anisotropies along different directions increase in the early phase dominated by cosmic strings . along the x - direction ,",
