    "any possible uncertainties in interstellar extinction are not as important in ir radiation as they are in the optical range , but we observe much bigger scatter in the dust component luminosities than that in stellar components .",
    "this may mean that the dust phenomenon in the most massive evolved stars is quite temporary , and that the dust components must be variable on scales much less than those of core evolution .",
    "one may conclude that the dust activity of lbv and related stars follows the strong eruptions ( at time scale of tens , or possibly , hundreds of years ) , as was detected in vara in 19501953 @xcite .",
    "the new star n93351 has properties intermediate between the lbvs and vara , in the same time it has a hot photosphere , lbv - like luminosity and an extensive curcumstellar material .",
