    "some of these details are not yet fully understood , and observational evidence is fundamental to constraint structure formation and evolution models , specially because faint galaxies are more sensitive to astrophysical processes like supernova feedback and ram pressure stripping . in particular , statistical studies of systems of galaxies are key to understand the transformations of galaxies due to the interactions between galaxies and their environment @xcite .",
    "although the formation of a galaxy is believed to take place on the potential well of a dark matter halo , not all haloes host a galaxy . as pointed out first by @xcite ,",
    "the number of halos in numerical simulations were an order of magnitude greater than the observed number of satellites in the local group @xcite .",

    "the background subtraction methodology are based on the simple idea of counting the number of objects in a region where a given signal is expected to lie , superposed to an uncorrelated noise , and subtracting a statistical estimation of that noise . in this case , the signal is due to the presence of satellite galaxies in systems dominated by a central and luminous galaxy , and the noise is associated to the background and foreground galaxies not dynamically linked to the primary galaxy",
    ". then , it allows to statistically obtain properties of the faint galaxies associated to the primaries , without the need of redshift information for individual objects .",
    "this is accomplished provided that the working hypothesis of the central primary is satisfied , and convenient ranges of observed parameters are chosen , so that to minimize the contribution of background counts .",
    "although the method does not allow to quantify the contribution to the signal of each individual object , it is possible to obtain statistical estimates of probability density distributions describing galaxy properties .",
    "this is accomplished by restricting galaxies to a fixed bin of the variable , for instance the luminosity of the satellite or their distance to the central galaxy , and normalizing to the number of contributing systems in that bin , after implementing the background subtraction .    within the hierarchical clustering paradigm",
    ", the matter distribution can be roughly described by a set of halos populated with galaxies , according to certain recipes that depend on galaxy type @xcite .",
    "this model can give insight to adopt an appropriate choice of the centers , which is key to increase the signal from the satellite population against the background noise and obtain reliable results using this method .",
    "central galaxies play a different role than the rest of objects within the halo due to its particular accretion history , related to the merging of massive galaxies in each halo , and eventually the accretion of most of the available gas and even other minor galaxies @xcite . while galactic cannibalism has been proposed as the main mechanism for building up central galaxies @xcite , it has also been suggested that major mergers @xcite and dry mergers @xcite play an important role in the different stages of their evolution . from a dynamic point of view , relative velocities of central galaxies with respect to the halos in which they reside are very small , compared to the large velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies .",
    "this leads to a clear observational distinction between central and satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "it is also known that a central galaxy is often the most luminous galaxy within their halo @xcite .",
    "even when this  central galaxy paradigm  has been claimed to be inaccurate @xcite , specially in high mass systems , the precise location of the center of the halo is not crucial for the implementation of the method , since it integrates galaxy counts in a region where overdensity signal is clearly present .",
    "still , the location of the brightest galaxy in this special type of galaxy systems , where a galaxy strongly dominates in luminosity and the total mass of the systems is quite low , is a very good approximation to the position of the center of the galaxy system . under these assumptions ,",
    "the brightest galaxies are expected to reside in the centers of haloes @xcite , and can be used statistically to analyze galaxy overdensities associated to satellites .",
    "accordingly , we limit the sample of centers to bright isolated galaxies , since they are likely central galaxies of small haloes .",
    "the main requirement for the success of a statistical background subtraction method relies on a significant mean overdensity around a given sample of primaries .",
    "this fact leaded us to consider bright galaxies , , since the neighborhood of fainter primaries do not show a significant density enhancement in sdss data .",
    "the uncertainty of the background decontamination procedure is dominated by poissonian statistics of subtraction of large numbers .",
    "a significant increase in the signal to noise ratio of satellites can be achieved by eliminating those galaxies with a low probability of association to the primaries . to this end , we restrict the parameter space of galaxies in the photometric catalogue so that we only use ranges of those parameters where the hypothesis assumed in the background subtraction method are best satisfied , and reliable estimations of luminosity , colour and projected radial distributions can be obtained .",
    "we impose constraints on apparent magnitude , colours and radial distance of photometric galaxies .",
    "accordingly , we adopted @xmath40 , @xmath24 , and a projected radial distance in the range @xmath41 kpc to @xmath42 , which we discuss in detail in what follows .",
    "the redshift range of primaries determines , along with the limiting magnitude of the photometric sample , the maximum luminosity that can be studied .",
    "given the limiting magnitude of @xmath43 in the r  band , and a minimum redshift for the primaries of @xmath16 , we chose the maximum luminosity @xmath44 in the r  band .",

    "it can be appreciated in this figure that a colour cut in includes most of faint companion objects , and has the advantage of removing high redshift galaxies reddened by k - correction .",
    "therefore , in all computations we exclude objects redder than this threshold to lower the noise due to the presence of high redshift galaxies . a clear indication that our colour cut is a suitable threshold to remove high redshift galaxies can be seen by inspection to fig .",

    "however , as can be appreciated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ f_dpandnoise ] , we notice that the projected density profile of red galaxies is not uniform in the inmost region around the luminous primary galaxies .",
    "this shows that the hypothesis of a uniform background fails within @xmath41 kpc for this data set .",
    "hence , in the computation of the statistical distributions , namely luminosity and colours , galaxies are restricted to be at a projected radial distance of at least @xmath41 kpc .",
    "this radial distance is consistent with previous findings that indicate the presence of an extended stellar halo associated to luminous galaxies .",

    "this problem is hard to address , and is part of proposed sdss  research challenges \" .",
    "the deblending process resulting from the current sdss - dr7 pipeline appears to induce an artificial neighbor excess , which strongly difficults the treatment of data on regions close to the primary ( see e.g. @xcite ) , specially in late - type galaxies where rich luminosity patterns are present on the disk .",
