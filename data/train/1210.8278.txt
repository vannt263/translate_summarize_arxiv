    "storage for quantum information is one of the essential parts of quantum computing and quantum communication @xcite , and the essential features of quantum memories have been demonstrated in different physical implementations @xcite . within these different implementations , the nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center in diamond has the particular appeal of room temperature operation@xcite and long coherence times @xcite .",
    "these properties make it a promising candidate for quantum information processing , an interface for quantum communication , and also as a nanoscale sensor for electric and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "while most of these applications rely on the electron spin of the nv center as the qubit , the center also contains nuclear spins , whose extended coherence times have advantages for applications such as quantum memories @xcite .",
    "such nuclear spin quantum memories can be integrated into quantum computing architectures that use nv centers in diamond @xcite .",
    "if nuclear spins are used as quantum memories , another relevant parameter is the coupling strength between the processing qubit ( the electron spin ) and the memory qubit ( the nuclear spin ) .",
    "the strength of this interaction determines the duration of the information transfer between the two qubits ; stronger couplings generally result in faster operation speed and therefore a lower loss of fidelity from decoherence .",
    "we can broadly distinguish between strongly coupled systems , where the coupling strengths @xmath2 are larger than the rabi frequencies @xmath3 , and weakly coupled systems , where @xmath4 . while earlier experiments have explored weakly coupled systems , it is the purpose of this paper to discuss a strongly coupled system .",
    "in addition to the advantage of short gate times , strongly coupled systems can provide simpler gate operations .",
    "as an example , the controlled - not ( cnot ) operation , which is the central part of the information transfer between the two qubits , can be implemented by a single control pulse in a strongly coupled system .",
    "figure  [ rabi ] ( a ) shows the strongly coupled quantum memory that we want to explore in the present study .",
    "it consists of a diamond nv center coupled to a @xmath0c nuclear spin in the nearest neighbor site .",
    "the hyperfine interaction between these spins is @xmath5 mhz @xcite , which is much larger than our typical rabi frequencies of @xmath6 mhz .    in this paper",
    ", we first discuss the system and introduce a purification scheme of the two - qubit system by a cycle of laser and microwave pulses , which significantly increases the purity of the initial state .",
    "we then demonstrate that the strong coupling also enhances the operation speed of the single - qubit operations on the nuclear spin by more than two orders of magnitude . on this basis",
    ", we explore the storage of quantum information in the memory qubit , determine the fidelity of the read - write process and protect the stored information against environmental noise by dynamical decoupling .",
    "we consider the quantum register of fig .",

    "the relevant hamiltonian is @xmath10 here , the @xmath11 are the electron spin operators , @xmath12 the nuclear spin operators , @xmath13 is the zero field splitting @xmath14 the strength of the zeeman interaction and @xmath15 and @xmath16 the secular and nonsecular parts of the hyperfine coupling .",
    "we label the eigenstates of this bipartite system as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the nuclear spin states .",
    "figure  [ rabi ] ( b ) shows the energy level scheme and the relevant transitions .",
    "since the hyperfine coupling @xmath15 is significantly stronger than the rabi frequency , pulses applied to the transitions mw@xmath21 , mw@xmath22 , and rf@xmath21 , are to an excellent approximation , selective for the targeted transitions . the resonance frequency for microwave and rf transitions",

    "the cw laser beam was sent through an acousto - optical modulator with an extinction ratio of 58 db and a rise time of 50 ns to generate the laser pulses for excitation and detection .",
    "the microwave pulses for the excitation of the electron spin were generated from two direct digital synthesis ( dds ) sources , passed through a switch with an isolation of 90 db and a 16 w amplifier .",
    "the radio - frequency pulses for driving the nuclear spin were generated with another dds source and passed through a switch and a 50 w amplifier .",
    "microwave and rf excitation pulses were combined with a power combiner and passed through a cu wire mounted on the surface of the diamond crystal . for these experiments , we aligned the field of a permanent magnet ( 65 g ) to the symmetry axis of the nv center , with the precision @xmath24 .",

    "the fitted cosine curve in the figure corresponds to a rabi frequency of 4.3 mhz . driving a bare @xmath0c nuclear spin at this rate",
    "would require an rf field strength of 428.5 mt , which is more than two orders of magnitude higher than the value of the experimentally applied field .",
    "this strong enhancement of the transition dipole moment is a consequence of the strong hyperfine coupling that does not commute with the electron spin hamiltonian . as a result , the eigenstates of the combined system are not the product states of the subsystems . while this mixing is small ( of the order of 0.03 ) , the transition dipole moment also receives a corresponding admixture of the electron spin dipole moment .",
    "these enhanced dipole moments have been used recently in the context of hybrid quantum registers @xcite . a similar case of spin - orbit qubits induced by a strong spin - orbit coupling",
    "was reported in rare - earth ions @xcite and other examples are known in nmr of magnetic materials @xcite .    according to the authors of ref .",

    "using @xmath36 mhz @xcite , we expect an enhancement factor of @xmath37 , and a numerical simulation of the nuclear spin rabi oscillation yields a value of 122 . from the data in the figure",
    ", we find that the duration of an rf @xmath28 pulse is @xmath37 ns .",
    "this pulse , which is selective with respect to the electron spin state , corresponds to a c@xmath38not@xmath39 operation required for transferring coherence between the electron and nuclear spin qubits .",
    "this gate duration is much shorter than the coherence time ( @xmath40 ) of the nv electron spin of @xmath41s .",

    "the usual initialization by a laser pulse leads to a large polarization of the electron spin , but to an almost complete depolarization of the nuclear spin .",
    "the population of the desired initial state is therefore only @xmath43 % . before the actual experiment",
    ", we therefore discuss a procedure to optimize the initialization ( i.e. a technique for purifying the two - qubit quantum state ) .",
    "several possible ways for polarizing the @xmath0c nuclear spins have been discussed before .",
    "one approach consists of applying a magnetic field that brings the excited state close to the level - anticrossing point @xcite .",
    "another approach is the single - shot readout experiment @xcite , but neither of these approaches is feasible under our experimental conditions .",
    "we therefore decided on another approach : we first initialized the electron spin , swaped the polarization to the nuclear spin and re - initialized the electron spin with a short laser pulse that is long enough to generate significant polarization of the electron spin , but short enough to retain most of the nuclear spin polarization @xcite .",

    "we now turn to the actual quantum storage experiment . for this purpose , we first prepared a coherent superposition state in the electron spin qubit , transferred this state to the nuclear spin qubit , let it evolve there , and read out the resulting state through the electron spin . the upper part of fig .",
    "[ transfer ] shows the pulse sequence used for this experiment . after the initialization sequence ,",
    "the first @xmath45 mw pulse generates the initial state @xmath62 for ideal pulses , this state could be transferred to the nuclear spin by a simple @xmath28 pulse on the rf@xmath21 transition .",
    "although this pulse is relatively short for a nuclear spin transition , it still leads to a finite loss of fidelity through relaxation during the transfer and due to the hyperfine interaction with the @xmath9n nuclear spin .",
    "we further reduced this loss by combining the transfer with a spin - echo sequence , as shown in fig .",
    "[ transfer ] .",
    "the timing of the rf @xmath28 pulse was adjusted to align its center with the echo maximum . in addition , the gap between the rf @xmath28 pulse and the following mw @xmath28 pulse was kept close to zero .",
    "those two steps are crucial for high - fidelity coherence transfer .    to quantify the storage fidelity , the four different initial states , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , corresponding to @xmath67 , and @xmath68 were initialized and stored .",
    "for each state , we measured the free evolution ( ramsey fringes ) of the @xmath0c nuclear spin .",
    "compared to the reference ramsey fringe curve in fig . 1 ( d )",
    ", all four curves show the same oscillation frequency and decoherence rates , but different starting phases .",
    "these starting phases are in accordance with the phases @xmath44 of the initial states prepared in the electron spin qubit within experimental uncertainty .",
    "this implies that the prepared coherence of the electron spin was successfully transferred to and stored in the nuclear spin . from the peak - to - peak amplitude ( @xmath69 ) of the ramsey fringes",
    ", we can determine the fidelity @xmath70.@xcite we determined the experimental values for @xmath69 by fitting a single oscillation in the shaded areas near 20 @xmath58s .",
    "for the four initial states @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath63 , and @xmath66 , we found fidelities of 0.90 , 0.83 , 0.86 , and 0.92 , respectively .",

    "[ transfer ] , the storage time of the nuclear spin qubit is @xmath72s .",
    "to further extend this storage time , we applied refocusing pulses to the nuclear spin .",
    "[ storage ] ( a ) shows the amplitude of the echoes generated with 1 ( blue dots ) , 2 ( green ) , and four ( purple ) refocusing pulses . in all cases",
    ", the coherence shows an exponential decay with a time constant of @xmath73 ms .",
    "the fact that the decay time does not depend on the number of refocusing pulses indicates that the environmental noise that causes the decay of the ramsey fringes is static on the timescale of these experiments .",
    "the red solid line compares these decays to the @xmath1 relaxation of the dark state ( @xmath26 ) , which is the state of the electron during these storage experiments . within experimental uncertainly , the decays are identical , which indicates that the decay is caused mostly be the relaxation of the electron spin .",
    "the observed lifetime of this quantum memory is significantly longer than the maximally observed lifetimes of the electron spin coherence in the nv center .",
    "using dynamical decoupling , the longest reported decoherence times were between 2.2 and 2.5 ms @xcite .",
    "these experimental results demonstrate that quantum mechanical superposition states can be stored for significantly longer times in the nuclear spin than in the electron spin .",
    "the observed decays appear to be limited by the longitudinal relaxation of the electron spin , rather than by irreversible dephasing of the nuclear spin .",
    "the observed decay times of the data shown in fig.[storage ] are 4.1 @xmath74 0.52 ms for the hahn echo , 3.7 @xmath74 0.31 ms and 3.5 @xmath74 0.35 ms for the cpmg-2 and cpmg-4 data .",
    "these values are very close to the value of @xmath75 3.3 @xmath74 0.2 ms , which was measured independently .",
    "we expect that the observed decay rate @xmath76 is the sum of two independent processes , the pure dephasing of the nuclear spin , with time constant @xmath77 and the population decay of the electron spin with time constant @xmath78 .",
    "since the observed decay time constants are slightly longer than @xmath78 , the pure dephasing time @xmath77 must be at least an order of magnitude longer than @xmath78 , @xmath79 ms .      in the experiment",
    "above , we prepared the coherence between the @xmath32 and @xmath31 states and applied the refocusing pulses to this transition .",
    "the limitation to the coherence lifetime comes from the relaxation of the electron spin : if the electron spin flips , the nuclear spin coherence is transferred to the @xmath81 transition , where it precesses with a much lower frequency and therefore rapidly looses the phase coherence . to avoid this decoherence mechanism ,",
    "we must also eliminate the dynamical phase acquired in the @xmath82 transition .",
    "this is possible , in principle , by applying dd pulses to this transition .",
    "however , the corresponding transition frequency is inconveniently low . a significantly more efficient way of dynamical decoupling is therefore to generate the refocusing pulses by using the rf@xmath21 transition together with the two microwave transitions .",
    "figure  [ scheme ] shows the corresponding pulse sequence .",
    "the pairs of @xmath28 pulses on the microwave transitions corresponds to an exchange of the two nuclear spin transitions .",
    "together with the rf@xmath21 pulse between them , they generate an effective inversion pulse for the rf@xmath22 coherence , which therefore refocuses over the total cycle time of duration @xmath83 .",
    "the coherence in the rf@xmath21 transition is refocused directly , with the first and third rf@xmath21 @xmath28 pulses .",
    "many tasks in quantum information processing and communication require the intermediate storage of information in some quantum memory device .",
    "good quantum memories should therefore excel in a number of aspects , such as long storage , high fidelity , but also fast read / write times . here , we investigated a room - temperature quantum memory consisting of a single @xmath0c nuclear spin in the first coordination shell of a nv center in diamond .",
    "this system profits from the strong hyperfine interaction ( @xmath84130 mhz ) in two ways : the read - write times are not limited by the strength of the coupling between the two qubits , but only by the available rabi frequencies . furthermore , the strong hyperfine coupling enhances the nuclear spin rabi frequency by more than two orders of magnitude , which also leads to a corresponding speed - up of the gate operations . in our implementation ,",
    "the read - write times are limited by the duration of the nuclear spin inversion pulse , which was 125 ns in our system .",
    "since this is only slightly shorter than the electron - spin dephasing time , we combined it with a hahn - echo sequence on the electron spin , which resulted in a transfer fidelity of 88 % and a total gate read - write time of 300 ns .",
    "the observed storage time of 3.3 ms appears to be limited by the @xmath1 relaxation of the electron spin . as we discussed in the text , an extended dynamical decoupling technique should be able to extend the memory time beyond this limit .",
    "in addition to the actual storage - preservation - recall experiments , we also developed a scheme for optimizing the polarization of the combined two - qubit system of the electron and nuclear spin , which consists of several cycles of laser- and microwave pulses .",
    "as discussed in the main text , we found that the population dynamics during laser irradiation can be well described by the rate equation model depicted in fig .",
    "[ initialization ] ( b ) .",
    "the corresponding equation of motion can be written as @xmath85 where the population vector @xmath86 and transition matrix @xmath87 are defined as , @xmath88      the initial conditions , immediately after the first swap operation , are @xmath90 . with this initial condition",
    ", one can easily find the solution for the two populations @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "for the remaining populations , we used the ansatz as @xmath93 to find the solutions @xmath94 we also determined the three parameters , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 as a function of the laser intensity .",
    "figure  [ laser_power ] shows the resulting rates in the upper part and the effect of the intensity on the initialization fidelity in the lower part .",
