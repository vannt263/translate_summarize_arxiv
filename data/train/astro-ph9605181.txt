    "the correction for reddening is a crucial step when using sne  ia as distance indicators . to estimate the amount of reddening @xmath3 , suffered by a given sn  ia , two different approaches have been adopted so far .",
    "one may infer the reddening through the use of a relation between the intensity of the interstellar absorption lines and the total @xmath3   as suggested by barbon et al .",
    "since this technique applies to sn spectra having sufficient resolution and good signal to noise ratio , it has been used only for a limited number of sne ( e.g. patat et al . 1996 ) .",
    "alternatively , the extinction may be estimated from the observed sn color if one assumes that all sn  ia at a given phase , for instance at maximum light , have the same intrinsic @xmath4 color . in this case",
    "the problem becomes the determination of the intrinsic sn  ia color at maximum .",
    "the most common approach is to adopt as reference the color of the bluest objects in a given sample of sn  ia , assuming that they are those less affected by reddening .",
    "however this approach is seriously endangered by possible photometric errors .",
    "this may explain the quite different intrinsic @xmath4 values which have been derived in the past , e.g. : 0.20 ( pskovskii @xcite ) , 0.15 ( barbon et al .",
    "@xcite ) , 0.27 ( cadonau et al .",
    "@xcite ) , 0.25 ( van den bergh & pazder @xcite ) , 0.16 ( della valle & panagia @xcite ) , 0.15 ( branch & tammann @xcite ) , + 0.03 ( branch & miller @xcite ) and + 0.09 ( sandage & tammann @xcite ) .",
    "as it can be seen , @xmath4 ranges about 0.35 mag with recent estimates being , on the average , redder .",
    "it is worth noting that since @xmath5 @xmath3and @xmath64.0 ( savage & mathis @xcite ) , even small errors in the adopted @xmath4 reference color have strong impact on the derived absolute magnitude @xmath7 .",
    "since sn events are rare , one is often forced to use data which , admittedly , are of poor photometric quality in order to build a statistical significant sample . if some observations are affected by systematic errors , these may severely bias the estimate of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , several authors ( sandage & tammann @xcite , branch & miller @xcite , vaughan et al .",
    "@xcite , schaefer @xcite ) have noticed that most of the bluest sn  ia have been observed photographically at the asiago astrophysical observatory in the seventies and they raised the possibility that these observations were affected by systematic errors . since for most of these `` blue '' sne",
    "the only available photometry is that collected at asiago and bearing in mind the importance of snia in the determination of the extragalactic distance scale , it appears of great interest to check the accuracy of these old measurements .",
    "the intensive program of photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of sne started at the asiago astrophysical observatory in the early 60 s . before the introduction , in the mid eighties , of ccd s",
    "the photometry of sne was obtained by photographic observations mainly using the 67/92  cm schmidt telescope and the 122 cm reflector .",
    "the sn magnitudes were estimated by comparison with local sequences which , in turn , were calibrated by means of photographic transfers from standard fields , usually photoelectrically observed selected areas . to calibrate the local sequences ,",
    "the photographic plates were measured with a becker iris photometer , whereas sn magnitudes , especially for objects lying on the luminous background of their parent galaxies , were often obtained by eye comparison with the local sequences .",
    "prompted by the aforementioned criticism , we decided to verify the old asiago photometry by re  calibrating the local comparison sequences used to derive the sn magnitudes .",
    "the comparison of the new measurements with those reported in the original papers will provide us a quantitative estimate of the reliability of the old sn data and , in turn , will allow us to correct the light curves . we note that many sequences were already re - calibrated by tsvetkov at the crimean observatory ( for the individual references see table 1 and 2 ) who , however , used a photographic technique similar to that adopted at asiago for the majority of stars , namely those fainter than b=14.5 mag .    to calibrate a significant sample of the local sequences , several nights of good photometric quality",
    "are needed , which it is not presently the case at asiago due to the increasing light pollution and deteriorating sky conditions .",
    "therefore , among the sne studied at asiago , we selected those accessible from eso  la silla ( @xmath8 ) which resulted in a sample of 16 sne covering about 25 years of observations and requiring the re - calibration of about a hundred stars of the local comparison sequences .",
    "these are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : sample ] whereas table 2 reports the sne observed at asiago not included in the present sample but with standard sequences re  calibrated by tsvetkov .",

    "the latter case is not surprising since in the original paper ( ciatti & rosino 1978 ) it was stated that the sequence of sn  1976j was calibrated by only one photographic transfer and therefore the results `` must be considered very preliminary '' .",

    "as it can be seen , the dispersion of the asiago photometry increases as the sequence stars become fainter and it might also be present a slight dependence on magnitude , mainly induced by the sequences measured in the seventies which were , in the average , fainter and therefore more affected by random errors .    in the literature ( e.g. sandage & tammann @xcite ) it has been raised the doubt that some of the asiago photometry was obtained without the proper plate - filter combination .",

    "we have seen that , for each sequence , there is a significant dispersion around the zero point offset ( col.3 of tab .",
    "4 ) , that is the magnitude corrections were different even for stars of the same sequence . since the sn magnitudes , at each phase",
    ", have been obtained by interpolation between the couple of comparison stars close in brightness to the sn , the correction of the magnitudes and colors of the sn is not simply a zero point correction .    in principle",

    "however our experience show that : a ) the internal errors originally made in the comparison were small ( @xmath93 mag ) compared to the errors of the calibration of the sequence ; b ) there is an intrinsic limit for the photometric accuracy which can be achieved using photographic plates , in particular those obtained with our schmidt telescope ( @xmath94 mag ) ; c ) the procedure is time consuming implying the digitizing of hundreds of plates .    for these reasons we decided to correct the sn photometry adopting the original estimates of the sn magnitudes relative to the comparison stars , that is ,",

    "the first case is that of sn  1970j which , on the basis of the original photometry was estimated @xmath110 mag and @xmath111 mag brighter in the b and v , respectively , and this resulted in a @xmath112 mag too blue .",

    "this is not surprising since they used the same local sequence and it demonstrates that at least the asiago estimates of the sn with respect to the sequence were correct .",
    "it is worth to note that at late phases , the re - calibrated b light curve appears @xmath1130.6 mag brighter than the template .",
    "this effect , which is found in many other photographic light curves , is probably due to errors related to the poor contrast of the sn against the parent galaxy background ( cfr .",
    "boisseau & wheeler @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the comparison sequence of sn  1970j was used also to estimate the magnitudes of sn  1972j which , in turn , resulted affected by the same errors .    also sn  1975o had a @xmath114 color @xmath1130.3 mag too blue in the original photometry compared with the re - calibrated value . in this case , the difference is not due to a systematic calibration error of the sequence , but to random errors in the v magnitude of stars @xmath23 and @xmath115 which conspired to give different extrapolated maxima .",
    "we can also re - calibrate the sne which sequences have been re - measured by tsvetkov , using the same procedure described above . sn  1972h turns out to be @xmath1130.4 mag redder in proximity of maximum light .",
    "the fit to the templates was quite uncertain , due to the fact that the first observation has been obtained two weeks after maximum .",
    "the color drift is due to the revised v magnitudes of stars @xmath116 and @xmath23 .",
    "small variations are seen in the early observations of sn  1973n , but around two months after maximum , when the sn was close to the plate limit ( @xmath117 ) , the b magnitudes were too faint by @xmath118 mag and the vs were too bright by the same amount .",
    "the new fittings give a @xmath119 bluer by 0.4 mag with respect to previous estimates .",

    "it should be stressed that a much larger error would result if , as sometimes done in the past , the calibration is based only on the bluest objects of the sample . in this case",
    "the result would be dominated by photometric errors .",
    "the above considerations are valid in the hypothesis that sn  ia have intrinsically the same absolute magnitude and color at maximum . for many years this assumption was made on the basis of both observational and theoretical evidence .",

    ". 1992b , leibundgut et al .",
    "1993 , turatto et al .",
    "if these sne are eliminated from the sample , the dispersion of the sn absolute magnitude distribution strongly decreases but the residual dispersion is not entirely due to photometric errors or different reddening .",
    "the two recent sne 1992a and 1994d for which accurate photometry is available , shows definite intrinsic differences ( patat et al .",
    "we also note that recently hflich & khokhlov ( 1995 ) have suggested , on the basis of theoretical modeling , the existence of a relation between @xmath7 and @xmath154 which mimics the reddening law ( van den bergh @xcite ) .",

    "from the dispersion of the points of the hamuy et al.s sn sample in the @xmath7 vs @xmath154 diagram ( which includes the photometric errors ) , it can be estimated that the distance of a snia with accurate photometry can be derived with a relative error of only 5% .",
    "in this paper we have presented and discussed new ccd observations of several sequences of comparison stars used to calibrate the photographic photometry of sne observed in the past at the asiago observatory . with these data ,",
    "we have re - calibrated the light and color curves of a sample of sn  ia .",
    "this work was motivated by the claims of several authors ( e.g. sandage & tammann @xcite , branch & miller @xcite , vaughan et al .",
    "( @xcite ) ) that systematic errors affected the photometry of some sn  ia observed at asiago in the seventies .",

    "tables 4 and 5 ) .",
    "these errors ( @xmath217 mag ) were due to the observing technique employed and which was based on photographic transfers .",
    "we have however no explanation for the large errors found for the sequence used to calibrate sne 1970j and 1972j , whereas the sequence of sn  1976j , the other object with a large correction , was reported as preliminary just in the original paper .    with the new sequences we have derived new light curves and @xmath34 sn photometry is available upon request . ] for the sne determining new @xmath11 magnitude and @xmath0 color at maximum ( see tab .",

    "only one case , i.e. sn 1974j , of very blue supernova still remains which , as we said earlier , should need further investigation .    finally , we stress that , as far as the use of sn  ia as distance indicators is concerned , the best approach is to calibrate the relation between @xmath7 and @xmath154 using all `` bona fide '' sn  ia . by using this approach , we can not determine the intrinsic absolute magnitude and color of the individual objects , but we eliminate the problem of dealing with the unknown reddening in the parent galaxy and strongly reduce the influence of random photometric errors .",
