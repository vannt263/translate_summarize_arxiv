    "this picture is not satisfying because the higgs gets one - loop quadratically divergent corrections to its squared mass .",
    "the most significant corrections come from loops of top quarks , @xmath2-bosons and the higgs ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the top loop is the most severe - demanding a contribution to the higgs mass of 200 gev or less requires a momentum cutoff @xmath3 gev .",

    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model s most compelling feature is its suggestive unification of couplings .",
    "its least compelling feature is the fact that it has over 100 new parameters and yet the current bound on the higgs mass requires fine - tuning of parameters for successful electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "models that improve this situation exist , and thus weakly coupled superpartners at the weak scale remains an interesting option .",
    "however , as we close in on the parameter space of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , it is of great interest to find alternative weakly coupled theories of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "a new class of models , called `` little higgs '' theories [ 3 - 8 ] , produce a light higgs boson with weakly coupled physics up to 10s of tev . as in composite higgs models @xcite , the higgs is a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson ( pngb ) and is massless at tree - level .",
    "its mass is protected by a global symmetry which is spontaneously broken .",
    "the symmetry is explicitly broken by weakly coupled operators in the theory which become the normal sm couplings below 1 tev .",
    "the little higgs trick is that no one operator alone explicitly breaks the global symmetry protecting the higgs mass , and therefore no quadratically divergent contribution exists at one loop .",

    "automatically protects the higgs mass at one loop .",
    "the key is that by having both triplets get vevs , both produce a set of ngbs ( including doublets ) , either of which could have been eaten by the massive gauge fields .",
    "it is the fact that no one operator in the tree - level lagrangian contains both triplets which protects the doublet mass .",
    "the symmetry protecting the higgs mass in this model is an approximate @xmath8 ^ 2 $ ] .",

    "the result is a two higgs doublet model with heavy @xmath10 gauge bosons and new scalars at a tev .    in section 4",
    "we discuss the spectrum of the @xmath11 model and indicate some of the phenomenological constraints [ 10 - 14 ] . because our model has no more gauge couplings than the sm , all couplings and masses in the gauge sector are a function of the breaking scale @xmath12 and measured gauge couplings",
    ". we also comment on flavor issues in these models .    in the last section",
    "we discuss possibilities for future directions .",
    "in this section we describe a very simple extension of the sm which keeps the higgs naturally light by employing the little higgs mechanism .",
    "the model contains new particles and couplings which cancel the quadratic divergences from the top quark loop and from the sm gauge interactions .",
    "this is accomplished by enlarging the @xmath7 weak gauge interactions to @xmath13 .",
    "the cancellation of the divergences from the higgs self - coupling is more difficult and is described in section 4 .",
    "our mechanism for eliminating the one - loop divergence from gauge interactions ( figure 1.b ) can be understood as follows : an @xmath13 gauge group is spontaneously broken near 1 tev by a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of two @xmath13 triplet scalars .",
    "the triplet expectation values are aligned so that both vevs leave the same @xmath7 unbroken . ignoring their coupling trough the gauge interactions",
    "each scalar breaks a global @xmath14 , each yielding 5 nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngbs ) . with the @xmath13 gauge interactions turned on ,",
    "the diagonal linear combination of ngbs is eaten , but the orthogonal linear combination remains massless at tree level .",
    "the masslessness of these modes is easily understood by noticing that in absence of a direct coupling between the two scalar triplets each of them `` thinks '' that it is the only field which breaks the gauge group and therefore contains exact ngbs .",
    "quantum corrections from loops involving the gauge bosons generate couplings between the two triplets and therefore a mass for the pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ( pngb ) . however , there is no quadratically divergent one - loop diagram involving both scalar triplets .",
    "finite and log - divergent diagrams contribute small scalar masses of order @xmath15 gev .",
    "more concretely , consider an @xmath13 gauge theory with two scalar fields transforming as ( complex ) triplets @xmath16 of the gauge group with a potential 2 ( * * _ 1^_1 -f^2)^2  +  2 ( * * _ 2^_2 -f^2)^2 [ eq : phipot ] which generates vevs for the @xmath17s .",
    "for simplicity , we assume equal couplings and vevs for both triplets .",
    "this defines a linear sigma model with two global @xmath13 symmetries acting on the two triplets . the spontaneous breaking @xmath18 ^ 2 \\rightarrow [ su(2)]^2 $ ] yields five ngbs from each scalar .",
    "we now weakly gauge an @xmath13 such that both scalars are triplets under the gauge symmetry .",
    "this explicitly breaks the @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] global symmetry to diagonal @xmath13 . after spontaneous symmetry breaking the five `` diagonal '' ngbs",
    "are eaten by the higgs mechanism and the five orthogonal linear combinations are pngbs . the symmetry which they correspond to  `` axial '' @xmath13  is explicitly broken by the gauge couplings .",
    "but since the tree level scalar potential respects both @xmath13 s the pngbs remain massless at tree level .",
    "we parametrize the scalars as _ 1 = e^i _ 1/f (    c 0 + 0 + f+_1    ) = e^i _ eaten / f  e^i /f (    c 0 + 0 + f+_1    ) + * * _ 2=e^i _ 2/f (    c 0 + 0 + f+_2    ) = e^i _ eaten/ f e^-i /f (    c 0 + 0 + f+_2    ) where the first parametrization is the most obvious , but the second is more convenient because it separates the eaten modes @xmath19 from the pngbs @xmath20 .",
    "note that @xmath19 shifts under diagonal ( vector ) @xmath13 transformations whereas @xmath20 shifts under `` axial '' @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath21 are radial modes which obtain masses @xmath22 from the potential .",
    "since we are interested in the physics of the pngbs we will suppress the eaten fields @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore we will take the limit @xmath23 in which the radial modes decouple and our linear sigma model turns into the corresponding non - linear sigma model . the non - linear sigma model obtained by integrating out the @xmath21 includes non - renormalizable interactions which become strongly coupled at @xmath24 ; at this scale the non - linear sigma model description breaks down . for most of this paper we will use the non - linear sigma model description because it is more general .",
    "it focuses on the physics of the pngbs .",
    "details of the uv theory which lead to the @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] symmetry breaking are encoded in higher dimensional operators and decouple from the relevant physics .",
    "the non - linear sigma model field are then parameterized as @xcite _",

    "this is convenient because diagrams involving the trilinear gauge couplings can not contribute to the scalar potential ( no derivatives ) in this gauge .",
    "thus the second diagram vanishes .",
    "diagrams contributing to the scalar potential are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the first diagram is quadratically divergent , the second one is log - divergent , and diagrams with even more @xmath17 insertions would be finite .",

    "the top quark loop which we discuss in the next section generates a negative mass - squared and thereby triggers electroweak symmetry breaking .",

    "but in this theory @xmath20 would be eaten by the higgs mechanism , thus it can not have any non - derivative couplings in the lagrangian .",
    "therefore , only diagrams which involve both @xmath40 s ( figure 3.b ) can contribute to the higgs mass but they necessarily involve more internal propagators and are not quadratically divergent .      we now show that it is straightforward to add fermions and a top yukawa coupling which does not upset the radiative stability of the higgs mass .",
    "this can be done for both the linear and non - linear sigma models but we will only present the analysis of the non - linear model .    since @xmath7-weak is embedded into an @xmath13 gauge group , the top - bottom @xmath7-doublet is enlarged to a triplet @xmath41 .",

    "the @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] symmetry not only protects both sets of ngbs ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) from obtaining a mass , it also forbids any non - derivative couplings of the ngbs .",
    "therefore , in order to generate gauge- and yukawa couplings for the higgs , these symmetries must be explicitly broken . the trick is to do this breaking `` non - locally in theory space '' @xcite or `` collectively '' . by collective breaking",
    "we mean that no single coupling in the lagrangian breaks the symmetry by itself . always at least two couplings are required to break any of the two @xmath13 s .    to see this explicitly ,",

    "of course , gauge invariance requires them to have the same value , but as spurions they break different symmetries , and it is useful to keep track of them independently .",
    "the key is to note that if either of the two couplings @xmath55 and @xmath56 is set to zero the lagrangian has an exact @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] symmetry , and therefore two sets of exact ngbs ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) result from the spontaneous symmetry breaking . only with both @xmath57 s non - vanishing are the symmetries explicitly broken to the diagonal gauged @xmath13 . for @xmath58",

    "thus when either of the @xmath60 is set to zero @xmath20 is an exact ngb .",
    "any loop correction to its mass must be proportional to both @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "but , there are no quadratically divergent one loop diagrams involving both @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",

    "thus any @xmath20 mass which is generated from yukawa loops must be proportional to both @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , it must be proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "this follows from the two spurious @xmath66 symmetries under which only @xmath44 and @xmath43 are charged such that @xmath67 are neutral . any operator which is generated by loops must also respect these spurious symmetries , and if it does nt contain @xmath42s it can only depend on the invariant combinations @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",

    "this is because @xmath70 commutes with all the spurious global @xmath13 symmetries which we used to argue for the absence of divergences .",
    "thus these arguments go through unchanged .",
    "_ ii . yukawa couplings for light fermions : _ since the yukawa couplings of the other fermions are small , no care needs to be taken in their coupling to the higgs in order to avoid large higgs mass corrections .",

    "we postpone a more detailed discussion of flavor until section 4 .",
    "higgs quartic coupling : _ one possibility for the quartic coupling is to ignore the numerically not very significant one - loop divergence from the higgs loop and add a quartic coupling without canceling its divergence .",
    "a more satisfying model in which this divergence is also canceled requires more work .",

    "the only non - trivial gauge invariant contraction at our disposal is @xmath76 .",

    "1^_2 = f^2 + i f - h^h -12 ^2 + + 16 f^2 ( h^h)^2 + [ eq : phi1phi2 ] and it s hermitian conjugate .",
    "focusing on the @xmath28-dependence , we see that the quartic coupling always comes accompanied by a mass term when expanding out a term like @xmath79 . setting the coefficient of the quartic to one ,",
    "the mass is of order @xmath12 which is much too large .",
    "note that if the constant term in the expansion of @xmath76 were not there , one could generate a quartic by simply squaring eq .",
    "( [ eq : phi1phi2 ] )",
    ". this observation will be the key to constructing a quartic in section 4 .",
    "of course , it is possible to fine tune the mass term away .",
    "for example the potential @xmath80 does not contain a mass term .",
    "but this is no better than the tuning of the higgs mass in the standard model as the relative size of coefficients in @xmath80 is not stable under quantum corrections .",
    "now we present a complete model of electroweak symmetry breaking with no fine - tuning required to separate the higgs mass from the cutoff .",
    "the main distinction from the previous model is the extension of the gauge group ( and therefore the approximate global symmetries ) from @xmath13 to @xmath11 .",
    "the expansion of the group allows one to use a new mechanism to generate a quartic coupling .",
    "take @xmath40 and @xmath81 as fields in the non - linear sigma model @xmath9 ^ 2 $ ] with the diagonal @xmath11 gauged .",
    "the important distinction from the previous model is that the @xmath11-breaking is _ not _ aligned ,    = e^i /f (    l 0 + 0 + f + 0    ) + = e^i /f (    l 0 + 0 + 0 + f    ) and only the gauged @xmath7 is linearly realized .",
    "note that the product @xmath82 contains no constant term !",
    "this is exactly the success we were attempting to achieve in the @xmath13 model .",
