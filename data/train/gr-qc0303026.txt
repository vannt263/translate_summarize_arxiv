    "in recent years , spin foam models have been established as possible candidates for a quantum theory of gravity ( for recent reviews see @xcite ) .",
    "they are commonly viewed as covariant ( path integral ) versions of a canonical quantization and in fact share some features of quantum geometry ( in the case of 2 + 1 a precise relation can be established @xcite ) . as a discretized path integral they can be derived from plebanski s action @xcite which is a formulation of general relativity as a constrained @xmath0-theory @xcite .",
    "being path integrals of a gauge theory , they have to deal with the anomaly issue : the path integral measure has to be invariant under transformations generated by the constraints .",
    "sometimes it is claimed that a covariant quantization avoids the issue of anomalies which plagued canonical approaches for a long time ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is well known that there is also an anomaly problem in path integral quantizations which in spin foam quantizations has just been ignored in most of the existing literature ( see , however , @xcite for a recent paper which discusses this issue independently in the example of 3-dimensional @xmath0-theory ) . a complete analysis would require an understanding of the continuum limit which has not yet been developed sufficiently . still , we will see that it is possible to shed light on the problem and to derive conditions for the amplitudes involved in the definition of a spin foam model .",
    "to that end we look at the problem from two perspectives .",
    "first , we view the discretized version , which is obtained by fixing a space - time triangulation , as a regularization of the path integral , in particular its measure , which would result in the continuum limit .",
    "second , we analyze the restrictions on the spin foam measure imposed by background independence directly at the discrete level .    to explain the part of the anomaly problem studied here we first recall the situation of standard path integrals : there is a prescription which results in a unique measure ( up to a constant factor ) which is at least formally invariant .",
    "this is usually the obvious measure which integrates over all canonical coordinates with constant weight function . after removing the regulator",
    "the measure might not be invariant giving rise to quantum anomalies . in any case ,",
    "it is necessary to use the invariant measure for the regularized version ; otherwise the gauge symmetries are broken explicitly and the results are unphysical . since the formally invariant measure is obvious in most cases , the standard term ` anomaly ' only refers to the second issue , namely whether or not the measure will remain invariant after removing the regulator .    in the case of spin foam models ,",
    "the situation is more involved .",
    "first , the constraint algebra is mixed and not closed which will be seen to lead to an additional function in the measure which has not been taken into account previously .",
    "secondly , the space - time discretization obscures the role of the measure and the meaning of invariance in this context .",
    "therefore , even analyzing the formal invariance of a measure requires new techniques which will be provided in the present paper .",
    "the usual anomaly problem , which analyzes the invariance after the regulator is removed , will not be touched here since the continuum limit is not understood .",
    "we will , however , see that already a formally invariant measure , which is a necessary prerequisite for an anomaly - free continuum measure , puts strong restrictions on amplitudes in the spin foam model .",
    "our definition of a formally invariant _ discrete _ measure , i.e. , amplitudes associated with lower dimensional simplices , is that it must descend from the formally invariant continuum measure along the lines of the spin foam discretization .",
    "this does not imply that the continuum formulation is seen as fundamental such that the discretization is introduced only for , e.g. , computational purposes .",
    "rather , we view the discrete theory as basic and use the continuum formulation as a tool to derive conditions since it must at least be approximated in certain , semiclassical regimes .",
    "this viewpoint concerning the lower dimensional amplitudes and the continuum measure is the same one as usually assumed for the relation between the vertex amplitude and the continuum action .",
    "provided the required calculations are feasible , this will also fix the formally invariant measure uniquely up to a constant factor , which translates in conditions for the spin foam amplitudes .    an immediate question in the context of anomalies",
    "is whether or not a spin foam state sum can be finite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to devise methods for checking a spin foam quantization for formal anomalies , thus obtaining conditions for the lower dimensional amplitudes .",
    "while there is general agreement on the vertex ( @xmath1-simplex ) amplitude , which can be viewed as representing the exponentiated action , there are no clear - cut arguments as to which lower dimensional simplex amplitudes should be used ; in the literature , it is largely regarded as being open to choice , maybe constrained by semi - classical issues .",
    "this problem is particularly pressing because the question of whether or not a model is finite hinges on the asymptotic behavior of these amplitudes .",
    "note that our criterion is formulated from the perspective that the fundamental theory is intrinsically discrete .",
    "no matter how the approach to a continuum description is performed via a limit or as a coarse - grained approximation gauge degrees of freedom have to be removed which is only possible with an invariant measure .",
    "it is sometimes argued that finiteness arises because ultraviolet or infrared divergences are regularized by quantum gravitational effects like a minimal length scale ( this does in fact occur in canonical quantizations @xcite ) . from our point of view",
    ", however , this is not tenable since the anomaly issue is completely unrelated to ultraviolet or infrared divergences .    as a consequence of an invariant measure",
    ", a standard path integral quantization can not lead to finite results without gauge fixing if gauge orbits do not have finite volume ( which is to be expected for gravity ; to avoid confusion we emphasize here that we are mainly concerned with the diffeomorphism constraints , not with an @xmath2 or @xmath3 gauss constraint ) . a simple model where this can be illustrated is @xmath4 dimensional @xmath0-theory .",
    "this theory is equivalent to @xmath4 dimensional gravity for non - degenerate triads and thus has the same gauge orbit structure at least on the constraint surface .",
    "it turns out , and is commonly accepted , that the spin foam amplitude for @xmath4 dimensional @xmath0-theory is infinite in accordance with the expectation from path integrals .",
    "the discrete symmetries of the simplicial action can be explicitly analyzed @xcite and directly linked with the triangulation independence of the spin foam model .",
    "an interesting case is @xmath4 gravity with cosmological constant @xmath5 . in this case",
    "the action can be written as that of a @xmath6 chern - simons theory whose level @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a path integral quantization of this theory leads to the turaev - viro model defined in terms of a quantum group @xmath9 for @xmath10 a root of unity related to the cosmological constant by @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "transition amplitudes turn out to be finite .",
    "although this is often interpreted as a consequence of the infrared cut - off introduced by the quantum deformation , from our viewpoint this is a consequence of the compactness of the gauge group @xmath6 .",
    "it is not clear however how to generalize this intuition to four dimensions .",
    "the gauge properties of @xmath0-theory in four dimensions are very similar to its @xmath12-dimensional relative .",
    "in particular , divergences in the path integral @xcite can also be traced back to infinite volume factors coming from the topological gauge symmetry . if we concentrate on the spin foam models for four dimensional gravity that are obtained from an implementation of constraints on the @xmath0 amplitudes ( such as reisenberger@xcite or the barrett  crane models",
    "@xcite ) the topological gauge symmetry is manifestly broken by the implementation of the constraints . as a result , it was debated whether the remnant gauge symmetries would produce diverging spin foam amplitudes or rather contain `` finite volume '' gauge orbits . here we show that minimal requirements of background independence imply the existence of divergences and rule out the finite normalizations proposed in the literature @xcite .    in the following section",
    ", we will introduce a finite dimensional toy model which illustrates the steps of a spin foam quantization mimicking @xmath0-theory with additional constraints . in section  [ measure ]",
    "we discuss the definition of the ( formal ) path integral for constrained systems . in section  [ bf ]",
    "we revisit the spin foam quantization of @xmath0-theory in three dimensions to introduce notation and review the gauge analysis of the discrete theory performed in @xcite . in section  [ gr ]",
    "we discuss the definition of the correct path integral measure for 4-dimensional spin foam models defined as constrained bf state sums .",
    "we look at the problem from the passive and active diffeomorphism perspectives . in the first case ,",
    "we reformulate @xmath0-theory in a way which makes the relation between the path integral measure and the face amplitude obvious .",
    "this provides us with a recipe for computing the large spin behavior of amplitudes in spin foams for gravity discussed in subsection  [ gre ] . in subsection  [ dc ]",
    "we discuss the restrictions imposed on the form of the measure by background independence in the active picture . in the case of the barrett - crane model , we show that various normalizations proposed in the literature do not satisfy these requirements and should be regarded as anomalous .",
    "this includes the finite normalization introduced in @xcite . in subsection",
    "[ te ] we define a simple model satisfying those background independence requirements .",
    "the latter can be thought of as the spin foam quantization of the husain  kucha model .",
    "to illustrate the importance of choosing the correct measure in spin foam models we first discuss a simple toy model with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "it incorporates the essential steps of a spin foam quantization of plebanski s action for gravity , which are a field discretization and the solution of a constraint for lagrange multipliers .",
    "being a system with a finite number of degrees of freedom , the continuum limit can not be modeled .",
    "however , as discussed before , the anomaly issue already requires the correct treatment of the regularization before the continuum limit is taken , which will be illustrated here .",
    "the action of the model is given by @xmath13 which has two constrained degrees of freedom there is only one constraint for two degrees of freedom .",
    "the remaining constraint requires @xmath14 to be zero , but otherwise @xmath15 is free .",
    "since the usual kinetic term is missing , the dynamics then requires @xmath16 to be constant , which we will also see later in the path integral quantization . ]",
    "@xmath17 , which we assume to live on a circle , with conjugate momenta @xmath18 and three lagrange multipliers @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 . compared with @xmath0-theory , @xmath22 represents the components of the field @xmath23 which contains both physical degrees of freedom and lagrange multipliers .",
    "if we set @xmath24 resulting in the action @xmath25 the theory is constrained completely , i.e. , both @xmath16 and @xmath26 must be zero .",
    "there are no degrees of freedom in this case . with unrestricted @xmath21 ,",
    "however , the two original lagrange multipliers are constrained which restores one degree of freedom : @xmath19 has to equal @xmath20 and thus only @xmath14 has to be zero whereas the difference is free , which can easily be seen by solving the @xmath21-constraint explicitly : @xmath27 this feature mimics the transition from @xmath0-theory to gravity where also additional constraints ( the simplicity constraints ) reduce the freedom of original lagrange multipliers of @xmath0-theory and thereby introduce local degrees of freedom .",
    "a spin foam quantization proceeds by quantizing the simple theory whose discretized state sum can be computed explicitly and incorporating the additional constraints at the state sum level .",
    "the simple theory ( the analog of @xmath0-theory ) here is @xmath28 with path integral @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "the result is certainly infinite since we are dealing with an unfixed gauge theory . in this case",
    "a gauge fixing is simple , but we do not do this because we want to understand the role of a field discretization and the multiplier constraints in this respect .    the path integral for @xmath31 , the analog of gravity , in this case can also be obtained explicitly : @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "computing the remaining integrations we obtain @xmath35 here , @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the initial and the final value of @xmath16 which are constrained to be equal but free otherwise .",
    "due to the fact that we have only one remaining gauge symmetry after incorporating the @xmath21-constraint , we only have one infinite integral left rather than two in ( [ z0 ] ) .    in finite spin foam models",
    "one solves the multiplier constraint @xmath38 at the discretized level and , in some cases , obtains a finite result even _ without _ fixing the remaining gauge freedom @xcite .",
    "a spin foam quantization , however , also involves a discretization of space - time which , as already mentioned , is not realized in this finite dimensional model . still , it is worth checking what effects a field discretization itself can have ; effects of the space - time discretization will be discussed later . therefore , we now discretize @xmath19 and @xmath20 which are analogous to @xmath23-field components ( we could also discretize the remaining components @xmath39 and @xmath40 , without changing our results ) . in analogy to a spin foam quantization",
    "we do this by writing the integral representation of the delta function @xmath41 as a sum @xmath42 .",
    "the path integral ( [ z0 ] ) ( absorbing constant factors in the measure ) then becomes @xmath43 where the summation index @xmath44 indicates that @xmath45 is not a single number but a function of time , and we are summing over the values at fixed times individually ( i.e. , this is a discrete analog of the path integral ) .    at the discrete level the @xmath21-constraint implies @xmath46 and we must only sum over those pairs of integers fulfilling this condition in order to obtain a quantization for @xmath31 ( analogously to summing only over simple representations in a spin foam quantization ) : @xmath47",
    "this is the analog of ( [ z ] ) and its value is , of course , the same as in the calculation with continuous @xmath19 . in particular",
    ", it is infinite .",
    "as anticipated , the field discretization and the spin foam like quantization could not take care of the gauge orbit divergence .",
    "the divergent integral of ( [ z ] ) has just been replaced by a divergent sum in ( [ zdisc ] ) .      in spin",
    "foam quantizations the issue of convergence hinges on the choice of lower dimensional simplex amplitudes , which can be considered as functions of some components of the discretized @xmath23-field . in our model , however , we do not have any free function available since the path integral result is unique . to include such a function we write our result in the spin foam form",
    "( there is still a @xmath48-integral because we chose not to discretize @xmath48 ) @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the vertex amplitude ( analogous to the integration over connections of the discretized @xmath51 ) . a model of lower dimensional amplitudes",
    "can now be included by simply inserting a new function @xmath52 into @xmath53 ( more generally , @xmath54 could also depend on @xmath48 ) : @xmath55 our derivation shows that the face amplitude @xmath52 is fixed and constant , but let us see what a different function would imply . for illustrative purposes ,",
    "we choose @xmath56 which is finite for all integer @xmath57 .",
    "now it is easy to see that @xmath58 _ is _ finite , where we have the effective potential @xmath59 ( we used the fourier series @xmath60 for @xmath61 and extended with @xmath62-periodicity . ) in fact , this is an ordinary path integral for a system of two degrees of freedom in an effective potential @xmath63 _ without _ constraints .",
    "we now have to decide if this finite result makes sense and can tell us anything about the original system .",
    "the answer is clearly _ negative _ : the role of the effective potential is completely unclear , and it has nothing to do with the original system .",
    "originally , @xmath16 and @xmath64 have to equal each other but are free otherwise , whereas in the modified system they are independent but subject to motion in a potential .",
    "furthermore , the kind of modification , e.g.  the form of the potential , depends on the face amplitude which has no distinguished form other than @xmath65 which follows from the invariant measure . in conclusion , a finite path integral for an unfixed system with constraints can not be trusted .",
    "( it can not even be regarded as an approximation since the measure is not just a smeared version of a @xmath66-function with support on the constraint surface .",
    "the effective potential is singular on a submanifold of the configuration space , but this does not happen at the constraint surface @xmath67 , but at @xmath68 . ) in fact , introducing a non - constant amplitude is nothing but introducing an arbitrary function @xmath69 into the path integral which _ breaks the invariance of the measure_. ( note that @xmath19 serves as a lagrange multiplier and thus its conjugate momentum @xmath70 is implicitly constrained to be zero . the gauge freedom generated by this constraint",
    "is broken by introducing an arbitrary function of @xmath19 into the measure .",
    "consequently , the multiplier @xmath19 is no longer completely free which also affects the remaining gauge freedom . )",
    "this explains why we get a finite result with independent @xmath16 , @xmath26 ; and it also demonstrates that here a finite model is _ anomalous_. as discussed in the introduction , the space - time discretization , which is not modeled here , presents a possible rescue for finite spin foam models . to check this , we need more general methods which will be introduced in what follows .",
    "since our model incorporated some of the essential steps of a spin foam quantization of gravity , it suggests that the same conclusions regarding the choice of amplitudes hold true in this more complicated case . in this section",
    "we discuss the continuous path integral and the correct measure in the presence of second class constraints , which will be necessary to derive the anomaly - free amplitudes .",
    "the characteristic feature of the gravitational action which is commonly used for a spin foam quantization is the presence of a constraint which restricts the allowed values of lagrange multipliers appearing in a simpler action . to find the correct measure it is not sufficient to work solely in a lagrangian formulation ; in particular it is essential to understand the structure of the constraint algebra which can only be achieved in a hamiltonian analysis .",
    "the constraint algebra in this context is always mixed ( i.e.  neither purely first class nor purely second class ) and rather complicated .",
    "there are always the usual diffeomorphism constraints of gravity which must form a suitable first class sub - algebra , but in this particular formulation there is also a second class contribution : a constraint which restricts the multipliers of other constraints must be second class . despite first appearance , even in the toy model the additional constraint is second class . although the constraints @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 poisson commute , one has to take into account that in this form they are constraints on a _",
    "non_-symplectic poisson manifold with coordinates @xmath74 where the standard definitions of dirac s classification do not apply ( see @xcite for a discussion and generalized definitions ) .",
    "one can easily introduce an equivalent constrained system which has constraints on a symplectic manifold by adding the momenta @xmath75 and @xmath76 conjugate to the restricted multipliers @xmath19 and @xmath20 , together with the constraints @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the constraints @xmath79 , @xmath80 are then defined on a symplectic manifold and now it is obvious that @xmath81 does not commute with all constraints .",
    "in fact @xmath81 and @xmath82 form a second class sub - algebra , @xmath83 , whereas @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are first class .    in the absence of constraints",
    "the invariant path integral measure is given by the determinant of the symplectic form which leads to @xmath87 for canonical coordinates @xmath88 .",
    "a similar treatment is not possible for the multiplier integration since multipliers form a lagrangian sub - manifold of the extended phase space such that the determinant of their symplectic structure would be zero .",
    "the measure is well - defined after solving the second class constraints ( and turning the first class constraints into second class ones by fixing the gauge ) , which leads to the symplectic structure following from the dirac bracket . for completeness",
    ", we will next show how to derive the correct treatment of the multiplier measure by requiring that after solving the constraints in the integral we obtain the determinant of the dirac symplectic structure @xcite .",
    "we start with a system with @xmath89 coordinates @xmath90 , @xmath91 on a symplectic phase space @xmath92 and @xmath93 second class constraints @xmath79 , @xmath94 .",
    "( there might be additional , first class constraints which are not relevant for this section .",
    "they can either be gauge fixed and included in the constraints @xmath79 or be left for later treatment , e.g.  factoring out the volume of their gauge orbits .",
    "the second possibility is particularly interesting here since a gauge fixing is sometimes claimed to be unnecessary for spin foam models of gravity . )",
    "the path integral ( where the constraint part has been split off the action @xmath95 ) then is @xmath96 with a function @xmath97 for the multiplier measure which will be determined shortly .",
    "this function must not depend on the @xmath98 because otherwise the multiplier integration would not yield @xmath66-functions of the constraints . with a @xmath99-independent @xmath100 we can perform the @xmath99 integrations explicitly and obtain @xmath101    to proceed further we transform from the coordinates @xmath90 , @xmath91 to coordinates @xmath102 with @xmath103 , @xmath94 ( assuming that the constraints are regular and irreducible such that they can be used as local coordinates on @xmath104 ) . to find the jacobian of this transformation we use the fact that locally the symplectic manifold @xmath92 can be represented as @xmath105 using the following notation .",
    "the symplectic manifold @xmath106 is the constraint surface @xmath107 defined by @xmath108 , @xmath94 , endowed with the dirac symplectic structure @xmath109 .",
    "the manifold @xmath110 is given by the image of a neighborhood of a point in @xmath111 under the functions @xmath112 ( i.e.  @xmath110 is a neighborhood of @xmath113 in @xmath114 ; for our purposes it is sufficient to know @xmath110 only locally ) and coordinatized by @xmath115 , @xmath94 .",
    "if the constraint algebra is closed , @xmath110 can be defined globally and is a poisson manifold with poisson tensor @xmath116 defined by @xmath117 where the bracket on the right hand side is computed using the symplectic structure @xmath118 on @xmath104 @xcite . for second class constraints",
    "the inverse of @xmath116 exists and @xmath119 is a symplectic manifold .",
    "if the constraint algebra is not closed , the poisson tensor @xmath116 depends not only on the coordinates @xmath79 of @xmath110 , but also on the coordinates of @xmath111 such that @xmath120 as a symplectic manifold depends on the point in @xmath111 chosen for its definition .",
    "the right component of the product decomposition of @xmath104 then depends on a point in the left component , which is indicated by the subscript @xmath111 of the symbol @xmath121 . that the decomposition is valid locally can be shown using the methods of @xcite where it has been proven for a closed algebra",
    "here we use this local decomposition to factor the original symplectic structure @xmath122 which allows us to perform the coordinate transformation in the last integral , @xmath123 since @xmath124 are coordinates on the constraint surface , their path integral measure must be given by the dirac symplectic structure .",
    "if there is any other non - constant function besides the exponential of the action , the measure will not be invariant and the path integral will be anomalous .",
    "therefore , the function @xmath97 has to be @xmath125 which fixes the free function in the original integral ( strictly speaking , @xmath100 is only fixed on the constraint surface ) . in the presence of second class constraints , therefore , the path integral to start with is @xmath126 which requires a detailed knowledge of the constraint algebra .",
    "note that the determinant of the constraint brackets also appears in this form when first class constraints @xmath127 are gauge fixed a la faddeev  popov , where the other half of the second class constraints @xmath79 are gauge fixing conditions @xmath128 : . ] in this case the measure contains a function @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a gauge fixing condition for the first class constraint @xmath127 and @xmath131 its gauge parameter .",

    "note that the additional factor can be ignored when it is constant on the constraint surface , which is always the case for a closed constraint algebra .",
    "in particular , our toy model has a closed algebra and so our treatment was correct even though we ignored the additional factor in the measure .",
    "for more complicated systems including gravity in the plebanski formulation , however , this is not expected to be the case .",
    "@xmath0-theory is important in what follows because it appears as an intermediate step in the definition of the gravitational spin foam model . in this section",

    "( one also has to replace @xmath238 with @xmath239 , but since both expressions represent a @xmath66-function in @xmath240 , they can be regarded as identical . ) this clarifies the relation between continuous values for @xmath23 and the discrete @xmath186 .",

    "discretizing @xmath236 then yields the correct face amplitude ( section [ qbf ] ) .      for theories more complicated than @xmath0-theory , but still written as constrained @xmath0-theory , we have to combine the result of section  [ measure ] , which tells us the correct continuum measure in the presence of second class constraints , with a transition from the continuum measure to discrete amplitudes .",

    "involved we have included an example of constrained @xmath0-theory in the appendix .",
    "it is also not easy to decide which part of the constraint algebra one has to consider .",
    "all constraints taken together form a mixed system containing first class constraints . usually , as in section  [ measure ] , one would have to gauge fix the first class constraints resulting in a pure second class algebra .",
    "however , for gravity a gauge fixing is not known , and it is hoped that spin foam models can avoid the need to introduce an explicit gauge fixing by using a space - time discretization . in the following subsection we will see however that simple considerations of background independence with respect to active diffeomorphisms imply the existence of bubble divergences which are naturally associated to infinite gauge volume contributions .",
    "diffeomorphisms in fact seem not to be completely gauge fixed by the discretization and the situation might be similar to that of @xmath0-theory reviewed in the previous sections .",
    "one then would have to find a second class sub - algebra of the full constraint system plus the appropriate gauge fixing constraint in order to compute the correct measure .",
    "it seems necessary to look for a description of gauge symmetries and constraint algebra that would be directly defined at the discrete level . in the previous section",
    "we have reviewed how this can be done in the case of @xmath0-theory .",
    "indeed , in order to regularize the path integral freidel and louapre had to introduce a gauge fixing of the topological symmetry ( [ topo ] ) which in turn modifies the measure by the faddeev - popov determinant ( [ fp ] ) . in the case of this topological theory",
    "the modification is trivial and the factor is independent of the fields reducing simply to unity . in the case of gravity",
    "one should expect a non trivial dependence on spins consistent with a theory with local excitations .",
    "it is clear from this example that even when the gauge symmetries of the discrete action retain some similarities with the continuum ones their action can be only interpreted at the discrete level .",
    "an equivalent analysis in the case of 4-dimensional plebanski theory seems necessary in order to implement the general prescription of subsection  [ gre ] for the construction of the measure and hence settle the issue of lower dimensional simplex amplitudes .",
    "in such a context , the first class part of the constraint algebra might not even be first class in the continuum sense as results of gambini and pullin show @xcite . in this case a direct application of our recipe ( or a slight generalization ) should be feasible .",
    "in this section we will show how the requirement of background independence and diffeomorphism invariance from the active point of view imposes restrictions on the spin foam amplitudes with important consequences . for concreteness",
    ", we will focus the attention on the barrett  crane model for quantum gravity in the formulation of simplicial quantum gravity presented in @xcite .",
    "the requirements imposed here on the spin foam amplitudes can be viewed as a 4-dimensional generalization of the notion of cylindrical consistency and diffeomorphism invariance in the canonical formulation of loop quantum gravity @xcite . according to background independence ,",
    "the cellular decomposition used to represent the space - time manifold does not carry any physical information .",
    "gravitational degrees of freedom are encoded in the labeling of faces in the dual 2-complex with irreducible representations of the corresponding internal gauge group : a spin foam . as a consequence there remains some redundant information in a spin foam defined on a particular 2-complex which links the ` physical ' configuration with the discretization on which it has been defined .",
    "the background independent information is encoded in appropriate equivalence classes of spin foams .",
    "these equivalence classes have to be introduced if one wants to think of spin foams as morphisms in the spin network category @xcite , and are defined by the following moves :    1 .   _ ( piecewise linear ) maps preserving the cell - complex and its coloring _ 2 .",
    "_ subdivision _ 3 .",
    "_ orientation reversal _    a detailed definition can be found in @xcite .",
    "these moves can be interpreted as the counterpart of diffeomorphisms in simplicial quantum gravity ( with perhaps the addition of more equivalence relations if the remnant of diffeomorphism invariance is larger as in @xmath0-theory ) .",
    "transformations given by arbitrary combinations of the moves are clearly limited and the resulting equivalence relation is much weaker than complete discretization independence which would be the requirement for a topological quantum field theory . the most important move is the second one since the others leave the number and connections of simplices invariant .",
    "an illustration of the limited scope of the moves can be seen in fig .",
    "[ vb ] where only one new edge and two new vertices are created while the rest is unchanged .",
    "thus , the discretizations have to be regarded as defining equivalent backgrounds which are just parameterized differently .",
    "( this point is different from lattice gauge theories in a given background where a new edge would probe new degrees of freedom . )",
    "the natural amplitude for faces in spin foam models is given by the plancherel measure arising in the harmonic analysis on the corresponding internal gauge group .",
    "this can be derived in various ways and it is directly linked with the notion of locality of spin foams @xcite , namely that degrees of freedom communicate along faces by boundary data given by the connection . if the face amplitude @xmath244 is given by the plancherel measure ( e.g. , @xmath245 in the case of the riemannian barrett  crane model ) then the arbitrary subdivision of a face @xmath172 does not change the amplitude . connections for which the plancherel measure iduces a face amplitude @xmath246 . in spin foam models based on @xmath6 @xmath0-theory",

    "the previous analysis raises the question of whether we can find more stringent conditions on spin foam amplitudes by solely imposing background independence .",
    "the simplest consistency condition can be obtained by the requirement that the bubble spin foams of figures [ vb ] and [ vb1 ] have the same amplitude .",
    "the figure represents spin foams where most of the faces are labeled by the trivial representation except for the shown bubbles , labeled by the simple representation @xmath247 .",
    "these spin foams are clearly equivalent under the above moves and the figures illustrate the sequence of moves that relate them .",
    "this is also in agreement with our intuitive notion of background independence ( see @xcite for more discussion ) : given that the underlying 2-complex does not carry any geometrical information and that geometry degrees of freedom are represented by the labeling of faces with spins and its intrinsic combinatorics there is no background independent way to distinguish between these bubble spin foam excitations .",
    "their apparent difference is linked to the fiducial background 2-complex used to represent them and should not play any physical role .",

    "is the model dependent of this folliation ?",
    "the answer is no . at the classical level ,",

    "] there is thus no additional factor from the constraint algebra and the lower dimensional amplitudes agree with those of @xmath0-theory .",
    "this is in agreement with the minimal requirements used here , which thus turn out to be sufficient in this case .",
    "the aim of this paper is to point out the need to check the anomaly problem for spin foam models which in this context means that lower dimensional simplex amplitudes are not free but essentially fixed .",
    "this is illustrated by the toy model of section  [ tm ] which demonstrates that without the correct amplitudes non - physical results arise .    in order to find an anomaly - free formulation one has to study the constraint algebra which in spin foam models for gravity , formulated as a restricted @xmath0-theory , generally involves second class constraints . for a complicated constraint algebra this requires a non - trivial function in the measure which has been overlooked before .",
    "we have proposed a way to address the issue of computing the measure in a simplicial theory using the classical phase space structure . to get the face and edge amplitude of the discrete spin foam model we have seen that it is helpful to introduce polar coordinates for the @xmath23-field since it provides a direct link to the spin parameters of the state sum .",
    "explicit calculations require several integrations which , if not possible to be done explicitly , are well - suited for a stationary phase approximation .",
    "a detailed study is necessary in order to be able to judge if amplitudes of a particular model would be finite .",
    "even though we have not explicitly computed the anomaly free measure for spin foam models of gravity we have pointed out that some minimal requirements from the related condition of background independence can be imposed that severely restrict the value of the face and edge amplitudes .",
    "the restrictions imposed by background independence in the way presented here seem to imply that bubble divergences in spin foam models for gravity are linked with the gauge action of diffeomorphisms , and rule out some proposals in the literature .",
    "in particular , without modification of the singular edge amplitude ( associated with edges bounded by less than four faces ) , the finite normalizations for both the riemannian and lorentzian barrett  crane model proposed in @xcite are to be regarded as formulations where the diffeomorphism gauge symmetry has been broken by an anomalous path integral measure .",
    "other anomalous formulations are : the new normalization of the barrett  crane model proposed in @xcite to improve the convergence properties of the previous model and model a in @xcite .",
    "this seems to severely limit the physical relevance of such proposals .",
    "model b in @xcite is the only normalization of the barrett ",
    "crane model which satisfies the minimal requirements of background independence presented here and is the one naturally arising in the quantization of plebanski s @xmath6 formulation of gravity presented in @xcite .",
    "however , a non trivial modification of the edge amplitude for generic edges should appear due to the contribution of the simplicity constraints as argued in section  [ measure ] .    the value of the correct edge amplitude can be determined if we understand the canonical algebra of simplicity constraints so that the appropriate determinant as in ( [ zsec ] ) is included .",
    "this is a complicated issue as it might require the understanding of the canonical formulation of the simplicial model .",
    "perhaps the ideas of gambini and pullin in the context of their _ consistent discretization _",
    "formulation might shed some new light on this issue .",
    "unfortunately the canonical formulation of discrete theories seems rather complicated in the case of plebanski s formulation at this stage .",
    "an interesting alternative procedure to deal with constrained systems is the projection - operator approach @xcite .",
    "since this method allows to deal with first and second class constraints on an equal footing , it may be possible to sidestep some of the difficulties mentioned above .",
    "the well understood results in 3-dimensional gravity @xcite and those of section [ dc ] suggest that the discretization does not completely fix the diffeomorphism gauge transformations as it is usually assumed . in the case of the barrett",
    " crane model ( any other model could be analyzed in this way ) we have shown that the minimal requirements for background independence already imply the presence of certain bubble divergences that have no physical content .",
    "for instance , even in our toy ( husain  kucha ) spin foam model divergences can not be avoided without some extra manipulation .",
    "these divergences will be present in any spin foam model for a background independent theory and the way to deal with them is by appropriate gauge fixing conditions . for this",
    ", one needs to understand in a precise manner the action of diffeomorphisms in the context of the simplicial models .",
    "our minimal requirements of background independence of section [ dc ] are closely related to the action of 3-diffeomorphisms in loop quantum gravity ( it is tempting to think that due to the fact that our requirements hold for any ` slicing ' of the spin foam one is imposing a ` bit ' of 4-diffeos in this picture ) . in this sense , what is left to understand is the old questions : where is the remnant gauge transformation encoded in the action of the hamiltonian constraint in the canonical framework ? , and can we expect to be able to separate the physical dynamics from the gauge evolution by a closer analysis of the vertex amplitude ?    in the barrett  crane model we constrain the @xmath23 field to be given by a simple bivector field derived from a tetrad . at the spin foam level , @xmath6 representations are constrained to simple representations @xmath291 .",
    "the essential questions are : what part of ` translational ' gauge freedom ( [ topo ] ) in the @xmath23 s of @xmath6 @xmath0-theory remains after the implementation of the simplicity constraints ? namely : is this gauge symmetry remnant fully encoded in the equivalence class of spin foams defined by baez ? , or is there also a symmetry that can change the values of the representation labels as in @xmath0-theory ?    in the first scenario",
    "the gauge divergence structure of the model does not seem problematic .",
    "we have seen in section [ measure ] that in addition to the faddeev ",
    "popov factor coming from gauge fixing first class constraints the measure should be modified when implementing the simplicity constraints . from the analysis of section [ dc ]",
    "we conclude that this modification should involve the value of the edge amplitude for non - singular edges .",
    "the implementation of the simplicity constraints could modify the amplitudes in a way that would make non - singular bubble amplitudes finite .",
    "one could think of the non trivial damping edge amplitude of the finite model @xcite as arising in this way for non - singular edges .",
    "these factors must not arise for singular edges bounding only two non trivial faces as our consistency argument fixes the edge amplitude to unity in these cases . in this scenario",
    "the divergence structure of the ( non - gauge fixed ) amplitudes would be similar to that of our toy model of section  [ dc ] : only the vacuum bubbles as the ones represented in figures [ vb ] or [ vb1 ] would be the divergent contributions to the amplitudes and can be easily regularized .    in the second scenario , it is appealing to think that the sum over representations ` flowing ' inside a bubble is un - physical and its contribution corresponds to the diffeomorphism gauge volume .",
    "gauge fixing will correspond to dropping these redundant sums and replace them by the appropriate faddeev ",
    "popov determinants of section [ measure ] . in the case of @xmath0-theory topological",
    "invariance follows from the triviality of these faddeev ",
    "popov determinants . in the case of gravity",
    "these factors should depend in a non - trivial fashion on the spins as the correct model must contain local excitations .",
    "we are grateful to a ashtekar , d christensen , l freidel , r gambini , j klauder , j pullin , c rovelli and t thiemann for discussions and to j klauder for hospitality to one of us ( mb ) .",
    "we also thank the erwin schrdinger institute , vienna , where part of the work has been done at the workshop `` quantum field theory in curved spacetime '' .",
    "this work was supported in part by nsf grant phy00 - 90091 and the eberly research funds of penn state .",
    "in this appendix we illustrate how the study of the integrals that define the amplitude of spin foam models obtained by discretizing a continuous action can be used to find the correct normalization of the spin foam measure ( in the large spin limit ) .",
    "the example presented here is a little bit more involved than the one of subsection  [ bfp ] and is closely related to the barrett - crane model .",
    "even though the analog of simplicity constraints is present in this example , it should be pointed out that our analysis here has an important limitation : we are not including the determinant factors appearing in ( [ zsec ] ) produced by the implementation of second class constraints in the path integral .",
    "this example is however meant as a computation that illustrates the difficulties involved in the analysis .",
    "we have kept this calculation as an appendix hoping that the technique can be useful for further developments .",
    "a degenerate sector of euclidean gravity can be obtained by introducing the additional constraint @xcite @xmath292 into @xmath2 @xmath0-theory where @xmath293 and @xmath294 are @xmath166 valued components of the @xmath295 valued @xmath23 according to the decomposition @xmath203 , and @xmath296 is an @xmath297-matrix .",
    "the new action then is @xmath298 where @xmath299 and @xmath300 denote the curvatures of the left and right component of the connection , respectively . in this form ,",
    "@xmath301 and @xmath302 appear as new lagrange multipliers in addition to the multipliers @xmath303 and @xmath304 of the original @xmath0-theory .",
    "only the multipliers @xmath305 and some components of @xmath306 are restricted by the new constraints and in order to obtain a constrained system on a symplectic phase space we have to add their momenta to the canonical variables together with constraints requiring them to be zero . for a discussion of the finiteness of the resulting model it is most interesting to see whether or not additional factors in the measure depend on components of @xmath23 with a non - trivial scaling behavior since this would affect the large-@xmath186 behavior of face amplitudes .",
    "this has to be expected here because varying @xmath302 yields a constraint which restricts components of the multipliers @xmath306 and is linear in @xmath23 .",
    "since we had to add momenta of these components of @xmath306 , the constraint algebra will contribute positive powers of @xmath23 to the measure which would enhance a divergence . here , however , we do not discuss the constraints in detail but rather ignore the additional factor and derive the large-@xmath186 behavior of the face amplitude for the naive spin foam quantization with trivial multiplier measure . while the resulting amplitude would not be correct",
    ", our aim here is solely to compare it with the result of @xcite where this factor has been ignored , too .    to include the additional constraint into a spin foam quantization we impose it face - wise such that any face @xmath307 carries a matrix @xmath308",
    "this gives the state sum @xmath309 where @xmath310 are lagrange multipliers and the edge holonomies @xmath311 form the holonomies @xmath312 and @xmath313 along closed loops .",
    "integrating over @xmath310 yields @xmath66-functions which will be solved after introducing polar coordinates @xmath314 for @xmath315 and euler angles",
    "@xmath316 for @xmath296 .",
    "the @xmath66-functions then imply @xmath317 for all faces @xmath307 , and @xmath318 and @xmath319 will be given as functions @xmath320 according to @xmath321 and @xmath322 . choosing again a gauge for @xmath323 without loss of generality , we obtain @xmath324 we now have to perform the angle integrations , which is effectively a four - dimensional integral since the @xmath325- and @xmath326-integrations are trivial , in order to find the face amplitude after discretizing @xmath327 .",
    "one can use the saddle point approximation , but has to be careful because the integrand has zeroes due to the sines . disregarding the zeroes",
    ", one would expect the asymptotic behavior of the angle integral to be @xmath328 because every one - dimensional integration contributes @xmath329 in the standard stationary phase result .",
    "this factor would cancel the @xmath330 from the measure and thus yield @xmath143 as the large-@xmath186 behavior of the face amplitude . in @xcite a face amplitude",
    "@xmath331 has been obtained for this model by different means , however for a different discretization of the action which is not accessible to our methods .",
    "nevertheless , there is agreement provided that the modified discretization in @xcite leads to the standard stationary phase result .",
    "an analysis similar to that of section  [ dc ] would lead to the conclusion that such a face amplitude is in conflict with background independence .",
