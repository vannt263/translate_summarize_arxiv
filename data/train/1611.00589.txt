    "the stochastic control theory has been extended to consider path - dependence in the state variable @xmath10 , see for example @xcite .",
    "this generalization is fundamentally different from the one pursued in our paper , which will become clear in the sections to follow .",
    "+ path - dependent controls are still incipient in theory and applications of stochastic control and differential games .",
    "this is very likely related to the lack of theoretical tools to deal with such objects in an appropriate way .",
    "we hope this work will provide a useful framework .",
    "+ for example , in @xcite and @xcite , the authors considered a class of problems that exhibit a particular type of path - dependence in the control , namely delayed controls .",
    "the method implemented there is the classical infinite dimensional analysis and they derived an infinite dimensional hjb equation .",
    "however , their method is strongly related to the delay - type of path - dependence .",

    "+ our approach uses the functional it calculus framework , introduced by bruno dupire in the seminal paper @xcite , which allows us to consider more general path - dependence structures .",
    "although our method could be also seen as an infinite dimensional analysis , it is rather different than the one applied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our method delivers a simpler hjb equation that can be applied to virtually any path - dependence structure in the control .",
    "our assumptions are mainly related to the well - posedness of the optimal control problem ( smoothness , measurability and integrability ) .",
    "functional it calculus was applied to the stochastic control problem of portfolio optimization with bounded memory in @xcite .",
    "however , this reference does not deal with path - dependence in the control , only on the state of the system .",

    "in the case when the path @xmath27 lies in a multidimensional space , the path deformations above are understood as follows : the flat extension is applied to all dimension jointly and equally and the bump is applied to each dimension individually .",
