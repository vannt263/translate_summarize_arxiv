    "diffractive vector meson production in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 stands for the target nucleus and @xmath5 for the final state it may dissociate into , is a process in which elastic and inelastic interactions of the target can be experimentally distinguished . at high energies , the @xmath6 dipole that the virtual photon has fluctuated into scatters off the gluonic field of the nucleus before recombining into the vector meson .",
    "while this scattering involves a color - singlet exchange , leaving a rapidity gap in the final state , the nucleus can still interact elastically ( @xmath7 this is called coherent diffraction ) or inelastically ( _ i.e. _ break up , called incoherent diffraction ) .",
    "kinematically , a low invariant mass of the system @xmath5 corresponds to a large rapidity gap in the final state between that system and the vector meson , and implies that the longitudinal momentum of the meson is close to that of the incoming photon . in this case",
    ", the eikonal approximation can be assumed to compute the dipole - nucleus scattering . at small values of @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the photon virtuality , @xmath10 the vector meson mass , and @xmath11 the energy of the @xmath12 collision ,",
    "a target proton can also be considered . indeed in that case , since partons with an energy fraction as small as @xmath0 are probed in the target wave function , the dipole will scatter off large gluon densities generated by the qcd evolution .",
    "the cross - section is maximal at minimum momentum transfer with exclusive production ( or coherent diffraction ) dominating .",
    "as the transfer of momentum gets larger , the role of incoherent diffraction increases and eventually it becomes dominant , typically for momenta bigger that the inverse target size ; the elastic contribution decreases exponentially while the inelastic contribution decreases only as a power law . in the case of a target proton",
    ", it is known that saturation models describe well the exclusive cross section @xcite , while the bfkl pomeron exchange approach works well for the target - dissociation cross - section @xcite .    in this work we show that , with the color glass condensate ( cgc ) picture of the small@xmath13 part of the hadronic / nuclear wave function , both coherent and incoherent diffraction can be described in the same framework , for protons and nuclei .",
    "we also explicitly calculate both contributions to the diffractive vector meson production cross - section using the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model for the cgc wave function .",
    "finally , we discuss phenomenological consequences in the context of a future electron - ion collider @xcite .",
    "the cgc is an effective theory of qcd @xcite which aims at describing the small @xmath0 part of the hadronic / nuclear wave function , when the gluon density is so large that non - linear effects are important . rather than using a standard fock - state decomposition , it is more efficient to describe it with collective degrees of freedom , more adapted to account for the collective behavior of the small-@xmath0 gluons , which do not interact with a probe independently , but rather behave coherently .",
    "the cgc approach uses classical color fields : @xmath14\\ |{\\cal a}\\rangle \\label{cgc}\\ .\\ ] ] the long - lived , large-@xmath0 partons are represented by a strong color source @xmath15 which is static during the lifetime of the short - lived small-@xmath0 gluons , whose dynamics is described by the color field @xmath16 @xmath17 denotes an arbitrary separation between the field and the source .",
    "the cgc wavefunction @xmath18 $ ] is the fundamental object of this picture , it is mainly a non - perturbative quantity , but the @xmath17 evolution can be computed perturbatively . requiring that observables are independent of the choice of @xmath19",
    "a functional renormalization group equation can be derived . in the leading - logarithmic approximation which resums powers of @xmath20 the jimwlk equation @xcite",
    "describes the evolution of @xmath21|^2 $ ] with @xmath22 the information contained in the wavefunction , on gluon number and gluon correlations , can be expressed in terms of n - point correlators , probed in scattering processes .",
    "these correlators consist of wilson lines averaged with the cgc wavefunction , and resum powers of @xmath23    in diffractive vector meson production , the relevant quantity is ( the photon is a right mover , the cgc a left mover , and the gauge is @xmath24 ) : @xmath25=1-\\frac{1}{n_c } \\mbox{tr}\\left(u^\\dagger_{\\textbf{y}}u_{\\textbf{x}}\\right)\\ , \\quad\\mbox{with } u_{\\textbf{x}}[{\\cal a}^-]={\\cal p } \\exp\\left(ig_s\\int dz^+ t^c { \\cal a}_c^-(z^+,\\textbf{x})\\right)\\ . \\label{wline}\\ ] ] in terms of this object , the differential cross sections for a transversely ( t ) or longitudinally ( l ) polarized photon are given by ( with @xmath26 the momentum transfer squared ) @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 with @xmath30^*\\phi_{\\lambda}^{h\\bar{h}}(z,\\textbf{r})\\ , \\label{overlap}\\ ] ] the overlap between the photon and meson wave functions . @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote polarizations and helicities while @xmath33 is the longitudinal momentum fraction of the photon carried by the quark and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the quark and antiquark positions in the transverse plane .",

    "instead , when also including the target - dissociative part , the diffractive cross section involves the 4-point correlator @xmath42 in order to compute it , we must specify more about the cgc wave function . we shall use the mclerran - venugopalan ( mv ) model @xcite , which is a gaussian distribution for the color charges which generate the field @xmath43 @xmath44|^2=\\exp\\left(-\\int d^2xd^2y dz^+ \\frac{\\rho_c(z^+,\\textbf{x})\\rho_c(z^+,\\textbf{y})}{2\\mu^2(z^+)}\\right)\\ , \\label{mv}\\ ] ] where the color charge @xmath45 and the field @xmath46 obey the yang - mills equation @xmath47 the variance of the distribution is the transverse color charge density squared along the projectile s path @xmath48 with @xmath49 the only parameter is the saturation momentum @xmath50 with @xmath51 proportional to the integrated color density squared .",
    "note that there is no @xmath0 dependence in the mv model , it should be considered as an initial condition to the small@xmath13 evolution .",
    "the mv distribution is a gaussian distribution , therefore one can compute any target average by expanding the wilson lines in powers of @xmath52 ( see ( [ wline ] ) ) , and then use wick s theorem @xcite .",
    "all correlators of @xmath53 s can be written in terms of @xmath54 with the two - dimensional massless propagator @xmath55 the color algebra is the difficult part to deal with .",
    "we give the result for the @xmath56 correlator @xcite , with @xmath57 @xmath58}}_{=\\langle s_{\\textbf{xy}}\\rangle\\langle s_{\\textbf{uv}}\\rangle}\\ \\left[\\left(\\frac{f(\\textbf{x},\\textbf{u};\\textbf{y},\\textbf{v})\\!+\\!\\sqrt{\\delta}}{2\\sqrt{\\delta } } -\\frac{f(\\textbf{x},\\textbf{y};\\textbf{u},\\textbf{v})}{n_c^2\\sqrt{\\delta}}\\right ) e^{\\frac{n_c}4\\mu^2\\sqrt{\\delta}}\\right.\\nonumber\\\\\\left.- \\left(\\frac{f(\\textbf{x},\\textbf{u};\\textbf{y},\\textbf{v})\\!-\\!\\sqrt{\\delta}}{2\\sqrt{\\delta } } -\\frac{f(\\textbf{x},\\textbf{y};\\textbf{u},\\textbf{v})}{n_c^2\\sqrt{\\delta}}\\right ) e^{-\\frac{n_c}4\\mu^2\\sqrt{\\delta}}\\right ] \\",
    "e^{-\\frac{n_c}4\\mu^2f(\\textbf{x},\\textbf{u};\\textbf{y},\\textbf{v } ) + \\frac1{2n_c}\\mu^2f(\\textbf{x},\\textbf{y};\\textbf{u},\\textbf{v})},\\label{mainresult}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 this seemingly complicated object is given in terms of a single function : @xmath60 ^ 2\\ .\\ ] ] indeed also one has @xmath61    in the function @xmath62 the infrared cutoff @xmath63 only enters through a logarithm as expected . in the @xmath64 limit",
    ", one has @xmath65 this is the standard definition of the saturation scale in the mv model .",
    "it is also possible to consistently include small@xmath13 evolution in a such a calculation , in the large@xmath66 limit @xcite and beyond @xcite .",
    "essentially one should replace @xmath67 by @xmath68 in ( [ mv ] ) , and the @xmath0 evolution of the corresponding @xmath69 can be obtained from the jimwlk equation .    finally , note that in ( [ mainresult ] ) for @xmath70 or @xmath71 @xmath72 and one recovers the single dipole average .",
    "also , in the large@xmath66 limit , one has @xmath73 which means that at small@xmath74 the target - dissociative part of the diffractive cross - section in suppressed at large @xmath75 compared to the exclusive part .",
    "r0.45        the results presented in this section are obtained with the @xmath0 evolution of the saturation scale modeled as in @xcite : @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 for the case of a target proton .",
    "the collinear logarithm of @xmath79 ( see ( [ qsatmv ] ) ) is neglected , which corresponds to exact geometric scaling @xcite : @xmath80.$ ] as an illustration , the resulting cross - section for diffractive j/@xmath81 production is displayed in fig.1 , and separated into its coherent and incoherent contributions . the light - cone gaussian j/@xmath81 wave function @xcite has been used in ( [ overlap ] ) . at small values of @xmath82",
    "where coherent diffraction dominates , our results are in agreement with hera data @xcite ( one can get a better agreement with more realistic saturation models @xcite , but this is not our point ) .",
    "our model indicates that for @xmath83 or so ( this value slightly decreases when @xmath9 increases ) , incoherent diffraction starts to dominate .",
    "this may be the reason why the data on exclusive production stop : there is too much proton - dissociative ` background ' .",
    "we observe that this part of the cross - section decreases as a power law with @xmath1 rather than exponentially as the exclusive part does .    in the case of a target nucleus , we expect the following qualitative changes in the @xmath84 dependence . first , the low@xmath85 regime with elastic scattering of the nucleus will be dominant up to a smaller value of @xmath82 compared to the proton case , reflecting the bigger size of the nucleus .",
    "then , the nucleus - dissociative part will be split into two : an intermediate regime in momentum transfer up to about @xmath86 where the nucleus will predominantly break up into its constituents nucleons , and a large@xmath85 regime where the nucleons inside the nucleus will also break up , implying pion production in the @xmath5 system for instance .    the model discussed in this work",
    "is well adapted to describe the low- and large@xmath85 regimes , but not the intermediate regime since the constituent nucleons are absent from the description ( [ cgc ] ) .",
    "this problem has been addressed in a complementary setup in the case of inclusive diffraction off nuclei @xcite , and the coherent diffraction regime was found to be dominant up to about @xmath87 the vector meson production case will be addressed next . while in the proton case , both exclusive and diffractive processes can be measured , it is likely that at a future electron - ion collider , the exclusive cross section can not be extracted : when the momentum transfer is small enough for the nucleus to stay intact , then it will escape too close to the beam to be detectable . therefore the diffractive physics program will rely on our understanding of incoherent diffraction .",
