    "it is possible that some of the most exciting times in particle physics will come soon , as the upcoming large hadron collider ( lhc ) will enable us to probe the mechanism of electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the standard picture contains a single higgs state that couples to the other fundamental particles with an intensity proportional to their masses @xcite . in the case of fermions , the standard model ( sm ) higgs couplings are diagonal in flavour space , due to the fact that the higgs couplings and the fermion mass matrices are both diagonalised by the same bi - unitary rotations",
    "however , this picture ceases to remain valid in many extensions of the sm .",
    "for instance , in the general two higgs doublet model of type iii ( thdm - iii ) , where both higgs doublets couple to both types of up- and down - type fermions , there appear non - diagonal higgs couplings , which lead to interesting lepton flavour violating / flavour changing neutral current ( lfv / fcnc ) higgs phenomenology @xcite . in turn , even though the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is a type ii two - higgs doublet model ( thdm - ii ) at tree level  with additional mass and coupling relations enforced by supersymmetry ( susy )  this structure is not protected by any symmetry , so that loop effects can effectively render it a thdm - iii .",
    "in addition , the detection of neutrino oscillations @xcite seem to suggest that there is a large mixing between the second and third families in the lepton sector , which could also appear in new scenarios that are contained in some extensions of the sm @xcite . in particular , within susy models , the pattern of lfv effects at the planck or grand unification theory ( gut ) scales could be reflected in the structure of the soft susy - breaking terms , i.e. , in the slepton mass matrices , which in turn can communicate these to the higgs sector through radiative effects @xcite .",
    "detectable effects of lfv higgs couplings could show up in the decay @xmath18 , which is a particularly sensitive probe at large @xmath1 @xcite ( the ratio of the two higgs vacuum expectation values in the mssm ) , with a branching ratio ( br ) scaling as @xmath19 , a phenomenon which may render this mode detectable at the lhc .",
    "the relevance of the lfv higgs decay @xmath20 will refer to a generic higgs state .",
    "] for higgs phenomenology at the lhc was discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , within the context of several extensions of the sm .",
    "in particular , it was shown that a large br@xmath21 ( of order 0.0010.01 ) could easily be achieved in the thdm - iii . moreover .",
    "it was shown there that large lfv higgs couplings were not in conflict with any low energy constraints , such as lfv decays of @xmath22 s .",
    "calculations of the sm higgs br@xmath23 showed it to be be very suppressed ( @xmath24 ) whilst in the ( constrained ) mssm the corresponding rates could be enhanced for some of the higgs states .",
    "in this paper we are interested in discussing further aspects of lfv phenomenology entering the higgs sector of the mssm , by investigating the possibility of a new detection mode for heavy @xmath11 higgs bosons ( @xmath25 gev ) at the lhc .",
    "in particular , we shall demonstrate that the decays of the heavy neutral higgs bosons of the mssm to @xmath26 pairs are sizable and represent a very sensitive probe of lfv physics .",
    "we calculate the rates for the br@xmath27 , involving the heavy neutral mssm",
    "cp - even higgs state and the cp - odd one , and find that they can be as large as @xmath28 , for high values of @xmath1 , while those for the br@xmath29 , involving the light neutral mssm cp - even higgs state , remain rather small in comparison .",
    "furthermore , it should be recalled that mssm higgs production at hadron colliders is enhanced for large @xmath1 , both via gluon fusion and in association with @xmath30 pairs . moreover , in this @xmath1 regime , there appears a degeneracy for the masses of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states , which essentially doubles the event rate of the overall higgs signal .",
    "all such effects enable one then to reach detectable levels at the lhc for @xmath31 signals . finally , by extending previous studies on the signal - to - background separation at the lhc",
    ", we show that detection of @xmath11 lfv higgs decays into tau - muon pairs could be achieved for higgs masses as high as 600 gev . in short",
    ", these lfv decay modes can provide a new detection channel for the heavy higgs bosons of the mssm , which would in turn give not only important evidence for susy but also , along with the modes @xmath32 , @xmath18 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , probe the form of the neutrino yukawa mass matrix .",

    "one of the most attractive explanations for the observed neutrino masses  @xcite is the `` see - saw '' mechanism  @xcite , which includes dirac masses ( @xmath35 ) as well as majorana masses ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "atmospheric neutrino data favours a @xmath37 mass of about @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "thus , for dirac neutrino masses of the order of the corresponding up - quark masses , i.e. @xmath39 @xmath40 gev , as predicted in a gut such as so(10 ) , one finds that the right - handed majorana mass , @xmath36 , needs to be of order @xmath41 .",
    "majorana neutrino masses imply lfv within the minimal supersymmetric see - saw model , which is defined as the minimal supersymmetric standard model augmented by three heavy right - handed neutrinos , @xmath42mssm to indicate such an extension of the mssm .",
    "] , lfv interactions can be communicated directly from @xmath42 s to the sleptons and from these to the charged leptons and higgs bosons .",
    "the initial communication takes place through renormalisation group flow of the slepton mass matrices at energies between @xmath43 and @xmath36 .",
    "the presence of @xmath42 states at scales above @xmath36 leaves an imprint on the mass matrices of the sleptons , which propagates down to the electro - weak ( ew ) scale .",
    "this effect has been used to predict large brs for @xmath33 and @xmath34 within the mssm  @xcite .    to derive the effective lagrangian for the lfv lepton - higgs interactions , we begin with the yukawa lagrangian : -l=|l_r y_l l_l h_d +    and @xmath42 represent the right - handed charged leptons , left - handed lepton doublets and right - handed neutrinos , respectively , while @xmath44 denote the higgs doublets of the mssm .",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath36 are @xmath47 matrices in flavour space .",
    "we shall work in a basis in which both @xmath45 and @xmath36 have been diagonalised , but where @xmath46 remains an arbitrary complex matrix .",
    "lepton number is violated in this lagrangian due to the presence of the @xmath42 majorana mass term .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath48 slepton mass matrix is written in terms of @xmath49 blocks , as follows :    m^2 _ = , where m_ll^2 & = & m_^2+m_l^2 + m_z^0 ^ 2 2(t_3 -q _ ^2 _",

    "if we further assume that @xmath72 is an identity matrix , then @xmath73 will also be of @xmath67 .",
    "this source of lfv interactions can be transmitted to the higgs sector as well , because radiative effects could induce flavour mixing in the higgs couplings .",
    "these corrections allow the neutral higgs bosons to mediate fcncs , in particular @xmath32 @xcite can reach brs at large @xmath1 that can be probed by run  ii of the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "for the leptonic sector , the feynman graphs that induce such corrections involve loops of sleptons and charginos / neutralinos , which are transmitted further to induce lfv higgs couplings . to derive the susy - induced thdm - iii , one can write an effective lagrangian for the couplings of the charged leptons to the neutral higgs fields , namely :    -l=|l_r y_l e_l h_d^0 + |l_r y_l ( _ 1 * 1 * + _ 2 y_^y _ )",

    "the term proportional to @xmath84 will generate a mass shift for the charged leptons that will appear as a second - order effect @xcite .",
    "then , the lfv interactions relevant for the higgs sector phenomenology can be written in terms of higgs mass eigenstates as follows ( @xmath85 ) : -l__k l_il_j = [ ] ( ^_k_ij    @xmath86 , @xmath87 , with @xmath88 denoting the higgs mixing angle .",
    "constraints on the lfv @xmath89higgs interaction can be obtained from the lfv @xmath22-decays ( e.g. , @xmath90 ) , which can be generated via exchange of @xmath91 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "for instance , for the case in which @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , ref .",
    "@xcite finds that @xmath95 , which is stable with respect to changes in the susy spectrum .",
    "then @xmath96 , which puts the @xmath90 mode into a regime that is experimentally accessible at current b - factories .",
    "at the lhc and superkekb , limits in the region of @xmath97 should be achievable  @xcite , allowing an even deeper probe into the model parameter space . on the other hand",
    ", tevatron has already constrained the large @xmath1 domain , from the search for the decay @xmath98 @xcite , that seems to exclude the value @xmath12 , which is preferred by the requirement of yukawa unification .",
    "however , it is possible to evade such constraints , for instance in susy breaking scenarios where slepton and squark masses do not have any strong correlation . in any case , given that such limits depend on multiple mssm parameters , which makes it difficult to draw a general conclusion , it is certainly preferable to test the resulting lfv higgs couplings directly at the lhc , as it is discussed in the next section .",
    "lfv higgs decays have been evaluated within the general mssm with a particular ansatz for the trilinear @xmath65 terms in @xcite , where was found that a br@xmath100 could well be achieved .",
    "subsequently , refs . @xcite and @xcite presented a more detailed calculation of the br@xmath29 , within the mssm , which was essentially in agreement with the previous result .",
    "in fact , ref .",
    "@xcite also reported a complete one - loop calculation of the lfv higgs decay within the sm extension with massive neutrinos , using a realistic pattern of neutrino masses and mixings , which resulted in very suppressed lfv higgs decays ( with br of order @xmath101 or less ) .",
    "afterwards , @xcite presented a detailed study of the prospects to detect lfv higgs decays at the tevatron and lhc , concluding that it is certainly possible to detect such decays in the thdm - iii within the higgs mass range 114160 gev , approximately .",
    "later on , ref .",
    "@xcite presented a more realistic study of the signal and backgrounds , essentially reaching the same conclusions .",
    "subsequently , it was also studied in detail the mass - matrix ansatz used in the thdm - iii , by ref .",
    "@xcite , while the evaluation of the corresponding lfv higgs decays was presented in @xcite .",
    "mixing of the sm fermions with other exotic fermions was also shown to be a possible source of lfv in the higgs sector @xcite , resulting in brs of the order 0.01 - 0.001 again , which could clearly be detectable too .",
    "bounds on lfv higgs decays at the tevatron were reported by the cdf collaboration in @xcite .    in this paper we shall concentrate on the lfv heavy higgs decays to @xmath26 , which has a very small br within the context of the sm with light neutrinos , so that this channel is potentially an excellent window for probing new physics .",
    "although the previously mentioned works have studied lfv higgs decays within the @xmath0mssm , the specific evaluation of the brs of the lfv decays for @xmath11 in the heavy mass range has not been studied .",
    "hence a discussion of the corresponding detectability at the lhc has not been presented so far either .",
    "to remedy this is our aim in the present paper .    in order to derive the formulae for the lfv higgs decay widths , we notice that the quantity inside the square brackets in eq . (",
    "11 ) corresponds to the higgs - lepton coupling @xmath102 , which will be denoted by @xmath103 .",
    "thus , we can write the lfv higgs coupling @xmath104 as g_= g_| ^_ij . the decay width for the generic process @xmath105 ( in which we add both final states @xmath106 and @xmath107 )",
    "can then be written in terms of the higgs decay width @xmath108 , as follows : [ eq : width ] ( ) = 2 |^_|^2 ( ) , so that the lfv higgs br can in turn be approximated by br@xmath109 .",
    "we are interested in studying the large @xmath1 domain ( i.e. , @xmath110 ) , where the lfv higgs couplings are enhanced .",
    "it is also simpler to work in such so - called decoupling regime of the mssm higgs sector , which in fact is quite general since it is reached even for moderate values of @xmath111 ( @xmath112 gev ) . in this case",
    "we have that @xmath113 for @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the lfv decays of the light higgs boson ( @xmath91 ) are suppressed for most regions of parameter space .",
    "conversely , for the above mentioned choices of susy parameters yielding @xmath115 ( which we call set a ) and with @xmath116 gev , one obtains br@xmath117 , which in turn gives br@xmath118 for @xmath119 . for another set of parameters with a large @xmath52 limit , i.e. @xmath120 ( which we call set b ) , one gets @xmath121 , which will produce a larger br for @xmath122 .",
    "more in general , we calculate the lfv higgs decay rates in the channels @xmath31  by appropriately modifying the hdecay program @xcite and using the formula in eq .",
    "( [ eq : width ] )  as a function of the higgs masses and corresponding lfv higgs couplings .",
    "it is appropriate to mention at this point that reference @xcite did include a discussion of the lfv @xmath11 decays .",
    "however , the authors concentrated on the mass range below @xmath123 gev .",
    "they hint in fact that above this mass range the modes @xmath124 will be suppressed because the channels @xmath125 and @xmath126 would be open and dominate the total decay width",
    ". however , this is not true .",
    "the reason is twofold .",
    "firstly , the @xmath8  being a cp - odd state  does not couple to vector boson pairs . secondly , although the @xmath7 state does couple to @xmath125 and @xmath126 pairs , in the heavy higgs mass limit such coupling is considerably suppressed .",
    "our calculation takes correct care of these aspects .",
    "once one folds in the values of lfv higgs brs with the main heavy neutral higgs production modes at the lhc , it is clear that lfv higgs decays into @xmath9 pairs may be detectable at the cern hadron collider . as a benchmark , according to previous studies @xcite , with sm - like cross sections and @xmath127 gev , one could detect at the lhc the aforementioned lfv higgs decays with a br of order @xmath128 .",
    "we intend to push forward the region of detectability into higher mass values within the mssm , by exploiting the aforementioned @xmath1 enhancement and the fact that our lfv higgs brs become almost constant for heavier higgs masses . besides , for heavier higgs masses one should expect a much larger background reduction , as compared to the lower higgs mass case , owning to the much harder energy spectra for the emerging @xmath22- and @xmath52-leptons .",
    "as already mentioned , high values of @xmath1 are also associated with a large @xmath129-quark yukawa coupling , which in turn can produce an enhancement of the higgs production cross sections at hadron colliders via both gluon fusion and associated production with @xmath129-quark pairs : i.e. , @xmath130 ( via triangle loops at lowest order ) and @xmath6 ( at tree - level ) , respectively .",
    "( we calculate these two production processes here by using the higlu and hqq programs in default configurations  @xcite . )",
    "figure  [ fig : brs ] shows the relevant lfv higgs brs as a function of @xmath111 .",
    "the lfv br is basically the same for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 and its variation with @xmath111 is very mild . in figures  [ fig : events - ggha ] and",
    "[ fig : events - habb ] we present the expected lfv higgs event rates as a function of degenerate higgs mass @xmath131 for two values of @xmath132 and 60 and two values of lhc luminosities , @xmath133 and @xmath134 , respectively .",
    "it is clear from these two plots that lfv higgs rates con be substantial even at large higgs masses .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proposed a series of cuts to reconstruct the hadronic and electronic @xmath22 decays from @xmath135 and separate the signal from the background , which is dominated by @xmath22-pair production via drell - yan modes ( i.e. , @xmath136 ) and @xmath137 .",
    "in fact , it should be recalled that the decay product distributions of @xmath22-leptons generated in the decay of higgs bosons are notably different from those emerging in gauge boson decays , because of the different spin of the primary objects . a more realistic search strategy for the lhc based on the cuts of ref .",
    "@xcite was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where one can find detection efficiencies in the higgs mass range 120160 gev .",
    "the typical figure goes from about 2% for @xmath138 gev up to about 3% for @xmath139 gev , where it starts stabilising .",
    "although one expects that this detection efficiency will increase for heavier higgs masses , in order to use a conservative estimate , we shall use the 3% figure throughout in our estimates in the remainder of the paper .    adopting the background rates estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite for higgs masses up to 200 gev and trivially extrapolating them to heavier higgses , we are then in a position to compare the yield of our signals ( see figures  [ fig : events - ggha][fig : events - habb ] ) with that of the total background , thereby estimating both a 95% confidence level ( cl ) exclusion limit and a @xmath140 discovery reach .",
    "the scope of the lhc in both respects , as a function of the higgs masses and machine luminosity , is then well described by figures  [ fig : reach30 - 40 ] and [ fig : reach50 - 60 ] . to display our results",
    ", we have choosen the combinations @xmath119 and @xmath141 with susy parameters of set a , and @xmath142 and @xmath143 with susy parameters of set b. ( other combinations should lay within these results . ) clearly , with an integrated luminosity of 300 fb@xmath10 , for @xmath119 , one can detect a signal for higgs masses up to about 260 gev , which is already significantly above the @xmath144 mark of ref .",
    "@xcite , while , for @xmath12 , higgs masses up to even 600 gev can be probed .",
    "however , since for @xmath12 one is dangerously close to the bounds from @xmath145 , the reader may well refer instead to those for @xmath146 ( with susy parameters of set a ) and @xmath142 ( with susy parameters of set b ) . in these cases",
    "too we find that it will be possible to extract a lfv higgs signal at the lhc for heavy higgs masses , up to about 300(500 ) gev for @xmath146(50 ) with 300 fb@xmath10 of luminosity .",
    "we have demonstrated that lfv effects in the slepton sector of the @xmath0mssm can generate lfv couplings between leptons and neutral higgs bosons leading to large brs for lfv higgs decays into lepton pairs . in particular , we have calculated the brs of the processes @xmath147 and found that they can be as large as @xmath148 , while the br@xmath29 is only about @xmath149 . furthermore , these rates occur for large values of @xmath150 and @xmath1 , a configuration also responsible for a strong degeneracy between the masses ( and couplings ) of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states , producing an overall higgs event rate which is double the one of either higgs state alone .",
    "these lfv higgs modes can be extracted at the lhc for higgs masses slightly beyond 600 gev , provided @xmath12 . for smaller values of this parameter though the lhc scope greatly diminishes , reducing to just above 260 gev in higgs mass for @xmath119 .",
    "these values can only be reached at 300 fb@xmath10 of luminosity .",
    "however , even with a modest 10 fb@xmath10 , one could probe higgs masses up to 400(415 ) gev , provided @xmath142(60 ) . besides , in view of the assumptions made on detection efficiencies for the signal , we believe these conclusions to be rather conservative .",
    "altogether , these novel channels complement the modes @xmath32 , @xmath18 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 in order to provide evidence for susy and key insights into the form of the neutrino yukawa mass matrix .",

    "<S> within the @xmath0mssm , a minimal supersymmetric neutrino see - saw model , lepton flavour violating higgs couplings are strongly enhanced at large @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , which can lead to br@xmath3 , for @xmath4 gev . </S>",
