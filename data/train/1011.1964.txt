    "in the naive quark model , the nucleon consists of three valence up and down quarks .",
    "this picture is made more precise by taking account of quantum effects based on quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the fundamental theory of strong interaction , with which one expects additional effects due to the gluon and sea quark degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , in high energy hadron scatterings , these effects are observed as parton distributions of the gluon and sea quarks , which can be analyzed using perturbative calculations of qcd . at low energy , quantitative calculation of the sea quark effect",
    "is far more difficult because of the nonperturbative nature of qcd . in this work",
    ", we consider the nucleon strange quark content @xmath7 .",
    "this matrix element directly measures the effect of sea quark , because there is no valence strange quark in the nucleon .",
    "the nucleon strange quark content represents the effect of strange quark on the mass of the nucleon , which is often parametrized by @xmath8 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the masses of strange quark and nucleon .",
    "@xmath9 is the scalar operator made of strange quark fields .",
    "this parameter is also relevant to the dark matter searches , as one of the candidates neutralino in the supersymmetric models may interact with the nucleon most strongly through its strange quark content via the higgs boson exchange diagram @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the matrix element @xmath7 is therefore directly related to the sensitivity of the present @xcite and future experiments .",
    "another quantity of physical interest is a ratio of strange quark and light ( up and down ) quark contents : @xmath10 the denominator @xmath11 corresponds to the nucleon @xmath12 term , which is relatively well - determined as it is related to an amplitude of the pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath7 , for which only lattice qcd can potentially make a quantitative prediction .    .",
    "lines show quark propagators that are dressed by virtual gluons and sea quarks in qcd .",
    "the connected three lines correspond to the nucleon propagation and the disconnected loop arises from the strange scalar operator @xmath9 . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the numerical calculation of the matrix element @xmath7 on the lattice is not straightforward , because it involves a disconnected quark - loop diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] . with the conventional method to calculate the quark propagator in lattice qcd",
    ", the computational cost to obtain the disconnected quark loop is prohibitively high , as one has to perform an expensive inversion of the dirac operator for sources located at every lattice sites ; the computational cost is then proportional to the lattice volume squared , @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , since the scalar operator @xmath9 may have nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , which is divergent when @xmath5 is finite , one has to subtract this vev contribution to extract the physical matrix element @xmath7 .",
    "this requires a large cancellation that induces a large statistical error .    in this work",
    ", we overcome these practical difficulties in the lattice calculation by using the methods of the low - mode averaging @xcite and the all - to - all propagator @xcite .",
    "the all - to - all propagator allows us to calculate the propagation of the quark between arbitrary lattice sites at once , by introducing a stochastic estimator ( for a practical implementation , see below ) .",
    "although it introduces additional statistical noise , the low - mode averaging eliminates the noise for physically relevant low - lying quark - mode contributions and improves the statistics by averaging over space - time lattice sites .",
    "these techniques are crucial for the calculation of the disconnected diagram in lattice qcd .",
    "another important advantage of this work over the previous lattice calculations of @xmath7 @xcite is the use of a lattice fermion formulation that preserves exact chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacings . for both sea and valence quarks we employ the overlap fermion @xcite , which satisfies the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite and thus has a symmetry under a modified chiral transformation @xcite .",
    "this exact chiral symmetry prohibits the operator mixing under the renormalization between @xmath9 and @xmath1 , where the matrix element of the latter operator involves the connected diagram contribution . with the wilson fermion formulation that has been used in the previous works ,",
    "the operator mixing is induced due to the explicit chiral symmetry breaking on the lattice .",
    "since the connected diagram contribution of @xmath1 is larger than the disconnected one by an order of magnitude , this may give rise to a large systematic error unless the mixing contribution is subtracted nonperturbatively .",
    "in our previous work @xcite , we used a technique to extract @xmath11 and @xmath7 from the quark mass dependence of the nucleon mass using the feynman - hellman theorem .",
    "since the number of sea quark mass values in the simulations was limited , the method had an inconsistency that the disconnected contribution was evaluated at up and down quark masses , which are different from the physical strange quark mass . in the present work ,",
    "this limitation no longer remains .",
    "although the calculation is done on two - flavor qcd lattices , which are available from the project of the dynamical overlap fermion by the jlqcd - twqcd collaboration @xcite , an extension to the realistic 2 + 1-flavor qcd is straightforward and in fact underway .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] , our simulation setup and the methods of the all - to - all propagator and the low - mode averaging are described .",

    "when the renormalization scheme respects chiral symmetry , the disconnected diagrams vanish in the massless limit , because the quark loop starting from and ending at a scalar operator @xmath146 has to change the chirality in the loop while the change of chirality does not occur by attaching any number of gluon lines to the quark loop .",
    "it means that @xmath144 is satisfied for mass independent renormalization schemes , as far as they maintain exact chiral symmetry .",
    "this also applies in the case of the overlap fermion formulation on the lattice , as there is an exact chiral symmetry guaranteed by the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite at finite lattice spacings @xcite .",
    "thus , the renormalization of the scalar operator reduces to a multiplicative renormalization @xmath147 with @xmath148 . here",
    "we specify the renormalization point @xmath41 for the renormalized operator @xmath142 .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is nonperturbatively calculated in @xcite as @xmath149 = 1.243(15 ) on our lattice . for the numerical results of @xmath150 ( [ eqn : fts_result ] ) and @xmath49 ( [ eqn : y_result ] ) quoted in the previous section ,",
    "the renormalization factor is unnecessary , because they are related to a renormalization invariant operator @xmath151 or a ratio @xmath152 .",
    "as it is clear from the above discussion , the explicit violation of chiral symmetry with the conventional wilson - type fermions induces a mixing between the strange and @xmath153 quark contents .",
    "in addition , the flavor - singlet scalar operator mixes with an identity operator , so that ( [ eqn : sbars : gen ] ) is modified as @xmath154,\\ ] ] where the term @xmath155 represents the power divergent mixing contribution .",
    "this contribution from the identity operator must be subtracted as a part of the vacuum expectation value of @xmath9 . because of the cubic divergence , this results in a large cancellation toward the continuum limit .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath145 does not vanish when chiral symmetry is violated , @xmath9 mixes with @xmath1 , which induces a connected diagram contribution in the calculation of the three - point function .",
    "since the connected diagram is larger than the disconnected contribution by an order of magnitude , the whole effect from @xmath156 could be substantial , even though the difference @xmath145 may be small .",
    "this possibility has been neglected in most of the previous lattice calculations using the wilson - type fermions .",
    "the strange quark content can also be calculated from the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath6 through the feynman - hellmann theorem @xmath157 we refer to this method as the spectrum method in the following .",
    "exact chiral symmetry plays a crucial role in this method , too . with the explicit chiral symmetry violation",
    ", masses of sea and valence quarks , @xmath158 and @xmath159 ( where @xmath160 distinguishes the quark flavors @xmath153 and @xmath161 ) , depend on the sea strange quark mass @xmath162 .",
    "namely , there is an additive mass renormalization @xmath163 @xmath164 when we relate the bare quark masses on the lattice ( @xmath158 and @xmath159 ) to their counterparts ( @xmath165 and @xmath166 ) defined in some continuum renormalization scheme .",
    "@xmath167 is the multiplicative renormalization factor . with dynamical wilson fermions ,",
    "this additive mass renormalization @xmath163 is of the cutoff order , @xmath168 , and its dependence on the sea quark mass is a quantity of order unity .",
    "then , we can write the relevant partial derivative @xmath169 calculated on the lattice in terms of the `` physical '' quark mass dependence of @xmath6 as @xmath170 ,    \\label{eqn : prtl_drvtv}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the matrix elements appearing on the right - hand side are those with the continuum renormalization scheme . the last term must be subtracted from @xmath171 to obtain the strange quark content .",
    "it requires a calculation of the light quark content @xmath11 , which is dominated by the connected diagram , and of the @xmath162 dependence of @xmath163 , which strongly depends on the details of the lattice action used in the calculation . in the literature , this subtraction was considered only in @xcite , where the subtraction induced a rather large statistical error .",
    "one may avoid this problem by differentiating @xmath6 in terms of pion and kaon mass squared , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , instead of @xmath5 , assuming the gmor relations @xmath174 , @xmath175 . since the quark masses appearing in the right - hand side of the gmor relations contain the additive mass renormalization @xmath163 , the above subtraction is not necessary .",
    "but the method introduces another uncertainty , because the gmor relations are valid only at the leading order of the quark mass , and the higher order terms are not negligible in general .",
    "this method has been applied in the analysis of @xcite .",
    "parameter with previous studies .",
    "the result in this study ( [ eqn : y_result ] ) and our estimate using the spectrum method @xcite are plotted by filled and open circles .",
    "triangles represent previous direct calculations from the nucleon three - point functions @xcite .",
    "squares are the results of @xcite that used the spectrum method .",
    "we plot two results obtained with and without subtracting the contamination due to the chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "( bottom panel )  two recent results @xcite are plotted .",
    "values are converted to the @xmath49 parameter using the quark mass ratio @xmath176  @xcite and the nucleon @xmath12 term @xcite .",
    "the quoted errors are statistical only except for our studies and the two recent calculations @xcite . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ( top panel ) we compare our result ( [ eqn : y_result ] ) for the @xmath49 parameter plotted by a solid circle with those from previous studies using the wilson - type actions @xcite . among these",
    ", @xcite are quenched calculations and @xcite contain the effects of two dynamical flavors . rather large values @xmath49",
    "= 0.40.8 were obtained in the calculations from the nucleon three - point functions @xcite , for which the above mentioned contamination was not taken into account and large systematic error is expected .",
    "an exception is the ukqcd s calculation with the spectrum method @xcite ; the subtraction of the contamination led to a large uncertainty in @xmath49 .    in the same figure",
    ", we also compare our result ( [ eqn : y_result ] ) with our previous estimate @xmath177 from the spectrum method @xcite , where the first and second errors are statistical and systematic , respectively . because of the exact chiral symmetry satisfied in both of our calculations , these two points are free from the contamination and consistent with each other .",
    "recently there have been two calculations published @xcite .",
    "the analysis of young and thomas @xcite fits the data from recent calculations of the baryon spectrum done by the lhpc @xcite and pacs - cs @xcite collaborations , and takes a derivative in terms of @xmath172 and @xmath173 .",
    "as already mentioned , the problem of the operator mixing is avoided in this method and the authors obtained a result consistent with ours .",
    "toussaint and freeman @xcite uses the data for the nucleon mass obtained by the milc collaboration using the so - called `` asqtad '' quark action , which is a variant of the staggered fermion formulation .",
    "they use a clever idea of extracting the derivative of the nucleon correlator in terms of the quark mass from the correlation between the nucleon correlator and the scalar density operator ( the feynman - hellmann theorem ) .",
    "since the staggered fermion has a remnant chiral symmetry , there is no problem with the operator mixing . on the other hand",
    ", there is a subtlety due to the artificial fourth root of the fermion determinant necessary for the staggered fermions , for which the feynman - hellmann theorem is modified .",
    "their result appears to be slightly higher than ours .",
    "in this paper we calculate the nucleon strange quark content on the lattice directly from the nucleon three - point function in two - flavor qcd .",
    "chiral symmetry is exactly preserved by employing the overlap fermion formulation on the lattice .",
    "this is crucial in the calculation of the strange quark content in order to avoid large contaminations from the operator mixing effects , that were missing in many of the previous calculations .",
    "the lattice calculation of the disconnected diagram is technically challenging . in this work we attempted various options of the all - to - all propagator technique and the low - mode averaging together with the source and sink smearings . by optimizing those ,",
    "we could finally obtain the nonzero signal at each quark mass ; the value extrapolated to the physical quark masses is away from zero by 1.5 standard deviation .",
    "the results for @xmath150 and @xmath49 are in good agreement with our previous estimate using the spectrum method @xcite , and favor small strange quark content @xmath178 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than previous lattice calculations without respecting chiral symmetry , which we now believe unreliable .    for more realistic calculations",
    ", we must include the dynamical strange quark in the simulation .",
    "such a calculation is already underway using both the spectrum and direct methods @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to extend this study to other baryon observables involving disconnected quark loops , such as the strange quark spin fraction of the nucleon .",
