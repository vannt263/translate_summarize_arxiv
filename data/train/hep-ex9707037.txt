    "due to the high centre of mass energy @xmath1 and presence of a lepton and quark in the initial state , searches for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) in @xmath0 collisions at hera complement those made at lep and the tevatron .",
    "indeed , much interest has focused on the recent results published by the zeus and h1 experiments  @xcite in which an excess of events above standard model predictions was reported in the previously unexplored region of high @xmath2 .",
    "no attempt will be made in this review , however , to discuss this excess within the context of new physics .",
    "further discussion and the latest results in the high @xmath2 region can be found in the conference proceedings  @xcite .",
    "preliminary results are presented on the search for excited fermions and selectron and squark production within the framework of r - parity conserving supersymmetric models using a total integrated luminosity of 9.3  and 20  respectively .",
    "results on the search for r - parity violating squarks are also discussed taking into account all possible r - parity violating and gauge decays and using an integrated luminosity of 2.83  .",
    "the existence of excited leptons or quarks would provide compelling evidence for a new layer of fermion structure predicted within theories of compositeness . at hera single excited electrons , quarks and neutrinos can in principle be produced with masses up to the kinematic limit of 300 gev via the processes @xmath3 shown in figure  [ fig : fstar_feyn ] .",
    "the resonance is searched for via its electroweak decay to a light fermion , @xmath4 , and a vector boson , @xmath5 .",
    "direct searches for excited leptons and quarks have also been carried out at lep and the tevatron . in @xmath6 collisions ,",
    "excited leptons may be pair or singly produced up to @xmath7 . at 95% confidence level ( cl ) ,",
    "any excited lepton @xmath8 ) with mass below approximately 80 gev has been ruled out  @xcite .",
    "this limit can be extended when the excited fermion is produced singly , however , becomes dependent on the coupling parameters at the @xmath9 vertex as shown in figure  [ fig : fstar ] .",
    "experiments at the tevatron have set stringent limits on the production of @xmath10 in @xmath11 collisions at @xmath12 , excluding @xmath10 produced via the strong coupling  @xcite with masses between 80 and 760  gev , except for a window between 570 and 580  gev .",
    "hera therefore extends the mass range over which @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be searched and offers unique sensitivity for excited quarks produced via electroweak mechanisms .",
    "in describing excited fermion production and decay it has become conventional to use the phenomenological model of hagiwara et al  @xcite , extended to include excited quark production by baur et al  @xcite .",
    "the effective lagrangian describing magnetic transitions from spin @xmath15 excited fermions @xmath16 to ordinary fermions @xmath4 has the form    @xmath17 f + h.c.\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 corresponds to the compositeness scale and the constants @xmath4 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 describe the effective changes from the standard model coupling constants @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "it is conventional to relate these unknown constants according to the chosen decay mode , thereby reducing the cross section dependence to a single parameter , @xmath24 . for excited electron and excited quark searches @xmath25 and @xmath26 is chosen , exploring excited quark production via electroweak mechanisms . the radiative decay of excited neutrinos ( @xmath27 ) is only allowed when @xmath28 and in this case @xmath29 and @xmath30 is chosen .",
    "the zeus search for excited fermions in positron - proton collisions uses an integrated luminosity of 9.4  .",
    "the @xmath16 decay modes which have been studied are shown in figure  [ fig : fstar_feyn ] and the subsequent decay channels of the heavy boson are listed in table  [ table : fstar ] .",
    "a detailed description of the analysis is given in  @xcite .",
    ".[table : fstar ] the decay modes and subsequent final states considered in this search for excited fermions . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     figure  [ fig : estarmass ] shows the mass of the reconstructed @xmath31 final state in events with two isolated , high @xmath32 electromagnetic clusters .",
    "the data are compared to the predicted monte carlo background , comprising mainly qed compton and neutral current dis events .",
    "the unshaded histogram shows the expected lineshape for an excited electron of mass 150 gev .",
    "the cluster of four events at masses around 135 gev have features consistent with background expectations .    in the absence of a positive signal for excited leptons or quarks in any of the eight decay modes considered , upper limits on the characteristic coupling @xmath24 as a function of the excited fermion mass",
    "were determined at 95% confidence level .",
    "figure  [ fig : fstar ] shows the limits for @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath10 production derived from each of the final states considered and from their combination using the assumptions about the couplings discussed previously . in each case",
    "the most stringent limits are derived from the @xmath33 channel and dominate the combined limit from all three decay modes .",
    "the limits on @xmath13 and @xmath14 production from the lep experiments are also shown and demonstrate that hera extends the limits for @xmath16 production well beyond the @xmath34 gev limits currently achieved at lep .",
    "also shown on the @xmath35 plot is the limit from the previous search by zeus in @xmath36 collisions with a much lower integrated luminosity ( 0.55  ) .",
    "this previous limit is more stringent for excited neutrino masses greater than 130 gev because the @xmath35 production cross section in @xmath37 collisions is heavily suppressed relative to @xmath36 collisions , out - weighing the increase in integrated luminosity taken with positrons .",
    "high luminosity running with an @xmath38 beam planned for the 1998 run - period will substantially improve this limit .",
    "exclusion limits on the excited fermion masses can be determined by further assuming that @xmath39 . for this case , at 95% cl , excited electrons are ruled out in the mass range between 30 and 200 gev using the combined limit from all three decay modes .",
    "excited neutrinos with masses in the range 40 to 96 gev are excluded while excited quarks with electroweak - only couplings are excluded over the range 40 to 196 gev .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is presently considered to be a promising candidate for a theory beyond the standard model . while there is strong theoretical motivation for its existence ,",
    "there is currently no experimental evidence to support its prediction that each sm particle has a supersymmetric partner differing by a half - unit of spin .    within the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) it is assumed that r - parity is conserved .",
    "this implies that susy particles can only be produced in pairs and that the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , taken here to be the lightest neutralino  is stable and weakly interacting thereby escaping detection .",
    "existing limits from the lep experiments at @xmath40 exclude selectrons with mass less than @xmath41  80  gev  @xcite and spartners to the light quarks with masses less that 45 gev ( lep1 )  @xcite .",
    "although the experiments at the tevatron set strong limits on squark masses , these are dependent on the gluino mass  @xcite and can only be related to the hera results assuming additional relations motivated by grand unified theories ( gut ) .    at hera",
    "the dominant mssm process is the production of a selectron and squark via @xmath42 channel neutralino exchange @xmath43 as shown in figure  [ fig : mssm_feyn ] .",
    "although the  and   can decay into any lighter gaugino and their sm partners , the cleanest experimental signature involves both the @xmath44 and @xmath45 decays and is the one considered here .",
    "the final state topology consists therefore of an electron which is acoplanar to the hadronic system and missing momentum .",
    "limits from a earlier search using the h1 detector and an integrated luminosity of 6.4  have been published in  @xcite .",
    "the current search by zeus uses an integrated luminosity of 20  .",
    "no signal was observed and preliminary exclusion limits on  production were derived at @xmath46 confidence level .",
    "the limits are interpreted as exclusion regions in mssm parameter space .",
    "the quantities used are @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the mass parameters for the @xmath49 amd @xmath50 gauginos , the higgsino mass parameter @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , the ratio of the two higgs doublet vacuum expectation values .",
    "figure  [ fig : m0mq ] shows the excluded region in the plane defined by the mass of the lightest neutralino and half the sum of the selectron and squark masses for @xmath53 and different values of @xmath51 . for small values of @xmath51 ( @xmath54 ) and low neutralino masses ,",
    "competing decays of the @xmath55 and @xmath56 to gauginos other than the  lead to reduced limits for @xmath57 . in the region @xmath58 ,",
    "the branching ratios @xmath59 and @xmath60 are close to one because the other gauginos are heavier than @xmath61 or @xmath62 . at large @xmath63",
    "the mass difference between the ,  and  becomes small leading to a reduction in cross section together with a drop in detection efficiency limiting the upper exclusion bound .",
    "the excluded mass range extends to 72  gev for @xmath57 and 47  gev for @xmath63 , extending the previous limits set by h1  @xcite with lower luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : memq ] shows the excluded region in @xmath61 versus @xmath62 for different values of fixed  mass at @xmath54 .",
    "the limits are approximately functions of the sum @xmath64 due to the cross section and efficiency depending almost essentially on this sum . for @xmath65 squarks with masses between 55  gev and 89  gev",
    "are excluded for @xmath66 while selectrons with mass between 55  gev and 92  gev are excluded for @xmath67 .",
    "the selectron mass exclusion limits from lep2  @xcite are also indicated in figure  [ fig : memq ] and show that the new hera limits exclude a further region at high selectron and low squark masses .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mum2 ] the exclusion limits on @xmath47 versus @xmath51 are shown for @xmath53 and @xmath68 , a good approximatation for the only susy gut relation used here @xmath69 . for @xmath70 , the  is dominated by its photino component leading to couplings to the selectron and squark that are electromagnetic in strength and allow for a sizable cross section .",
    "as @xmath71 the  becomes higgsino - like and the couplings and cross section become very small .",
    "the zeus limits are compared to those from chargino and neutralino searches at lep  @xcite and extend considerably the limits on @xmath47 at negative @xmath51 .",
    "the search for r - parity violating squarks possessing a yukawa coupling @xmath72 to lepton - quark pairs is particularly promising at hera .",
    "such squarks can be singly produced as an @xmath73 channel resonance up to the kinematic limit of @xmath74 via positron - quark fusion .",
    "the squarks subsequently decay via their yukawa coupling into fermions or via their gauge couplings into a quark and neutralino or a chargino as shown in figures  [ fig : rparity_feyn](a ) , ( c ) and ( b ) , ( d ) respectively . the @xmath75 and @xmath76 are mixed states of the supersymmetric partners to the sm gauge bosons and neutral higgses and are in general unstable .",
    "in contrast to the mssm , this also holds for the lsp which can decay into a quark , antiquark and lepton .    in the case",
    "where both the squark production and decay occur through a yukawa  coupling indices correspond to to the generations of superfields @xmath77 and @xmath78 containing the left - handed lepton doublet and quark doublet , and the right - handed quark singlet respectively ] the final state signatures consist of a lepton and jet and are indistinguishable from standard neutral and charged current deep inelastic scattering on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the strategy then involves searching for a resonance at high mass ( @xmath79 ) where @xmath80 is the bjorken scaling variable .",
    "no attempt is made here to interpret the recently reported excess of events at high @xmath80 and @xmath2 observed at the hera experiments  @xcite within the context of r - parity violating susy .    using an integrated luminosity of 2.8  the squark mass",
    "is reconstructed using the @xmath81 energy and polar angle in the selected neutral current sample and the hadronic final state in the charge current sample .",
    "figures  [ fig : h1_squark](a ) and ( b ) show the reconstructed mass for the neutral and charged current event samples respectively .",
    "the shaded histogram indicates the background monte carlo while the dashed histogram compares the mass distribution for a mixture of background and susy mc events for @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively .",
    "no significant deviation from the number of expected events is observed when including all sources of systematic error .",
    "squark decays via gauge couplings @xmath84 or @xmath85 and @xmath86 have also been considered ( figure  [ fig : rparity_feyn ]  ( b ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "furthermore , both gauge and r - parity violating decays of the chargino have been taken into account together with the dependence of the  decay on its gaugino - higgsino composition governed by the fundamental susy parameters .",
    "in particular if the  is dominated by its photino component it will tend to decay @xmath87 , giving the possibility of a `` wrong sign '' lepton ( with respect to the charge of the incoming lepton beam ) in the final state .        ' '' ''",
