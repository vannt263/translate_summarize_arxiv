    "zigzag graphene ribbon has attracted enormous attention due to its potential application in nanoscale spintronics devices.@xcite it has zero - energy localized states at fermi level , while those with armchair edges have no such peculiar states @xcite .    due to the edge states in zigzag graphene ribbon , the magnetic property of the anderson impurities",
    "would be greatly modified and shows novel behavior differing from that in bulk graphene and in normal metals .",
    "when two magnetic impurities are located sufficiently far away from each other , they can be modeled by a single impurity hamiltonian@xcite .",
    "however , if they are close together , the `` spin compensation clouds '' of surrounding conduction electrons will overlap , and interesting effects show up due to the indirect ruderman - kitter - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) coupling @xcite between magnetic impurities , which is mediated by the conduction electrons .    in the bipartite lattice , the oscillatory rkky interaction becomes commensurate and the effective exchange coupling is always ferromagnetic ( fm ) for the same sublattice but antiferromagnetic ( afm ) for opposite sublattice at the fermi level@xcite .",
    "rkky interaction on the graphene and graphenelike systems at half - filling has been constantly studied@xcite , and the rkky coupling on zigzag edge is reported to decay exponentially due to the localized zero - energy states @xcite , while in graphene the coupling is proportional to @xmath1.@xcite    in this paper , we use the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method based on the hirsch - fye algorithm @xcite to study the indirect coupling between magnetic adatoms placed on the zigzag graphene edge .",
    "we calculate various thermodynamic quantities with respect to the chemical potential , since graphene is a system whose carrier density can be tuned by the electric field effect@xcite . for @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the kondo temperature and d is the band width ,",
    "the spin - spin correlation between the two magnetic impurities are expected to be @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the spin on the i - th impurity and @xmath6 is the inverse temperature",
    ". therefore our study on the spin - spin correlation between magnetic impurities can provide insights into the behavior of the rkky interactions while @xmath7 .",
    "as a function of @xmath0 . ( a ) two impurities both located on the edge sites belong to sublattice a , ( b ) two impurities on different sublattices . @xmath8 denotes the configuration that two impurities are located on @xmath9 and @xmath10 sites .",
    "here we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , ( c ) the schematic structure of zigzag chain .",
    "one adatom is fixed on the red circled site @xmath9 and the other one is moved along the zigzag chain . ]    in our study , we choose zigzag edged ribbon with @xmath15 zigzag chains , where the density of states on the edge is comparable to the van hove singularity at @xmath16 in bulk graphene@xcite .",
    "we fix the location of one impurity and change the location of the other impurity along the zigzag chain to study the behavior of the indirect interactions . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgnrmd2 ] are the values of magnet moment squared , which is defined as @xmath17 with @xmath18 being the carrier density on the impurity site and @xmath19 being the spin index .",
    "when the two impurities are both located on the edge sites belonging to sublattice a , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgnrmd2 ] ( a ) , the local moment is strongly suppressed near the zero energy . due to the indirect exchange between impurities , when two impurities are located on @xmath9 and @xmath10 sites , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgnrmd2 ] ( c ) , the values of local moment is less suppressed . as the displacement between the two impurities",
    "is increased , the effect of indirect coupling decreases such that the local moment is more strongly quenched .",
    "the results for two impurities located on two different sublattices are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgnrmd2 ] ( b ) .",
    "the effect of the indirect coupling is much weaker than the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgnrmd2 ] ( a ) , and we can observe that the local moment on the a sites are not affected by the rkky interaction , while that on the b site is slightly suppressed near the zero energy .",
    "the results for site configurations with larger distance are not shown because the effect of the indirect coupling decays so fast that the results would be mostly the same .    .",
    "one impurity fixed on the site @xmath9 , the other impurity locatedon the site @xmath10 ( a ) , and @xmath20 ( b ) , respectively .",
    "here we use @xmath13 and @xmath14 . ]    shown in fig.[fig : zgnrss ] are the spin - spin correlation between two magnetic impurities with one impurity fixed on the site @xmath9 and the other impurity located on the site @xmath10 , @xmath20 , respectively . various values of parameters as @xmath21 and @xmath22 are tested for @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in fig.[fig : zgnrss ] ( a ) , we can find that when @xmath23 , the spin - spin correlation is ferromagnetic , which is consistent with the results of the rkky interaction in the bipartite lattice@xcite for the undoped case .",
    "as @xmath0 is lowered from zero - energy , the fm spin - spin correlation is first decreased and then at approximately at @xmath24 , it vanishes for all the parameters we examined . if we continue to decrease the chemical potential , the fm correlation turns to amf and the magnitude grows as @xmath0 is decreased further .",
    "hence , we can observe a transition from fm to afm correlation , and the afm correlation becomes stronger when we switch down the chemical potential .",
    "the afm correlation is the strongest at @xmath25 , and the decrease in the value of @xmath0 will lead to decrease of the strength of afm correlation .",
    "finally at @xmath26 , afm correlation vanishes .",
    "near the zero - energy , the spin - spin correlations for @xmath11 and @xmath27 is more strongly quenched compared with the case @xmath11 and @xmath12 . as the hybridization @xmath28 increases , the screening effect of the conduction electron would be enhanced , which will lead to much stronger suppression on the local moment formation . on the other hand , for the same values of hybridization @xmath12 ,",
    "the spin - spin correlation for @xmath29 is larger than that of @xmath11 , because larger repulsive @xmath30 would give rise to single occupation on the impurity site .    if the second impurity is located on the site @xmath20 , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgnrss](b ) , the spin - spin correlation at undoped ribbon is antiferromagnetic .",
    "however , as we switch @xmath0 below the zero - energy , the afm correlation is enhanced , and it has a maximum magnitude at @xmath31 . if we further decrease the chemical potential , the afm correlation is decreased either , and finally at @xmath32 , it vanishes and the rkky coupling changes to a fm one .     and @xmath10 .",
    "here we use @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . ]",
    "the qmc method naturally returns the imaginary time green s functions of the impurity sites , by which we can simply obtain the correlation functions such as @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the two impurity sites have @xmath37 different spin configurations , and the sum of the weight of all these configurations is defined to be unity .",
    "all of the configurations would contribute to the spin - spin correlation , but our simulation reveals that the configurations @xmath38 and @xmath39 are dominant near the zero - energy .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgnrweight ] , we show the weight of different components of the d - electron wave function . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgnrweight ] ( a ) , the weight of @xmath39 type dominates when @xmath23 . as the chemical potential is lowered , we find that the weight of @xmath39 type decreases and that of @xmath38 is largely enhanced . if we further lower the chemical potential , the contribution from the @xmath40 and the vacuum states increases due to the decrease in charge density . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zgnrweight ] ( b ) , we notice the similar behavior .",
    "as @xmath0 is lowered , the weight of the @xmath39 type wave function is drastically enhanced , while those of the @xmath38 is decreased , and the two curves cross over each other at @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the studies on the weight of different components of the wave function are in agreement with those of spin - spin correlations .",
    "as we switch down the chemical potential , parallel spin configuration becomes more and more favored by the two impurities .",
    "as @xmath0 is further lowered , the charges move out from the impurity such that the wave functions for the single occupancy and vacuum states dominate and hence , the afm correlation is gradually decreased .",
