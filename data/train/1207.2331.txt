    "small - angle neutron scattering ( sans ) is one of the most important techniques for microstructure determination in soft and hard condensed matter , materials science , and in physical chemistry . since most sans studies focus on nuclear rather than magnetic scattering , it is not surprising that the theoretical concepts behind nuclear sans are rather well developped @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the understanding of magnetic sans is still at its beginning , although magnetic sans has previously demonstrated great potential for resolving the spin structures of various magnetic materials . for instance",
    "( in the last decade ) , magnetic sans has been employed for studying the microstructures of magnetic nanocomposites @xcite , amorphous alloys @xcite , and of elemental nanocrystalline bulk ferromagnets @xcite , the process of dynamic nuclear polarization @xcite , imaging of the flux - line lattice in superconductors @xcite , precipitates in steels @xcite , nanocrystalline rare - earth metals with random paramagnetic susceptibility @xcite , fractal magnetic domain structures in ndfeb permanent magnets @xcite , spin structures of ferrofluids , nanoparticles , and nanowires @xcite , magnetostriction in fega alloys @xcite , electric - field - induced magnetization in multiferroics @xcite , magnetization reversal in magnetic recording media @xcite and exchange - bias materials @xcite , and chiral and skyrmion - like structures in single crystals @xcite .",
    "necessary prerequisite for the quantitative analysis of elastic magnetic sans data is the knowledge of the fourier components of the static magnetization vector field @xmath0 of the sample under study .",
    "the theory of micromagnetics @xcite provides the proper framework for the computation of @xmath0 .",
    "however , the solution of brown s equations of micromagnetics amounts to the solution of a set of nonlinear partial differential equations with complex boundary conditions , a task which can not be done analytically for most practically relevant problems . therefore",
    ", closed - form expressions for the ensuing so - called spin - misalignment scattering cross section are limited to the approach - to - saturation regime @xcite , in which the micromagnetic equations can be linearized .",
    "in this review article we summarize our recent work , in which we have used _ numerical _ micromagnetics for the computation of the magnetic sans cross section of two - phase magnetic nanocomposites .",
    "the use of numerical techniques allows us to solve the underlying equations rigorously , without resorting to the high - field approximation ( saturation regime ) .",
    "this approach provides insights into the fundamentals of magnetic sans .",
    "the micromagnetic simulations are adapted to the microstructure of a two - phase nanocomposite from the nanoperm family of alloys @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "2 we provide the details of our micromagnetic methodology , sec .  3 discusses the magnetic sans cross sections for the two most commonly used scattering geometries , sec .  4 presents and discusses the results of the micromagnetic simulations for the magnetic sans cross section , and in sec .",
    "5 we summarize the main findings of this study .",
    "micromagnetism is a mesoscopic phenomenological theory designed to compute the equilibrium magnetization state of an arbitrarily shaped ferromagnetic body , when the applied field , the geometry of the ferromagnet and all materials parameters are known @xcite . in order to find the equilibrium magnetization configuration @xmath1 ,",
    "the total magnetic free energy of a ferromagnet should be considered as a functional of its magnetization state , @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "the state which delivers a ( local ) minimum to this functional corresponds to the required equilibrium magnetization configuration , so that the problem amounts to the minimization of the total energy functional . in the most common case",
    "@xmath3 contains contributions from the energy due to an external field , exchange , anisotropy and magnetodipolar interaction energies . due to the nonlocal nature of the magnetodipolar interaction , almost all practically interesting problems",
    "can not be treated analytically , so that numerical minimization of @xmath4 $ ] should be carried out . in the contemporary research landscape ,",
    "numerical micromagnetics is a large and still continuously expanding field .",
    "recent reviews on the micromagnetic state of the art can be found in the handbook ref .",
    "@xcite . in this article",
    "we briefly discuss only those methodical aspects of numerical micromagnetics which are important for simulations of nanocomposite materials .",
    "first , we would like to emphasize that such materials are one of the most complicated objects from the point of view of numerical simulations .",
    "the main difficulty is that they consist of at least two phases , and the boundaries between these phases are complicated curved surfaces ; a typical example is a hard - soft nanocomposite consisting of magnetically hard ( i.e. , having a large magnetocystalline anisotropy ) crystal grains surrounded by a magnetically soft matrix .",
    "such a system is very difficult to simulate for the following reasons .",
    "the majority of modern numerical micromagnetic methods can be subdivided into two classes , the so - called finite - difference and finite - element methods ( fdm and fem ) @xcite . in fdm",
    "the system under study is discretized into a regular translationally invariant ( usually rectangular ) grid .",
    "such a discretization allows , first , the evaluation of the exchange field by simple finite - difference formulas , which are the finite - difference approximations for the corresponding second - order differential operator acting on the magnetization field @xmath0 ( see below ) .",
    "second , the translational invariance of a fdm grid enables the usage of the fast fourier transformation ( fft ) technique for the computation of the long - range magnetodipolar interaction field and energy . for a system discretized into @xmath5 cells ,",
    "the fft technique reduces the operation count for this energy from @xmath6 ( for a direct summation ) to @xmath7 .",
    "however , a serious disadvantage of a regular grid is a pure approximation for arbitrarily curved surfaces and boundaries .",
    "this is an important drawback for simulations of magnetic nanocomposites , because the adequate representation of the interphase boundaries for the accurate evaluation of associated exchange and magnetodipolar interactions between different phases is crucially important .",
    "the second group of numerical methods widely used in micromagnetics  finite - element methods ( fem)employ the discretization of the system under study into arbitrarily shaped tetrahedrons .",
    "the flexibility of this discretization type allows one to represent curved boundaries ( including those between magnetically hard inclusions and the soft magnetic matrix ) with any desired accuracy .",
    "however , the price to pay for this flexibility is high .",
    "first , computation of the exchange field requires now complicated methods designed for the accurate representation of second - order differential operators on irregular lattices .",
    "second ( and most important ) , it is no longer possible to use fft for the magnetodipolar field evaluation . for this reason",
    ", highly sophisticated methods for the computation of this field are used in fem simulations .",
    "these methods , which are based on the decomposition of magnetic potentials inside the ferromagnet and in the outer space , and the subsequent solution of the corresponding poisson equations for these potentials on irregular grids @xcite require a high programming effort and result in _ iterative _ algorithms for the evaluation of the dipolar field for a given magnetization configuration ( in contrast to the fft technique ) .",
    "another important limitation of finite - element methods is that they can only be employed in simulations with _",
    "open _ boundary conditions ( obc ) , so that _ periodic _ boundary conditions ( or pbc , routinely applied in simulations of extended thin films and bulk materials in order to eliminate strong finite - size effects ) can not be used .",
    "the impossibility to apply pbc is a serious disadvantage in simulations of sans experiments on nanocomposites , whereby the scattering intensity is sensitive to magnetization fluctuations in the bulk .",
    "artificial surface demagnetizing effects arising in simulations with obc might be very significant in this case , due to a relatively small simulation volume affordable even for modern computers .",
    "in addition , the suppression of these effects is especially important for nanocomposites containing a soft magnetic phase .",
    "another undesirable feature of a tetrahedron mesh is that hard magnetic grains must also be discretized into tetrahedrons , although in many cases the magnetization within a single grain is nearly homogeneous .",
    "this leads to a significant increase of the total number of finite elements required , resulting in a corresponding increase of the computation time ; we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for the discussion of this problem .    due to all the reasons explained above",
    ", numerical micromagnetic simulations of sans experiments on nanocomposites are very rare @xcite .",
    "corresponding full - scale simulations of sans measurements on a two - phase system have been reported , up to our knowledge , only in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the magnetization configuration of a longitudinal magnetic recording media film was modeled . based on the experimental characterization of this material ,",
    "the authors of @xcite have built a two - phase model for this system , where each magnetic grain consisted of a hard magnetic grain core and an essentially paramagnetic grain shell , having a very high susceptibility .",
    "the oommf code employing the standard fdm has been used @xcite , so that a very fine discretization ( @xmath8 cells ) had to be applied in order to reproduce the spherical shape of grain cores with a required accuracy .",
    "for this reason , only a rather limited number of grains ( @xmath9 ) could be simulated .",
    "in addition , the exchange interaction both between the grains and within the soft magnetic matrix ( represented by the merging grain shells ) was neglected . still , using several adjustable parameters , a satisfactory agreement of the simulated sans intensity profile with experimental data",
    "was achieved .",
    "the brief overview of the methodical problems presented here clearly shows that both a qualitative improvement of the micromagnetic simulation methodology and extensive numerical studies devoted to sans experiments are highly desirable .",
    "for the reasons explained in the previous section and in order to perform accurate and efficient simulations of two - phase nanocomposites , we need to generate a polyhedron mesh with the following properties : ( a ) it should allow to represent each hard magnetic crystallite as a single finite element ( because the magnetization inside such a crystallite is essentially homogeneous ) , ( b ) the mesh should allow for an arbitrarily fine discretization of the soft magnetic matrix in - between the hard grains ( to account for the possible large variations of the magnetization direction between the hard grains ) , and ( c ) the shape of the meshing polyhedrons should be as close as possible to spherical , in order to ensure a good quality of a spherical dipolar approximation for the calculation of the magnetodipolar interaction energy , even for the nearest neighboring mesh elements .    a mesh consisting of polyhedrons satisfying all these requirements",
    "can be generated using two kinds of methods .",
    "first , there exist various modifications of a purely geometrical algorithm designed to obtain a random close packing of hard spheres @xcite . in these algorithms ,",
    "the initial distribution of sphere centers is completely random .",
    "then , at each step the worst overlap between two spheres is eliminated by pushing these spheres apart along the line connecting their centers .",
    "this procedure usually introduces new overlaps ; however , these overlaps are usually smaller and are eliminated during the next steps , so that on the average the packing quality improves ( the largest overlap present in the system decreases ) .",
    "the algorithm is robust and produces a random close packing of nonoverlapping spheres with any desired accuracy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "unfortunately , the computation time for this method increases with the number of elements @xmath5 as @xmath6 , so that the maximal number of spheres which can be positioned within a reasonable computation time is @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , in order to generate a mesh with a much larger number of finite elements ( @xmath11 ) , we have developed a `` physical '' method , where we model a system of spheres interacting via a short - range repulsive potential : @xmath12 here , the constant @xmath13 determines the value of our potential when the distance @xmath14 between the centers of interacting spheres is equal to the sum of their radii @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( to ensure small overlaps in the final configuration , it should be @xmath17 ; in a typical case @xmath18 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath19 defines the decay radius of the potential .",
    "again , at the beginning of iterations , sphere centers are positioned randomly .",
    "then , we move the spheres according to the purely dissipative ( i.e. , neglecting the inertial term ) equation of motion resulting from the forces obtained from the potential eq .",
    "( [ repulsivepotential ] ) .",
    "the time step for the integration of this equation is adjusted to ensure decrease of the total system energy after each step .",
    "due to the repulsive nature of the potential eq .",
    "( [ repulsivepotential ] ) , this procedure leads also to the decrease of overlaps of the spheres . to achieve the desired result ,",
    "we move the spheres until their maximum overlap does not exceed some prescribed small value ( we have found that for our purposes the remaining overlap @xmath20 is good enough ) . the algorithm may be refined further to increase its efficiency ; in particular , one might decrease the decay radius of the potential @xmath19 , thus making the potential `` harder '' , when the overlapping between spheres decreases during the sphere motion .",
    "we also note that due to the random spatial arrangement of spheres obtained in this way , we avoid possible artifacts caused by the regular placement of finite elements .",
    "after the spheres have been positioned using one of the two algorithms described above , their centers are used as location points of magnetic dipoles . to compute the magnitudes @xmath21 of these dipoles",
    ", we have to determine the volume of each corresponding mesh element , which is in fact a polyhedron .",
    "this determination is made via a regular grid representation procedure that should satisfy the following requirements .",
    "first , we should conserve the total sample volume .",
    "second , the interface between neighboring mesh elements should be flat as far as possible ( apart from geometrical reasons ) . the last requirement is also supported by electron microscopy images of various polycrystalline magnets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to satisfy both these requirements ,",
    "we used the following method : the sample is divided into cubical cells which side is much smaller ( usually about four times smaller ) than the size of a finite element ( polyhedron ) of our disordered mesh used to discretize the soft phase . for every cubical cell @xmath22 , we calculate the distances @xmath23 between the center of this cell and the centers of neighboring polyhedrons ( labeled by @xmath24 ) . the function @xmath25\\ ] ] indicates to which polyhedron ( with radius @xmath26 ) we attribute the current @xmath22 cube .",
    "the sum of cube volumes ascribed to the given polyhedron is taken as its volume .",
    "as a result of this procedure , the distribution of mesh - element volumes for both magnetic phases demonstrates a nearly gaussian behavior . to obtain the magnitude of the dipolar moment assigned to each polyhedron",
    ", its volume is multiplied by the saturation magnetization of the material inside which the polyhedron is located ( we remind that nanocomposites consist of materials with different magnetizations ) .",
    "this method also allows for a very efficient calculation of the fourier components of the magnetization ( see eqs .  ( [ sigmasansperp ] ) and ( [ sigmasanspara ] ) below ) for a disordered system , using fft on the already composed regular grid .",
    "summarizing , the whole algorithm can be viewed as a method to discretize a sample into polyhedrons having nearly spherical shape ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that polyhedrons `` inherit '' the spatial structure obtained by the positioning of closely packed spheres .",
    "the fact that the shape of the volume which is occupied by each magnetic moment is nearly spherical allows us to use the spherical dipolar approximation ( equivalent to the point dipole approximation ) for the evaluation of the magnetodipolar interaction between the moments .",
    "finally , we point out that both algorithms allow for the usage of polyhedrons with different sizes , if we need different meshing on different system locations .      in our micromagnetic simulations we take into account all four standard contributions to the total magnetic free energy listed above : energy in the external magnetic field , energy of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy , exchange stiffness and magnetodipolar interaction energies .",
    "the system energy due to the presence of an external magnetic field and the energy of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ( which can be uniaxial and/or cubic ) are calculated in our model in the standard way , namely @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the external field , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the magnetic moment and the volume of the @xmath24th finite element ( polyhedron ) , and @xmath33 denotes the unit magnetization vector .",
    "both the anisotropy constants @xmath34 and the directions of the anisotropy axes @xmath35 can be site - dependent , as required for a polycrystalline nanocomposite material . for the cubic anisotropy case , the symbols @xmath36 etc .",
    "represent the components of unit magnetization vectors in the local coordinate system that is attached to the cubic anisotropy axes .",
    "the evaluation of this energy contribution in our model requires a much more sophisiticated approach than in the standard fdm , because the continuous integral version of this energy contains the magnetization gradients , @xmath37 \\ , dv , \\ ] ] where @xmath38 denotes the exchange - stiffness parameter and @xmath39 is the sample volume .",
    "finding an approximation to eq .",
    "( [ intexenergy ] ) for a disordered system is a highly nontrivial task .",
    "we remind that for a regular cubic grid with a cell size @xmath40 ( and cell volume @xmath41 ) , it can be shown rigorously ( see the detailed proof in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the integral in eq .",
    "( [ intexenergy ] ) can be approximated as the sum @xmath42 here , @xmath43 denotes the exchange - stiffness constant between cells @xmath24 and @xmath44 , and the notation @xmath45 means that the inner summation is performed over the nearest neighbors of the @xmath24th cell only .",
    "we note in passing that this heisenberg - like expression is valid only when the angles between neighboring moments are not too large ; as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , neglecting this condition can lead to completely unphysical results .    for a disordered system of finite elements having different volumes , different distances between the element centers , and different numbers of nearest neighbors for each element , the expression eq .",
    "( [ regexenergy ] ) obviously can not be used . the most straightforward way to compute the exchange interaction in such",
    "a system would be to employ a rigorous numerical approximation suitable for the evaluation of the integral eq .",
    "( [ intexenergy ] ) , where the integrand values ( magnetization vectors @xmath46 ) are given at arbitrarily placed spatial points .",
    "derivation of such integration formulas amounts to the approximation of the magnetization projections @xmath47 using some kind of a polynomial interpolation of these functions between the points where their values are defined ( in our case , polyhedron centers ) .",
    "the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ intexenergy ] ) includes first spatial derivatives of the magnetization field , so that corresponding polynomials for the energy evaluation should deliver a continuous ( and even better smooth ) first derivative of @xmath48 . for the effective field evaluation , where the continuous expression involves second - order derivatives ,",
    "the polynomial interpolation is even more demanding .",
    "in addition , we should keep in mind that the condition @xmath49 must be fulfilled everywhere , so that the interpolation of the magnetization angles , rather than that of cartesian magnetization components should be used .",
    "all these features would result in a highly complicated algorithm for the exchange energy and field evaluation , which might be , in addition , subject to serious stability problems to usage of the angle interpolation .    for these reasons",
    ", we have decided to develop an algorithm for the exchange - energy evaluation based on the summation of the nearest neighbors contributions [ similar to the expression ( eq .  [ regexenergy ] ) ] and at the same time take into account the differences between a regular grid and a disordered system mentioned above . to achieve this goal",
    ", we modify the expression eq .",
    "( [ regexenergy ] ) in the following way .",
    "first , from the derivation of the expression eq .",
    "( [ regexenergy ] ) presented in @xcite , it is clear that for the regular mesh consisting of cubic cells , the volume @xmath50 in the numerator of this expression is actually not the volume of the cell , but the volume enclosed between the centers of the cell @xmath24 and the neighboring cell @xmath44 ( for a cubic lattice or a lattice consisting of rectangular prisms , this volume is obviously equal to the cell volume , because it includes two halves of identical cells ) .",
    "therefore , for a disordered system of arbitrary finite elements , @xmath50 should be replaced by @xmath51 , where @xmath32 and @xmath52 are the volumes of the @xmath24th and the @xmath44th finite elements .",
    "the second adjustment of eq .",
    "( [ regexenergy ] ) to a finite element system is the replacement of the distance @xmath40 between the cell centers in a regular lattice by the distance @xmath53 between the centers of cells @xmath24 and @xmath44 .",
    "the third and most complicated correction is due to the different number of nearest neighbors in a regular lattice and in a disordered system of finite elements . in a regular cartesian lattice",
    ", each cell has exactly @xmath54 nearest neighbors , and the angles between the lines connecting the cell center with the centers of its neighbors in @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 directions are always @xmath58 .",
    "for this reason , the overlapping of volumes enclosed between the centers of neighboring cells in , e.g. , @xmath55 and @xmath56 directions is the same for all cells , what was taken into account by derivation of eq .",
    "( [ regexenergy ] ) ( it is important to note , that this overlapping should not be confused with the overlapping of spheres mentioned in the discussion of algorithms used to contruct our disordered mesh in sec .  [ meshgen ] ) .",
    "in contrast to this nice feature of a regular cartesian lattice , in a disordered system of finite elements the number of nearest neighbors for different finite elements may be different , and the overlapping of volumes enclosed between the centers of a given cell and its different neighbors may also vary .",
    "for example , for the element with more than six nearest neighbors , the volumes enclosed between its center and centers of its neighbors would overlap more than for a cubic lattice .",
    "for such an element , the exchange - stiffness energy evaluated using the sum eq .",
    "( [ regexenergy ] ) would be overestimated due to this excessive overlapping , even when the two corrections explained above would be taken into account .",
    "the simplest method to solve this problem is the introduction of the correction factor @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the _ average _ number of nearest neighbors for the particular random realization of our disordered finite - element system .",
    "this correction would compensate on average the effect of the incorrect count of overlapping regions explained above .",
    "the accuracy of this simple correction method can be hardly estimated in advance , but both simple tests performed in @xcite and additional much more complicated tests discussed in sec .  [ minprocedure ] below show that the accuracy provided by this correction method is surprisingly good .    summarizing , for magnetic moments belonging to the same phase we propose the following expression for the exchange - stiffness energy : @xmath61 where @xmath51 , @xmath53 is the distance between the centers of the @xmath24th and the @xmath44th finite elements with volumes @xmath32 and @xmath52 , and @xmath43 is the exchange constant .",
    "the last point to be discussed is the choice of nearest neighbors , which should be used in the inner summation in eq .",
    "( [ exonephaseenergy ] ) .",
    "the choice whether two elements should be considered as nearest neighbors is not unambiguous in disordered systems .",
    "we have adopted the following convention : two magnetic moments are considered as nearest neighbors , if the distance between the centers of corresponding polyhedrons is not larger than @xmath62 .",
    "the cut - off factor @xmath63 is chosen so that for the overwhelming majority of finite elements those two of them which have a common face are treated as nearest neighbors .",
    "to evaluate the exchange - interaction energy between two finite elements ( polyhedrons ) belonging to _ different _ phases ( hard and soft ) , we use the formula : @xmath64 here , @xmath65 is the volume of a soft - phase element and @xmath66 is the radius of the sphere corresponding to the hard phase polyhedron . this modified expression eq .",
    "( [ extwophaseenergy ] ) accounts for the fact that in this case the magnetization rotation occurs almost entirely within the polyhedron corresponding to the soft phase .",
    "the energy of the long - range magnetodipolar interaction between magnetic moments and the corresponding contribution to the total effective field are computed using the point - dipole approximation as @xmath67 i.e. , magnetic moments of finite elements are treated as point dipoles located at the polyhedron centers .",
    "this approximation is equivalent to the approximation of spherical dipoles , i.e. , it would be exact for spherical finite elements .",
    "hence , for our discretized system , this approximation introduces some computational errors , because our finite elements are polyhedrons .",
    "however , these errors are small , because the shape of these polyhedrons is close to spherical ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , due to the special algorithm employed for the generation of our mesh , as explained in sec .",
    "[ meshgen ] .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ dipenergy ] ) is performed by the so called particle - mesh ewald method .",
    "didactically very instructive and detailed introduction into ewald methods can be found in ref .",
    "the specific implementation of the lattice - based ewald method for the magnetodipolar interaction for regular and disordered systems of magnetic particles is described in our papers @xcite . here",
    ", we briefly repeat the basic issues of this algorithm to make our paper self - containing .",
    "first we remind that the ewald method @xcite was initially invented for evaluating conditionally converging lattice sums for the coulomb interaction in ionic crystals . at present , it is a standard method to calculate any long - range interaction  including coulomb sums , gravitation energy , dipole interaction , elastic forces in dislocation networks etc.in systems with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) . in such systems",
    "direct summation over all field sources is impossible simply due to their infinite number .",
    "hence , we must use a fourier expansion over the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath68 which correspond to the infinitely repeated simulation volume .",
    "for the _ point _ sources of the _ long - range _ field , the corresponding fourier components decay relatively slowly with increasing magnitude of the wave vector @xmath69 in reciprocal space . in numerical simulations",
    "we always have to our disposal only a finite number of such wave vectors , so that the fourier spectrum of our long - range interaction should be cut off at the maximal finite value @xmath70 . as mentioned above ,",
    "the fourier harmonics decay slowly , so that at @xmath70 they are by no means small . for this reason , the spectrum cut - off due to the elimination of all fourier components with @xmath71 is sharp , thus , leading to large artificial oscillations of the interaction potential after its inverse transformation to the real space .",
    "as with nearly all ewald methods , the version described below for dipolar systems solves the problem by adding and subtracting a gaussian dipole at each location of a point dipole @xmath72 in the initial system . using the definition of the gradient of the @xmath73 function , it is easy to show that this operation corresponds to the addition and subtraction of a charge distribution ( with a width @xmath74 ) @xmath75    then the magnetodipolar field @xmath76 is evaluated as the sum of two contributions from subsystems a and b. the first subsystem consists of gaussian dipoles eq .",

    "dipoles is the following .",
    "the field eq .",
    "( [ halpha ] ) from the second subsystem b is a _ short - range _ one , because each point dipole is screened by a gaussian dipole with the same total moment , but with the opposite sign .",
    "the computation of such a short - range contribution takes @xmath84 operations for a system of @xmath5 particles . the first subsystem a consists of dipoles having a smooth gaussian charge distribution , so that its fourier components decay rapidly with increasing @xmath69 .",
    "this fast decay allows a painless cut - off of the fourier spectrum at large wave vectors , so that the contribution from the first subsystem eq .",
    "( [ charge_distrib ] ) can be safely calculated using fourier expansion .",
    "more detailed explanations concerning this procedure can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "already the above most straightforward implementation of the ewald method allows for a reliable evaluation of the dipolar field in systems with pbc .",
    "however , for disordered systems , this method has the same prohibitively high operation count @xmath6 , as a direct summation for systems with obc .",
    "the reason is that particle positions in disordered systems do not form a regular lattice , so that the fourier transformation for the calculation of the long - range contribution @xmath85 can not be done via the _ fast _ fourier transformation technique : exponential factors @xmath86 should be computed for all wave vectors @xmath68 and all particle positions @xmath78 separately , leading to the operation count given above .    in order to decrease the computational costs , several lattice versions of the ewald method",
    "have been developed ( see the overview @xcite ) .",
    "the general idea behind all these methods is to employ some mapping of the initial disordered system onto a regular lattice , in order to enable the application of the fft . using this general paradigm ,",
    "we have implemented the following algorithm :    @xmath87 first , we map our disordered system of point magnetic dipoles @xmath31 onto a system of dipoles located at lattice points @xmath88 ( @xmath89 is the 3d index ) using some weighting function @xmath90 , @xmath91 we emphasize that the whole method makes only sense if the mapping function @xmath92 is strongly localized , so that the sum over all @xmath5 dipoles in eq .",
    "( [ w3d ] ) is actually restricted to a few nearest neighbors @xmath93 of the lattice node @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath94 next , we add and subtract to each point _ lattice _ dipole two gaussian dipoles eq .",
    "( [ gauss_dipoles ] ) , as in the straightforward ewald method described above .",
    "@xmath95 further , we compute the dipolar field of this lattice system as described above , i.e. , as the sum of the long - range contribution from smooth gaussian dipoles positioned _ on the lattice _ and the short - range contribution eq .",
    "( [ halpha ] ) from the composite objects `` point dipole @xmath96 gaussian dipole '' , also placed on the lattice .",
    "@xmath97 finally , the field obtained in this way on the _ lattice _",
    "points @xmath88 is mapped back onto the initial dipole locations @xmath78 using the same functions @xmath92 as in eq .",
    "( [ w3d ] ) .    as mentioned above",
    ", the major advantage of this lattice ewald version is the possibility to use fft for computing the long - range part of the total magnetodipolar field .",
    "in addition , we can also accelerate the evalutaion of the short - range contribution .",
    "namely , we note that @xmath98 the contribution eq .",
