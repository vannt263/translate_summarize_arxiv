    "the concept of copulas was introduced by sklar in 1959 @xcite to study the linkage between multivariate distribution functions and their univariate marginals . since then",
    ", copulas have gained growing importance as a tool for modeling statistical dependence of random variables in many fields . in finance ,",
    "the usage of copulas is relatively new but it has already found application in risk management , see e.g. , @xcite , derivative pricing , see e.g. , @xcite , and portfolio optimization , see e.g. , @xcite . for an overview of the literature on applications of copulas in finance",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "copulas allow to separate the dependence structure of random variables from their marginal distributions .",
    "this is sometimes useful in statistical applications as the dependence structure and the marginal distributions can be modeled separately and joined together resulting in new multivariate distributions with different behavior . for a discussion on difficulties in the application of copulas the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite . here",
    ", we simply view the copulas as providing a standardized way for the study of statistical dependences .",
    "the marginal distributions are mapped to the uniform distribution ; the statistical dependence is considered in terms of the marginal cumulative distribution functions .",
    "recently , we identified market states as clusters of similar correlation matrices and studied their corresponding correlation structures @xcite . the correlation structure , however , does not capture the full statistical dependence between financial return time series . here , we choose a copula approach to study the dependence structure of market states @xcite .",
    "to this end , we estimate empirical copulas for many stock return pairs and average over all of them to obtain an empirical pairwise copula for each market state .",
    "we stress that the identification of market states relies on the correlation matrices , the copulas are used only for analyzing the states and not defining them . to estimate the empirical copulas we use both original and locally normalized returns .",
    "the original return time series exhibit time - varying trends and volatilities @xcite .",
    "these have to be taken into account when transforming the marginal distributions to uniform ones . to this end",
    ", we apply the method of local normalization @xcite , which leads to stationary time series while preserving the correlations between them .",
    "the resulting empirical copulas provide different information .",
    "the copulas for the original returns describe the dependence structure on a global scale , i.e. , for the full time horizon , whereas the copulas for the locally normalized returns describe the dependence structure on a local scale .",
    "the empirical pairwise copulas for each market state are compared with a bivariate k - copula , which arises from a random matrix approach introduced in @xcite .",
    "it models the non - stationarity of true correlations by an ensemble of random matrices .",
    "the model yields a multivariate return distribution in terms of a modified bessel function of the second kind , a so - called k - distribution . in @xcite",
    "the k - distribution was found to provide a good description of the heavy - tailed empirical return distributions for each market state . here , we aim to arrive at a consistent description within the random matrix model studying the agreement between k - copula and empirical dependence structure for each market state .",
    "in addition , our study provides further evidence for asymmetric dependencies between financial returns @xcite .",
    "we find an asymmetry in the tail dependence of empirical pairwise copulas which we study in more detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section2 ]",
    "we review the basic concepts of copulas , stating the main result in the copula theory , the sklar s theorem , which we use to derive a k - copula . in section  [ section3 ]",
    "we present the data set and recapitulate the identification of market states for the nasdaq composite market in the period @xmath0 as done in @xcite . in section  [ section4 ]",
    "we study the empirical copula densities for each market state and compare them with the k - copula .",
    "we conclude our findings in section  [ section5 ] .",
    "we begin with a short introduction to the concept of copulas in  [ section2.1 ] . for more details with an emphasis on the statistical and mathematical foundations of copulas the reader",
    "is referred to the textbooks of joe @xcite and nelsen @xcite . in  [ section2.2 ]",
    "we present the k - copula which plays a central role in this study .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the bivariate case , since later on we study empirical pairwise copulas .",
    "consider two random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the joint distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath2 contains all the statistical information about them .",
    "it can be expressed either in terms of the joint probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath3 or in terms of the joint cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath4 , where @xmath5 from the joint pdf @xmath3 one can extract the individual distributions of @xmath1 and @xmath2 as follows @xmath6 and analogously for @xmath2 . the densities @xmath7 and @xmath8 , called marginal probability density functions , and the corresponding marginal cumulative distribution functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 describe the individual statistical behavior of the random variables .",
    "when dealing with correlated random variables , one is interested in their statistical dependence .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient is commonly used as a measure of dependence .",
    "it is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the covariance of both random variables and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the respective standard deviations .",
    "however , the correlation coefficient only measures the linear dependence between the random variables .",
    "copulas provide a natural way to study the statistical dependence of random variables .",
    "the transformation @xmath15 leads to new random variables with uniform distributions on the unit interval , called the rank of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "their joint distribution is called a copula .",
    "it describes the dependence structure of the random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 separated from their marginal distributions .",
    "a central result in the copula theory is sklar s theorem which enables us to separate any multivariate distribution function into two components : the marginal distributions of each random variable and their copula @xmath16 if the marginal distribution functions are continuous , the copula that satisfies equation  ( [ sklar ] ) is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 represent the inverse cumulative distribution functions , the so called quantile functions .",
    "this equation allows to extract the dependence structure directly from the joint distribution function . from the copula ( [ copula ] )",
    "one can compute the copula density as follows @xmath20      the k - copula arises from a random matrix model introduced in @xcite to model time - varying correlations between financial time series @xcite .",
    "it was first used in @xcite , where it was found to describe the empirical dependencies in financial data much better than a gaussian copula .    consider a market consisting of @xmath21 stocks . at each time",
    "@xmath22 we assume that the return vector @xmath23 is drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with a covariance matrix @xmath24 @xmath25 where we suppress the argument @xmath26 of @xmath27 to simplify our notation .",
    "we now model the time - dependent covariance matrix @xmath24 by a wishart random matrix @xmath28 , where the @xmath29 model matrix @xmath30 is drawn from a gaussian distribution with the pdf @xmath31 here , @xmath32 represents the average covariance matrix estimated over the sample of all @xmath33 .",
    "hence , the time - dependent covariance matrices are modeled by an ensemble of wishart matrices @xmath28 which fluctuate around the sample average @xmath32 . averaging the multivariate normal distribution  ( 8) with the random covariance matrix @xmath28 over the wishart ensemble leads to a k - distribution for the multivariate",

    "it depends only on the average covariance matrix @xmath37 estimated over the whole sample , where @xmath38 is the average correlation matrix and @xmath39 the diagonal matrix of the standard deviations , and a free parameter @xmath40 , which governs the variance of the wishart ensemble @xmath41_{kl})=\\frac{\\sigma_{kl}^2+\\sigma_{kk } \\sigma_{ll}}{n } \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the @xmath43-th element of the average covariance matrix @xmath32 .",
    "thus , it characterizes the strength of fluctuations around the average covariance matrix in the considered sample .",
    "the larger @xmath40 , the smaller the fluctuations around @xmath32 , eventually vanishing in the limit @xmath44 .    the k - copula is the dependence structure which arises for the k - distribution ( [ kdistribution ] ) . for the bivariate case @xmath45 , the pdf of the vector @xmath46 reads @xmath47 here , we used the covariance matrix @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the average correlation coefficient , estimated over the whole sample .",
    "we chose the standard deviations one , @xmath50 , since the copula is independent of the marginal distributions .",
    "then , the marginal distribution densities are identical , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 according to equation  ( [ copula ] ) the bivariate k - copula is given by @xmath53 where @xmath49 and @xmath40 are the parameters of the copula , @xmath54 denotes the cumulative distribution function of the bivariate distribution ( [ kdist_twodim ] ) , and @xmath55 the inverse distribution function of the marginal cdf given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 the k - copula density can be obtained from the k - copula ( [ kcopula ] ) by differentiation @xmath58 it depends only on the average correlation @xmath49 and the free parameter @xmath40 , which characterizes the fluctuations around @xmath32 .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the k - copula density for different parameter values .",
    "the stronger the average correlation @xmath49 and the lower the parameter @xmath40 , the higher is the probability for extreme co - movements .",
    "furthermore , we note that the k - copula is a symmetric copula .",
    "it is based on the elliptical distribution ( [ kdistribution ] ) and thus it belongs to the class of elliptical copulas .",
    "we now present the data set and identify market states as clusters of correlation matrices with similar correlation structures , as done in @xcite .",
    "these market states will be the object of our empirical study in the next section .",
    "we consider @xmath59 stocks of the nasdaq composite index traded in the 22-year period from january 1992 to december 2013 @xcite which corresponds to 5542 trading days .",
    "for each stock @xmath60 we calculate the return time series @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the price of the @xmath63-th stock at time @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the return interval which we chose to be one trading day .    empirical return time series exhibit time - varying drift and volatilities .",
    "the correlation coefficient  ( [ pearson ] ) averages over these time - dependent parameters which results in an estimation error of the correlations . in order to eliminate this kind of error",
    "we employ the method of local normalization @xcite . for each return time series",
    "@xmath60 we subtract the local mean and divide by the local standard deviation @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the local average which runs over the @xmath68 most recent sampling points .",
    "for daily data we use @xmath69 as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the local normalization removes the local trends and variable volatilities while preserving the correlations between the time series .    using the locally normalized daily returns we now obtain a set of 131 correlation matrices estimated on disjoint two - month intervals of the 22-year observation period . to identify market states we perform a clustering analysis based on the partitioning around medoids algorithm @xcite , where the number of clusters is estimated via the gap statistic @xcite .",
    "the clustering analysis separates the set of 131 correlation matrices into six groups based on the similarity of their correlation structures .",
    "each group is associated with a market state .",
    "we point out that the identification of market states is performed ex - post , the clustering algorithm has the correlation matrices of all times .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the time evolution of the six market states .",
    "we observe that the market switches back and forth between states .",
    "sometimes it remains in a state for a long time , sometimes it jumps briefly to another state and returns back or evolves further . on longer time scales the market evolves towards new states , whereas previous states die out .        in the next section",
    "we will study the statistical dependence for each market state . to obtain the return time series for each state , we proceed as follows : we take the complete return time series , @xmath70 or @xmath71 , and divide it into a sequence of disjoint two month intervals .",
    "we merge all intervals belonging to a given state according to the cluster analysis .",
    "we note that the return time series for the six market states differ in length .",
    "we present the empirical pairwise copula densities for each market states in  [ section4.1 ] and compare them with the k - copula densities in  [ section4.2 ] .",
    "in  [ section4.3 ] we study the asymmetry of the tail dependence of the empirical copula densities in more detail .",
    "to estimate the empirical pairwise copula of two return time series @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we first have to transform them into uniformly distributed time series .",
    "to achieve this , we employ the empirical distribution function @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the indicator function , @xmath76 denotes the length of the time series and the factor @xmath77 ensures that the values of the transformed time series @xmath78 lie in the interval @xmath79 .",
    "the empirical copula density of the time series @xmath72 and @xmath73 is then the two - dimensional histogram of the transformed time series @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "an accurate estimation of the copula density requires a large amount of data .",
    "thus , for each state we compute the copula densities of all @xmath82 stock pairs as two - dimensional histograms of the transformed time series and then average over all pairs @xmath83 where the upper index @xmath84 denotes the state number . for the bin size of the histograms we choose @xmath85 .",
    "we note that as the length of the time series for each market state is rather short , we are not able to study the full copulas for each stock pair @xmath86 separately . hence , we can not make any direct statements about similarity and dispersion regarding the full dependence structure .",
    "our results only yield statements about the empirical dependence structure on average .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the empirical pairwise copula densities for the original returns ( [ returns ] ) for each of the six market states .",
    "we observe a variation of the dependence structure from state to state , particularly visible in the tails . in state 1 , which covers the period from 1992 to roughly 2000",
    ", we find a rather flat copula density , indicating low dependence between return pairs . in state 2",
    "we observe deviations from the flat copula density particularly in the tails , which become more and more pronounced in state 3 and 4 .",
    "state 5 , first appearing during the financial crisis in 2008 , exhibits the strongest dependence .",
    "the dependence decreases again in state 6 .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the empirical pairwise copula densities for the locally normalized returns ( [ normreturns ] ) .",
    "the dependence structures of the six states are mostly preserved after performing local normalization .",
    "deviations are observed in the lower - left and the upper - right corners where the copula densities for the original returns exhibit higher peaks .",
    "the reason for that is the time - varying volatility . during periods of high volatility stocks",
    "tend to have large returns which contribute to the corners of the copula density . on the other hand , in periods of high volatility",
    "the correlations between stocks become stronger .",
    "this leads to higher peaks in the corners of the dependence structure for the original returns .",
    "it is important to note that the copulas for the original and the locally normalized returns contain different statements .",
    "the copulas for the original returns describe the dependence structure for the full time horizon . on the other hand ,",
    "the copulas for the locally normalized returns provide information about the statistical dependence on a local scale .    furthermore , we observe that the empirical copula densities are asymmetric with respect to opposite corners .",
    "we find stronger dependence in the lower tail than in the upper one , that is , the dependence between large negative returns is stronger than the dependence between large positive ones .",
    "this asymmetry is an important feature of empirical copula densities and thus we will discuss it in more details in section  [ section4.3 ] .",
    "we now compare the empirical pairwise copula densities for each market state with the k - copula densities .",
    "again , we consider both the original and the locally normalized returns . the k - copula density is obtained in the following way : we calculate the k - copula according to equation ( [ kcopula ] ) where the integrals are performed numerically . the k - copula density for each bin of size @xmath85",
    "is then estimated by @xmath87 for comparison we compute the difference between empirical and analytical copula density for each state @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the average correlation coefficient of all @xmath82 stock pairs for the considered state .",
    "the free parameter @xmath40 is estimated by a fit which minimizes the mean squared difference between empirical and analytical copula density .",
    "the parameter values for each market state are summarized in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "rrrrrrrr returns & & state 1 & state 2 & state 3 & state 4 & state 5 & state 6 + & @xmath90 & 0.046 & 0.13 & 0.17 & 0.25 & 0.42 & 0.22 + & @xmath40 & 41.7 & 11.7 & 8.4 & 5.6 & 2.8 & 10.0 +   + & @xmath90 & 0.048 & 0.13 & 0.19 & 0.28 & 0.43 & 0.25 + & @xmath40 & 70.7 & 28.6 & 29.8 & 15.8 & 7.4 & 20.4 +    the differences between the empirical copula density and the k - copula density for each state are presented in figure  [ fig5 ] for the original and in figure  [ fig6 ] for the locally normalized returns .",
    "overall , we find a good agreement between empirical and analytical copula densities .",
    "the k - copula seems to capture the dependence structure of the first three states very well .",
    "small deviations from the k - copula density are observed for state 4 and 6 .",
    "only the dependence structure of state 5 can not be captured by the k - copula . for the locally normalized returns we find a better agreement , which is reflected in the smaller mean squared differences ,",
    "see table  [ table2 ] .",
    "deviations are observed mainly in the corners of the copula densities .",
    "the empirical copula densities exhibit stronger dependence in the tails ,",
    "i.e. , the probability for extreme co - movements is underestimated by the k - copula .",
    ".mean squared differences between empirical and k - copula densities . [",
    "cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is important to note that the k - copula captures the empirical dependence structure rather well with only one free parameter .",
    "however , due to its symmetric nature it can not account for the asymmetry observed in the data .",
    "the skewed student s @xmath26-copula is an alternative proposed by @xcite which was found to account for asymmetric dependencies in financial data @xcite .",
    "it captures the empirical dependence structure of the original returns better than the k - copula due to the presence of an additional parameter which accounts for the asymmetry @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , here we confine ourselves to the comparison of the empirical copulas with the k - copula as we aim to arrive at a consistent picture within the random matrix model .",
    "we discuss the asymmetry in more detail in the following .",
    "asymmetric dependence between returns has been reported by several authors , see e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our study provides further evidence revealing a stronger lower tail dependence in the empirical copula densities of market states .",
    "we now take a closer look at this asymmetry . to this end",
    ", we estimate the tail dependence in the four corners for all @xmath82 empirical pairwise copulas according to @xmath91 where the upper index @xmath92 denotes the state number and the lower indices represent a stock pair @xmath86 . here , ll and uu refer to the lower - lower and upper - upper corners , respectively , and represent the positive tail dependence , whereas ul and lu refer to the upper - lower and lower - upper corners , respectively , and represent the negative tail dependence .",
    "the asymmetry in the tail dependence can now be quantified by the differences @xmath93 where @xmath94 captures the asymmetry of the positive and @xmath95 the asymmetry of the negative tail dependence for each stock pair @xmath60,@xmath96 .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the histograms of the asymmetry values exemplarily for state 5 . for the returns we find a negative offset for the values of @xmath97 , whereas the values of @xmath98 are centered around zero .",
    "this indicates , on average , an asymmetry in the positive tail dependence , i.e. , simultaneous large negative returns are more likely to occur than simultaneous large positive returns .",
    "on the other hand , we do not find such an asymmetry in the negative tail dependence .",
    "for the locally normalized returns , we find much weaker asymmetry in the positive tail dependence and once again no asymmetry for the negative tail dependence .",
    "we note that the means of the asymmetry values are the relevant quantities , the asymmetry values for each pair are distributed around the mean due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "the standard deviation for @xmath97 is 0.01 and for @xmath98 0.007 .",
    "indeed , the asymmetry effect is very small .",
    "still , it is clearly visible , see figure  [ fig3 ] .        in the following ,",
    "we study the asymmetry values for each market state .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] shows the mean asymmetry values @xmath99 for each market state , obtained by averaging over all @xmath94 for a given state . on a local scale",
    "the asymmetry in the positive tail dependence is much weaker . only state 5 still exhibits a certain amount of asymmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "the asymmetry in the negative tail dependence is negligibly small for both original and locally normalized returns .",
    "we studied the dependence structure of market states by means of a copula approach . to this end",
    ", we estimated the empirical pairwise copulas for each state and compared them with the bivariate k - copula . the bivariate k - copula arises from a random matrix model where the non - stationarity of correlations is taken into account by an ensemble of random matrices .",
    "it is a symmetric , elliptical copula , which depends on two parameters : the average correlation coefficient , estimated over the considered sample of returns , and a free parameter which characterizes the fluctuations around the average correlation in this sample .",
    "we estimated the empirical pairwise copulas for both original and locally normalized returns .",
    "the local normalization removes the time - varying trends and volatilities while preserving the dependence structure .",
    "the corresponding copula describes the dependence structure on a local scale , whereas the copula of the original returns provides information about the dependence structure on a global scale , i.e. , for the full time horizon .",
    "overall , the k - copula captures the empirical dependence structure of market states .",
    "we found a good agreement , in particular for the copulas estimated on a local scale .",
    "thus , we obtain a consistent description within the random matrix model : the k - distribution describes the heavy - tailed return distributions while the k - copula captures the corresponding dependence structure .",
    "however , we found an asymmetry in the positive tail dependence , i.e. , a stronger lower tail dependence , indicating a larger probability for simultaneous extreme negative returns .",
    "this asymmetry can not be captured by our model .",
    "it is more pronounced on a global scale . on a local scale",
    "we find a much weaker asymmetry .",
