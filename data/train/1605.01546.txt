    "the process of heat transport in a solid mainly involves conduction , radiation and absorption of heat .",
    "when the absorption is absent in the steady state limit , the temperature profile of a solid bar falls exponentially from high to low temperature end of the bar if the radiated heat obeys newton s laws of cooling and the conducted current density obeys fourier s law : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the local temperature gradient and @xmath3 is the thermal conductivity . in the steady state",

    "we take the ordered , anharmonic crystal in three dimension in the form of slab geometry .",
    "apart from the baths attached to the extremities , there are baths attached to the intermediate surfaces of the slab and the heat is allowed to flow between intermediate surfaces and the attached baths@xcite .",
    "we show using langevin equation approach that fourier s law remains valid in the thermodynamic limit and a temperature dependent conductivity is obtained to leading order in anharmonic coupling .",
