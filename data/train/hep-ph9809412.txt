    "according to the factorization theorem of perturbative qcd @xcite inclusive cross section of a hard process should increase proportionally to @xmath2 in p+a interactions and proportionaly to @xmath3 in a+a collisions .",
    "models describing @xmath0 production are built on the basis of this prediction ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "they treat creation of a @xmath4 pairs as a hard process and they further assume that the initial number of @xmath0 mesons is proportional to the number of charm pairs . therefore in the absence of medium effects the @xmath0 cross section is expected to increase as @xmath5 for p+a ( a+a ) collisions .    experimental results on @xmath0 production in p+a interactions contradict this naive expectation showing an increase of the cross section proportional to @xmath6 .",
    "this reduction of the @xmath2dependence is usually explained as being predominantly due to final state interactions of the @xmath0 meson ( or its premeson state ) with nucleons @xcite .",
    "however models based on this picture and parameters fitted to the p+a data in general overpredict recent results on @xmath0 production in central pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "this reduction of @xmath0 production in the latter data is usually interpreted as due to interactions of @xmath0 ( pre)mesons with surrounding high density matter ( ultimately the quark gluon plasma ) @xcite .    in high energy a+a collisions ( from central s+s to central pb+pb )",
    "the multiplicity of pions and strange hadrons increase proportionally to the number of colliding nucleons ( participant nucleons ) @xcite . these data and their interpretation in terms of a statistical qgp model @xcite suggested the question whether a similar dependence may be observed for charm and consequently for @xmath0 production .",
    "a simple estimation of the centrality dependence of the @xmath0 to pion ratio in pb+pb collisions indicates that this hypothesis may be in fact correct @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to review available experimental results to obtain information concerning the @xmath2dependence of @xmath0 yield .",
    "in particular we study the @xmath2dependence of the @xmath0 to pion ratio using results on proton  proton and nucleus  nucleus interactions ( sections 2 and 3 ) and proton  nucleus interactions ( section 4 ) .",
    "we summarize also results on the @xmath2dependence of the open charm yield in p+a interactions ( section 5 ) .",
    "in p+p interactions the @xmath0 cross section was measured at five different collision energies , @xmath7 = 6.8 gev @xcite , 8.7 gev @xcite , 19.4 gev @xcite , 24.3 gev @xcite and 52 gev @xcite .",
    "most of the data are measured for @xmath8 and they are not corrected for the branching ratio to the measured decay channel .    the mean multiplicity of @xmath0 mesons in full momentum space , @xmath9 , is obtained in the following way . the @xmath10 distribution of @xmath0 is assumed to be symmetric with respect to reflection at @xmath10 = 0 .",
    "the most recent values of the branching ratios @xmath11 ( @xmath12 = 0.0601 ) and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 = 0.0602 ) were used @xcite .",
    "the cross sections of @xmath0 production were further divided by the cross sections for inelastic p+p interactions at the corresponding collision energy .",
    "the latter cross sections were calculated according to the parametrization of the experimental data given in @xcite .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath9 are given in table 1 .",
    "for comparison with the data on nucleus  nucleus collisions at the sps the mean @xmath0 multiplicity for p+p interactions at 158 gev ( @xmath7 = 17.3 gev ) is needed . in this energy range",
    "the energy dependence of the integrated cross section for @xmath0 production can be conveniently parametrized by @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are parameters fitted to the data , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are @xmath0 cross section and mass , respectively .",
    "this parametrization predicts a decrease of the @xmath0 yield by about 25% when going from @xmath7 = 19.4 gev to @xmath7 = 17.3 gev .",
    "thus we can estimate @xmath9 to be @xmath20 at @xmath7 = 17.3 gev using the measured value of @xmath9 = @xmath21 at @xmath7 = 19.4 gev ( see table i ) .",
    "the result of the above interpolation , shown by the open circle in fig .",
    "1 , agrees with the value estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite for p+p interactions at 150 gev using data available at this energy @xcite and an additional assumption concerning an unpublished ratio of cross sections .",
    "the mean multiplicity of negatively charged hadrons ( more than 90% are @xmath22mesons ) in nucleon ",
    "nucleon ( n+n ) interactions at 158 gev is @xmath23 = @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "this mean multiplicity was calculated as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are mean multiplicities of negatively charged hadrons for p+p , p+n and n+n interactions at 158 a@xmath1gev , respectively @xcite .",
    "taking the value of @xmath9 calculated above we obtain @xmath29 for n+n interactions at @xmath7 = 17.3 gev .",
    "this ratio is further used for the comparison with nucleus  nucleus data .",
    "the production of @xmath0 in nucleus ",
    "nucleus collisions was measured by the na38 collaboration for o+cu , o+u and s+u interactions at 200 a@xmath1gev @xcite and by the na50 collaboration for pb+pb interactions at 158 a@xmath1gev @xcite . the procedure which allows to calculate the @xmath30 ratio from the published data",
    "is described below using as an example the pb+pb results .    the measured @xmath0",
    "cross section in minimum bias pb+pb collisions is : @xmath31 this cross section refers to the na50 acceptance @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the @xmath0 rapidity calculated in the c.m .",
    "system and @xmath35 is the collins  soper angle @xcite . in order to get an estimate of the total @xmath0 cross section we assume that the @xmath0 production for @xmath36 can be neglected and that the distribution in @xmath37 is uniform @xcite .",
    "this leads to a correction factor for the acceptance equal to 4 .",
    "based on the h+p results at 200 gev @xcite one can estimate that neglecting @xmath0 yield at @xmath36 may lead to an underestimation of the @xmath0 multiplicity by less than 30% .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached when the @xmath0 rapidity distribution in pb+pb collisions is assumed to be similar to the rapidity distribution of the @xmath38 mesons measured by the na49 collaboration @xcite .",
    "in addition , the cross section presented by na50 is corrected here for the branching ratio @xmath11 ( @xmath12 = 0.0601 ) @xcite .",
    "the cross section for @xmath0 production resulting from the above procedure is : @xmath39 where systematic uncertainty of our extrapolation procedure is not included in the quoted error .",
    "the @xmath0 multiplicity can be calculated as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total cross section of inelastic pb+pb collisions calculated to be 7040 mb using a parametrization of the measured data given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results of the na35 and na49 collaborations @xcite indicate that the ratio of @xmath23 to the mean number of participant nucleons , @xmath42 , is the same for central s+s and pb+pb collisions 158 a@xmath1gev and equal to @xmath43 .",
    "we assume therefore the same value of the ratio for inelastic pb+pb collisions .",
    "using the mean number of participant nucleons for the latter collisions calculated within the fritiof model @xcite ( @xmath44 ) we get @xmath45 .",
    "this leads to @xmath46 for inelastic pb+pb collisions at 158 a@xmath1gev .",
    "a similar procedure is used to calculate the @xmath30 ratio for o+cu , o+u and s+u interactions .",
    "there are however two difference .",
    "the @xmath0 cross sections for oxygen and sulphur induced reactions are measured at 200 a@xmath1gev @xcite .",
    "therefore for the comparison with the results at 158 a@xmath1gev the measured values are scaled down by 25% according to the energy dependence of the @xmath0 multiplicity established for p+p interactions ( see section 2 ) . due to projectile ",
    "target asymmetry the @xmath10 distribution of @xmath0 is expected to be not symmetric with respect to reflection at @xmath47 .",
    "the correction for this effect is negelected .",
    "the ratios obtained for nucleus  nucleus collisions and the corresponding ratio for n+n interactions at the 158 a@xmath1gev are shown in fig .",
    "2 as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "it is surprising that the ratio @xmath30 is similar for nucleon  nucleon and nucleus  nucleus interactions .",
    "one should however keep in mind that the ratios for nucleus  nucleus collisions may be underestimated by up to 30% .",
    "we repeat that this uncertainty is due to limited accepetance of the @xmath0 measurement for nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
    "this systematic error can be reduced when the results on the rapidity or @xmath10 distributions are published .",
    "finally we note that the ratio @xmath48 is expected to increase by a factor of about 3 when going from n+n to pb+pb interactions , where @xmath49 denotes here a mean multiplicity of any process for which the cross section in a+a collisions increases as @xmath50 .",
    "the inclusive cross section for @xmath0 production in p+a interactions is measured in the region @xmath51 0 and it is usually parametrized as @xcite : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are parameters fitted to the experimental data .",
    "a strong dependence of @xmath54 on @xmath10 was recently measured by the e866 collaboration @xcite at 800 gev .",
    "the @xmath10 distribution of @xmath0 decreases by a factor of about 10 from @xmath10 = 0 to @xmath10 = 0.4 @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath2dependence of the integrated @xmath0 cross section in the region @xmath8 is dominated by the dependence measured close to @xmath47 .",
    "the values of @xmath54 obtained from @xmath10 integrated data ( @xmath55 ) or from the data close to @xmath47 range from 0.89 to 0.94 .",
    "the results were obtained by various experiments @xcite in the collision energy range 200800 gev and they were compiled in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath54 values are shown in fig .",
    "3 as a function of @xmath7 ( filled circles ) .    in order to compare the @xmath2dependence of @xmath0 and @xmath56 production the parameter @xmath57 was fitted here to data @xcite on the total multiplicity of negatively charged hadrons produced in p+a interactions at 200 gev and 360 gev . in the fit the multiplicity of proton  nucleon ( p+n ) interactions at the corresponding energy was included .",
    "this multiplicity was calculated as @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "finally the @xmath57 parameter fitted to the multiplicity data was added to the @xmath57 parameter obtained by the fit to the inelastic cross section results ( @xmath59 ) @xcite .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath60 ( @xmath60 = 0.88 @xmath61 0.01 at 200 gev and @xmath60 = 0.90 @xmath61 0.02 at 360 gev ) are shown in fig .",
    "4 ( open circles ) .",
    "the values of @xmath60 are similar to the values of @xmath54 .",
    "there is no evidence for any significant energy dependence both for @xmath60 and @xmath54 .",
    "similar values of the @xmath57 parameter for @xmath56 and @xmath0 production imply that the ratio @xmath62 is approximately independent of @xmath2 for p+a interactions at high energy .",
    "we note that the difference in the @xmath57 parameter of 0.02 ( typical for the values shown in fig .",
    "3 ) results in 10% change in the multiplicity ratio between p+n and p+pb interactions . this can be compared to about 70% increase of the ratio @xmath63 expected when going from p+n to p+pb interactions , where @xmath49 denotes here a mean multiplicity of any process for which the cross section in p+a interactions increases as @xmath2 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "the measurements of @xmath0 production in the backward hemisphere ( @xmath65 ) are poor . however , the experimental data @xcite seems to indicate that @xmath54 for @xmath65 is similar to @xmath54 for @xmath8 ( we note that this is not the case for pion production ) .",
    "this suggests that our conclusion concerning the similar @xmath2dependence of @xmath56 and @xmath0 production , based on the @xmath0 data from the forward hemisphere only , may remain unchanged when the @xmath0 results in full phase space become available .",
    "the main result of this paper is that the ratio of mean multiplicities of @xmath0 mesons and pions is similar for inelastic proton ",
    "proton , proton  nucleus and nucleus  nucleus interactions at 158 a@xmath1gev . in our opinion",
    "this experimental observation justifies a question whether the generally accepted picture of @xmath0 creation based on the factorization theorem of the perturbative qcd and subsequent suppression of the @xmath0 yield by the interactions with the surrounding medium is valid . in this picture the observed scaling behaviour of the data , @xmath66 , can be treated only as due to accidental cancelation of several large effects .",
    "it is obvious that the mechanism of @xmath0 production can not be understood without data on open charm creation .",
    "published data on @xmath67 and @xmath68 production in p+a interactions are insufficient .",
    "the results on the @xmath2dependence are summarized in fig .",
    "4 , where @xmath69 is shown as a function of @xmath10 for interactions at 400 gev @xcite and 800 gev @xcite .",
    "it is clear that these data do not allow to distinguish between @xmath70 , as usually assumed for charm production on the basis of perturbative qcd , and @xmath71 , the value obtained for pion and @xmath0 production .",
    "data on open charm production in nucleus  nucleus collisions do not exist .",
    "it is therefore crucial for our understanding of the mechanism of charm creation and @xmath0 production to measure open charm yields in nucleus  nucleus collisions .",
