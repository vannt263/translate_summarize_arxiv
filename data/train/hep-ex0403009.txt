    "the igex experiment , originally optimized for detecting @xmath4ge double beta decay , has been described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "one of the enriched ( 86% in @xmath4ge ) igex detectors ( named rg - ii ) of 2.2 kg ( 2.0 kg active mass ) is being used to look for wimps interacting coherently with the germanium nuclei .",
    "its full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) energy resolution is 2.37kev at the 1333kev line of @xmath5co , and the low energy long - term energy resolution ( fwhm ) is 1kev at the 46.5kev line of @xmath6pb .",
    "the lines of an external @xmath7na source and the excited x - rays of pb have been used for periodic energy calibrations at high and low energies .",
    "we refer to papers @xcite where the latest results of the experiment regarding dark matter searches are presented and where the aspects related to the experimental set - up , shielding , data acquisition system , etc .",
    "are described .",
    "the threshold of the experiment is 4kev and the raw background registered in the region just above the threshold is of a few tenths of counts/(kgdaykev ) , the lowest raw background ( i.e.with no nuclear recoil discrimination mechanism ) ever achieved in this energy range .        particularly interesting for the purpose of the present work is the shielding used in the experiment . leaving more detailed information for the references previously mentioned ,",
    "it can be described as follows .",
    "the innermost part consists of about 2.5 tons of 2000-year - old archaeological lead ( having @xmath39mbq / kg of @xmath6pb(@xmath6bi ) , @xmath30.2mbq / kg of @xmath8u , and @xmath30.3mbq / kg of @xmath9th ) forming a cubic block of 60 cm side .",
    "the germanium detector is fitted into a precision - machined chamber made in this central core , which minimizes the empty space around the detector available to radon .",
    "nitrogen gas , at a rate of 140l / hour , evaporating from liquid nitrogen , is forced into the small space left in the detector chamber to create a positive pressure and further minimize radon intrusion .",
    "the archaeological lead block is surrounded by 20 cm of lead bricks made from 70-year - old low - activity lead ( @xmath1010tons ) having @xmath1030bq / kg of @xmath6pb .",
    "the whole lead shielding forms a 1 m side cube , the detector being surrounded by not less than 40 - 45 cm of lead ( 25 cm of which is archaeological ) .",
    "two layers of plastic seal this central assembly against radon intrusion and a 2-mm - thick cadmium sheet surrounds the ensemble . specially relevant for the present work",
    "are the cosmic muon vetoes ( bc408 plastic scintillators ) covering the top and three sides of the shield .",
    "its effect on the background reduction in the low energy region will be stressed in section 3 , where the neutrons induced by muons in the shielding are studied .",
    "finally , an external neutron moderator ( made of polyethylene bricks and borated water tanks ) surrounds the whole set - up .",
    "its thickness has been changed in several occasions , giving rise to independent sets of data whose differences will be particularly useful in this analysis . see a sketch of the set - up in fig .",
    "[ drawing ] .",
    "the body of data to be used in the present work has been divided in four different sets ( a , b , c and d ) according basically to the thickness of the outer neutron moderator wall used in the shielding ( 0 , 20 , 40 and 80 cm respectively ) .",
    "some parameters concerning each set of data are quoted in table [ sets ] , and the low energy spectral shapes are plotted in fig .",
    "[ spectrasets ] .",
    "the sets b and c correspond mostly to the data already presented in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite respectively with added statistics .",
    "the data sets a and d were taken more recently to complete the present analysis .",
    "a word of caution must be said concerning the oldest data set b since there are more differences in the experimental set - up with respect to the other sets than just the neutron shielding : four ge detectors were in the same lead shielding and the outer location of the corresponding four liquid n@xmath11 dewars left two of the shielding sides without moderator . therefore , set b will be included in some plots just to have another intermediate situation between the two extreme cases a and d , but no quantitative conclusion about neutrons will be drawn from it . in the other three data sets ( a , c and d )",
    "the experimental set - up has been exactly the same except for the thickness of the moderator wall .",
    ".main features of the data sets a , b , c and d : statistics time , thickness of the neutron moderator and measured average background level ( in anticoincidence with the veto system ) from 4 to 10kev . [",

    "<S> a quantitative study of the neutron environment in the canfranc underground laboratory has been performed . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is based on a complete set of simulations and , particularly , it is focused on the igex - dm dark matter experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations are compared to the igex - dm low energy data obtained with different shielding conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the study allow us to conclude , with respect to the igex - dm background , that the main neutron population , coming from radioactivity from the surrounding rock , is practically eliminated after the implementation of a suitable neutron shielding . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining neutron background ( muon - induced neutrons in the shielding and in the rock ) is substantially below the present background level thanks to the muon veto system . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the present analysis gives us a further insight on the effect of neutrons in other current and future experiments at the canfranc underground laboratory . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of simulations with the body of data available has allowed to set the flux of neutrons from radioactivity of the canfranc rock , ( @xmath0 , as well as the flux of muon - induced neutrons in the rock , @xmath1 , or the rate of neutron production by muons in the lead shielding , ( @xmath2 .    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    ,    underground muons , dark matter , muon flux , neutron background 28.20.gd , 96.40.tv , 25.30.mr , 95.35.+d    the search for dark matter is one of the biggest challenges of modern cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> last observational data @xcite are compatible with a flat accelerating universe with a matter content of around 30% , where about 25% is dark matter , mostly in the form of non - baryonic cold dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> even though the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics does not offer a proper candidate satisfying all the needed requirements , its supersymetric extensions open a new world of particles . </S>",
    "<S> experiments looking for cold , non - baryonic , weakly interacting , massive neutral particles beyond the sm generically called wimps supposedly forming this missing matter of the universe are obviously of most relevance for particle physics and cosmology and so the number of such attempts with a large variety of techniques , detectors and targets is quite numerous @xcite .    in experiments intended for wimp direct detection , such as igex dark matter ( igex - dm ) </S>",
    "<S> , galactic wimps could be detected by means of the nuclear recoil they would produce when scattered off target nuclei of suitable detectors . </S>",
    "<S> the sensitivity of these experiments has been continuously increasing since the first searches , more than fifteen years ago , thanks to higher levels of radiopurity of detectors , discrimination techniques and a deeper understanding of the various sources of radioactive background . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the background of these experiments is then a very important activity in their development . </S>",
    "<S> even though the neutron component of the background has been always a matter of concern for shallow site experiments @xcite , in deep underground locations it used to be by far below the level of the typical gamma background . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , however , the extreme level of radiopurity and the expertise achieved in low background techniques , as in the case of igex @xcite , has reduced the raw background to levels where the neutron contribution can be of great importance . </S>",
    "<S> these facts , together with the recent development of discrimination techniques to disentangle nuclear recoils produced by particle dark matter interactions from electron recoils generated by the typical gamma or beta background @xcite have made the neutrons to remain as the real worrisome background for wimps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they can produce nuclear recoils ( @xmath3100kev ) in the detector target nuclei which would mimic wimp interactions . </S>",
    "<S> simple kinematics tells that in the case of germanium , neutrons of 1(5)mev could elastically scatter off germanium nuclei producing recoils of energies up to 54(268)kev .        the present work deals with the study of the neutron background in the underground environment of the canfranc underground laboratory ( lsc ) ( 2450m.w.e . </S>",
    "<S> , see fig .  [ canfranc ] ) , and in particular of its fast component with effect on the igex - dm experiment . in section 1 </S>",
    "<S> the igex - dm experiment is briefly described , especially in the aspects relevant to the present analysis , such as , for instance , the lead and polyethylene shieldings and the active veto system . </S>",
    "<S> the body of data available for this study is also presented . in section 2 , a brief outline of the simulations performed and their technical details are given . </S>",
    "<S> sections 3 , 4 and 5 present the results from the simulations and their comparison with experimental data concerning the three relevant neutron populations . </S>",
    "<S> the final conclusions are gathered in section 6 . </S>"
