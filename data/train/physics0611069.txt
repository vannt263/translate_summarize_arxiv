    "the study of nonequilibrium phenomena of naturally occurring  @xcite , and laboratory plasmas  @xcite has been an active area of research in plasma physics . within this frame work ,",
    "the self organized criticality ( soc ) concept has been quite rigorously deployed to explain some of the turbulent transport observations in magnetically confined fusion devices like tokamaks  @xcite .",
    "the physics of glow discharge plasmas  @xcite in the last two decades , have generated a renewed interest due to their importance in low temperature plasma applications  @xcite .",
    "being a nonlinear medium , they have been a good test bed to investigate various nonlinear phenomena like chaos etc  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have attempted to apply , quite successfully the soc concept for the first time to some of the turbulent fluctuations in a glow discharge plasma .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : setupresult ] we describe the experimental setup and observations . in section  [ sec : soc ]",
    "we present the analysis techniques and results of the spectral and statistical methods that have been carried to substantiate the soc behavior .",
    "finally we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the experiment was carried out in a coaxial cylindrical glow dc discharge plasma system with argon as shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the hollow stainless steel ( ss ) outer cylinder of 45 mm diameter is the cathode and the ss rod of 1 mm diameter inside the cathode is the anode , which is grounded .",
    "the whole system was placed in a vacuum chamber , and evacuated to a base pressure of @xmath0 torr by means of a rotary pump .",
    "argon gas was introduced using precision needle valve into the chamber .",
    "plasma discharges were obtained over a wide range of filling pressure and discharge voltage . a langmuir probe made of tungsten of diameter @xmath1 mm and length @xmath2 mm",
    "was used to measure the electrostatic floating potential fluctuations in the plasma at about 12.5 mm from the anode ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "the fluctuating data of 2500 points was recorded at a sampling rate @xmath3 sec using a textronix oscilloscope , and then transferred to the computer for further analysis .",
    "( a ) , @xmath4 ( b ) , @xmath5 ( c ) , @xmath6 ( d ) , and @xmath7 torr ( e ) respectively.,width=321 ]    keeping the discharge voltage at a constant value of 800 v , a discharge was struck with a very faint glow at @xmath8 torr , and , then as the filling pressure was gradually increased by means of the needle valve , the intensity of the glow suddenly became bright at about @xmath9 torr . the sudden change in the plasma dynamics at the critical pressure led to a change in the floating potential , and the discharge current .",
    "the variation of the plasma floating potential , and the plasma discharge current with pressure have been shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "it shows that , the current ( solid line ) jumped to a larger value by a factor of 15 at @xmath10 torr , and then increased gradually with pressure . on the other hand",
    ", the floating potential rapidly fell to a negative value ( @xmath11 v ) up to the same critical pressure ( @xmath10 torr ) , and then again increased ( dotted line in fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) with further increase in pressure , until it finally settled down to @xmath12 v. so the critical pressure divides the scanned region into two regions i and ii , shown by a vertical line ( @xmath13 ) in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the plasma density , temperature , and electron - electron collision mean free path in region ii are @xmath14 , 2 - 4 ev , and @xmath15 cm respectively .",
    "however , in region i , it was almost impossible to obtain the i - v characteristics because of their extremely low values . qualitatively looking at discharge current , and glow intensity ,",
    "region ii is probably a normal glow discharge region , while region i might be the dark or subnormal glow discharge region .",
    "the critical pressure where the transition takes place is not a fixed point , but decreases with the discharge voltage as seen in figure  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "it is also seen that the floating potential , and the discharge current also decrease with discharge voltage .",
    "figures  [ fig:4](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) are the typical electrostatic fluctuations at pressures @xmath16 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 torr respectively in region i , while ( d ) , and ( e ) are the fluctuations at pressures @xmath6 and @xmath7 torr respectively in region ii .",
    "the experimental evidences considered as main ingredients of soc are @xmath17 ( @xmath180 ) power law ( where @xmath19 is the frequency of the fluctuations obtained from fast fourier transform )  @xcite , long - range correlation  @xcite , and nongaussian probability distribution function ( pdf )  @xcite . from the power spectral analysis",
    "we have estimated the @xmath20 from ln(power ) versus ln(@xmath19 ) . for long - range time correlation we estimated the hurst exponent h , and the exponent ( @xmath21 ) of autocorrelation function ( acf ) decay , as described bellow .    _ * hurst exponent*_-the rescaled - range statistics @xmath22 method was proposed by hurst and well established by mandelbrot , and wallis  @xcite . for the time series defined above",
    ", the @xmath23 is defined as  @xcite the ratio of the maximal range of the integrated signal normalized to the standard deviation : @xmath24 here @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and n are respectively the mean , variance , and time lag of the signal .",
    "the expected value of @xmath23 scales like @xmath28 as @xmath29 , where h is called the hurst exponent . for random data",
    "h=0.5 , while @xmath30 for the data with long range correlations .",
    "@xmath31 indicates the presence of long - range anti - persistency in the data .",
    "the acf has been derived as follows :    _ * auto - correlation*_-for a time series of length n , @xmath32 $ ] , the acf function can be written as  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath26 , and @xmath34 are the mean , and time lag of the time series respectively . if there is long - range time dependence in the system ,",
    "then the algebraic decay of the acf can be written as  @xcite    @xmath35    for large @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .    in order to verify nongaussianity we obtained the pdf of the fluctuating data .",

    ", width=321 ]    figure  [ fig:5 ] shows ln ( power ) vs. ln @xmath19 of the fluctuations in region i from which we estimated the exponent to be @xmath38 .",
    "this agrees well with the numerical  @xcite , as well as experimental observations  @xcite in the presence of soc behavior .",
    "figure  [ fig:6 ] shows a typical plot of ln(r / s ) vs. ln(time lag ) of the fluctuations in region i , for a pressure of @xmath39 .",
    "the hurst exponent h is about @xmath40 ( this indicates long - range time correlations )  @xcite , and it is almost constant over the entire pressure range in region i. on the other hand , for sinusoidal like oscillation in region ii , the hurst exponent is 1 for the lag length of one period of oscillations , and zero with more than one period lag  @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig:7 ] .",
    "also in the same region ( ii ) multi slope ln(r",
    "/ s ) vs. ln(lag ) plot as seen in figure  [ fig:8 ] probably due to plasma instabilities of many frequencies  @xcite .",
    "the acf exponent @xmath21 has been calculated for the fluctuations in region i from the ln(acf ) vs. ln(time lag ) plot as shown in figure  [ fig:9 ] . the acf ( fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ) shows power law up to about 6 times the decorrelation time , and after that it follows exponential decay .",
    "average value of @xmath21 is about 0.30 . using the relation @xmath41",
    "@xcite , h calculated from acf is @xmath42 0.85 , which is close to the value of h , calculated using r / s technique . in region",
    "ii no power law decay of acf has been observed .",
    ".in the following table the decay exponent @xmath21 of the acf , h from acf , h using r / s , and the power spectral index @xmath20 have been shown in the second , third , fourth , and fifth column respectively , for the pressures shown in the column one . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]    the pdf of the floating potential fluctuations in region i seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:10](a ) clearly shows a nongaussian nature .",
    "corresponding best gaussian fit is given by dotted curve in the same figure .",
    "we suspect that there might be a slightly bimodal distribution similar to ref .",
    "figure  [ fig:10](b ) shows the gaussian nature of the fluctuations in region ii .",
    "our results of hurst exponent , @xmath30 , acf exponent , @xmath43 , nongaussian pdf , and power spectral index @xmath44 in the pressure range @xmath45 torr , are consistent with the systems exhibiting soc like behavior .",
    "comparison of @xmath21 , h by acf , h by r / s , and @xmath20 have been shown in table  [ table1 ] , for pressures @xmath16 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 torr .",
    "we have obtained soc behavior over a finite range of neutral pressure of @xmath46 torr for a fixed discharge voltage .",
    "glow discharges are simple systems , but their physics can be quite complicated due to the presence of several phenomena like avalanche breakdown , ionization waves , low frequency ion - acoustic instability , double layer , chaos etc .",
    "most of them are highly nonlinear processes and hence one requires different techniques both statistical and spectral to investigate and understand their behavior . from our present analysis",
    "we observe that the plasma dynamics in the region i is compatible with self organized criticality , while region ii is not .",
    "this could also imply that plasma transport in region i is quite different from region ii .",
    "detailed investigations of the spatio - temporal chaos , and the multifractal nature of these fluctuations are in progress and will be reported else where .",
    "we would like to thank the director sinp , for his constant support and a. bal , a. ram , s. sil , d. das , and m. chattopadhya of plasma physics division for the technical assistance , and the other members for their encouragement whenever required ."
