    "effective one - dimensional spin models have been widely applied to the description of thermodynamic properties of hard condensed matter @xcite . however , these models are in general not very useful since they do not result in a phase transition , known to exist in such systems .",
    "nevertheless , the description of systems like quantum dots , quantum wires and then all the way to different soft matter systems , now opens up a possibility to revitalize the importance of one - dimensional spin models for the description of systems with low dimensionality , where one can envision the ordered state as being realized only when spins have a preferred direction .",
    "the application of potts - like many valued spin models allows to distinguish this preferred direction by assigning it a selected spin value . assuming only nearest neighbor interactions",
    ", one can construct a hamiltonian preferring spin states where nearest neighbor spins are in the same , preferred orientation .",
    "this model would be different from the classical potts model and it is not clear , to what extent the introduction of preferred spin value influences the physical properties .",
    "there are several soft matter systems where this kind of considerations would make sense , _",
    "e.g. _ a polypeptide undergoing helix - coil transition @xcite and the stretch - induced transformation from the standard b - dna conformation to a more extended s - dna form @xcite .",
    "specifically , for the helix - coil transition the description of polypeptide conformations can be reduced to consideration of a pair of torsional angles , related to each of the peptide units @xcite .",
    "a two - dimensional plot ( ramachandran s plot ) of accessible _ vs. _ not accessible regions of these variables shows , that helix formation is promoted only when both torsional angles assume values from a well - defined @xmath2-helical region of values .",
    "when modeled in terms of spins , this furthermore implies that the helix can be formed only when spins take on a preferred value .",
    "this is exactly the situation we alluded to above in the sense that there exists a preferred orientation of spin .",
    "the situation with stretch - induced transformation from b - dna to a more extended s - dna is in fact similar since the formalism of the description is based on models of the helix - coil type @xcite .",
    "a preferred direction of the spin is not the only feature differentiating between different models .",
    "there is also the range of interactions that one needs to consider .",
    "specifically , while in the case of a polypeptide chain it is essential that three successive spins all be in a chosen conformation corresponding to a single helix - inducing hydrogen bond @xcite , the description of dna over - stretching implies that up to ten successive spins be engaged in a double helix - engendering hydrogen bond between opposing strands @xcite .",
    "it thus transpires from both examples that it is necessary to consider some finite range of interaction and thus a finite number of nearest spins , @xmath0 , as crucial for the local formation of an ordered state  a hydrogen bond in the considered case .",
    "there are thus two distinguishing features of the one - dimensional spin models worthy of further consideration .",
    "one is the number of nearest spins , entering into the local formation of an ordered state , and the other one is the existence of a preferred spin orientation pertinent to the ordered state .",
    "the effects of the former can be analyzed within the many - valued ( potts ) spin model with an arbitrary but finite range of many - body interactions , while the latter forms the basis of _ the generalized model of polypeptide chain _ ( gmpc ) , accounting for the preferred spin orientation .",
    "gmpc has been formulated several decades ago @xcite and has been extensively studied specifically in the context of the helix - coil transition @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the zimm - bragg model @xcite and the lifson - roig model @xcite both correspond to particular cases of the gmpc variety with @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the wako - saito - munoz - eaton ( wsme ) model , widely applied to protein folding ( see @xcite ) , can also be shown to be related to the gmpc model ( we will further comment on this point in the conclusions ) .",
    "there is thus a spectrum of models that fall within the same class as the gmpc model . on the other hand ,",
    "if no preferred spin value is taken into consideration , the standard potts model with nearest - neighbor interactions ( @xmath3 ) @xcite can be applied to a helix - coil transition , as shown by goldstein @xcite . however , for @xmath5 there do not seem to exist any known solutions of the one - dimensional potts model .",
    "we thus embark on a detailed study and comparison of the solutions of the two models for different values of @xmath0 , in order to connect the potts and the gmpc model with many - body interactions with the models that do not allow for a spin hamiltonian description but have been traditionally used to describe the statistical characteristics of the helix - coil transition @xcite .",

    "statistical description of polypeptide chain conformations involves important coarse - graining on the level of the @xmath6 atoms , because of the planar configurations of the atomic groups ( c@xmath16 , c@xmath17 , o@xmath17 , n@xmath18 ) due to specific bond hybridizations .",
    "the planar structure of these groups ( peptide groups ) allows the introduction of virtual bonds , connecting the neighboring asymmetric carbon atoms ( fig .",

    "this description can be further simplified by taking into account that bond lengths and angle values usually vary within very narrow intervals ( average fluctuation of @xmath25 at room temperature ) and their fluctuations can be ignored @xcite .",
    "the only relevant variables remaining are thus the @xmath24 torsional angles ( fig .",
    "[ ff1](b ) ) .    the conformational partition function of the repeating unit can be represented as a finite sum after discretization of the torsional angles ( approximation of rotational isomers ) @xcite , opening up a possibility for a spin - based description of the polypeptide conformations .",

    "@xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the temperature .",
    "one hydrogen bond thus restricts three \\{@xmath34 } pairs of rotation angles and establishes the structure with screw symmetry ( @xmath2-helix ) @xcite . within the spin language",
    "this means that the hydrogen bond fixes three successive spin values along the chain . on the other hand , hydrogen bonds in double stranded dna",
    "are formed between repeating units on the opposite strands and are approximately perpendicular to the dna axis .",
    "creation of hydrogen bonds in one pair of opposing bases thus applies restrictions to conformational states of @xmath35 neighbors ( on the scale of single - strand kuhn length ) @xcite .",
    "it makes sense to generalize and consider that one hydrogen bond formation restricts arbitrary ( but finite ) @xmath0 number of spins @xcite , corresponding to many - body interactions . as helix formation comes at an entropic cost @xcite , the larger is @xmath0 , the higher is such an entropic cost @xcite .",
    "the transformation from a coil to a helical conformation is energetically favorable ( negative hydrogen bond energy is gained ) but entropically unfavorable ( the number of micro - states , available for repeating unit in a helical macro - state is decreased , as compared to the coil ) .",
    "as we show below , the compensation of energetic and entropic costs engenders a transition at the temperature corresponding to @xmath36 .",
    "to summarize , statistical description of the helix - coil transition requires three basic parameters : an energetic parameter , @xmath37 , where @xmath31 is the energy of a hydrogen bond ; an entropic parameter , @xmath30 , that stands for the number of spin values ; and a geometric parameter , @xmath0 , that describes the many - body geometry of the hydrogen bond formation .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can thus be built in terms of the @xmath26 spins @xcite and corresponds to the gmpc model if the proper helix formation demands that @xmath0 successive @xmath38 s are all in the same preferred conformation number , _ e.g. _ @xmath39 ( see fig .  [ ff2 ] , top ) . in the case of no preferred spin assignment to the helix formation we are then back to the potts model ( see fig .",

    "following goldstein s formulation @xcite , _ viz . _ without any distinction between spin values , we construct the hamiltonian for a potts model with @xmath0 many - body interactions as @xmath85 one can notice , that for the same @xmath0 many - body interactions the hamiltonian of potts model contains the product of @xmath1 kronecker symbols instead of exactly @xmath0 such symbols as in the case of the gmpc model .",

    ", we can straightforwardly reconstruct the partition function as @xmath100 with the free energy as @xmath101 and the spatial correlation length as @xmath102 where @xmath99 is the maximal and @xmath103 is the second largest eigenvalue .",
    "this means that the thermodynamics of the model is determined by its characteristic equation .",
    "the comparison of eq .  [ chareqnt ] with eq .",
    "[ chareqpotts1 ] reveals similarities and differences between the two considered models , as obviously @xmath104 and therefore the properties of the potts model defined by @xmath105 are related to the properties of the gmpc model of @xmath106 . in the region of positive temperatures ( @xmath107 ) the first bracket of eq .",
    "[ compare ] has two positive roots , while the second bracket has a single , positive and @xmath29 times degenerate root .     ( a )     ( b )     ( c )    detailed analysis reveals that the root from the second bracket is always in between the two roots from the first bracket ( see fig .",
    "[ ff ] ) , so that the maximal root ( which determines the free energy ) always originates from the first bracket . in other words , the one - dimensional potts model with @xmath0 many - body interactions has the same free energy as @xmath1-many - body gmpc model .",
    "all averages that depend on the largest eigenvalue only , such as helicity degree or number of junctions @xcite , are therefore the same for both models .    however , correlation lengths are obviously different , as is illustrated on fig .",
    "this follows since the correlation length for the potts model is determined _ via _",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath103 , while for the gmpc model _ via _ @xmath99 and @xmath108 . indeed , as one can see on fig .",
    "[ ff ] , while the correlation lengths of both models coincide at low @xmath109 ( high temperatures ) , they differ essentially at intermediate to high values of @xmath109 ( low temperatures ) .",
    "the correlation length of the potts model abruptly increases close to the temperature , where energetic and entropic parameters compensate each other ( @xmath110 ) , while the correlation length of the gmpc model goes through a maximum at this point .",
    "the appearance of large correlations in the potts model is a direct consequence of the absence of a preferred spin value , meaning that the standard potts model is not suitable to describe the systems with a special , preferred direction of the spin , conditioned by an external field or by the structure of the system , as is the case in biopolymers .",
    "the one - dimensional nature of the considered models allowed us to explicitly construct the transfer - matrix for @xmath0 many - body potts model eq .",
    "[ g_3potts ] and to derive the corresponding secular equation eq .",
    "[ chareqpotts ] .",
    "the three largest eigenvalues , most important for resulting thermodynamics , were considered for several finite @xmath0s . as a result , it was found out that only the free energy ( largest eigenvalue ) of @xmath0 many - body potts model is equal to that of the @xmath1 many - body gmpc model , while the correlation lengths ( which depend on the second largest eigenvalue as well ) of two models differ significantly .",
    "the analysis presented above shows that a potts model with @xmath3 @xcite , formulated on the level of the effective free energy , is equivalent to the one - body gmpc model ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "since the zimm - bragg model has been shown as originating from the @xmath3 gmpc model @xcite , this means that in order to achieve at least the same level of description , the former approach should be extended to next - nearest neighbor , three - body , interactions .",
    "the characteristic equation of the lifson - roig model can be derived from gmpc model hamiltonian with three - body interactions @xcite , so that the potts model with @xmath112 would be necessary to get an equivalent free energy .",
    "it is worth noticing that the gmcp model is also related to another interesting model that has been frequently used in the framework of protein folding , namely the wako - saito - munoz - eaton ( wsme ) model @xcite . unlike the gmpc model , and quite similarly to the zimm - bragg model , the wsme model sets out from a phenomenological expression of the free energy .",
    "the methodology to pass from the gmpc hamiltonian model to the corresponding free energy has already been elucidated in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it turns out that the resulting free energy bears strong similarities with the corresponding wsme one  being in fact equivalent for finite range interactions , apart from an appropriate rescaling in the parameters .",
    "correlation lengths are , however , in general different for essentially the same reasons given in the present work for the potts model .",
    "as this point appears to be interesting , it will be the subject of a future dedicated analysis .    though the derivation of the secular equation of the many - body potts model is straightforward , it was not derived or analyzed before .",
    "interesting differences in the thermodynamic behavior appear once one of the spin values is preferred , as in the gmpc model . in the case",
    "when the isotropy of spins is broken in this way , the application of the gmpc model as opposed to the potts model seems to be more adequate , as shown explicitly for the example of the helix - coil transition .",
    "since a fruitful analogy between magnetic and polymer systems is well established and long known , we believe that there are likewise situations in the theory of magnetism , where application of the gmpc model instead of the standard potts model would lead to a more detailed understanding of the thermodynamic properties .",
