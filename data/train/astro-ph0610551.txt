    "we present here the final results of our survey for local group dwarf galaxies .",
    "these faint objects are heavily selected against in most surveys ( for obvious reasons ) , but are of disproportionate interest in many areas .",
    "their external kinematics provides clues to the origin and evolution of the local group , and internally they show signs of being dominated by dark matter .",
    "star formation proceeds in different ways among the various known examples , giving insight into the processes involved .",
    "the total census and luminosity function provide important contraints on cosmology and structure formation .",
    "for all these reasons , it is worthwhile both to find more examples , and to set quantitative limits on the completeness and sensitivity of any survey .",
    "the total number of known local group dwarfs prior to our survey was on the order of two dozen , which translates to a very small number per square degree on the sky .",
    "unless there were some great undiscovered population we were faced with the task of searching very large areas in order to have any reasonable chance of finding more . and since we are within the group , new members could appear in any direction .",
    "these considerations led to an all - sky effort . in turn , this meant we had to use photographic survey material , since no deep all - sky ccd survey yet exists .",
    "next came the task of extracting candidate objects from the plate material .",
    "the surveys have been digitized , so one could in principle devise an algorithm to pick out likely - looking objects ; and this has been done by some groups .",
    "however , at the very low signal levels we were interested in a great number of false detections would be found , each of which would have to be examined by eye anyway ; so we settled on a visual examination of the survey plates in the first place .",
    "it quickly became apparent that plate copies of the poss - ii and eso / src surveys were superior to film copies in freedom from processing defects which could mimic dwarf galaxies , so we confined ourselves exclusively to glass .",
    "( this did not turn out to mean a fainter limit on objects found ; see below . )",
    "the last consideration involved how to deal with the milky way .",
    "a simple cutoff at a given galactic latitude would be rather crude and might miss some dwarfs . on the other hand , low surface brightness galactic nebulosity extends very high in places ( we report knots of it at @xmath1 below ) . in the end we decided to examine the entire sky , since even in very extincted regions we might find ( for example ) new planetary nebulae which would be of interest to someone .",
    "the technique as implemented was to search all the 894 north and 894 south survey fields visually , for objects resembling the known andromeda dwarf spheroidals and tucana , that is of very low surface brightness and large ( one to several minutes of arc in size ) .",
    "in addition , any object which appeared to be resolving into faint stars was included . to screen out plate defects and reflection nebulae ,",
    "candidates were required to be on both red and blue copies of the field . at the same time , each field was rated as `` good '' ( no apparent galactic interference ) , `` troublesome '' ( galactic nebulosity present , but not covering the whole plate , averaging to something like 50% ) , or `` poor '' ( little or no freedom from the milky way ) to provide a rough estimate of galactic obscuration .",
    "a total of 338 real objects were listed from the plate examination .",
    "catalogs were consulted for these objects , and those which were known to be local group dwarfs , or not , set aside as non - candidates ( we provide a list of those below ) .",
    "follow - up observations were made of these objects using the 1.5 m at cerro tololo inter - american observatory , the 2.1 m at kitt peak national observatory , and the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope at observatorio del roque de los muchachos on the island of la palma .",
    "each was imaged in @xmath0 in sufficient depth to show the tip of the red giant branch at a nominal distace of 1 mpc .",
    "those objects which resolved into stars were also imaged in @xmath2 and @xmath3 to provide a color - magnitude diagram and thus a determination of distance .",
    "time sometimes allowed images also in narrowband h@xmath4 , to distinguish hii regions from stars and confirm the identification of emission nebulae .",
    "in all we had 206 candidates ( 134 north , 72 south ) and 132 non - candidates ( 92 north , 40 south ) . six objects in the north and six in the south could not be detected in follow - up observations ; this fact will be discussed below .",
    "there is clearly a strong asymmetry , amounting to a factor of two between the north and the south .",
    "this can not not be traced , as in much of astronomy , to a matter of historical development or to differences in equipment or techniques .",
    "we believe it to happen because a large number of local group dwarf candidates must actually be larger , more distant galaxies , but not _ much _ more distant ; they will be in nearby groups .",
    "there are simply more of these , and more populous ones , in the northern sky , plus of course the virgo cluster .",
    "observational data on local group dwarf galaxy candidates from the poss - ii survey are presented in table [ northcand ] and from the eso / src plates in table [ southcand ] .",
    "all data were derived from our follow - up observations .",
    "table [ southcand ] is an updated version of that published in @xcite , and where different supercedes that listing .",
    "objects selected on the plates but rejected as candidates for various reasons are listed in table [ northnon ] for the north and table [ southnon ] for the south .    the first column in each table",
    "is the adopted designation .",
    "we have used what seems to be the most popular designations ( though other choices could certainly be made ) . where no previous designation could be found , we have devised one according to the iau guidelines .",
    "we have not used designations based on non - visual catalogues ( for instance , iras point sources ) because the identity is not always certain . in cases of confusion ,",
    "the positions provide an unambiguous guide .",
    "positions are given for all objects in the 2000 equinox , and are accurate to 0.1 minute _ when the object morphology permits_. such an accuracy is clearly meaningless for an amorphous patch of galactic nebulosity several minutes wide , with no clear center or concentration .",
    "even for more limited and definable objects , like spheroidal galaxies , the low surface brightness and diffuse nature of our targets means that the centers are not always clearly defined to within 0.1 minute . in all cases",
    ", however , the position given falls well within the object and is quite adequate to center it in any subsequent field of view .",
    "sizes are those of the object as seen in the follow - up image . they are not rigorously determined ( for instance , size within a certain surface brightness limit ) but are included to provide a general indication of size .",
    "surface brightness was determined in the @xmath0 band according to a procedure which will be detailed below .",
    "the identification of the type of object is based on the morphology as seen in the follow - up @xmath0 image , sometimes with additional data from other bands or published sources .",
    "while most are fairly definite , some are certainly arguable and we do not pretend that our listing is infallible in all cases .",

    "we do this in two parts : first , by comparing three different data sets , we estimate the reliability of our survey ; that is , we estimate what fraction of the objects visible on the plates and meeting our selection criteria were actually detected .",

    "second , the peculiarities of a visual survey make it useful to separate the aspects , as will be seen below .      in an era of automatic algorithms working on",
    "electronically obtained and calibrated data the idea of a visual survey on photographic material appears almost quixotic .",
    "certainly photographic data are less well controlled than ccd data , especially if the former are in the form of an emulsion ( instead of a digital scan ) .",
    "however , less well controlled is not the same thing as uncontrolled .",
    "@xcite found that the plate - to - plate variation among 185 plates used in the apm galaxy survey ( southern sky ) amounted to 0.178 mag rms .",
    "we expect the consistency of the poss - ii plates to be similar , given that the various technologies involved were maintained or slightly improved in the meantime .",
    "the later northern survey is clearly of a lower quality in the number of plate defects , aircraft trails and the like ( reflecting both the enormous difference in the level of air travel over the south and the limited time available to take duplicates ) ; but while this increased the time spent chasing chimeras it does not really change the consistency of the photographic material .    the other part of the survey , detection of objects by the human eye ( with its very effective but rather complicated software ) , is a different operation from automatic routines and needs to be appreciated in a different way .",
    "the major difference lies in the fact that a human observer does not apply search criteria exactly and in a completely reproducible way .",
    "this means that an object which clearly matches the criteria and is well within any detectability threshold may be missed anyway .",
    "contrast this with an automatic function , which will _ always _ find ( say ) a round object ( ellipticity less than a given number ) standing ten sigma above the background .",
    "in addition , there will be a wide region at the edges of search criteria in which a visual survey may or may not include objects . the latter becomes especially important when dealing with the ( necessarily ) vague morphological criterion of looking `` like known dwarfs : diffuse and faint . ''      for various reasons of timing",
    ", 211 fields of the poss - ii survey were examined in 1997 and again in 2000 .",
    "this is certainly enough time ( and enough sky area ) to remove any memory of the first examination by the time of the second , so they may be considered to be independent looks at the same data .    as an initial comparison",
    "we look at the estimate of general galactic nebulosity . in terms of plate grading for milky way interference ,",
    "the numbers were + 1997 : good 124 , troublesome 42 , poor 13 ; + 2000 : good 132 , troublesome 26 , poor 21 ; + with a total of 32 fields changing grading by one column , up or down ( none by two ) . given the subjective nature of the grading , this is a very stable performance .",
    "more to the point , our adopted overall correction for milky way interference ( one - half of the troublesome fields plus all of the poor fields ) is identical .",
    "we now turn to the survey itself .",
    "to estimate the completeness of a survey , we assume a target population of some unknown number @xmath123 defined by our set of observational criteria , each of whose members the survey has an average probability @xmath124 of detecting and recording .",
    "these are the objects fitting our morphological criteria and visible on the plates .",
    "the number actually detected at one pass will be @xmath125 ; since neither quantity on the right is known , we can not calculate the other . on a second pass ( or with a different survey ) ,",
    "similarly , @xmath126 will be detected , allowing for the fact that the probability may change ; and of course the particular set of objects will differ in general , with an overlap of @xmath127 .",
    "if we assume the first set of detections @xmath128 is a random sample of the parent population , the probability of detection by the second survey is just @xmath129 .",
    "working backwards we can now calculate @xmath130 and @xmath123 .",
    "if the two probabilities are significantly different , we should start looking for systematic differences between the detected objects .",
    "looking at the number of candidate objects in this way , things are less encouraging than with the plate grading .",
    "36 were recorded both times ; 20 only in 1997 ; and 31 only in 2000 . taken at face value",
    ", it seems that an object matching our morphological criteria has slightly over half a chance , certainly not as much as two - thirds , of even being seen .",
    "but on a third examination of these fields we found that , of the 1997-only objects , 17 were really too bright and small to fit the criteria ; and of the 2000-only objects , 26 were actually too much like galactic nebulosity to be worth recording . what happens is this : in each examination we were anxious not to miss any true local group dwarfs , and so included many doubtful objects . between the two examinations",
    "there was a shift in which doubtful objects we were inclined to include .",
    "a second look at each candidate showed that many were clearly not of interest , and that we were choosing good candidates much more reliably . if we include only good objects we come up with a one - pass reliability approaching 90%",
    "this is probably optimistic , however , since it only compares one set of eyes with itself . to get a better comparison",
    "we need another set of eyes .",
    "we are aware of only one other survey comparable to ours , that is , which examined photographic material over the entire sky ( or a large fraction of it ) in seach of faint objects with the morphology of dwarf galaxies . as reported by @xcite , their results along with those of @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and @xcite covered 97% of the sky looking for dwarf galaxies in the local volume ( out to a few megaparsecs ) , using film copies of the eso / src and poss - ii plates .",
    "while their criteria were slightly different ( for example , they included objects down to half an arc minute in size , which of course reasonable if one is interested in things farther away than the local group ) they should have included our criteria as a subset .",
    "going through the lists of objects as published , taking only those larger than one minute along at least one axis and appearing on both the blue and red films , the situation again appears rather distressing .",
    "there is an overlap of 46 objects ; set against our candidate list of 194 , this gives the local volume group a chance of less than one - quarter of recording an object meeting our criteria . even if we confine ourselves to objects identified as extragalactic the local volume probability of detection only reaches about 36% .",
    "there are similarly something like 200 objects in their list which appear from the tables to match our criteria , but do not appear in ours , giving us a chance of less than one in five .",
    "it seems hardly likely that even a cursory visual survey would miss _ most _ of the objects it was looking for .",
    "again we turned our attention to the non - overlap region . visually examining the objects in the local volume list which nominally match our criteria , almost all are too small and/or too bright to look like",
    "local group dwarfs to us . when faced with an object close to a minute of arc in size on the survey field",
    ", we would tend to say it is smaller than the local volume group would report it ; and there are enough objects near the borderline to make a big difference in the numbers . the fact that all of these are very diffuse objects ,",
    "whose size is difficult to estimate anyway , only complicates matters . if we count up those objects which we did judge to meet our criteria , and include some borderline cases , we find 14 which we missed .",
    "this gives our group an estimated reliability ( conservatively ) of about 77% .",
    "( a similarly corrected number for the local volume survey is not available without asking them to review our candidate objects , clearly an unreasonable request . )",
    "we wish to make clear what is happening in this process : the human eye and judgement , when applying a set of morphological criteria corresponding to known local group dwarf galaxies to images , generates a fairly reliable ( 77% or maybe better ) list of those that fit .",
    "it will also ( probably to avoid missing anything important ) throw up a large number of doubtful cases .",
    "these can be rejected fairly easily by a second , independent examination .",
    "we may make an analogy with the classification of galaxies by eye , based on morphology : the majority will be assigned the same , or very similar , types by different workers ; but there is a population whose assigment will vary widely between surveys .",
    "seeking a way to check our completeness without dealing with the diffuse edges of morphology space , we turn to a sample which is very definitely made up of objects morphologically like local group dwarf galaxies : known local group dwarfs .",
    "we compared our local group detections in tables [ northcand ] through [ southnon ] with known and suspected local group galaxies ( defining them observationally , leaving aside such questions as whether the sextans a / b / ngc 3109 subgroup is actually bound to the local group ) .",
    "we found that pegasus ( ddo 210 ) , leo a ( ddo 69 ) , and phoenix , as well as anything brighter , were too bright for us to record .",
    "sextans is not visible on the survey plate , and so is outside our morphological criteria ; similarly for the recent detections andromeda ix and ursa major .",
    "ursa minor is visible , as are andromeda v and cassiopeia , but these were not recorded .",
    "we could argue that cassiopeia looks rather like a galactic nebula , and is found on a `` troublesome '' plate , so could be counted under the allowance for milky way obstruction ( see below ) ; but in the interests of a conservative estimate we include it .",
    "seventeen detections out of a total of twenty gives a detection probability of 85% , about midway between the previous figures of 77% and 90% .",
    "given the small numbers involved and the uncertainty in applying the morphological criteria , this is a remarkable level of agreement between three independent data sets .      using the lowest of the above figures along with the total of 20 for local group dwarf galaxies of the targeted type , we come up with an estimate of 26 for the total population .",
    "that implies that ( statistically ) six objects with similar properties are still waiting to be found .",
    "however , if we include the local volume survey and grant them the same probability of detection as ours , the joint probability of detection goes up to 95% , implying just one remaining undetected local group dwarf within our detection criteria .",
    "( this assumes that all the local volume objects have been followed up in enough detail to demonstrate that they are local group dwarfs , or not . from the sample of 14 objects referred to in the previous subsection ,",
    "nine can be ruled out from online data alone .",
    "we are looking into the situation on the remaining five . ) in practice we believe this to be a low estimate , since it does not take into account all the other groups which have looked at the sky in various ways .",
    "we conclude that it is unlikely , but would not be surprising , if there remained one local group dwarf galaxy sufficiently large and bright to appear on the survey plates , and not hidden by the milky way , which has not yet been found .",
    "two would be surprising ; a larger number is extremely unlikely .",
    "again we wish to emphasize the differences between a visual survey and one using automatic algorithms .",
    "first , there will be objects missed regardless of how easy they may be to find ; second , an effort not to miss something important will generate many doubtful candidates that on review should be discarded . in spite of the inherant fuzziness of such a survey its repeatability ( and hence completeness )",
    "can be characterized with some confidence , as the agreement of our three estimates shows .",
    "the important caveat to the previous section s conclusions is that the milky way covers a large part of the sky , and none of the objects we are looking for can be seen through galactic interference . to estimate the completeness of the local group census",
    "we must come up with an estimate of galactic sky coverage .",
    "a simple expression in galactic latitude is rather too crude ( especially in light of the significant cirrus found above @xmath131 ) . a sophisticated treatment involving optical extinction integrated over the sky would require effort disproportionate to the result we seek ( and to the uncertainties in the other assumptions we must make ) .",
    "instead , we have , as noted above , separated all survey fields into three grades .",
    "we assume that a local group dwarf would be seen over all of a `` good '' plate ; over half of a `` troublesome '' plate ; and not at all on a `` poor '' plate . from this procedure",
    "we estimate that 72.5% of the sky is clear of milky way obstruction .",
    "( for comparison , we note that @xcite estimate 67% of the sky as being free from galactic interference using an entirely different method , agreement well within our expected uncertainty . )    converting this to an estimate of the number of obscured galaxies involves other assumptions , particularly about the luminosity function in the local group .",
    "certainly the brightest galaxies would be seen even through much of the milky way , and gas - rich systems detected through ( for example ) hi observations , and so for them the 72.5% is too low . taking our 20 faint galaxies and adding , say , ten more from the known local group population ( which would be obscured , but were too bright to meet our search criteria ) ; and assuming an isotropic distribution , we come up with an estimated eleven galaxies in the obscured zone .",
    "if we take the extreme position that all of the `` troublesome '' plates are completely obscured , we have only 58% of the sky clear , and an estimated 22 hidden galaxies .",
    "this is an unlikely number ( we _ did _ find faint extragalactic objects on `` troublesome '' plates ) , best taken as an extreme upper limit .",
    "the estimate changes if the distribution of galaxies is not isotropic on the sky , of which there is some evidence , but it has not been clear whether the distribution is more concentrated toward the galactic plane , as found ( for instance ) by @xcite ; or less , in accordance with the venerable holmberg effect , most recently found in the results of @xcite .",
    "the latter found a preference for higher - latitude ( @xmath132 ) positions over lower ones in the ratio of 0.8 ; the former s results are a bit harder to put in the form we are looking for , but amount to something less than 1:1.5 .",
    "the work of @xcite confirmed the result of @xcite , showing an excess of satellite galaxies along the major axis reaching 20% and a similar deficit along the minor axis ; they also explain the discrepancy with @xcite as due to an ambiguity in defining the major axis angle on the sky , concluding that all three studies are in fact consistent .",
    "but they also found that , for blue central galaxies ( like the milky way ) , the effect disappears . in any case , the correction implied for the number of satellite galaxies hidden behind the galactic plane is no larger than the uncertainty in the number of satellites in the sky area lost due to galactic interference .",
    "we may get a first estimate of the faintness limit of our survey by comparing those local group dwarfs found and missed . according to the compilation of @xcite , draco ( which we found ) has @xmath133 ; ursa minor ( which is visible on the plate , but we did not notice ) has @xmath134 ; sextans , which is not visible , has @xmath135 .",
    "this indicates our limit is about @xmath136 . for galaxies such as andromeda ix @xcite , with @xmath137 , we had no chance . and",
    "while a surface brightness can be calculated for such objects as the canis major @xcite and sagittarius @xcite galaxies , such a figure is not observationally significant , since the dwarf galaxy s stars are lost among those of the milky way .",
    "( we are inclined to place them among the galaxies lost to milky way interference in the calculations of the previous section . )    for later use we would also like to place a bright limit on our survey . again comparing our list to that of @xcite",
    ", we find that objects at @xmath138 or brighter were always excluded ; a few tenths of a magnitude fainter , no object was excluded for being too bright .",
    "the matter is made uncertain by the lack of measurements on some galaxies , the large uncertainties on others , and the inclusion in our list of brighter objects that appeared to be resolving or on the verge of resolution , but a figure of about 23.3 is probably our best estimate .",
    "more important is a better estimate of the faint limit , especially given the large uncertainties in the numbers quoted . at the very least , a confirmation of the general figure of 25.5 by a different method is desirable .",
    "however , in trying to estimate the limits of sensitivity of our survey , as well as in trying to determine the nature of each candidate object , we run up against the nature of the follow - up observing .",
    "it was designed to answer one question for each object : is it a local group dwarf galaxy ?",
    "there was simply not sufficient telescope time for the multiband and multimode observations required to say for sure _ what _ each object is .",
    "neither were all data taken under the photometric conditions which would allow a precise measurement of brightness ; in fact true photometric conditions were rare .",
    "so we are faced with pressing into service data taken for another purpose .",
    "in addition , measuring surface brightness , especially of faint and diffuse objects , is difficult both in definition and in practice . for a large and complicated galactic nebula , for instance , where is the center ?",
    "if that can not be defined , then neither can one define a central surface brightness .",
    "if the object is not of some regular form , then the apparatus developed for comparing elliptical galaxies ( say ) is not of much use .    in spite of all this , it is possible to obtain some measurement of how faint an object the eye - plate combination could detect . to this end ,",
    "the flux within a section of each candidate was measured ( using the iraf routine polyphot ) , an area roughly one arc minute in diameter containing the brightest parts .",
    "stars were excluded as much as possible ( which was difficult near the galactic plane ) , as were the bright nuclei of face - on galaxies ( which appear starlike on the plates ) .",
    "the intention was to measure as closely as possible what the eye responded to in the survey field .",
    "then two ( sometimes more ) sections of blank sky were likewise measured , trying to bracket the object sideways to the remaining flat - field gradients ; these were averaged and subtracted from the object flux .",
    "the counts per pixel were transformed into magnitudes per square arc second using photometric solutions derived from landolt standards taken the same night .",
    "an uncertainty was derived using both the variation in the sky readings and the uncertainty in the photometric solution .",
    "the sky subtraction dominated most measurements , even on non - photometric nights . in several cases",
    "the same object was measured on different runs ; the results agree to within our stated errors , though it was clear that the uncertainties are not overstated .",
    "the measurements were all done in @xmath0 , because only in that band do we have data on all objects .",
    "this is a result of looking for the tip of the red giant branch , which is easiest to detect there .",
    "unfortunately , most surface brightness estimates and measurements are given in @xmath2 ; this must be borne in mind when making comparisons .",
    "the combined histogram for all candidate objects is shown in figure [ total ] .",
    "clearly we are reliably detecting things out to about 24 mag arc sec@xmath119 . the reduction in number per brightness bin beyond that point",
    "could be interpreted as the onset of incompleteness , though if we re seeing a significant number fainter than 25 it s hard to understand why we would be missing many a full magnitude brighter . in order to transform the graph into something quantitative , we need some model for the underlying distribution of surface brightness .",
    "( if we were dealing with _ total _",
    "brightness we could apply geometric arguments , but for the distances we are dealing with , surface brightness is constant . )",
    "while these do exist for galaxies , modelling such a thing for galactic nebulosity is a daunting thought .",
    "for this reason we plot the two classes of object separately in figure [ gal_xgal ] .    here",
    "the peak and faint - end falloff of the galactic nebulosities are clearly fainter than the corresponding features for extragalactic objects .",
    "this indicates that much of the decrease between , say , 24 and 25 magnitudes is real , a feature of the underlying population , and not due to a declining sensitivity in our survey at these levels .",
    "before we look at the extragalactic data in more detail , however , there is an observational matter to check into .    while processing the data we noticed an asymmetry between the northern and southern objects in surface brightness , and so we plot them separately in figure [ northsouth ] .",
    "here is a very clear trend : the northern histogram tends a full magnitude fainter at the faint end .",
    "what could possibly cause such an effect ?",
    "the eso / src and poss - ii surveys used essentially the same emulsions and similar exposure times .",
    "the schmidt cameras involved were not identical , but none of the differences should amount to anything like a full magnitude ( and most probably the brightness of the night sky was the most important limiting factor in any case ) .",
    "it is highly unlikely that there is such a marked relative lack of the very faintest objects in the southern hemisphere of a few arc minutes in size .    but consider the follow - up telescopes themselves .",
    "the ctio 1.5 m was operated at f/13.5 , while the kpno 2.1 m was used at f/7.5 .",
    "a faster system will record fainter diffuse objects in a given span of time ; even taking into account the shorter exposure times used in the north , the 2.1 m should theoretically have an advantage of a factor of 2.4 , or about one magnitude , exactly as appears here .",
    "( the isaac newton telescope , used for a few of the northern objects , has characteristics similar to the kpno 2.1 m ) .",
    "the faint limit of the histograms here presented is due to the follow - up observations , which did not reach as faint ( in surface brightness ) as the original plate material .",
    "this also accounts for the twelve objects found on the plates but not seen in the follow - up images : they are diffuse , and too faint for the relatively slow telescopes to record .",
    "( they are not local group dwarfs , or we would have seen red giant stars in them . )",
    "our histograms are thus a combination of ( i ) the original distribution of galaxies by surface brightness , @xmath139 ; ( ii ) galactic extinction ; ( iii ) the selection function of the eye - plate combination , @xmath140 ; and the selection function of the follow - up telescopes , @xmath141 and @xmath142 . in addition , as we get to fainter levels the number of objects diminishes greatly , adding to the uncertainty of the statistics .",
    "the mixture looks unpromising , but with some plausible assumptions we can make a bit more progress .",
    "we express the observed number of objects per bin in the northern sample as the product of some total number , the original distribution as modified by galactic extinction and the plate - eye selection function , and the telescope selection function : @xmath143 with a similar expression for the south .",
    "now we assume that @xmath144 is the same in the north and the south , and that the selection function for the 2.1 m has the same form as that for the 1.5 m , only displaced by a certain amount .",
    "( this displacement could in principle be determined from the data , but not very reliably given the small numbers involved , and in any case the inaccuracy of the original measurements argues against trying to be too precise",
    ". we will take it to be one magnitude . )",
    "we may now write an iterative expression for the telescope selection functions : @xmath145 we probably do not know the ratio of total numbers well at this faint end of the function , so we will leave them as a normalization constant to be determined . taking only extragalactic objects ,",
    "their histograms are shown in figure ( [ nsraw ] ) .",
    "we are clearly going to have trouble with the small number of objects per bin .",
    "we will take two measures to deal with that : first , smooth the data with a three - bin running top hat ( either before or after carrying out the division ) ; second , demand that the selection function be flat at brighter magnitudes ( as long as an object is bright enough , it should be seen ) and monotonically declining thereafter .",
    "the ratio of southern to northern objects fluctuates in the bins from 23.0 to about 23.6 magnitudes per square arc second , depending on the smoothing ; partly this is due to small - number statistics , but possibly also due to a somewhat ragged bright limit on our candidates . at 23.8 to 24.0",
    "it steadies , and declines thereafter .",
    "we take this to indicate that there is no brightness - dependent selection effect due to the 1.5 m up to 24.0 , and so none for the 2.1 m up to 25.0 .",
    "the next step is to apply our derived function to a set of observed data and reconstruct , as far as we can , the histogram due to the original brightness distribution and the eye - and - plate selection function .    as noted by the referee ,",
    "our measured surface brightnesses include galactic extinction",
    ". this would not be important for our purposes if it affected all objects impartially .",
    "unfortunately , we find ( using extinction measures from @xcite via ned ) that the more heavily extincted objects tend to be brighter .",
    "this makes sense : a faint object will be harder to find in a region of high extinction because of confusion with bright galactic nebulosity .",
    "we could in principle correct for this effect statistically , but the small number of objects we have would make such a correction very uncertain . instead , we simply omit those objects whose extinction is larger than the uncertainty in their measured surface brightness .",
    "this is equivalent to confining our analysis to areas of the sky well clear of the milky way .",
    "we now take the extragalactic northern objects , minus those with high extinction , and apply a three - bin running top hat smoothing . at the 25.0 magnitudes per square arc second bin and fainter we apply a correction for the 2.1 m selection function .",
    "the result is shown in figure ( [ tophat ] ) .",
    "there is a shallow rise to a maximum between 24.0 and 24.5 , a drop thereafter , then a rise again to the limit of the follow - up observations .",
    "the reconstruction of the faint end , as shown by the two methods involved , is uncertain .",
    "but it is clear that , since the 2.1 m showed any objects at all , there must be several detected by the eye - and - plate method .",
    "it is in this tail , we suggest , that the objects not detected by follow - up imaging lie .    to work out specifically the selection function of the eye - plate combination , even as far as the limitations of follow - up observations allow , requires a knowledge of the actual ( surface brightness ) luminosity function .",
    "unfortunately , it is simply not known for galaxies this faint . if there is a sudden great increase in the number of objects fainter than 24.5 or 25 magnitudes per square arc second in @xmath0 our sensitivity there could be low indeed .",
    "but we note that both @xcite and @xcite have the surface brightness luminosity function actually falling at their faint limits . since we go deeper than either study it is certainly not impossible for there to be such a faint upturn , but it would require some fine - tuning to have it cut in at just the least convenient point .    the quantitative shape of figure ( [ tophat ] ) should not be taken too seriously .",
    "as we have noted , our data are relatively inaccurate and sparse , especially at the faint end .",
    "however , we believe our overall result is robust : if the actual surface brightness distribution of galaxies is not rising rapidly faintward of 25 , and extrapolation of current information has it indeed falling , then the combination of photographic survey plates and visual examination retains most of its sensitivity out to 25.5 magnitudes per square arc second in @xmath0 .",
    "from our survey we conclude that the current list of local group dwarf galaxies is essentially complete for objects brighter than some limit between 25 and 26 magnitudes per square arc second in @xmath0 and larger than about a minute of arc over 72.5% of the sky .",
    "( in total luminosity , 26 mag sec@xmath119 over a one - minute diameter translates to @xmath146 at a distance of 1 mpc .",
    "we do _ not _ claim an absolute magnitude limit on our survey , however . )",
    "there may remain one more ( improbably two ) to be found . concealed behind the milky way we estimate another dozen ; due to the uncertainty about the luminosity function and spatial distribution of concealed galaxies this number is uncertain , but unlikely to be as high as twenty .",
    "our survey was not capable of detecting all known local group galaxies .",
    "those whose stars must be picked out from the field individually , such as sextans , sagittarius and andromeda ix , were invisible to us . on the other hand",
    ", we did see many resolving objects near the milky way .",
    "the requirement is for some perceptible increase in surface brightness ( possibly in the form of a stellar overdensity ) above the surrounding field .",
    "we note in particular that compact star clusters of the type recently reported by @xcite , if there were any significant number associated with the milky way , would have been seen and recorded . in that way and in others",
    "the satellite galaxy systems of andromeda and the milky way must differ intrinsically , since the observed differences can not now be attributed to selection effects .    for many years the discrepancy between n - body simulations , which predict hundreds of galaxies in structures like the local group , and the much smaller number of known galaxies has been noted .",
    "the simulations of @xcite , for instance , predict 300 satellite galaxies within 1.5 mpc of the center of a local group - like structure , an order - of magnitude disagreement `` unless a large fraction of the local group satellites has been missed . ''",
    "if that caveat is understood to mean that observationally accessible galaxies ( that is , those detectable over a large fraction of the sky in observations available at the time the statement was made ) had been somehow overlooked , it can now be removed .",
    "the `` missing satellite problem '' persists in more recent simulations @xcite .",
    "a popular suggestion to deal with it involves reionization , which would make the conversion of small dark matter haloes into visible galaxies much more difficult .",
    "@xcite found that such a prescription allowed agreement between observed and simulated local group data for a large range of luminosities , producing a `` large population of faint satellites . . .",
    "awaiting discovery . '' in their simulation , the number of satellite galaxies brighter than 22 magnitudes per square arc second ( in @xmath2 ) roughly matches observation ; when the limit was lowered to 26 , the number increased to 200 . no numbers for intermediate levels",
    "are given , but certainly the number per brightness bin must increase as one goes fainter , something we have shown does not happen . at any rate",
    ", we have reached past 25 in @xmath0 ; for the galaxies made of old stars such as @xcite constructed this is most of the way to 26 in @xmath2 .",
    "their `` large population '' is simply not there .",
    "( note also that the detailed star formation histories of local group dwarfs appears to be inconsistent with supression by reionization @xcite ) .",
    "another suggestion ( both of these are found in @xcite , though not original there ) is that small dark matter haloes were never able to form a significant number of stars , retaining their baryonic matter in the form of atomic hydrogen , and that these have been detected as high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) . aside from the fact that no stars or other optical signal have been identified with a hvc ( for instance , @xcite )",
    ", it appears that the hvcs are too small and nearby to be identified with the missing dark halos , since any corresponding system should be visible in nearby groups and is nt there @xcite .",
    "the implications of our survey limit go beyond simple numbers of galaxies .",
    "@xcite identify a possible incompleteness in the census of milky way satellites beyond about 110 kpc . within that distance",
    "the faintest known galaxies can be found through identifying their individual stars . beyond ,",
    "if the limit for detection of diffuse objects is 24 - 25 magnitudes per square arc second ( their source for this figure and the applicable waveband are not given ) , some unknown fraction of satellites would not be seen .",
    "if this incompleteness exists , the radial distribution of milky way satellites could be the same as that of m31 satellites ( and simulations ) .",
    "now , however , with a limit of somewhere beyond 25 , we can say that this possible incompleteness is not there .",
    "we were sensitive enough to detect all but a handful of known local group dwarfs , and those are more or less evenly divided between m31 and the milky way .",
    "the radial distribution of milky way satellites _ is _ different from that of m31 satellites and simulations .    as this paper was in the refereeing stage several new objects even smaller and fainter than andromeda ix",
    "were reported @xcite .",
    "it is too early yet to draw any conclusions about their implications for the missing satellite problem .",
    "if they are indeed the first of many ( say , 100 or more ) galaxies _ and _ their dark - matter masses are of the same order as those of much brighter satellites , the problem is solved ( or at least transformed into a star - formation puzzle ) . if not , the problem persists .    this work has benefited greatly from a wide variety of sources .",
    "partial funding support was received from the intitute of astronomy of the university of cambridge , the physics department of the u. s. naval academy , the european southern observatory , and two american astronomical society small research grants ( which last funds originated with nasa ) .",

    "the results are based on observations made with the isaac newton telescope , operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias ; and at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) and kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",
