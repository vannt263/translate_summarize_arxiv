    "in 1973 , nielsen and olesen proposed a theoretical model comprised by higgs and gauge fields , that produces linear topological defect carrying a magnetic flux named ` vortex ' @xcite .",

    "coupling the energy - momentum tensor associated with the system to the einstein equations , he found static cylindrically symmetric solutions .",
    "the author also showed that , asymptotically , the spacetime around the vortex is a minkowski one minus a wedge .",
    "the core of the vortex has a nonzero thickness and a magnetic flux through it .",
    "two years later , linet @xcite obtained exact solutions for the complete set of differential equations , for some specific conditions .",
    "the author showed that the structure of the respective spacetime corresponds to a conical one , with the conicity parameter being expressed in terms of the energy per unit length of the vortex .",
    "the cosmic strings are among the most important class of linear topological defects with the conical geometry outside the core @xcite .",
    "the formation of this type of topologically stable structures during the cosmological expansion is predicted in most interesting models of high energy physics .",
    "they have a number of interesting observable consequences , the detection of which would provide an important link between cosmology and particle physics . in the eighties of last century ,",
    "the interest to cosmic strings was mainly due to the fact that they provide a mechanism for the large - scale structure formation in the universe which is alternative to the one based on inflationary paradigm . though the recent observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation have ruled out the scenario in which the cosmic strings seed the primordial density perturbations , they are sources of a number of interesting effects which include the generation of gravitational waves , high energy cosmic rays , and gamma ray bursts . among the other signatures of the cosmic strings , we mention here the gravitational lensing , the creation of small non - gaussianities in the cosmic microwave background and the influence on the corresponding tensor - modes .",
    "the recent progress in models with large compact dimensions and large warp factors have shown that the fundamental strings can act as cosmic strings .",
    "in particular , a new formation mechanism for cosmic strings is proposed in the framework of brane inflation @xcite .",

    "in addition to the deficit angle parameter , the physical origin of a cosmic string is characterized by the gauge field flux parameter describing a magnetic flux running along the string core .",
    "the latter induces additional polarization effects for charged fields @xcite-@xcite .",
    "though the gauge field strength vanishes outside the string core , the nonvanishing vector potential leads to aharonov - bohm - like effects on scattering cross sections and on particle production rates around the cosmic string alfo89 .    for charged fields , the magnetic flux along the string core induces nonzero vacuum expectation value of the current density .",
    "the latter , in addition to the expectation values of the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor , is among the most important local characteristics of the vacuum state for quantum fields .",

    "the generalization of the corresponding results for the fermionic case to a cosmic string in the background of de sitter spacetime is given in @xcite .",

    "the expectation value for the particles and antiparticles in the case @xmath201 is the corresponding quantity in the absence of the planar angle deficit and the magnetic flux .",
    "the charge density is an even periodic function of the magnetic flux with period equal to the quantum flux .",
    "for the zero chemical potential the contributions from the particles and antiparticles cancel each other and the total charge density , given by ( [ j0 ] ) , vanishes .",
