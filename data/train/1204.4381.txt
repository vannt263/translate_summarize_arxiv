    "high mass loss during the agb phase is one of the main contributors to the return of nucleo - synthesized material into the interstellar medium .",
    "a proper understanding of agb mass loss is thus crucial for the study of the chemical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "however , the exact mechanism or mechanisms responsible for the agb mass loss is still not clear . after the agb phase , the star evolves towards the planetary nebula ( pn ) phase . during this transition ,",
    "fast winds are launched that interact with the earlier circumstellar envelope ( cse ) that was created during the agb . a large fraction of pne",
    "are observed to be aspherical , and the origin of the asphericity is attributed to the influence of a binary companion , a disk , a magnetic field , or a combination of these .",
    "the exact onset of asphericity is still unknown , and high angular resolution molecular line observations indicate that several cses of agb stars already display various degrees of asymmetry .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the creation of asymmetries is likely closely linked with that driving the mass loss and can be directly probed by high angular resolution observations of cses . in particular molecular line polarization observations",
    "are a unique tool to study potential asymmetries in the cse and/or determine the shape of the circumstellar magnetic field .",
    "the critical role of magnetic fields in star formation has been probed with direct observations of polarized dust continuum emission toward both low and high - mass star - forming regions @xcite .",
    "similar techniques are difficult to apply for agb stars due to the need for extremely high angular resolution ( @xmath1 ) and high sensitivity .",
    "a large number of studies have already been made of the magnetic field induced polarization of maser lines .",
    "these studies have revealed magnetic fields are present throughout the entire envelope .",
    "the sio , h@xmath2o and oh maser observations indicate that magnetic fields appear well ordered and the zeeman splitting indicates the field strengths range from several gauss close to the stellar surface to several mg at a few thousand au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , masers probe only a limited number of lines of sight through the cse and in most cases it is thus impossible to fully reconstruct the magnetic field morphology throughout the envelope .",
    "furthermore , the most abundant masers are predominantly found around oxygen - right ( m - type ) limiting the available source sample .",
    "non - masing molecular lines are however also predicted to be linearly polarized ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the level of a few percent , and can provide more extensive probes of the entire envelope .",

    "the molecular line polarization is due to the anisotropic radiation field from the central star imparting angular momentum on the molecules or from anisotropic level populations in the molecular magnetic substates when coupled with a magnetic field . without a ( non - radial ) magnetic field , and assuming a spherically symmetric stellar wind",
    ", linear polarization should be radial or tangential and should only be detectable at lines of sight away from the central star @xcite .",
    "thus , when these criteria are not met , molecular line polarization provides a unique diagnostic of magnetic field morphology and potential non - radial asymmetries in the stellar radiation field .",
    "very recently , @xcite have reported the detection of co polarized emission toward ik tau .",
    "irc+10216 ( cw leo ) is a well studied agb star with a high mass - loss rate , @xmath3  m@xmath4 yr@xmath5 , and a terminal velocity of 15  km  s@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "due to the relatively close distance of 150 pc @xcite , this star provides an ideal laboratory for studies of circumstellar chemistry @xcite . unlike typical mira variables ,",
    "there are no masers associated with this source , except perhaps a transition of sis which may be a weak maser @xcite .",
    "the dusty envelope of irc+10216 shows arc - like structures in scattered light @xcite which extend over more than 1@xmath6 in angular radius .",

    "non - spherical structures were also revealed in linear polarization maps produced by dust scattering at @xmath8 resolution in h band @xcite .",
    "a previous polarization detection in irc+10216 was reported by @xcite for the cs 21 line . in this letter",
    ", we present the detection of the linear polarized emission for the co  32 sis  1918  and cs  76  lines in irc+10216 .",
    "this is the first time that maps of the linear polarized emission in irc+10216  are presented .",
    "the sma observations were taken on 2010 november 24 in the compact configuration .",
    "the receiver was tuned to cover the 330.6 - 334.5 and 342.6 - 346.5  ghz frequencies in the lower ( lsb ) and upper side band , ( usb ) respectively .",
    "the phase center of the telescope was ra(j2000.0)@xmath9 and dec(j2000.0)@xmath10 .",
    "the correlator provided a spectral resolution of about 0.8  mhz ( i.e. , 0.7  km  s@xmath5 at 345  ghz ) .",
    "the gain calibrators were qsos j0854 + 201 and j1058 + 015 .",
    "the bandpass and polarization calibrator was 3c454.3 , which was observed in a parallactic angle range of @xmath11 .",
    "the absolute flux scale was determined from observations of titan .",
    "the flux uncertainty was estimated to be @xmath12% .",
    "the data were reduced using the miriad software package @xcite .",
    "the sma conducts polarimetric observations by cross correlating orthogonal circularly polarizations ( cp ) .",
    "the cp is produced by inserting quarter wave plates in front of the receivers which are inherently linearly polarized .",
    "a detailed description of the instrumentation techniques as well as calibration issues is discussed in @xcite and @xcite . in order to obtain a more accurate polarization calibration ,",
    "we solve for the leakage solution independently for the strongest detected lines ( co and @xmath13co 32 , h@xmath13cn 32 , cs 76 and sis 1918 ) by selecting a frequency range of @xmath14  ghz centered within 0.1  ghz with respect to the rest frequency of each line .",
    "we found polarization leakages between 1 and 2% for the usb , while the lsb leakages were between 2 and 4% .",
    "these leakages were measured to an accuracy of 0.1% .",
    "self - calibration was performed independently for the usb and lsb on the continuum emission of irc+10216 .",
    "all maps were done with natural weighting in order to maximize the sensitivity , which yielded a synthesized beam of @xmath15 with a position angle of pa@xmath16 ( see caption of figure  [ figmappol ] for more specific values ) .",
    "significant polarization was only detected in the co 32 , cs 76 and sis 76 lines , so this paper presents and discuss the detection significance for these three lines .",
    "figure  [ figspecpol ] shows the stokes @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 obtained at the positions of maximum polarized intensity for the co  32 , cs  76  and sis  1918  lines .",
    "figure  [ figmappol ] shows the polarization maps for the emission of these lines averaged over the velocity range that maximizes the polarized emission , which is different for each line .",
    "the co 3 - 2 lines is the strongest line detected in our observations ( the line is 50% brighter than the other two lines in the shortest baselines of the visibility plane ) .",
    "this line emission is known to be spatially very extended , much beyond the primary beam of the sma antennas @xcite .",
    "however the sma filters out the co emission that arises from structures larger than about @xmath20 @xcite , so the detected emission appears relatively compact .",
    "indeed , the co averaged emission over the blueshifted component shown in fig .",
    "[ figmappol ] has a relatively compact component ( with a radius of @xmath21 ) , surrounded by a weak components that extends up @xmath22 from the center at an intensity level of about 5% of the maximum .",
    "the cs and sis show also a compact component with similar dimensions , but they lack the weaker and extended component .",
    "the stokes _ i _   emission of the 3 lines has a similar brightness , @xmath23  k for the cs and sis and 150  k for co.    the @xmath24 noise of the stokes _ q _  and _ u _  emission appears to slightly increase in the channels where the line emission is brightest .",
    "this effect is seen in the three lines , though at different levels , from a maximum increase of 5% , 13% and 20% for the cs , sis and co lines , respectively .",
    "this increase is probably produced by the residual leakage ( estimated to be of @xmath25% , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the total intensity is very strong in the central channels .",
    "the larger increase for the co may be due because it is the most extended and the brightest line ( specially the shortest baselines ) .",
    "taking into account this increase of noise , there is still significant emission in the stokes @xmath18 and @xmath19 maps of the sis at the @xmath26-@xmath27 level , and in co and cs lines at the @xmath28-@xmath27 level .",
    "the linear polarization maps were computed by using a 3-@xmath27 cutoff , where @xmath27 is the rms noise in the map where the polarization is detected .",
    "the co linear polarization arises from both the _ u _  and _ q _  components , being relatively bright in the later .",
    "the cs and sis lines show mainly polarized emission in the _ u _  component .",
    "interestingly , the polarized emission in the three lines appears to be blueshifted with respect to the total intensity .    in order to derive the polarization pattern in the plane of the sky ,",
    "we have computed polarization maps with the emission averaged over the velocity range where the polarization intensity is detected ( see figure  [ figmappol ] ) .",
    "the polarization degree at the position where it is strongest is of @xmath29% for the co and sis lines , and of @xmath30% for the cs .",
    "the co  32  polarization arises from two spots , one at the center of irc+10216 and the other located @xmath31 to the east .",
    "the polarization vectors are oriented roughly north - south , changing slightly from a position angle of @xmath32 at the eastern spot , to @xmath33 at the central spot .",
    "the sis  1918  polarized emission arises mainly from the north - eastern quadrant of the irc+10216  envelope ( the polarization peak is located @xmath34 from the center s envelope ) .",
    "there are two other small spots , with a polarized emission too marginal to be further considered here .",
    "the polarization of the main component has a mean position angle of about @xmath35 , but the pattern of the polarization vectors appear to form an arc , following roughly the contours of the stokes _ i _  emission .",
    "the cs  76  polarization arises from the envelope s south - western quadrant ( the polarization peak is located @xmath36 from the center s envelope ) .",
    "the polarization @xmath37 pattern is quite uniform with an averaged value of @xmath38 .",
    "the sis polarization vectors pattern suggest a radial distribution .",
    "therefore , we have compared the polarization vector direction with the expected radial direction ( with respect to the envelope center ) at the position the vectors .",
    "figure  [ paradial ] shows the difference between the polarization vectors and the radial directions . on one hand ,",
    "the sis polarization vectors are all almost perpendicular to the radial direction , i.e. , they form a nearly perfect concentric arc - like pattern with respect to the envelope s center . on the other hand and despite the low polarization statistics , this is not the case for the co and cs polarization vectors .",
    "the detailed analysis of population of the magnetic sub - levels in rotational lines show that the highest polarized emission is expected for volume densities similar to the critical density of the observed transition , and depending on the transition and on the molecule , the polarization can still be significant even at densities ten times higher @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the polarization detected in the co  32  line should arise at volume densities of @xmath39  @xmath40 , so at the outer regions of the shell , whereas the the sis  1918  and cs  76  polarization is expected to trace inner regions , at densities of @xmath41  @xmath40 .",
    "one of the interesting features is that in the three lines the linear polarization is blueshifted with respect to the total emission ( this effect is more significant in the sis line ) . considering that the envelope is expanding ,",
    "this suggest that the polarized emission is being detected at the side of a shell facing us and with the aforementioned volume densities .",
    "in addition , most of the polarized emission arises about @xmath42 offset ( @xmath0  au in projection ) of the envelope s center . thus the optical depth is probably playing an important role . indeed ,",
    "subarcsecond resolution maps in the ir @xcite and hcn 32 emission @xcite show that the molecular distribution is asymmetrical .",
    "this suggests the anisotropy in the radiation field to be a cause for the polarization pattern to be not distributed spherically .",
    "this is also in agreement with the single - dish detection of the cs 21 line polarization towards the center of irc+10216 , which suggests that there is a non - radial polarization pattern  @xcite .    in circumstellar envelopes and for mm molecular lines",
    "the zeeman splitting is much larger than the collision and spontaneous rates , even for magnetic fields strength of only few @xmath43 g .",
    "therefore , the polarization should be aligned parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "an overall radial magnetic field is expected if it is weak enough to be energetically irrelevant , i.e. , the magnetic energy is significantly smaller than the mechanical energy of the stellar wind : @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the mass loss rate , @xmath46 the terminal velocity , @xmath47 the distance of irc+10216  and @xmath48 the angular radius @xcite . using the measured values in irc+10216",
    "( see   [ intro ] ) and at the distance where the polarization is detected ( @xmath31 , 450  au ) , this condition is satisfied if @xmath49  mg . cn zeeman splitting observations in irc+10216  indicate a strength of @xmath50  mg at a larger distance ( 2500 au , * ? ? ?",
    "for a solar - type and toroidal magnetic field configuration ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the expected strength where the polarization is detected would be in the 50 to 300 mg range .",
    "therefore , the magnetic field is strong enough to not be radially shaped by the wind",
    ".    the measured polarized vectors can be either parallel or perpendicular to the projected magnetic field direction in plane - of - the - sky @xcite . a proper radiative transfer analysis and a model of the physical conditions of the envelope ( including the magnetic field configuration )",
    "is needed to solve for this degeneracy .",
    "this applies for the measured co and cs polarization maps .",
    "nevertheless , in the region where the sis polarization is detected , the polarization pattern is indicative of a radial magnetic field ( see fig .  [ paradial ] ) .",
    "theoretical studies show that in an expanding circumstellar envelope with a radial magnetic field , the polarization will be parallel ( or perpendicular ) to the radial direction if it arises at radii lower ( or higher ) than at certain impact parameter , @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "@xmath53 is the radius where the spontaneous emission rate for the @xmath54 transition is equal to the ir absorption rate . according to @xcite , in irc+10216  the value of @xmath55 for the sis 21 line is @xmath56  cm .",
    "the spontaneous emission rate increases with j as @xmath57 , and the ir absorption rate goes as @xmath58 , so @xmath59  cm .",
    "the region where sis  1918  polarization is detected arises at a radius of @xmath60  cm from the star .",
    "therefore the sis  1918  polarization pattern is in agreement with the theoretical predictions if the magnetic field is radial in the region where sis the polarization is detected .    in summary ,",
    "we have detected and mapped the polarization pattern for the first time in irc+10216 , through spectro - polarimetric observations of the co  32 , sis  1918   and cs  76  lines .",
    "although , the data obtained so far lack the sensitivity to allow us to make specific predictions on the magnetic configuration of the irc+10216envelope , the polarization pattern measured discards that the magnetic field configuration has a global radial pattern ( this is only observed locally where the sis  1918  polarization is detected ) , but it possibly has a rather complex magnetic field morphology .",
    "in addition , the polarization detection in three different molecular lines implies that with the higher sensitivity and angular resolution that the atacama large millimeter array is going to provide , it would be possible to carry out spectro - polarimetric observations for a tomographic imaging of the magnetic field in circumstellar envelopes .",
    "however , the ambiguity between the polarization direction with respect to the magnetic field direction , implies that in order to properly relate the polarization pattern with the magnetic field , a complete radiative transfer analysis should be made .",
