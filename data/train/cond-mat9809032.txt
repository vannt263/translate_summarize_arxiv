    "the recent discovery of several families of new materials , @xcite such as @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 , where the spin chains are coupled in a special way to form ladders , gave a new impetus to the study of the properties of low dimensional magnetic system .",
    "this field was already intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically in the last decade due to a large extent to the proposal by haldane @xcite that antiferromagnetic spin chains described by an isotropic heisenberg model develop a gap in their excitation spectrum for integer spin , while for half - integer spin the spectrum is gapless .",
    "the spin - ladder models , beside their relevance to these materials , are of special interest for theorists @xcite because by appropriate choice of the couplings they can describe both spin-1/2 and effective spin-1 models , and they are also related to the models proposed to understand the behavior of the so - called high-@xmath5 materials .",
    "experimental studies @xcite confirm , that two - leg ladders behave like integer - spin models and have finite gap , while materials with three - leg ladders have gapless magnetic excitation spectrum .",
    "a particular way to construct ladder models is to put a composite spin on every site of a single chain and to couple the individual spins in various ways .",
    "@xcite this model has already been studied numerically using the lanczos algorithm to calculate the low - lying energy levels .",
    "this method could , however , be applied to relatively short chains only , and therefore the conclusions were sometimes contradictory .",
    "recently white @xcite has proposed a new procedure , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method that allows to calculate the energy of low - lying levels and related physical quantities on much longer chains .",
    "this led to a great progress in the application of the finite - size scaling method and allowed to investigate more complex systems in a larger parameter space .",
    "a natural extension of the usual heisenberg model of spin chains for @xmath6 is to include higher order polynomials of the bilinear exchange term . in the spin-1 case , where biquadratic exchange can be taken into account ,",
    "generically the spectrum remains massive , @xcite but at some special values of the couplings @xcite the gap might disappear and the model can be studied by bethe s ansatz .",
    "the opening of the gap around these critical integrable points is , however , not quite settled .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the earlier calculations on the composite - spin model to longer chains using the dmrg procedure , and to clarify the phase diagram of the corresponding ladder model .",
    "the setup of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give a short description of the composite - spin and ladder models and their relationship to the integrable models for appropriate choices of the parameters . the dmrg method and the numerical procedures",

    "@xmath25 is the usual coupling between spins on the same rung , @xmath26 couples spins on neighboring rungs of the legs , while @xmath27 describes four - spin couplings on a plaquette .",
    "usually the ladder models are constructed to include @xmath24 and @xmath25 only . when a strong ferromagnetic coupling is applied across the rungs @xmath28 , the two spins form a triplet and the properties of the @xmath11 heisenberg chain",

    "this relationship reduces to a usual duality relationship , which connects the energies in the @xmath42 region to those in @xmath43 , @xmath44    when @xmath45 , the above deduced duality relationship connects the lowest - lying levels of one region to the highest - lying levels in the other region . since in the numerical calculations a few low - lying levels",
    "can only be calculated with sufficient precision , a more useful relation can be derived in this case by comparing the energies of @xmath46 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : comp1 ] ) with @xmath47 to that of @xmath48 . denoting by @xmath49 the energies of this model , @xmath50 we used these relations to check the accuracy of the numerical calculations .    according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : compbiq ] ) the spin-1 model can be reproduced when @xmath24 and @xmath26 are taken with equal coupling strength , @xmath51 .",
    "when this coupling is antiferromagnetic , it gives rise to a valence - bond configuration @xcite of the neighboring spins , which is a characteristic feature of the haldane phase .",
    "when no direct coupling exists between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 spins , nothing ensures a priori that these spins appear in the symmetric @xmath11 configuration only .",
    "when , however , @xmath52 and @xmath30 are small compared to @xmath51 , the level structure of the true spin-1 model and that of the composite - spin model is such that their low - lying parts coincide , thus their behavior is similar",
    ". therefore the phase diagram of our ladder model will contain phases characteristic to the bilinear - biquadratic model , but also new phases may appear .    the normalization @xmath40 is equivalent to considering the region @xmath53 only .",
    "the bilinear - biquadratic model has a rich phase structure in that region .",
    "it has been thoroughly investigated both analytically @xcite by using , e.g. , the mapping to the wess - zumino - witten model , or to the 9-state potts model and numerically .",
    "@xcite the region @xmath54 is somewhat less interesting , since the model is ferromagnetic for @xmath55 . beyond that a new phase might appear , as predicted by chubukov , @xcite although so far its existence has not been confirmed by numerical calculations .",
    "@xcite this problem is , however , outside the scope of this paper .",
    "@xmath56 corresponds to the takhtajan - babujian @xcite integrable model with gapless excitation spectrum .",
    "this point is the critical point of a second - order ising - type phase transition with a gap opening linearly around the transition point . in a chain with periodic boundary condition ( pbc )",
    "the ground state is doubly degenerate for @xmath57 producing a dimerized phase , while for @xmath58 the haldane phase appears with a non - degenerate singlet ground state .",
    "this latter region includes the isotropic heisenberg point at @xmath59 and the exact nearest neighbor valence - bond state ( vbs ) @xcite at @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is another integrable point related to the lai - sutherland @xcite model , where the gap vanishes again . for @xmath62 a trimerized massless phase appears .",
    "@xcite in the composite - spin representation these points lie on the line @xmath63 , at @xmath64 for the takhtajan - babujian , at @xmath65 for the heisenberg , at @xmath66 for the vbs and at @xmath67 for the lai - sutherland points .",
    "furthermore , the composite - spin hamiltonian can be transformed into a nonlinear @xmath68 model and the results obtained in field theory can be related to our model . at @xmath69 , when the model reduces to two decoupled spin-1/2 chains , the field theory possesses a gapless excitation spectrum because the topological angle is an odd multiple of @xmath70 . according to the field - theoretical calculations @xcite the perturbations around this multicritical point",
    "are generically relevant and give rise to the opening of an energy gap , except for special points or lines .",
    "the takhtajan - babujian and lai - sutherland models belong to such exceptions .",
    "consequently , it is expected that by varying the @xmath21 parameters the gap vanishes only at the critical points and on the phase boundaries between the various phases .    in order to simplify the calculations ,",
    "first we study the effect of @xmath26 , @xmath25 and @xmath27 separately for fixed @xmath71 .",
    "then the calculation will be extended to a two - parameter plane , @xmath72 by choosing @xmath73 . in order to determine the phase diagram we examine the low - lying energy levels along different paths connecting those points in the parameter space , where the model is integrable .",
    "the ground - state configurations will also be investigated by calculating the local energy of a bond , the two - point correlation functions and a short - range order parameter .",
    "we have performed numerical calculations by applying the dmrg method @xcite on the model defined by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : plaquett])-([eq : comp1 ] ) .",
    "this is a real - space renormalization method where the lattice is built up gradually to the desired length , systematically truncating in the meantime the hilbert space by keeping only the most probable states .",
    "since the dmrg method works best for systems with free ends , we will consider our composite - spin model with open boundary condition ( obc ) . an unfavorable consequence of obc for the spin-1 model and consequently for the ladder models as well is that the degeneracies in the spectrum may be different from that obtained for a closed ring . in the nearest - neighbor valence - bond configuration , e.g. ,",
    "free @xmath74 spins remain at the ends of the chain , giving rise to a fourfold degenerate ground state . in the dimerized state ,",
    "on the other hand , the twofold degeneracy of the ground state is lifted if the number of sites is an even number .",
    "this makes the analysis of the spectrum more difficult .",
    "moreover , in the case of obc the total momentum is not a good quantum number .",
    "therefore , only the total spin @xmath75 and its projection to the quantization axis , @xmath76 can be used to classify the energy levels . since in the isotropic case",
    "the @xmath77 symmetry is satisfied , the spectrum was analysed by calculating a few low - lying levels of the different @xmath78 sectors .",
    "@xmath75 was determined from the degeneracy of the levels .    because our aim is to determine the overall behavior of the energy spectrum and to identify from it the possible phases , in most of the calculations we have used the less accurate version of dmrg , the so - called _ infinite - lattice method_. in this algorithm",
    "the lattice is built up by adding two lattice sites in each step .",
    "the results obtained for chains with @xmath79 sites were used in a finite - size scaling procedure to extrapolate to infinite lattice . on the other hand , close to the critical points and in those regions where the gap is small , the _ finite - lattice method _",
    "was applied with two or three iteration cycles to determine the energies more precisely .    in some cases , before doing the dmrg calculation on long chains ,",
    "the energy spectrum was determined by exact diagonalization on short chains with @xmath80 .",
    "this gave an idea of the sequence of the levels for different choices of the couplings and allowed to determine which states have to be targeted in the dmrg procedure .",
    "considering our limited computational resources , we had to restrict rather drastically the number of states , @xmath81 to be kept in the dmrg algorithm .",
    "a number , that can be used to characterize the numerical accuracy of the dmrg method is the discarded density - matrix weight ( truncation error ) .",
    "@xcite in the calculation of the ground - state energy for ladders with @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) sites it was largest close to the critical points with values of the order @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , while around the vbs point , where the gap is large , it was as small as @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) . for the excited states the truncation error was worse by one order of magnitude .    the real error in the dmrg procedure",
    "can , however , be much worse . @xcite it was estimated by comparing the energies obtained for the ladder model using the dmrg procedure to those of the spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic model or the spin-1/2 chain , where much better accuracy can be achieved . for chains with @xmath83 sites an agreement",
    "up to three or four decimal places has been achieved after the second iteration cycle of the finite - lattice method , if @xmath81 was chosen to be @xmath88 , while for chains with @xmath82 sites the same accuracy required to retain @xmath89 or @xmath90 states . at the vbs point",
    "the infinite - lattice algorithm without the iteration cycles provided almost the same accuracy .    in the extrapolation procedure",
    "the @xmath91 limit of the gap was determined by fitting a form @xmath92 or @xmath93 to the energy differences measured between the energy levels of the various @xmath75 sectors . in principle",
    "the first has to be used when the gap vanishes , @xmath94 , while the second gives the correct asymptotic behavior when the gap is finite .",
    "@xcite when the gap is finite but the chain length is not long enough to observe the correct parabolic behavior , the linear fit gives a lower - bound estimate .",
    "@xcite we have used the parabolic fit , whenever deviation from the linear dependence on @xmath95 was observed .",
    "in this section we present our numerical results for the low - lying levels of the model for various choices of the couplings . for a finite ladder",
    "the ground state is always a spin singlet . above this level",
    "there are two low - lying triplet excitations , which at @xmath96 have equal energy . at this point , they correspond to independent excitations on the two decoupled legs .",
    "these levels are followed by several @xmath97 excitations .",
    "the energy differences between all these levels scale as @xmath95 , indicating a gapless excitation spectrum .    for finite values of @xmath98 and @xmath30 the degeneracy of the two low - lying triplet levels is in general lifted .",
    "this is shown along the @xmath32 axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigv ] . in a finite chain with @xmath18 sites",
    "the energy difference between the lowest triplet and the ground - state singlet levels will be denoted by @xmath99 . when this quantity scales to a finite value , the ground state is a non - degenerate singlet with a finite gap .",
    "when , however , it scales to zero , we have to consider the next level .",
    "this is either the second triplet , or it may have been crossed by the lowest @xmath100 level .",
    "the energy difference between this quintuplet and the ground - state singlet levels will be denoted by @xmath101 , while @xmath102 denotes the energy difference between this quintuplet and the lowest triplet levels .",
    "let us consider first the effect of @xmath26 , since earlier calculations @xcite by exact diagonalization on relatively short chains could not determine satisfactorily the way the gap is opened . for @xmath103 the energy of the lowest triplet states and that of the singlet ground state come exponentially close to each other , and become degenerate in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath104 ) .",
    "this gives the well known fourfold degeneracy of the vbs - like state in a finite chain with opb .",
    "therefore the relevant energy gap can be obtained most easily by measuring the energy difference @xmath102 between the lowest - lying levels of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 sectors .",
    "this energy difference as a function of @xmath32 is shown in fig.[fig : l1 ] for @xmath107 .",
    "the lines connecting the values calculated at several distinct points are only guides to the eye .",
    "the inset in the figure shows in more detail the behavior of the gap close to the integrable point .    in the extrapolation to @xmath104 a @xmath95 fit",
    "was applied close to the critical point , because the chain lengths were not long enough to observe the parabolic behavior . as an indication of the accuracy of our calculation we mention , that at @xmath108 , where the haldane gap should be recovered , we obtained @xmath109 , in reasonable agreement to three decimal places with its best estimate .",
    "@xcite the ground - state energy divided by the chain length converges to @xmath110 , in agreement to six decimal places with earlier calculations .",
    "@xcite    as a further check we have also performed calculations for large values of @xmath32 and used the self - duality relationship in eq.([eq : self ] ) to obtain the gap for weak couplings .",
    "the results obtained in this way are shown in the inset . from this",
    "we could also conclude that our finite - size calculations are correct to at least 4 decimal places .",
    "even though the accuracy of our calculations is limited , we have found a linearly opening energy gap for @xmath111 .",
    "this is the first calculation where this could be demonstrated numerically .    for negative values of @xmath32",
    "the coupling between the chains is ferromagnetic , while the ` on - chain ' coupling remains antiferromagnetic .",
    "the low - lying part of the spectrum is essentially different from that of the @xmath112 regime .",
    "the degeneracy of the two @xmath106 triplet levels is again lifted , but even the lowest of them will remain separated from the singlet ground state .",
    "so the energy difference to be studied is @xmath99 .",
    "this quantity is shown on the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : l1 ] for @xmath113 .",
    "as it can be seen , the ground state is a non - degenerate singlet with a small , but finite gap to the lowest lying excitations .",
    "since the gap is small , the value of @xmath114 has been calculated using the finite - lattice method . this procedure with three iteration cycles and a @xmath95 fit gave at @xmath115 , e.g. , @xmath116 as a lower - bound estimate for the singlet - triplet gap .",
    "furthermore , the lowest quintuplet level has been found to become degenerate with the lowest triplet state in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus a gap separates the ground state from the continuum of excitations .    for small values of @xmath32",
    "the accuracy of the calculations has been checked using the relationship in eq .",
    "( [ eq : self1 ] ) .",
    "the gap is found to open linearly .",
    "thus @xmath26 is relevant for both signs of @xmath32 .",
    "on the other hand , for large negative values , in the region @xmath117 , we have found the vanishing of both @xmath114 and @xmath118 .",
    "this indicates that a new phase with gapless spectrum may appear there .",
    "however , due to the smallness of the gap around @xmath115 we were unable to locate the point where the transition occurs .",
    "the effect of the inter - leg coupling @xmath25 on the decoupled chains described by @xmath24 for @xmath119 has been considered by several authors .",
    "@xcite hida found that the gap is finite for @xmath120 , while dagotto _",
    "@xcite showed some evidence that the critical coupling is closer to zero , perhaps @xmath121 . on the other hand watanabe _",
    "et al_.@xcite and hsu and angls dauriac @xcite argued that the interchain coupling defined by @xmath25 is always relevant and @xmath122 .",
    "we repeated some of these calculations to confirm that this coupling is in fact relevant for both signs of the coupling @xmath29 .",
    "for @xmath123 the ground state is a non - degenerate singlet even in the thermodynamic limit with a rather large gap . at @xmath124 ,",
    "e.g. , a singlet - triplet gap with @xmath125 , and a singlet - quintuplet gap with @xmath126 has been found .",
    "for @xmath127 the spectrum is similar to that for @xmath128 , where the ground state becomes fourfold degenerate in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the gap , however , is rather small . at @xmath129 the calculation with the finite - lattice method and a @xmath95 fit gave @xmath130 , in agreement with previous results .",
    "@xcite    the plaquette coupling @xmath27 also turned out to be relevant for both signs of the coupling , but in some sense its effect is opposite to that of @xmath25 .",
    "a fourfold degenerate ground state is obtained with a finite quintuplet - singlet gap for @xmath131 . at @xmath132 ,",
    "e.g. , @xmath133 has been found .",
    "for @xmath134 the ground state remains singlet . at @xmath135",
    "the triplet - singlet gap is @xmath136 .    because of this opposing effect of these couplings , next we considered the competition of @xmath25 and @xmath27 by choosing @xmath137 . for negative values of @xmath29 the low - lying part of the energy spectrum",
    "resembles very much that found above for small negative @xmath32 .",
    "a finite gap develops between the singlet and triplet levels as shown in fig.[fig : l2 ] . at @xmath129 the finite - lattice algorithm and a @xmath95 fit gave @xmath138 .",
    "close to the critical point the extrapolated lower - bound values of the gap are even smaller , therefore the available chain lengths are still not long enough to determine the character of the opening of the gap .    on the other hand , for @xmath139 the analysis of the low - lying energy spectrum has shown that both @xmath114 and @xmath118 scale to zero , i.e.  the spectrum is gapless . since the system remains critical in an extended region for @xmath140 , a kosterlitz - thouless - like transition may occur at @xmath141 to the massive phase at @xmath142 .",
    "this could explain the slow opening of the gap in that region .",
    "these results are only partially consistent with the field theoretical predictions , which states that the spin-1/2 integrable point is unstable against all perturbations .",
    "our calculations indicate that although both @xmath25 and @xmath27 are relevant operators in the ladder model for both signs of the couplings @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the model remains critical at least along the @xmath143 half line .    to summarize our findings , three types of the spectrum",

    "both the singlet - triplet ( @xmath99 ) and the triplet - quintuplet ( @xmath102 ) energy differences vanish as @xmath95 .",

    "[ fig : l1_1a ] by the size of the symbol .    for @xmath156 a finite gap develops between the ground - state singlet and the lowes triplet levels , in the same way as for @xmath157 . a lower - bound estimate of the gap obtained by a @xmath95 fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : l1_1 ] .",

    "therefore , we have considered several higher lying levels to search for the other singlet level that would become degenerate with the ground state .",
    "we have not found any such level .",
    "this can be understood by recalling that in the case of opb the dimerized phase gives a truely twofold degenerate ground state only if the number of sites is odd , i.e. , the number of bonds is even .",
    "for chains with even number of sites the energy of the dimerized state depends on whether the bonds at the ends are strong or weak . inspection of the low - lying levels is therefore not sufficient to distinguish a real non - degenerate singlet ground state from a dimerized state .",
    "we will return to this problem later , when the dimer order parameter will be discussed .",

    "we will return to this problem later .",
    "extending the calculations to @xmath168 on the line @xmath108 the vbs - like state survives in a finite range , including the point @xmath169 , where the exact nearest - neighbor valence bond state is recovered . at this point",
    "the lowest singlet and triplet levels are degenerate for any finite chain lengths .",
    "the gap reaches its maximum value with @xmath170 , which after including the appropriate scaling factors due to our normalization to @xmath40 , agrees to 5 digits with the known result .",
    "@xcite    for larger values of @xmath29 along the @xmath171 line the lai - sutherland model and the trimerized phase of the bilinear - biquadratic model can not be reached by this ladder model .",
    "the extra levels introduced by the composite - spin representation will be low lying and will lead to a gapless new phase , as has already been found for @xmath148 .",
    "this massless phase has been found for large positive @xmath152 values also for @xmath45 .",
    "thus it is stable in an extended range of the couplings .      even though the structure of the low - lying part of the energy spectrum indicates the existence of various phases , its knowledge , as discussed above ,",
    "is not sufficient to clarify unambiguously the character of the ground state .",
    "we have , therefore , calculated several quantities in the ground state , like the local magnetization @xmath172 , the two - point correlation function @xmath173 and the local energy @xmath174 , where @xmath175 contains the couplings between spins on sites @xmath8 and @xmath176 .",
    "the correlation function falls off exponentially both in the haldane and the dimerized phases , turning to power - law like on the phase boundary , but the chains are still too short to distinguish clearly between these two possibilities .",
    "a better procedure could be to look at the local magnetization in the lowest triplet state .",
    "due to the free end spins of the exact nearest - neighbor valence - bond configuration the local magnetization is finite close to the chain ends in the vbs - like haldane phase . approaching the phase boundary , the extra spin becomes less and less localized and it spreads out homogeneously in the dimerized and gapless phases .",
    "the most useful procedure is , however , to consider the so - called short - range dimer order parameter .",
    "it can be defined by taking the difference of the local energy on neighboring bonds in the middle of the ladder , @xmath177 } \\,.\\ ] ] it is expected to have different behavior if the ground state is unique , fourfold degenerate , or twofold degenerate as in the dimerized state with spontaneously broken translational symmetry .",
    "a simpler quantity can be defined by taking the bilinear part of the coupling only @xmath178 } \\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : sdimo}\\ ] ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dim ] we present our results for the short - range dimer order parameter @xmath179 measured in the middle of the ladder as a function of the inverse of the chain length for a few points of the @xmath160 phase space .",
    "the parameter @xmath180 not shown in the figure gives the same kind of behavior .",
    "there is clearly an extended region in the parameter space , where the short - range order parameter scales to zero in the thermodynamic limit . at the vbs point",
    "itself @xmath179 was found to be zero for short finite chains already .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath179 happens not only in the haldane phase , but also along the negative @xmath32 axis and in a neighborhood of it , where the spectrum was undistinguishable from the spectrum of the supposedly dimerized state .    for large negative values of @xmath29 , however ,",
    "both for positive and negative values of @xmath32 , a transition was found to the state where @xmath180 and @xmath179 have non - zero value and the local magnetization at the ends of the chain vanishes .",
    "thus in the region where the ground state was found to be a non - degenerate singlet , the short - range dimer order allows to distinguish two regimes . in the region",
    "denoted as ` dimerized phase ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , both @xmath180 and @xmath179 scale to a finite value . in this phase",
    "the local magnetization at the ends of the chain is also absent . in the other region",
    "marked as ` massive ' , the dimer order disappears .",
    "the boundary between them is drawn schematically only in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] , its exact shape could not be determined , except that it has to go through the @xmath181 point .",
    "in the present paper we have considered a two - leg ladder model constructed from a composite - spin model . beside the usual heisenberg coupling between the spins on the legs inter - leg coupling between spins on the same and neighboring rungs",
    "have been introduced , as well as four - spin plaquette couplings .    for special values of these couplings",
    "this ladder model is equivalent to the spin-1/2 heisenberg model or the spin-1 bilinear - biquadratic model in the sense that the low - lying parts of the spectra are identical .",
    "thus massless , vbs - like and dimerized phases are expected to appear , but the phase diagram can be even richer .    the behavior of the energy differences between low - lying levels has been calculated using the dmrg method and the gap extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath91 ) was obtained with the method of finite - size scaling . we have also considered the short - range dimer order parameter .    it has been found that the spin-1/2 heisenberg ladder is unstable against most of the perturbations that couple the two legs , but there is a small range of the parameters where the combination of the perturbing operators is irrelevant .",
    "four different kinds of behavior was observed , as shown in fig .   [ fig : phase ] . in a region along and near to the line @xmath182 ,",
    "@xmath149 the spectrum remains gapless .",
    "everywhere else a gap is developed in the spectrum .",
    "three regions can , however , be distinguished depending on whether the ground state is non - degenerate , twofold or fourfold degenerate . the last case is easily detected by studying the asymptotic degeneracy of the spectrum .",
    "this phase is present around the @xmath63 , @xmath183 point , where the exact nearest - neighbor valence - bond state is recovered .",
    "the extra @xmath74 spins at the ends of the chains become more and more delocalized as we move away from the vbs point and disappear at the phase boundary , where the transition is either to the gapless phase or to a dimerized one .    the takhtajan - babujian point at @xmath108 , @xmath184 lies on the phase boundary between the vbs - like and the dimerized phases .",
    "the transition here could be detected not only in the change of the character of the spectrum , but also by the appearance of a finite short - range dimer order parameter .",
    "this quantity was used to distinguish the dimer phase also from the ` massive ' phase with non - degenerate singlet ground state , where the dimer order disappears again , in fact much faster than @xmath95 .",
