    "the elucidation of electroweak symmetry breaking is an important goal of particle physics . in the standard model , one neutral scalar higgs boson",
    "is assumed to exist , and it is associated with the generation of the masses of the electroweak gauge bosons and of the fermions . the neutral higgs boson has not yet been observed , and direct searches place a lower limit of about @xmath0 on its mass  @xcite .",
    "extensions of the standard model include the possibility of more higgs fields .",
    "the minimal supresymmetric standard model ( mssm ) requires two doublets to give mass to up - type and down - type fermions and to cancel anomalies .",
    "the doublets yield five physical higgs bosons : two neutral cp - even states , a cp - odd state , and a pair of charged scalars . at lowest order in perturbation theory , the masses and couplings of these states depend on two parameters which may be chosen as the pseudoscalar mass @xmath1 and the ratio of the two vacuum - expectation values @xmath2 .",
    "comprehensive analyses have been performed of the expected coverage of the @xmath3 parameter space at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "while the observation of at least one of the two cp even higgs bosons may not pose a problem for the lhc  @xcite , it will be challenging to distinguish it from its standard model counterpart over a large fraction of the parameter space . for small values of @xmath4",
    "the only viable channel in which to observe a heavy higgs boson could be the resonant production of the scalar @xmath5 with subsequent decay to @xmath6  @xcite , where @xmath7 is a bottom quark . for large values of @xmath4 , the identification of a charged higgs boson would provide evidence for a higgs sector beyond the standard model , meaning at least two higgs doublets , and possibly a supersymmetric higgs sector .",
    "if the charged higgs boson is lighter than the top quark @xmath8 , there is a good chance that it will be discovered via the decay channel @xmath9 in @xmath10 collisions at the tevatron collider at @xmath11 , or in @xmath12 collisions at the lhc at @xmath13 .",
    "searches in the run  i data samples by the cdf and d0 collaborations at the tevatron  @xcite place significant bounds on the mass @xmath14 and @xmath4 .",
    "if the charged higgs boson is heavier than the top quark , then its observation at hadron colliders becomes more problematic .",
    "in particular , there is no tree level coupling of a single charged higgs boson to gauge boson pairs , and the production of @xmath15 is inaccessible in weak boson fusion .",
    "the cross section for @xmath16 pair production is likely to be too small , and the heavy quark backgrounds may be too large for the observation of charged higgs boson pairs , unless additional supersymmetric particles enhance this loop - induced rate  @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar for the associated production of a charged higgs boson with a @xmath17 boson .",
    "the standard model leads to a fairly small rate , but supersymmetric particle loops might enhance the rate considerably  @xcite .",
    "the most promising search channel for a heavy @xmath15 is the associated production of a top quark and the charged higgs boson @xmath18 and @xmath19 via the intermediary of a bottom quark coupling  @xcite . throughout this paper we present results only for the @xmath20 channel , unless stated otherwise .",
    "if both the @xmath20 and @xmath21 channels are included the rates increase by a factor of two .",
    "advanced detector simulation studies have been done for the decay channels @xmath22  @xcite and @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this production mode is that the yukawa coupling to a top quark and a bottom quark is enhanced by a power of @xmath4 for large values of @xmath4 , as are the bottom quark yukawa couplings of the heavy neutral higgs bosons .",
    "we consider the leading order partonic subprocess to be @xmath24 with the initial state bottom quark taken as a constituent of an incident proton .",
    "the set of next - to - leading order subprocesses includes partonic reactions such as @xmath25 . the total rate for the process @xmath26 receives large corrections from collinear logarithms , originating from the radiation of a forward bottom quark jet  @xcite .",
    "these logarithmic terms can be resummed to all orders in the strong coupling strength @xmath27 , leading to the bottom parton picture  @xcite with an appropriate bottom quark factorization scale  @xcite .",
    "this resummation of large collinear logarithms is valid not only for charged higgs boson production , but it is generic as long as there is a large mass scale @xmath28 that provides @xmath29 behavior . in our case @xmath30 .",
    "the comparison of higher order predictions for total cross sections of neutral higgs boson production shows impressive agreement between gluon - initiated and bottom parton results  @xcite , but the absence of a heavy scale in neutral higgs boson production in association with bottom quarks may have an impact on some final state distributions .",
    "the @xmath31 production cross section can be evaluated with or without integration over the phase space of the final state bottom quark , corresponding to whether an accompanying final state bottom quark is observed or ignored .",
    "the term `` exclusive '' is generally used to refer to a situation in which the final state bottom quark is observed , and `` inclusive '' is used to refer to the case in which the final state bottom quark is ignored .",
    "calculations of the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) total cross section for @xmath18 are available in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite as well as in supersymmetric qcd  @xcite .",
    "if we use the same choice of parameters , most importantly the same renormalization and factorization scales , and the same scheme for renormalization for the yukawa couplings , our numerical results are in good agreement with those of ref .",

    "the inclusion of nlo contributions to the @xmath32 initial state process merges the `` inclusive - type '' process @xmath33 with the `` exclusive - type '' process @xmath25 , whose contribution appears as part of the set of nlo diagrams .",
    "the nlo contributions increase the reliability of the theoretical predictions by reducing the renormalization and factorization scale dependence of the total rate .    in this paper , we present fully differential nlo cross sections for the process @xmath33 .",
