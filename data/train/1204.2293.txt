    "transition - metal halides are one of the best playgrounds for studying diverse magnetism of low - dimensional spin systems . considering four stable halogen elements ( f , cl , br , and i ) , chlorine and bromine are most appealing because of the similar chemistry , yet different ionic radii that strongly influence superexchange pathways and relevant magnetic interactions .",
    "the change in the coupling regime between a chloride and an isostructural bromide is a fairly common scenario.@xcite the differences between chlorides and bromides can be generally understood in terms of interatomic distances and angles , depending on the size of the ligand . while these geometrical parameters determine individual exchange couplings , the influence on the spin lattice may be more involved , especially in mixed cl / br systems with a variable crystallographic symmetry and effects of bond randomness . in the following",
    ", we will present an even more striking example , where br atoms not only change the magnetic ground state but also trigger the incomplete structural order in the compound",
    ". we will consider ( cubr)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 , a long - range ordered antiferromagnet,@xcite which is remarkably different from its cl analog ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 showing a gapped singlet ground state with zero ordered magnetic moment on the cu sites.@xcite     ( color online ) left panel : low - temperature crystal structure of ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 featuring the [ cucl ] zigzag ribbons and tilted nbo@xmath6 octahedra.@xcite right panel : spin lattice in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "although the spatial arrangement of cu atoms resembles the square lattice , numerous inequivalent interactions are present.@xcite note the spin dimers formed on the fourth - neighbor cu atoms , as shown by a shaded oval . for notation of individual couplings , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] . ]    both ( cux)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 compounds ( x = cl , br ) feature flat [ cu@xmath7x ] magnetic layers separated by non - magnetic [ lanb@xmath8o@xmath1 ] slabs with two layers of corner - sharing nbo@xmath6 octahedra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : structure - cl ] ) .",
    "the original structural model described by kodenkandath is deceptively simple , with a regular square - lattice arrangement of cu and halogen atoms , and the ensuing tetragonal symmetry .",
    "recent studies@xcite questioned the completeness of this structural model , and identified an orthorhombic superstructure related to the doubling of both the @xmath10 and @xmath11 lattice parameters . in (",
    "cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 , main features of this superstructure are : i ) cooperative tilts of the nbo@xmath6 octahedra ; and ii ) displacements of cu and cl atoms in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "the jahn - teller distortion inherent to cu@xmath7 results in shorter and longer cu ",
    "cl bonds , so that cu and cl atoms form zigzag ribbons running along the @xmath11 direction ( fig .",

    "they also proposed a low - symmetry structure common for ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 and ( cubr)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1,@xcite but recent diffraction studies of the cl compound refuted this conjecture.@xcite ren and chen@xcite put forward an alternative orthorhombic structure later confirmed for ( cucl)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 and  as we will show below  roughly matching the experimental structure of ( cubr)lanb@xmath0o@xmath1 , which however features a disordered br position ( compare figs .

    "the powder sample was contained in a thin - walled borosilicate glass capillary that was spun during the experiment .",
    "the temperature of the sample was controlled by a he - flow cryostat ( temperature range @xmath22  k ) , a liquid - nitrogen cryostream ( @xmath23  k ) , and hot - air blower ( @xmath24  k ) .        neutron diffraction data were collected at the e9 high - resolution diffractometer ( @xmath25  a , @xmath26  a@xmath27 , @xmath28  k and 300  k ) installed at the hahn - meitner institute ( helmholtz center berlin for materials and energy , germany ) .",
