    "since cheng  @xcite showed that there is a factor - of - two discrepancy between the empirical data for the pion - nucleon sigma term ( @xmath6 ) and the naive estimates of the @xmath7-term from the mass spectrum , there have been a great deal of discussions and disputes about the @xmath6 and @xmath7 term ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "donoghue and nappi  @xcite suggested that the discrepancy is due to the presence of strange quarks in the nucleon , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath8 and showed that @xmath9 contributes almost @xmath10 to the quark condensate in the nucleon , making use of the skyrme model and bag model . at the first thought",
    ", it seems to be reasonable , since cheng used the zweig rule , _",
    "i.e. _ neglected @xmath9 . however , one serious question arises : a large fraction of the nucleon mass then stems from strange quarks if one follows ref .",
    "@xcite , which contradicts the quark model .",
    "another assumption was that the ratio @xmath11 is off by a factor of two , which means that the first order perturbation theory collapses .",
    "however , this kind of suggestion would lead to a breakdown of the gell - mann - okubo mass formula which predict the masses of hadrons in a few percent .",
    "motivated by these contradictions , gasser , leutwyler and sainio  @xcite recently reanalysed the @xmath7 term prudently , taking advantage of newly accumulated and better @xmath12 scattering data and considering the strong @xmath13-dependence of the scalar form factor @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite were @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 , a share of @xmath9 in the @xmath7 term , was about 0.2 , so that the corresponding contribution of the term @xmath9 to the nucleon mass was about @xmath19 .",
    "in the meanwhile , the efforts to understand the @xmath7 term puzzle theoretically have continued  @xcite .",
    "however , the bone of contention still lies in the role of strange quarks , more specifically the contribution of the @xmath9 to the @xmath7 term .",
    "recently , several works insist that there is no need to introduce a portion of strange quarks to explain the @xmath7 term discrepancy .",
    "bass  @xcite proposed that based on the gribov confinement the value of the @xmath7 term can be explained without need to invoke large strangeness content of the nucleon .",
    "ball , forte and tigg  @xcite also suggested that with the correct understanding of the baryon matrix element the @xmath7 term ( identified with latexmath:[$\\sigma_8 = \\bar{m } \\langle n| \\bar{u}u + \\bar{d}d -2\\bar{s}s    hence , following these arguments , strange quarks do not contribute to the nucleon mass . though it should be small , it is still important to consider the contribution of strange quarks to the @xmath7 term , in line with recent experiments indicating the fact that strange quarks might play an important role of explaining the properties of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "it is the object of the present work to study the strangeness contribution to the @xmath7 term in the framework of the semi - bosonized su(3 ) nambu - jona - lasinio soliton model ( often called as the chiral quark soliton model ) . in our model , the nucleon",
    "is understood explicitly as @xmath21 valence quarks coupled to the polarized dirac sea bound by a non - trivial chiral mean field configuration .",
    "the proper quantum numbers of the nucleon can be acquired by the semiclassical quantization  @xcite performed via integrating over the zero - mode fluctuations of the pion field around the saddle point .",
    "it allows the nucleon to carry proper quantum numbers such as spins and isospins .",
    "the su(3 ) njl soliton model has a merit in that it interpolates between the nonrelativistic naive quark model and the skyrme model .",
    "it enables us to study the interplay between these two different models  @xcite .",
    "the model is quite successful in describing the static properties of the baryons and their form factors @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in the next section , we sketch the basic formalism for the scalar form factor in su(3 ) njl soliton the model . in section 3 , we present the numerical results and discuss about them . in section 4 ,",
    "we summarize the present work and remark the conclusion .",
    "the scalar form factor @xmath22 is defined as a condensate of @xmath23 and @xmath24 quarks in the nucleon : @xmath25 with @xmath26 . the @xmath13 denotes the square of the momentum transfer .",
    "our model is characterized by a low  momenta qcd partition function in euclidean space given by the functional integral over pseudoscalar meson and quark fields : @xmath27 where @xmath28 @xmath29 are su(3 ) gell - mann matrices normalized as @xmath30 .",
    "the @xmath31 denotes the current quark mass matrix for which we take the form @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath1 are the corresponding current quark masses of the _ up _ , _ down _ and _ strange _ quark , respectively . here",

    "the @xmath35 stands for the momentum  dependent dynamical mass arising from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the momentum  dependence of the @xmath35 introduces the ultra  violet cut  off .",

    "the current strange quark mass @xmath1 is also settled in the same way .",
    "we treat the explicit symmetry breaking term @xmath54 perturbatively .",

    "the integral over the quark fields are trivial .",
    "the integral over the pseudo - goldstone boson fields can be performed by the saddle point method in the large @xmath21 limit . in order to find the quantum @xmath0 corrections , it is important to take into account the small oscillations of the pseudo - goldstone bosons around the saddle point and the zero modes .",
    "the zero modes are taken into account by the soliton expressed by @xmath67 with an su(3 ) unitary matrix @xmath68 .",

    "hence , we stick to the proper - time regularization for the @xmath7 term and make use of the same input parameters without adjusting . however , we shall not be here bothered by going through all the tedious technical details arising from the regularization ( see ref .",

    "the results we have obtained are in a good agreement with empirical data  @xcite .",
    "the reliable strangeness contents of the nucleon in the scalar channel is obtained by taking into account the @xmath1 corrections , since they suppress the excess of @xmath134 due to the leading order and rotational @xmath0 contributions .",
    "in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite suggesting no strangeness contribution , our model favors @xmath119 .",
