    "<S> we study scenarios where a finite set of non - demolition von - neumann measurements are available . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , in some situations , repeated application of such measurements allows estimating an infinite number of parameters of the initial quantum state , and illustrate the point with a physical example . </S>",
    "<S> we then move on to study how the system under observation is perturbed after several rounds of projective measurements . while in the finite dimensional case the effect of this perturbation always saturates , there are some instances of infinite dimensional systems where such a perturbation is accumulative , and the act of retrieving information about the system increases its energy indefinitely ( i.e. , we have ` heat vision ' ) . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze this effect and discuss a specific physical system with two dichotomic von - neumann measurements where heat vision is expected to show .    classically , the ability to extract information from a physical system is only constrained by our technological means : ideally , a maxwell demon could have a record of all the relevant variables of a given experiment , that could be actualized regularly without disturbing the dynamics of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in quantum mechanics , measurement is an active process that inevitably modifies the system under observation . </S>",
    "<S> it is precisely the change the system faces during such a process that prevents us from measuring two non - commuting observables simultaneously .    among the family of positive operator valued measures ( povms ) </S>",
    "<S> used to model the measurement process in quantum mechanics , projective or von neumann measurements stand out due to their special properties . </S>",
    "<S> von neumann measurements do not only retrieve information , they also establish a property on the system under observation : once a measurement is made and a result obtained , any subsequent measurement will always output the previous value . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , repeated measurements of the system will not modify its state any further . </S>",
    "<S> von neumann measurement are thus the closest analog of non - perturbative classical measurements , in the sense that they do not introduce external noise : any perturbation a system may experience is just a result of the state s non - definiteness of the property we want to estimate .    </S>",
    "<S> this last feature , the fact that consecutive repetitions of von neumann measurements do not alter the physical state of the system , is the basis for the zeno effect @xcite , where the evolution of a quantum system is literally frozen by a quasi - continuous measurement process . the quantum zeno effect has been shown recently to serve as a cooling mechanism in certain experimental situations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , from a tomographic point of view the zeno effect is not very interesting , since the outcomes of all measurements performed are due to be the same .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the compromise between the potential of von neumann measurements for tomography and the perturbation of the quantum system over which they are implemented . </S>",
    "<S> we have just seen that allowing only one type of measurement leads to a very poor dynamics and not - very - informative tomography . </S>",
    "<S> this motivates us to study physical scenarios where a limited ( finite ) number of projective measurements with a finite number of outcomes each are available .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first explore how the fact that we have several measurements to choose from can suppose a huge difference when we want to do tomography .    _ quantum tomography _    in a classical system , the ability to perform two different measurements of @xmath0 outcomes each can only retrieve , at most , @xmath1 bits of information . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , if we measure the height of an individual and then its weight , we shall not expect to gather more information by measuring its height one more time . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the quantum world , two measurements @xmath2 will not commute in general . given three instants of time @xmath3 , this can lead to ` paradoxical ' situations where the output of measurement @xmath4 at time @xmath5 may differ from the output at time @xmath6 if there has been an intermediate measurement of @xmath7 at time @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> sequential measurement schemes have already proven useful in the weak measurement scenario @xcite , and could play an important role in future experimental tests of quantum mechanics @xcite . however , the possible applications of consecutive ` strong ' non - commuting measurements for tomography seem to be absent from scientific literature . </S>",
    "<S> this is certainly peculiar if one takes into account that , giving two non - commuting projectors @xmath9 , the operator space spanned by the povm elements @xmath10 describing consecutive measurements may well be infinite dimensional , and so the corresponding estimated probabilities can give us access to an infinite number of parameters characterizing the state of our system . the current experimental credo , though </S>",
    "<S> , does not echo this simple observation : even when non - demolition interactions are available , systems are typically discarded after a single - shot measurement ( e.g. , in wigner function estimation @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> exploring many non - commuting properties of an unknown quantum state thus involves an unnecessarily large number of system initializations .    </S>",
    "<S> the previous ideas can be better illustrated by referring to a specific physical system .    </S>",

    "<S> this time will have to be very short ( and so the magnetic density @xmath41 will have to be very strong ) if we want to neglect the evolution of the system due to the main term ( [ energy ] ) during @xmath42 .    </S>",

    "<S> it follows that the spectrum of @xmath73 is in @xmath74 $ ] and so the limit @xmath75 exists and is equal to @xmath76 , the projector onto the space of eigenvectors of @xmath73 with eigenvalue 1 . </S>",
    "<S> note that such a limit does not depend on the initial probabilities @xmath63 , as long as all of them are strictly positive . </S>",
    "<S> this is so because @xmath77 is just the ( possibly null ) projector onto the intersection of the spaces @xmath78 .    </S>",
    "<S> since in finite dimensions @xmath79 and the set of trace - class operators coincide , we can conclude that repeated applications of the mapping @xmath67 will bring any quantum state @xmath68 to a limiting state @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , even though the system may experience some perturbations at the beginning of the measurement process , given some time it will stabilize into a steady state . </S>",
    "<S> the finite dimensional case is thus resemblant of the quantum zeno effect , i.e. , repeated applications of an independent random measurement strategy will ` freeze ' the state with respect to some types of environmental noise .    in infinite dimensional systems , </S>",
    "<S> though , the norms @xmath81 and @xmath82 are not equivalent , so the convergence of the sequence of vectors @xmath83 in @xmath70 does not necessarily imply the convergence of the sequence of states @xmath84 in @xmath85 . in particular , it could happen that @xmath86 .    as shown in appendix </S>",
    "<S> [ nonconvergence ] , if @xmath84 does not converge in @xmath85 , such a sequence of quantum states will not admit a finite dimensional approximation . </S>",

    "<S> in such a situation , the action of gathering information about the system will then increase its energy up to arbitrarily high values . </S>",
    "<S> we will hence call such an effect ` heat vision ' , in analogy with superman s famous ability to induce heat with the power of his stare @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we will next prove that , remarkably , our previous example exhibits heat vision for any initial state @xmath90 we place as an input .    </S>",
    "<S> first , since heat vision does not depend on the actual weights we assign to each measurement , we can assume w.l.o.g . that we perform any of the two measurements with probability 1/2 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurement channel @xmath67 is thus equal to    ( ) = \\{_j=+,-f^jf^j+(-f^j)(-f^j)}. [ type1 ]    as shown in appendix [ derivation ] , for any state @xmath68 ,    _ n\\{[^n()]^2}=0 . [ zero_conv ]    clearly , the values @xmath91 do not tend to 0 , and so the sequence of states @xmath84 does not converge in trace norm . </S>",
    "<S> also , equation ( [ zero_conv ] ) , together with the rnyi inequality @xmath92 , valid for any normalized quantum state , implies that the von neumann entropy of @xmath89 tends to infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> as we mentioned earlier , the fact that @xmath84 does not converge in @xmath85 implies that the energy of the system will diverge for any input state , as long as the hamiltonian describing the system has no energy bands in its spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> such is the case of the hamiltonian described by eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ energy ] ) , and , indeed , one can check that the kinetic energy of a quantum state after @xmath48 applications of the channel @xmath67 obeys the formula    e^(n)=e^(0)+n .    that is , on average , the temperature of the system will grow linearly with the number of measurements performed .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly recapitulate what is happening here : in order to perform measurement @xmath93 , first we have to apply a strong magnetic field @xmath31 for a time . </S>",
    "<S> it is not surprising then that the energy of the system increases when we perform such a change . </S>",
    "<S> however , after the spin measurement we will apply the opposite field , @xmath94 , thus inverting the previous unitary process . </S>",
    "<S> the only reason why the energy of the system ( or for the same sake , the state of the system ) changes is thus that we are measuring a single qubit in between ! </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the system is engineered in such a way that the entropy associated to such a spin measurement accumulates and accumulates in the canonical degree of freedom of our particle until the setup can not stand more energy . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is to be compared to the finite dimensional case , where it is always possible to find states of entropy 1 that are invariant under the action of any two dichotomic measurements . and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath95 can be simultaneously @xmath96-block - diagonalized , i.e. , there exists a basis where @xmath97 , with @xmath98 ( * jordan * , 1875 ) . </S>",
    "<S> any state of the form @xmath99 thus satisfies @xmath100 . ]    but heat vision can manifest in even more extreme ways : in appendix [ extreme ] we describe systems with 5 dichotomic observables where the purity of any initial state @xmath68 subject to @xmath48 sequential measurements is bounded by @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is independent of @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the extropy of such states will thus increase at least linearly in @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements involved , though , are quite abstract , and most likely impossible to implement in any present laboratory .    by showing that heat vision does emerge ( at least , theoretically ) in some physical systems , now we have a clear picture of how quantum systems evolve through sequential von neumann measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions are illustrated in figure [ dynamics ] , where the finite and infinite dimensional case are differentiated .        </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to think that heat vision arises in some infinite dimensional systems and not in finite dimensional ones just because in the former we can extract an infinite amount of information about the initial state of the system . </S>",
    "<S> however , in appendix [ non_heat ] we describe a system with two dichotomic von neumann measurements where the statistical analysis of sequential observations retrieves infinitely many parameters , but heat vision never shows up . </S>",
    "<S> heat vision is thus not equivalent to the possibility of accessing an infinite amount of information , but an independent property of the system under study .    finally , we would like to point out that both tomography with strong sequential measurements and heat vision can be experienced with current technology </S>",
    "<S> indeed , consider a regular ion trap setup with just one ion . </S>",
    "<S> then two internal states of such an ion could play the role of the spin in the system described above , while the displacement of the ion along the trap could account for the canonical degree of freedom . ` </S>",
    "<S> spin ' measurements in this scenario can be performed in the standard way , i.e. , exciting one of the internal levels with a laser and counting the number of emitted photons . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , an interaction of the form @xmath103 can be induced by a laser beam in standing wave configuration @xcite . in a usual ion trap setup </S>",
    "<S> , the former dispositions would effectively implement the measurements ( [ projectors ] ) over a particle subject to a harmonic potential ; in order to recreate the square potential , a trap of the form @xcite can be used . due to the brans - dicke approximation , though , the whole experiment must be conducted in the low temperature regime ( up to @xmath104k ) .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion _    in this paper we have studied the use and effect of repeated von neumann measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we have pointed out an extreme scenario where the statistical analysis of binary outcomes of sequential measurements allows estimating the full probability density of a trapped particle . </S>",
    "<S> we have also shown how sometimes the action of alternating measurements can lead to a non - convergent dynamics in infinite quantum dimensional systems . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon always comes together with an unbounded energy increase ( hence its name ` heat vision ' ) , and can be observed experimentally in current ion trap setups . </S>",
    "<S> is this the end of the story ? </S>",
    "<S> dreaming on , one could conceive a new architecure for quantum computing based on sequential strong measurements . in this model </S>",
    "<S> , the user could perform a ( small ) number of non - commuting dichotomic measurements over a continuous variable system , and computations would be carried out by deciding which measurement to perform at every step . </S>",
    "<S> although still vague , we hope to explore this idea in future communications .    </S>",
