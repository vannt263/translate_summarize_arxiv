    "importance of finding a @xmath5 twin hf qpos in an ultraluminous x - ray source in order to resolve the issue of an intermediate mass black hole has been pointed out by @xcite . quite recently , such stable twin - peak x - ray quasi - periodic oscillations with 3:2 frequency ratio have been reported for the ultraluminoues m82  x-1 source ; the observed frequencies are large enough to be interpreted as twin hf qpos if the assumed central black hole in the source has an intermediate ( @xmath6 ) mass @xcite .",
    "estimates of the m82  x-1 mass were made by @xcite being based on the simple mass scaling method or on a monte carlo approach related to the relativistic precession model @xcite that has been applied for fitting the timing measurements data obtained in the microquasar gro  1655 - 40 @xcite where also related low frequency qpos have been taken into account being modelled by the nodal precession @xcite . while in the gro  1655 - 40 microquasar one of the low frequency qpos is clearly related to the simultaneously observed twin hf qpo , in the case of m82  x-1 ultraluminous source , we can not uniquely identify one of the observed low frequency qpos that could be directly related to the twin hf qpos . for this reason , the estimates of the m82  x-1 black hole mass can not be precise if based only on the timing measurements , as we can only assume a common radius of the measured twin hf qpos and a low frequency qpo being related to the whole set of the observed low frequency qpos .",
    "we consider useful and necessary to realize a more extended and robust analysis of the limits on the m82  x-1 intermediate black hole mass using a variety of hf qpo models based on the frequencies of the geodesic ( quasi)circular motion , i.e. , the keplerian frequency , or the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies of the test particle motion in the kerr geometry .",
    "we select the geodesic models that are able to explain the twin hf qpos observed with the @xmath5 frequency ratio in the microquasars ( binary systems containing a black hole ) grs 1915 + 105 , gro 1655 - 40 , xte 1550 - 564 , assuming that these models could be relevant also for the scaled up intermediate mass black hole .",
    "twin hf qpos in all of the three microquasars @xcite . ] along with the successful geodesic models we apply also some of their variants that are not able to explain the @xmath5 twin hf qpos in the three microquasars , but could be interesting for the ultraluminous source m82 x-1 .    to obtain the limits on the black hole mass , we use the resonance relations technique introduced in @xcite . for each of the geodesic oscillation models this technique introduces a specific dependence of the dimensionless radius @xmath7 where the @xmath5 twin hf qpos occur on the dimensionless black hole spin @xmath8 .",
    "this @xmath9 dependence is governed by the frequency ratio , being independent of the black hole mass @xmath10 that is controlled by magnitude of the observed frequencies as shown in @xcite .",
    "we also assume that some of the observed low frequency qpos can be related to the same radius as the twin hf qpos , applying thus the resonance relations technique to the nodal ( lense - thirring ) frequency model along with the considered variant of the geodesic model of twin hf qpos .",
    "the low frequency qpos can be then used to put additional restrictions on the black hole mass and the black hole spin , if combined with the restrictions implied by the geodesic twin hf qpo models .",
    "we compare the m82 x-1 mass limits obtained in the framework of the hf qpo models based on the frequencies of the geodesic , test particle motion that are determined purely by the gravitational field of the black hole to the mass limits obtained in the framework of a non - geodesic model , namely the string loop oscillation model @xcite .",
    "the axisymmetric current - carrying string loops could represent plasma exhibiting a string - like behaviour due to dynamics of the magnetic field lines @xcite , or due to the thin flux tubes of magnetized plasma simply described as 1d strings @xcite .",
    "their oscillations are thus governed not only by the black hole gravitational field , but also the string loop parameters determining the interplay of the string loop angular momentum and ( magnetic ) tension are relevant @xcite .",
    "contrary to the geodesic models , the string loop oscillation model can explain the @xmath5 twin hf qpos in all the three microquasars @xcite , moreover , it can be applied also to neutron star systems @xcite .",
    "it is thus interesting to test its predictions for the intermediate black hole system .",
    "m82 x-1 is the brightest x - ray source in m82 galaxy , giving extremely high luminosity indicating a central black hole with intermediate mass in the interval @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the mass estimates inferred from the luminosity measurements were later confirmed by estimates based on modelling the continuum x - ray spectrum of the source that put the mass limits in the interval @xmath12 @xcite ; however , there is a model predicting a substantially lower mass @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "another information on the mass of the m82 x-1 black hole is contained in the important observations of low - frequency quasiperiodic oscillations @xcite . for sources containing a black hole ,",
    "the low - frequency qpos are usually related to the nodal ( lense - thirring ) frequency of the test particle motion @xcite",
    ". however , the mass estimates based on scaling relations using low - frequency characteristic time scales , are strongly uncertain @xcite .",
    "therefore , the observational results related to the stable twin hf qpos reported quite recently in @xcite are extremely important as they bring a possibility of obtaining more stringent restrictions on the mass of the central black hole as predicted by @xcite , giving potentially a clear information on existence of an intermediate mass black hole . really , magnitude of the observed frequencies and character of the oscillations indicate strongly that they should be twin hf qpos occurring in close vicinity of the black hole horizon , being related to the orbital motion .",
    "the twin hf qpos observed in the m82 x-1 source are similar to those observed in the microquasars grs 1915 + 105 , gro 1655 - 40 , xte 1550 - 564 .",
    "there is the same stable @xmath5 frequency ratio of the observed frequencies , and magnitude of the frequencies is comparable to the magnitude of the orbital ( keplerian ) frequency of a test particle orbiting at the innermost stable circular geodesic , if we assume an intermediate black hole at the m82 x-1 source .",
    "moreover , the twin hf qpos could be related also to the low - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations observed in the m82 x-1 source @xcite .",
    "the lower and the upper frequency of the twin quasiperiodic oscillations observed at the source m82 x-1 as presented in @xcite reads f_l = 3.320.06  , f_u = 5.070.06  .",
    "[ ffl ] [ ffu ] because of the mass - scaling of the quasiperiodic oscillations observed in the microquasars , these frequencies should correspond to the hf qpos in the field of intermediate mass black holes @xcite .",
    "the other details of the detected twin hf qpos , namely the fractional rms amplitudes and the quality factors , are presented in @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss them here , since we concentrate our attention on the observed frequencies only .",
    "the low frequency oscillations observed in the source m82 x-1 are also fully taken into account in @xcite . the frequency range and mean value of this range 37   < f_low < 210  , f_low - mean ~120  , [ fflow ] [ fflowm ] has been also considered in the estimates of the intermediate black hole mass presented in @xcite where a monte carlo technique has been used that was developed for application of the relativistic precession model to explain the twin hf qpos and simultaneously observed low frequency qpo in the microquasar gro  j1655 - 40 @xcite .",
    "the m82  x-1 black hole mass estimated in this way reads m_m82x-1 ~41563  m_. however , contrary to the case of the gro  j1655 - 40 microquasar @xcite , for the low frequency qpos considered in @xcite we are not able to fix the frequency of the low - frequency qpos simultaneously observed with the twin hf qpos .",
    "therefore , the error in establishing the m82 x-1 black hole mass is large as all the observed low frequency qpos are considered as a possible partner of the twin hf qpos .",
    "we shall first give a short overview of the models of twin hf qpos in low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems .",
    "the twin hf qpos are observed in both neutron star and black hole lmxbs , but we concentrate on the black hole cases ( microquasars ) that could be extended to the systems with an intermediate or a supermassive black hole . in such systems we can always assume a crucial role of the strong gravity in vicinity of the black hole horizon as the observed frequencies are close to the orbital and epicyclic frequencies of the quasicircular motion of test particles in the field of black hole with mass determined by methods independent of the timing measurements .",
    "the models of twin hf qpo in the black hole systems can be separated into three categories .",
    "the kinematics of the epicyclic orbital motion allows for variability related to the motion of `` hot spots '' , i.e. radiating blobs of matter in the innermost parts of the accretion disc .",
    "the standard relativistic precession ( rp ) model @xcite demonstrates the two modes of the relativistic epicyclic motion of hot spots as the twin hf qpos .",
    "the two modes are related to the orbital motion and periastron ( radial ) precession of the relativistic orbits in strong gravity near the black hole horizon .",
    "moreover , due to the lense - thirring relativistic precession , the rp model can be related also to the low - frequency qpo modes observed on time scales about one order of magnitude slower than the twin hf qpos @xcite .",
    "considering the epicyclic motion in both radial and vertical direction , modifications of the rp model can be defined , e.g. , the so called total precession model @xcite .",
    "an alternative to the rp model is the tidal disruption ( td ) model @xcite according to which the twin hf qpos are generated by large accreting inhomogeneities deformed to an orbiting `` ring - section '' by tidal forces of the black hole .",
    "note that in the rp and td models no explanation of the observed @xmath5 frequency ratio exists at the present state of knowledge , however , one can not exclude existence of some resonant phenomena between the two modes of oscillations .",
    "we can only state that in the rp model the @xmath5 frequency ratio is obtained at radii very close to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) where the edge of the keplerian disc is assumed , while for the td model this radius is shifted slightly above the isco but it is still the innermost region of the accretion disc @xcite",
    ".      the resonant models of the twin hf qpos assume a particular parametric or non - linear forced resonance of the oscillatory modes of the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "the frequency commensurability is thus crucial ingredient of the resonant models , and a particular case of this commensurability occurs for the parametric ( internal ) resonant phenomena that become strongest in the case of the @xmath5 frequency ratio @xcite .",
    "the simplest variant of the resonant model is the resonant epicyclic model where the two modes in resonance are identified to correspond to the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillations @xcite . of course , in the case of the non - linear forced resonances , the combinational ( beat ) frequencies can be relevant @xcite .",
    "the commensurability of the frequencies is crucial also for the model of warped disc ( wd ) oscillations where resonances are relevant for oscillations of deformed keplerian discs and the frequencies of the oscillatory modes are governed by combinations of the keplerian and epicyclic frequencies @xcite .",
    "similarly , oscillations of slender tori can be also determined by the frequencies of the geodesic motion @xcite .",
    "however , for non - slender tori , the non - geodesic influence have to be introduced , modifying thus the simple geodesic formulae for the oscillatory frequencies @xcite .",
    "in the kinetic hot spot models and the resonant models it is assumed that both the observed oscillations are produced by the same mechanism at the same radius of the accretion disc and correspond to interacting modes . on the other hand , in the discoseismic models considering the non - geodesic pressure influence ,",
    "the oscillatory modes are assumed to be inertial - gravity , corrugation , or pressure , and they are excited by different mechanism at different radii of the disc , being thus non - interacting modes that evolve independently @xcite .    in the case of the models with non - interacting oscillatory modes",
    "the @xmath5 frequency ratio condition can be satisfied only for a specific value of the dimensionless black hole spin @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we shall not consider in the following such models , similarly to the hf qpo models based on the specific character of the near - extreme kerr spacetimes that can be relevant only for near - extreme values of the black hole spin @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "disc oscillations modelled by hydrodynamic simulations of accretion @xcite are shown to be damped by magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "moreover , the complex magnetohydrodynamics simulations of accretion processes do not reproduce any phenomena that could be related to the @xmath5 frequency ratio hf qpos observed in the lmxbs .",
    "it is not clear at the present state of knowledge if the magnetohydrodynamics simulations include all the relevant ingredients  low frequency qpos were observed in the magnetohydrodynamics simulations including radiative cooling @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the twin hf qpos quite naturally occur in the framework of the string loop oscillation model where the string tension could represent in an approximative way the influence of internal magnetic field of accreting structures @xcite .",
    "we can conclude that there is a large variety of the twin hf qpo models , however , no commonly accepted theory of qpo exist at the present state of knowledge @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , most of the models assume the crucial role of gravity and the frequencies of the oscillatory modes are then directly related to the frequencies of the geodesic epicyclic motion or to their combinations .",
    "we shall focus attention to these geodesic oscillation models of twin hf qpos assuming that the black hole spacetime is determined by the standard kerr geometry .",
    "we present now the geodesic oscillation models selected here to put limits on the intermediate mass black hole at the m82 x-1 source .",
    "more details on the geodesic oscillation models can be found in @xcite .",
    "for each of the selected models we state , if the model can explain the twin hf qpos in the three microquasars . the mass and spin of the black hole implied by the twin hf qpos have to be confronted to the mass limits implied by optical measurements independent of the x - ray timing measurements , and the dimensionless spin measurements based on the x - ray observations of spectral continuum or profiled spectral lines  for details see @xcite .",
    "the hot spot models assume radiating hot spots moving along nearly circular geodesic trajectories . in the case of the standard rp model @xcite , the upper of the twin frequencies is attributed to the orbital keplerian frequency , @xmath15 , while the lower one is attributed to the periastron precession frequency , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the frequency of the radial epicyclic motion .",
    "the low frequency qpos are then related to the nodal ( lense - thirring ) precession with frequency @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the frequency of the vertical epicyclic motion .",
    "the rp model can well explain the @xmath5 twin hf qpos and the related low - frequency qpo at the microquasar gro 1655 - 40 @xcite .",
    "variants of the relativistic precession ( hot spot ) model are discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we select the rp1 model introduced by @xcite where the identification of the upper and lower frequencies is given by @xmath20 and @xmath16 , and the rp2 model , called total precession model @xcite , where @xmath15 and @xmath21 .",
    "the rp1 model can explain well the twin hf qpos at the microquasar xte 1550 - 564 @xcite , while the rp2 model can explain the twin hf qpos at the microquasar gro 1655 - 40 , giving results similar to those of the standard rp model @xcite    we extend our selection of the hot spot models of hf qpos for the td model based on the idea of an orbiting hot spot distorted by the tidal forces of the black hole @xcite where the upper and lower frequencies are identified by the relations @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the td model can not explain the twin @xmath5 twin hf qpos in any of the three microquasars .",
    "however , it could be interesting to use this model for the case of the intermediate mass black hole testing thus the hole tidal effects on large inhomogeneities in the accretion disc .",
    "the resonance epicyclic ( re ) models @xcite assume resonance of oscillation modes of accretion discs orbiting black holes giving the simple identification of the upper and lower frequencies @xmath20 and @xmath24 .",
    "this model explain well the twin @xmath5 hf qpos in the microquasar grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "the radial profiles of the upper and lower frequencies defined in the framework of the re and rp models are compared in figure 1 , demonstrating that the @xmath5 frequency ratio occurs closer to the isco ( where the radial epicyclic frequency vanishes ) in the rp model .",
    "the accretion discs can be geometrically thin with keplerian ( geodetical ) profile of angular velocity @xcite , or toroidal , geometrically thick with angular velocity profile governed by gravity and pressure gradients @xcite .",
    "frequency of the disc oscillations is related to the keplerian ( orbital ) and epicyclic frequencies of the circular geodesic motion for both keplerian discs @xcite and the slender toroidal discs @xcite .",
    "the resonance can be of two kinds .",
    "the internal , parametric resonance occurs directly between the radial and vertical epicyclic oscillatory modes , giving the basic resonance epicyclic model .",
    "the parametric resonance is governed by the mathieu equation implying strongest resonant phenomena for the frequency ratio @xmath5 @xcite that naturally explain the observed frequency ratio in the twin hf qpos . on the other hand ,",
    "the forced non - linear resonance admits presence of combinational ( beat ) frequencies in the resonant solutions @xcite  then the beat frequency @xmath25 implies the observed frequency ratio @xmath26 at the radius where the frequency ratio @xmath27 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , we test also the re1 model where the frequency identification is defined by @xmath20 and @xmath28 and the re2 model with @xmath29 and @xmath24 . defining the beat frequency @xmath30",
    ", we select the model re3 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the model re4 having @xmath31 and @xmath28 , and the model re5 defined by @xmath33 and @xmath28 .",
    "although none of the beat frequency resonance models re1 - 5 can explain the twin hf qpos in any of the three microquasars , it is useful to apply them for the intermediate black hole in the m82 x-1 source in order to test the role of the forced resonant phenomena .    for completeness we add also the wd oscillation model related to the inertial - acoustic modes and the so called g - modes of warped thin disc oscillations @xcite , with the identification of the frequencies given by the relations @xmath34 and @xmath35  this model is not able to explain the twin hf qpo in any of the three microquasars @xcite .",
    "the combinations of the keplerian and epicyclic frequencies giving the upper and lower frequencies of the twin hf qpos are presented for all the selected models in table 1 .",
    "the frequency resonance conditions of the parametric and direct forced resonances are the same , but the physical conditions as the resonant frequency width , resonance strength , and time evolution differ  for details see @xcite . here",
    "we concentrate attention to the resonance frequency conditions only , as the present state of the hf qpo measurements is not precise sufficiently to test the sophisticated details of the predictions of parametric or forced resonances , e.g. , the resonance frequency width .",
    "we expect that the future generation of the x - ray satellite detectors , as planned in the loft observatory @xcite , could make precision of the frequency measurement ( in both the central frequency and the qpo peak width ) high enough to follow details of the assumed resonance phenomena .",
    "it should be stressed that details of the resonant phenomena could cause a slight shift from the requirement of strictly rational frequency ratios at resonance .",
    "for example , the parametric resonance allows for a scatter of the resonant frequencies , i.e. , this kind of resonance can occur while the oscillating modes in resonance have frequency ratio slightly different from the exact rational ratio ",
    "the width of the resonance scatter strongly decreases with increasing order of the resonance @xcite . in the case of forced resonances ,",
    "scatter of the frequency ratio is governed by the non - linear effects @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the case of the m82 x-1 source it is necessary to consider equally all the frequency ratios of the observed twin hf qpos with @xmath36 .          in the kerr spacetimes characterized by the mass @xmath10 and dimensionless spin @xmath8 , the circular geodesic motion is restricted to the equatorial plane @xcite . for near - circular epicyclic motion ,",

    "the dimensionless radius @xmath39 , expressed in terms of the gravitational radius @xmath40 of the black hole , is introduced .    for microquasars , i.e. , the black hole low mass x - ray binaries with the observed 3:2 frequency ratio of the observed frequencies of twin hf qpos , usually the resonance epicyclic model of hf qpos with the vertical and radial epicyclic oscillations",
    "is treated @xcite . for a particular resonance n : m of the vertical and radial oscillations , the equation [ ratios ] _",
    "r = _ determines the dimensionless resonance radius @xmath41 as a function of the dimensionless spin @xmath8 for the direct resonance of the radial and vertical oscillations .",
    "this can be easily extended to the resonances with frequencies that combine the keplerian and epicyclic frequencies  for details see @xcite .",
    "we determine radial positions where a given frequency ratio @xmath42 occurs for all considered versions of the geodesic models of hf qpos with the corresponding combinations of the radial and vertical epicyclic or the  keplerian oscillation frequencies . in the kerr black hole spacetimes , the frequencies satisfy the inequality @xmath43 for whole the interval @xmath44 .",
    "we use the technique developed in the framework of the resonance models @xcite , taking into account only the  direct or simple combinational resonances . for all possible resonances",
    ", the  resonance condition is given in terms of the  rational frequency ratio parameter @xmath45 all the  resonant conditions determining implicitly the  resonant radius @xmath46 have to be related to the  radius of the  innermost stable circular geodesic @xmath47 giving the  inner edge of keplerian discs .",
    "therefore , we always require @xmath48 , where @xmath47 is implicitly given by the relation @xcite @xmath49    it is important to stress that if we assume any two oscillations with given frequencies , having an arbitrary ratio , and occurring at a common radius , the radius can be determined in the same way as if the assumption of the resonant phenomena with exact rational frequency ratio is used . here",
    "we use the generalized condition allowing for the resonance scatter @xcite , assuming a general , non - rational , ratio of the observed lower and upper frequencies of the twin hf qpos that is in the vicinity of the @xmath5 ratio as given by the frequency measurement errors presented in @xcite .",
    "then the  frequency ratio parameter @xmath50 determines modified resonance relations for frequency ratios close to the exactly rational ratios .    in the case of the two basic models , namely the re and rp models ,",
    "we give the implicit resonance relations @xmath51 for determination of the radius @xmath46 where the twin oscillations given by the frequency ratio @xmath52 occur in dependence on the dimensionless spin @xmath8 ; the other resonance relations can be found in @xcite . for the re model the resonance relation reads a = a^(x , p ) , while for the rp model the relation reads @xmath53 where @xmath54    in the geodesic models selected for our tests , the upper and lower frequencies of the twin hf  qpos are related to the combinations of the keplerian and radial or vertical epicyclic frequencies as presented in the table i. the nodal frequency is in all the cases determined in the same way as in the standard rp model , i.e. , by the relation for the so called lense - thirring precession @xcite _ nod = _ k - _ .

    "the mean values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are not in exact @xmath5 ratio , but the errors of the frequency measurements do not exclude this ratio and for this reason we are not able to estimate possible shift of the frequency ratio from the exact rational resonant frequency condition corresponding to the resonant frequency width related to the effects of the parametric resonance or the non - linear forced resonant phenomena @xcite .",
    "therefore , we use in determining the limits on the m82 x-1 black hole mass the simple method of treating the whole observed range of the frequency ratio in the twin hf qpo data for both families of the applied geodesic models of twin hf qpo ( hot spot , and resonance ) .",
    "the resonance is not explicitly assumed in both the rp and re models .",
    "only the frequency ratio is relevant , being taken from whole the interval allowed by the observational data with given errors .",
    "the resonance frequency relations are thus applied in the modified form with non - rational frequency ratios implied by the observational errors of the frequency measurements of the twin hf qpos .",
    "of course , we still assume that both the oscillatory modes are related to a common radius in the kerr black hole spacetime .",
    "the method of determining the black hole mass limit implied by the twin hf qpos is for all the considered geodesic models based on the resonance relations technique developed in @xcite that is applied for arbitrary , non - rational frequency ratio .",
    "we assume that any frequency from the interval of allowed values of the upper frequency can be combined with any frequency from the allowed interval of the lower frequency .",
    "the low frequency qpos are then used to put additional restriction on the black hole parameters .",
    "for all the geodesic models of the twin hf qpos the observed low frequency qpos are related to the nodal precession with the lense - thirring frequency .",
    "the resonance relation method thus consists from the following succeeding steps .",
    "\\(i ) we determine the range of frequency ratios related to the measured upper and lower frequencies of the twin hf qpos .",
    "this range is applied to the ratios of the upper and lower frequencies treated in the framework of a given model . in order to find the limits on the black hole mass , it is enough to consider only the frequency ratios at the edges of the allowed frequency ratio interval because of the character of the radial profiles of the keplerian and epicyclic frequencies in the kerr black hole spacetimes @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) we use the frequency resonance relation for the considered geodesic model , @xmath58 , and for the maximal and minimal values of the frequency ratio @xmath59 of the interval given by the observational data we give the related dependence on the radius where the twin oscillations occur .",
    "allows for significant simplification as the mass dependence is cancelled because of the same mass scaling in the keplerian and epicyclic frequencies @xcite . ] the twin hf qpo radius , @xmath60 , can be determined for a given dimensionless spin @xmath8 of the black hole @xmath61 due to the equation @xmath62 ; the radius has to satisfy the condition @xmath63 .",
    "such a solution for radius is unique for the kerr black holes @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) the mass parameter is adjusted by fitting the theoretical , geodesic model upper ( or lower ) frequency to the corresponding observed frequency . for the chosen upper frequency and the radius @xmath46 related to the spin @xmath8 by the preceding procedures , we determine the corresponding black hole mass parameter @xmath55 in dependence on the black hole spin @xmath8 .",
    "( the same dependence follows from fitting to the lower observed frequency . )",
    "this procedure gives the limit on the black hole mass for the whole interval of the allowed black hole spin , @xmath0 .",
    "\\(iv ) the restrictions from the nodal frequency model related to the low frequency qpos are given in the same way as those related to the twin hf qpos .",
    "at each radius predicted by the hf qpos model under consideration , we assume occurrence of all observed low frequency qpos equal to the nodal frequency , giving thus the additional limits on the black hole mass . taking a given value of the spin from the interval @xmath0 , and the related radius given by the resonance condition of the considered geodesic model , the mass parameter can be determined for the given spin @xmath8 for each of the nodal frequencies from the observed interval . as in the case of the twin hf qpos ,",
    "the lower and upper values of the observed frequencies of the low frequency qpos are sufficient to give the restrictions introduced by the nodal frequency model .",
    "\\(v ) combining restrictions implied by the twin hf qpos and the low frequency qpos under assumption of their occurrence at a common radius , we obtain restrictions on the black hole mass and spin for each of the considered geodesic hf qpo models combined with the nodal precession model .",
    "the limits on the radius where the simultaneous hf qpos and low frequency qpos occur can be obtained using the resonance frequency relation technique .",
    "the presented technique could be named _ simultaneous frequency relation technique _",
    ", as the precise resonance conditions represent a simple form of this technique , related to the rational frequency ratios .",
    "on the other hand , the resonances themselves allow for non - rational ratios , if non - linear phenomena and resonance frequency width enter the play .",
    "results of the numerical calculations are presented in figure [ figrp ] for the rp model and its variants rp1 and rp2 , in figure [ figre ] for the re model and its variants re1 and re2 , and in figure [ figtdtw ] for the special cases of the td model and the wd model .",
    "the frequency relations governing the upper and lower hf qpos in the selected geodesic models are presented in table [ tab1 ] , where the range of the allowed values of the black hole mass , @xmath64@xmath65 , determined by the selected geodesic models of twin hf qpos for the range of the black hole spin , @xmath0 , is presented . finally , the intervals of the black hole mass and spin , allowed by the combined restrictions of the twin hf qpos geodesic models and the nodal frequency model of the low frequency qpos are given in table 1 .",

    "due to the degeneracy of the radial profiles of the string loop oscillation frequencies in the schwarzschild spacetimes ( @xmath100 ) , i.e. , their independence of the stringy parameter @xmath94 , the fitting predicts only one value of the mass parameter @xmath10 for the spin @xmath100 at each observational event .",
