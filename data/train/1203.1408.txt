    "there are few three - dimensional problems in quantum mechanics which allow a complete analytical solution for any value of the orbital angular momentum ( the @xmath0-wave channel is very similar to a simpler one - dimensional equation ) @xcite .",
    "so , numerous methods have been developed to solve numerically with a high accuracy the eigenvalue equations associated with various systems . among these techniques ,",
    "the lagrange - mesh method ( lmm ) , which is especially easy to implement , can produce very accurate results .",
    "first created to compute eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a two - body schrdinger equation @xcite , it has been extended to treat semirelativistic hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the trial eigenstates are developed in a basis of particular functions , the lagrange functions , which vanish at all mesh points , except one .",
    "once the potential is known in the configuration space , its matrix elements are simply the potential values at the mesh points , if they are computed with an associated gauss quadrature . at first sight , this method could look like a discrete variational method , but this is absolutely not the case since the eigenfunctions can be computed at any position . because of the use of the gauss quadrature scheme , the method is not variational but the results are too a large extent independent of the sole nonlinear parameter of the method fixing the physical scale of the system .",
    "generally , a great accuracy can be reached with a small mesh @xcite .    at the beginning",
    ", the lmm was developed in the configuration space .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the fourier transform of the eigenfunctions computed in the configuration space can easily be obtained with a good accuracy in the physical domain of the momentum space @xcite .",
    "moreover , observables in this space can easily be computed with a good accuracy using only matrix elements and eigenfunctions in the configuration space .",
    "but , for some particular problems , it can be preferable to work in the momentum space .",
    "this is the case when the potential presents discontinuities in the configuration space @xcite or when the potential is given in the momentum space . in this last case ,",
    "if it is possible to use the lmm by computing first the fourier transform of the potential , we will show here that the lmm can be adapted to solve the eigenequations directly in momentum space .",
    "observables in both configuration and momentum spaces can also be computed with a good accuracy using only eigenfunctions computed in momentum space .",
    "moreover , we will show that the new lmm can provide these types of data very efficiently and very easily , using again the fundamental properties of the lagrange functions .",
    "let us note that the method presented here relies on a mesh of points built with the zeros of a laguerre polynomial , but a general procedure for deriving other lagrange meshes related to orthogonal or non - orthogonal bases has also been developed @xcite .",
    "several methods exist to solve eigenequations in momentum space .",
    "for instance , iterative procedures have been developed @xcite .",
    "they are quite accurate but resort finally to numerical integrations on a mesh .",
    "direct computations on a mesh are easier to carry out , but they require very large mesh if a good quadrature rule is not used @xcite . as we will see , the lmm in momentum space is very easy to implement and can also give accurate results . in order to fix the notations , the eigenequations in momentum space are presented in sec .",

    "the kinetic operator is given by @xmath26 and the eigenvalue @xmath27 is the binding energy of the system . in a spinless salpeter hamiltonian , the kinetic operator takes the following form @xmath28 and the eigenvalue @xmath27 is the mass of the system .",
    "this kind of hamiltonian is sometimes denoted semirelativistic since it is not a covariant formulation .",
    "this equation can be considered as a schrdinger equation with its nonrelativistic kinetic part replaced by a relativistic counterpart .",
    "more rigorously , it is obtained from the covariant bethe - salpeter equation @xcite with the following approximations : elimination of any dependences on timelike variables and neglect of particle spin degrees of freedom as well as negative energy solutions @xcite .",
    "the spinless salpeter hamiltonian is often used in hadronic physics to study bound states of quarks or gluons @xcite .    within this formulation ,",
    "the action of the kinetic operator is just an ordinary multiplication .",
    "so , nonrelativistic and semirelativistic systems are computed with the same manner .",
    "moreover , more complicated kinetic parts , with momentum - dependent masses @xcite , can be equally treated .",
    "though the formulations in the configuration and momentum spaces are completely equivalent , this does not mean that the technical difficulties to solve the eigenequations are the same in both spaces .    if the potential is known in the configuration space , ( [ vftk ] ) and ( [ vlpq ] ) allows the computations of the partial potentials @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 can also be directly obtained from a physical theory , like a field theory naturally written in the momentum space .",

    "the @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the abscissae and the weights of a gauss quadrature formula @xmath38 several quadratures are possible , but , as we work with wavefunctions depending only on the module of a variable , we consider the case of the gauss - laguerre quadrature whose domain of interest is @xmath39 .",
    "the gauss formula ( [ gaussquad ] ) is exact when @xmath40 is a polynomial of degree @xmath41 at most , multiplied by @xmath42 .",
    "the mesh points @xmath36 are the zeros of a laguerre polynomial of degree @xmath31 : @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "these zeros can be determined with a high precision with usual methods to find the roots of a polynomial @xcite ( the _ mathematica _ expression ` root ` does efficiently the job ) or as the eigenvalues of a particular tridiagonal matrix @xcite .",
    "the weights can be computed by the following formula @xcite @xmath44    wavefunctions @xmath45 vanish at the origin .",
    "as it is not the case for the original lagrange functions , it is preferable to use the regularized lagrange functions whose explicit form is given by @xmath46 , that is to say @xcite @xmath47 such a function satisfies ( [ flm ] ) and @xmath48 ( see eq .  [ pexp2 ] ) .",
    "the use of the lmm in configuration space is described in @xcite .",
    "we will present here the formulation for the integral equation ( [ eigenp ] ) within the lmm .",

    "<S> the eigenfunctions are expanded in terms of regularized lagrange functions which vanish at all mesh points except one . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that this method can be adapted to solve eigenequations written in momentum space , keeping the convenience and the accuracy of the original technique . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the kinetic operator is a diagonal matrix . </S>",
    "<S> observables in both configuration space and momentum space can also be easily computed with a good accuracy using only eigenfunctions computed in the momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> the method is tested with gaussian and yukawa potentials , requiring respectively a small or a great mesh to reach convergence . </S>"
