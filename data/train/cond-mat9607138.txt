    "during the past few years there has been considerable interest in the transport properties of quantum dots@xcite .",
    "a quantum dot consists of a small metallic island , coupled to external leads by tunnel barriers . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "the energy associated with the addition of one electron to the dot ( i.e. the charging energy @xmath0 , with @xmath1 the total dot capacitance ) exceeds the thermal energy ( @xmath2 ) and the conductance of the dot is suppressed .",
    "this is the coulomb blockade of the conductance .",
    "it can be overcome by adjusting the electrostatic potential of the dot , which is conveniently achieved by varying the voltage @xmath3 of an external gate electrode . at certain values of @xmath3 the electrostatic energy of the dot containing",
    "@xmath4 electrons becomes equal to that for @xmath5 electrons . at these gate voltages transport",
    "becomes possible .",
    "this results in a periodic series of conductance peaks as a function of @xmath3 , known as coulomb oscillations .",
    "the coulomb oscillations can only be observed when the electrons are tightly confined to the quantum dot , i.e. when the conductances of the barriers connecting the dot to external leads are small .",
    "when the barrier height is decreased , the charge on the island becomes less well - defined due to quantum charge fluctuations and the coulomb blockade is smeared .",
    "this has been studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically@xcite in metalic systems which are characterized by a large number of channels connecting the island to the leads . in these systems",
    "the coulomb blockade is gradually reduced as the conductance is increased above the conductance quantum , @xmath6 .    for electrostatically defined dots in algaas heterostructures , the contacts to the leads",
    "are quantum point contacts with a small number of channels . in this case a fully opened contact has a conductance larger than @xmath6 and the coulomb blockade is found to disappear@xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has attracted much theoretical attention , since it proved possible to described this behaviour in terms of models know from one - dimensional interacting electron gases@xcite , so - called luttinger liquids .",
    "the studies of these non - fermi liquid many electron systems has recently gained new impetus because of its possible relevance to mesoscopic semiconductor structures , both in describing electron tunneling behavior@xcite and at low magnetic fields@xcite , as well as in quantum hall systems where the edge states has been suggested to be describable in terms of luttinger liquids@xcite . an interesting aspect of these suggestions is the possibility of observing effects such as power - law behaviors know from one - dimensional physics in systems which are not truly one - dimensional .",
    "the quantum dot connected to the leads by quantum point contacts may be mapped to a system of coupled one dimensional electron gases , luttinger liquids@xcite , and it can be argued that that the charging energy associated with the addition of an electron to the dot should scale with the conductance of the point - contact barriers , according to@xcite @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the bare charging energy and @xmath9 is the effective ( or `` renormalized '' ) charging energy observed for finite barrier conductance , @xmath10 the total number of quantum point contacts leading to the dot , and @xmath11 the transmission probability of each contact . here the transmission coefficients are assumed to be equal .",
    "for a situation with different @xmath11 s the scaling will be governed by the larger of the transmission coefficients .    in this paper",
    "we describe two experiments on a double quantum dot device that were designed to verify the validity of ref .",
    "[ scafor ] .",
    "first , we study the transition from single- to double - dot behaviour as a function of the transmission of the barrier seperating the two dots .",
    "second , in the double dot regime , we use one dot as an electrometer that measures the charging energy of the other dot .",
    "both experiments can be well modeled by using a standard rate equation approach for the coupled dot system , but with the important addition that we allow the effective energy gap to be modified according to eq .",
    "( [ scafor ] ) .",
    "part of this research was previously reported by us in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we enlarge the discussion and also present further experimental evidence for the interpretation in terms of the scaling law of eq .",
    "( [ scafor ] ) .",
    "recently , also waugh _ et al._@xcite reported an experiment which has been shown to be reflect one - dimensional physics@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : setup ] we describe the experimental realization and the operation principle of the coupled dot system , in sec .

    "to 8.0 cm to 8 cm    to 10.5 cm to 10.5 cm    the devices used in this study are fabricated from a ( al , ga)as modulation doped heterostructure that contains a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) of mobility @xmath12 @xmath13v@xmath14s@xmath14 and sheet carrier concentration @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "the nanostructures are defined electrostatically by split gates , structured using both optical and electron - beam lithography . a schematic lay - out of the device",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : layout ] .",
    "the diameter of each dot is about 1 @xmath17 m .",
    "all experiments are performed in the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator with a minimum base temperature of 20 mk ( we estimate the eletron gas temperature to be 150 mk ) .",
    "the device is designed to give a very large control over the device parameters since the conductance of all contacts can be adjusted .",
    "this means that conductance traces of the quantum dot can be taken for different values of the conductances of the relevant point contacts barriers .",
    "inevitably , there is some cross - talk between different gates which makes the determination of the contact resistances uncertain .",
    "we have included this effect in the error estimate of the first experiment .",
    "for the second experiment where we study the transition from one to two dots , the cross - talk give rise to an off - set that we determine by fitting to our model .",
    "in the experimental results that will be presented , we have measured the conductance @xmath18 between ohmic contacts 1 and 4 , using standard low - frequency lock - in techniques .",
    "our device can be operated as a semiconductor analogue of the metallic two - dot electrometer device described by lafarge et al.@xcite .",

    "what is measured is the dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath20 , the voltage on gate ii . in our double - dot device , scanning gate ii stepwise increases of the occupancy in both dot 1 and dot 2 , but with a much shorter stepsize ( in @xmath20 ) in dot 2 , because of the larger dot - to - gate capacitance .",
    "the trace in fig .",
    "[ fig : elmeter ] shows the conductance within a @xmath20-voltage range where @xmath21 only changes by 1 , whereas each superimposed sawtooth corresponds to the addition of one electron to dot 2 .",
    "it is then clear that the size of the sawteeth is a measure of the charging energy of dot 2 ; dot 1 thus acts as an electrometer@xcite that measures the changes in the potential of dot 2 . in the absence of a charging energy of dot 2 ,",
    "the conductance is given by usual coloumb oscillation peaks , which we have indicated with the dashed line ( obtained by setting @xmath22 in the equations below ) .",
    "the full curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : elmeter ] is , in fact , a fit to an experimental trace ( dotted curve ) , using a theory we will discuss below .",
    "subtraction of the dashed and the full line gives the trace shown in the top panel of the figure .",

    "we are able to fit the experimental curves and this fitting procedure is used to determine an effective charging energy for dot in sec .",
    "[ sec : fitting ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the theoretical modelling that we use .",
    "we apply the standard electrostatic model for the interaction energy and use a rate equation approach to solve for the conductance of the device .",
    "then we incorporate the charge fluctuations in our model by introducing a renormalized charging energy .",
    "the electrostatic energy of our double dot system can be found by considering the various capacitances involved .",

    "( [ edelta ] ) that the _ period of the coulomb oscillations is uneffected by quantum fluctuations_. this is because if the hamiltonian is given by @xmath57 ( here @xmath58 is the single electron hamiltonian ) it is not changed when changing @xmath59 by one apart from adding a constant to the energy and changing the corresponding average number of electrons by one . therefore ,",
    "changing the gate voltage such that the average number of electrons in one of the dots is increased by one does not change the transport properties .",
    "thus , the spacing of the peak structures are determined by the electrostatics of the system , and only the widths and amplitudes of the peaks are altered by an increase of the number fluctuations .",
    "we will model this by invoking a renormalized charging energy @xmath60 as described in the following two subsections .",
    "this renormalized charging energy is then inserted into eq .  ( [ g ] ) and",
    "we have a new expression for the conductance which takes the quantum fluctuations into account @xmath61 where @xmath62      in one of our experiments the charge on dot 2 is allowed to fluctuate ( sec . [",
    "sec : flucn2exp ] ) by lowering the barriers bc and de .",
    "the resulting increase in variations of @xmath63 will be modelled by using a renormalized value for the charging energy that controls the deviation away from the optimum number of electrons on dot 2 .",

    "now in the case where the charge difference @xmath73 exhibit quantum fluctuations it may be modeled by renormalizing the charging energy associated with changes in @xmath73 .",
    "this leads to the model for the renormalized energy @xmath74",
    "to 12 cm to 12 cm    we will now discuss an experiment that measures the scaling behavior of @xmath76 with the conductance of barriers @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in the left panel of fig .",
