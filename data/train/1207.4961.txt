    "parallel pump strength has been fixed to @xmath141 while transverse pump strength has been ramped up from zero at @xmath146 to @xmath152 at @xmath151 and then both of pumps are turned off when the spin lattice has taken a well - defined shape .",

    "we conclude that a bec with two non - degenerate hyperfine spin components in a high - finesse cavity driven by a transverse pump can exhibit raman superradiance above a critical value of the transverse field strength . simultaneously , bec undergoes a phase transition , associated both with the external and internal degrees of freedom , during which atoms scatter transverse laser field into the cavity mode and in return their hyperfine state changes . as a result ,",
    "cavity photon number rises abruptly and at the same time there is a sudden increase in the population of higher hyperfine state at periodic positions exhibiting a magnetic lattice configuration .",
    "an extra laser pump parallel to the cavity axis can be used in order to synthesize sharper lattices and the lattice remains robust after turning both laser pumps off . even though present analysis is in the mean - field regime",
    ", we can envision that hyperfine spins at different lattice sites would be entangled as they interact with the common cavity field , following the resonant entanglement of atoms in multitraps scenario @xcite .",
    "availability of large number of spins per site could make the system advantageous for explorations of magnetic supersolid properties .",
    "in contrast to rayleigh superradiance , raman superradiance can be used as a source of entangled photon - spin pairs .",
    "application of cold atoms in optical lattices for quantum information purposes has been a developing field of theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "in addition to optical lattices , spin systems are commonly considered for quantum information bits ( qubits ) and associated quantum information processing .",
    "our treatment brings optical lattices and spin lattices together in a compact and controllable cavity - qed environment . synthesis and probing robust spin lattice models , with fast",
    "superradiance induced phase transition and self - organization properties promise unique opportunities for quantum information applications as well as monitoring phase transitions and spin correlations with raman scheme .",
    "long range spin - spin interactions induced by the cavity field can be utilized on optical spin lattice created in the cavity .",
    "large spin values at the sites together with the coherence from the underlying condensate can be useful for quantum memory as well as information processing .",
    "moreover , leaking photons from the cavity and external drives can be used for non - destructive probing and accessing the system .",
