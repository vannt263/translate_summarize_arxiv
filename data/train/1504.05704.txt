    "these molecules are efficiently formed in the gas phase , close to the stellar photosphere as a consequence of chemical processes enabled under thermodynamical equilibrium @xcite . in the dust formation region ( @xmath2520 ) , the si - bearing molecules are likely to condense onto the dust grains due to their highly refractory nature .",
    "the silicon contained in the dust grains can form molecules through grain - surface reactions . also , the interaction of shocks produced by the pulsation of the star with the dust grains can extract certain amounts of silicon from the grains and incorporate that silicon into the gas - phase to react and form other species ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . beyond this region , the abundances of si - bearing molecules",
    "are expected to decrease up to the outermost shells of the envelope , where the interstellar ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation field dissociates all the remaining molecules .",

    "recent observations with the combined array for research in millimeter - wave astronomy ( carma ) of the sis @xmath3=14  13 v=0 and v=1 lines have been reported by @xcite , where the v=0 line shows a circular and compact brightness distribution of @xmath22  and displays maser emission .",

    "detailed information of each setup is summarized in table[tab : obs ] .",
    "the observations were performed using sixteen antennas covering baselines up to 402 m that allowed us to obtain an angular resolution of @xmath20.6 .",
    "the shortest baselines used were @xmath220 m which allow us to recover structures with a size up to @xmath1112 .",

    "the continuum comes from a point - like source located at @xmath13=9@xmath1447@xmath1557446 and @xmath16=13@xmath416@xmath174386(j2000 ) , which is in good agreement with the position of irc+10216 measured with the very large array ( vla ) with 40 mas resolution @xcite .",

    "in figs.[fig : si - bear ] and [ fig:29sio ] , we show maps of the emission of the lines sic@xmath0 @xmath19=11@xmath20  10@xmath21 , @xmath7sio @xmath3=6  5 and @xmath7sis @xmath3=15  14 in their ground vibrational state at different offset velocities with respect to the systemic velocity of the source .",

    "sw direction with a size of @xmath245  along the nebular axis and @xmath234  in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the elongation is also observed in the @xmath7sio emission ( see below ) and in the sio and sic@xmath0 maps by @xcite where the authors invoke a possible bipolar outflow to explain it . at the systemic velocity of the source and at + 6  offset , a ringlike , clumpy and weak component is seen at @xmath21011  from the central star .",
    "the angular distance between the position of the star and the ring structure , considering a distance of @xmath2130pc to the star from us @xcite , corresponds to a linear distance of @xmath22@xmath2210@xmath23 cm .",
    "this ringlike component is consistent with the peak abundance of sic@xmath0 in the outer envelope of irc+10216 reported in @xcite and the chemical model of @xcite .",
    "although , this ringlike structure is probably filtered in our data given the shortest baselines used . between the central and the ringlike structure , emission of sic@xmath1 is either very low or absent @xcite .",
    "finally , the redshifted emission ( + 12 ) displays a quasi - circular distribution with a diameter of @xmath256 .",
    "these brightness distributions could be interpreted as the sic@xmath1 is formed in regions close to the star , then it condenses onto the dust grains , and eventually it reappears at the outer shells of the cse , perhaps as a hollow shell , as the consequence of the interaction between the uv galactic radiation field and the cse @xcite .    for @xmath7sio ( figs.[fig : si - bear ] and [ fig:29sio ] ) , the bulk of the emission arises from a compact central component with a size of 2 .",

    "sw direction with a size of @xmath234 .",
    "the blueshifted emission at -13  displays a decrease just in front of the star , which can be interpreted as self - absorption and probably absorption of the continuum emission mostly coming from the star .",
    "there is no conclusive explanation for the elongation ; nevertheless , some authors pointed out that it could evidence the presence of a bipolar outflow in the cse @xcite .",
    "the possible presence of a binary companion to cwleo could also play a decisive role in this scenario @xcite .",
    "the observed brightness distributions of the vibrationally excited sis lines are expected to be compact and centered on the star since the involved levels are excited at the high temperatures prevailing close to the star . the sis @xmath3=15  14 v=0 line , which displays maser emission @xcite , shows a circular brightness distribution with a diameter of @xmath22  at the systemic velocity of the source . for the sis @xmath3=15  14 v@xmath241 lines , the observed distributions are not spatially resolved .",

    " 14 v=0 line , which displays a brightness distribution of a compact source surrounding the central star with a diameter of @xmath22 .",
    "a large - scale artificial modulation can be seen below the 25@xmath25 level .",
    "since it is related to the visibilities at short baselines , we do not expect it to modify the shape and flux of the compact central component of the brightness distribution . also , the quality of the several sis and @xmath7sis maps is affected owing to the low uv coverage and non - neglible contribution of the sidelobes for the setups 35 ( see table[tab : obs ] ) . the lines that lie in the range covered by the setup 6 , are those of high vibrationally excited states ( e.g. sis @xmath3=15 ",
    "14 v@xmath2410 , @xmath7sis @xmath3=15  14 v@xmath246 ) which are tentative and spatially unresolved .",
    "[ a ]    [ b ]    [ c ]      the cycle0 observations with alma allowed us to detect several @xmath3=15  14 lines of high vibrationally excited states of sis isotopologues , in particular , up to v=7 for the main isotopologue ( see fig.[fig : sis_all ] ) .",
    "the sis @xmath3=15  14 v=8 and v=10 lines are probably blended with unidentified lines , so we consider them to be tentative .",
    "additionally , the sis @xmath3=15  14 v=9 line is considered tentatively detected because even though its fwhm measured seems to follow the trend shown in fig.[fig : sis_all ] , its measured integrated intensity is underestimated considering the population diagram of fig.[fig : sis_all ] .",
    "all these lines display a compact unresolved emission peaking at the central star .",
    "the fwhm of the lines measured from the spectra at the stellar position decreases with increasing upper level energy ( see fig.[fig : sis_all ] ) .",
    "we verified this behavior for sis , @xmath7sis , @xmath8sis , si@xmath9s and si@xmath10s . in the dust formation region ,",
    "the gas displays a velocity gradient as a function of the radial distance to the star , i.e. , the closer to the star the lower the expansion velocity ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein )",
    ". hence , those lines involving higher vibrational states , which are excited in inner and warmer regions , are narrower .",
    "thermal broadening for the sis lines excited in the dust formation region is @xmath21 , and thus this mechanism could only account partially for the fwhm variation of the lines .",
    "we analyzed the excitation conditions of sis with the rotational diagram technique @xcite using the spectra at the stellar position ( see fig.[fig : sis_all ] ) .",
    "we considered two different linear trends for the observational data : one for the transitions with e@xmath26@xmath112500k ( i.e. v=0 , 1 and 2 ) , and a different trend for the rest ( i.e. v=37 ) .",
    "the v@xmath248 lines are excluded from the fit .",
    "the values derived from the v=0 to v=2 fit are uncertain owing to the maser nature of the sis @xmath3=15  14 v=0 line and also due to possible optically thick emission .",
    "both data series show a linear behavior consistent with a single vibrational ( excitation ) temperature for each of the fits .",
    "the vibrational temperature derived from the fit involving the transitions in high - energy vibrational states is higher than the temperature derived for the low vibrational levels .",
    "therefore , the emission produced by sis transitions in high - energy vibrational states can only arise from regions close to the photosphere .",
    "this result is similar to the one obtained by @xcite for hcn .",
    "we used a large velocity gradient ( lvg ) code to model the sis emission @xcite .",
    "further details about the spectroscopic data used in the calculations are given in ",
    "[ sec : vibmom ] .",
    "the sis collisional data were taken from @xcite and extrapolated to high rovibrational levels .",
    "we adopted a distance to the star of @xmath2130pc , an effective temperature of @xmath22330k and a stellar radius of @xmath24@xmath2210@xmath27 cm as input for our model @xcite .",
    "we used two different models : ( @xmath5 ) the model of @xcite , which was used to reproduce the molecular abundances in the inner layers of irc+10216 , that we call the `` 2012 model '' , and , ( @xmath6 ) this work , which is a modification of the model ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we modified the h@xmath0 density , decreasing it by a factor @xmath22 , as described in @xcite ( this was used to reproduce the dust nucleation zone , 110 , of irc+10216 ) .",
    "additionally , the sis abundance in the dust nucleation zone needs to be balanced with a similar increase ( factor of @xmath22 ) to avoid an underestimation of the sis emission . from these models ( see fig.[fig : sis_all ] ) we obtain a good agreement with the vibrational temperature derived from the vibrational diagram and moderate discrepancies with the total column density within a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "these discrepancies in the column density may be explained by the dilution due to the size of the emitting region compared to the half power beam width of the synthetic beam , which would increase the optical depth of the lines .",
    "the size of the emitting region should decrease with the vibrational state owing to the energies needed to excite those lines . with our models , we found moderate to high optical depths @xmath28(v=1)@xmath210 to @xmath28(v=4)@xmath20.8 for the abundance profile ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath28(v=1)@xmath247 to @xmath28(v=8)@xmath21.0 for the abundance profile ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "@xmath38 @xmath39    the potential parameters were obtained by nonlinear least squares fitting to the observed infrared and microwave line positions of the sis isotopologues up to v=12 .",
    "the final data set included a total of 2863 lines , 414 rotational transitions @xcite and 2449 rovibrational transitions @xcite .",
    "mass - independent dunham coefficients , u@xmath40 , have been derived by @xcite .",
    "the fit to the potential energy function was performed using the levenberg ",
    "marquardt algorithm @xcite to minimize the @xmath41 function , with the line positions weighted by the square of the experimental uncertainties .",
    "the rovibrational energy levels of the isotopologues needed to calculate the line positions were computed by solving the radial schrdinger equation using the variational method of @xcite along with harmonic - type basis functions .",
    "the potential parameters obtained in the fit are given in the comments of the table[vdip ] .",
    "the final @xmath41 value was 1.767 .",
    "the unweighted standard deviations for the rotational and , vibrational - rotational line positions were 0.0229mhz and 0.000657cm@xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the dipole moment function used for sis was determined semiempirically by @xcite , and the dipole moment matrix elements were computed up to v=4 . in table[vdip ] we provide them up to v=12 .",
    "the agreement between our calculations and those of @xcite for v@xmath434 is excellent .",
    "sic was detected in irc+10216 by @xcite with line profiles indicating that the molecule was produced in an external shell , probably as a product of the photodissociation of sic@xmath0 .",
    "our observations did not cover any frequency range where sic lines could arise ; however , lines of @xmath7sic and sic v=1 lie in this range , but they were not detected .",
    "for a temperature in the photosphere of 2300k a significant number of sic molecules could be in the v=1 state ( e@xmath44@xmath21400k ) and higher vibrational levels .",
    "we derived an upper limit to the sic column density of 4.4@xmath2210@xmath45@xmath46 from the @xmath7sic upper limit , where we used an isotopic @xmath47si/@xmath7si ratio of 20 @xcite .",
