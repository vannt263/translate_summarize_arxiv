    "the study of hadronic physics has been a subject of intense interest .",
    "there are many hadronic states reported in recent years : @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16 @xcite , @xmath17 @xcite and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "more and more states will be discovered in the near future .",
    "however , the properties of some states such as @xmath3 are still not very clear .",
    "@xmath3 was reported as the doubly charmed baryon state by selex in two different decay modes @xcite , but the @xmath2 number has not been determined .",
    "moreover , it has not been confirmed by other experiments ( notably by babar @xcite , belle @xcite and focus @xcite ) . according to the particle data group s `` review of particle physics '' in 2006 @xcite , many hadrons , especially heavy hadrons ,",
    "are still absent from the summary tables .",
    "obviously , there is still a lot of work to be done both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the eightfold way and the standard su(3 ) gell - mann  okubo ( gmo ) formula @xcite have played an important role in the historical progress in particle physics . however , the direct generalization of the gmo formula to the charmed and bottom hadrons can not agree well with experimental data due to higher - order breaking effects . consequently , there are many works focused on the mass relations , including inequalities @xcite and equalities @xcite .    quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has been verified as an appropriate theory to describe strong interaction at short distances .",
    "however , the application of qcd to the processes of hadronic interactions at large distances is still limited by the unsolved confinement problem . nowadays calculations of hadronic properties , which are related to the nonperturbative effects , are frequently carried out with the help of phenomenological models .",
    "regge phenomenology ( which was derived from the analysis of the properties of the scattering amplitude in the complex angular momentum plane @xcite ) is one of the simplest ones among these phenomenological models .",
    "regge theory is concerned with almost all aspects of strong interactions , including the particle spectra , the forces between particles , and the high energy behavior of scattering amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the quasilinear regge trajectory ansatz , which is one of the most effective and popular approaches for studying hadron spectra , can ( at least at present ) give a reasonable description for the hadron spectroscopy @xcite , although some suggestions that the realistic regge trajectories could be nonlinear exist @xcite .    as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , regge intercepts and slopes are useful for many spectral and nonspectral purposes , for example , in the recombination @xcite and fragmentation @xcite models . therefore , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the slopes and intercepts of the regge trajectories are fundamental constants of hadron dynamics , perhaps in general more important than the masses of particular states .",
    "thus , the determination of regge slopes and intercepts of hadrons is of great importance since this provides opportunities for a better understanding of the dynamics of strong interactions @xcite . in the quasilinear regge trajectory ansatz",
    ", the numerical values of the parameters of the regge trajectories were extracted for mesons of different flavors @xcite . under the approximation that mesons or baryons in the light quark sector have the common regge slopes , burakovsky _ et al .",
    "_ derived two 6th power and one 14th power meson mass relations in ref .",
    "@xcite , and derived some new quadratic gell - mann  okubo  type baryon mass equalities in ref .",
    "@xcite . using those new quadratic baryon mass relations they predicted the masses of @xmath4 and @xmath5 charmed baryon states absent from the baryon summary table then .",
    "( here and below , @xmath4 and @xmath5 multiplets refer to the ground multiplets in which the total orbital angular momenta @xmath19=0 . )",
    "however , the numerical values for the parameters of the charmed baryon regge trajectories were not given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work , under the assumption that the quasilinear regge trajectory ansatz is suitable to describe meson spectra and baryon spectra with the requirements of the additivity of intercepts and inverse slopes , the relations between slope ratios and masses of hadrons with different flavors and the mass relations among hadrons will be studied .",
    "we will show that the linear mass gmo formula is virtually an inequality and the quadratic mass gmo formula is also an inequality with the sign opposite to the linear case .",
    "we will get a high - power mass equation which is very useful to predict the masses of @xmath0 states and the masses of pure @xmath1 states .",
    "we will also get some useful quadratic mass equations for baryons .",
    "the @xmath2 assignment of @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 baryons will be discussed .",
    "the numerical values for the parameters of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 trajectories will be extracted and the masses of the baryon states lying on the @xmath4 and @xmath5 trajectories will be estimated .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly introduce the quasilinear regge trajectory ansatz .",
    "then , we extract the mass inequalities and mass equalities for mesons and baryons . in sec .",
    "iii we present some applications of the relations derived in sec .",
    "ii and discuss the @xmath2 assignment of @xmath3 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 baryons .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 trajectories are extracted and the masses of the baryon states lying on the @xmath4 and @xmath5 trajectories are estimated .",
    "finally , we give a discussion and conclusion in sec .",
    "it is known from regge theory that all mesons and baryons are associated with regge poles which move in the complex angular momentum plane as a function of energy .",
    "the trajectory of a particular pole ( regge trajectory ) is characterized by a set of internal quantum numbers ( baryon number @xmath20 , intrinsic parity @xmath21 , strangeness @xmath22 , charmness @xmath23 , bottomness @xmath24 , etc . ) and by the evenness or oddness of the total spin @xmath25 for mesons ( @xmath26 for baryons ) @xcite .",
    "the plots of regge trajectories of hadrons in the @xmath27 plane are usually called chew - frautschi plots ( where @xmath25 and @xmath28 are respectively the total spins and the masses of the hadrons ) . in fig . 1",
    ", we draw the chew - frautschi plots for some meson and baryon regge trajectories .",
    "chew - frautschi plots in the ( @xmath29 ) plane for some mesons and baryons .    assuming the existence of the quasilinear regge trajectories for both light and heavy hadrons",
    ", one can have @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are respectively the intercept and slope of the trajectory on which the particles lie .",
    "hadrons lying on the same regge trajectory which have the same internal quantum numbers are classified into the same family .",
    "the difference between the total spins of these hadrons is @xmath33 ( @xmath34=1,2,3,@xmath35 ) , e.g. , mesons with the quantum numbers @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath35 ( where @xmath39 , @xmath19 and @xmath40 denote the radial excited quantum number , the orbital quantum number and the intrinsic spin , respectively ) lying on the same regge trajectory .",
    "these features can be seen from the well - known chew - frautschi plots ( fig .",
    "1 ) .    for a meson multiplet with spin - parity @xmath2 ( more exactly speaking , with quantum numbers @xmath36 ) ,",
    "the parameters for different quark constituents can be related by the following relations :    the additivity of intercepts @xcite , @xmath41    the additivity of inverse slopes @xcite , @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 represent quark flavors .",
    "equations ( [ intercept1 ] ) and ( [ slope1a ] ) were derived in a model based on the topological expansion and the @xmath45-string picture of hadrons @xcite .",
    "this model provides a microscopic approach to describe regge phenomenology in terms of quark degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ intercept1 ] )",
    "was first derived for light quarks in the dual - resonance model @xcite , and was found to be satisfied in two - dimensional qcd @xcite , the dual - analytic model @xcite , and the quark bremsstrahlung model @xcite . also , it saturates the inequality for regge intercepts @xcite which follows from the schwarz inequality and the unitarity relation .",
    "the above two relations are usually generalized to the baryon case @xcite , in which one has @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 represents a quark .",
    "there are also relations about the factorization of slopes for mesons @xcite and baryons @xcite : @xmath49 @xmath50 which follow from the factorization of residues of the @xmath51-channel poles .",
    "the paper by burakovsky and goldman @xcite showed that only the additivity of inverse regge slopes is consistent with the formal chiral and heavy quark limits for both mesons and baryons , and that the factorization of regge slopes , although consistent with the formal chiral limit , fails in the heavy quark limit .",
    "besides , in sec .",
    "iii b , we will show that the high - power equation ( [ high - equal - factor ] ) derived from the relations ( [ regge1 ] ) , ( [ intercept1 ] ) and ( [ factorization - slope - m ] ) is not as good as the high - power equation ( [ high - equal - m ] ) derived from the relations ( [ regge1 ] ) , ( [ intercept1 ] ) and ( [ slope1a ] ) compared with the well - established meson multiplets .",
    "therefore , we will use the relations ( [ slope1a ] ) and ( [ slope1b ] ) ( the additivity of inverse slopes ) rather than the relations ( [ factorization - slope - m ] ) and ( [ factorization - slope - b ] ) ( the factorization of slopes ) in this study .",
    "there are also studies about the relations between the ground state and its radial excited states @xcite and there are suggestions that the radial excited states lie on daughter trajectories of the ground state @xcite . however , we do not discuss these relations in the present work .      for mesons , using eqs .",
    "( [ regge1 ] ) and ( [ intercept1 ] ) , one obtains @xmath52 where the meson states @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 belong to the same @xmath56 multiplet . this relation can be reduced to the quadratic gell - mann  okubo - type formula by assuming that all the slopes are independent of flavors ( @xmath57 ) . combining the relations ( [ slope1a ] ) and ( [ combination1 ] )",

    "the deviations from both of them are not more than 2@xmath375 .",

    "( [ 2-order - okubo - quadr - univ ] ) should give very different mass values for heavy baryons .",
    "the masses of the charmed and bottom particles discovered in the near future will numerically test which of them is realized in nature .",
    "theoretically , we also have some reasons besides the regge theory to believe that mass formulas for mesons and baryons should take the quadratic form rather than the linear form : 1 ) the square of the mass operator ( @xmath543 ) is the casimir invariant of the poincare group independent of any certain frame @xcite ; 2 ) formulas given by asymptotic chiral symmetry are indeed in quadratic form @xcite ; 3 ) in the infinite - momentum frame , formulas between energy eigenvalues of hadrons spontaneously lead to quadratic mass formulas @xcite ; 4 ) analysis on the algebraic approach indeed leads to quadratic mass formulas @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that the quadratic mass formula can be approximately written as the relevant linear mass formula when the mass splittings between the hadrons of the formula are small compared with the hadron masses @xcite .",
    "to sum up , we conclude that quasilinear regge trajectory and the additivity of intercepts and inverse slopes are indeed suitable to describe meson spectra and baryon spectra at present . the mass relations and the predictions may be useful for the discovery of the unobserved meson and baryon states and the @xmath2 assignment of the meson and baryon states which will be observed in the future .",
