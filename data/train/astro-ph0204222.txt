    "dust infrared ( ir ) luminosity is a familiar indicator of the current star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "especially , the most active star - forming galaxies ( e.g. , arp 220 ) emit almost all their radiation energy in the ir range @xcite . for such galaxies , @xcite derived a conversion formula from the ir luminosity to the sfr by assuming the ir luminosity equal to the bolometric luminosity and 10100 myr continuous star formation ( hereafter k98 ir formula ) .",
    "more recently , inoue , hirashita , & kamaya ( 2000 ; hereafter ihk00 ) theoretically constructed a new conversion law from ir to sfr , which we can apply not only to dusty starbursts but also to normal ( or quiescent ) galaxies .",
    "although the sfrs determined from various indicators should agree with each other , we often find discrepancies among them .",
    "thus , many authors try to resolve such discrepancies @xcite . in this context",
    ", the sfr from the ir luminosity via k98 ir formula is assumed to be the correct sfr in spite of the fact that k98 ir formula can be applied to only dusty starbursts in principle @xcite .",
    "indeed , the sfr via k98 ir formula shows a good agreement with that from the h@xmath5 luminosity even for samples of normal galaxies if we correct the h@xmath5 luminosity for the dust extinction in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , that in h ii regions , and the stellar balmer absorption @xcite .",
    "also , an empirical conversion factor into the sfr from the ir luminosity for normal late - type spiral galaxies agrees with that of k98 ir formula within a factor of 2 @xcite .",
    "why can k98 ir formula present the correct sfr even for normal galaxies ?    in this letter , we examine what types of galaxies k98 ir formula is applicable to , and how much correction factor against the formula is required to obtain a more precise sfr . in  2 , we formulate the relation between the ir luminosity and the star formation ( sf ) luminosity . in  3 ,",
    "we describe a model of dust extinction of galaxies . in  4 ,",
    "we show that the ratio of the ir luminosity to the sf luminosity becomes of order unity within a factor of 2 for a very wide parameter area , and many nearby galaxies really fall in this area .",
    "following ihk00 , we formulate the relation between the observed ir luminosity of a galaxy , @xmath0 , and the intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the newly ( @xmath1 10 myr ) formed stellar population ( hereafter sf population ) , @xmath2 .",
    "the ir luminosity of a galaxy is expressed by the following : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are luminosities of lyman @xmath5 photons generated in h ii regions , lyman continuum ( lc ) photons and nonionizing ( @xmath11  ) photons emitted by the sf population , and photons from underlying stellar population , respectively .",
    "the parameters , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are a fraction of lc photons contributing to hydrogen ionization , an efficiency of the dust extinction for nonionizing photons from the sf population , and that for photons from underlying population . here , we assume that all lyman @xmath5 photons are eventually absorbed by dust during a number of resonance scatterings in the ism .",
    "we neglect the escape of lc photons from a galaxy , the consumption of lc photons by helium ionization , any extinctions for hydrogen s recombination lines within h ii regions except for lyman @xmath5 , and the contribution to the ir luminosity by agn activity .    according to the kurucz atlas 9 stellar spectra with solar metallicity and a turbulence speed of 2 km s@xmath15 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath16 and @xmath17 if the salpeter imf ( 0.1100 @xmath18 ) is assumed . since about two - thirds of the ionization - recombination processes produce lyman @xmath5 photons under case b @xcite , we also obtain @xmath19 . here",
    ", we note that only a fraction @xmath12 of lc photons ionize hydrogen .",
    "moreover , we introduce a new parameter , @xmath20 , to represent the intrinsic stellar luminosity fraction of the sf population to all stellar population ; @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "this parameter is an indicator of the star - forming activity .",
    "therefore , equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath23    for dusty starbursts ( @xmath24 ) , the right hand side of equation ( [ eq2 ] ) becomes unity since the dust opacity is enough high to absorb all photons emitted by stars ( i.e. @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) . in principle , k98 ir formula can be applied to only such galaxies . on the other hand ,",
    "if we determine all four parameters ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath20 ) , we can convert the observed ir luminosity of all kinds of galaxies to the sf luminosity , and then , to the current sfr .",
    "this is the algorithm of ihk00 .",
    "here , we describe a model of dust extinction to determine the values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) .",
    "we will discuss in  4.2 the effect of the choice of a specific extinction law on our result .",
    "following @xcite ( especially their fig .  1 ) , we consider , first , two types of dust extinction .",
    "one is the extinction by diffuse ism dust ( @xmath27 ) , and the other is by dust accompanying the birth clouds of young stars ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "then , we assume @xmath29 and @xmath30 for @xmath31  , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are adopted , so as to reproduce the observed relation between uv flux slope and luminosity ratio of ir to uv for nearby star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "we define the dust optical depth for the sf population as @xmath35 .    for simplicity , we assume that the dust geometry is an uniform screen ( or the optical depth defined above is an effective one ) . then , we define @xmath13 as an average of @xmath36 over the age range of 0  10 myr , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the luminosity density of a simple stellar population ( ssp ) with an age @xmath39 .",
    "we use ssps produced by p ' egase 2.0 @xcite throughout this letter . in the same way",
    ", we define @xmath14 as an average of @xmath40 over the age of 10 myr  15 gyr but @xmath41 is replaced with @xmath42 .",
    "the obtained @xmath13 and @xmath14 are a function of only @xmath43 , the normalization of the adopted extinction law .",
    "let us introduce one more type of dust extinction to determine the parameter @xmath12 , lyman continuum extinction ( inoue , hirashita , & kamaya 2001 , inoue 2001 ) , which is the extinction for lc photons by dust in h ii regions before lc photons ionize neutral hydrogens . the parameter @xmath12 is determined from the dust optical depth for lc photons in h ii regions , @xmath44 , via eq .",
    "( 8) in @xcite .",
    "here , we assume a scaling law between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "now , we attempt to estimate @xmath47 from real data .",
    "we have shown that @xmath44 is proportional to the dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath48 , in @xcite . here ,",
    "we adopt the relation , @xmath49 @xcite , where @xmath50 is a typical galactic value @xcite .",
    "we estimated @xmath48 for seven nearby spiral galaxies observed by iso @xcite in @xcite .",
    "the mean value is @xmath51 .",
    "by @xcite is estimated from the analysis of the extinction properties for a number of line of sights , which is different from our method . ] on the other hand , we can estimate the dust optical depth from the ir surface brightness . by neglecting the self - absorption of the ir photons and assuming the obtained optical depth to correspond to that in the diffuse ism , we obtain @xmath52 as a mean dust optical depth for these seven galaxies , where we adopt the dust emissivity determined by @xcite .",
    "therefore , we obtain @xmath53 .    although the real relation between @xmath44 and @xmath43 is quite uncertain , we find in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) that the effect of @xmath12 on the ratio @xmath54 is small . indeed",
    ", the effect of the deviation from @xmath55 on the @xmath56 is at most @xmath57 .",
    "now , we can determine @xmath54 from only two parameters ; a mean dust opacity ( @xmath58 ) and a star - forming activity ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "we survey these parameters space to clarify when we can determine the sfr from @xmath0 within a factor of 2 uncertainty via k98 ir formula , i.e. , when @xmath59 is satisfied .    in figure 1 , we show some constant @xmath54 lines in the @xmath58-@xmath20 plane . we define the applicable area as the parameter area satisfying the condition @xmath59 .",
    "the applicable area is between two thick lines in figure 1 since the upper thick line is the case of @xmath60 and the lower one is the case of @xmath61 .",
    "also , the thin line in figure 1 represents the case of @xmath62 .",
    "we find that the applicable area is very wide in the @xmath63-@xmath20 plane .",
    "this is a main conclusion in this letter .    for a galaxy with an exponentially declining star formation history ( sfh ) of @xmath64 10 gyr time scale , age of @xmath64 1 gyr , and salpeter imf , we find that @xmath65 .",
    "thus , many spiral and irregular galaxies are likely to fall in the applicable area. in order to examine whether real galaxies fall in the applicable area or not , we will estimate their @xmath20 and @xmath58 in the following .",
    "then , we will discuss implications from our results .",
    "first , we estimate @xmath20 of galaxies from the observed equivalent width of h @xmath5 emission line corrected for dust and stellar absorption effects . by the definition of @xmath20",
    ", we can express @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the intrinsic equivalent width of h @xmath5 emission line , @xmath68 is the intrinsic ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the h @xmath5 emission line luminosity of the sf population , and @xmath69 is the intrinsic ratio of the bolometric luminosity to the luminosity density at @xmath70-band of all stellar population .",
    "if we specify the metallicity and imf of galaxies , the value of @xmath71 is determined from only the electron temperature and density in h ii regions under case b approximation . on the contrary ,",
    "the value of @xmath69 depends on the sfh and age of galaxies as well as the metallicity and imf .",
    "we examine the evolution of @xmath69 with the galactic age , so that we find that the factor @xmath72 falls in the range of 0.002  0.004 unless we consider a galaxy younger than a few gyr or a galaxy with a short ( @xmath1 1 gyr ) exponential time scale .",
    "thus , we adopt a constant 0.003 as @xmath72 , which corresponds to the case of solar metallicity , exponentially declining sfh with 10 gyr time scale , and about 13 gyr age . here , we do not take into account the chemical enrichment effect .    therefore , we estimate @xmath20 from the following equation approximately ; @xmath73 where the second case is needed due to @xmath74 by its definition . in the real case ,",
    "the value of @xmath20 asymptotically approaches unity by decreasing the factor @xmath72 , when @xmath67 increases .",
    "thus , we overestimate @xmath20 for a galaxy with a very large @xmath67 .",
    "however , the real value of @xmath20 is about unity for such galaxies . on the other hand",
    ", we underestimate @xmath20 for a galaxy with a very small @xmath67 .",
    "we confirm that this effect is also not so large ( at most factor of 2 ) .",
    "although the effect of the change of the metallicity on @xmath75 is small , that of the imf slope is large . if we choose the imf slope of 1.35 ( salpeter s slope is 2.35 ) , a typical @xmath72 decreases an order of magnitude , about 0.0003 . in the case of the slope of 3.35 , we find @xmath76 typically",
    "this is because a top - heavy imf ( 1.35 slope ) results in a smaller fraction of the @xmath70-band luminosity density in the bolometric luminosity since massive stars do not contribute to the @xmath70-band light so effectively .",
    "a steep imf provides an opposite result .",
    "now , we must estimate the intrinsic equivalent width , @xmath77 , from the observed one , @xmath78 .",
    "assuming that the underlying stellar population ( age @xmath64 10 myr ) dominates the @xmath70-band continuum and the stellar balmer absorption , we can express @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the equivalent width of the stellar absorption , and @xmath81  .",
    "the factor @xmath82 means that only a fraction @xmath12 of lc photons is used to ionize neutral hydrogen atoms .",
    "next , we estimate @xmath83 from the balmer decrement corrected for the stellar absorption by assuming @xmath84  , which noted by @xcite as a typical value , and then , we convert the obtained @xmath83 into @xmath58 by using the parameter @xmath32 ( see  3 ) . here , we also assume the electron temperature of @xmath85 k and case b. once the optical depth @xmath58 is obtained , we can estimate @xmath12 parameter , @xmath67 from @xmath78 , and then , @xmath20 .",
    "the obtained values of @xmath58 are systematically smaller than but roughly consistent with those determined from the uv slope method @xcite for sample galaxies described below .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath58 from the balmer decrement is large , @xmath86 . as a result ,",
    "the uncertainty of the obtained @xmath20 is @xmath86 , which is estimated from a simple monte carlo simulation if we do not take account of the uncertainties of the adopted parameters of the dust extinction law ( i.e. , @xmath14 , @xmath47 , and @xmath87 in  3 ) .",
    "also , we find that a random error of @xmath58 causes a somewhat overestimation of @xmath20 . to display this point , we show a typical error bar in figure 1 .",
    "in addition , we select only galaxies with enough strong h @xmath88 emission line to obtain a reliable balmer decrement . thus , our sample galaxies are biased towards larger @xmath20 .",
    "one might think that the parameter @xmath20 can be estimated from the ratio of the uv luminosity and the @xmath70 or @xmath89-band luminosity . however , we can do it reasonably only if we specify the sfh and age of galaxies .",
    "that is , the coefficient between @xmath20 and @xmath90 or @xmath91 varies together with the galactic age significantly .",
    "this is because a significant fraction of the uv light originates in the underlying stellar population with its age of @xmath64 10 myr . on the contrary ,",
    "the ionizing photons producing the h @xmath5 photons originate in almost only the sf population ( its age @xmath1 10 myr ) .",
    "therefore , we estimated @xmath20 from the equivalent width of the h @xmath5 line .      to plot real galaxies in figure 1 , we compile all morphological types of galaxies except for elliptical galaxies from the literature . in figure 1 , the filled circles are early type spiral ( sa  sab ) galaxies observed by @xcite , who selected active star - forming early type spiral galaxies with @xmath92 .",
    "the filled squares , open squares , and crosses are early type spiral ( s0sbc ) , late type spiral ( sc  sm ) , and irregular ( including peculiar and merger ) galaxies , respectively , observed by @xcite , who selected galaxies covering all morphological types .",
    "the filled triangles , open triangles , and stars are also early spiral , late spiral , and irregular ( also peculiar and merger ) galaxies , respectively , observed by @xcite , who selected active star - forming galaxies observed by @xmath93 satellite .",
    "any galaxies containing an agn are excluded .",
    "we find that almost all ( 43/52 ) galaxies fall in the applicable area. for 7 out of 9 galaxies in the outside of the applicable area , we fail to determine @xmath58 because they become negative values .",
    "although the uncertainties of the determined @xmath58 and @xmath20 are large and compiled galaxies do not make a complete sample , this result indicate that many nearby normal galaxies are really in the applicable area.    we emphasize the following two points .",
    "first , it is a just coincidence that k98 ir formula is applicable to normal galaxies .",
    "it results from offsetting two effects of a small dust opacity and a large cirrus contribution of normal galaxies relative to starburst galaxies on the conversion coefficient of k98 ir formula ( kennicutt 1998b , ihk00 ) . for an example case of a galaxy with @xmath94 and @xmath95  , while only about 70% luminosity of the sf population is converted into the ir luminosity , it is almost the same amount as the rest 30% sf luminosity that is supplied with the ir luminosity by the underlying population .",
    "second , the result above is robust for changing the adopted parameter sets of the dust extinction .",
    "one might think that our result depends on the dust extinction law adopted .",
    "however , we note that it dose not change when we change the parameters in the range of @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 as shown in figure 2 ( an extra figure ) .",
    "this point will be discussed in detail in the forthcoming paper ( inoue 2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "we discuss the condition required to fall in the applicable area. from the lower bound of @xmath20 in figure 1 ( @xmath99 ) , we find that a quiescent galaxy with a large dust amount ( a small @xmath20 and a large @xmath58 ) is in the outside of the applicable area. since galaxies showing a lower activity of the star formation tend to be more transparent @xcite , the number of galaxies falling in the area of large @xmath58 and small @xmath20 may be small . moreover , we find that the lower bound of @xmath20 is @xmath100 for a galaxy with @xmath101 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath102  .",
    "this boundary can be exceeded not only by active star - forming galaxies but also by many nearby normal spiral and irregular galaxies @xcite .",
    "the upper bound of @xmath20 in figure 1 ( @xmath60 ) reaches unity if @xmath58 is larger than about 0.1 .",
    "thus , a starburst galaxy having very small dust content of @xmath103 is in the outside of the applicable area. for example , i zw 18 , which is an active star - forming and the most metal deficient nearby dwarf galaxies , has typically @xmath104 mag in the southeast h ii region @xcite .",
    "it corresponds to @xmath105 if we adopt @xmath32 . by taking into account @xmath24",
    "estimated from very large @xmath106   @xcite , i zw 18 is in the outside of the applicable area.    in conclusion , we find that the range of a dust opacity and a star - forming activity to be @xmath59 is very large .",
    "furthermore , we confirm that these parameters of many nearby normal and active star - forming galaxies really fall in this range .",
    "therefore , we can apply k98 ir formula assuming @xmath107 to many nearby normal galaxies as well as dusty starbursts without any correction factor within a factor of 2 uncertainty .",
    "however , we can not apply it to dust rich but quiescent galaxies and extremely dust poor galaxies .",
    "therefore , we need to divide the coefficient of k98 ir formula by a correction factor , @xmath54 , when we apply it to such galaxies .",
    "following the model in this letter , we can estimate the correction factor for any galaxies if we have all data required , although we must more refine the model .",
    "the author would like to thank h. kamaya , t. t. takeuchi , and h. hirashita for their suggestions to improve the quality of this work , and also , to thank an anonymous referee for his / her many helpful comments to this paper .",
    "the author has made extensive use of nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service ( ads ) ."
