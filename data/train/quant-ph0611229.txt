    "entanglement is an essential ingredient in many applications of quantum information theory such as dense coding , teleportation , quantum cryptography and quantum computing @xcite",
    ". therefore , the characterization and quantification of entanglement are of great importance in this field . however , and despite many efforts in the last decade , a completely satisfactory solution to both problems has not been found . attending to the first one ( the so - called separability problem ) , there exist , nevertheless , several sufficient conditions for the detection of entanglement .",
    "the most powerful is known as the peres - horodecki or positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion @xcite , which is also necessary for low - dimensional systems ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "another remarkable sufficient condition is given by the computable cross norm @xcite or realignment @xcite ( ccnr ) criterion , which allows to detect many entangled states for which the ppt criterion fails .",
    "recently , another criterion with this property @xcite has been developed by the author which we shall denote as correlation matrix ( cm ) criterion .",
    "there are also other important criteria , which , however , lack the operational character of the aforementioned ones , since they are stated in terms of mean values or variances of observables which have to be chosen wisely .",
    "this is the case of conditions based on entanglement witnesses ( ews ) @xcite or uncertainty relations @xcite . in what comes to the quantification of entanglement",
    ", there exist a large variety of proposed measures @xcite .",
    "however , the explicit computation of these measures for arbitrary states is a very hard task , not only analytically but also from the computational point of view since they require optimization over a large number of parameters . , which relies on the peres - horodecki criterion and therefore fails to quantify the entanglement of ppt entangled states .",
    "] the only measures for which an analytical expression is available is the entanglement of formation @xcite and the concurrence @xcite , for which wootters @xcite derived a formula in the case of two qubits . given the aforementioned difficulties for the evaluation of the concurrence for higher dimensions , good bounds for the estimation of this quantity have been sought . while , by construction , upper bounds are numerically affordable , the derivation of lower bounds has demanded a more thorough analysis @xcite .",
    "a completely analytical and powerful lower bound for the concurrence was found in @xcite by relating this quantity with the ppt and ccnr criteria , giving shape , therefore , to the intuitive idea that a stronger violation of a separability condition may indicate a higher amount of entanglement .",
    "in fact , a possible connection between the value of concurrence and the violation of a separability condition based on local uncertainty relations ( lurs ) was already suggested in @xcite ( see @xcite for further discussions on lurs and the quantification of entanglement ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to sharpen the bounds of @xcite by relating concurrence and the lurs and cm criteria , giving as a by - product a deeper insight in the above idea .",
    "partial improvements on these bounds have already been achieved in the particular case of @xmath2 quantum systems with even @xmath3 in @xcite by considering an ew based separability criterion @xcite , but the approach here is valid for the general case .",
    "the bounds imposed by measurements of arbitrary ews on different entanglement measures have been recently studied in @xcite .",
    "we start by recalling the definitions of the concepts and quantities we are dealing with .",
    "let @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the hilbert spaces of subsystems @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "then , the quantum state of the total system is characterized by the density operator @xmath9 , where @xmath10 stands for the real vector space of hermitian operators acting on @xmath11 , which is a hilbert - schmidt space ( with inner product @xmath12 ) .",
    "the state is said to be separable ( entangled ) if it can ( can not ) be written as a convex combination of product states @xcite , i. e. @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) denotes a pure state density matrix acting on @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the generalized definition @xcite for the concurrence of a pure state @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 , where the reduced density matrix @xmath22 is obtained by tracing out subsystem @xmath7 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath24 , the lower bound being attained by product states and the upper bound by maximally entangled states .",
    "the definition is extended to general mixed states @xmath25 by the convex roof , @xmath26 consequently , @xmath27 if , and only if , @xmath25 is a separable state .",
    "the ppt and ccnr criteria can be formulated in several ways . basically",
    ", they state that certain rearrangements of the matrix elements of @xmath25 @xcite , namely , the partial transpose @xmath28 ( ppt criterion ) and the realignment @xmath29 ( ccnr criterion ) , are such that for separable states @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where here , and throughout the paper , @xmath32 stands for the trace norm ( i.e. the sum of the singular values ) . by directly relating both criteria and concurrence by means of the schmidt coefficients of a pure state",
    "it was found in @xcite that @xmath33.\\ ] ]      one of the most interesting separability criteria based on uncertainty relations is that of lurs @xcite , since it can detect ppt entanglement @xcite .",
    "it states that if @xmath34 and @xmath35 are observables acting on @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , fulfilling uncertainty relations @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , then , @xmath39 holds for separable states @xcite . the variance @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the expectation value of the observable @xmath43 .",
    "a particularly interesting choice for the observables is that of local orthogonal observables ( loos ) @xcite , that is , orthonormal bases of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which we shall denote @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in this case",
    "( [ lur ] ) reads @xcite @xmath48 since @xmath49 notice that if @xmath50 , in eq .",
    "( [ lurloos ] ) ( and throughout the paper ) it is understood that @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "the standard set of loos is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 and similarly for @xmath55 .",
    "the importance of the lurs condition formulated in terms of loos relies on that it is strictly stronger than the ccnr condition @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it can detect entangled states for which both the ppt and ccnr criteria fail @xcite . in order to relate concurrence and lurs with loos analogously as in eq .",
    "( [ caf ] ) we start with the following lemma :    for any set of loos @xmath56 and @xmath55 and any @xmath57 ( @xmath8 ) pure state @xmath20 with schmidt decomposition @xmath58 , @xmath59 holds .",
    "the bound is attained when @xmath53 and @xmath60 ( constructed from the corresponding schmidt basis ) .",
    "_ we have that @xmath61 where @xmath62 let us write @xmath63 , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "notice that @xmath66 is a separable state and that its reductions are the same as those of @xmath67 ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath70 now , since lurs hold for separable states we have that @xmath71 and then , @xmath72 so that it remains to prove that @xmath73 . to do so , notice that @xmath74 where in the last step we have used that @xmath75",
    ". now , the result follows because @xmath76 @xmath77 for any set of loos @xmath56 and @xmath55 . to see this , consider that @xmath44 is isomorphic to @xmath78 with the standard inner product , so that the @xmath56 can be arranged as column vectors which give an orthonormal basis of this space .",
    "this column vectors together give rise to a unitary matrix @xmath79 , and @xmath80 corresponds to summing the squared modulus of the elements of a certain row of @xmath79 and , therefore , it equals unity .",
    "obviously the same reasoning holds for @xmath81 .",
    "it remains to check that the bound is attained by the above stated set of loos . using that @xmath82 and @xmath83 @xcite , it is straightforward to find that @xmath84 considering that any pure density matrix @xmath67 achieves its schmidt decomposition for the standard loos , i.e. @xmath85 , it follows that @xmath86 and that @xmath87 @xmath88 for the set of loos mentioned in the statement of the lemma , and the result is thus proved",
    ".    now , we can prove our main result .",
    "for any @xmath57 ( @xmath8 ) quantum state @xmath25 , @xmath89 holds for any set of loos @xmath56 and @xmath55 .",
    "_ let @xmath90 be the decomposition of @xmath25 for which the minimum in eq.([concurrence ] ) is attained , so that , @xmath91 .",
    "since the concurrence of a pure state is directly related to its schmidt coefficients @xcite : @xmath92 , and @xcite @xmath93 we have that @xmath94 .",
    "now , the use of lemma 1 and the fact that @xmath95 for any observable @xmath43 ( see e.g. @xcite ) proves the desired result .",
    "next we present a couple of examples which illustrate how this result can improve on the bounds of @xcite .",
    "first , consider the case of ppt entangled states . in this case any non - trivial bound on concurrence given by eq .",
    "( [ caf ] ) must rely on the ccnr criterion .",
    "however , the lurs criterion can identify states of this kind which are not detected by the ccnr criterion and , therefore , place a non - trivial bound on concurrence where the previous approach failed ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , eq .  ( [ t1 ] ) can improve the estimation of ppt entanglement of eq .",
    "( [ caf ] ) even when the latter supplies a non - trivial bound .",
    "for instance , consider the following @xmath96 ppt entangled state constructed in @xcite from unextendible product bases ( upb ) : @xmath97 , where @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . while eq .",
    "( [ caf ] ) yields @xmath103 @xcite , theorem 1 with the loos used in @xcite to improve the detection of @xmath25 mixed with white noise gives @xmath104 .",
    "another interesting example is to consider the @xmath1 state @xmath105 , where @xmath106 , which shows that ( [ t1 ] ) can give a better bound for the concurrence than ( [ caf ] ) even though the ppt criterion characterizes entanglement optimally in this case ( see fig .",
    "solid line : bound given by the lurs criterion with the loos that achieve the bound in eq .",
    "( [ lema ] ) for the state @xmath107 .",
    "dotted line : bound given by the ppt criterion . dashed line : bound given by the ccnr criterion .",
    "( the last two bounds overlap ) . ]      besides its ppt entanglement detection capability , the cm criterion can be stronger than the ccnr criterion when @xmath108 @xcite , so it seems worthwhile to derive an analogous result relying on this criterion .",
    "it is based on the bloch representation of density matrices which is achieved by expanding @xmath25 with respect to a particular set of unnormalized loos , namely , the identity and the traceless hermitian generators of @xmath109 and @xmath110 ( denoted @xmath111 and @xmath112 hereafter ) , i.e. @xmath113 . the generators @xmath114 of @xmath109 can be constructed from any orthonormal basis in @xmath18 @xcite , @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "the bloch representation has two kind of parameters : @xmath118 and @xmath119 , which are local since they are the bloch parameters of the reductions ( @xmath120 , @xmath121 ) ; and @xmath122 , which are responsible for the possible correlations between the subsystems .",
    "these last coefficients can be arranged to form the cm , @xmath123 .",
    "the cm criterion affirms that there is an upper bound to the correlations inherent in a separable state since @xmath124 must hold for these states @xcite .    for any @xmath57 ( @xmath8 ) quantum state @xmath25",
    ", @xmath125 holds .",
    "_ as before , let us first relate @xmath126 of a pure state to its schmidt coefficients .",
    "following the notation of the proof of lemma 1 we write the pure state density matrix as @xmath127 .",
    "since @xmath66 is diagonal , its bloch representation is just given in terms of the identity and the @xmath128 s .",
    "therefore , the cm of @xmath67 is block - diagonal and , thus , @xmath129 .",
    "hence , using again eq.([desigualdad ] ) we have that @xmath130 let @xmath90 denote the ensemble decomposition of @xmath25 for which @xmath91 .",
    "then , we can use the above inequality for every @xmath131 together with the triangle inequality ( @xmath132 ) to prove the claim .    regrettably , to find examples in which eq .",
    "( [ t2 ] ) improves the bound given by eq .",
    "( [ caf ] ) is harder than in the case of lurs .",
    "this is , among other reasons , because the norm of the cm of a pure state is related to the schmidt coefficients through an inequality , while in the ppt and ccnr cases this kind of relation was given by equality .",
    "thus , theorem 2 is only expected to improve on the result of @xcite for states which are detected by the cm criterion but not by the ppt and ccnr criteria , or , more generally , in situations where the former criterion is stronger than both the later criteria at the same time @xcite .",
    "we have derived an analytical lower bound for the concurrence related to the lurs criterion for separability .",
    "we have shown by considering explicit examples how this result can improve the bounds given in @xcite , which rely on the ppt and ccnr criteria .",
    "we have also shown that this new result can yield better bounds for the estimation of concurrence even in situations where the ppt criterion is optimal for the detection of entanglement .",
    "however , eq.([t1 ] ) should not be considered to render eq .",
    "( [ caf ] ) obsolete but rather as a complement of it that can be used to refine the bounds that ( [ caf ] ) provides when a suitable choice of loos is made . to determine what set of loos yields the best bound for a given state is left as an interesting open problem .",
    "we also think that this result helps to understand the relation between entanglement quantification and the lurs criterion . like the results of @xcite",
    "our bound can be attained by states having a particular optimal ensemble decomposition .",
    "this is the case of isotropic states @xcite when @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the chosen loos , and , hence , this explains the coincidence of concurrence and violation of lurs pointed out in @xcite .",
    "we have also provided a similar lower bound on concurrence in terms of violations of the cm criterion for separability .",
    "although this result is not as powerful as the one based on lurs , since it only seems to yield better bounds than what can be obtained using eq.([caf ] ) in situations where the cm criterion has a stronger entanglement detection capability than both the ppt and ccnr criteria jointly , it provides a rigorous relation between concurrence and a correlation - based local unitary invariant measure , which is convenient from the experimental point of view as discussed in @xcite .",
    "finally , let us mention that the results presented here can be extended straightforwardly to yield lower bounds for the entanglement of formation by using the ideas of @xcite .",
