    "<S> in this paper , we propose an iterative interference alignment ( ia ) algorithm for mimo cellular networks with _ partial connectivity _ , which is induced by heterogeneous path losses and spatial correlation . </S>",
    "<S> such systems impose several key technical challenges in the ia algorithm design , namely the _ overlapping between the direct and interfering links _ due to the mimo cellular topology as well as how to exploit the _ </S>",
    "<S> partial connectivity_. we shall address these challenges and propose a three stage ia algorithm . as illustration </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the achievable degree of freedom ( dof ) of the proposed algorithm for a symmetric partially connected mimo cellular network . </S>",
    "<S> we show that there is significant dof gain compared with conventional ia algorithms due to partial connectivity . </S>",
    "<S> the derived dof bound is also backward compatible with that achieved on fully connected k - pair mimo interference channels .    </S>",
