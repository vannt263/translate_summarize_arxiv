    "it has been demonstrated by the dark matter searching experiment drift  @xcite using time projection chambers ( tpc ) filled with low pressure cs@xmath0 that the direction of few mm long nuclear recoil tracks can be measured .",
    "however , due to the limited spatial resolution of the readout and ionization charge diffusion in the large detector volume , its distribution along the low energy nuclear recoil track is difficult to reconstruct .    in this work preliminary results of simulations of the energy loss and ionization charge distribution along tracks of carbon and sulfur ions in 40 torr cs@xmath0 ( @xmath1=1.67@xmath210@xmath3 g/@xmath4 )",
    "are presented . the so - called head - tail effect ,",
    "describing the location of the majority of the ioinisation charge either at the beginning ( tail ) or at the end ( head ) of the track as a function of ion energy and diffusion has been studied .",
    "srim  @xcite and trim programs were used to calculate stopping powers for ions in gases , to investigate with monte carlo generators the energy loss and ionization charge distribution along the ion track on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the stopping and range of ions in matter ( srim ) simulation program calculates as a function of energy : the electronic ( @xmath5 ) and nuclear ( @xmath6 ) energy loss , range and longitudinal and lateral straggling of ions moving in matter .",
    "they have been calculated here for ion energies up to 500 kev . to understand the behaviour along the tracks they are plotted in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] and fig .",
    "[ f2 ] against ion range , the ion energies marked here on the plot at 50 kev intervals .",
    "as can be seen at higher energies the electronic energy loss is dominant and decreases with energy where at lower values the nuclear energy loss becomes greater than the electronic .",
    "for example for sulfur ions the nuclear energy loss starts to dominate already at an energy of 100 kev .",
    "this means that energy loss along the ion track is not continuously decreasing .",
    "this has an impact on the density of the ionization charge along the track and makes the head - tail effect energy dependent .    in the nuclear interactions secondary",
    "nuclear recoils are created .",
    "although 3 - 4 times higher energy is needed to create an electron - ion pair by nuclear recoils than by electrons , they are a source of ionization .    due to continuous collisions with gas atoms",
    "the direction of the moving ions become deviated from the original path .",
    "this causes fluctuations in the ion s range , described by the lateral and longitudinal straggling and depending on ion energy ( see fig  [ f2 ] ) .",
    "one can see that ions slowing down experience increasing straggling relative to the drift length they have ahead , which rises sharply at the very end of the track .",
    "tables calculated by srim are used in the monte carlo generator program called trim .",
    "in addition to on - line histogramming of various quantities , trim results are also recorded event by event in two different formats .",
    "the first is included in the file called _",
    "collison.txt _ generated either in quick simulation , where for every ion collision its current energy , position in 3d and type of secondary recoils with their initial energy is recorded , or in full nuclear recoil cascade simulation , where information about the energies and positions of all created nuclear recoils is added .",
    "trim creates also an output file called _ exyz _ which , though with superior spatial resolution to the other outputs , delivers information only about ion energy loss along the track .",
    "the latter format has been chosen here for the head - tail effect analysis .",
    "for each ion with a given energy 10@xmath7 events were recorded and further analysed .",
    "the energies used were for sulfur : from 10 to 100 with a step of 10 kev then up to 250 with a step of 25 kev and up to 400 with a step of 50 kev and carbon from 10 to 100 with a step of 10 kev then up to 200 kev with a step of 25 kev and up to 300 with a step of 50 kev .",
    "each event in the trim output _",
    "file contained on average 100 collision points with information about : current ion energy , the 3d coordinate of the collision point and energy loss , for which the sum equals the initial energy of the ion .",
    "for carbon and sulfur ions the number of ionization charges was calculated using w - values taken from  @xcite . for each ion ,",
    "a w - value was used at every collision according to its current energy .",
    "note that the actual value of w at energy below 20 kev is not well known and values used here are based on an extrapolation of the function obtained from the polynomial fit to the existing data .    based on this approximation the head - tail effect has been studied for three different configurations of ion interaction points : along the track , projected onto the line between the beginning and the end of the track and projected onto the axis of the initial ion direction .",
    "because of the range straggling of ions with the same energy , the position of each interaction projected point has been normalised to the projected range of the ion .      using coordinates of the first and the last point of the ion track",
    "its projected range has been calculated .",
    "[ f5 ] shows results for sulfur and carbon ions in cs@xmath0 in comparison with data from  @xcite .",
    "there is very good agreement for sulfur but a large discrepancy for carbon ions for which results from this paper are more than twice smaller than in  @xcite .    in the conversion of the energy loss into ionization charge ,",
    "the number of electrons attached with no loss to cs@xmath0 molecules , creating cs@xmath8 and called negative ions pairs ( nips ) , was summed for each carbon and sulfur ion energy .",
    "[ f6 ] shows , as a function of nips , the range of nuclear recoils together with the range of alpha particles and electrons calculated with trim and estar  @xcite , respectively .",
    "[ tab1 ]    the nip values were calculated using w - value=19 ev . as one can see the range of electrons with the same number of nips as nuclear recoils is one order of magnitude greater than the range of recoils .",
    "this demonstrates that a tpc operating with 40 torr cs@xmath0 has great separation power between electron and nuclear recoils .",
    "however , it shows also that the range of nuclear recoils and alpha particles are close to each other , with a difference not greater than 1 - 2 mm for tracks a few mm long , often also elongated due to the charge thermal diffusion .    to check the consistency of the srim results with existing measurements , the range of 103 kev @xmath9pb recoils in several pure and binary gases at stp was calculated and compared with results from  @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab1 ] indicating in most cases less than a 10% difference .",
    "similar differences between measurements and simulation were observed for 5 - 6 mev alpha particles from rn and po decays in 40 torr cs@xmath0  @xcite .      along with the event - by - event information on ion energy loss",
    ", trim also delivers histograms accumulated on - line and showing distributions of average values of several quantities as a function of target depth . with default initial trim settings the target depth corresponds to projection onto the axis of the initial direction of ion motion .",
    "one of the histograms shows distributions of the average ionization energy loss by ion and secondary recoils .",
    "an example of such a distribution , for 1000 sulfur ions with energy of 100 kev , is shown in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] .",
    "one can see ionization energy loss by ion , secondary recoils and by the sum of them .",
    "the latter is compared with scaled results from the _ exyz _ trim output file analysis .",
    "both show the same character of the ionization energy loss along the target depth indicating here that more energy is lost at the beginning of the track ( tail ) than at the end ( head ) .",
    "however , this distribution is along the target depth regardless of the ion range which , due to straggling , varies from ion to ion .",
    "this is likely not the case in an actual experiment where recoils are detected on an event - by - event basis and charge distribution along the track is measured with respect to its projected range .",
    "thus for this work we study the energy loss and head - tail effect also using the _ exyz _ output file .    for sulfur and carbon ions the distributions of ionization charge were studied along : the track , projection onto a line between the first and last point of the track , and projection onto the axis of the initial ion motion .",
    "the latter were studied with and without diffusion .",
    "diffused nips were redistributed in space according to the thermal diffusion formula : @xmath10 where : @xmath11 is boltzmann constant , _",
    "t _ ambient temperature , _ e _ electron charge , _ e _ drift electric field and _ l _ drift distance .",
    "after numerical simplifications a diffusion formula was used of form : @xmath12=0.72\\sqrt{\\frac{l[m]}{e[kv / cm]}}$ ] for three different drift lengths _ l _ : 0.1 , 0.3 and 0.5 m and electric field in the drift iib detector _ e_= 0.58 kv / cm .",
    "figs.[[f10 ] ] and [ [ f11 ] ] show nip distributions along the sulfur and carbon tracks , respectively . for both ,",
    "as expected , the ionization charge distributions along the line following the ion s motion ( a ) are not featured with a sharp rise at the end caused by the straggling .",
    "the negative slope of the distributions is very clear down to 40 kev and 20 kev for s and c , respectively from which at lower energies ( where nuclear energy loss dominates ) they become flat .",
    "intermediate distributions of the charge projected onto a line between the track start and end point were studied .",
    "as one can see in ( b ) these still have negative slope but the sharp rise at the end is now clearly visible .",
    "the shape of distributions with projection onto the axis of the initial direction of motion is shown in ( c ) . for sulfur",
    "this is almost flat with a very sharp rise at the end , while for carbon it remains with negative slope .",
    "an example of the impact of the diffusion caused by 0.5 m long drift , the maximum likely in drift ii , can be seen in figs .",
    "[ f10]d and  [ f11]d .    for diffused distributions",
    "the head - tail effect was studied by calculation of the mean position of the distribution as a function of ion energy and drift length .",
    "[ f12 ] shows the position of the mean along carbon and sulfur ion tracks with the head - tail effect dependent mainly on the ion energy .",
    "points above 50% are for ion tracks with greater  head ",
    "than  tail  and those below for ions with the reversed effect .",
    "in this work preliminary results of the head - tail effect of carbon and sulfur ions in low pressure cs@xmath13 gas used in drift detectors have been presented .",
    "results were obtained using srim and trim simulation packages together with w - values available from existing data above ion energies of 20 kev . for lower ion energies w - values",
    "have been extrapolated using a polynomial fit to the existing data ranging from 20 to 300 kev .",
    "results indicate the existence of the head - tail effect resulting respectively for carbon and sulfur greater head for energies below 70 and 350 kev , above which tail starts to dominate . as shown head - tail effect depends on the w - value which below 20 kev may be greater than values used in this work .",
    "this could impact significantly on the number of ionisation charge at the head of the track and could cause the tail to become dominant at lower energy ."
