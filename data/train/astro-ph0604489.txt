    "the nasa mission `` deep impact '' encountered comet 9p / tempel 1 around 05:44 ut on 2005 july 4 , with the high velocity collision of the impactor with the comet . the impactor had mass 370 kg and hit with a relative velocity of 10.2 km / s , so it was expected to excavate a hole to the depth of several tens of metres , and around 100 m in diameter .",
    "there was a coordinated international campaign of ground - based and satellite observations ( meech et al .",
    "2005a , 2005b ) to observe the impact event , to complement the observations from the flyby part of the deep impact mission , and to follow changes in the comet as new activity developed after the impact .",
    "comets are often described as `` the most pristine material in the solar system '' but the material we observe from the gas and dust in the coma has been chemically and physically processed by both solar heating and radiation .",
    "even the surface of the nucleus has been modified from the original , presumably amorphous ( bar - nun & laufer 2003 ) , ices .",
    "the dust and volatiles ( similar to the icy grains in the ism ) are processed to a surface crust , concurrent with the loss of volatiles , crystallisation and the formation of a dust mantle .",
    "one of the major aims of the deep impact mission was to study the ` pristine ' material below the surface by exposing it in the crater formed by the impactor .",
    "the major chemical constituents of comets are h@xmath7o ( which dissociates to oh ) , co@xmath7 , co and ch@xmath5oh ( methanol ) .",
    "other important minor constituents , that can be observed at millimetre / submillimetre wavelengths are h@xmath7co ( formaldehyde ) , cs , h@xmath7s , hcn , hnc and ch@xmath5cn .",
    "the relative abundances are found to vary considerably between different comets ( biver et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "comet 9p / tempel 1 is a typical jupiter - family periodic comet , chosen largely for its favourable orbit for the spacecraft encounter ( ahearn et al .",
    "2005a ) . at encounter",
    ", it was close to perihelion , with heliocentric distance 1.51 au and geocentric distance 0.89 au .",
    "the expected water release was @xmath8 molecules / second , before the effect of the impact ( lisse et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the spacecraft impact was a `` successful '' experiment releasing more than @xmath9 kg of dust ( meech et al .",
    "2005b ) , leading to changes monitored by the flyby spacecraft ( ahearn et al .",
    "2005b ) and the international campaign ( meech et al .",
    "2005b ) over a wide range of wavelengths and techniques .",
    "the timing of the impact / flyby was chosen to allow simultaneous ( redundant ) nasa deep space network ( dsn ) ground - station coverage from goldstone ( california ) and tidbinbilla ( australia ) .",
    "for the radio part of the international campaign , this meant australia was geographically well - placed to monitor changes in the first few hours after impact on july 4 .",
    "we made radio observations with the parkes 64-m telescope to monitor oh , the mopra 22-m telescope to monitor hcn ( and cs ) and the australia telescope compact array to detect any small - scale hcn , 3-mm continuum or 6.7 ghz ch@xmath5oh maser .",
    "parkes observations were made of the 1667.3590 and 1665.4018 mhz oh lines simultaneously , with frequency switching of the 8 mhz bandwidth between centre 1665.9 and 1666.9 mhz .",
    "the observations were made on 3 days , july 4 , 5 and 6 , with the on - source ut times and total integration time as given in table [ pks_results ] .",
    "we used frequency switching ( 10 second period ) rather than position switching for bandpass calibration , to maximise the on - source integration time .",
    "we used a correlator configuration with 8192 channels , giving 0.95 khz or 0.176 km / s channels .",
    "the halfpower beamwidth at 1.66 ghz was 14 arcmin .",
    "the comet was tracked using the proper motion from the ephemeris , updated every hour or so .",
    "the observing setup was checked by observations of the oh maser lines in evolved stars vy cma , v ant , r crt and w hya .",
    "the data were reduced with the atnf spc package + ( http://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/spc.html ) which handles the rpfits format output of the atnf correlators , and allowed flexible , albeit labour intensive , processing of the buffers for the non - standard frequency - switched observations . the raw spectra had four quadrants , with spectra centred at both 1665.9 and 1666.9 mhz and two circular polarisations of the h - oh receiver .",
    "the bandpass correction was made by using the 1665.9 mhz data as signal , and the 1666.9 mhz data as reference in the signal - reference quotient , and the two polarisations were averaged .",
    "the data were folded ( copied , shifted by the 1 mhz frequency shift , inverted and averaged ) to combine the frequency shifted spectra .",
    "there were not regular standing waves in the spectra , but the baselines were still not very flat after the frequency switching calibration .",
    "the residual bandpass baseline was removed with a fifth - order polynomial .",
    "separate spectra were extracted for the 1667.3590 and 1665.4018 mhz transitions , for each day of observation , corrected for different rest frequencies onto a geocentric velocity scale .",

    "mopra observations were made of the 88.63 ghz hcn @xmath10 ( hyperfine triplet 88630.4157 , 88631.8473 and 88633.936 mhz ) and 97.98095 ghz cs @xmath11 lines , as given in table [ mop_results ] on five days , july 2  6 .",
    "we used a correlator configuration with two linear polarisations each 32 mhz bandwidth and 1024 channels , giving 31 khz or 0.106 km / s channels for hcn and 0.096 km / s for cs .",
    "position switching mode was used to get good bandpass baseline .",
    "the halfpower beamwidth was 35 arcsec , and the comet was tracked using the positions from the jpl horizons ephemeris .",
    "pointing was checked with sio masers after retuning the second polarisation .",
    "the pointing rms was around 9 arcsec , so this dominated over any residual errors in the ephemeris tracking .",
    "the combination of on - off switching , and pointing checks , meant that the on - source integration time was somewhat less than 50 percent of the observing time eg .",
    "3.1 hours on july 4 .",
    "the weather on july 2  4 was good for 3-mm observing , as shown by the @xmath12 in table [ mop_results ] , with the before impact july 4 data at low elevation , but deteriorated on july 5 and 6 giving higher @xmath12 .",
    "the data were also reduced with the atnf spc package , with the dfm ( data from mopra ) script + ( http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/astro/mopra/software.php ) used to automate the on - off position switching quotients and polarisation averaging .",
    "the spectra were combined for each day in geocentric velocity and also shifted onto the velocity scale of the comet , for fitting and combining different days .",
    "australia telescope compact array ( atca ) observations of the hcn @xmath10 line were made on july 4 , using the h75 array .",
    "this array provided two - dimensional _ u , v _ - coverage for the observations near the equator , and short baselines . the array at 3-mm uses five ( of the six ) 22-m telescopes , with primary beam 35 arcsec .",
    "the correlator configuration was full_16_256 - 64 with the first if having 16 mhz bandwidth and 256 channels each 62.5 khz or 0.21 km / s and the second if 64 mhz bandwidth and 64 channels for calibration and continuum observations .",
    "the phase and pointing centres were tracked using an ephemeris file generated from the jpl horizons ephemeris .",
    "the strong 3-mm sources 0537 - 441 and 1253 - 055 ( 3c279 ) were used as setup sources and primary calibrators .",
    "the secondary , phase calibrator was 1334 - 127 .",
    "the pointing was updated using 1334 - 127 every hour or so , and the system temperature measured every half hour .",
    "the observations were reduced with the miriad package ( sault , teuben & wright 1995 ; http://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/miriad/ ) including the specific routines for 3-mm atca observations , such as corrections for system temperature , gain as a function of elevation and antenna position errors .",
    "the primary flux calibration used sources 0537 - 441 , 1253 - 055 and 1830 - 211 and flux values from atca monitoring of strong , albeit , variable calibrators relative to the flux of the planets .",
    "we did not observe planetary flux calibrators during our run , as the planets were either resolved or not in the accessible right ascension range .",

    "6 of atca , which is not equipped with the 3-mm receiver , was used to observe the @xmath15  a@xmath16 methanol ( ch@xmath5oh ) transition at 6668.5128 mhz simultaneously with the hcn 1 - 0 observations by the rest of the array on july 4 .",
    "the broad band signal was fed into the long baseline array data acquisition system ( lba das ) configured to digitize 4  mhz of bandwidth .",
    "this digital signal was recorded on a computer hard disk using the capture card manufactured by the metshovi radio observatory ( the vsib card ) .",
    "the autocorrelation spectra were calculated off - line for each 10 seconds interval using the software supplied with the capture card .",
    "the mode used in software correlation split the 4  mhz bandwidth selected by das into 1024 spectral channels , providing a 0.18  km  s@xmath17 spectral resolution .",
    "two orthogonal linear polarizations were recorded separately and averaged during the data processing .",
    "the pointing centre was updated once per hour ( at 30 minutes of each ut hour ) using the jpl horizons ephemeris . at the given frequency",
    "the full width at half maximum of the beam was 7.2 arcmin .",
    "although the antenna constantly tracked the comet , the hardware stopped recording periodically for a short period of time ( probably to flush the buffers ) .",
    "this resulted in 10@xmath1830% loss of integration time .",
    "the data processing was done using our own software .",
    "it included a weighted averaging to form 5 minute scans of data , a high - order polynomial baselining of each polarization for each scan , followed by the weighted averaging of individual polarizations and scans .",
    "because the noise diode was not used in this non - standard setup , the rms in the spectrum was used as a measure of t@xmath19 to calculate the weights of individual spectra for averaging .",
    "these weights appeared to stay almost the same ( difference less than 0.1% ) througout the observations with the constant factor of about 1.8 between different polarizations .",
    "the flux scale was established by observing a test maser source g9.62 - 0.20e .",
    "this source exhibits periodic flares , with the date of our observations falling into a quiescent stage characterized by the flux density about 4700  jy ( goedhart et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute flux density scale is determined by the `` light curve '' of goedhart et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and is about 10% . the radial velocity of this maser allowed it to be observed in the same 4  mhz band with the same setup of the conversion chain ( local oscillators ) , as was used for the comet .",
    "therefore , the maser was observed a few times to check the system and to test the conversion chain setup , which determines the relation between the spectral channels and frequencies .",
    "the parkes oh spectra were averaged over each of the three days of observations , and combined for the three days .",

    "the results presented here will be most useful when combined with other complementary data into physical models .",
    "these data include ( but are not restricted to ) other 18-cm oh observations , from the green bank telescope ( gbt ) and nanay , and millimetre hcn , cs and ch@xmath5oh observations from the iram-30 m , cso-10 m and jcmt , including higher transitions . in the steady state , the models typically assume constant velocity outflow from the nucleus ( which would give radial dependence of density @xmath22 and column density integrated along the line of sight @xmath23 ) , modified by the time - dependent formation and destruction of the species of interest .    for lines such as hcn 1 - 0 the conversion between integrated line intensity and column density ( and production rate )",
    "is relatively straight - forward , using standard radiative transfer equations ( e.g. crovisier et al .",
    "1987 ) , but for the 18-cm oh lines there is additional complexity ( e.g. crovisier et al . 2002 ) with uv - pumping dependent on the heliocentric velocity , leading to inversion or anti - inversion of the levels ( despois et al . 1981 ; schleicher & ahearn 1988 ) . taking into account the variety of maser transitions and pumping regimes observed in the interstellar medium , the case of the methanol emission is likely to be even more complex .",
    "we present here rough estimates of molecule production rates , or number of molecules , from our observations .",
    "for oh , we have used the conversion between observed line flux ( in mjy km / s ) and derived production rate ( @xmath24 in molecules / s ) from the work of crovisier et al .",
    "( 2002 ) with nanay , scaling for inversion factor , heliocentric distance , background brightness temperature and beam area .",

    "( 1981 ) model , but note that the model of schleicher & ahearn ( 1998 ) has inversion factor 0.08 , which would decrease the estimates of @xmath24 and @xmath25 by the factor 3/8 .",
    "given the discrepancies between the models at this small inversion factors ( near a zero crossing ) around heliocentric velocities near zero , the estimates of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are subject to quite a large systematic error .    from the mopra hcn flux limits , we derived the limits on hcn production rate ( @xmath26 ) in table [ mop_results ] , by scaling from the predicted flux for the iram 30-m from meech et al .",

    "the limits on the number of hcn molecules within the mopra 35 arcsec beam ( radius 11 300 km ) was calculated from the production rate , on the simple constant velocity outflow model .",
    "we similarly derived limits on hcn production rates in table [ atca_results ] from the atca hcn flux limits , and limits on the number of hcn molecules within the atca beam ( radius 1800 km ) .    note that expressed in brightness temperature , the mopra limits on hcn are much lower than the atca limits , as mopra has a much larger beam solid angle @xmath27 , and this corresponds to somewhat lower limits with mopra on the hcn production rate .",
    "however , the atca results are sensitive to the small - scale structure that might have been expected from the spacecraft impact causing an outburst . in limiting such an outburst ,",
    "the most appropriate 3 @xmath20 limit is probably @xmath28 molecules from the atca over the period 05:30 - 07:30 ut , since the compact structure would expand out of the atca beam over the period of an hour or so .",
    "similar limits on @xmath29 are obtained for the mopra and atca data averaged over the time after impact on the day jul 4 , although when averaging over these longer times material released by the impact would leave the beam area .    for the radio continuum",

    "these limits are not very restrictive .",
    "we also note that the opacity @xmath33 is not well known ; for example , altenhoff et al . ( 1999 ) argue for a value @xmath33(1 mm ) = 7.5 m@xmath31 kg@xmath17 which would decrease the dust mass limits by a factor 150 .",
