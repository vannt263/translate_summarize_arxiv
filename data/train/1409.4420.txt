    "observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal from neutral hydrogen ( ) are a very promising probe of the epoch of reionization ( eor ) , and there is a considerable observational effort underway to detect the eor 21-cm power spectrum e.g. gmrt @xcite , lofar @xcite , mwa @xcite , and paper @xcite . observing the eor 21-cm signal is one of the key scientific goals of the future telescope ska @xcite .",

    "the sensitivity of any instrument to the eor 21-cm power spectrum is constrained by the errors , a part of which arises from the system noise of the instrument and another component which is inherent to the signal that is being detected ( cosmic variance ) .",
