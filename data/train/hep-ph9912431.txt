    "<S> we evaluate the cross sections for the dissociation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 by @xmath2 and @xmath3 at low collision energies , using the quark - interchange model of barnes and swanson . the dissociation cross section for @xmath0 by @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> is found to be relatively small with a maximum of about 1 mb and a kinetic energy threshold of 0.65 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the pion - induced @xmath1 dissociation cross section is found to be much larger , with a maximum of about 5 mb and a lower threshold . </S>",
    "<S> dissociation cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath1 by @xmath3 mesons are also evaluated and are found to be large near threshold .    </S>",
    "<S> the suggestion by matsui and satz @xcite that @xmath0 production might be suppressed in a quark - gluon plasma has led to many experimental and theoretical studies of @xmath0 production in high - energy heavy - ion collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observation by na50 @xcite of anomalous @xmath0 suppression in pb+pb collisions in particular has been studied by many authors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of a @xmath0 or @xmath1 produced in a heavy - ion collision depends sensitively on charmonium dissociation cross sections , which arise from processes such as low - energy inelastic scattering of the @xmath4 state on @xmath2 or @xmath3 into open - charm final states . </S>",
    "<S> small @xmath0 dissociation cross sections by @xmath2 or @xmath3 may favor an interpretation of the pb+pb data in terms of the production of a new phase of matter , possibly the quark - gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a large @xmath3+@xmath0 dissociation cross section might imply that @xmath3+@xmath0 inelastic scattering may be an important part of the pb+pb anomaly because the density of @xmath3 mesons increases approximately quadratically as the density of pions increases . in view of the importance of these dissociation cross sections for the interpretation of heavy - ion collisions , </S>",
    "<S> they should be evaluated and incorporated in monte carlo simulations before any final conclusions are reached regarding the underlying physics .    </S>",
    "<S> the dissociation of @xmath0 by light mesons has been considered previously by several groups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the numerical cross sections quoted in these references span a considerable range , due largely to different assumptions regarding the dominant scattering mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> kharzeev , satz , and collaborators @xcite used the parton model and perturbative qcd `` short - distance '' approach of of bhanot and peskin @xcite , and found remarkably small low - energy cross sections for @xmath0 on light hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> for example , their @xmath0+@xmath5 cross section at @xmath6  gev is only about @xmath7 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a finite - mass correction increases this cross section by about a factor of two @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in high - energy heavy - ion reactions , the collisions between the produced @xmath2 and @xmath3 with @xmath0 and @xmath1 occur at low energies ( of the order of a few hundred mev to about 1 gev relative kinetic energies ) . </S>",
    "<S> the applicability of the parton model and pqcd for reactions at this low energy region is open to question .    </S>",
    "<S> matinyan and mller @xcite , haglin@xcite , and lin@xcite recently reported results for these dissociation cross sections in meson exchange models . </S>",
    "<S> they use effective meson lagrangians and assume @xmath8-channel @xmath9 and @xmath10 meson exchange , which leads to numerical results for @xmath2+@xmath0 and @xmath3+@xmath0 dissociation cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> matinyan and mller found that these cross sections are rather small ; both are @xmath11-@xmath12  mb at @xmath13  gev . including form factors ( arbitrarily chosen to be gaussian with a width set to 1.5 gev ) </S>",
    "<S> would reduce the cross section by an order of magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> haglin obtained a very different result , with much larger cross sections , by treating the @xmath10 and @xmath14 mesons as non - abelian gauge bosons in a minimally - coupled yang - mills meson lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> form factors were introduced in later calculations and the mb - scale cross sections are sensitive to the choices of the form factors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of course the use of a yang - mills lagrangian for charmed mesons has no _ a priori _ justification , so the crucial initial assumption made in these references would require independent confirmation . in any case , the assumption of @xmath8-channel exchange of a heavy meson such as a @xmath9 or @xmath10 between @xmath2 and @xmath0 with point - like couplings is difficult to justify because the range of these exchanges ( @xmath15 fm ) is much smaller than the physical sizes of the initial @xmath2 and @xmath0 mesons .    </S>",
    "<S> charmonium dissociation processes can presumably be described in terms of the fundamental quark and gluon interactions , but are of greatest phenomenological interest at energy scales in the resonance region . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , we advocate the use of the known quark - gluon forces to specify the underlying scattering amplitude , which must then be convolved with explicit nonrelativistic quark model hadron wavefunctions for the initial and final mesons .    </S>",
    "<S> martins , blaschke , and quack @xcite previously reported dissociation cross section calculations using essentially the approach we describe . </S>",
    "<S> the short - distance interaction used by these authors in particular is quite similar to the form we employ . for the confining interaction , </S>",
    "<S> however , they used a simplified color - independent gaussian potential between quark - antiquark pairs only , rather than the now well - established linear @xmath16 form . </S>",
    "<S> they found a rather large @xmath2+@xmath0 dissociation cross section which reached a maximum of about 7 mb at the kinetic energy in the center - of - mass system @xmath17 of about 0.85 gev . </S>",
    "<S> although our approach is very similar to that of martins _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> , our final numerical results differ significantly , due mainly to the modeling of the confining interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we use the approach discussed above to evaluate the dissociation cross sections of @xmath0 by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and compare our results to other theoretical cross sections reported in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also calculate cross sections for the dissociation of @xmath1 by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which have not been evaluated elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> we employ the barnes - swanson quark - interchange model @xcite to determine these dissociation amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> this approach uses the nonrelativistic quark potential model and its interquark hamiltonian to describe hadron - hadron interactions and therefore implicitly incorporates the successes of the quark model in describing the hadron spectrum and many static properties of hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> the model parameters are fixed by fits to the meson spectrum , so there is little additional freedom in determining scattering amplitudes and cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> one proceeds by calculating the scattering amplitude for a given process at born order in the interquark hamiltonian . in the case of meson - meson scattering , </S>",
    "<S> this scattering amplitude is given by the sum of the four quark line diagrams shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> these are evaluated as overlap integrals of quark model wavefunctions , using the  feynman rules \" given in app . </S>",

    "<S> this set of parameters gives masses within 0.08 gev of experiment for the @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 mesons and also provides a very good description of the @xmath18 s - wave @xmath19 phase shift . </S>",

    "<S> this second set , with a flavor - dependent @xmath32 , was used to test the sensitivity of our results to parameter variations .    before proceeding to our results , we note that the well - known  post - prior ambiguity \" arises in calculations of bound state scattering amplitudes involving rearrangement collisions @xcite . since the hamiltonian which describes the scattering process @xmath52 can be separated into free and interaction parts in two ways , @xmath53 or @xmath54 , there is an ambiguity in the choice of @xmath55 or @xmath56 as the interaction hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the first version is known as the  </S>",
    "<S> prior \" form and leads to the scattering diagrams of fig . 1 , </S>",
    "<S> in which the interactions occur before quark interchange . </S>",
    "<S> the second choice is the  post \" form , which leads to diagrams in which the interactions occur after quark interchange . </S>",
    "<S> one may show that the post and prior expressions for the scattering amplitude are equal , provided that exact eigenfunctions of the free hamiltonians are used for the asymptotic states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( the relevance of this to time reversal invariance is demonstrated numerically in ref.@xcite . ) in our calculations we employ numerically determined hamiltonian eigenfunctions for each of the external meson states considered ; in the nonrelativistic case this would suffice to eliminate the post - prior discrepancy . in the processes considered here </S>",
    "<S> we have used relativistic kinematics and phase space , but use galilean boosts for the states , as appropriate for a nonrelativistic quark model calculation . in consequence </S>",
    "<S> we find that the post and prior scattering amplitudes differ slightly . </S>",
    "<S> ( we note in passing that one could carry out a relativised version of this calculation , although the full relativistic boosts would induce small additional effects due to wigner rotations and creation of quarks and gluons . ) in this paper we use the mean of the post and prior results as our theoretical cross section , and the estimated errors due to the post - prior discrepancy and parameter variations are indicated by bands in the figures .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross sections we obtain for the dissociation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 by @xmath2 are shown in fig .  2 as a function of the kinetic energy in the center of mass system , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the rest masses of the colliding particles in the initial channel . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest - lying allowed final states are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 , and the total dissociation cross section is taken to be the sum of these three channel cross sections ; this is shown as a solid line in the figure . </S>",
    "<S> ( the reactions @xmath2+@xmath63 and @xmath2+@xmath64 are @xmath65 transitions allowed in qcd but have zero transition matrix elements in our hamiltonian ( 1 ) </S>",
    "<S> . these transition amplitudes would be nonzero for example if we included spin - orbit terms in ( 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relatively weak process @xmath2+@xmath66 has been considered in a dyson - schwinger formalism by blaschke @xmath67 @xcite , who find a maximum cross section of about 0.1  mb near threshold . </S>",

    "<S> the cross section for dissociation of the @xmath1 by @xmath2 is rather larger in part because this reaction is only weakly endothermic ; the initial @xmath2+@xmath1 kinetic energy in @xmath2+@xmath71 and @xmath72 is only about 0.05  gev at threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the total cross section reaches a maximum of about 6.2(0.8 )  mb at the kinetic energy of about 0.1  gev and has a secondary maximum of 4.6(1.8 )  mb at the kinetic energy of about @xmath73  gev due to the opening of the @xmath74 channel . </S>",

    "<S> the minimum in the cross section near the kinetic energy of 0.4 gev is due to the complete destructive interference between transfer ( t1 and t2 ) and capture ( c1 and c2 ) diagrams .    </S>",

    "<S> 4truemm    we previously noted that our @xmath2+@xmath0 cross section is considerably smaller than the estimate of ref.@xcite , although we use a similar approach . </S>",
    "<S> there are several differences between the two approaches which lead to this discrepancy . </S>",
    "<S> martins _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ assumed that the confining interaction is an attractive gaussian potential which acts only between quark - antiquark pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the neglect of the quark - quark and antiquark - antiquark confining interaction amounts to discarding the transfer diagrams ( t1 and t2 ) for the confining potential . </S>",
    "<S> since we find that the transfer and capture diagram confinement contributions are similar in magnitude but opposite in sign ( due to color factors ) , martins _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ did not include an important destructive interference . </S>",
    "<S> their use of a gaussian rather than a linear potential will obviously lead to quantitatively different cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the cross section values are quite sensitive to the parameters used when t1 and t2 are not included . </S>",
    "<S> all these factors contribute to the differences between our results and those of martin @xmath67 for @xmath2+@xmath0 collisions .    the destructive interference between transfer and capture diagrams with spin - independent forces ( color coulomb and confinement ) has been noted previously ( see , for example , refs.@xcite and references cited in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this interference explains the well - known spin - spin hyperfine dominance in light hadron scattering in channels such as @xmath18 @xmath19 and @xmath84 . in the presence of heavy quarks , however , </S>",
    "<S> most hyperfine interaction diagrams are suppressed by the large charm quark mass ; this is the reason we included the color coulomb and confining interactions in the present analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting in retrospect to examine the different channels and determine which of the various interactions dominates the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the hyperfine interaction still dominates the @xmath2+@xmath0 dissociation amplitude , whereas the linear confining interaction dominates @xmath2+@xmath1 , @xmath3+@xmath85 , and ( for the kinetic energy less than 0.3 gev ) @xmath3+@xmath1 . above @xmath12 gev , the color coulomb interaction dominates @xmath3+@xmath1 scattering . </S>",
    "<S> ( we caution the reader that this decomposition depends on the choice of the post or prior form for the t - matrix ; the results we quote are for the prior form , involving the diagrams of fig . 1 . )    </S>",
    "<S> there is no direct experimental measurement of these cross sections to which we can compare our results . </S>",
    "<S> we found a small @xmath2+@xmath0 cross section which starts at a high threshold and a large @xmath2+@xmath1 cross section which starts at a low threshold . </S>",
    "<S> if these cross sections are folded with a distribution of pions with an average kinetic energy of about 200 mev , we would obtain @xmath86 , which is consistent with earlier observation in a model of @xmath0 and @xmath1 suppression in o+a , and s+u collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hopefully , future monte carlo simulations of the dynamics of charmonium in heavy - ion collisions will lead to a more direct comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the large @xmath3+@xmath0 and @xmath3+@xmath1 cross sections we have found imply that both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 will be quickly dissociated if there is a significant @xmath3 meson population in the medium . since our results on the divergence of @xmath3+@xmath0 and @xmath3+@xmath1 dissociation </S>",
    "<S> cross sections at threshold follow directly from simple kinematics , these results must be qualitatively correct . the normalization of these cross sections , however , required detailed calculation and should also be compared to experiment if possible . since dissociations of @xmath0 by @xmath2 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 populate different states ( for example @xmath2+@xmath0 doe not lead to @xmath76 but @xmath3+@xmath0 does ) , it may be possible to separate these processes and their associated cross sections by studying the relative production of @xmath87 , @xmath88+@xmath89 and @xmath74 if the expected open charm background can be subtracted .    </S>",
    "<S> in the future it may be useful to carry out detailed simulations of @xmath0 absorption in heavy - ion collisions using the cross sections obtained here to test the accuracy of our results . if our cross sections do prove to be reasonably accurate , it will clearly be useful to incorporate them in simulations of @xmath0 suppression in pb+pb collisions and in other processes that use charmonium as a signature of the quark - gluon plasma in order to subtract the effects of @xmath0 suppression due to its interaction with hadron matter . </S>"
