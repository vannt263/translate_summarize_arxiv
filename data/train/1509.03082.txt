    "the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class @xcite is a prominent nonequilibrium class , ruling diverse kinds of nonlinear fluctuations in growing interfaces @xcite , driven particle systems @xcite , fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite , and so on . particularly noteworthy",
    "are recent analytical developments on the @xmath0-dimensional kpz class , which have exactly determined a number of its statistical properties on the solid mathematical basis @xcite .",
    "specifically , for @xmath0-dimensional kpz - class interfaces , the interface height @xmath1 , measured along the growth direction at lateral position @xmath2 and time @xmath3 , grows as @xmath4 with parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , a rescaled random variable @xmath7 , and @xmath8 being the characteristic growth exponent of the @xmath0-dimensional kpz class @xcite .",
    "then the recent analytical studies @xcite have consistently shown that @xmath9 exhibits one of the few universal distribution functions , selected by the choice of the initial condition , or equivalently the global shape of the interfaces . for example",
    ", circular interfaces grown from a point nucleus show the largest - eigenvalue distribution of random matrices in gaussian unitary ensemble , called the gue tracy - widom distribution , while flat interfaces on a linear substrate show the equivalent for gaussian orthogonal ensemble .",
    "this implies that the kpz class splits into a few universality subclasses .",
    "they are also characterized by different spatial correlation functions , whose exact forms are also known analytically @xcite .",
    "these results for the circular and flat subclasses were corroborated by direct experimental verifications using growing interfaces of turbulent liquid crystal ( lc ) @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these clear characterizations of the distribution and the spatial correlation , analytical results on the temporal correlation remain limited , hence challenging @xcite .",
    "the lc experiment @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite showed that the temporal correlation is also different between the circular and flat subclasses .",
    "firstly , the two - time correlation function denotes the ensemble average defined over infinitely many realizations .",
    "it is independent of @xmath2 because of the translational symmetry .",
    "therefore , for evaluation , we can take averages over positions too to achieve better statistical accuracy , without changing its mathematical definition . ]",
    "@xmath10 was shown to decay , in its rescaled form , as @xmath11 with @xmath12 for the flat case @xcite and @xmath13 for the circular case @xcite .",
    "the latter implies @xmath14 , i.e. , correlation remains strictly positive , forever , in the circular case .",
    "secondly , the persistence probability @xmath15 was also measured , which is defined here by the probability that the fluctuation @xmath16 at a fixed position @xmath2 never changes its sign ( from the one denoted by the subscript ) in the time interval @xmath17 $ ] based on the ensemble average is sometimes called the `` survival probability '' , in which case the term `` persistence probability '' is reserved for the probability that the sign of @xmath18 is unchanged @xcite . however , in the present paper , we define our persistence probability by the ensemble average ( unless otherwise stipulated ) , following earlier studies of direct relevance . ] .",
    "this quantity was found to show a power - law decay @xmath19 with exponents @xmath20 for the flat interfaces @xcite holds when the underlying kpz nonlinearity @xmath21 is positive , otherwise the order is reversed @xcite .",
    "note also that the estimates obtained in @xcite are somewhat different from those from the lc experiment @xcite .",
    "we believe this is because of the different choice of the reference time @xmath22 : while it was taken to be right after the initial condition in @xcite , times in the asymptotic kpz regime were used in the lc experiment @xcite .",
    "this is also the choice of the present paper ; therefore , here we refer to the estimates from the lc experiment , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , as the values of the persistence exponents for the flat kpz subclass . ] and @xmath25 for the circular ones @xcite .",
    "the latter implies divergence of the mean persistence time @xmath26 in the circular case .",
    "it has been shown that such a divergent mean leads to anomalous dynamics such as non - ergodicity , anomalous diffusion , aging , and population splitting @xcite .",
    "therefore , the above observations on the circular kpz subclass imply that it may also be understood in this line of research .",
    "ergodicity is a basic concept in statistical physics and dynamical systems .",
    "it guarantees that time - averaged observables obtained by single trajectories converge to a constant ( ensemble average ) as time goes on .",
    "ergodicity breaks down when , e.g. , the phase space consists of mutually inaccessible regions , because then single trajectories are unable to cover the whole phase space .",
    "however , in 1992 , bouchaud @xcite proposed another situation of ergodicity breaking , where the phase space is not split , but trajectories undergo long and random trapping .",
    "if the mean trapping time diverges , trajectories can not sufficiently explore the phase space , however long they do .",
    "interestingly , in this situation named weak ergodicity breaking ( web ) @xcite , certain time - averaged observables such as the time - averaged diffusion coefficient @xcite and the fraction of time occupied by a given state @xcite do not converge to their ensemble average , but themselves become well - defined random variables , described by characteristic distribution functions in simple cases .",
    "the existence of such an asymptotic broad distribution for time - averaged quantities is usually regarded as a defining property of web .",
    "experimentally , single - particle observations have indeed shown relevance of web in macromolecule diffusion in biological systems @xcite and in blinking quantum dots @xcite . however ,",
    "it remains unclear , both theoretically and experimentally , how useful these developments on web are to characterize many - body problems such as the kpz class .",
    "therefore , it is a challenging and important issue to clarify if web occurs in kpz , and if yes , characterize the web of the kpz class .",
    "to investigate possible relationship between web and kpz , we construct a dichotomous process from height fluctuations of kpz - class interfaces , @xmath27 $ ] , which is then regarded as a time series .",
    "such dichotomization has recently been used to characterize time - correlation properties of interactions on lipid membranes @xcite and of turbulence @xcite , successfully .",
    "the constructed process is compared with a theoretically defined dichotomous process , arguably the simplest and best - studied one , namely the renewal process ( rp ) @xcite .",

    "more specifically , we define the waiting - time distribution @xmath38 by the probability that the sign renewed at time @xmath3 ( changed to the subscripted one ) lasts over time length @xmath39 or longer , hence @xmath38 is the complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf )",

    "this similarity to rp leads us to compare further statistical properties between the two systems .",
    "first we focus on the forward recurrence time @xmath45 , defined as the interval between time @xmath3 and the next sign change , as well as the backward recurrence time @xmath46 , which is the backward interval from @xmath3 to the previous sign change @xcite . for rp , dynkin @xcite derived exact forms of the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath45 and @xmath46 as follows , for @xmath29 : @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 denoting the pdf of the beta distribution .",
    "although their derivation essentially relies on the independence of waiting times in rp , a feature not shared with kpz , we find , as shown in fig .",
