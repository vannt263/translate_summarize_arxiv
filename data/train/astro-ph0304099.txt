    "i review accretion models and their application to sgr a*.    a unique feature of the galactic center is our ability to constrain the dynamics of gas quite close to the black hole ( relative to other systems ) , thus providing additional boundary conditions on , and much less freedom for , theoretical models .",

    "1997 ) , implying that there should also be a global outflow of hot gas from the central parsec ( a gc wind ) . ]",
    "if gas were accreted at this rate onto the bh via a geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , a model that has been extensively and successfully applied to luminous accreting sources ( e.g. , kortakar & blaes 1999 ) , the expected luminosity would be @xmath20 ergs s@xmath19 , larger than the observed luminosity by a factor of @xmath21 .",
    "this is the strongest argument against a thin disk in sgr a*. an additional argument is the absence of any disk - like blackbody emission component in the spectrum of sgr a*.",
    "if the putative disk were to extend all the way down to the bh , its accretion rate would have to be @xmath22 yr@xmath23 to satisfy infrared limits ( e.g. , narayan 2002 ; see his fig .",
    "one possible caveat to the bondi analysis is that there is far more ( by mass ) cold molecular gas than hot x - ray emitting gas in the central @xmath24 parsecs of the gc ( e.g. , herrnstein & ho 2002 ) .",
    "it is unclear how close to the bh the molecular gas extends and whether it is important for the dynamics of gas accreting onto the bh . in what follows",
    "i ignore this component , but see nayakshin ( 2003 ) for a different view .    as emphasized above , the inferred low efficiency of sgr a * is the strongest argument against accretion proceeding via a thin accretion disk . instead",
    ", the observations favor models in which very little of the gravitational potential energy of the inflowing gas is radiated away .",
    "i will refer to such models as radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) . in the next section (  2 )",
    "i summarize the properties of riafs .",
    "i then apply these models to the gc (  3 ) , emphasizing the interpretation of radio and x - ray observations of sgr a*. finally , i conclude with a brief summary (  4 ) .",
    "riafs describe the dynamics of rotating accretion flows in which @xmath25 , i.e. , very little energy generated by accretion is radiated away ( e.g. , ichimaru 1977 ; rees et al .",
    "1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 ) .",
    "instead , the gravitational potential energy released by turbulent stresses in the accretion flow is stored as thermal energy . as a result , the accreting gas is very hot , with a characteristic thermal energy comparable to its gravitational potential energy ; close to the bh this implies @xmath26 k. at such temperatures , and for gas densities appropriate to systems like the gc , the coulomb collision time is much longer than the time it takes gas to flow into the bh .",
    "the accretion flow then develops a two - temperature structure with the protons likely hotter than the electrons : @xmath27 k @xmath28 k. the precise electron temperature is uncertain but important since electrons produce the radiation that we see .",
    "the electron temperature depends on how and to what extent they are heated by processes such as shocks , mhd turbulence , and reconnection ( see , e.g. , quataert & gruzinov 1999 ) .",
    "note that because collisions are unimportant one would not expect the electron distribution function to be thermal .",
    "advection - dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) are a simple analytical model for the dynamics of riafs ; they predict that the structure of the flow is in some ways similar to spherical bondi accretion , despite the fact that angular momentum and viscosity are important ( e.g. , ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1994 ) . in adaf models",
    "the gas rotates at @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the keplerian rotation rate . because the flow is hot , pressure forces are also important and the inflowing gas is geometrically quite `` thick , '' with a scale height @xmath31 at every radius .",
    "the radial velocity in the flow is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter , @xmath34 is the sound speed in the flow and @xmath35 .",
    "conservation of mass on spherical shells then implies that the density scales as @xmath36 , the characteristic scaling for spherical accretion .",
    "_ adaf models also predict that , even in the presence of rotation , the rate at which gas accretes onto the bh from an ambient medium is comparable to the bondi accretion rate : @xmath37_. ( e.g. , narayan 2002 ) .",
    "the factor of @xmath33 arises because the inflow velocity of gas at the bondi accretion radius is @xmath38 in adaf models while it is @xmath39 in bondi models .",
    "thus for a fixed density in the ambient medium , the accretion rate in an adaf will be smaller by a factor of @xmath33 . ] _ thus in adaf models the low luminosity of sgr a * is due to a very low radiative efficiency @xmath40 .",
    "_    with the advent of global , time - dependent , numerical simulations of accretion flows , it has become possible to numerically simulate riafs and test the adaf predictions . note that riafs are , in one sense , the easiest flows to simulate since ( 1 ) no treatment of radiation or radiative transfer is needed and ( 2 ) the flow is `` thick '' with @xmath41 , so there is no difficult - to - simulate separation of scales like in a thin disk . on the other hand , for a system like the gc ,",
    "the proton - electron collision time close to the bh is @xmath42 orders of magnitude longer than the inflow time of the gas .",
    "thus the fluid approximation used by all simulations to date is suspect ( a kinetic treatment should be used ; see quataert et al . 2002 ) . whether this introduces qualitative or merely quantitative errors in the results",
    "is unknown .",
    "i suspect the latter .",
    "the key result from nearly all simulations to date is that _ @xmath43 , i.e. , very little mass available at large radii actually accretes onto the black hole _ ( e.g. , stone , pringle , & begelman 1999 ; igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 ; 2000 ; igumenshchev et al .",
    "2000 ; stone & pringle 2001 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ; igumenshchev et al .",
    "another way to state this result is that the radial density profile in the flow is much `` flatter '' than the adaf predictions : for a given gas density at large distances from the black hole ( e.g. , measured by _",
    "chandra _ on 1  scales in the gc ) , the density close to the bh is much _ less _ than the adaf or bondi predictions . following a proposal due to blandford & begelman ( 1999 ) , we can parameterize the density profile of riafs with a parameter @xmath44 , where @xmath45 . with this parameterization ,",
    "the rate at which gas is actually accreted into the bh is @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the inner radius of the flow and @xmath48 is the outer radius .",
    "values of @xmath49 , rather than @xmath50 predicted by adaf models , are favored by the simulations .",
    "_ this implies that , within the context of riaf models , a low accretion rate , @xmath51 , rather than just a low efficiency , is a major factor in the faintness of sgr a*. _",
    "since the focus of this review is the application of riaf models to sgr a * , i will not dwell on why the simulations differ so significantly from the adaf predictions .",
    "a brief discussion is , however , in order .",
    "the following material will not be used in later sections so uninterested readers can move directly to  3 .    in riafs ,",
    "the inflowing gas is heated at a rate @xmath52 , as required by the release of gravitational potential energy in a differentially rotating accretion flow . in adaf models",
    "this energy is stored as thermal energy and carried into the bh . as noted above",
    ", the inflowing gas is then very hot with a sound speed at any radius comparable to the escape speed from the bh s potential well .",
    "adaf models are therefore prone to developing outflows ( see narayan & yi 1994 or blandford & begelman 1999 for a more formal discussion ) .",
    "this led blandford & begelman ( 1999 ) to propose that , in the absence of radiation , the gravitational binding energy of the accreted gas must be lost through some other ( non - radiative ) means .",
    "otherwise the inflowing gas is not sufficiently bound to the bh to accrete .",
    "the numerical simulations to date are broadly consistent with this hypothesis ; e.g. , the gas temperature in the simulations is generally a factor of few-5 less than in adaf models implying that the gas is indeed more strongly bound to the bh",
    ".    the non - radiative energy loss can take one of two forms : ( 1 ) efficient turbulent transport of energy through the accretion flow to large radii or ( 2 ) a global outflow ( wind ) that carries away the binding energy of the accreted matter .",
    "in hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , stone et al .",
    "1999 ; igumenshchev & abramowicz 1999 ) or in mhd simulations with relatively weak magnetic fields ( @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the ratio of the gas pressure to the magnetic pressure ) , convective transport of energy and angular momentum dominates the dynamics of the accretion flow ( narayan et al . 2002",
    "; igumenshchev et al . 2003 ; see quataert & gruzinov 2000a and narayan et al .",
    "2000 for such convection - dominated accretion flow models ) .",
    "the convective luminosity through a spherical shell at radius @xmath55 is @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the turbulent convective velocity . since the flow is hot , @xmath58 .",
    "a constant flow of gravitational binding energy from small to large radii therefore requires @xmath59 ; i.e. , @xmath60 instead of @xmath50 as in adaf models . or from the surface layers of the accretion flow .",
    "thus there is not necessarily a clean distinction between global energy transport by turbulence and mass outflow as mechanisms for non - radiative energy loss .",
    "both processes are related and , in particular , the former can drive the latter . ]",
    "in contrast to the hydrodynamic results , in mhd simulations with strong magnetic fields ( @xmath61 ) , mhd turbulence dominates the flow dynamics and convection is unimportant ( e.g. , stone & pringle 2001 ; hawley & balbus 2002 ; igumenshchev et al .",
    "stone & pringle ( 2001 ) and hawley & balbus ( 2002 ) find that most of the inflowing gas is lost to a magnetically driven wind .",
    "igumenshchev et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , on the other hand , find a much more complex flow configuration , though still with a very small accretion rate .",
    "a number of authors have used riaf models , and in particular adaf models , to explain the observed properties of sgr a * ( e.g. , narayan et al . 1995 , 1998 ; manmoto et al . 1997 ) .",
    "these calculations have shown that an adaf model accreting at the observationally inferred rate , @xmath62 , can roughly account for the observed luminosity and spectrum of sgr a*. the key constraint is that the fraction of the turbulent energy that heats the electrons , @xmath63 , must be small @xmath64 , so as to not overproduce the observed luminosity .",
    "equivalently the electron temperature close to the bh must be @xmath65 k @xmath66 k. an example of such a model in shown by the dotted line in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the model roughly reproduces the observed sub - mm emission , satisfies the ir limits , and produces an x - ray luminosity comparable to that seen by _",
    "chandra _ in the quiescent ( non - flaring ) state ( i discuss the _ chandra _ observations in more detail below ) .",
    "it does , however , significantly underproduce the lower frequency radio emission .",
    "since the lower frequency radio emission in sgr a * is phenomenologically similar to that of other agn , a natural interpretation is that a jet is present and produces the radio emission ( e.g. , falcke & markoff 2000 , yuan et al .",
    "2001 , and references therein ) . alternatively",
    ", the results in figure [ fig:1 ] assume purely thermal electrons , for which there is no good justification . as figure [ fig:2 ] shows , even a small population of nonthermal electrons in the accretion flow can produce the radio emission ( e.g. , mahadevan 1998 ; ozel et al .",

    "the key requirement is that the electrons must be hotter so as to produce more emission even though @xmath70 and the gas density are lower .",
    "an example of such a model is shown by the solid line in figure [ fig:1 ] : @xmath71 from @xmath72 down to @xmath73 , implying that the accretion rate into the bh is much smaller than the bondi rate ( @xmath74 ) .",

    "i summarize the constraints imposed by the linear polarization detection : accretion at @xmath79 implies a much higher gas density and magnetic field strength close to the black hole than accretion at @xmath80 .",
    "faraday rotation is therefore much stronger ( e.g. , quataert & gruzinov 2000b ; agol 2000 ) . in models with @xmath81 ,",
    "the rotation measure is @xmath82 in the region of the flow ( @xmath83 ) where the sub - mm emission is produced .",
    "this leads to a faraday rotation angle @xmath21 rad at @xmath84 ghz .",
    "this large rotation angle implies that intrinsically linearly polarized synchrotron emission would be depolarized propagating to the observer over most of the radio to infrared spectrum . by contrast , bower et al .",

    "for example , for @xmath88 , the net rotation measure through the accretion flow is @xmath89 , consistent with the observational constraint .",
    "thus the observed detection of linear polarization in the sub - mm emission of sgr a * argues for a low accretion rate @xmath90 .",
    "one way out of this conclusion is to posit that the magnetic field undergoes so many reversals along the line of sight that the net faraday rotation is @xmath91 times smaller than these simple estimates ( ruszkowski & begelman 2002 ) .",
    "i regard this as very unlikely , but am not aware of a direct observational argument against this possibility at the present time .    in light of the above arguments the rest of my discussion centers on models with @xmath87 :",
    "these concordance models are both theoretically favored and satisfy the rotation measure constraint from the linear polarization detection .",
    "i focus on interpreting the _ chandra _ x - ray observations of sgr a*. much of this material is based on quataert ( 2002 ) and yuan , quataert , & narayan ( 2003 ) .",
    "_ chandra _ observations reveal that there are two components to the x - ray emission coincident with sgr a * ( baganoff et al .",
    "2001 , 2003ab ) : ( 1 ) a baseline x - ray flux with a nearly constant luminosity @xmath92 ergs s@xmath19 and a soft spectrum ( photon index @xmath93 , where @xmath94 ) .",
    "this component is clearly extended with a size of @xmath95 and does not vary in time .",
    "( 2 ) x - ray flares occurring at a rate of @xmath96 day@xmath19 and lasting @xmath97 s. the luminosity increases by a factor of few@xmath98 during the flare and the spectrum is quite hard ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "the flares are not extended ; in fact , the observed timescales argue that they arise close to the bh , at @xmath83 .",
    "the x - ray flares are the most dramatic result from the _ chandra _ observations .",
    "markoff et al . (",
    "2001 ) showed that the flares are probably due to electron heating or acceleration , rather than a change in the accretion rate onto the bh ( otherwise there is too much variation in other wavebands ) .",
    "an obvious analogue is magnetic reconnection in solar flares , which one could readily imagine occurring in the inner part of the accretion flow close to the bh .",
    "given an injection of energy into the electrons , there are three emission mechanisms that could , _ a priori _ , give rise to flares : ( 1 ) bremsstrahlung , ( 2 ) synchrotron , and ( 3 ) inverse compton .",
    "bremsstrahlung is attractive because it can naturally explain the very hard spectrum of the flares .",
    "the problem is that , to produce a luminosity of @xmath100 ergs s@xmath19 from a sphere of radius @xmath55 , the gas density must be @xmath101 @xmath11 , where @xmath102 . for comparison ,",
    "the ambient density in the inner @xmath103 for a model with @xmath104 is @xmath105 @xmath11 .",
    "equally importantly , bremsstrahlung emission in riafs is dominated by very large radii @xmath106 , not small radii ( e.g. , quataert & narayan 1999 ; see below ) .",
    "thus bremsstrahlung appears unlikely to be responsible for the x - ray flares .",
    "two possible ways out of this conclusion are ( 1 ) to posit that the gas density increases by a factor of @xmath107 during the flare , and does so preferentially in the very inner part of the accretion flow ( e.g. , liu & melia 2002 ) .",
    "it is unclear , however , what would drive such large density changes , particularly since the cooling time is so long that thermally driven instabilities are unlikely to be important , ( 2 ) perhaps the accreting gas is a two - phase medium , with a cooler , denser phase giving rise to the x - ray flares ( yuan et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in contrast to bremsstrahlung , synchrotron emission can readily account for the observed flares : if @xmath108 of the electrons ( by energy ) are accelerated into a power - law tail in the inner @xmath109 , the radio - ir emission is essentially unchanged while electrons with lorentz factors @xmath110 can produce the x - ray emission ( e.g. , markoff et al . 2001 ) .",
    "moreover , there is a natural explanation for the hard x - ray spectrum seen . for riaf models with @xmath104 ,",
    "the magnetic field strength close to the bh is @xmath111 g. the associated synchrotron cooling time for electrons emitting in the _ chandra _ band is @xmath112 s. thus , unless @xmath113 g in the emitting region , the cooling time is less than the duration of the flare and there should be a cooling break in the electron distribution function below the _ chandra _ band . for an injected distribution of power - law electrons with @xmath114 , where @xmath115 , the distribution function for the population of cooled electrons is @xmath116 .",
    "this implies a synchrotron spectrum with @xmath117 , consistent with the typical flare observed by _",
    "( baganoff et al .",
    "2003b ) .",
    "synchrotron self - compton emission can also explain the x - ray flares observed by _",
    "the dashed line in figure [ fig:2 ] shows a concrete example in which most of the electrons in a @xmath118 volume are accelerated into a power law distribution .",
    "this population of electrons produces synchrotron emission and also upscatters synchrotron photons to produce a hard x - ray flare .",
    "note that there is very little change to the radio or ir emission ( the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows the baseline non - flaring model in which power - law electrons have only @xmath69 of the electron thermal energy ) .    finally , it is important to stress that in the models discussed here , the duration of the flare is set by a dynamical or viscous timescale in the inner @xmath119 of the accretion flow .",
    "by contrast , there is no explanation for the mean time between flares , @xmath96 day .",
    "in addition , it is difficult to apply the ideas considered here to the week - long , factor of few , sub - mm flares observed by tsuboi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and zhao et al .",
    "in particular the duration of these flares is inconsistent with the characteristic timescales in the sub - mm emitting region ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "one possibility is that they are not directly related to the _ chandra _ flares but are instead due to small fluctuations in @xmath70 set by dynamics in the accretion flow at larger radii .",
    "the steady quiescent emission observed by _",
    "chandra _ is qualitatively different from the flaring emission . in particular , it is softer ( @xmath93 ) and extended ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "the latter fact implies that it is a different emission component since synchrotron and inverse compton emission are produced at small radii .",
    "riaf models naturally predict that the thermal bremsstrahlung emission is dominated by large radii in the flow ( e.g. , quataert & narayan 1999 ; ozel & di matteo 2000 ) . given a density profile of the form @xmath45 and a temperature profile @xmath121 ( valid at large radii ) , the bremsstrahlung luminosity is dominated by large radii : @xmath122 , assuming photon energies @xmath123 .",
    "the resulting spectrum , adding up all radii , is @xmath124 , i.e. , @xmath125 .",

    "this conclusion is theoretically attractive because it implies that the radiative efficiency of sgr a * need not be as low as @xmath40 as in bondi and adaf models ( which has always been difficult to reconcile with the expectation that electron heating and acceleration would be important in the collisionless magnetized plasma close to the bh ) .",
    "a low accretion rate is also strongly suggested by the detection of linear polarization in the sub - mm emission from sgr a * : faraday rotation constrains the gas density and magnetic field strength close to the bh and argues for @xmath144 , in good agreement with the inference from riaf models .",
    "finally , riaf models with @xmath145 can explain the basic spectral properties of sgr a * ( see , e.g. , figs . [ fig:1 ] & [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the x - ray flares seen by _",
    "chandra _ may be due to synchrotron or inverse - compton emission produced by relativistic electrons accelerated in the inner @xmath119 of the accretion flow (  3.1 ) .",
    "it is important to stress that , although @xmath87 is both theoretically and observationally favored , all of the models considered here are still `` radiatively inefficient , '' and have efficiencies much less than the canonical thin disk value of @xmath146 ; e.g. , for @xmath145 , @xmath147 .",
    "in fact , all of the physics highlighted in  2 that suppresses the accretion rate with respect to the bondi estimate requires a relatively low efficiency and would not operate in a thin disk .",
    "there are several important issues that i have not addressed in this review . to cite two that clearly require further study : ( 1 ) are the _ chandra _ flares due to , e.g. ,",
    "reconnection or turbulence in the accretion flow , or are they telling us something more fundamental about the dynamics close to the bh ? ( 2 ) both jet and riaf models can explain the basic spectral properties of sgr a*. how can we distinguish between these two components , both of which are almost certainly present ?",
    "e.g. , is the linear polarization detection , which requires a relatively coherent magnetic field , consistent with the magnetic field seen in riaf simulations ? or does it instead require an additional jet component ?      10 aitken , d. k. et al .",
