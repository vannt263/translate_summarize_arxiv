    "in many theoretical treatments of condensed matter systems , the hamiltonian consists of a sum of kinetic energy and coulomb potential energy . in reality , the transverse electromagnetic ( radiation ) fields are also important .",
    "if the transverse electromagnetic field is included in the description of condensed matter , then phenomena such as the casimir effect@xcite , the lamb shift@xcite and the long ranged inter - molecular interaction forces@xcite can be explained employing standard low order quantum electrodynamic perturbation theory .",
    "if the coupling of the transverse electromagnetic field with matter is strong enough to produce an instability in the photon oscillators , then a transition occurs from a normal radiative phase to a super - radiant phase .",
    "the dicke model@xcite has been studied as a prime example of this phase transition . in the dicke model , many two level molecules interact with a single photon mode of the radiation field .",
    "the dicke model has been extensively studied by many workers@xcite , each adopting a somewhat different method to explain the physical properties of the system .",
    "hepp and lieb@xcite , analyzed the thermodynamic properties of the dicke maser model and elucidated the mathematical structure of the super - radiant phase transition .    in subsequent works of wang and hoe@xcite and hepp and lieb@xcite ,",
    "the coherent states of glauber @xcite were employed for multi - photon oscillators in the dicke model and the resulting phase transition has been investigated in great detail in these papers . the existence of such phase transitions in condensed matter systems has been investigated in a series of papers by preparata and coworkers@xcite .",
    "preparata has proposed several examples of super - radiant phases in a recent review@xcite .",
    "water@xcite is a particularly interesting example .",
    "the purpose of this work is to present a very direct method for computing the thermodynamic region wherein super - radiant phase exists .",
    "when a condensed matter system interacts with the electromagnetic field , the field degrees of freedom may be described by a renormalized thermodynamic potential . for small oscillator displacements ( in the normal radiation phase )",
    "the effective potential is parabolic .",
    "as the thermodynamic parameters change , the effective oscillator frequency may turn imaginary .",
    "the resulting oscillator instability is the signature of the phase transition into a super - radiant state .    in sec .",
    "ii , the statistical thermodynamic method for calculating the effective potential of a photon oscillator mode will be discussed .",
    "the conditions for the stability of the oscillator will be exhibited . in sec .",
    "iii , the dynamics in real time of the oscillator will be discussed in terms of the photon mode propagator .",
    "the conditions for dynamic real time stability are shown to be the same as for thermodynamic stability . in sec .",
    "iv , the example of a mesoscopic object placed in an optical cavity is considered .",
    "if the mesoscopic object has a sufficiently high polarizability , then a cavity mode can become unstable . in the sec .",
    "v , the nature of the non - linear forces which stabilize the oscillator mode in the super - radiant phase are explored .",
    "the shift in the equilibrium position required to stabilize the oscillator in the low temperature super - radiant phase is exhibited . in the concluding sec .",
    "vi , the notion of super - radiance with electric dipole coupling is related to the notion of coherent ferro - electricity . a material grain with a high electric polarizability , but otherwise without a net dipole moment , can be _ induced _ into a ferro - electric phase by an interaction with transverse electric fields . the transverse fields may induce a coherence in the electronic states then yielding a net electric dipole moment .",
    "let us consider a simple harmonic oscillator with momentum @xmath0 , displacement @xmath1 and frequency @xmath2 .",
    "the oscillator is coupled to a thermal bath described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",

    "the total hamiltonian is then @xmath7 which determines the total free energy @xmath8 via @xmath9    if @xmath10 and @xmath11 are classical to a sufficient degree of accuracy , then the the _ total trace _ may be approximated by @xmath12 from eqs.(1 - 4 ) one obtains @xmath13",

    "@xmath6 , the shifted frequency @xmath24 of the oscillator is given by @xmath25    the frequency shift ( from @xmath26 downward to @xmath27 ) of the oscillator due to the interaction of the oscillator with the thermal bath is given by @xmath28 the oscillator is `` stable '' if the shifted frequency is real ; i.e. @xmath29 or equivalently @xmath30 the oscillator is `` unstable '' if the shifted frequency is imaginary ; i.e. @xmath31 or equivalently @xmath32    one may appreciate the dynamical significance of the shifted frequency by considering the spectral density @xmath33 of the force fluctuations @xcite defined by @xmath34 for equal times @xmath35 the classical fluctuation response theorem asserts that @xmath36 where @xmath37 for @xmath38 is the dynamic damping coefficient for the oscillator .",
    "@xmath37 will be discussed in detail in sec .",
    "iii below .",
    "here we note that eqs.(13 ) , ( 17 ) and ( 18 ) imply that @xmath39    if the integrated ( over frequency ) dissipative damping on the right hand side of eq.(19 ) is sufficiently large , the the oscillator becomes unstable .",
    "the oscillator will be stable for @xmath40 eq.(20 ) has been here deduced by statistical thermodynamic reasoning .",
    "however , it is perhaps more simple to deduce eq.(20 ) directly from the simple dynamical equations of motion for the oscillator .",
    "let us now consider a simple harmonic oscillator with a canonical momentum @xmath0 , displacement @xmath1 and frequency @xmath41 .",
    "the oscillator is driven by a small time varying external force @xmath42 .",
    "the total hamiltonian , including the external force is then @xmath43 where @xmath44 is defined in eq.(2 ) . in a phenomenological linear response theory ,",
    "the small mean deviation from thermal equilibrium in the oscillator coordinate obeys the equation of motion @xmath45 where @xmath46 represents the induced change in the frictional damping force exerted on the coordinate by the thermal bath .    for simple engineering purposes",
    ", one often considers that the frictional damping force has a simple local ( in time ) form @xmath47 .",
    "more generally , the damping force will be non - local in time ; i.e. @xmath48    for complex frequency @xmath49 , with @xmath50 , if @xmath51 then @xmath52 defines the dynamical oscillator propagator @xmath53 . from eqs.(23 ) and ( 25 ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 from eqs.(22 ) , ( 25 ) and ( 26 ) , one finds that @xmath56 i.e. @xmath57 is the `` self energy '' of the harmonic oscillator propagator .",

    "if the dynamical oscillator propagator is presumed to be retarded , it too must satisfy a dispersion relation @xmath66 if the oscillator is stable , then causality is obeyed with the dissipative condition @xmath67 .",
    "the response function @xmath68 is then analytic in the upper half @xmath69 of the complex frequency plane .    on the other hand",
    "if the oscillator is unstable , then at least one pole at @xmath70 appears in the upper - half plane and the dispersion relation eq.(35 ) for the dynamical oscillator propagator is no longer valid .",
    "the occurrence of an instability in the system can be viewed as inducing the non - analyticity of the dynamical oscillator propagator given in eq.(28 ) . to locate an unstable oscillator pole in the upper half plane at @xmath71 ,",
    "we look for a zero in the denominator of eq.(28 ) ; i.e. @xmath72 from eqs.(31 ) and ( 36 ) we seek a solution for @xmath73 of the equation @xmath74 as a function of imaginary frequency in the range @xmath75 , it is evident that the right hand side of eq.(36 ) is smoothly and monotonically decreasing from @xmath76 to zero , while the left hand side of eq.(36 ) is smoothly and monotonically increasing from @xmath77 to infinity . if @xmath78 , then the two smooth curves intersect at precisely one value of @xmath79 .",

    "let us finally suppose that a mesoscopic object is placed within the mode neighborhood .",
    "the mesoscopic object interacts with the electric field via the electric dipole moment @xmath92 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian between the mesoscopic object and the optical mode oscillator then takes the form @xmath93 so that the force on the oscillator coordinate is due to the electric dipole moment .",
    "the force is @xmath94 eq.(44 ) follows from eqs.(40 ) , ( 42 ) and ( 43 ) .    if the oscillator were driven by an external force at frequency @xmath95 , then from eqs.(25 ) and (",

    "the general nature of the non - linear forces which eventually stabilize the oscillator must come into play .",
    "the problem of how an oscillator reaches a new thermodynamic equilibrium position in the `` unstable '' regime can be discussed only in the context of a specific microscopic environmental hamiltonian @xmath104 which enters into eq.(7 ) .",

    "( ii ) below the critical temperature @xmath132 , the oscillator position shift @xmath133 ( required to restore stability ) increases as the temperature is lowered .",
