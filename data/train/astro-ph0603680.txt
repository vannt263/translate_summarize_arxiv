    "the radio - loud radio - quiet bimodality of quasars is one of the long - standing unsolved problems in the research of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . while the presence of two classes of quasars , radio - louds and radio - quiets with a deficiency of sources at intermediate radio powers ,",
    "was historically apparently well established ( e.g. , kellerman et al .",
    "1989 , miller et al .",
    "1990 , visnovsky et al .",
    "1992 ) , other studies have questioned the mere existence of a radio dichotomy ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "2000 , cirasuolo et al . 2003 ) , or have pointed out that larger samples are needed to put the bimodality on a firmer statistical basis ( hooper et al .",
    "on the other hand it was argued that carefully selected small , well - studied samples still reveal the bimodality ( e.g. , sulentic et al . 2003 ) , and that it is still present in a large sample of sdss - first galaxies ( iveciz et al . 2002 ) .",
    "approximately 15% of the quasar population is radio loud ( urry & padovani 1995 ) for reasons that are still unknown .",
    "a second question that is presently under close scrutiny is whether or not there are relations between black hole ( bh ) mass and radio loudness , and especially , whether or not there is a limiting bh mass above which objects are preferentially radio loud , and whether or not radio - louds and radio - quiets show the same spread in their black hole masses ( e.g. , laor 2000 , lacy et al .",

    "while most attention so far concentrated on the radio - loud radio - quiet distinction of quasars , extending the studies to other subtypes of agn may shed new light on both , the existence of a radio - loud radio - quiet bimodality and on the cause of radio loudness .",
    "we have started an investigation of the radio properties of narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies .",
    "apart from the topic just mentioned , the analysis of their radio properties is also of interest for addressing open questions in the study of nls1s , as detailed below .",
    "nls1 galaxies were identified by osterbrock & pogge ( 1985 ) as objects with small widths of the broad balmer lines .",
    "these go hand in hand with weak [ oiii]5007/h@xmath5 emission and strong emission from feii complexes ( e.g. , boroson & green 1992 ) .",
    "physical drivers of the nls1 phenomenon and correlations among emission - line and continuum properties are not yet well understood .",
    "there is growing evidence , though , that most nls1s are objects with high accretion rates , close to or even super - eddington , and low black hole masses",

    "2004 , collin & kawaguchi 2004 ) . apart from that",
    ", several other parameters were suggested to influence the main properties of nls1 galaxies , including orientation ( e.g. , osterbrock & pogge 1985 , bian & zhao 2004 ) , winds and density effects ( e.g. , lawrence et al . 1997 , wills et al . 2000 , bachev et al .",
    "2004 , xu et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 ) , metallicity ( e.g. mathur 2000 , komossa & mathur 2001 , shemmer & netzer 2002 , nagao et al .",
    "2002 , warner et al .",
    "2004 , fields et al . 2005 ) , and absorption ( e.g. , komossa & meerschweinchen 2000 , gierlinski & done 2004 ) .",
    "there is evidence that nls1s follow a different black hole mass  velocity dispersion ( @xmath6 ) relation than broad line seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. , mathur 2001 , grupe & mathur 2004 , mathur & grupe 2005 ) with important implications for galaxy evolution and black hole growth .",
    "while the x - ray and optical properties of nls1s were explored intensively in the last decade , relatively little is known about their radio properties .",
    "ulvestad et al . (",
    "1995 ) observed 7 nls1 galaxies with the vla and concluded that they are only of modest radio power and that radio emission is more compact than a few hundred parsec .",

    "rgb j0044 + 193 ( siebert et al . 1999 ) is radio - quiet most of the time ( maccarone et al . 2005 ) , but may have been radio - loud at the epoch of the 87 gb survey ( siebert et al . 1999 , maccarone et al .",
    "2005 ) due to variability in the radio band .",
    "pks 2004 - 447 ( oshlack et al . 2001 ) is a ( non - typical ) nls1 or possibly a narrow - line radio galaxy ( zhou et al .",
    "2003 ) and is very radio - loud .",
    "it is still a puzzle why radio - loud nls1 galaxies are scarce . in particular",
    ", it is still unclear whether they are truly preferentially radio quiet , or rather the scarcity of radio - louds is due to some selection effect .",
    "this question can be addressed by a systematic search for , and study of , radio - loud nls1s .",
    "the study of radio properties of nls1s , in particular their radio loudness and radio variability , also allows us to re - address the question whether nls1 galaxies are preferentially viewed face on .",
    "furthermore , radio observations of nls1 galaxies provide constraints on the coupling between jets and accretion disks ( e.g. , zdziarski et al .",
    "there are indications that objects with accretion rates close to the eddington rate tend to be radio - weaker ; a behavior observed in galactic x - ray binaries in soft / high - state and agn ( maccarone et al .",

    "2006 , and references therein ) .    here",
    ", we report results from a search for radio - loud and ` almost radio - loud ' nls1 galaxies , based on cross - correlating a catalogue of optically identified nls1s with radio catalogues .",
    "this is the first systematic study of ( non - radio - selected ) radio - loud nls1 galaxies , and of their radio , optical and x - ray properties .",
    "we use the term `` narrow - line seyfert 1 ( nls1 ) galaxy '' collectively for high - luminosity and low - luminosity objects , i.e. for narrow - line type 1 quasars and for narrow - line seyfert type 1 galaxies . a cosmology with @xmath7=70 km / s / mpc , @xmath8=0.3 and @xmath9=0.7",
    "is adopted throughout this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe our methods for cross - matching a large number of catalogues and present candidate radio - loud nls1 galaxies . in sections 3 and 4",
    "we provide results from our analysis of the optical and x - ray spectra of these nls1s .",
    "consequences of our results for nls1 models , and mechanisms to explain the lower frequency of radio - louds among nls1s than quasars are discussed in section 5 .",
    "in order to search for radio - loud nls1 galaxies and study their properties , we extracted all nls1 galaxies included in the 11th edition of the `` catalogue of quasars and active nuclei '' compiled by veron - cetty & veron ( 2003 ; henceforth referred to as vqc ) , separately for the catalogue of `` faint '' objects ( i.e. , seyferts fainter than absolute magnitude @xmath10 ) and the `` bright '' ones ( i.e , quasars brighter than @xmath10 ) .",
    "we present results for the narrow - line type 1 quasars here , while results for the seyfert galaxies will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the defining criterion for inclusion as nls1 galaxy in the vqc is a width of the h@xmath1 emission line fwhm@xmath11 km / s .",
    "the list of the 128 selected narrow - line quasars was then cross - correlated with the first ( `` faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters '' , at 1.4 ghz ; white et al .",
    "1997 , becker et al .",
    "1995 ) , nvss ( `` nrao vla sky survey '' , at 1.4 ghz ; condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , sumss ( `` sydney university molonglo sky survey '' , at 843 mhz ; mauch et al . 2003 ) , wenss ( `` westerbork northern sky survey '' , at 0.33 ghz ; de bruyn et al . 1998 ) , pmn ( `` parkes - mit - nrao '' radio survey including all , the southern survey , zenith survey , tropical survey , and equatorial survey , at 4.85 ghz ; griffith et al .",
    "1994 ) , 87 gb ( `` green bank radio survey '' , at 4.85 ghz ; gregory & condon 1991 ) and the pks ( `` parkes radio survey '' , at 2.7 ghz ; wright & otrupcek 1990 ) radio catalogues , in order to select all radio - detected nls1s , and among these the radio - loud ones .",
    "the input list was simultaneously cross - correlated with the usno - b1 ( monet et al . 2003 ) , usno - a2 and gsc2.2 optical photometry catalogues in order to obtain blue magnitudes .    for cross - matching of radio catalogues with optical catalogues we used the cross - matcher application developed within the german astrophysical virtual observatory ( gavo ) project .",
    "the gavo cross - matcher is a multi - archive , multi - server , multi - catalogue , statistical spatial matcher operating solely on astrometric coordinates and their uncertainties ( adorf et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) .    in our case",
    ", it takes as input an extract of the ` veron quasar catalogue ' which includes all nls1 galaxies in that catalogue and their coordinates . a query module then accesses the vizier archive and extracts coordinates and flux and magnitude data from selected catalogues in the archive .    while the vizier match - list services are capable of deterministically matching the input list against a single catalogue , we then proceed in matching the different output lists against each other in order to find the most likely single multiwavelength `` counterpart '' . in a first step ,",
    "match - candidates are generated in the following way : combinations of potential counterparts are formed , which are viewed as hypothetical `` clusters '' on the sky .",
    "for each such cluster its central position is computed , followed by a computation of the projected distances on the sky between each counterpart candidate and the central cluster position .",
    "next , based on the astrometric positions and associated uncertainties , for each counterpart in a given match candidate cluster its isotropic mahalanobis distance ( mahalanobis 1936 , devroye et al .",
    "1996 ) to the central cluster position is computed .",
    "it measures the statistical distance to the cluster center . for each cluster",
    "a goodness - of - fit criterion is computed , namely the standard  @xmath12-metric , which is simply the sum of the squared mahalanobis distances .",
    "it can be viewed as a measure of compactness of the cluster , where instead of the physical distances , the statistical distances are being used .",
    "since the number of counterparts contributing to a match candidate generally differs from candidate to candidate , we can not use the  @xmath12 metric directly for comparing the goodness of the match . instead the reduced  @xmath12 metric is computed . for the required degrees of freedom  @xmath13 we use @xmath14 , where  @xmath15 denotes the number of counterparts contributing to a match candidate .",
    "we subtract  @xmath16 in order to allow for the estimation ( `` fitting '' ) of the two sky - coordinates , i.e.  right ascension and declination , when computing the cluster center .",
    "a reduced-@xmath12 threshold parameter is used for discriminating against unreasonable match combinations .",
    "finally , for each remaining match candidate , the cross - matcher extracts the astrometry and optical and radio photometry data .",
    "position uncertainties , inherent to the different ( radio ) surveys , are either taken into account on an object - by - object basis if individual position errors are available ( this is generally the case for the first and 87 gb catalogues in vizier ; typically 1@xmath17 ( first ) and @xmath18 30@xmath17 ( 87 gb ) ) or else typical average position uncertainties @xmath19 for the different catalogues are used ( explicitly , @xmath19=1@xmath17 ( usno - a2,usno - b1,gsc2.2 ) , 7@xmath17 ( nvss ) , 30@xmath17 ( pks and pmn ) , 10@xmath17 ( sumss and wenss ) ) . the catalogue - specific search radii were typically larger by a factor of 3 .      while this automated way of simultaneously cross - correlating various catalogues and of selecting counterparts is generally very successful , there are still a number of `` peculiarities '' inherent to the way the catalogues were produced in general , or to individual galaxies in particular , which affect the cross - matching output and which make it necessary to check a number of results `` by hand '' .",
    "while the long term goal is to include most of these effects into the cross - correlation software , in this pilot project we paid special attention to actually identifying potential problems and effects that need closer attention in the future when applying similar cross - correlation methods to much larger samples .",
    "nearby bright galaxies are missed in blue magnitude catalogues because they are too extended and too bright for standard automated magnitude measurements to still work .",
    "this is not a problem for the present sample since the quasars are sufficiently distant but will be more severe for samples of nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "a few catalogued nls1s still have optical coordinate off - sets which are larger than expected in the optical band .",
    "one reason is that their iras coordinates rather than optical coordinates were still listed , which come with a larger uncertainty .",
    "therefore , counterparts in blue magnitudes and first radio sources might be missed . for the present sample , iras11598 - 0112 and rxj01354 - 0426",
    "were not assigned optical counterparts by the original cross - correlation procedure .",
    "iras11598 - 0112 had its iras coordinates catalogued , while the true optical coordinate then turns out to be consistent with the first radio position .",
    "the optical counterpart of rxj01354 - 0426 is off - set by @xmath03 - 4@xmath17 from the coordinate in the vqc .",
    "however , since there is no other good multi - wavelength counterpart in the field , we assume that optical , radio and x - ray source are one and the same .",
    "bright radio sources are often detected in several surveys with widely different positional uncertainties .",
    "in that case it is generally a good idea to then use the smallest positional error among the radio catalogues for further cross - correlation with non - radio catalogues to reduce the number of potential multi - wavelength match candidates . in the present study , in two cases ,",
    "a bright source was detected in several radio surveys , suggesting we deal with one and the same source , but the source coordinates in those radio surveys with small coordinate uncertainties were no longer consistent with the optical position . in the specific case of rxj07101",
    "+ 5002 , only a 87 gb counterpart was found by cross - correlation which is 45@xmath17 off the optical position .",
    "the 87 gb source has counterparts in several other radio catalogues including nvss and first , which show the same off - set from the optical coordinates and similar radio fluxes .",
    "this means the radio source is one and the same in all radio catalogues .",
    "however , given the small coordinate uncertainty in the first catalogue , it can no longer be related to the optical nls1 galaxy .",
    "the first image reveals a complex radio structure with several bright knots and lobes .",
    "we have checked that none of these sub - structures coincides with the optical nls1 .",
    "rather , the core of the radio galaxy does have a ` normal ' galaxy as optical counterpart , reported by bauer et al .",
    "the question remains whether the _ x - ray source _",
    "rxj07101 + 5002 then actually is the counterpart to the radio source ( as often assumed ; e.g. , bauer et al .",
    "2000 ) , or whether it is the counterpart to the optical nls1 galaxy , as concluded by xu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) who provided the optical spectroscopy of that source .",
    "the radio galaxy is radio loud with @xmath20=64 .",
    "we exclude it from the sample , though , since the nls1 galaxy is not its counterpart . in the case of sbs1330 + 519 ,",
    "only a wenss counterpart was found , off - set by 20@xmath17 .",
    "the wenss source has a first and nvss counterpart which , however , are too far off from the optical position of sbs1330 + 519 to be still considered as counterparts .",
    "sbs1330 + 519 was thus excluded from our sample .",
    "we note in passing that the relatively strong radio source itself does have a very faint optical counterpart in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) photometric catalogue ( abazajian et al . 2005 ) , sdssj133219.38 + 514439.9 . with sdss @xmath21 and @xmath22 magnitudes of 21.5 and 22.3 mag , respectively , this background object is very radio loud ( @xmath23=8940 ) .",
    "no optical spectrum is available .",
    "radio images of all radio - detected nls1s were inspected by eye to convince ourselves of the reliability of counterpart identification .      for all confirmed radio - detected objects their radio loudness",
    "was then estimated , following kellermann et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , who define the radio index @xmath2 as ratio of 6 cm radio flux to optical flux at 4400 .",
    "@xmath24 is commonly used to mark the `` border '' between radio - quiet and radio - loud objects , originally calculated based upon the assumption of similar spectral shapes in the optical and radio band with @xmath25 ( kellermann et al .",
    "radio - surveys employed in the present study generally measure at 1.4 ghz . still keeping the same assumptions , in particular , @xmath25 , we compute the radio index at 1.4 ghz as @xmath23=1.9@xmath2 , and we use @xmath23=19 as a reasonable distinction between radio - loud and radio - quiet objects .",
    "optical blue magnitudes m@xmath26 were extracted from the usno - b1 catalogue and used to calculate @xmath23 . for comparison , blue magnitudes from the first epoch of the usno - b1 ( m@xmath27 ) , the gsc2.2 ( m@xmath28 ) and the usno - a2 ( m@xmath29 ) catalogues",
    "were also collected to get an impression on the uncertainty in blue magnitude , which would be either due to source - intrinsic variability and/or measurement uncertainties .    as a last step",
    ", only a careful object - by - object check then allows to scrutinize which objects are actually radio - loud nls1 galaxies , or good candidates .",
    "in particular , peculiar intrinsic spectral shapes , high redshift , or heavy absorption , which will affect radio and optical band in a different way , would invalidate the simple way of calculating the radio index @xmath2 as ratio of _ observed _ radio to optical flux density . also , merging galaxies with close double nuclei make counterpart identification ambiguous .",
    "finally , optical spectroscopic classification of each radio - loud candidate needs to be checked carefully in order to confirm its nls1 nature .",
    "an uncertainty which generally can not be overcome with existing data given their non - simultaneity , is source variability either in the optical and/or radio band .        among the 128 nls1s in the vqc we find that 35 have radio counterparts in one or more catalogues . in fig .",

    "2006 ) , we may automatically miss some of the most massive radio - loud nls1s because they escape the definition as nls1s and are rather called seyfert 1s .    secondly , specific to the present sample , great attention was paid to each single object in that cautious comments were issued in case of evidence for excess extinction , and in that line profiles were fit with a number of different models . the same detailed object - by - object analysis",
    "should be applied to comparison samples of quasars , when citing the fraction of radio - loud quasars in comparison with that of radio - loud nls1 galaxies .    keeping this in mind",
    ", it still appears that radio - loud nls1s are less abundant than radio - loud quasars , and we proceed in attempting to explain this distinction .",
    "the cause of radio loudness in quasars is still unknown , even though a number of different models have been suggested and investigated including the influence of spin ( e.g. , wilson & colbert 1995 , blandford 2000 , ye & wang 2005 ) , black hole mass ( e.g. , laor 2000 , metcalf & magliocchetti 2006 ) , the rate of cooling gas in the host galaxy ( best et al . 2005 ) and beaming in radio - intermediate fsrqs which were suggested to be relativistically boosted radio - quiets ( miller et al .",
    "1993 , falcke et al .",

    "two key questions regarding the radio properties of the nls1 galaxies are : why is the phenomenon of radio loudness rarer in nls1 galaxies than in quasars ? and , related to that : is the mechanism which drives the radio loudness the same in both types of objects , or is a fundamentally different mechanism at work in the few radio - loud nls1s ?",
    "we discuss several models in turn .",
    "we first explore the possibility that nls1s might be radio - quiet but intrinsically beamed sources . in this scenario ,",
    "one then expects that other optical and x - ray properties of the radio - loud nls1s are affected as well .",
    "for instance , feii emission might be extreme if it originates in a disk which is viewed face on ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "also , x - ray soft excess emission is expected to be stronger if the sources are viewed face on for the case of a geometrically thick accretion disk ( madau 1998 ) . at the same time",
    "there might be a flatter non - thermal contribution to x - rays from the jet emission .    while a few sources of our sample are indeed good candidates for beaming , others are not .",

    "2002 ) and sdssj094857.3 + 002225 exhibits strong variability in the radio band ( zhou et al .",
    "these are the only two sources among our sample with very flat radio spectra ( tab .",
    "1 ) . apart from that",
    ", pks0558 - 504 exhibits unusual x - ray flaring activity and there have been repeated speculations that this may be related to beaming effects in a jet ( remillard et al .",
    "1991 , gliozzi et al .",
    "2001 , wang et al .",
    "an origin in the accretion disk is an alternative , though , and this latter model is preferred by wang et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and by brinkmann et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to explain the xmm data .",
    "other sources of our sample are steep spectrum radio sources where strong beaming is generally not expected .",
    "x - ray spectra are steep ( even those of the two fsrqs ) , arguing against the dominance of a non - thermal doppler - enhanced contribution to the soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "beamed sources more typically show @xmath113 .",
    "while estimated eddington accretion rates are in line with other findings that nls1 galaxies are accreting close to or above their eddington limit , the radio loudness of such sources is unexpected at first glance , given observations that radio emission is suppressed in accretion high - states in some types of galactic and extragalactic sources . according to maccarone et al .",
    "( 2003 , and references therein ) , galactic x - ray binaries in soft / high - state and agn show quenched radio emission for relatively high accretion rates . even though the analogy between galactic black holes and nls1 galaxies has been drawn repeatedly ( e.g. , pounds et al .",
    "1995 ) , it is still unclear how far it reaches .",
    "greene et al . ( 2006 , and references therein ) more generally suggested that radio loudness is anti - correlated with @xmath114 ( their fig .",
    "3 ) in a sample of seyferts and pg quasars , albeit with quite some scatter .",
    "whether this trend still holds for high - redshift , highly accreting quasars has yet to be explored .",
    "so far , these observations suggest , whatever the mechanism to suppress radio emission for high @xmath114 could also be responsible for the lower fraction of radio - louds among nls1s .    while it is generally agreed upon that jet formation ( and thus radio emission ) is intimately linked to the presence and structure of an accretion disk , the actual mechanism of launching a jet from the inner disk regions is not yet really understood ( see , e.g. , celotti & blandford 2001 and meier 2003 for recent reviews ) .",
    "one may speculate that the observed differences originate from differences in the accretion mode between stellar mass and super - massive black hole accretors and between different classes : it is generally agreeed upon that at relatively low accretion rates ( in terms of the eddington rate ) , radiatively inefficient accretion flows prevail ( e.g. , beckert & duschl 2002 ) .",
    "independent of yet not fully understood details of these flows , they seem to be potentially efficient in producing radio emission themselves ( e.g. , yi & boughn 1998 , narayan et al .",
    "1998 ) . at rates closer to , but still well below the eddington limit disks turn optically thick and geometrically thin ( see wang et al .",
    "2002 for a suggestion how radio - emission might be enhanced in this case ) . barring details at these low accretion rates",
    "the properties of the flows seem to be rather similar between stellar mass and super - massive black hole accretors .",
    "when the accretion rate reaches or even surpasses the eddington rate , however , the physical state of the accretion process becomes less clear .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the eddington rate has been derived for a perfectly spherically symmetric situation .",
    "the situation in accretion disks , however is rather different from such an ideal case . while at rates close to the ( spherical )",
    "eddington limit , accretion disks in all likelihood are no longer geometrically thin ( _ slim disks _ , see , e.g. , collin & kawaguchi 2004 ) , their deviation from sphericity is even more important .",
    "this can lead to simple geometrical effects allowing for super - eddington accretion rates ( heinzeller and duschl , _ in prep . _ ) , but also to instabilities in the structure of the disks , for instance the photon bubble instability as discussed by begelman ( 2002 ) , and in all likelihood to combinations of such geometrical and physical effects ( e.g. , okuda et al . 2005 ) .",
    "an additional potentially relevant difference between stellar mass and super - massive black hole accretors may be the mass of the disk .",
    "while in the stellar case the masses of the accretion disk are certainly well below that of the accreting body , this is considerably less clear for the agn case , and may be even different for different agn types . in the innermost disk regions ,",
    "selfgravity certainly plays no role . already at moderately large radii ,",
    "however , this may change . with such changes ,",
    "long - term modifications of the mass supply rate for the inner regions comes along .",
    "different levels of selfgravity in the disks may very well lead to differences in the accretion process .",
    "therefore , different accretion modes have the potential to explain the observed differences in radio loudness between galactic and agn sources on the one side , and among the different agn classes on the other side . before one , however , can unambiguously identify whether , and if so , which aspect of the accretion mode gives rise to the differences , a much better understanding is required of how these different accretion modes relate to jet formation .",
    "another parameter which could account for radio loudness but at the same time leave optical emission - line parameters and correlations mostly unaffected , is black hole spin .",
    "it is expected to have a strong direct influence on radio jet emission if the radio jet is powered by the extraction of black hole rotational energy ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) , or may indirectly be relevant if the jet is powered by the rotational energy of the inner disk ( blandford & payne 1982 ) .    if , indeed , rapidly spinning black holes are responsible for radio loudness of nls1s and quasars , why then would nls1s _ on average _ harbor _ less _ rapidly spinning black holes than seyferts ( to account for the lower frequency of radio - loudness among nls1s ) ?",
    "both bh - bh mergers and accretion will affect bh spin ( e.g. , merritt 2002 , hughes & blandford 2003 , volonteri et al . 2005 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that nls1 galaxies are less evolved than seyferts in that their black holes are still in the process of growing by rapid accretion ( e.g. , mathur 2001 , grupe & mathur 2004 , botte et al .",
    "2004 , mathur & grupe 2005 ) . since accretion processes are known to be very efficient in spinning up the accreting black holes ( volonteri et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) one then indeed expects that the final stages , ` normal ' seyferts and quasars , should have , on average , more rapidly spinning black holes than the nls1s .    at the same time , spin can not be the only quantity making objects radio - loud , else all quasars must be more radio - loud than nls1s . thus , spin would be a necessary but not sufficient condition . if , indeed , spin plays a role , then the few radio - loud nls1s should be those with the more rapidly spinning bhs , already more evolved than others .",
    "one may thus expect that they lie closer to the black - hole mass  velocity dispersion ( @xmath115 ) relation of seyfert galaxies than other nls1s .",
    "we have plotted the objects of our sample in the @xmath115 plane of mathur & grupe ( 2004 ; their fig . 1 ) and indeed find that they are systematically closer to , or on , the @xmath115 relation followed by seyferts .",
    "future x - ray observations of the iron line may help to search for signs of more rapidly spinning bhs in the radio - loud nls1s , but less rapidly spinning bhs in the nls1 population as a whole .    in summary",
    ", while we can not fully exclude beaming to operate in all sources , the source properties are generally such that this mechanism is not favored ( with the three exceptions mentioned above ) .",
    "accretion mode , possibly in combination with spin , is a possibility .      the results of this study",
    "lead us to identify a number of important follow - up observations :    high quality optical spectra of the 11 radio - loudest objects of our sample do not yet exist , or are not yet published .",
    "spectra of high resolution and s / n would allow a search for similarities / differences in emission lines between radio - loud and radio - quiet nls1s the same way it is now rigorously done for broad- and narrow - line objects ( e.g. , veron et al . 2001 , sulentic et al .",
    "2002 , bachev et al .",

    "this knowledge is essential for the assessment of radio loudness ( in reddened objects , radio loudness is overpredicted ) , and for black hole mass calculation .",
    "good optical spectra of the radio - loud and almost radio - loud nls1s , and a comparison sample of quasars , will enable bh mass and bulge mass estimates using h@xmath1 and [ oiii ] or low - ionization lines , and ideally also absorption features ( e.g. , grupe & mathur 2004 , botte et al . 2004 , greene & ho 2005 ) which will then allow us to test more rigorously whether claimed systematic trends of higher black hole masses in radio - loud vs. radio - quiet quasars extend to the nls1 population .",
    "x - ray observations of all sources are needed in order to measure accurate spectral shapes , few of them available so far , and to determine the amount of absorption .",
    "deeper x - ray observations are required to measure iron - line profiles in search for ( less ) rapidly spinning black holes in nls1 galaxies .",
    "how much of the scatter in radio spectral index of the nls1s is real and how much is caused by the non - simultaneity of the data , should be tested with simultaneous radio observations at different frequencies and monitoring for variability .",
    "the latter will also constrain the number of beamed sources .",
    "radio observations of higher spatial resolution should be carried out in order to confirm the compactness of the nls1s of our sample and thus also to check how far the similarity with known css sources goes .",
    "larger samples of agn with a ` relaxed ' nls1 classification criterion where the cut in fwhm is dependent on luminosity will enable us to address the question whether the fraction of radio - loud nls1s systematically changes ( increases ) with fwhm@xmath50 and whether ( radio - loud ) nls1s with higher bh masses emerge .",

    "nvss and first radio fluxes are consistent with each other in most cases , indicating little variability .",

    "x - ray properties are consistent with the nls1 population as a whole , with @xmath123 and @xmath124 erg / s ; some sources highly variable , others constant throughout the observation interval .",
    "the starburst contribution to the radio emission , estimated for those sources with iras 60@xmath83 detections , is small or completely negligible .",
    "the agn is expected to dominate any starburst in radio emission by factors 5115 .",
    "we do not find indications for beaming in most of the sources , arguing against the explanation that we see intrinsically radio quiet but beamed sources .",
    "accretion mode and spin might be factors to account for the lower frequency of radio - loud nls1 galaxies than quasars .",
    "future studies of radio - loud nls1s and follow - up observations of the sample presented here will provide important information on distinguishing between different nls1 models , on ( the existence of ) the radio - loud radio - quiet dichotomy of agn , and on accretion disk - jet models .",
