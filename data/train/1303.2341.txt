    "physics within the central parsecs of a galaxy is dominated by the gravitational potential of a compact supermassive object . in a classical theory of",
    "spherical accretion by @xcite , bondi radius @xmath4 determines the zone of the gravitational influence of a central object and it is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the central object mass , and @xmath7 is the temperature of the uniform surrounding medium . at radii smaller than the bondi radius , @xmath8 , the interstellar medium ( ism ) or at least its part",
    "is expected to turn into an accretion flow .",
    "physics of any part of a galaxy is complex .",
    "however near the bondi radius , it is particularly so because there , several processes compete to dominate not only the dynamical state of matter but also other states such as thermal and ionization",
    ". therefore studies of the central parsec of a galaxy require incorporation of processes and their interactions that are typically considered separately in specialized areas of astrophysics , e.g. , the black hole accretion , physics of ism and of the galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "one of the main goals of studying the central region of a galaxy is to understand various possible connections between a supermassive black hole  ( smbh ) and its host galaxy .",
    "electromagnetic radiation provides one of such connections .",
    "for example , the powerful radiation emitted by an agn , as it propagates throughout the galaxy , can heat up and ionize the ism .",
    "subsequently , accretion could be slowed down , stopped or turned into an outflow if the ism become unbound .",
    "studies of heated accretion flows have a long history",
    ". examples of early and key works include @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the accretion flows and their related outflows are very complex phenomena .",
    "it is likely that several processes are responsible for driving an outflow , i.e. , not just the energy of the radiation , as mentioned above , but also for example , the momentum carried by the radiation .",
    "our group explored combined effects of the radiation energy and momentum on the accretion flows and on producing outflows ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these papers reported on results from simulations carried out using eulerian finite difference codes where effects of gas rotation and other complications such non - spherical and non - azimuthal effects were included ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    to identify the key processes determining the gas properties ( here ,",
    "we are mainly concerned with thermal properties ) and to establish any code limitations in modeling an accretion flow , in this paper we adopt a relatively simple physical set up .",
    "namely , the modeled system consists of a central smbh of mass @xmath9 and a spherical shell of gas inflowing to the center .",
    "the simulations focus on regions between 0.1 - 200 pc from the central object , where the outer boundary is outside of @xmath4 .",
    "the key difference compared to the bondi problem is an assumption that the central accretion flow is a point - like x - ray source .",
    "the x - rays illuminate the accreting gas and the gas itself is allowed to cool radiatively under optically thin conditions . to keep the problem as simple as possible , the radiation luminosity is kept fixed instead of being computed based on the actual accretion rate for an assumed radiation efficiency",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",
    "to model the presented problem , one needs to introduce extra terms into the energy equation to account for energy losses and gains .",
    "the physics of an optically thin gas that is radiatively heated and cooled , in particular , its thermal and dynamical stability has been analyzed in a great detail by @xcite . therefore , to study thermal properties of accretion flows or dynamical properties of thermally unstable gas , it is worthwhile to combine @xcite and @xcite theories .",
    "notice , that our set - up is very similar that that used in the early works in the 70-ties and 80-ties that we mentioned above .",
    "some kind of complexity and time variability in a heated accretion flow is expected based on the 1-d results from the early work .",
    "a dynamical study of the introduced physical problem requires resolving many orders of magnitude of the radial distance from the black hole .",
    "our goal is not only to cover the largest radial span as possible but also to resolve any small scale structure of the infalling gas .",
    "this is a challenging goal . to study the dynamics of gas in a relatively well controlled computer experiment , we use the eulerian finite difference code zeus - mp @xcite .",
    "we address systematically numerical requirements to adequately treat the problem of thermally unstable accretion flows .",
    "we introduce an accurate heating - cooling scheme that incorporates all relevant physical processes of x - ray heating and radiative cooling .",
    "low optical thickness is assumed , which decouples fluid and radiation evolution .",
    "we resolve three orders of magnitude in the radial range by using a logarithmic grid where the logarithm base is adjusted to the physical conditions .",
    "we solve hydrodynamical equations in 1- and 2- spatial dimensions ( 1-d and 2-d ) .",
    "we follow the flow dynamics for a long time scale in order to investigate the non - linear phase of gas evolution .",
    "notice that most of the earlier work in the 70-ties and 80-ties , focused on linear analysis of stability , early stages of evolution of the solutions , and considered only 1-d cases .    as useful our group s past studies are",
    ", we keep in mind that any result should be confirmed by using more than one technique or approach .",
    "therefore , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , began a parallel effort to model accretion flows including the same physics but instead of performing simulations using a grid based code we used the smoothed particle hydrodynamic ( sph ) gadget-3 code @xcite .",
    "overall , the 3-d sph simulations presented by @xcite showed that despite this very simple set up , accretion flows heated by even a relatively weak x - ray source ( i.e. , with the luminosity around 1% of the eddington luminosity ) can undergo a complex time evolution and can have a very complex structure .",
    "however , the exact nature and robustness of these new 3-d results has not been fully established .",
    "@xcite mentioned some numerical issues , in particular , artificial viscosity and relatively poor spacial resolution in sph , because of the usage of linear length scale ( as opposed to logarithmic grid in zeus - mp ) , limit ability to perform a stability analysis where one wishes to introduce perturbations to an initially smooth , time independent solution with well controlled amplitude and spatial distribution ( sph simulations have intrinsic limitations in realizing a smooth flow ) .",
    "therefore , the robustness and stability of the solutions found in the sph simulations are hard to access due to mixing of physical processes and numerical effects . here",
    ", we aim at clarifying the physics of these flows and measure the role of numerical effects in altering the effects of physical processes .",
    "our ultimate goal is to provide insights that could help to interpret observations of agn .",
    "we explore the conditions under which the two phase , hot and cold , medium near an agn can form and exist .",
    "such two phase accretion flows can be a hint to explain the modes of accretion observed in galactic nuclei , but also to explain the formation of broad and narrow lines which define agn . we also measure the so - called covering and filling factors and other quantities in our simulations in order to relate the simulation to the origin of the broad and narrow line regions ( blrs and nlrs , respectively ) .",
    "the connection of this work to the galaxy evolution and cosmology is that we resolve lower spatial scales , and hence can probe what physical processes affect the accretion flow . in our models",
    ", we can directly observe where the hot phase of accretion turns into a cold one or where an eventual outflow is launched . in most of the current simulations of galaxies ( e.g. @xcite and references therein )",
    "these processes are assumed or modeled by simple , so called sub - resolution , approximations because , contrary to our simulations , the resolution is too low to capture the flow properties on adequately small scales .",

    "the heating / cooling function contains four terms which are : ( 1 ) compton heating / cooling ( @xmath18 ) , ( 2 ) heating and cooling due to photoionization and recombination ( @xmath19 ) , ( 3 ) free - free transitions cooling ( @xmath20 ) and ( 4 ) cooling via line emission ( @xmath21 ) and it is given by ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath22}\\label{eq : hc_full}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the radiative temperature of x - rays and @xmath28 is the temperature of gas .",

    "the computational domain in these units ranges from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 pc ) .",

    "the procedure is adopted in order to increase the luminosity in a gradual manner rather than sudden .   from @xmath51 in order to avoid introducing additional parameters into the equations .",
    "while coupling these quantities not only a radiative efficiency of gravitational to radiative energy has to be assumed but one also needs to know how to calculate the mass accretion rate at the very compact region way below @xmath52 .",
    "another reason for decoupling @xmath37 and @xmath51 is that we are interested in caring out a stability analysis and perturb a steady state solutions with all model parameters fixed . ] only for steady state solutions ( with assumption that the mass accretion rate is constant from @xmath48 to @xmath53 ) the efficiency of conversion of gravitational energy into radiation @xmath54 is related to @xmath49 as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a mass accretion rate in eddington units ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 is a reference efficiency ) and it is measured from the model data . in our steady state models , @xmath59 ,",

    "the convectivelly unstable gas buoyantly rises and , as found in this work , controls the later evolution of the two - phase medium and mass accretion rate . given a simple set up with minimum number of processes included , our models display the three major features needed to explain some of the agn observations : cold inflow , hot outflow and cold , dense clouds which occasionally escape , advected with the hot wind .",
    "we show that an accretion flow at late , non - linear stages , thus most relevant to observations , are dominated by buoyancy instability not ti .",
    "this suggests that the numerical resolution might not have to be as high as that needed to capture the small scale ti modes and it is sufficient to capture significantly larger and slower buoyancy modes .",
    "we plan to check the consistency of the models with the observations by calculating the synthetic spectra , including emission and absorption lines based on our simulation following an approach like the one in @xcite . here , we only briefly comment on the main outflow properties and compare them some observations of outflows in seyfert galaxies .",

    "the velocities typically reach up to about 1000 km / s and a turnover radius is on one hundred to a few hundred parsec scales .",
    "to compare our results with the observations , figure  [ fig : vr_scatter ] shows the radial velocity of hot and cold gas versus the radius at t=11.8  myr for model 2d512x128d ( the data correspond to a snapshot shown in the right panels in figure  [ fig : st2d ] ) .",
    "we reiterate that our model is quite simplified ( e.g. , no gas rotation ) and the outer radius is relatively small ( i.e. , 200  pc ) .",
    "therefore , our comparison is only illustrative .",
    "we find that the hot outflow originates at around 10 pc and accelerates up to about @xmath105 , which is comparable to the escape velocity from 10  pc , @xmath106 . at larger distances , r = 100 - 200  pc ,",
    "we see a signature of deceleration which is consistent with the observations of seyferts outflows .",
    "we note that the geometry of the simulated flow is affected by our treatment of the boundaries of the computational domain , specifically along the pole and the equator we use reflection boundary conditions ( see   [ sec : num_setup ] ) .",
    "the scatter plot also indicates that the cold clouds appear at about 20 - 80 pc .",
    "their maximum velocity is about @xmath107 km / s , which is smaller than the velocity of the hot outflow . the plot does not show a clear indication of a linear acceleration of the outflowing cold gas .",
    "however , it is possible that the cold clouds , seen in this snapshot , will continue to be dragged by the hot outflow and eventually will reach higher velocities .",
    "we also measured the column density of the hot and cold gas for the same , representative , snapshot at t=11.8 myrs .",
    "the typical column densities vary with the observer inclination , @xmath108 for gas @xmath109 k , and @xmath110 for gas with @xmath111 k. this is roughly consistent with column densities estimated from observations of agn ( e.g. for ngc 1068 @xmath112 , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our results are similar in many respects , to the previous findings presented in @xcite , i.e. the accretion evolution depends on @xmath49 luminosity ; we also observe clouds , filaments and outflow .",

    "our work is on one hand a simplified and on the other hand an extended version of these previous works .",
    "the key extention here is that our new results cover the non - linear phase of the evolution .",
    "there are two new conclusions added by our analysis to the previous investigations .",
    "the 2-d models with outflows are possibly governed by other than ti instabilities mainly convection .",
    "another non - linear effects found in our 1-d and 2-d models is that the fragmentation of the flow makes it optically thick for photoionization",
    ". further investigation of shadowing effects is required .    some sub - resolution models of agn feedback in galaxy formation ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) assume that bh accretion is dominated by an unresolved cold phase , in order to boost up the accretion rate obtained in simulations .",
    "our results indicate that the cold phase accretion is unlikely dominant as even in well - developed and well- resolved multi - phase cases , the accretion is typically dominated by a hot phase .",
    "however , we note that the cold phase of our solution might be an upper branch of some more complicated multi - phase medium ( i.e. , a mixture of molecular , atomic and dusty gas ) .",
    "this work was intentionally focused on a very limited number of processes and effects .",
    "its results suggest that the future work should include more self - consistent approach not only with shadowing effects but also with the radiation force .",
    "our next step would be to investigate the non - axisymmetric effects via fully 3-d simulations .",

    "vertical line means that the derivative is taken under constant thermodynamical variable condition .",
    "dispersion equation  [ eq : cube ] has three roots . in a short wavelength regime ( @xmath127 ) , two , complex roots correspond to two conjunct nearly adiabatic sound waves and third , real one is an isobaric condensation mode ( the gas density and temperature change in anti - phase so that the pressure remains constant ) .",
    "the sign of the real part of the root gives the stability criterion .",
    "the sound wave will grow if @xmath128 ( known as parker s criterion , @xcite ) .",
