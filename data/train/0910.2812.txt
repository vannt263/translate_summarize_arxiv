    "the system was observed during 5 nights from october 2008 to january 2009 at the athens university observatory , using a 40-cm cassegrain telescope equipped with the ccd camera st-8xmei and b , v , r , i bessell filters .",
    "the light curves ( hereafter lcs ) were analysed with the @xmath0 software @xcite which uses the 2003 version of the wd code @xcite . due to the lack of spectroscopic mass ratio of the system ,",
    "the q - search method was applied in mode 2 , 4 and 5 in order to find the most probable value of the ( photometric ) mass ratio ( q ) .",
    "the least squares method with statistical weights has been used for the analysis of the o - c diagram .",
    "the current o - c diagram of x tri includes 572 times of minima taken from the literature .",
    "the following ephemeris : @xmath1 @xcite was used as the initial one for the o - c analysis of the compiled times of minima .",
    "the results of the lcs solution ( see figure 1 and table 1 ) show that x tri is a semi - detached system with the secondary star filling its roche lobe .",
    "the periodic variations of the orbital period of the system could be explained by adopting the existence of three additional components , which were found to have minimal masses 0.18 , 0.24 and 0.22 , respectively ( see figure 1 and table 2 ) .",
    "an extra light contribution to the luminosity of the eb was taken into account in the lcs solution but it was found to be less than 1% .",
    "such a small extra luminosity could be explained by the small values of the minimal masses of the possible additional components found",
    ". the steady decrease rate of its period is probably due to angular momentum loss , since the direction of the flow ( from the more massive to the less massive component ) , revealed from the o - c diagram analysis , comes in disagreement with the one derived from the lcs analysis ."
