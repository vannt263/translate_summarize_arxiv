    "will be absorbed by choosing the normalizing length scale to be @xmath19 .",
    "let us now assume that our total fields are composed of some ambient seed fields and fluctuations about them , b = h+b_0 + , v = u+v_0 + where @xmath20 are the equilibrium fields and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are , respectively , the macroscopic and microscopic fluctuations .",
    "notice that our ambient fields are allowed to have a component at a microscopic scale . for analytical work , we choose for the ambient fields a special class of equilibrium solutions to eqs .",
    "( 1 - 2 ) .",
    "these solutions , also known as the double beltrami ( db ) pair @xcite , come into existence because of the interaction of flows and fields ; the hall term is essential for their formation .",
    "the db configurations are known to be robust and accessible , through a variational principle , for a variety of conditions including inhomogeneous densities .",
    "non constant density cases do display many interesting phenomena @xcite , but the dynamo and reverse dynamo actions can be very adequately described by the analytically tractable constant density system .",
    "we shall , therefore , choose the following db pair ( obeying the concomitant bernoulli condition @xmath23 @xcite ) + b_0=v_0,b_0+v_0=dv_0 , as a representative ambient state .",
    "the general solution is expressible in terms of the single beltrami fields  @xmath24 that satisfies @xmath25 : b_0&=&c_+g_+(_+)+c_-g_-(_- ) , + v_0&=&(a^-1+_+)c_+g_+(_+)+(a^-1+_-)c_-g_-(_- ) . here",

    "our primary interest is the creation of macro fields from the ambient micro fields .",
    "some what later we will assume , for simplicity , that our zeroth order fields are wholly at the microscopic scale .",
    "this allows us to create a hierarchy in the micro fields , the ambient fields are much greater than the fluctuations at the same scale  ( @xmath37 denote the spatial averages and @xmath38 .",
    "this set of equations can be regarded as a closure model of the hall ",
    "mhd equations , which are now general in two respects : 1 ) it is a closure of the full set of equations , since the feedback of the micro  scale",
    "is consistently included in the evolution of both @xmath39 and @xmath40 ; 2 ) the role of the hall current ( especially in the dynamics of the micro ",
    "scale ) is also properly accounted for ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "we now choose the constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 so that the two beltrami scales become vastly separated ( since these constants reflect the values of the invariant helicities , it is through @xmath27 and @xmath28 that the helicities control the final results ) . in the astrophysically relevant regime of disparate scales (",
    "the size of the structure is much greater than the ion skin depth ) , we shall deal with two extreme cases : ( i )  @xmath41 ,  @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , and ( ii )  @xmath44 ,  @xmath45 ) . at this time , we would like to draw the reader s attention to the origin of scale separation in the original equilibrium system  it is the hall term that imposes the micro scale ( ion skin  depth ) on the macroscopic mhd equilibrium .",
    "consistent with the main objectives of this paper , we will now assume that the original equilibrium is predominantly micro  scale ( condition applicable for many astrophysical systems ) , i.e , the basic reservoir from which we will generate macro scale fields is , indeed , at a totally different scale .",
    "neglecting the macro scale component altogether , the assumed equilibria becomes simpler with the velocity and magnetic fields linearly related as v_0&=&b_0(+a^-1 ) + v_e0&=&v_0-b_0=b_0  a^-1 + & = & ( a^-1h - u)b_0 + & = & ( h-(+a^-1)u)b_0 .",
    "notice the preponderance of nonlinear terms in the evolution equations for @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "one would expect that these terms will certainly play a very important part in the eventual saturation of the macroscopic fields , but in the early acceleration stage when the ambient short scale energy is much greater than the newly created macroscopic energy , these terms will not be significant . deferring the fully nonlinear to a later stage , we shall limit ourselves to a `` linear  treatment here . neglecting the nonlinear terms and manipulating the system of equations , we readily derive ( after ' ' solving \" for and eliminating the short scale fluctuating fields ) & & ( 1-a-1a^2 ) , + & & + & & - . where the spatial averages are yet to be performed .",
    "we use the standard isotropic abc solution of the single beltrami system , b_0x = b_03 , + b_0y = b_03 , + b_0z = b_03 . to compute the spatial averages . after some tedious but straightforward algebra , we arrive at the final acceleration equations & = & 2b^2_03 & = & -b^2_03(1-a-1a^2)h . where  @xmath48  measures the ambient micro scale magnetic energy ( also the kinetic energy because of ( 11 ) ) .",
    "the coefficients in these equations are determined by @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "we see that , to leading order , @xmath47 evolves independently of @xmath46 but the reverse is not true : the evolution of @xmath46 does require knowledge of @xmath47 .    in the dynamo context , the hall  currents in the micro ",
    "scale are known to modify the @xmath50 coefficient so that it survives the standard cancellation of the kinetic and magnetic contributions for alfvnic perturbations @xcite .",
    "it is also known that , depending on the state of the system , the hall effect ( by replacing the bulk kinetic helicity by the electron flow helicity ) can cause large enhancement or suppression of the dynamo action as compared to the standard mhd @xcite .",
    "writing ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) as = -r(h),= , where r = b^2_03(1- a^-1-a^-2 )  , s = b^2_06[(+a^-1)^2 - 1 ]  , q=^2b^2_06  , and fourier analyzing , one obtains -^2h",
    "=- ir(kh )  , -^2u = ik(su - qh ) . yielding the growth rate , ^4=r^2k^2  , ^2=-|r|(k )  ,",
    "at which @xmath47 and @xmath46 increase .",
    "the growing macro fields are related to one another by u = qs+r  h.    we shall now show how a choice of @xmath27 and @xmath28 fixes the relative amounts of microscopic energy in the ambient fields and consequently in the nascent macroscopic fields @xmath46 or @xmath47 . we persist with our two extreme cases :    \\(i ) for @xmath51  , the inverse micro scale @xmath52 implying  @xmath53 , i.e , the ambient micro ",
    "scales fields are primarily kinetic . these type of conditions may be met in stellar photospheres , where the turbulent velocity field at some stage can be dominant although some @xmath54  is present as well .",
    "for these parameters , it can be easily seen that the generated macro  fields have precisely the opposite ordering ,  @xmath55 .",
    "this is an example of the straight dynamo mechanism .",
    "micro scale fields with kinetic dominance create , preferentially , macro scale fields that are magnetically dominant  super  alfvnic `` turbulent flows '' lead to steady flows that are equally sub  alfvnic ( remember we are using alfvnic units ) .",
    "it is extremely important , however , to emphasize that the dynamo effect ( dominant in this regime ) must always be accompanied by the generation of macro  scale plasma flows .",
    "this realization can have serious consequences for defining the initial setup for the later dynamics in the stellar atmosphere .",
    "the presence of an initial macro  scale velocity field during the flux emergence processes is , for instance , always guaranteed by the mechanism exposed above .",
    "the implication is that all models of chromosphere heating / particle acceleration should take into account the existence of macro  scale primary plasma flows ( even weak ) and their self  consistent coupling ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "\\(ii ) for @xmath56 the inverse micro scale  @xmath57 . consequently  @xmath58 , and the ambient energy is mostly magnetic . these conditions might pertain in certain domains in the photospheres or chromospheres , where the turbulent velocity field may exist , but the turbulent magnetic field is the dominant component .",
    "this micro ",
    "scale magnetically dominant initial system creates macro  scale fields  @xmath59 that are kinetically abundant .",
    "the situation has fully reversed from the one discussed in the previous example  starting from a strongly sub  alfvnic turbulent flow , the system generates a strongly super  alfvnic macro  scale flow ; this mode of conversion could be called the `` reverse dynamo '' mechanism . in the region of a given astrophysical system where the fluctuating / turbulent magnetic field is initially dominant",
    ", the magneto  fluid coupling induces efficient / significant acceleration and part of the magnetic energy will be transferred to steady plasma flows .",
    "the eventual product of the `` reverse dynamo '' mechanism is a steady super ",
    "alfvnic flow  a macro flow accompanied by a weak magnetic field ( compare with @xcite for a magnetically driven dynamo . in this study magnetic field growth on much larger scales , and significant velocity fluctuations with finite volume averaged kinetic helicity are found ) .",
    "it is tempting to stipulate that `` reverse dynamo '' may be the explanation for the observations that fast flows are generally found in weak field regions of the solar atmosphere @xcite .    this simple analysis has led to , what we believe ,",
    "are several far - reaching results : ( 1 ) the dynamo and `` reverse dynamo '' mechanisms have the same origin  they are manifestation of the magneto  fluid coupling ; ( 2 ) the proportionality of @xmath46 and @xmath47 implies that they must be present simultaneously , and the greater the macro  scale magnetic field ( generated locally ) , the greater the macro  scale velocity field ( generated locally ) ; ( 3 ) the growth rate of the macro  scale fields is defined by db parameters ( hence , by the ambient magnetic and generalized helicities ) and scales directly with the ambient turbulent energy @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the larger the initial turbulent ( microscopic ) magnetic energy , the stronger the acceleration of the flow .",
    "we believe that these novel results will surely help in advancing our understanding of the evolution of large  scale magnetic fields and their opening up with respect to the fast particle escape from the stellar coronae .",
    "this effect may also have important impact on the dynamical and continuous kinetic energy supply of plasma flows observed in various astrophysical systems .",
    "we would add here that in this study both the initial and final states have finite heliciies ( magnetic and kinetic ) .",
    "the helicity densities are dynamical parameters that evolve self ",
    "consistently during the process of flow generation .",
    "it is also important to notice that the end product of the reverse dynamo action is a macroscopic flow ( produced from a microscopic helical magnetic field ) while for `` inverse dynamo '' @xcite it is still the macroscopic magnetic field but produced from a velocity field with helicity .",
    "we end the analytical section by a remark on the nonlinear terms in eqs .",
    "( 7,10 ) that do not appear later .",
    "it is amazing that the linear solution given in eqs .",
    "( 22 - 24 ) makes the nonlinear terms strictly zero .",
    "thus the solution discussed in the last section is an exact ( a special class ) solution of the nonlinear system and thus remains valid even as @xmath40 and @xmath39 grow to larger amplitudes .",
    "this interesting but peculiar property that a basically linear solution solves the nonlinear problem pertains to both mhd and hmhd . in mhd , for example",
    ", it manifests itself as walen s nonlinear alfven wave @xcite while in hmhd it is revealed through the recently discovered solution of @xcite .",
    "in order to strengthen and support the conclusions of the simple analytical model , we now present some representative results from our 2.5 d numerical simulation of the general two - fluid equations in cartesian geometry @xcite . for a description of the code",
    ", the reference @xcite should also be consulted .",
    "the simulation system is somewhat different because of the existence of an ambient embedding macroscopic field .",
    "we find that , when such a field is present , the basic qualitatively features of the dynamo and reverse dynamo mechanisms do not change much but the algebra is considerably more complicated and will be presented in a longer paper later .",
    "the simulation system contains several effects not included in the analysis ; it has , for instance , dissipation and heat flux in addition to the vorticity and the hall terms.the plasma is taken to be compressible and embedded in a gravitational field ; this provides an extra possibility for micro  scale structure creation .",
    "transport coefficients for heat conduction and viscosity are taken from @xcite .",
    "the simulation presented here deals with the trapping and amplification of a primary flow impinging on a single closed  line structure .",
    "the choice of initial conditions is guided by the observational evidence @xcite of the self  consistent process of acceleration and trapping / heating of plasma particles in the finely structured solar atmosphere .",
    "the simulation begins with a weak symmetric up ",
    "flow ( initially gaussian ,  @xmath61  upper plot of fig.1 for the vector potential ( flux function ) defining the 2d arcade ) .",
    "this field was assumed to be initially uniform in time .",
    "the magnetic field is represented as :  @xmath62   with  @xmath63 . from numerous runs on the flow ",
    "field evolution , we have chosen to display the results corresponding to the following initial and boundary flow parameters :  @xmath64 .  the background plasma density is @xmath65 .  in simulations",
    "@xmath66 is an exponentially decreasing function of @xmath67 .",
    "experience was a guide to for imposing the following boundary condition , @xmath68  which was used with sufficiently high accuracy for all parameters  @xmath69 .",
    "the initial velocity field has a pulse  like distribution ( middle and lower plots of fig.1 ) with a time duration @xmath70 .",
    "it is found that : + ( 1 ) the acceleration is significant in the vicinity of the magnetic field  maximum ( originally present or newly created during the evolution ) with strong deformation of field lines and energy re  distribution due to magneto  fluid coupling and dissipative effects .",
    "+ * ( 2 ) * initially , a part of the flow is trapped in the maximum field localization area , accumulated , cooled and accelerated ( plots corresponding to @xmath71 in fig.2 ) .",
    "the accelerated flow reaches speeds greater than @xmath72km / s in less than @xmath72s ( in agreement with recent observations @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ ( 3 ) after this stage the flow passes through a series of quasi  equilibria . in this relatively extended era ( @xmath73 ) of stochastic / oscilating acceleration ,",
    "the intermittent flows continuously acquire energy ( see fig.3 for the flow kinetic and magnetic energy maxima and also fig.2 results at @xmath74 ) .",
    "+ ( 4 ) the flow starts to accelerate again ( fig.3(a - c ) for the velocity field evolution ) .",
    "this process is completely consistent with the analytical prediction ; the acceleration is highest in the strong field regions ( newly generated , fig.2 ) . at this moment",
    "the accelerated daughter flows ( macro  scale ) are decoupled from the mother flow carrying currents and modifying the initial arcade field creating new @xmath75 localization areas that span the region between @xmath76 and @xmath77 from the interaction surface .",
    "the extensive simulation runs also show that when dissipation is present , the hall term ( proportion to  @xmath78 ) , through the mediation of micro  scale physics , plays a crucial role in the acceleration / heating processes . the existence of initial fast acceleration in the region of maximum localization of the original magnetic field , and the creation of new areas of macro  scale magnetic field localization ( fig.2 , panel for @xmath79 ) with simultaneous transfer of the magnetic energy ( oscillatory , micro  scale ) to flow kinetic energy ( fig.2 , panel for @xmath80 and fig.3 results ) are manifestations of the combined effects of the dynamo and reverse dynamo phenomena .",
    "the maintenance of quasi  steady flows for rather significant period is also an effect of the continuous energy supply from fluctuations ( due to the dissipative , hall and vorticity effects ) .",
    "these flows are likely to provide a very important input element for understanding the finely structured atmospheres with their richness of dynamical structures as well as for the mechanisms of heating , and possible escape of plasmas .",
    "notice , that in the simulation the actual magnetic and generalized helicity densities are dynamical parameters .",
    "thus even if they are not in the required range initially , their evolution could bring them in the range where they could satisfy conditions needed to efficiently generate flows .",
    "the required conditions could be met at several stages .",
    "this could , perhaps , explain the existence of several phases of acceleration .",
    "dissipation effects could play a fundamental role in setting up these distinct stages ; it could , for example , modify the generalized vorticity that will finally lead to a modification of field lines and even to the creation of micro scales ( shocks or fast fluctuations ) .",
    "from an analysis of the two  fluid equations , we have extracted , in this paper , the `` reverse  dynamo '' mechanism  the amplification / generation of fast plasma flows in astrophysical systems with initial turbulent ( micro scale ) magnetic fields . this process is simultaneous with , and complimentary to the highly explored dynamo mechanism .",
    "it is found ( both analytically and numerically ) that the generation of macro  scale flows is an essential consequence of the magneto  fluid coupling , and is independent of the initial and boundary conditions .",
    "the generation of macro scale magnetic fields and flows goes hand in hand ; the greater the macro  scale magnetic field ( generated locally ) the greater the macro  scale velocity field ( generated locally ) .",
    "the acceleration due to the reverse dynamo is directly proportional to the initial turbulent magnetic energy . when the microscopic magnetic field is initially dominant , a major part of its energy transforms to macro  scale flow energy ; a weak macro  scale magnetic field is generated along with .",
