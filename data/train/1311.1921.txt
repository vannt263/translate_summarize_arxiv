    "galaxy clusters are high density regions in the universe where we can test our knowledge of the physical processes governing galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "massive galaxy clusters in particular contain a diffuse luminous component consisting of stars which are out of galaxy halos in the intracluster environment .",
    "this intracluster light or icl was first detected by @xcite and today we know that the icl is an important component of the total stellar luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the first identification of the icl was connected with the measure of very extended halos in the intensity profiles of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) , in excess with respect to the de vaucouleurs ( @xmath2 ) intensity profile for elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "estimates of the fraction of cluster light contained in the icl in nearby clusters range from few % up to 50% depending on the cluster mass and redshift , where the highest value has been estimated in the coma cluster @xcite .",
    "several models have been suggested to explain the origin of intracluster stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although various processes might contribute to some of the observed icl it is widely accepted that stars in the external regions of galaxy halos are pushed into the intracluster environment by tidal stripping due to galaxy interactions ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recent n - body results @xcite predict that the icl should contain a significant fraction ( @xmath3% ) of the total stellar mass in clusters , in broad agreement with observations .",
    "thus , the study of the icl distribution in clusters can provide important information on the dynamical properties of the clusters and on their dark matter ( dm ) density profiles .",
    "different techniques have been adopted to measure the icl in galaxy clusters since its definition is not unambiguous among observers . moreover ,",
    "different icl classifications adopt different assumptions about the distribution of luminosity in galaxy halos .",
    "this results in different estimates of the intensity distribution of the icl in the cluster cores , as stated by @xcite .",
    "indeed , some authors have measured the icl below a given surface brightness threshold ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "other authors have measured the icl as an excess found in their model fits to galaxy halos ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because the study of icl requires very deep , time - consuming observations",
    ", it is difficult to analyze the icl distribution in different galaxy clusters within a single observational program ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    to this end",
    "we began a long - term imaging program devoted to the analysis of the icl in clusters of different physical properties at intermediate redshift .",
    "wide field images are being obtained with the large binocular camera ( lbc , @xcite ) , a prime focus camera at the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) .",
    "lbc is an ideal imager for this kind of study .",
    "its high sensitivity due to the prime focus position at an 8 m class telescope like lbt and its relatively wide field of view which allows a controlled background subtraction using regions far away from the cluster , provide an unique opportunity for the icl detection .",
    "we began the program with the well known massive cluster cl0024 + 17 at @xmath4 where an overwhelming amount of data and theoretical work are available in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a first detection of icl for this cluster has been shown by @xcite who determined the icl fraction with respect to the total light to be @xmath5% within the 100 kpc region .",
    "@xcite has recently studied the icl profile in this cluster , masking the core region and focusing the analysis on the external region @xmath6 mpc looking for icl signature of an external dm ring he claimed to be present from weak lensing analysis .    in the present paper",
    "we follow a different approach trying to remove the galaxy halo contribution with detailed profile fitting to derive an accurate icl profile in the core region down to the bcg position and comparing this with simple theoretical predictions .    in the following analysis",
    "all magnitudes are in the ab systems and all physical parameters have been computed adopting the standard @xmath7cdm model with @xmath8 , @xmath9 , baryonic density @xmath10 and hubble constant @xmath11 in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "the data set was obtained with lbc at the lbt on mount graham in arizona .",
    "lbc is a binocular camera installed at the prime focus of each of the two 8.4 m telescopes .",
    "each camera has an unvignetted field of view of 23@xmath12 23 arcmin@xmath13 with a sampling of 0.226 arcsec / pixel .",
    "lbc - blue is optimized in the uv - b band and lbc - red is optimized for the vriz bands .",
    "the r - band image used for the present analysis has been obtained from frames in the lbc - red sloan filter taken in 2011 november and 2012 january in photometric or clear sky conditions .",
    "the typical exposure time per frame was 120 s ( which provided 4000 adu per pixel with a gain of 2@xmath14 and a saturation for stars brighter than r=18.1 mag ) and the final image is the coadding of several frames for a total of 2.73 hr of exposure time in an area which includes the core of the cl0024 + 17 cluster in a single chip , avoiding the analysis of inhomogeneities among different chips in the lbc field of view .",
    "the image has been calibrated using a zeropoint derived from sloan r magnitudes of a set of sloan digital sky survey stars present in the field .",
    "we have verified that the lbc - red sloan r filter is very similar to the sloan one and that any dependence on the ( r - i)@xmath15 color is negligible .",
    "the rms uncertainty in the zeropoint is @xmath16 mag .",
    "the first step consisted of producing a coadded image of individual frames .",
    "the data were initially reduced using the lbc pipeline for imaging data : bias - subtraction , sky flat - fielding , and astrometric correction @xcite .",
    "specifically , we have applied skyflats ( twilight flats ) from blank field images taken the same night or the night just before , for the two runs of november @xmath17 and january 20 where the cluster data have been acquired .",
    "we have also applied superflats derived from different science images of deep , relatively empty fields , after removing all the detected objects down to the faintest limits allowed by the noise level . as emphasized in the analysis of gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , changes in flat fields can affect the measure of any diffuse light along the chips .",
    "for this reason we have quantified the stability of the flat fields measuring the difference among various superflats and skyflats .",
    "superflats changed from 2011 november to 2012 march by up to 0.3% but the flat accuracy remained confined at 0.06% level since the adopted superflats have been computed using data within one to two days from the target observations .",
    "this accuracy would allow us to probe surface brightnesses 8.0 mag deeper than the sky level ( r=21.1 mag arcsec@xmath18 ) , corresponding to r=29.1 mag arcsec@xmath18 .",
    "the same check has been applied to skyflats measuring the difference between skyflats obtained in two consecutive nights . in this case , since we are interested in variations on scales of tens of arcsec which could affect the selection of icl subregions , we have smoothed the frame with a gaussian filter with a @xmath19=2 arcsec to reduce the pixel to pixel noise level .",
    "the resulting difference is of the order of 0.05% on a region of @xmath20 arcmin@xmath13 around the cluster position . in figure 1",
    "we have shown the stability of the superflat of the chip used for the cluster observations .",
    "the two superflats were obtained in two consecutive nights near the second cluster observing run .",
    "the superflat ratio in figure 1(c ) shows no specific spatial features .",
    "time variation of the superflat on a day by day scale is thus confined on a spatial scale much smaller than the cluster angular size .",
    "the flat uncertainty is taken into account in the icl estimate and shown as a horizontal threshold in the plot of the icl profile shown in section 3 .",
    "the final coadded image has been obtained after equalization of each individual frame to the same value estimated in a region with poor contamination by faint sources .",
    "the resulting quality of the image corresponds to a resolution of fwhm@xmath21 arcsec .",
    "the lbc pipeline also produces an rms map for each scientific image , directly from the raw science frame , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "these rms maps are used for the subsequent photometric analysis of the galaxies in the cluster .",
    "the second step consisted of the objects detecting and masking .",
    "we ran source extractor ( sextractor,@xcite ) to the coadded r - band image to create a source catalog .",
    "concerning the scattered light from bright stars , this is an additive light which is often removed after careful fitting of the point - spread function ( psf ) wings in bright saturated stellar images , as was done in , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in measuring the icl in the central core of the cluster ( @xmath22 arcmin@xmath13 ) , here we have followed a different equivalent approach .",
    "after a first background estimate finalized to the selection of sources down to r=27 mag , we have masked all the sources including the overall @xmath23 arcmin@xmath13 cluster region shown in our figure 2 .",
    "we optimized parameters for source extraction of the faintest objects with a very low sky-@xmath19 threshold .",
    "the galaxy detection was established at 2@xmath19 level in an area within the fwhm .",
    "this provided a first temporary catalog of galaxies detected down to @xmath24 and a sextractor segmentation map used for subsequent object masking of the image .",
    "then we have estimated the background map using the sextractor package .",
    "the choice of the mesh size ( backsize ) is of course important .",
    "if it is too small , the background estimation is affected by the presence of objects .",
    "most importantly , the flux of the external regions of extended objects can be included in the background map .",
    "if the mesh size is too large , it can not reproduce the small scale variations of the background . for this reason we have first used a backsize=256 pixel",
    "( lbc scale is 0.226\" / pixel ) for object selection and masking , then we have used the much smaller value of backsize=32 pixel to absorb the extended wings of the bright saturated stars .",
    "since the two nearest brightest stars are at about 2.4 ( the brightest ) and 1.4 arcmin from the south edge of the cluster core shown in figure 2 , the backsize value adopted guarantees that in the midway , where we assume there is no detectable icl , the background in empty regions is 0 within the rms noise level . in figure 3",
    "we show the enlarged background - subtracted image around the cluster core with the two saturated bright stars .",
    "we have tested that the results do not depend on the backsize value unless we use values @xmath25 pixels . in the latter case a coarse sampling of the background map ( e.g. @xmath26 mesh )",
    "introduce stellar halo contamination in the background estimate .",
    "we show in figure 3 an empty encircled region where the pixel intensity histogram has been computed .",
    "its intensity distribution shown in figure 4 suggests that we have removed any significant contribution from bright stellar halos in the cluster core .",
    "the background in the masked cluster region is finally interpolated from the neighborhood region .",
    "the background - subtracted image has a 1@xmath19 sky surface brightness limit of @xmath27 mag arcsec@xmath18 estimated as in boutsia et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "we conservatively take into account any systematic error in the next icl estimate due to the adopted background subtraction procedure producing different background - subtracted images .",
    "we adopt background maps with different backsize values ( from 24 to 256 pixels ) , ensuring that any residual background surface brightness in the selected regions was smaller than its rms value .",
    "these scatters in the background maps were taken into account when estimating error bars associated with the evaluation of the icl profile described in the next section .",
    "the resulting background - subtracted area around the cl0024 + 17 cluster core is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the presence of a diffuse ( green in the online journal ) emission is clearly visible in the image .",
    "the diffuse emission surrounds the brightest galaxies extending outside their halos and including fainter and smaller dwarf galaxies .",
    "sharp edges are clearly visible in the external region of the cluster core outside about 50 arcsec from the bcg .",
    "to evaluate the measure of diffuse emission in the cluster core , we need to remove the galaxy halo contamination .",
    "previous evaluations on the same cluster by @xcite were mainly focused on external regions up to @xmath28 mpc to probe the possible presence of an external dm ring which has then been questioned by subsequent lensing analysis @xcite . for this reason , almost all of the central cluster core",
    "was masked in the previous analysis .",
    "here we follow an opposite approach , trying to remove the galaxy halo contribution by detailed profile fitting of the galaxies present in the cluster core , both cluster members or foreground and background / lensed .",
    "we applied the galfit package @xcite for profile fitting all the galaxies found by sextractor down to @xmath24 in the cluster core ( @xmath29 kpc from the bcg ) .",
    "galfit is one of the most accurate softwares , allowing us to fit the galaxy profiles of ellipticals , spirals , as well as irregular galaxies adopting parametric functions like the srsic , moffat , king , ferrer , etc .",
    ", profiles .",
    "we used srsic power - law models which can mimic radial distributions of different galaxy types ranging from spirals to ellipticals .",
    "a psf estimated using relatively bright stars present near the cluster was convolved with the intrinsic profiles .",
    "when the power - law index @xmath30 is large , it has a steep inner profile and an extended outer wing . on the contrary , when @xmath30 is small , it has a shallow inner profile and a sharp drop at large radius .",
    "the traditional de vaucouleurs and exponential disk profiles are specific cases with @xmath31 or 1 , respectively .",
    "it is clear from figure 4 of @xcite that profile fitting with large ( @xmath32 ) power - law indices imply very extended halos which in our case can emulate the presence of any extended background around bright galaxies , for this reason best fits were considered acceptable for @xmath33 .",
    "the objects were fitted in groups as a tradeoff among different requirements .",
    "a relatively large area including more galaxies was required for a better estimation of the local diffuse background .",
    "the group should not be too large to allow the best sensitivity in the fit of the more numerous faint objects compared to the brighter ones . finally , the computer time needed for convergence is a further limiting parameter .",
    "we have first fitted the central region of the cluster core : the original , fitted and residual images are shown in figure 5(a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) .",
    "the region for the simultaneous galaxy fit was selected to sample the connected diffuse light on the basis of the isophotal connection limited to 27.4 mag arcsec@xmath18 .",
    "previous analyses by gonzalez et al .",
    "2005 tried to fit the external bcg halos of lower redshift , well relaxed clusters with a two - component de vaucouleurs profile ( instead of a single srsic profile , with an index often greater than 4 ) and identify the external component as being due to the icl contribution . to fit the external light we adopted a `` modified ferrer profile '' @xcite which consists of a central power - law shape followed by an external cutoff",
    "whose truncation sharpness can be tuned by a free parameter .",
    "in addition to the standard radial profiles , azimuthal shape functions like fourier and bending modes were used to add azimuthal perturbations to the radial profiles .",
    "these azimuthal functions were adopted specifically to account for lensed , distorted galaxy images or tidal tails , as well as to model the irregular shape of the observed diffuse light contours at various intensity levels .",
    "all the galaxies have been fitted with srsic profiles with resulting best fit values @xmath34 with the exception of the bright a , b , and c galaxies indicated in figure 5(a ) . for these galaxies",
    "a single component analysis gave index values up to @xmath35 and a significant ring appeared in the halo residuals together with a negative intensity hole in the center .",
    "although the fitting of the region shown in figure 5(a ) was still acceptable with a reduced @xmath36 , following gonzalez et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we included a second component in the fit which , with few more degrees of freedom , provided a significant reduction of the @xmath37 by about @xmath38 .",
    "the resulting fit gave @xmath33 for all the double components of the three mentioned galaxies and a small and uniform residual where holes and rings disappeared ( figure 5(c ) ) .",
    "the resulting best fit gave a reduced @xmath39 and the residual map shown in figure 5(c ) gave an average value@xmath40 adu and a noise rms@xmath41 .",
    "the best fit srsic values for the a , b , and c galaxies are shown in table 1 as an example .",
    "the best fitting modified ferrer profile values are : central brightness 24.3 , @xmath42 ( outer truncation sharpness ) , @xmath43 ( central slope ) , an axis ratio of 0.8 , an outer truncation radius of 231 arcsec , a position angle of 67 deg , bending coefficients 298.8,4406 , and @xmath44 , fourier terms f1 , f3 , f4 0.3 , @xmath45 , and 0.08 , respectively .",
    "the effects due to the bending modes and fourier terms can be seen in figure 5(b ) where the low - intensity profile ( green ) is curved toward the lower left corner with two main blobs on the left side .",
    "more external regions have been fitted in a similar way .",
    "this ensured that any residual halo intensity of each galaxy has been excluded from the icl analysis .    at the center of the cluster",
    "where the four brightest galaxy halos overlap , the icl measure mainly depends on the interpolation of the background shape estimated in the more external region .",
    "we emphasize that at the low resolutions of ground - based observations it is difficult to recover the true , intrinsic model parameters of the intensity profile in the galaxy cores .",
    "however , what is important for the estimate of the icl is the best fit of the galaxy profile which minimizes the residuals .",
    "the overall best - fit solution is shown in figure 6(a ) where the intensity distributions of all the fitted galaxies are shown .",
    "in the same figure 6(a ) it is possible to evaluate the contribution to the apparent diffuse light by the overlaps of the galaxy halos which is relevant around the cluster brightest galaxies .",
    "figure 6(b ) shows the image in figure 6(a ) subtracted from the original image , where the smoothed icl is shown as a residual to the galaxy profile fitting . on the basis of this procedure the icl shown in figure 6(b )",
    "could be considered as a lower limit if some physical radial truncations were present in the galaxy intensity profiles .",
    "the icl shows a main structure elongated in the direction northwest - southeast ( nw - se ) and a clear substructure in the southwest ( sw ) side of the image .",
    "the icl distribution extends at least up to 200 kpc ( the scale is @xmath46 kpc / arcsec ) from the barycenter located at r.a.=00 26 35.478 decl.=17 09 43.6 .",
    "the center is few arcsec from the x - ray ( r.a.=00 26 36.3 decl=17 09 46 ) and dm ( r.a.=00 26 33.37 decl.=17 09 41.68 , @xcite centers .    various aperture magnitudes with their associated errors were computed using the sextractor package .",
    "the resulting circular intensity profile is shown in figure 7 .",
    "it is interesting to note the resulting nearly exponential profile of the icl which extends up to 140 kpc .",
    "fitting a linear relation in the @xmath47 kpc region gives the best fit result shown in figure 7 : icl@xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 kpc . at 150 kpc",
    "a small bump is present that is associated with the sw substructure and the se elongation and at larger radii the profile appears to resume an exponential behavior .",
    "it is not obvious to find out such an exponential behavior from a region that is influenced by de vaucouleurs profiles of early - type galaxy halos .",
    "however in a cdm framework where the icl production is mainly due to stellar tidal stripping from galaxy halos , an exponential behavior is expected for the stellar mass lost by galaxy halos which is roughly proportional to the icl intensity in the red bands , as shown in the next section .",
    "error bars in figure 7 take into account possible systematic errors in the background subtraction as analyzed in section 2 .",
    "the horizontal line shows the level where uncertainties in the flat fielding procedure affect the icl measure .",
    "it is possible at this point to evaluate the intensity ratio profile of the icl , @xmath51 , defined as the ratio in circular apertures between icl and galaxy intensities .",
    "the ratio is shown in figure 8 in differential form after removal of galaxies whose available spectroscopic or photometric redshifts ( see e.g. @xcite ) are not compatible with the cluster membership .",
    "uncertainties in the evaluation of the cluster membership are small for @xmath52 since most of the galaxies in the cluster core ( figure 6(a ) ) have spectroscopic redshifts ( 33/43 ) and the remaining accurate photometric @xmath53 . for increasing magnitudes",
    ", the use of photometric redshifts with typical errors of 0.1 @xcite gradually increases the uncertainties in the cluster member assignment .",
    "for @xmath54 we assume all the galaxies in the cluster core as cluster members .",
    "since they are faint and small , any uncertainty in their membership fraction should change the estimate of the icl fraction by @xmath55% .",
    "the ratio profile in annular regions appears to increase as the radius decreases from 200 kpc down to @xmath56 kpc reaching a peak value of @xmath57% . at lower radii",
    "a bending followed by a decrease is present .",
    "the decrease is due to the presence of three among the bcgs whose extended halos overlap in the small central region .",
    "thus , any evidence of diffuse light in the cluster center relies on the extrapolation at @xmath58 kpc of the modeled background gradient behind the central galaxy profiles .",
    "the integrated fraction within @xmath59 kpc is @xmath60% .",
    "this integrated value is in between the first @xcite 15% estimate and the 35% value derived by @xcite .",
    "our integrated value is that expected on average by numerical simulations of cluster evolution in the cdm scenario from clusters of similar mass ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the differential icl profile , however , can give more detailed information on the shape of the cluster potential well , as outlined in the next section .",
    "here we show how basic quantities related to the shape of the cluster potential wells can be extracted from the observed radial dependence of the ratio @xmath51 in figure 8 .",
    "in fact , a straightforward , though simplified , analytical computation of the icl fraction @xmath61 can be worked out starting from the canonical expression ( see @xcite ) for the tidal radius of a satellite galaxy ( with initial mass @xmath62 , halocentric radius @xmath63 , and angular velocity @xmath64 ) in a potential @xmath65 : @xmath66    the above expression identifies the tidal radius with the distance to the saddle point in the potential interior to the satellites orbit , since this is the point at which the radial forces on a test particle cancel out ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we shall focus on the effect of the external potential on the stellar distribution of the orbiting galaxies ; note in our approach we deliberately neglect other processes which may be relevant for stripping , such as the cumulative effects of gravitational two - body interactions ( @xcite ; for an n - body investigation including galaxy harassment see @xcite ) , or pre - processing ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "our approach is to estimate whether the effect of the tidal field of the cluster gravitational potential is sufficient to explain the observed icl profile .",
    "an investigation of such effect on galaxy orbits and stripping has been performed by @xcite ; these authors , however , focussed on the detailed description of the possible orbital evolution of galaxies , but do not compute the effects on the statistical distribution of galaxies and icl for different profiles .",
    "previous computations investigating the tidal effects of the cluster potential ( starting from @xcite ) have been performed through n - body simulations ; in particular @xcite ) simulations were aimed at determining the effect of such process on the dwarf population of the fornax cluster , finding that such tidal effects may appreciably affect the stripping and the final properties of such dwarf galaxies . here",
    "we analytically compute - under simplified assumptions - the effect of the cluster tidal field on the stripping of stars for a generic gravitational potential , to investigate whether such process can account for our observational results .",
    "let us assume that satellite galaxies move on circular orbits ( we shall come back on this point later ) .",
    "we write the dark matter density profile of the cluster in the form @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a central density and @xmath69 is the distance from the cluster center in units of a scale radius @xmath70 ; for the standard @xcite profile , this is defined in terms of the viral radius @xmath71 and of the concentration parameter @xmath72 as @xmath73 .",
    "an analogous notation for the satellite yields for the satellite mass @xmath74 where @xmath75 , and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the effective boundary radius and the scale radius of the satellite galaxy , respectively . then equation ( 1 ) becomes    @xmath78    where we have defined an effective velocity dispersion in the cluster @xmath79 and similarly in the satellite galaxy ( in analogy with the isothermal case ) and    @xmath80^{3/2}\\over [ i(x)/x]^{1/2}\\,\\bigg [ [ 2\\,i(x)/x]+x\\,{d\\over dx } [ i(x)/x ] \\bigg]}\\bigg\\}^{1/3}~,\\ ] ]    where we have defined the function @xmath81 .",
    "details are shown in the appendix .",
    "note that in the isothermal case is @xmath82 , so that @xmath83 and equation ( 2 ) reduces to the expression @xmath84 . in this respect ,",
    "the function @xmath85 in equation ( 3 ) represents the deviation from the isothermal case .    to estimate the amount of stars lost by a satellite galaxy at a distance @xmath63 from the center ( in a circular orbit ) , we compute the stellar mass that lies beyond the tidal radius ( 5 ) , assuming an exponential form for the initial stellar mass distribution : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the disk exponential scale length and @xmath88 the central surface density .",
    "we now substitute expression ( 2 ) for @xmath89 in equation ( 4 ) obtaining @xmath90\\,exp{\\bigg[-{x\\,a(x)\\over \\lambda\\,c}}\\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath91 is the initial stellar mass of the satellite galaxy and @xmath92 is the spin parameter or equivalently the ratio between its scale length and its virial radius @xcite . for circular orbits ,",
    "the contribution to the intracluster stellar mass from all galaxies at a distance in the range @xmath93 from the cluster center can be obtained summing up the contribution of all galaxies orbiting at the radial distance @xmath94 from the cluster center , i.e. , @xmath95 where @xmath96 - for any given stellar mass - is the number density of galaxies between @xmath94 and @xmath97 , and @xmath98 is the average stellar mass before stripping . the analogous expression for the total initial stellar mass in galaxies before stripping",
    "is @xmath99 in particular , in the simplifying assumption of constant mass to light ratio , the ratio @xmath51 of intra - cluster to galactic light assumes a simple form @xmath100    in the context of our simple physical description of tidal stripping , the latter expression shows that the ratio @xmath51 is independent of the physical and statistical properties of the satellite population .",
    "thus the interesting result is that the ratio _ mainly depends on the gravitational profile of the cluster_. thus , the icl fraction can be used as a further probe of the large scale cluster physical properties .",
    "in fact , to compare with observations , equation ( 8) should be projected on the direction perpendicular to the line - of - sight as shown in the appendix ( equation ( a.7 ) ) .",
    "we remark that the above computation has been derived assuming circular orbits .",
    "however , the distribution of halo circularities in simulated clusters is peaked at values @xmath101 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , so that a more realistic computation can be performed assuming that - for any radial shell at a distance @xmath63 from the cluster center - galaxies oscillate within a distance @xmath102 from @xmath63 .",
    "in such a case we can perform a numerical computation adopting , for the angular velocity @xmath64 , the proper value at any point of the orbit , and assuming different values for @xmath102 so as to explore the possible circularities between 0.7 and 1 .",
    "the results from such a numerical computation are almost identical to those obtained analytically from equation ( 8) , which we then use to interpret the observational radial distribution @xmath51 .",
    "when compared to our observational results for @xmath51 ( section 3 ) , equation ( a.7 ) can be used to probe the shape of the cluster potential wells . in particular",
    ", we can probe the effect of assuming different forms for the function @xmath103 defining the shape of the density distribution @xmath104 .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "we chose different forms for @xmath103 and for the concentration parameter @xmath72 , which determines the function @xmath105 entering the icl ratio @xmath61 given in equations 8 and a.7 through the expression in equation ( 3 ) .",
    "this is compared to the observed radial dependence of the icl ratio determined in section 3 , to estimate which of the input forms for @xmath103 provides the best match to the observed run .",
    "we focus on the cored isothermal form @xmath106 , and on the @xcite form @xmath107 , and we always assume a fixed canonical value for the spin parameter @xmath108 . we take for the virial radius of the cluster the observed value @xmath109 mpc ; for fixed virial radius , the radial coordinate @xmath110 depends on the concentration parameter @xmath72 for which we explore different values for each of our assumed form of @xmath103 .",
    "the results of the comparison are shown in figure 8 for both the isothermal and nfw profiles .",
    "the best agreement is obtained for a nfw profile with @xmath111 ; interestingly , this is very close to the value @xmath112 obtained from the combined strong - weak lensing analysis by @xcite .",
    "note that we do not attempt to fit the inner region of the @xmath113 ; the observed turning down of the profile is affected by the accretion effect of the central galaxy which is by no means included in our analytical computation .",
    "finally , in our computation we have also assumed the satellite galaxies to have the same density profile of the galaxy cluster , i.e. @xmath114 , which is reasonable for this specific cluster .",
    "however , we have checked that - in the @xcite case - adopting a difference @xmath115 yields only minor changes to the results obtained assuming the same density profile ( in fact , we can recast its effect in terms of a normalization of @xmath116 in equation ( 3 ) differing by less than 5% from our reference cases ) .",
    "nevertheless , the remarkable agreement found between the icl fitting technique described above and the measurements from weak lensing shows that , despite the approximations adopted in our analytical computation , the radial dependence of the icl distribution can constitute a complementary probe for the shape of the clusters potential wells .",
    "if the spread of icl in the cluster core is due to the diffusion of unbound stars stripped from the halos of satellite galaxies , the resulting stellar mass loss is expected to alter the luminosity of cluster galaxies .",
    "a sign of this effect should be found in the shape of the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) in the cluster core .",
    "for this reason we built binned number counts for all the fitted galaxies which have then been removed for the icl measure .",
    "the number counts are shown in figure 9 and appear 50% complete down to @xmath117 .",
    "for this reason we limited the statistical analysis to @xmath118 .",
    "we derived absolute magnitudes adopting the appropriate redshift and @xmath119corrections estimated from @xcite for e - sab galaxies .",
    "we fitted a schechter function to the observed counts which have the same shape of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "this assumption implies that all the galaxies shown in the counts are at the same cluster redshift .",
    "this is justified by the fact that in order to compute the icl fraction with respect to the total galaxy light we have already removed from the catalog the foreground / background galaxies selected on the basis of their colors and spectroscopic redshifts , where available .",
    "however it is well known that the schechter function generally underestimates the abundance of very bright galaxies ( @xmath120 ) , which is mainly due to the presence of the bcgs ( e.g @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason we fitted them with a second schechter component .",
    "for the scope of the present work , we applied a simple @xmath37 fitting to the data points shown in figure 9 .",
    "we adopted the sum of two schechter functions .",
    "the best fit values found are @xmath121 and @xmath122 for the bcgs component and @xmath123 , @xmath124 for the main component .",
    "we emphasize that the atypical best fit values of the former component have been obtained , forcing a schechter shape to the brightest data point .",
    "we have compared the best fit parameters of the main counts with that derived from composite samples of clusters at various redshifts .",
    "more specifically we have selected the composite luminosity functions derived by @xcite .",
    "their sample is composed by archival hubble space telescope / advanced camera for surveys images of six clusters in the redshift interval @xmath125 , including also the present cluster .",
    "they derive a characteristic luminosity @xmath126 in the r band and a faint end slope @xmath127 for galaxies within the virial radius , i.e. in a much larger volume than sampled in the core of cl0024 + 17 .",
    "@xcite derived stacked luminosity functions of xmm",
    " lss clusters of class 1 at different average redshifts .",
    "in particular at redshifts @xmath128 they find @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "their slope is steeper , probably due to the larger area sampled for their clusters as noted by the same authors .",
    "we retain both slopes to enclose the uncertainties present so far at the faint end .",
    "although there is a good agreement on the value of the characteristic luminosity among cl0024 + 17 and the two cluster samples , the faint end slope in our cluster appears somewhat flatter .",
    "a speculative explanation for this flattening is given in terms of a stellar tidal stripping from the halos of galaxies in the cluster core .    the two luminosity function shapes are shown in figure 9 in terms of surface counts normalized to the cl0024 + 17 counts at @xmath131 .",
    "the bright schechter component found in cl0024 + 17 has then been added to the two counts .",
    "since galaxies of intermediate mass / luminosity are those which lose a significant amonut of stellar mass from their halos due to tidal stripping , they dim progressively their luminosity as clusters relax .",
    "thus it is interesting to compare the cl0024 galaxy emissivity @xmath132 with that predicted by the two cluster luminosity functions .",
    "specifically we have computed the quantity @xmath133 for the two composite luminosity functions , where the integration in luminosity has been done in the representative interval @xmath134 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the galaxy emissivity in the cl0024 core ( within 200 kpc ) is smaller than that predicted on the basis of the average cluster luminosity functions and the fractional loss of galaxy emissivity ranges from 19% to 37% for the two slopes , respectively .",
    "thus , the fractional galaxy emissivity missing in the cl0024 core appears to be consistent with the fractional emission of the icl , @xmath135% of the galaxy emission .",
    "this result reinforces the scenario where icl in cluster cores is produced by stars stripped from the halos of their parent galaxies in the cluster potential well , as described in the previous section .",
    "the stripping produces a flattening of the faint end counts or luminosity functions in the cluster core with respect to the average shape derived from cluster galaxy counts within the virial radius .",
    "thus the average cluster luminosity functions derived by @xcite and @xcite appear steeper than our lf derived in the cl0024 core since they are derived in much larger clusters volumes , up to the virial radius ( e.g. of the order of megaparsec ) . in the latter case",
    "the lfs are steeper since they are dominated by galaxies located far from the central 200 kpc region where tidal stripping is more effective and icl is more intense . in other words , we predict a faint lf slope which should flatten considering volume shells approaching the cluster center .",
    "the amount of flattening observed in the cl0024 luminosity function is quantitatively consistent with the measured icl within a radius of 200 kpc .",
    "we have derived an estimate of the diffuse icl in the cluster cl0024 + 17 at @xmath4 to connect this quantity and its spatial distribution with the dynamical properties of the cluster core mainly due to the action of the stellar tidal stripping .",
    "the main objective has been reached through an accurate evaluation of the systematics introduced in the flat fielding and background subtraction procedures , and after careful removal of the galaxies light in the cluster center .",
    "this has been obtained through profile fitting using the galfit software package .",
    "only the sum of the galaxy profiles has then been subtracted from the original image and the residual intensity distribution obtained in this way was considered representative of the icl spatial distribution .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    * the icl distribution due to the stripping action of the brightest galaxies in the cluster core extends at least up to 200 kpc from the center . *",
    "the radial intensity profile of the icl derived from circular apertures has an exponential behavior .",
    "a small deviation is present at @xmath136 kpc due to the action of a distinct group of galaxies .",
    "an exponential decrease is consistent with the expectation of theoretical cdm models where intracluster stars are produced by tidal stripping in galaxy halos . * after removing foreground galaxies on the basis of the available spectroscopic or photometric redshifts , we have estimated an integrated icl fraction of @xmath135% of the overall galaxy light within 150 kpc . * the average radial profile of the icl fraction increases with decreasing radius reaching a maximum value @xmath137% at @xmath138 kpc . at smaller",
    "radii a bending is present followed by a significant decrease due to the overlap of the halos of the cluster brightest galaxies . * simple predictions in cdm scenarios show that the ratio between the total stellar mass lost by stripping over the stellar mass present in galaxies is almost independent of the physical properties of the generic galaxy hosting stripping action .",
    "the ratio mainly depends on the global cluster properties such as e.g. , total mass , and dm profile shape .",
    "adopting the mass value of @xmath139 m@xmath140 and a navarro - frenk - white dm profile with concentration parameter @xmath141 , very close to the values derived from extensive lensing analysis on this cluster , we predict an icl fraction profile in broad agreement with the observational trend for @xmath142 kpc .",
    "* we have computed the galaxy counts in the core of the cluster ( @xmath143 kpc ) . fitting two schechter laws , one for the brightest bin populated by the dominant brightest galaxies in the core and one for the remaining sample , we derived a characteristic absolute magnitude @xmath144 for the main component , consistent with that estimated from composite cluster samples at similar redshifts .",
    "the faint slope , however , appears definitely flatter , @xmath124 , with respect to the average slope derived from composite cluster samples ( @xmath145 to @xmath146 ) .",
    "* since the composite cluster samples are derived on much larger volumes up to their virial radius , we have tested whether stellar tidal stripping can be responsible for the observed bending of the counts in our cluster core .",
    "normalizing composite average counts ( or equivalently luminosity functions ) to the value derived for cl0024 + 17 at @xmath144 , we have computed the relative difference of total emissivity produced by the composite and cl0024 + 17 counts .",
    "this difference amounts to 19%@xmath147% for @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "the emissivity `` lost '' in cl0024 + 17 appears in broad agreement with the icl fraction we have measured in the core , @xmath149% , suggesting that the stripping activity , bending the galaxy counts , can quantitatively explain the observed icl fraction .",
    "this pilot study will be applied to more clusters at different redshifts to explore the dependence of the icl fraction on the cluster physical ( e.g. mass and concentration ) and evolutionary ( e.g. relaxation status ) properties .",
    "a large amount of statistics will enable us to follow on average the stellar stripping activity during the evolution of the cluster cores .",
    "in this appendix we derive more explicitly some expressions used in the text . defining the function @xmath150 as in the text , equation ( 1 )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath151 where we have expressed the denominator in equation ( 1 ) in terms of the square of the cluster circular velocity @xmath152 .",
    "writing the latter as @xmath153 we obtain @xmath154 this can be simplified defining an effective velocity dispersion as @xmath79 ( in analogy with the isothermal case ) .",
    "the satellite size @xmath76 can be related to the density profile assuming that at the tidal radius is @xmath155 , which yields @xmath156^{1/2}$ ] ; then equation ( 2 ) reads @xmath78 where @xmath116 is defined in the text ( equation ( 3 ) ) .    assuming an exponential form for the initial stellar mass distribution , the mass lost can be written as @xmath157 where @xmath87 is the disk exponential scale length , and we have expressed the central disk surface density @xmath88 in terms of the initial stellar mass of the galaxy satellite @xmath158 .",
    "we relate the disk size @xmath87 to the virial radius of the satellite galaxy @xmath159 assuming angular momentum conservation during the formation of the disk . assuming equal values for the baryon - to - dm angular momentum and mass ratios , yields @xmath160 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath161 is the spin parameter of the dm halo , for which we take the standard average value @xmath162",
    ". then equation ( 4 ) yields @xmath163    we now substitute expression ( 2 ) for @xmath89 in the latter equation , substitute @xmath73 for the cluster core radius , and use the standard scaling relations @xmath164^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath165^{1/3}$ ] for both the cluster and the satellite galaxies .",
