    "a decrease in the number of observed @xmath1 in heavy ion collisions due to the screening of the color confining potential was proposed many years ago @xcite as a signature of a deconfined phase .",
    "it is argued that as the system cools and the deconfined phase disappears , these heavy quarks will most likely form a final hadronic state with one of the much more numerous light quarks . the result will be a decreased population of @xmath1 relative to those formed initially in the heavy ion collision .",
    "here we study a scenario which can only be realized at rhic ( and lhc ) energies , where the average number of initially - produced heavy quark pairs @xmath2 is substantially above unity in each central collision",
    ". then one can amplify the probability of @xmath1 formation by a factor which is proportional to @xmath3 , _ if and only if a space - time region of deconfined quarks and gluons is present .",
    "_ realization of this result will depend on the efficiency of this new formation mechanism during the deconfinement period .",
    "we have developed a simple model to estimate the magnitude of this effect , and examined the sensitivity of results to various input parameters and assumptions .",
    "for expected conditions at rhic , almost all of the directly - produced @xmath1 will be dissociated even in peripheral collisions . to include the effects of our new formation mechanism , we parameterize the final @xmath1 number in each event as follows :",
    "of the @xmath4 charm quark pairs initially produced in a central heavy ion collision , let @xmath5 be the number of those pairs which form @xmath1 states in the normal confining vacuum potential . at hadronization",
    ", the final number @xmath6 will contain a small fraction @xmath7 of the initial number @xmath5 .",
    "the majority of @xmath6 will be formed by this new mechanism which we expect to be quadratic in the remaining @xmath8 heavy quark pairs , with a proportionality parameter @xmath9 .",
    "( we include in the new mechanism both formation and suppression effects , since they occur simultaneously in the deconfined region . )",
    "the final population is then    @xmath10    for each @xmath4 initially - produced heavy quark pairs , we then average over the distribution of @xmath5 , introducing the probability @xmath11 that a given heavy quark pair was in a bound state before the deconfined phase was formed .",
    "( this factor includes the effect of interactions with target and projectile nucleons ) .",
    "we finally average over the distribution of @xmath4 , using a poisson distribution with average value @xmath2 , to obtain the expected @xmath12 final population per collision ,    @xmath13    the bound state ",
    "suppression \" factor @xmath14 is just the ratio of this average population to the average initially - produced bound state population per collision , @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16    without the new production mechanism , @xmath17 and the suppression factor is @xmath18 .",
    "( even the fitted parameter @xmath7 contains some effects of the new mechanism , since formation can reoccur subsequent to the dissociation of an initial @xmath1 .",
    "here we use it as an upper limit with which to compare the complete result . )",
    "however , it is possible that for sufficiently large values of @xmath9 and @xmath2 this factor could actually exceed unity , i.e. one would predict an * enhancement * in the heavy quarkonium production rates to be the signature of deconfinement ! we thus proceed to estimate expected @xmath9-values for @xmath1 production at rhic .",
    "this model is adapted from our previous work on the formation of @xmath19 mesons @xcite .",
    "initial results for the @xmath1 application are found in reference @xcite . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume the deconfined phase is an ideal gas of free gluons and light quarks .",
    "any @xmath1 in this medium will be subject to dissociation via collisions with gluons .",
    "( this is the dynamic counterpart of the plasma screening scenario , in which the color - confinement force is screened away in the hot dense plasma @xcite . )",
    "the primary formation mechanism is just the reverse of the dissociation reaction , in which a free charm quark and antiquark are captured in the @xmath1 bound state , emitting a color octet gluon .",
    "thus it is unavoidable for this model of quarkonium suppression that a corresponding mechanism for quarkonium production must be present .",
    "the competition between the rates of these reactions integrated over the lifetime of the qgp then determines the final @xmath1 population .",
    "note that in this scenario it is impossible to separate the formation process from the dissociation ( suppression ) process .",
    "both processes occur simultaneously , in contrast to the situation in which the formation only occurs at the initial times before the qgp is present .    the time evolution if the @xmath1 population is then given by    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the proper time in a comoving volume cell and @xmath22 denotes the number density @xmath23 $ ] of species _",
    "i_. the reactivity @xmath24 @xmath25 $ ] is the reaction rate @xmath26 averaged over the momentum distribution of the initial participants , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath1 and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "the gluon density is determined by the equilibrium value in the qgp at each temperature .",
    "exact charm conservation is enforced throughout the calculation .",
    "the initial volume at @xmath32 is allowed to undergo longitudinal expansion @xmath33 .",
    "the expansion is taken to be isentropic , @xmath34 = constant , which then provides a generic temperature - time profile .",
    "for simplicity , we assume the transverse spatial distributions are uniform , and use a thermal equilibrium momentum distribution for both gluons and charm quarks .",
    "( this last simplification requires large energy loss mechanisms for the charm quarks in the deconfined medium , which is indicated by several recent studies @xcite ) .    with these inputs and assumptions ,",
    "the solution of equation [ eqkin ] is precisely that anticipated in equation [ eqquad ] , with    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the hadronization time determined by the initial temperature ( @xmath37 is a variable parameter ) and final temperature ( @xmath38 = 150 mev ends the deconfining phase ) , and    @xmath39^{-1}\\ , d\\tau}. \\label{eqbeta}\\ ] ]    for our quantitative estimates , we utilize a cross section for the dissociation of @xmath1 due to collisions with gluons which is based on the operator product expansion @xcite , which is utilized with detailed balance factors to calculate the primary formation rate for the capture of a charm and anticharm quark into the @xmath1 .",
    "in figure [ jpsitime ] we show the time development of the @xmath1 ( solid line ) along with the separate formation and dissociation rates ( dotted lines , arbitrary units ) .",
    "this calculation maintained exact charm conservation , so that the solutions followed evolution of both bound and free charm quarks .",
    "one sees the expected decrease of the formation rate due to the volume expansion , and the decrease of the gluon dissociaton rate due to the decrease in gluon density with temperature .",
    "some typical calculated values of the @xmath1 final population are shown in figure [ figquad ] .",
    "the parameter values for thermalization time @xmath40 = 0.5 fm , initial volume @xmath41 with r = 6 fm , and a range of initial temperature 300 mev @xmath42 500 mev , are all compatible with expectations for a central collision at rhic .",
    "the quadratic fits of equation [ eqquad ] are superimposed , verifying our expectations that the decrease in initial unbound charm is a small effect .",
    "( these fits also contain a small linear term for the cases in which @xmath5 is nonzero , which accounts for the increase of the unbound charm population when dissociation occurs . )",
    "the fitted @xmath7 values decrease quite rapidly with increasing @xmath37 as expected , and give reasonable upper limits for the suppression factor of directly - produced @xmath1 in central collisions at rhic due to gluon dissociation in a deconfined phase .",
    "the corresponding @xmath9 values are relatively insensitive to @xmath37 , remaining in the range @xmath43 .",
    "these fitted parameters must be supplemented by values of @xmath11 and @xmath2 to determine the  suppression \" factor from equation [ eqsupp ] for the new mechanism .",
    "we use @xmath2 = 10 from a pqcd estimate @xcite .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate of @xmath44 for @xmath11 , from fitted values of a color evaporation model @xcite , is reduced by the suppression due to interactions with target and beam nucleons . for central collisions",
    "we use 0.6 for this factor , which results from the extrapolation of the observed nuclear effects for p - a and smaller a - b central interactions .    with these parameters fixed ,",
    "we predict from equation [ eqsupp ] an * enhancement * factor for @xmath1 production of @xmath45 , for initial temperatures between 300 and 500 mev .",
    "the suppression of initially - produced @xmath1 alone ranges from factors of 10 to 100 , so that the enhancement prediction involves a huge increase ( factors of approximately one to two orders of magnitude ) in the final population of @xmath1 at rhic .",
    "we also predict how this new effect will vary with the centrality of the collision , which has been a key feature of deconfinement signatures analyzed at cern sps energies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 and @xmath9 parameters are recalculated , using appropriate variation of initial conditions with impact parameter b. from nuclear geometry and the total non - diffractive nucleon - nucleon cross section at rhic energies , one can estimate the total number of participant nucleons @xmath46 and the corresponding density per unit transverse area @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the former quantity has been shown to be directly proportional to the total transverse energy produced in a heavy ion collision @xcite .",
    "the latter quantity is used , along with the bjorken - model estimate of initial energy density @xcite , to provide an estimate of how the initial temperature of the deconfined region varies with impact parameter .",
    "we also use the ratio of these quantities to define an initial transverse area within which deconfinement is possible , thus completing the initial conditions needed to calculate the @xmath1 production and suppression .",
    "the average initial charm number @xmath2 varies with impact parameter in proportion to the nuclear overlap integral @xmath48(b ) .",
    "the impact - parameter dependence of the fraction @xmath11 is determined by the average path length encountered by initial @xmath1 as they pass through the remaining nucleons , @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "all of these b - dependent effects are normalized to the previous values used for calculations at @xmath50 .",
    "it is revealing to express these results in terms of the ratio of final @xmath1 to initially - produced charm pairs . in figure",
    "[ figjpsib ] , the solid symbols are the full results predicted with the inclusion of our new production mechanism at rhic .",
    "the centrality dependence is represented by the total participant number @xmath51(b ) . for comparison",
    "we also show predictions without the new mechanism , when only dissociation by gluons is included ( @xmath29 = 0 ) .",
    "it is evident not only that the new mechanism dominates the @xmath1 production in the deconfined medium at all impact parameters , but also that an increase rather than a decrease is predicted for central collisions .",
    "these features should be distinguishable in the upcoming rhic experiments .",
    "in our model of a deconfined region , we have used the vacuum values for masses and binding energy of @xmath1 , and assumed that the effects of deconfinement are completely included by the dissociation via gluon collisions . for a complementary viewpoint ,",
    "we have also employed a deconfinement model in which the @xmath1 is completely dissociated when temperatures exceed some critical screening value @xmath52 .",
    "below that temperature , the new formation mechanism will still be able to operate , and we use the same cross sections and kinematics .",
    "we find that for @xmath52 = 280 mev , the final @xmath1 population is approximately unchanged , while decreasing @xmath52 to 180 mev could reduce the @xmath1 production by factors of 2 or 3 .",
    "these results are shown in figure [ jpsiscreen ] .",
    "we have also checked the sensitivity of these results to several other assumptions and parameters . among these",
    "are : ( a ) change in initial charm production due to gluon shadowing ; ( b ) alternative cross sections with different magnitudes and threshold behaviors ; ( c ) transverse expansion of the qgp ; ( d ) non - chemical equilibrium for gluons ; ( e)non - thermal momentum distributions for charm quarks .",
    "the effects of varying these assumptions produce both positive and negative changes in the final @xmath1 populations .",
    "the largest effect could be a decrease by a factor of 2 or 3 if one uses the initial pqcd momentum distributions for the charm quarks .",
    "taken together , however , it is unlikely that a conspiracy of these effects would qualitatively change the predicted enhancement effects of this deconfinement scenario .",
    "in summary , we predict that at rhic energies the @xmath1 production rate will provide a more interesting signal for deconfinement than has been previously realized",
    ". consideration of multiple heavy quark production made possible by higher collision energy effectively adds another dimension to the parameter space within which one searches for patterns of quarkonium behavior in a deconfined medium",
    ". it will be possible to experimentally  tune \" the number of initial heavy quark pairs by sweeping through either centrality or energy .",
    "one can then search for a @xmath1 production behavior which is predicted to be nonlinear in total charm . in our simplified kinetic model of @xmath1 formation in a free gas of quarks and gluons ,",
    "the new production mechanism predicts an enhancement rather than a suppression .",
    "these features should provide a signal at rhic which will be difficult to imitate with conventional hadronic processes .",
    "the extension of this scenario to lhc energies will involve hundreds of initially - produced charm quark pairs and multiple bottom pairs .",
    "we expect the effects of this new production mechanism to be striking .",
