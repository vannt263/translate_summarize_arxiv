    "the zero - range process has recently received widespread attention in the literature of nonequilibrium stochastic processes @xcite .",
    "there are three main reasons for this ( see @xcite for a review ) : ( i ) it provides a minimal model for more complex systems , ( ii ) the steady state has a simple factorised form , ( iii ) it exhibits a steady state phase transition , between a fluid and a condensate phase .",
    "the simple form of the steady state allows detailed analysis of this condensation transition .",
    "apart from being of interest in its own right ( as an example of a phase transition in an exactly solvable steady state ) , the transition is of particular interest because of its relation to coarsening phenomena in 1@xmath0 driven systems @xcite .",
    "further , it has provided a general criterion to determine the existence of phase separation in driven systems with conserved density @xcite .    in the zero - range process",
    ", particles hop from site to site with hop rates determined by the number of particles at the departure site .",
    "two types of condensation transition , whereby a finite fraction of the particles condense onto a single site , have been studied @xcite : condensation induced by site - dependent hop rates and condensation induced by the asymptotic dependence of the hop rate on particle number at the site .",
    "the former is related to bose - einstein condensation whereas the latter involves a spontaneously broken symmetry .    here",
    ", we generalise to a zero - range process with two species of particles .",
    "the hop rates of each species are determined by the numbers present of both species at the departure site . under certain conditions",
    "which we specify , the steady state again assumes a simple factorised form , which we use to demonstrate a new mechanism of condensation transition . in this case",
    "the condensation of one species is induced by the distribution of particles of the other species .",
    "one perspective on this two species model is as a system of particles moving on an evolving landscape the dynamics of one particle species depend locally on how many particles of the other species are present ( the landscape ) and these particles too are subject to locally determined dynamics .",
    "the new condensation mechanism then is one where the condensate is induced by the landscape whose evolution is in turn coupled to the particle distribution .",
    "such interplay between particle dynamics and an evolving landscape is of considerable interest @xcite .",
    "we define a two species zero - range process as follows . consider a chain of @xmath1 sites , with periodic boundary conditions , and containing @xmath2 particles of species @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles of species @xmath5 . sites , labelled @xmath6 , contain @xmath7 particles of species @xmath3 and @xmath8 particles of species @xmath5",
    ". particles hop to their nearest neighbour site to the right , species @xmath3 with rate @xmath9 and species @xmath5 with rate @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the occupation variables of the departure site . thus the hopping rates , which depend on the number of particles of both species at the departure site , contain the interaction between species .",
    "the steady state for the two species model can be derived in a similar way to that for the single species zero - range process @xcite .",
    "first , we define @xmath13 to be the steady state probability of finding the system in the configuration @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "now , the steady state master equation , which demands that the probability current into a particular configuration is equal to the probability current out of the same configuration , can be written @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the usual heaviside function and ensures that the site @xmath19 is occupied in order for a particle either to have arrived or to be able to vacate there .",
    "the first term on the r.h.s of ( [ me ] ) is a gain term due to an @xmath3 particle hopping into site @xmath19 from site @xmath20 , the second term is a loss term due to an @xmath3 particle hopping out of site @xmath19 ; the third and fourth terms represent analogous processes for the @xmath5 particles .",
    "we seek a solution to ( [ me ] ) where @xmath13 is given by a product measure ( i.e. a product of factors ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a normalisation .",
    "equation ( [ me ] ) can be satisfied by substituting in the steady state ( [ pm ] ) , and asking that the gain and loss terms due to the dynamics of the @xmath3 particles cancel independently of the gain and loss terms due to the dynamics of the @xmath5 particles . then",
    ", if this cancellation is achieved for each term @xmath19 in the sum individually , one finds that for all @xmath19 , @xmath23 for all @xmath24 , and @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "these equations in turn imply that @xmath27 for all @xmath19 .",
    "both constants are set equal to unity ( they only appear as an overall factor in the normalisation ) .",
    "the two relations ( [ cancelas ] ) and ( [ cancelbs ] ) imply a constraint on the choice of @xmath28 and @xmath29 i.e. we can use ( [ cancelas ] ) and ( [ cancelbs ] ) to obtain two expressions for @xmath30 in terms of @xmath31 : @xmath32 but both of these expressions must give the same result , therefore the hopping rates are required to obey the constraint , @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "the choices of @xmath35 and @xmath36 remain unconstrained .",
    "finally , the expression for @xmath30 is obtained by iterating ( [ cancelas ] ) and ( [ cancelbs ] ) , hence @xmath37^{-1 } \\prod_{j=1}^{m_l } \\left [ v(0,j ) \\right]^{-1 } \\;,\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath38 .",
    "although not immediately obvious , @xmath9 and @xmath10 do play symmetric roles in ( [ fnm ] ) , but this symmetry is obscured within the constraint ( [ ce ] ) on the hopping rates .    also note that we have the freedom to choose _ any _ desired form for @xmath30 , then by substituting this form into ( [ cancelas ] ) and ( [ cancelbs ] ) we deduce the hopping rates which would lead to such a steady state ",
    "such rates are then guaranteed to satisfy the condition ( [ ce ] ) .    in order to look for phase transitions",
    ", it will prove useful to consider the normalisation , @xmath22 , defined in equation ( [ pm ] ) .",
    "this quantity plays a role analogous to the canonical partition function of equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "it can be written @xmath39 where the delta - functions ensure that we have @xmath2 particles of species @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles of species @xmath5 in the system . using an integral representation of the delta - functions yields @xmath40 which leads us naturally to define the generating function @xmath41    we now assume that in the limit @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath42 ( with the particle densities held fixed ) , the integral in equation ( [ norm ] ) is dominated by its saddle point .",
    "the saddle point equations , which involve the particle densities of species @xmath3 and @xmath5 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , are found to be @xmath45 these equations determine @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "for the saddle point to be valid , @xmath46 and @xmath47 must be less than or equal to the radii of convergence of @xmath48 in order that we can perform the sum ( [ fzy ] ) in the first place .",
    "we note also that because all derivatives of @xmath48 are positive , the saddle point , if valid , must be unique . in the following",
    ", we will find that it is only possible to solve ( [ spd ] ) in the allowed ranges of @xmath46 and @xmath47 for certain values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we now consider how a condensation transition may arise from the interaction of the two species .",
    "a general case of interest is where the hopping rates of one of the particle species depend only on the number of the particles of the other species at the site e.g. @xmath51 .",
    "then , by ( [ cancelbs ] ) , @xmath52 , and @xmath9 is determined by ( [ cancelas ] ) ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 are general functions of @xmath11 ) . in this case",
    ", the @xmath3 particles play the role of an evolving landscape that determines the dynamics of the @xmath5 particles . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case where @xmath55 and @xmath56 , then @xmath57 for all values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; @xmath58 is a constant .",
    "physically , these hopping rates are such that the @xmath5 particles hop more slowly as the number of @xmath3 particles at the departure site increases , while the @xmath3 particles slow as the number of @xmath5 particles increases but they hop more quickly the more particles of the same species occupy the departure site .",
    "the generating function and its first derivatives , having performed the sum over @xmath12 , are obtained as @xmath59 ^ 2}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the radii of convergence of these series are @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these expressions determine @xmath46 and @xmath47 , given @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as prescribed by the saddle point equations ( [ spd ] ) .",
    "one can demonstrate the existence of a phase transition in the following way . for a given @xmath46 , both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are monotonically increasing functions of @xmath47 . then by analysing the saddle point equations for the four cases @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath61 , and @xmath60 , the dependences of @xmath49 and @xmath50 on @xmath47 , for fixed @xmath46 , are obtained .",
    "these are shown in figure [ fig : dense ] , where @xmath64 .     and",
    "@xmath50 for contours of fixed @xmath46 and as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "the dashed line in the right hand graph illustrates how @xmath50 varies as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath47 given that @xmath49 is fixed . ]    now , if we consider a system containing a density @xmath49 of @xmath3 particles , then the solution of ( [ spd ] ) requires that @xmath46 and @xmath47 lie in the range @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in this range ,",
    "@xmath50 increases monotonically from @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath62 , to its maximum value allowed by the saddle point equations , where @xmath61 and @xmath69 .",
    "therefore we can only solve the saddle point equations for @xmath49 and @xmath50 if @xmath50 is less than this ( @xmath49-dependent ) maximum .",
    "when @xmath50 exceeds this maximum , the saddle point approximation is no longer valid and a phase transition ensues .",
    "the critical line is given by the values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as a function of @xmath46 , where @xmath61 .",
    "along this line @xmath49 and @xmath50 are related by @xmath70 this is most easily seen by setting @xmath61 in ( [ fzy ] ) , ( [ zdzfzy ] ) and ( [ ydyfzy ] ) , and then spotting that one can write @xmath71/c$ ] . then dividing through by @xmath48 yields ( [ critline ] ) .",
    "hence we obtain the phase diagram shown in figure [ fig : phase_diagram ] .",
    "( 55,55 )    ( 5,5)(1,0)50 ( 5,5)(0,1)50 ( 20.2,5.2)(1,1)32    ( 14,33)fluid phase ( 35,16)condensate ( 40,12)phase    ( 0.5,45)@xmath49 ( 45,2)@xmath50    ( 17,1.6)@xmath72    we interpret this as a transition between a fluid phase , where the saddle point equations can be solved , and a condensate phase . in the condensate phase , @xmath50 exceeds a maximum critical value and the excess @xmath5 particles condense onto a single site . the number of @xmath5 particles in the condensate is proportional to the system size @xmath1in the limit @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath73 it contains a finite fraction of an infinite number of particles",
    ". however , we note that for @xmath74 , @xmath75 if @xmath11 is finite . but the current of @xmath3 particles must be the same across all bonds in the system as a result of continuity , and this current must be finite  the current of @xmath3 particles away from the condensate is finite  therefore we must have that @xmath76 at the condensate in order that the current out of the condensate site is finite .",
    "for @xmath11 large , @xmath77 and this must be finite , therefore @xmath78 at the condensate then since @xmath79 here , @xmath80 .",
    "thus the condensate phase is characterised by a condensate of @xmath5 particles which is sustained by a ` weak ' condensate of @xmath3 particles .",
    "this picture is consistent with numerical results : an exact recursion relation for the partition function can be obtained from ( [ zlnm ] ) and is found to be @xmath81 this expression was iterated exactly on a computer up to systems of size @xmath82 , for different values of the densities and using @xmath83 .",
    "it is also straightforward to obtain an exact expression for @xmath84 , the probability that a site contains exactly @xmath11 particles of species @xmath3 and @xmath12 particles of species @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath84 is given by @xmath85 by summing this equation over @xmath11 or @xmath12 one obtains equations for @xmath86 , the probability of finding exactly @xmath11 particles of species @xmath3 at a site , and @xmath87 , the probability of finding exactly @xmath12 particles of species @xmath5 at a site .",
    "these probabilities are plotted in figure [ fig : dists ] for two different values of the densities .     vs. @xmath11 , and on the right @xmath87 vs. @xmath12 , for systems of size @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "we have shown that one may define a two species zero - range process where the steady state is described by a product measure ( [ pm ] ) and we have derived conditions under which the product measure holds ( [ ce ] ) .",
    "this simple form for the steady state makes the model amenable to detailed analysis .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the model undergoes a novel kind of condensation transition .",
    "it is clearly of interest to investigate the generality of this transition with respect to the hopping rates . since we can always construct dynamics , using ( [ cancelas ] , [ cancelbs ] ) , that lead to a product measure ( [ pm ] ) with arbitrary @xmath93",
