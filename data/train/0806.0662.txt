    "our understanding of the cosmic star formation history ( sfh ) of galaxies has progressed significantly over the past decade ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in the same time",
    "the space density of neutral hydrogen gas has been measured over the majority of cosmic history ( see figure  8 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the evolution of the atomic hydrogen ( hi ) in the universe will be comprehensively determined within the next few years by extremely sensitive surveys with the next generation of radio telescope instrumentation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is timely to consider mechanisms associated with this evolution .",
    "the space density of hi in galaxies appears to evolve surprisingly little from @xmath1 to @xmath2 @xcite , a span of roughly 10gyr , the latter half of which sees a decline in the space density of star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies by almost an order of magnitude ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the sfr density it is easy to show that the hi plus molecular gas at high redshift would be exhausted on timescales of a few gyr if it were not continually replenished .",
    "@xcite presents a model incorporating gas infall , outflows and consumption by star formation , to explain both replenishment and the mass - metallicity relation in high - redshift ( @xmath3 ) galaxies .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations advocating hot and cold modes of accretion indicate that the infall rate closely tracks the star formation rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with star formation moderated by the rate of infall .",
    "the simulations , however , neglect gas outflows from galaxies , which are a significant component of gas depletion .",
    "the quantitative infall rates predicted are thus insufficient to maintain a constant hi density in galaxies .",
    "observed rates of gas infall in local galaxies , also , are only about 10% of the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "the difficulties in explaining replenishment through infall leave the physical mechanism of this replenishment as a critical open question in galaxy evolution .",
    "in this letter we suggest a mechanism directly associated with the sfr in galaxies that can provide the necessary replenishment of neutral gas to maintain an essentially unevolving , or slowly evolving , hi mass density .",
    "we infer the density of gas required to reproduce the observed sfh in  [ data ] . in  [ deltarho ]",
    "we present a number of models for the replenishment of this gas , and show that a replenishment proportional to the sfr density can reproduce the necessary gas mass density .",
    "a replenishment mechanism associated with galactic supershells is detailed in  [ disc ] , and the results",
    "are summarised in  [ summ ] . throughout this analysis",
    "we adopt the  737 \" cosmology with @xmath4kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while our motivation is to understand the observed lack of significant evolution in the hi mass density , we approach this by considering the total mass density of gas available to form stars , which includes molecular as well as atomic gas .",
    "we neglect the intricacies in the conversion of hi to molecular gas associated with the star formation process , as this occurs on timescales very short compared to those involved in this analysis .",
    "what is important is the total reservoir of gas available for star formation ,  star - forming gas , \" @xmath8 , at a given redshift , comprised of both atomic and molecular gas .",
    "star formation is an inefficient process and @xmath8 will likely be somewhat less than the total of the atomic and molecular gas mass densities .",
    "the cosmic evolution of the hi mass density has been challenging to measure .",
    "there is an implicit assumption that the damped ly@xmath9 absorbers used to measure the hi mass density at @xmath10 are representative of the galaxies used to trace the sfh .",
    "the best current measurements suggest that this is not an unreasonable assumption @xcite , while also highlighting the difficulty in obtaining observational constraints on @xmath8 . in the absence of direct observational measurements",
    ", we estimate @xmath8 indirectly from the observed sfh , using the local relationship between gas and sfr surface densities from @xcite .",
    "we calculate @xmath8 using equation  ( 10 ) of @xcite , and the results are shown in figure  [ fig : hiandtau ] .",
    "the open triangles in figure  [ fig : hiandtau ] are derived from the piecewise linear fit to the sfh of @xcite , their table  2 , for their  sala \" initial mass function ( imf ) ( detailed in @xcite @xcite and @xcite @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the open squares correspond to the sfh of @xcite .",
    "this is based on an evolving imf , more top - heavy at higher redshift , which reduces the derived sfr densities and gives lower inferred @xmath8 at high-@xmath11 than a universal imf .",
    "these estimates make the implicit assumption that the kennicutt - schmidt law for star formation @xcite is valid at all redshifts , an assumption questioned by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "the relation has , though , been successfully used to explain the mass - metallicity relationship seen in @xmath3 galaxies by @xcite and in hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite seems to arise as a natural consequence of gas physics . in the absence of detailed observations of molecular gas in large numbers of high redshift galaxies , the assumption that the local relationship holds at higher redshift is the simplest with which to explore further .",
    "the gas consumption timescale comes from dividing @xmath8 by the stellar mass density remaining in stars and stellar remnants , inferred from the sfr density .",
    "this gives timescales of @xmath12gyr with the lower value at higher redshift where the sfr density is largest .",
    "this short timescale , derived from the global properties of all galaxies , is strikingly similar to the gas consumption timescales found for individual nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "to explore the interaction between gas consumption and replenishment we show the effects of several simple models in figure  [ fig : gasmodels ] .",
    "all models begin at a lookback time , @xmath13 , of @xmath14gyr ( @xmath15 ) assuming an initial value for @xmath16 , with @xmath17 calculated simply as the integral over time . at each time - step gas",
    "is consumed by star formation ( @xmath18 ) and a similar amount in gas outflows .",
    "this is a coarse approximation , but based on galactic outflow rates in the nearby universe @xcite it may be reasonable when averaged over large populations of star forming galaxies . ] .",
    "gas is returned to the interstellar medium ( ism ) through stellar evolutionary processes ( stellar winds , supernova ejecta ) with a recycling fraction of @xmath19 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , adding a factor @xmath20 . for the sala imf , @xmath21 , while other imfs will have different recycled fractions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "finally a replenishment factor @xmath22 is added .",
    "this can be expressed as : @xmath23 these simplifications hide a wealth of complex ism and igm interactions , including the fact that material returned to the ism through stellar evolution , as well as infalling gas , may contribute to ionized , or otherwise non - star - forming components as well as directly to @xmath8 .",
    "these details are subsumed into the effective replenishment factor , @xmath22 .    a model with no gas replenishment , @xmath24 ,",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : gasmodels ] ( the dashed line ) , emphasising the rapid consumption timescale .",
    "two models assuming constant rates of replenishment , @xmath25mpc@xmath26yr@xmath5 ( dash - dotted line ) and @xmath27mpc@xmath26yr@xmath5 ( dash - triple - dotted line ) , are also shown .",
    "the  bounce \" seen in these models arises from an early excess in consumption followed by progressively decreasing consumption as @xmath28 declines for @xmath29 , predicting excess @xmath8 at lookback times @xmath30gyr ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "replenishment factors proportional to the sfr density provide an obvious way to ensure @xmath8 remains constant with time .",
    "a replenishment factor of @xmath32 in equation  ( [ theeqn ] ) gives @xmath33 at all redshifts ( dotted line in figure  [ fig : gasmodels ] ) .",
    "different constants of proportionality allow for slowly varying changes in @xmath8 . with @xmath34 ( a factor 0.95 of that required for complete replenishment ;",
    "* ) the replenishment does not fully balance consumption , and gives a slow decline in the global gas density ( heavy solid line in figure  [ fig : gasmodels ] ) .    in the following section we consider supershells in the ism as the driver of a physical mechanism for replenishment .",
    "supershells are both directly associated with star formation and are highly efficient at converting hot phase gas into star - forming gas .",
    "the ism in galaxies contains expanding supershells or superbubbles associated with previous generations of star formation .",
    "we propose that the neutral and molecular gas replenishment in the walls of supershells is sufficient , and of the appropriate form , to provide a natural mechanism explaining the relatively flat evolution in the hi mass density .",
    "supershells are large scale expanding shells of gas driven by supernovae ( sne ) and stellar winds from ob star clusters @xcite .",
    "supershells have long been suggested to have a triggering effect on subsequent generations of star formation @xcite , and are effective at replenishing star - forming gas through several mechanisms .",
    "first , supershells are efficient at cooling and recombining ionized gas through radiative cooling in shell walls @xcite",
    ". this may be critical in converting gas shock - heated by previous generations of sne within a galaxy , or new hot - mode infall gas , to a potentially star - forming state , as the @xmath35k gas may otherwise never cool to support subsequent star formation .",
    "second , molecular gas can form from neutral gas _ in situ _ in shell walls , where compression and the development of instabilities leads to sufficiently high neutral gas densities to allow for cooling and self - shielding on timescales of @xmath36myr @xcite .",
    "finally , they can compress pre - existing molecular material to trigger molecular cloud collapse and star formation @xcite .",
    "the timescales for these processes are shorter than , or comparable to the supershell lifetime ( @xmath37myr ) , which is in turn short compared to the global gas consumption timescale of several gyr .    to establish whether the replenishment achievable in supershells is sufficient to make this mechanism feasible , we first convert the replenishment rates given in  [ deltarho ] into a replenished mass per sn event .",
    "a replenishment rate proportional to the sfr density is also proportional to the rate of supernova type ii ( snii ) . converting a proportionality to sfr density into one depending on the snii rate , @xmath38 , depends on the assumed imf . from @xcite @xmath39 for the sala imf .",
    "the replenishment rate @xmath32 becomes @xmath40 .",
    "the other extreme choice of imf consistent with the normalization of the sfh @xcite is that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter the bg imf ) . for the bg imf @xmath41 .",
    "the recycled fraction is @xmath42 @xcite , changing the consumption term in equation  ( [ theeqn ] ) to @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding replenishment rate is @xmath44 .",
    "these extremes imply that , depending on the imf , sufficient gas replenishment to maintain a constant hi mass density with redshift would be achieved if each sn event caused the recombination and cooling of @xmath45 of gas .",
    "these imfs are the extrema given the sfh normalization limits , and most reasonable imfs should result in masses within this range .",
    "detailed measurements to confirm molecular gas formation within supershells are observationally challenging .",
    "we use the limited data currently available to assess the replenishment rates associated with supershells , and to establish whether at least one well - studied supershell achieves the required rate .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown explicit cases of molecular clumps along the edges of supershells , suggestive of some degree of _ in situ _ formation , with a significant amount of molecular material associated with the supershell walls .",
    "the supershell investigated by @xcite is associated with about @xmath46 of molecular gas , of which those authors estimate that @xmath47 likely comes from a pre - existing giant molecular cloud .",
    "of the remaining @xmath48 of molecular gas it is difficult to determine how much is pre - existing and how much has been cooled and recombined by the expansion of the shell .",
    "we can use @xmath48 as an upper limit to the replenishment rate .",
    "about 30 stars with stellar mass @xmath49 are required to form this supershell , including stars that may not yet have gone supernova .",
    "this gives @xmath50 of molecular mass replenished per sn event , a limit comfortably encompassing the required rate .",
    "this upper limit could change significantly depending on the fraction of pre - existing molecular material and also on the fraction of stars that have not yet gone supernova .",
    "not all sne lie within supershells , although @xcite estimate that a minimum of @xmath51 of snii should occur in superbubbles , increasing to @xmath52 when the spatial and temporal correlations of stellar clusters are considered .",
    "if @xmath47 of snii are associated with supershells , for example , this would increase the required replenishment rate per sn to @xmath53 .",
    "but even if as few as 10% of all snii contribute in this way to the replenishment , the rate implied by the results of @xcite would still be sufficient .",
    "this confirms that the necessary replenishment rates are likely to be achievable within supershells .",
    "the observed decline by a factor of two in the hi mass density may be a natural consequence of a replenishment rate about 95% of that required to match consumption , as shown by the heavy solid line in figure  [ fig : gasmodels ] .",
    "if the actual replenishment rate from supershells lies somewhere between the required rate and our derived upper limit , though , there may in fact be too much newly replenished gas to allow any decline in the neutral gas mass density . a possible resolution in this scenario",
    "would be increasing the proportionality between the gas outflow rates and the sfr as redshift decreases .",
    "this is not unreasonable , as the sfh is becoming progressively more dominated by lower - mass galaxies with decreasing redshift @xcite .",
    "galaxies with stellar masses @xmath54 dominate the sfh at @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "such low - mass galaxies lose more mass in gas outflows in proportion to their sfr than high - mass galaxies , simply due to the former s shallower potential wells ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this effect may contribute to the slow decline in the hi mass density .",
    "we have treated a number of complex physical processes in very general terms . while being cautious of oversimplification , we have attempted to capture the essential interactions between star formation , recycling from stellar evolutionary processes , ism processes of heating and ionization , recombination , cooling and molecule formation , together with infall from the igm , and outflow of ism material .",
    "most of this complexity is concealed within the replenishment factor @xmath22 .",
    "one issue is that stellar winds and sne contribute to all components of the ism rather than solely to @xmath8 . in a",
    " galactic fountain \" @xcite , infalling gas will contribute to , and outflowing gas will strip from , all components . if recycled gas includes a component that never subsequently forms stars ( such as some recycled gas in the ionized phase being ejected from the galaxy before contributing to star formation ) ,",
    "the factor @xmath20 in equation  ( [ theeqn ] ) will be reduced , and @xmath22 will need to be increased to compensate .",
    "our quantitative results strongly depend on the assumed gas outflow rate .",
    "variations by a factor of two or so in either direction will still result in a constant or slowly varying hi mass density , as long as a proportionality with the sfr of the host galaxies remains ( as suggested by * ? ? ?",
    "the chosen outflow rate is an effective average over all star forming galaxies , and is consistent with observed trends ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while individual galaxies show a large observed scatter between outflow rates and sfrs , for the ensemble properties of the total population this assumption should be robust",
    "the proposed replenishment through the supershell mechanism is not inconsistent with some simultaneous replenishment through infall .",
    "metallicity considerations , which we do not address here , do require infall of some low metallicity gas @xcite , and gas infall in local galaxies is well established ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the observed infall rate is insufficient to match consumption .",
    "we have identified a possible resolution to the puzzle of why the hi mass density of the universe evolves so little for so much of cosmic history .",
    "we propose that replenishment is driven by supershells associated with star forming complexes in galaxies .",
    "pre - existing ionized gas efficiently cools and recombines in supershell walls .",
    "molecular gas forms _ in situ _ in shell walls , and molecular material is compressed to trigger cloud collapse and star formation .",
    "this mechanism provides a natural explanation for replenishment that has the desired proportionality to the sn rate .",
    "the level of replenishment observed in a galactic supershell @xcite appears more than sufficient to provide the required replenishment rate of @xmath45 per sn event .",
    "the factor of two decline in the hi density between @xmath2 and @xmath55 could be explained through either ( 1 ) a replenishment rate that is marginally lower than that required to exactly balance gas consumption ; or ( 2 ) the inability of low - mass galaxies , which dominate the star formation history in this epoch , to retain their newly formed hi ; or , perhaps more likely , a combination of both .",
