    "in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , dust grains are the most efficient absorber of stellar light .",
    "the spectral energy distributions and the radiative heating and cooling in galaxies are thus strongly regulated by the presence of dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this means that the understanding of dust enrichment in galaxies is crucial in the studies of galaxy evolution .",
    "dust enrichment in galaxies is governed by various processes depending on age , metallicity , etc.@xcite . in the earliest stage of galaxy evolution",
    ", dust is predominantly produced by supernovae ( sne ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while at later epochs asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars also contribute @xcite .",
    "the time - scale of dust destruction by sn shocks is @xmath2  yr @xcite , while that of dust supply from stellar sources is longer than 1 gyr in the milky way @xcite .",
    "therefore , dust grains should grow in the ism by the accretion of metals onto grains @xcite to explain the existence of dust in the ism .",
    "the growth occurs most efficiently in molecular clouds , where the typical number density of hydrogen molecules is @xmath3 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this process is called ` grain growth in clouds ' in this paper .",
    "observational pieces of evidence for the grain growth in clouds come from larger depletion of metal elements in cold clouds than in warm medium @xcite .",
    "a lot of chemical evolution models treat the evolution of dust content in galaxies .",
    "these models usually include dust production by stars , grain growth in clouds , and dust destruction by sne ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of the models which consider the grain growth in clouds indicate that this process dominates the dust budget at sub - solar or solar metallicities .",
    "the grain growth occurs through the accretion of metals , so that the increasing rate of grain mass by the accretion of metals is proportional not only to the metallicity but also to the grain surface - to - volume ratio , which is very sensitive to the grain size distribution .",
    "most models so far assume a certain grain size distribution or a typical grain size to estimate the surface - to - volume ratio .",
    "however , since the dominant processes governing the grain size distribution should vary with age and metallicity @xcite , it is expected that a variety of grain size distributions emerge in a complex way depending on age and metallicity .",
    "the first source of dust in the history of galaxy evolution is sne , and the dust grains produced by sne are possibly biased to large ( @xmath5 ) sizes because small grains tend to be destroyed in the shocked region within sne before being injected into the interstellar space @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that small grains are produced by shattering driven by interstellar turbulence if the dust abundance is as high as that expected from the solar metallicity .",
    "@xcite show that shattering in interstellar sn shocks increases the abundance of small grains .",
    "efficient production of small grains enhances the surface - to - volume ratio , activating the grain growth by the accretion of metals .",
    "thus , we should consider various grain size distributions depending on galaxy age and metallicity , and the grain growth efficiency may vary with a variety of grain size distributions .",
    "the first aim of this paper is to formulate the grain growth in clouds by explicitly considering the dependence on grain size distribution .",
    "therefore , the former part of this paper is devoted to the formulation of the grain growth in clouds under an arbitrary grain size distribution .",
    "then , by using this formulation , we point out the importance of grain size distribution for the grain growth by accretion .",
    "the final scope of this work is to examine if the grain size distribution has a significant influence on the dust enrichment in galaxies through the grain growth in clouds .",
    "thus , in the latter part of this paper , we implement our formulation of the grain growth in clouds into a simple framework of dust enrichment in a galaxy , also taking into account the grain formation by stellar sources and the destruction by interstellar shocks driven by sn remnants .",
    "thereby , we will show that our formulation of dust growth is successfully incorporated into dust enrichment models , and we will address the importance of grain size distribution for the grain mass budget in galaxies .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we explain the formulation in section [ sec : formula ] , and describe some basic results on the evolution of grain size distribution through the grain growth in individual clouds in section [ sec : result ] .",
    "we implement the results for the grain growth in clouds into a simple evolution model of dust mass in an entire galactic system in section [ sec : timescale ] , where the model also treats the dust formation by stellar sources and the dust destruction by sn shocks .",
    "we discuss the results in more general contexts in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] gives the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we formulate the evolution of grain size distribution by the accretion of metals ( grain growth ) in a single interstellar cloud . our procedures in this paper are divided into the following two steps : ( i ) we construct a formulation of the grain growth in clouds , which is conveniently incorporated in any dust evolution models in galaxies ; and ( ii ) we show that our formulation in this section can be used generally to treat the grain growth in galaxies .",
    "this section is aimed at item ( i ) . in section [ sec : timescale ] , we address item ( ii ) by incorporating our formulation for the grain growth into simple dust enrichment models which also include dust formation by stellar sources and dust destruction in sn shocks . other mechanisms that modify the grain size distribution such as shattering and coagulation are treated in other papers @xcite . these processes",
    "are to be included in future work for the comprehensive understanding of the evolution of grain size distribution .    throughout this paper",
    ", we call the elements composing grains ` metals ' .",
    "we only treat grains refractory enough to survive after the dispersal of the cloud , and do not consider volatile grains such as water ice .",
    "more specifically , we consider silicate and graphite as main dust components .",
    "we also assume that the grains are spherical with a constant material density @xmath6 , so that the grain mass @xmath7 and the grain radius @xmath8 are related as @xmath9      we define the grain size distribution such that @xmath10 is the number density of grains whose radii are between @xmath8 and @xmath11 at time @xmath12 . for simplicity , we assume that the gas density is constant and the evolution of grain size distribution occurs only through the accretion of metals on dust grains . in this situation ,",
    "the number density of grains is conserved .",
    "thus , the following continuity equation in terms of @xmath13 holds : @xmath14 = 0 , \\label{eq : continuity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the growth rate of the grain radius and is given in the next subsection .",
    "coagulation and shattering , which do not conserve the number density of grains , are not treated to focus on the grain growth by accretion here .",
    "note that these processes do not change the grain mass , while the grain growth by accretion increases it .",
    "the evolution of grain size distribution by coagulation and shattering is treated in other papers @xcite .",
    "we also neglect possible grain destruction mechanisms in molecular clouds by cosmic rays or shocks .",
    "the grain growth rate is basically determined by the collision rate between a grain and particles of the relevant metal species .",
    "we adopt silicate and graphite as dominant grain species ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and denote elements composing the grains as x ( for example , x = c , si , etc . ) .",
    "we neglect the effect of coulomb interaction on the cross section ( i.e.  the cross section of a grain for accretion of metals is simply estimated by the geometric one ) because the grains and the atoms are neutral in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "in fact , the ionization degree in dense clouds is @xmath16 @xcite , which means that almost all the metal atoms colliding with the dust grains are neutral .",
    "the rate at which atoms of element x strike the surface of a grain with radius @xmath8 is denoted as @xmath17 and is estimated as @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number density of element x , @xmath20 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath21 is the gas temperature , and @xmath22 is the atom mass of element x. in general , dust grains are not composed of a single species .",
    "we adopt a key element , whose mass fraction in the grain material is @xmath23 , and represent the grain growth by the accretion of element x. the concept of key element is also adopted by @xcite .    by using @xmath23 , the increase of the grain mass @xmath7",
    "is estimated as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the sticking probability .",
    "this equation is converted into the increasing rate of @xmath8 by using equations ( [ eq : mass ] ) and ( [ eq : collision ] ) as @xmath26 in fact , @xmath27 is a function of time because the metal abundance in gas phase decreases as the dust grains grow .",
    "this effect is treated in the next subsection .",
    "the decreasing rate of the number density of element x in gas phase is equal to the grain growth rate per volume : @xmath28 now we introduce the @xmath29-th moment of @xmath8 as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number density of dust grains , which is independent of @xmath12 : @xmath32 the moments are functions of @xmath12 , and their values at @xmath33 are denoted as @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) . by using the second moment of @xmath8 and equation ( [ eq : collision ] ) for @xmath17 , equation ( [ eq : depletion ] ) can be expressed as @xmath36    note that the third moment of @xmath8 is related to the dust mass density @xmath37 as @xmath38 the initial dust mass density is @xmath39 .",
    "here we quantify the initial number density of element x. the total number density of element x both in gas and dust phases is written as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the metallicity , and ( x / h)@xmath42 is the solar abundance relative to hydrogen in number , and @xmath43 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei . we denote the initial fraction of element x in gas phase as @xmath44 : @xmath45 since the initial number density of element x in dust phase is @xmath46 , @xmath47 by using equation ( [ eq : rho_d ] ) at @xmath33 , equation ( [ eq : metallicity ] ) is written as @xmath48 thus , the normalization of the grain size distribution is determined by @xmath49 where we used equation ( [ eq : nxtot ] ) for @xmath50 .",
    "the most important characteristics of the grain growth by accretion is that the increasing rate of @xmath8 is independent of @xmath8 ( equation [ eq : dadt ] ) .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : continuity ] ) gives a formal solution as @xmath51 where @xmath52 @xmath53 is obtained if we give @xmath27 by using equation ( [ eq : dndt ] ) .",
    "we formally assume that @xmath54 for @xmath55 so that equation ( [ eq : formal ] ) can be used even for @xmath56 .",
    "we introduce the following indicator for the dust mass increase in the cloud ( equation [ eq : rho_d ] ) : @xmath57 where we expand the third moment by using equation ( [ eq : formal ] ) .",
    "note that the dust mass in the cloud at @xmath12 is @xmath58 times the initial dust mass .",
    "a similar equation is also obtained for the grain mantle growth as shown by @xcite .      for numerical calculations and interpretations of the results , introducing a typical time - scale",
    "is convenient .",
    "the typical time - scale of grain growth by accretion is defined by @xmath59\\right .",
    ", \\label{eq : tau}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is a typical grain radius given arbitrarily . by using @xmath61 , equation ( [ eq : a ] )",
    "is reduced to @xmath62 while equation ( [ eq : dndt ] ) is written as @xmath63 where we have used equation ( [ eq:1-xi ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath64 a set of equations ( [ eq : a_final])([eq : a2_expansion ] ) is solved to obtain the grain growth @xmath53 .",
    "we consider silicate and graphite as representative grain components @xcite . in order to avoid the complexity arising from compound species ,",
    "we treat those two species separately as a first approximation .",
    "the quantities adopted in this paper are summarized in table [ tab : material ] .",
    ".adopted quantities . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath65 grain size distribution : `` p '' for the power law and `` @xmath66 '' for the @xmath66 function .     by an analysis of infrared dust emission spectra , @xcite",
    "show that the grain size distributions of some metal - poor dwarf galaxies are biased toward smaller grains compared with the galactic case ( i.e.  @xmath67 ) .",
    "therefore , the critical metallicity for these dwarf galaxies is expected to be lower than their metallicities : in other words , the grain growth in clouds is expected to contribute significantly to the dust abundance in these galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to point out that @xmath68 explains the data points of metal - poor galaxies better than @xmath69 .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite s conclusion that the grain size distribution is biased to small sizes .    after the grain growth , all the lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : dg_metal ] and [ fig : dg_metal_fin0.01 ] finally converge .",
    "this is explained as follows .",
    "if the metallicity is high enough , the grain growth is regulated by the lifetime of clouds and is independent of grain size distribution .",
    "in other words , @xmath70 if the metallicity becomes high enough ( i.e.  @xmath71 is large enough in equation [ eq : beta_approx ] ) . using @xmath72 and equation ( [ eq : dddz_final ] )",
    ", we obtain the following estimate in the case where the grain growth dominates the increase of the dust content : @xmath73 which is valid for @xmath74 ( we only adopt the dominant terms ) . therefore",
    ", if @xmath44 is so small ( large ) that the right - hand side of this equation is positive ( negative ) , @xmath44 tends to increase ( decrease ) as @xmath41 increases .",
    "this means that @xmath44 tends to approach the value that makes the right - hand side to be zero ; that is , @xmath75 for the values adopted in our models ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , @xmath78 .",
    "this means that the fraction of metals in dust phase is about 0.5 at metallicities much higher than the critical metallicity .",
    "if we consider the uncertainty in @xmath79 by a factor of 2 because of material difference @xcite , @xmath800.66 .",
    "it is interesting that @xmath44 at @xmath81 only depends on @xmath82 . using the definition of @xmath83 ( below equation [ eq : tausn ] ) and equation ( [ eq : sfr ] ) , we obtain @xmath84 this is the ratio between the gas mass swept by sn shocks per unit time multiplied by the efficiency of dust destruction in sn shocks , and the formation rate of clouds . in other words , this is the ratio between the dust destruction rate by sn shocks and the grain growth rate in clouds .",
    "therefore , it is natural that the final fraction of metals in dust phase can be described by the balance between the dust destruction by sn shocks and the dust formation in clouds .",
    "@xcite also obtained a similar expression for the critical metallicity .",
    "we have confirmed his conclusion that the dust - to - metal ratio approaches a constant value : this behaviour is called self - regulation by @xcite . the difference between our formulation and",
    "his is that he treated @xmath85 as a parameter independent of @xmath86 while we connect these two parameters through the star formation efficiency @xmath87 .",
    "since both star formation and grain growth occur in molecular clouds , these two processes are not independent . moreover ,",
    "if the grain growth is efficient enough , the dust growth time - scale is limited by the lifetime of clouds , which is independent of the grain size distribution .",
    "therefore , the dust - to - metal ratio does not depend on the grain size distribution for @xmath81 , and it depends only on @xmath82 .",
    "the first dust should be produced by sne in the death of massive stars .",
    "because of shock destruction in sne , the dust sizes may be biased to @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that shattering driven by interstellar turbulence can produce small grains efficiently if the metallicity becomes higher than a critical value ( @xmath891 z@xmath42 ) .",
    "thus , the critical metallicity for the grain growth is near the metallicity level where shattering produces small grains efficiently .",
    "the production of small grains accelerates the grain growth by accretion , which raises the grain abundance . with the increased dust abundance ,",
    "shattering can be further efficient , although the produced small grains by shattering does not necessarily activate further shattering of large grains @xcite . such an interplay between shattering and accretion",
    "may be interesting to investigate in the future .",
    "the size distribution of grains produced by agb stars is also important since agb stars become the dominant dust production source after several hundreds of myr @xcite .",
    "the size of grains produced in agb stars is suggested to be large ( @xmath90 ) from the observations of spectral energy distributions @xcite , although @xcite show that the grains are not single - sized . to clarify",
    "the grain size distribution formed by agb stars is important for the efficiency of grain growth .",
    "shattering in the ism may also play a role in efficiently producing small grains even if agb stars only produce large grains @xcite . in this case , efficient grain growth can occur .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the critical metallicity is within the metallicity range typical of dwarf galaxies ( table [ tab : zcr ] ) .",
    "this confirms the conclusion by @xcite that the strong metallicity dependence of the dust - to - gas ratio in dwarf galaxies can be explained by the grain growth in clouds .",
    "the grain growth is also important in some high - redshift galaxy populations .",
    "in fact , high - redshift quasars have solar ( or more ) metallicities ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , which implies that the grain growth is indeed governing the dust abundance in distant quasars @xcite ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "if the abundance of small grains are enhanced because of shattering as suggested by @xcite , the critical metallicity becomes lower , so that the importance of grain growth in clouds is further pronounced .",
    "qualitatively it may be predicted that the mid - infrared emission from very small grains is relatively suppressed if the grain growth in clouds is activated .",
    "however , it is hard to quantitatively predict the galaxy - scale observational features caused by the grain growth in clouds because it is difficult to selectively see the clouds , where grain growth is occurring . since observations of galactic spectral energy distribution inevitably include the emission from diffuse medium , other mechanisms modifying the grain size distribution such as shattering and coagulation are also reflected in the observed emission from grains . indeed ,",
    "@xcite show that the grain size distribution is biased toward smaller grains in some dwarf galaxies , which may be interpreted as the efficient grain processing in diffuse medium .",
    "they also demonstrate that there is a variety in the grain size distribution among dwarf galaxies .",
    "such a variety will be investigated in the future with a consistent treatment of a nonlinear combination between the small grain production by shattering and sputtering and the grain growth by accretion and coagulation .",
    "we have formulated and investigated the grain growth rate by accretion in interstellar clouds .",
    "the formalism is applicable to any grain size distribution .",
    "we have found that the grain size distribution is really fundamental in regulating the grain growth rate .",
    "we have also implemented the formulation of grain growth in individual clouds into the chemical evolution models of entire galaxies .",
    "the models also treat dust supply from stellar sources and dust destruction by sn shocks , but we have focused particularly on the grain growth in clouds in this paper .",
    "we have found that the metallicity level where the grain growth in clouds becomes dominant strongly depends on the grain size distribution .",
    "if the significant fraction of the grains have radii @xmath91 or the grain size distribution is described as power law with @xmath92 , the large grain abundance at the sub - solar metallicity level is naturally explained by the grain growth in clouds because the surface - to - volume ratio of the grains is large enough .",
    "the grain growth should be efficient in galaxies whose metallicity is above @xmath93 estimated in section [ subsec : zcr ] .",
    "our formulation for the grain growth is applicable to any grain size distribution and is implemented straightforwardly into any framework of chemical enrichment models .",

    "<S> grain growth by the accretion of metals in interstellar clouds ( called ` grain growth ' ) could be one of the dominant processes that determine the dust content in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of grain size distribution for the grain growth is demonstrated in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> first , we derive an analytical formula that gives the grain size distribution after the grain growth in individual clouds for any initial grain size distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the time - scale of the grain growth is very sensitive to grain size distribution , since the grain growth is mainly regulated by the surface to volume ratio of grains . </S>",
    "<S> next , we implement the results of grain growth into dust enrichment models of entire galactic system along with the grain formation and destruction in the interstellar medium , finding that the grain growth in clouds governs the dust content in nearby galaxies _ unless _ the grain size is strongly biased to sizes larger than @xmath0 or the power index of the grain size distribution is shallower than @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the grain growth in clouds contributes to the rapid increase of dust - to - gas ratio at a certain metallicity level ( called critical metallicity in @xcite and @xcite ) , which we find to be sensitive to grain size distribution . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the grain growth efficiently increase the dust mass not only in nearby galaxies but also in high - redshift quasars , whose metallicities are larger than the critical value . </S>",
