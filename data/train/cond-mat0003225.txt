    "the long - standing and still controversial problem of quantum measurements @xcite is gradually becoming a practical issue due to the development of experimental techniques capable of measurements at the quantum border ( see , e.g.  refs .",
    "the renewed interest in this subject is caused by the needs of quantum computing,@xcite since the measurement of an entangled and possibly evolving quantum state by a realistic detector in a realistic environment presents a nontrivial problem .    despite the experimental proof @xcite of the violation of bell s inequality @xcite that rejects the idea of hidden variables , the origin of the randomness of a quantum measurement result ( the problem known as the `` wavefunction collapse '' ) remains controversial .",
    "important insight into this problem has been provided by the development of the theory of continuous quantum measurement , which generalizes the `` orthodox '' case @xcite of instantaneous measurement .",
    "there are two different theoretical approaches . in the first approach @xcite based on the theory of interaction with a dissipative environment , @xcite the evolution of the density matrix of the measured system",
    "is _ averaged _ over a complete _ ensemble _ of measurements , thus leading to the deterministic equation .",
    "this is the best - known approach , at least in the solid - state community , and so can be called `` conventional '' . the other approach @xcite ( more developed in quantum optics ) studies the random evolution of the quantum state during a _ single _ realization of the measurement , so that this evolution is conditioned on ( selected by ) the particular measurement result .",
    "recently @xcite the latter approach has been introduced into the context of solid - state physics using the new derivation based on the simple bayesian analysis of probabilities .    in the present paper",
    "this bayesian formalism is applied to the calculation of the spectral density of the detector current when a two - level quantum system ( qubit ) is measured continuously . as a particular example , we consider a double - quantum - dot occupied by one electron , the location of which is measured by a quantum point contact nearby.@xcite another example of the setup is a single - cooper - pair box , being measured by a single - electron transistor.@xcite one more possible example is the continuous measurement of two flux states of a squid by another inductively coupled squid.@xcite    we show that in the weak - coupling case when the quantum ( rabi ) oscillations of the qubit state are only slightly perturbed by the detector , the corresponding peak in the spectral density of the detector current can be up to 4 times higher than the noise pedestal ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as the coupling increases ,",
    "the quantum zeno effect @xcite becomes significant leading to the lorentzian shape of the spectral density centered at zero frequency .",
    "it is important to notice that there should be no difference between the predictions of the conventional approach and the approach of selective evolution unless the measurement result affects the system evolution ( for example , via the feedback loop ) .",
    "we prove this equivalence explicitly for the detector spectral density ( if there is no feedback ) . despite the same final result ,",
    "the interpretations are different : in the bayesian formalism a significant contribution to the spectrum comes from the correlation between the detector noise and the system evolution , while this correlation is absent in the conventional approach . in the paper",
    "we also discuss the extension of the bayesian formalism to the case of additional weak interaction of the two - level system with a finite - temperature environment.@xcite",
    "for a two - level quantum system described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is the energy asymmetry and @xmath2 is the tunneling strength ) the evolution of its density matrix @xmath3 due to continuous measurement is given in the conventional approach @xcite by the equations @xmath4 where the dephasing rate @xmath5 due to measurement depends on the type of the detector used .",
