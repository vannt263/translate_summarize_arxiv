    "the well known galton - watson ( gw ) process @xcite investigates the extinction of surnames which propagate from father to son .",
    "we consider here a model which unlike the gw model depends on both parents , namely the offspring of a known personality which propagates through father or mother to their children and we ask for the ratio of the descendants to the total population . as an example we will consider the offspring of king david .    king david lived about 3,000 years ago .",
    "we assume that a generation ( from birth until marriage and children ) is 25 years , and each married couple has @xmath11 children , where @xmath12 is the growth factor per generation .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the number of israelites at the @xmath2th generation and @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the number of descendants ( male and female ) of king david at the @xmath2th generation and @xmath17 denote the non - descendants .",
    "we start at the first generation with @xmath18 , the dynasty founder .",
    "our problem is to estimate the ratio @xmath19 after @xmath20 generations .",
    "this will show , in particular , that practically all israelites today are descendants .",
    "it is possible that a family disappears after a few generations ( discussed in section 6 ) , but we assume throughout the paper that it does nt happen . in our example with what we know about king david and his son solomon",
    ", we do not have to worry about that .",
    "however if we are not sure about that we can say , as we discuss later , that _ either all israelites are his descendant or none_. therefore if there is one descendant then all are descendants .    it will be shown that for a population of @xmath5 it took @xmath21 generations to make half the population descendants of king david .",
    "additional four generations made all of them his descendants .",
    "that is the dad full spreading time .",
    "the transitions region between low to high spreading ratio is very quick , a few generations .",
    "it is not only king david ; the same relation exists regarding anyone else of his era ( or any other early era ) whose family survived in the first few generations ( discussed in section 6 ) , including for example less admirable characters in the bible like nabal ... assuming a population between @xmath8 and @xmath22 israelites at king david s time ( @xmath10 bc ) @xcite , it took 24 to 26 generations ( 600 - 650 years , when taking 25 years for a generation ) to ensure that every israelite was his descendant .",
    "that means that every israelite living at 400 bc , the beginning of the era of the second temple in jerusalem , was already a descendant of king david .",
    "an interesting feature of the dad route is that the descendant population ratio and the spreading time depend on @xmath5 but not on the population growth factor @xmath12 even if @xmath12 is generation dependent .",
    "two presentations of the same result are given .",
    "[ [ the - first - presentation ] ] the first presentation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    let @xmath13 be the total number of males and females at the @xmath2th generation of a certain community , and among them @xmath23 ( davidian ) descendants of the dynasty we follow .",
    "the number of males and females are assumed equal .",
    "further assume that we have @xmath25 cards with all the female names , one name per card , and similarly in another box @xmath25 cards for all the males .",
    "consider now a `` match maker '' picking up randomly and independently one card from each box , and combining them to a single card ( marriage ) with the two names on it . at this stage",
    "add to each of the two names information whether he ( she ) is or is nt a d - descendant .",
    "throw away all cards where both names are non - descendants .",
    "the probability that a descendant married a descendant is @xmath26 and for a descendant marrying a non - descendant it is @xmath27 .    the conditional expectation @xmath28 ( the number of descendants at the @xmath3th generation conditioned on @xmath16 , the number of descendants at the @xmath2th generation ) follows from the fact that for @xmath29 a married couple who are both descendants will have 2 descendants . in this case",
    "the number of descendants will not change . on the other had if a descendant married a non - descendant the one descendant in the @xmath2th generation will generate two descendants for the @xmath3th generation .    therefore , @xmath30 \\cdot \\tilde{d}_n + 2 g \\cdot \\left [ \\begin{array}{l } \\text{the probability that } \\\\",

    "we also comment that this statistical model can be viewed as a random walk process , as discussed below in section 3 .",
    "we can simplify the analysis by a simple renormalization procedure that shows right away that the dad route is independent of the growth factor @xmath12 .",
    "we normalize by setting : @xmath31 and then with @xmath32 we obtain from eq .",
    "@xmath33 the growth factor @xmath12 is eliminated and therefore @xmath5 is the only relevant quantity",
    ". not only that , but the free of @xmath12 property holds for the general case where @xmath12 depends on @xmath20 and then @xmath34 is the growth factor from the generation @xmath20 to @xmath3 . to realize that , we replace in the former procedure : @xmath35 then @xmath36 .",
    "usually @xmath37 , but at least we need for the first few generations @xmath38 to avoid extinction of @xmath39 ( discussed in section 6 ) , and for later generations @xmath34 to be bounded away from zero . with the normalization : @xmath40 eq . with @xmath41",
    "transforms to eq . which is free of all @xmath34 .",
    "in section 3 we view this statistical process as a simple random walk model .",
    "we will show that @xmath42 , and therefore the recursive eq . can be written as : @xmath43    [ [ the - second - presentation ] ] the second presentation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we split the population into males and females , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 where `` m '' and `` f '' stand respectively for male and female for the @xmath39 ( dvidians ) and the rest @xmath47 .    we continue to use the normalized population numbers @xmath39 , @xmath48 and @xmath5 eliminating @xmath12 from the equations since it does nt affect the distribution .",
    "then the normalized population ratios are : @xmath49    now we sort the couple types and count them with their probabilities .",
    "( one can envision it again by the two card boxes described above or by a roulette wheel procedure : the @xmath50 and @xmath51 are randomly marked in the cycling wheel and the @xmath52 and @xmath53 are randomly marked in the stationary platform . )",
    "the couple types and their probabilities are : @xmath54    the first three types give for each couple two d - children , and the fourth one gives zero d - children , giving altogether for the next generation : @xmath55 which is the same equation as eq . .",
    "* upper bound estimate : *    we would have liked to solve recursively for @xmath56 up to @xmath57 .",
    "this however can not be done since : @xmath58 and hence ( jensen s inequality ) @xmath59 the same holds for conditional expectations . then by eq .",
    ": @xmath60 therefore , we can solve recursively the equation : @xmath61 but the solution will be an _ upper bound _ to the solution of for @xmath56 .    in the next section we will show that @xmath62 is a very good approximation to @xmath63 and consequently eq . will be a very good approximation for @xmath64 .",
    "we wish to evaluate the standard deviation of our statistical process at the @xmath20th generation that leads to the descendant population of the @xmath3 generation .",
    "it is needed for evaluating eq . , and for that we apply a random walk model @xcite .",
    "consider the unordered collection of the pairs of cards described in section 2 , but without those cards where both couple members are non - descendants .",
    "it will yield @xmath39 pairs . next arrange these @xmath39 pairs randomly and independently as a sequence running from 1 to @xmath39 .",
    "let @xmath66 denote this sequence .",
    "card @xmath67 can have on it a pair of davidians or one davidian and one non - davidian .",
    "set @xmath68 in case that a davidian married a non = davidian and @xmath69 if davidian married a davidian .",
    "the sequence @xmath70 constitutes a random walk process of @xmath39 moves with a probability @xmath71 to make 1 step ( @xmath72 1 d descendants ) , and a probability @xmath73 to make 2 steps ( @xmath722 non - d descendants ) .",
    "the total average distance of the walk gives of next generation davidian descendants @xmath74 , given by eq . .",
    "a similar procedure can be attributed for @xmath75 ( successive years difference ) obtained from eq .",

    "it should be noted that the accumulated error in the recursive process along @xmath20 ( in our cases @xmath91 ) , is negligible since the relative error we found for a step in @xmath20 is very small , of the order of @xmath92 ( for any @xmath20 ) , and @xmath93 .",
    "we give below examples with plots of the descendant population ratio @xmath94 along the generation number , given by the exact solution of the recursive equation : @xmath95 .",
    "the plots in fig .  1",

    "we need @xmath100 more generations . thus even for a population of @xmath101 it takes only @xmath102 generations ( 850 years ) to the dad full spreading time .     vs. @xmath20 , obtained from the recursive equation - eq . , for various starting population numbers : @xmath103 and @xmath104 , ( corresponding to plots from left to right , respectively )",

    "obtained from : ( a ) the recursive equation , and the approximations ( b ) eq . , and ( c ) eq . ]    .",
    "our model uses a growth factor that can vary from generation to generation , but takes a fixed average number of children of @xmath120 per family for the whole population .",
    "the overall dad model that we presented gives an accurate description of the descendant distribution , but as we said , it needs attention to the first few generations .",
    "then , when the dynasty starts to build up ( @xmath39 is a small number ) it has fragility features just as the galton - watson ( gw ) process @xcite .",
    "the gw process was presented to find the stability and the extinction of surnames ( or families ) that is dependent on the average number of sons ( or children ) per family .",
    "we already mentioned that we need @xmath121 , just as in the gw process , to eliminate the possibility for the d extinction .",
    "however even for larger @xmath12 there is a certain nonzero probability that a dynasty disappears .",
    "we need for that the probabilities for the various number of children per two parents that includes a finite probability for having no children .",
    "the zero children probability causes the extinction .",
    "we give here a brief analysis that basically follows the gw process .    for a poissonic distribution",
    "the probability for the number of children @xmath122 per family is @xmath123 .",
    "for example , for @xmath124 : @xmath125 , and @xmath126 .",
    "it is easy to realize that most of the extinction probability comes from a descendant chain of successive families along the generation line @xmath20 , each with one child , terminated by a zero children family .",
    "the probability for that is the sum of the geometric series @xmath127=0.185 .",
    "for @xmath128 the sum is @xmath129 .",
    "we will see below that these numbers are very close to the results obtained by the gw calculation . in the gw process for poissonic offspring distribution",
    ", the extinction probability can be obtained from the probability generating function @xcite : @xmath130 and the survival probability @xmath131 is given by : @xmath132 for @xmath133 this recursion levels off to zero ( i.e. family extinction ) .",
    "for @xmath134 it levels off to a nonzero value given by the nontrival fixed point of eq .",
    ": one of the two roots of @xmath135 .",
    "the trivial fixed point is always @xmath136 , and the second one @xmath137 , that depends on @xmath138 , gives the survival probability .",
    "[ when starting the recursion at @xmath139 it gives for this process the evolution along @xmath20 of the descendant population ratio that asymptotically reaches @xmath137 . ] for @xmath140 children per family , the survival ratio is @xmath141 ( extinction ratio of @xmath142 ) . for @xmath143 ,",
    "the survival ratio is @xmath144 ( extinction ratio of @xmath145 ) and for @xmath146 it is @xmath147 ( extinction ratio of @xmath148 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath138 can vary along the time and from place to place ; the long term global population growth factor , however , is not much higher than @xmath29 . for @xmath149 , i.e. @xmath150 , the global family survival ratio is @xmath151 .",
    "the conclusion is that a certain fraction @xmath152 of the population at the @xmath153 generation will eventually have no descendants .",
    "the extinction that can occur in the first few generations is related to the gw process .",
    "we note what is discussed in the next section , that the extinction part does nt affect the basic dad process that is governed by the average @xmath12 for those ( the most ) who survive .",
    "nevertheless , it means about being a descendant of king david ( or of anybody else ) that : _ either all israelites are his descendant or there is nt even a single descendant ; _ or : _ if there is for sure one descendant , then the whole population are descendants_. we said that for a moderate population growth the extinction part is @xmath154 , meaning that there are no descendants for that fraction of the ancestors population .",
    "nevertheless , as we said in the introduction , it is very likely that king david s dynasty survived the first few generations and then the dad process ensured that they fully spread to the whole population .",
    "our model was constructed by going from an ancestor to his descendants and thus look at the descendant distribution .",
    "then it is possible to follow the path down from generation to generation , but the number of children per couple can vary and have some average value of @xmath11 . the galton - watson ( gw ) process @xcite is an example to such analysis .",
    "we note the basic difference between the gw process and ours .",
    "the dad process depends on the question to whom a davidian is married .",
    "a non - davidian mate contributes @xmath155 children per two parents , while an intra tribe marriage ( davidian to davidian ) gives only half of it , @xmath156 children . in the gw like process",
    "this question is irrelevant .",
    "its focus is on the distribution of the number of children per family that affect the descendant statistics , but it does nt include the interplay between intra and inter tribe marriage . therefore the gw process is relevant in the dad analysis in the first generations only to understand the fragility and extinction . at that stage",
    "the dad process is anyhow similar to the gw one since the probability for a non - davidian mate is almost @xmath157 .",
    "this is the reason why we could use in section 6 the gw analysis for evaluating the survival ratio .",
    "it is also possible to go along the opposite direction from a descendant back in time to his ancestors .",
    "then the route follows the ancestors distribution rather than the descendants . the backward way is more common because of the simplicity to track genealogical family trees of more recent generations , and since then in the analysis the number of parents is a fixed value of 2 .",
    "nevertheless the different backward trajectories that can pass through the same ancestors have probabilistic aspects .",
    "this viewpoint alludes on another aspect , the number of paths that connect a descendant at the @xmath2th generation to a specific ancestor .",
    "this issue depends on the growth factor and the degrees of inter versus intra community mobility .",
    "it is more likely that the connection path number is significantly higher within communities with a common social - geographic history .",
    "derrida et al .",
    "@xcite took the backward direction analysis and obtained much understanding on various sides of the process .",
    "we mention here only one of their results on the population ratio of ancestors at a backward generations given in refs .",
    "the result there is related to the gw process giving for the non - ancestors population ratio at a backward generation @xmath67 the recursive equation : @xmath158 . for the ancestor ratio @xmath159 ,",
    "it becomes @xmath160 ( dependent on @xmath138 or @xmath12 ) , which is equivalent to eq . of the gw process ,",
    "and so it differs from our approach .",
    "we have presented a model for the distribution of descendants along generations , the dad route . the descendant population and the ratio",
    "are given by the recursive equations and .",
    "the descendant ratio , given for a few examples in figure 1 , is shown to reach 1 in a relatively few generations . for an initial population of @xmath5",
    "the dad full spreading time is @xmath161 , that gives about 20 generations ( 500 years ) for @xmath162 .",
    "every additional factor of @xmath99 in @xmath5 adds @xmath163 generations to the dad full spreading time .",
    "the basic dad route behavior , in particular the descendant population ratio does not depend on the population growth factor @xmath12 , but only on the initial population @xmath5 .",
    "we have not included here any genetic or geo - social - demographic aspects .",
    "it is clear that dad will not spread into and out of very isolated groups .",
    "nevertheless , we saw how quick the spreading process is . for a small group of @xmath164 or",
    "@xmath165 it takes about 14 and 17 generations ( 350 and 425 years ) to reach a full descendant spreading ratio . for all israelites at king s david time it took 24 - 26 generations ( 600 - 650 years ) to make every israelite his descendent .",
    "that therefore happened already at 400 bc , the beginning of the era of the second temple in jerusalem .",
    "even for the whole world population at king s david time ( 1000 bc ) , estimated as @xmath166 , it is but 29.5 generations ( 740 years ) .",
    "segregation of local communities can slow down the process , but only in a limited way for relatively short time .",
    "it would be sufficient that one descendant migrates to another community , say with a similar population number , to make the whole population descendants in a few generations .",
    "therefore more globally one might say that even if mankind started with many adams and eves , it took relatively very short time to consider the whole founder group at any early era , as a common forefather  super dad  of all of us .    for the future",
    ", the dad route means that , assuming a reasonable population mobility , each of us on earth today ( @xmath167 ( beyond the low extinction percentage discussed in section 6 , and assuming that no catastrophic event happens , will be an ancestor of everyone in the world - on earth and beyond ? ) in @xmath168 generations ( @xmath169 900 years ) from now .",
    "can this picture lend a philosophical meaning to what is said about a common forefather of mankind ?",
    "we saw that all of us have common ancestors and eventually we will be ourselves the ancestors of everyone in the future in a relatively short period of time .",
    "they all were our fathers and mothers and they all will be our sons daughters     we finally note that after we first deposited the paper in arxiv , our attention was drawn to the work of derrida et al . on the same subject @xcite .",
