    "although the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) is not well understood , there is several observational evidence of non - spherical explosion , obtained by the imaging of _ very _ nearby sne , e.g. , sn 1987a @xcite and galactic supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "even when the imaging is not possible , the detection of polarization from extragalactic sne @xcite suggests that sne are not spherical .",
    "in addition to these studies , spectroscopy of sne can also give clues of the structure of sn explosion .",
    "for example , emission line profiles in the late time spectra ( @xmath3 1 year , where @xmath4 is the time after the explosion ) reveals the asphericity of the explosion @xcite .",
    "it is well established that a special class of type ic sne days ) are classified as type ic @xcite . ]",
    "are associated with the long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this class of sne is thought to be highly energetic , so called hypernovae ( here defined as sne with ejecta kinetic energy @xmath5 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the asphericity of hypernovae is of great interest related to the nature of grbs .",
    "since grbs are induced by relativistic jets , hypernovae are also thought to be aspherical . however , the large kinetic energy of hypernovae is estimated by the analysis under the spherical symmetry .",
    "no realistic multi - dimensional explosion models have been verified against the observed early phase spectra .    to study the multi - dimensional nature of the sn explosion through the various observational facts , radiative transfer calculations are required to connect observables and hydrodynamics models . in this paper , radiative transfer in sn ejecta",
    "is solved with a multi - dimensional monte - carlo radiative transfer code , ` samurai `  ( supernova multi - dimensional radiative transfer code ) , based on hydrodynamic and nucleosynthetic models of hypernovae .",
    "the results are compared with observations of sn 1998bw , and implications for off - axis hypernovae are discussed .    .",

    "we use the results of multi - dimensional hydrodynamic and nucleosynthetic calculations for sn 1998bw @xcite as input density and element distributions .",
    "figure [ fig : model ] shows the density structure and the distribution of @xmath7ni . since the original models used a he star as a progenitor",

    "is preferentially synthesized along this direction ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] ) . in this paper , an aspherical model with @xmath10 ( a20 ) and a spherical model with @xmath11 ( f50 ) are studied .",
    "they are constructed based on the models with @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we compare the polar - viewed spectra of model a20 with the observed spectra of sn 1998bw . at @xmath13 days ,",
    "the absorptions of , and / in the model are weaker than in sn 1998bw . at @xmath14 days , the and lines become strong , although the - absorption at 7000  8000   is still narrower than in the observed spectrum . in the synthetic polar - viewed spectrum ,",
    "the peaks around 4000 and 4500   are partially suppressed by the high velocity absorption by the extended fe near the jet , while they are strong in the side - viewed spectrum .",
    "the suppression of the peaks is similarly seen in the spectrum of sn 1998bw .",
    "the strengths of the and lines at @xmath13 days can be increased if heavy elements synthesized in the explosion are mixed to outer layers . in sn explosions , rayleigh - taylor",
    "( r - t ) instabilities are expected to occur ( see @xcite for the case of type ic sne ) , which could deliver the newly synthesized elements to higher velocities . in figures [ fig : specd20 ] and [ fig : specd30 ] , synthetic spectra of model a20p0.2 are also shown . in this model , @xmath15 of synthesized material",
    "is assumed to be mixed to the outer layers .",
    "the agreement with the observed spectra becomes better especially at @xmath13 days .",
    "we have presented the detailed simulations of optical radiation with realistic jet - like hypernova models .",
    "the emergent lc and spectra are different for different viewing angles .",
    "the spectral properties are determined by the combination of aspherical abundances and anisotropic ionization states .",
    "although the agreement of the spectra is far from perfect , the spectra of the model with mixing are in qualitative agreement with those of sn 1998bw .",
    "the lc study shows that the kinetic energy of an aspherical model that explains sn 1998bw is @xmath16 , which is less than that of a well - fitting spherical model ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the early phase spectra can also be explained by the model with @xmath16 .",
    "however , it should be noted that the higher kinetic energy than the canonical sne ( @xmath18 ) is still required .",
    "the simulations enable us to predict the radiation from off - axis hypernovae .",
    "the lc viewed off - axis rises more slowly than that of on - axis , and its maximum brightness is fainter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc ] ) .",
    "the spectra viewed off - axis show ( 1 ) a slightly lower absorption velocity , ( 2 ) stronger peaks around 4000 and 4500   ( narrower absorption of fe ) and ( 3 ) a stronger @xmath195890 line .",
    "however , the spectra still show general appearance of `` hypernovae '' or `` broad - line supernovae '' . at later phases ,",
    "off - axis hypernovae would show double - peaked [ ] emission profile @xcite ."
