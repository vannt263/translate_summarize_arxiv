    "galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) play a critical role as templates of evolved stellar populations , functioning as testbeds for stellar evolutionary models . at optical wavelengths , huge advances in our understanding of ggcs have been made via extensive photometric surveys of large samples of ggcs both from space @xcite , and from the ground ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the homogeneity of these databases has facilitated a variety of comparisons between precise photometry and existing evolutionary models ( e.g.  @xcite ; dotter et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter @xcite ; vandenberg et al .",
    "2013 , hereafter @xcite ) .",
    "however , at near - infrared ( near - ir ) wavelengths , such comparisons remain few despite a growing database of observations .",
    "@xcite compared @xmath1 photometry of 6 ggcs ( and the old open cluster ngc 6791 ) to the predictions of the latest victoria - regina models @xcite , finding that the models fail to reproduce the observed morphology of cluster rgbs , at least at lower metallicities . on the other hand ,",
    "the victoria - regina models seem to function well in the near - ir when compared to m4 and ngc 6723 @xcite and the main sequence of ngc 3201 @xcite .",
    "other direct comparisons between near - ir ggc isochrones and photometry were performed by @xcite using then - recent models @xcite and bolometric corrections @xcite , and @xcite compared the observed hb and rgb bump and luminosity function of 47 tuc to @xmath2-enhanced basti models @xcite .",
    "the lack of existing comparisons between isochrones and data in the near - ir is not due to a lack of model predictions , and in fact @xcite tabulate the predicted mean absolute @xmath3 magnitude @xmath4 of cluster hbs as a function of age and metallicity .",
    "however , at ages typical of ggcs ( @xmath510 gyr ) these predictions have never been tested thoroughly as the combination of sufficiently accurate ages and @xmath3-band photometry was lacking .",
    "the systematic observation of ggcs in the near - ir has been undertaken largely by e. valenti and collaborators , yielding a database of near - ir photometry of optically well - studied ggcs , including relations between observed photometric features and metallicity ( @xcite ) in addition to @xcite and @xcite , who undertook similar analyses using photometry from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) .",
    "these studies have since served as a _ de facto _ template for old ( @xmath510 gyr ) stellar populations in the near - ir , and have therefore seen numerous applications .",
    "these include the measurement of photometric distances , reddenings and metallicities for many poorly studied ggcs located towards the galactic bulge @xcite , local group dwarf galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and reddening and metallicity maps of the galactic bulge ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    meanwhile , the proliferation of space - based photometric ggc surveys has yielded homogenous databases of ggc cluster distances , reddenings and ages ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) while high resolution multi - object spectroscopic campaigns have produced detailed chemical abundance studies which include large homogenous ggc abundance databases of @xmath6 $ ] ( carretta et al .  2009a , hereafter @xcite ) as well as light and @xmath2-elements ( e.g *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with the goal of leveraging these improvements together ,",
    "we present near - ir photometry of a sample of optically well - studied ggcs , which we employ to reexamine relations between photometric features and metallicity .",
    "we then compare our observations to the predictions of several sets of evolutionary models in near - infrared colors for the first time .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the observations and data reduction . in section three ,",
    "we present color - magnitude diagrams and empirical fiducial sequences for all of our target clusters .",
    "section four contains a comparison between the observed rgb fiducial sequences and predictions of five sets of evolutionary models , as well as updated calibrations of photometric indices versus cluster metallicity . in section five ,",
    "we present observed magnitudes of the horizontal branch and red giant branch bump , as well as empirical relations between the near - ir absolute magnitude of these features versus cluster metallicity .",
    "section six consists of a discussion of current uncertainties in cluster distance , reddening and metallicity , and their influence on our empirical calibrations , and in the final section we summarize our results .",
    "observations of our 12 target clusters were obtained with the infrared side port imager ( ispi ) mounted on the 4 m blanco telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory .",
    "the hawaii-2 2048@xmath72048 pix detector has 0.305@xmath8/pixel , giving a field of view 10.25 arcmin per side .",
    "imaging was obtained in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 filters over the course of three runs between 2008 and 2010 , with median seeing ranging between 0.8and 1.4 , and a log of the observations is given in table [ logtab ] . in order to mitigate the effects of persistence , saturation , and cosmetic defects , a two - step ( for the 2008 run ) or five - step ( all other runs )",
    "dither pattern was employed for each cluster , where each individual 60s exposure in the dither pattern is comprised of 3 - 12 coadds ( as given in the last two columns of table [ logtab ] ) to optimize dynamic range .",
    "as near - infrared imaging is typically limited by the sky background , which can vary both spatially ( on scales smaller than the detector field of view ) and temporally ( on timescales of minutes ) , careful subtraction of this sky background is critical to mitigating photometric errors .",
    "therefore , each on - target dither sequence for each cluster was intercalated with identical sequences targeted at an offset sky field located about @xmath1115@xmath12 away .",
    "these offset sequences were used to create a combined sky frame corresponding to each on - target sequence .",
    "preprocessing , including the construction of bad pixel masks , bias subtraction , and flat fielding , was accomplished using iraf tasks customized for ispi within the ` cirred ` package .",
    "next , sky subtraction was optimized by using a multi - step iterative procedure : sources are rejected to fit an initial sky background , before median combining and subtracting these individual background frames from the original sky frames to generate more fine - scale sky frames .",
    "these improved sky frames are again median combined and added to the initial background , yielding a final sky frame for each exposure sequence .",
    "the high - order ( @xmath13@xmath14@xmath15@xmath16 ) distortion terms present in ispi images were corrected using the iraf ` ccmap ` and ` mscimage ` tasks by matching many ( typically several hundred ) well - detected sources to 2mass . finally , a low - order background is fit to each sky - subtracted , distortion corrected image to remove any residual large - scale gradients .",

    "[ sharpfig ] for the example of ngc 362 .",
    "there , detections which failed the sharpness cut , plotted in red , are found not only to cluster around bright sources spatially ( as seen in the upper right panel ) , but also have rgb colors which are scattered preferentially blueward due to blending , seen in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) as well as a color histogram of the lower rgb ( bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ sharpfig ] ) .",
    "this effect is discussed , for example , by @xcite , and demonstrates why a fairly stringent sharpness cut is needed despite the loss of some real sources in order to guard against systematic color offsets as a result of photometric blends .",
    "we caution that by electing straightforward self - consistent photometric quality cuts , a small fraction of spurious detections may remain in our final catalogs , although this has a negligible impact on our results since our analyses typically employ stars well above our detection limit , and any remaining spurious detections likely fall well redward of the cluster sequences ( see fig .

    "[ modelsect ] ) , we have chosen to calibrate our instrumental catalogs to the 2mass photometric system .",
    "stars astrometrically matched to 2mass were only used as photometric calibrators if they satisfied a more stringent set of criteria : they must be matched to a 2mass point source to within the astrometric rms ( @xmath210.2@xmath8 ) , isolated ( lacking neighbors within 4 mag inside a 2.5@xmath8 radius , corresponding to a contaminating flux of @xmath212.5% ) and be bright enough to remain unaffected by crowding in 2mass ( see below ) . to calculate transformations from the instrumental magnitudes in our psf catalogs to the 2mass photometric system , we employed classical linear transformation equations of the form @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote instrumental and standard magnitudes respectively .",
    "we solve for the coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 using least squares fitting , but employing weighting factors to downweight discrepant data points in lieu of a sigma clip @xcite , and we apply these same weighting factors to calculate the weighted root mean square deviation ( wrms ) of the residuals . a comparison between the results of our calibration procedure and the magnitudes reported in the 2mass psc are shown in fig .",
    "[ comp2massfig ] , with the wrms given in each plot .",
    "the asymmetry seen at the faint end among stars positionally matched to 2mass is due to the brighter completeness limit and lower spatial resolution of 2mass , resulting in a systematic brightward deviation in 2mass magnitudes .",
    "this effect serves as a cautionary note against calibrating to 2mass in cases where only the faintest 2mass stars are unsaturated , and for this reason we exclude faint 2mass sources ( @xmath2714 depending on stellar density ) from use as photometric calibrators ( see fig .",

    "a.1 and a.2 of @xcite ) , while subsequent observations of ngc 6528 imply lower values and a substantial ( @xmath110.2 dex ) spread in @xmath6 $ ] ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other significant discrepancy in cluster metallicity between @xcite and @xcite is the case of ngc 4833 ( @xmath6$]@xcite=-1.89@xmath290.05 ; @xmath6$]@xcite=-2.4 ) .",
    "recent spectroscopic evidence clarifies the situation to some degree : on one hand , @xcite report @xmath6$]=-2.015@xmath290.09 dex from uves spectra on their @xcite scale , but @xcite find @xmath6$]=-2.25@xmath290.02 from fe i lines and @xmath6$]=-2.19@xmath290.013 from fe ii lines , although they show that the use of different model atmosphere grids and line analysis codes can fully account for the discrepancy between their results and the @xcite value .",
    "fortunately , the aforementioned issues are of little consequence for the results of figs .",

    "our result from sect .",
    "[ hbsect ] that the @xcite models overestimate the hb luminosity for metal - intermediate ( @xmath37\\lesssim$]-0.8 ) rhb clusters is also robust to the choice of distances , reddenings , and ages from @xcite rather than @xcite .",
    "this is due at least partially to the fact that although the absolute ages of @xcite are generally younger than those of @xcite , the _ relative _ ages of our target clusters are unchanged within their quoted uncertainties regardless of which set of _ absolute _ ages one assumes ( see fig .",
    "[ compmmo ] , bottom panel ) .",
    "in fact , the use of distances , reddenings and ages from @xcite rather than @xcite actually increases the discrepancy between observed and predicted @xmath4 at lower metallicities : taking reported age and metallicity uncertainties into account , the shift required to bring observed @xmath62 values into accord with the @xcite models at the 1@xmath17 level is @xmath41@xmath62=-0.15 and -0.17 mag for ngc 362 and ngc 1851 respectively , compared to @xmath41@xmath62=-0.05 and -0.10 mag respectively ( see fig .",

    "however , we recall that the distances and reddenings given by @xcite were determined by assuming the lower envelope of the observed hb as the zahb ( at the high - mass end ) .",
    "this procedure comes with the risk that any dependence on metallicity of the magnitude difference between the model zahb and the _ observed _ lower envelope of the hb ( as discussed extensively , for example , by @xcite and @xcite ) could systematically bias our results .",
    "for this reason , the distances and reddenings of @xcite appear a somewhat more objective set of values with which to investigate a relation between hb absolute magnitude and metallicity , in the sense that their isochrone fits , optimized for the cluster main sequences and lower rgb , give distances and reddenings perhaps more `` independently '' of the hb$ ] relation .",
    "we also caution that the interplay between hb morphology and other cluster parameters , including age , metallicity , light element abundances , and helium abundance , appears extremely complex and is under active investigation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the lower reddenings of @xcite are a likely contributor to the blueward offset of the @xcite relations in fig .",

    "in fact , if we simply apply a fixed color offset to the dsed and vr isochrones , they reproduce the observed cluster sequences down to the main sequence for metal - intermediate clusters , as shown in fig .",
    "[ isocomp_offset ] .    there",

    "[ offsetfig ] . in the case of the vr models ,",
    "the blueward shifts which we find necessary were also found at optical wavelengths by @xcite in the sense that their zahb fits yielded msto and rgb colors which were too red , but these shifts , which were all @xmath210.03 mag in @xmath70 , are too small alone to explain the present color discrepancies of @xmath41@xmath710.04 , which translates to @xmath41@xmath720.08 .",
    "an alternative explanation put forth by @xcite for the offset seen in optical colors is the downward revision of the ggc metallicity scale , although this would require a shift of @xmath6\\gtrsim$]0.3 dex based on the relations of fig .",
    "[ indicesfig ] .",
    "this is clearly unreasonable given the quality of the spectroscopic metallicities ( e.g.  fig .",
    "[ compmmo ] ) .",
    "the color offsets seen in the case of the dsed models are less drastic , and are confined to absolute values of @xmath45 which fall well within the margin allowed by photometric error and calibration uncertainties . while it may be unsurprising that the @xcite models require minimal color shifts since we adopted distances and reddenings based on the fits of these same models at optical wavelengths , our results serve as the first test of these models in the 2mass filter system over the range of ( age and metallicity ) parameter space occupied by ggcs .",
    "for both the dsed and vr models , the largest ( absolute ) offset is seen for ngc 5927 , the most metal - rich cluster in our sample . if we recalculate the offsets for this cluster assuming the value of @xmath6$]@xcite=-0.5 rather than @xmath6$]@xcite=-0.27 ( shown as squares in fig .",
    "[ isocomp_offset ] ) , the discrepancy between models and data is brought into the range occupied by the remainder of the ggcs , but it is not resolved . although our intention is not to sanction individual values for cluster parameters , such a downward revision of the ngc 5927 metallicity is suggested by the fits of figs .",

    "lastly , it is possible that the color offsets between models and data could be resolved by a shift in cluster distances .",

    "we have presented 2mass - calibrated @xmath75 cmds and fiducial sequences for 12 ggcs .",

    "the resulting relations have slopes in excellent agreement with previous studies , and show zero point differences which can be attributed to uncertainties in the distance and reddening of the target clusters .",
    "while we have chosen to use cluster distances and reddenings based on isochrone fits by @xcite to deep optical photometry , our relations are largely insensitive to current uncertainties in cluster distances , reddenings and metallicities for the more controversial cases",
    ". however , their precision as well as the size of the present sample could be improved by detailed spectroscopic abundances for a statistically representative quantity of cluster members , especially among the most metal - rich ggcs .",
    "a comparison of empirical fiducial sequences to five sets of evolutionary models reveals that dsed and vr models most successfully reproduce the observed morphology of the rgb , although a color offset is needed to reconcile models and data .",
    "although this offset is not formally significant compared to photometric errors as well as photometric calibration uncertainties ( at least in the case of the dsed models ) , a comparison between the results of @xcite and @xcite suggests that it is unlikely to be caused solely by uncertainties in cluster distance and reddening values .",
    "models also suggest that a modest ( @xmath41@xmath44=0.04 ) helium enhancement negligibly affects the rgb morphology , although @xmath2-enhancement plays a significant role , particularly on the upper rgb .",
    "this is in accord with our empirical relations , which generally give decreased rms residuals when fits are performed versus the global metallicity @xmath37 $ ] rather than @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "relations between cluster metallicity and the near - ir magnitudes of the rgb bump and the hb ( in the case of clusters with sufficiently red hbs ) are also insensitive to the choice of recent cluster distances , reddenings , metallicities and ages beyond current uncertainties .",
    "importantly , when using the lf peak to characterize the hb magnitude and its uncertainty , we find a non - negligible dependence between the near - ir hb magnitude and the cluster metallicity .",

    "the photometric catalogs and observed fiducial sequences presented here are being made publicly available , so that the our relations may be modified as the ggc distance and metallicity scales are improved .",
