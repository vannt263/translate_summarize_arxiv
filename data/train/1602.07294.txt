    "the study of diverse complex three - dimensional ( 3d ) modes , such as spinning solitons and vortex rings @xcite , knots @xcite , hopfions @xcite , and skyrmions @xcite is one of central topics in the classical field theory @xcite .",
    "in addition to the well - known applications of skyrmions to low - energy hadron physics @xcite , states approximated by the field - theory modes can be identified in ferromagnets and ferroelectrics @xcite , superconductors @xcite , and semiconductors @xcite .",
    "an exceptionally clean and well - controlled implementation of various modes predicted in the field theory is offered by atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . in particular ,",
    "the possibility of the creation of bec  skyrmions was predicted in a number of settings @xcite and realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "also predicted were settings appropriate for the creation of atomic knots @xcite and hopfions @xcite , and the experimental creation of monopoles was recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this topic is closely related to the general problem of the creation of 2d and 3d self - trapped modes in nonlinear media ( often considered as solitons ) , which also finds many physically relevant ramifications general - reviews , @xcite , especially in nonlinear optics and matter - wave dynamics in becs .",
    "in addition to the great significance to fundamental studies in these fields , 2d optical solitons may be used as bit carriers in all - optical data - processing schemes @xcite , and 3d matter - wave solitons are expected to provide a basis for precise interferometry @xcite .",
    "the objective of this work is to demonstrate that a 3d two - component system , which can be readily implemented in bec , makes it possible to create new nontrivial bound states and robust dynamical regimes , built of coaxial or mutually perpendicular dipole modes or vortices in the two components , that are of definite interest as field - theory modes , and , simultaneously , suggest novel possibilities for the experimental emulation of the field - theory settings in atomic bec .",
    "although the overall 3d nonlinear - field dynamics seems complex enough ( remaining regular , rather then getting chaotic ) , a remarkable fact is that it can be very accurately represented by a six - mode galerkin approximation ( ga ) , which , in turn , admits an essentially analytical investigation .",
    "this finding suggests that the projection onto an appropriately chosen ga may be useful in other nonlinear field - theory models too .",
    "getting back to the introduction into the general topic , it is relevant to mention that the creation of multidimensional solitons is often complicated by the fact that such states , usually supported by the cubic self - focusing nonlinearity , are subject to instability caused by the wave collapse ( critical and supercritical collapse in 2d and 3d , respectively ) collapse .",
    "multidimensional vortex solitons , alias vortex rings , in cubic media are vulnerable to a still stronger splitting instability induced by modulational perturbations in the azimuthal direction @xcite . these instabilities may be suppressed by means of periodic potentials ( lattices ) , as was predicted theoretically @xcite and demonstrated in the experiment @xcite ; very recently , it was also predicted that the spin - orbit coupling can stabilize 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite solitons in two - component systems .",
    "such physical media are modeled by the non - relativistic nonlinear schrdinger equation , alias gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite , for the corresponding photonic or atomic mean - field wave function @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are appropriately scaled spatial coordinates and time:@xmath6 in this equation , @xmath7 is the 3d laplacian , @xmath8 is the trapping potential , and @xmath9 or @xmath10 corresponds to the self - focusing or defocusing ( repulsive ) sign of the cubic interaction.in particular , in the case of axially symmetric potentials ( including spherically isotropic ones ) , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the set of cylindrical coordinates , eq .",

    "@xcite : a _ spatially inhomogeneous _ repulsive cubic nonlinearity , whose local strength in the space of dimension @xmath18 grows from the center to periphery faster than @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the radial coordinate ) , supports extremely robust and diverse families of solitons , multipoles , fundamental and composite solitary vortices , and hopfions for @xmath21 further .",
    "this type of the nonlinearity modulation belongs to the general class of the nonlinear pseudopotentials , which can be induced by various techniques in optics for @xmath22 , and in bec for @xmath23 too @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", it was demonstrated in detail theoretically that the usual 2d and 3d settings , which combine spatially uniform cubic self - repulsion and an isotropic harmonic - oscillator ( ho ) trapping potential , readily give rise to various bound states , including trapped vortices vortices as well as vortex clusters and dipoles @xcite .",
    "the formation of vortices in optics and bec  was reported in many experimental works @xcite , see also review @xcite .",
    "the stability of the vortices in these settings is essentially secured by the fact that the repulsive nonlinearity does not give rise to modulational instability .",
    "multi - component becs with repulsive self- and cross - interactions ( usually , they are realized as mixtures of different hyperfine atomic states of the same species ) may also give rise to stable vortices @xcite and , furthermore , to the above - mentioned matter - wave skyrmions bec - skyrmions , skyrmion - exper and monopoles @xcite .",
    "further , the studies of two - component systems suggest that two identical 3d  gpes coupled by the repulsive interaction , each with an isotropic ho trapping potential , may be used as a simple model for the analysis of nontrivial dynamical regimes , such as interaction of non - coaxial ( or , more specifically , mutually perpendicular ) trapped vortices or dipoles initially created in the two wave fields .",
    "this possibility was recently proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite were stable vortices having orthogonal vortex lines and trapped in a ho trap were found .",
    "if initially the modes deviate from the stationary state , the nonlinear repulsive interactions lead to smooth dynamics representing torque - free precession with nutations .",
    "the model was studied under the condition that the inter - species repulsion was weaker than the self - repulsion in each component . in this case",
    ", it was concluded that the system is robust with respect to variation of parameters .    in the present work",
    "we address a system of two gpes which is dominated by intra - species repulsion , while the intra - species self - interactions may be neglected .",
    "we predict experimentally observable stationary and dynamical modes by means of systematic simulations and , in parallel , making use of the above - mentioned six - mode ga .",
    "the approach developed here is similar to its well - known applications of the ga in hydrodynamics @xcite , projecting the coupled gpes for two mean - field wave functions onto the truncated dynamical system .",
    "the six - mode truncation approximates each wave function by a combination of three _",
    "p_-wave eigenfunctions of the 3d ho , with orbital quantum number @xmath1 and magnetic quantum numbers @xmath24 , assuming that the axes which define the two triplets of the eigenfunctions are _ mutually perpendicular_. the accuracy provided by the ga turns out to be surprisingly high , provided that the nonlinear interaction is not too strong ( at certain threshold of nonlinear interaction strength a deviation from the ga is observed due to generation of components with @xmath25 ) .",
    "in particular , fixed points ( fps ) of the ga provide for a very good approximation for quasi - stationary states of the coupled gpe system .",
    "taking sets of non - coaxial dipoles or vortices in the two wave fields as initial states , their nonlinear interaction leads , in the framework of the gpes and ga alike , to remarkably robust dynamical regimes , which are characterized by a periodic exchange of the angular momentum between the two field components and a periodic switch of their structure , with the dipoles transforming into vortices and vice versa .",

  "abstract_text": [
    "<S> the dynamics of a pair of harmonic oscillators ( hos ) represented by three - dimensional fields coupled by a repulsive cubic nonlinearity is investigated through direct simulations of the respective field equations , and with the help of the finite - mode galerkin approximation ( ga ) , which represents the two interacting fields by a superposition of @xmath0 ho _ p_-wave eigenfunctions with orbital and magnetic quantum numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the system can be implemented in binary bose - einstein condensates , demonstrating a potential of the atomic condensates for emulating various complex modes predicted by classical field theories , first , the ga very accurately predicts a _ broadly degenerate _ set of the system s ground states in the _ p_-wave manifold , in the form of complexes built of a dipole coaxial with another dipole or vortex , as well as complexes built of mutually orthogonal dipoles . </S>",
    "<S> next , pairs of non - coaxial vortices and/or dipoles , including pairs of mutually perpendicular vortices , develop remarkably stable dynamical regimes , which feature periodic exchange of the angular momentum and periodic switching between dipoles and vortices . </S>",
    "<S> for a moderately strong nonlinearity , simulations of the coupled field equations agree very well with results produced by the ga , demonstrating that the dynamics is accurately spanned by the set of six modes limited to @xmath1 . </S>"
