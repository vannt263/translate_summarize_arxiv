    "here , we show that there is another way to have a formal version of yablo s paradox ( different from the formalized version discussed above ) , and that is in linear temporal logic .",
    "the ( propositional ) linear temporal logic ( ltl ) is a logical formalism that can refer to time ; in ltl one can encode formulae about the future , e.g. , a condition will eventually be true , a condition will be true until another fact becomes true , etc .",
    "ltl was first proposed for the formal verification of computer programs in 1977 by amir pnueli @xcite . for a modern introduction to ltl and its syntax and semantics see e.g. @xcite .",
    "two modality operators in ltl that we will use are the `` next '' modality denoted by @xmath23 and the `` always '' modality denoted as @xmath24 .",
    "we assume the reader is familiar with the general framework of ltl , but for the sake of accessibility , we list the main notations , definitions and theorems which will be referred to later on .",
    "for details we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 be a set of _ propositional constants_. the alphabet of a basic language @xmath26 ( also shortly : @xmath27 ) of propositional linear temporal logic ltl is given by    all propositional constants of @xmath25 and the symbols @xmath28 .",
    "the inductive definition of formulas ( of @xmath26 ) is as follows :    1every propositional constant of @xmath25 and also the constant symbol @xmath29 is a formula .",
    "2if @xmath30 and @xmath31 are formulas then @xmath32 is a formula .",
    "3if @xmath30 is a formula then @xmath33 and @xmath34 are formulas .",
    "further operators can be introduced as abbreviations :    @xmath35 as in classical logic , and @xmath36 .    the temporal operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 are called _ next time _ , _ always ( or henceforth ) _ , and _ sometime ( or eventuality ) _ operators , respectively .",
    "formulas @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath39 are typically read `` next @xmath30 '' , `` always @xmath30 '' , and `` sometime @xmath30 '' .",
    "semantical interpretations in classical propositional logic are given by boolean valuations .",
    "for ltl we have to extend this concept according to our informal idea that formulas are evaluated over sequences of states ( time scales ) .",
    "let @xmath25 be a set of propositional constants .",
    "temporal ( or kripke ) structure _ for @xmath25 is an infinite sequence @xmath40 of mappings @xmath41 called _ states _ , and @xmath42 is called the _ initial state _ of @xmath43 .",
    "observe that states are just valuations in the classical logic sense .",
    "for @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we define @xmath45 ( informally meaning the `` truth value of @xmath46 in the @xmath47 state of @xmath43 '' ) for every formula @xmath46",
    "inductively as follows :    01 .",
    "@xmath48  for @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51  or   @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath53 .",
    "@xmath54  for every @xmath55 .",
    "obviously , the formula @xmath29 and the operator @xmath56 behave classically in each state .",
    "the definitions for @xmath23 and @xmath24 make these operators formalize the phrases _ in the next state _ and _ from this step onward_. more precisely , the formula @xmath34 informally means `` @xmath30 holds in all forthcoming states including the present one '' .",
    "the definitions induce the following truth values for the formula abbreviations :    06 .",
    "@xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58  or   @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath59  and   @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath60 .    10 .",
    "@xmath61 .    11 .",
    "@xmath62  for some @xmath55 .",
    "a formula @xmath30 of @xmath63 is called _ valid _ in the temporal structure @xmath43 for @xmath25 ( or @xmath43 satisfies @xmath30 ) , denoted by @xmath64 , if @xmath65 for every @xmath66 .",
    "the formula @xmath30 is called a consequence of a set @xmath67 of formulas @xmath68 if @xmath64 holds for every @xmath43 such that @xmath69 for all @xmath70 . the formula @xmath30 is called _ ( universally ) valid _ ( @xmath71 ) if @xmath72 . a formula",
    "@xmath30 is called ( locally ) satisfiable if there is a temporal structure @xmath43 and @xmath66 such that @xmath73 . @xmath74    the formula @xmath75 holds ( in the current moment ) when @xmath30 is true in the `` next step '' , and the formula @xmath76 is true ( in the current moment ) when @xmath30 is true `` now and forever '' ( `` always in the future '' ) . in the other words , @xmath24 is the reflexive and transitive closure of @xmath23 .",
    "so the formula @xmath77 is true when @xmath31 is true from the next step onward , that is @xmath31 holds in the next step , and the step after that , and the step after that , etc .",
    "the same holds for @xmath78 ; indeed the formula @xmath79 is a law of @xmath80 ( t12 on page 28 of @xcite ) .",
    "it can also be seen that the formula @xmath81 is always true ( is a law of ltl , see t1 on page 27 of @xcite ) , since @xmath30 is untrue in the next step if and only if it is not the case that `` @xmath30 is true in the next step '' .",
    "whence , we have the equivalences @xmath82 in ltl .",
    "the following theorem will be used in our arguments .",
    "[ th2.1.9tempo ] ltl @xmath71 if and only if @xmath83 is not satisfiable .",
    "a version of yablo s paradox is a sentence @xmath84 that satisfies the followng equivalences    @xmath85    in the other words @xmath84 is a fixed ",
    "point of the operator @xmath86 .",
    "yablo s argument in his paradox amounts to showing that this operator does not have any fixed ",
    "point in ltl .",
    "the semantic proof ( i.e. non  existence of any such fixed  point in any kripke model of ltl ) is exactly the same as yablo s argument . now , yablo s paradox becomes the following theorem .",
    "[ thm - yab1 ] ltl @xmath87 .    to show this formula is valid",
    "will exactly follow the line of yablo s reasoning to obtain his paradox , this time in ltl . by theorem  [ th2.1.9tempo ] , to prove the formula @xmath88 is valid in ltl , we need to show the formula @xmath89 is not satisfiable . for a moment",
    "assume that there is a kripke structure @xmath43 and @xmath90 for which @xmath91 .",
    "then @xmath92 which implies that @xmath93 .",
    "we distinguish two cases :    \\(1 ) for some @xmath94 we have @xmath95 .",
    "then @xmath96 so @xmath97 for all @xmath98 . in particular",
    "@xmath99 whence @xmath100 which is in contradiction with @xmath96 .",
    "\\(2 ) for all @xmath94 we have @xmath101 .",
    "so @xmath102 hence there must exist some @xmath103 with @xmath104 which contradicts ( 1 ) above .",
    "thus , the formula @xmath89 can not be satisfiable in ltl .    also , a gdel  like argument can show that the operators @xmath105 and @xmath106 can not have any fixed ",
    "points in ltl as well .",
    "the operators @xmath107 and @xmath106 do not have any fixed ",
    "points in ltl ; i.e. for any formula @xmath30 we have @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "we show that satisfiability of @xmath110 in ltl leads to a contradiction . for a moment",
    "let there exist some kripke structure @xmath43 and @xmath90 for which @xmath111 .",
    "then for any @xmath112 we have @xmath113 whence @xmath114 .",
    "this already implies that @xmath115 ( since @xmath116 ) .",
    "then , in particular , @xmath117 and so there must exist some @xmath118 such that @xmath119 contradiction !    some other operators like @xmath120 or @xmath121 do have fixed ",
    "points ; @xmath122 or @xmath29 for the former and the sequences @xmath123 or @xmath124 for the latter ( see @xcite ) .",
    "yablo s paradox comes in several varieties @xcite ; here we show that other versions of yablo s paradox become interesting theorems in ltl as well .",
    "let us focus now on the `` '' version of yablo s paradox .",
    "let @xmath139 be a sequence of sentences that each sentence , roughly speaking , says `` all sentences , except finitely many , after this sentence are false '' .",
    "mathematically , this sequence is as below :      the paradox arises when we try to assign truth values in a consistent way to all @xmath141 s .",
    "assume for a moment that there is a sentence ( say ) @xmath142 which is true ; so there exists @xmath103 for which all @xmath143 with @xmath55 are untrue .",
    "in particular , @xmath144 is untrue .",
    "since all the sentences @xmath145 are untrue , so @xmath141 has to be true .",
    "therefore , @xmath141 is true and false the same time , which is a contradiction .",
    "whence , all @xmath142 s are untrue , so @xmath146 is true , a contradiction again .",
    "now we turn this version of yablo s paradox to a theorem in ltl .",
    "we show that the formula @xmath148 is not satisfiable in ltl . for a moment , assume that there is a kripke structure @xmath43 and a state @xmath90 for which @xmath149 .",
    "so , we have @xmath150 which implies @xmath151 which is equivalent to @xmath152 .",
    "\\(1 ) if there is some @xmath153 such that @xmath154 , then @xmath155 for some @xmath156 ; so @xmath157 and also @xmath158 for all @xmath159 . on the other hand there must exist some @xmath160 such that @xmath161 which implies that @xmath162 for some @xmath163 .",
