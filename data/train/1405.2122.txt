    "after a change of coordinates , assume that @xmath6 .    a _ logarithmic derivation _ ( or _ logarithmic vector field _ ) of @xmath0 is an element @xmath7 , such that @xmath8 , for all @xmath9 . picking the standard basis for @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 , if @xmath12 is written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 are homogeneous polynomials of the same degree , then @xmath15 .",
    "the set of logarithmic derivations forms an @xmath16module , and whenever this module is free one says that the hyperplane arrangement is _",
    "free_.    in general , every central hyperplane arrangement has _ the euler derivation _ : @xmath17 there exists a one - to - one correspondence between logarithmic derivations not multiples of @xmath18 and the first syzygies on the _ jacobian ideal of @xmath0 _ , which is the ideal of @xmath19 generated by the ( first order ) partial derivatives of the defining polynomial of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we are interested in hyperplane arrangements that have a minimal quadratic syzygy , on its jacobian ideal . throughout the notes we are going to use both terminologies : `` non - trivial logarithmic derivation '' or `` minimal quadratic syzygy '' .",
    "@xcite presents interesting constructions of hyperplane arrangements with linear or quadratic syzygies .",
    "these are summed up in proposition 8.5 : if @xmath0 is an essential arrangement with @xmath20 , for all subarrangements @xmath21 , then the jacobian ideal of @xmath0 has only linear or quadratic syzygies , which are combinatorially constructed . here",
    "@xmath22 is the _ excess _ of @xmath23 .",
    "a question comes up immediately : is it true that a free hyperplane arrangement with exponents @xmath24 s and @xmath25 s is supersolvable ?",
    "the answer would be yes , if one shows that a free arrangement with exponents @xmath24 s and @xmath25 s has quadratic orlik - terao algebra .",
    "then , by using ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorems 5.1 and 5.11 ) , one obtains supersolvability .    in these notes we do not discuss the freeness of the hyperplane arrangements we study .",
    "we are more interested in the geometry of the configuration of points that are dual to the hyperplanes of an arrangement that has a quadratic syzygy on its jacobian ideal .    at the beginning of the next section",
    "we briefly review ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 4.29(3 ) ) that characterizes hyperplane arrangements with a linear syzygy , and we look at this result from the projective duality view mentioned already .",
    "next we study hyperplane arrangements with a quadratic minimal syzygy .",
    "we also obtain that the dual points lie on an interesting variety , though its description is not even close to the nice combinatorial case of the linear syzygy",
    ". nevertheless , using this description we are able to classify up to a change of coordinates all rank 3 hyperplane arrangements having a quadratic minimal syzygy on their jacobian ideal ( theorem [ main2 ] ) .",
    "we end with two questions , one addressing a simpler and shorter proof of theorem [ main2 ] , and the other asking if it is possible to obtain a similar classification but for higher rank arrangements with a quadratic minimal logarithmic vector field .",
    "dropping the freeness condition which is not necessary in our study , ( * ? ? ? * proposition 4.29(3 ) ) shows the following : if @xmath0 is an arrangement with @xmath26 linearly independent degree 1 logarithmic derivations ( including @xmath18 ) , then @xmath0 is a direct product of @xmath26 irreducible arrangements .",
    "one can obtain the same result , with a different interpretation of @xmath26 , by studying the points dual to the hyperplanes of @xmath0 in the following manner . keeping the notations from the beginning of introduction ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath0 has a linear logarithmic derivation , not a constant multiple of @xmath18 : @xmath27 where @xmath28 are some linear forms in @xmath19 . because @xmath29 for some constants @xmath30 , then @xmath31 and not all @xmath32 s are equal to each - other ( otherwise we would get a constant multiple of @xmath18 ) .",
    "for @xmath33 , suppose @xmath34 .",
    "the logarithmic condition @xmath35 translates into @xmath36\\cdot \\left[\\begin{array}{c }   p_{1,i}\\\\   \\vdots\\\\   p_{k , i }   \\end{array}\\right]=\\lambda_i\\left[\\begin{array}{c }   p_{1,i}\\\\   \\vdots\\\\   p_{k , i }   \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] therefore the points in @xmath37 dual to the hyperplanes @xmath38 sit on the scheme with defining ideal @xmath39 generated by the @xmath40 minors of the matrix @xmath41.\\ ] ]      for a simple graph @xmath47 , a minimal vertex cover is a subset of vertices of @xmath47 , minimal under inclusion , such that every edge of @xmath47 has at least one vertex in this subset . by @xcite , since @xmath39 is the edge ideal of a simple graph @xmath47 ( complete multipartite ) , all the minimal primes of @xmath39 are generated by subsets of variables corresponding to the minimal vertex covers of @xmath47 .",
    "also , since @xmath39 is generated by square - free monomials , it must be a radical ideal , hence it is equal to the intersection of its minimal primes .",
    "it is not difficult to show that if @xmath47 is a complete multipartite graph with partition @xmath48 , then the minimal vertex covers of @xmath47 are @xmath49 .",
    "so @xmath50 the points dual to the hyperplanes of @xmath0 are in the zero set ( the variety ) of @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath51\\in v(i)$ ] , then there is @xmath52 with @xmath53 , for all @xmath54 .",
    "then the linear form dual to this point belongs to @xmath55 $ ] , so it defines a hyperplane in @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath0 has full rank , each component must contain at least one of these points , and therefore we can group the linear forms accordingly to the components their dual points belong to .",
    "so @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath48 is the partition of the complete multipartite graph we have seen above .",
    "in this subsection we consider hyperplane arrangements with quadratic logarithmic derivations , not a linear combination of linear logarithmic derivations .",
    "in other words , the jacobian ideal has a minimal quadratic syzygy .",
    "similarly to the linear syzygy case , we will analyse the dual points to each hyperplane in @xmath0 , and in fact the configuration of these points if @xmath0 has a quadratic logarithmic derivation .",
    "the next result gives the first insights into this regard .",
    "[ lemma_quadratic ] let @xmath0 be a hyperplane arrangement with a quadratic logarithmic derivation .",
    "if @xmath67 , where @xmath68 with @xmath69 , then @xmath70\\in v(i_{u , v}),\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the ideal of @xmath19 generated by the following @xmath72 elements : @xmath73 and @xmath74                        [ char ] if a hyperplane arrangement @xmath0 has a quadratic logarithmic derivation then the points dual to the hyperplanes of @xmath0 lie on the variety @xmath96 , where each ideal @xmath71 is defined as in lemma [ lemma_quadratic ] .      in this subsection",
    "we classify the line arrangements in @xmath97 having a minimal quadratic syzygy on its jacobian ideal . to differentiate from the previous subsection 2.1 ,",
    "we assume further that this jacobian ideal does not have a linear syzygy .                  if one of these ideals is the zero ideal , say @xmath108 , then @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this leads to @xmath111 with @xmath112 ( otherwise obtaining a linear syzygy on the jacobian ideal ) .",
    "then the quadratic logarithmic derivation becomes @xmath113            if @xmath129 , then @xmath130 , giving @xmath131 . _ a priori _ this could happen only if the defining polynomial of @xmath0 is @xmath132 .",
    "but this is a contradiction with the setup of this subsection : our arrangements do not have a linear syzygy .    [ main2 ]",
    "let @xmath0 be a line arrangement in @xmath97 , having a minimal quadratic syzygy on its jacobian ideal , but not a linear syzygy .",
    "then , up to a change of coordinates , @xmath0 is one of the following three types of arrangements with defining polynomials ( see also their affine pictures below ) :          @xmath136 if the zero locus of any of the three ideals contains 3 or more points , then the corresponding ideal will have codimension 1 , and hence will be generated by the linear generator ( if the coefficients of this are not zero ) .",
    "this comes from the fact that if the codimension of such an ideal is 2 , then the zero locus will be a finite set of points , and since the ideal is generated by a linear form and a quadric , by bzout s theorem we can have at most 2 points in this zero locus ( exactly 2 if the line and the conic intersect transversally ) .",
    "lemma [ special_case ] assures that this codimension is @xmath144 .            if @xmath148 then these @xmath149 points will be on @xmath150 , hence their first coordinate will be zero .",
    "so @xmath151 , and these @xmath149 points have homogeneous coordinates @xmath152 $ ] , for some @xmath153 .      we can have @xmath158 , leading to the point @xmath159 $ ] , and the corresponding dual linear form @xmath160 ; or @xmath161 and in this last situation @xmath152\\in v(i_{xz})\\cap v(i_{yz})$ ] ( as all the coordinates of this point are different than zero , and from lemma [ lemma_quadratic ] ) .",
    "so @xmath162 , leading to @xmath163 .",
    "note that also @xmath164 , but by using @xmath165 and @xmath166 , after simplifying by @xmath147 one obtains the same @xmath163 .",
    "looking at @xmath99 , if @xmath171 , for some @xmath44 , then none of the corresponding @xmath172 or @xmath173 can be zero , as we would obtain @xmath142 or @xmath126 .",
    "so the dual point @xmath174 $ ] has the first two coordinates @xmath175 , the setup of case 1 .",
    "hence @xmath176 , equivalently obtaining the linear form @xmath160 ; same situation when @xmath158 .            _",
    "first possibility .",
    "_ suppose there exists another ( dual ) point , different than @xmath139 $ ] and @xmath186 $ ] , and with the first and last coordinate different than zero .",
    "then , by lemma [ lemma_quadratic ] this point belongs to @xmath140 , and hence it has homogeneous coordinates",
    "@xmath187=[b_1,t'/w ,- a_2/w]$ ] , for some @xmath188 .",
    "if @xmath189 , then this extra point is in @xmath138 as well ( by lemma [ lemma_quadratic ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath190 .",
    "so our extra point is not different than @xmath186 $ ] , though we assumed that it is .",
    "this leads to the only possible for this extra dual point to be @xmath191 $ ] .        _",
    "second possibility .",
    "_ suppose in addition to the _ first possibility _ above , there is an extra dual point with the last two coordinates different than zero , and different than @xmath186 $ ] .",
    "this extra point must have coordinates @xmath200=[t''/w ,- a_1,-a_2/w]$ ] ( from the conditions expressed above ) .",
    "similarly as before , one must have @xmath201 , and therefore this extra point is @xmath202 $ ] .    1 .",
    "if _ first and second possibilities _ occur , then the defining polynomial of @xmath0 is of the form @xmath203 . after an appropriate change of coordinates one",
    "gets @xmath204 which is the braid arrangement @xmath205 , or type ( 3 ) in our statement .",
    "if just the _ first possibility _ occurs , then the defining polynomial of @xmath0 is @xmath206 an arrangement of type ( 1 ) of 5 lines . 3 .",
    "if none of the _ possibilities _ occur , then one obtains the defining polynomial of @xmath0 is @xmath207 an arrangement of type ( 2 ) of 4 lines .",
    "case 1.2.1 : suppose one of the @xmath149 points also has the third coordinate different than zero .",
    "so this point is of the form @xmath210 $ ] , with @xmath120 .",
    "lemma_quadratic ] implies that these coordinates must satisfy also the equations @xmath211      if there is another dual point with the first and last coordinate not equal to zero , and different than this point , then , from the two bullets at the beginning of the proof , @xmath192 leading to @xmath193 dividing @xmath215 .",
    "but under the conditions @xmath216 , this is impossible .",
    "looking at @xmath99 , if @xmath221 , for some @xmath44 , then the corresponding @xmath222 , as we would obtain @xmath142 or @xmath116 .",
    "so this point is of the form @xmath223\\in v(i_{xz})$ ] ; therefore @xmath224 , and therefore obtaining @xmath225 .",
    "also , if the linear forms different than these @xmath149 are @xmath235 and @xmath236 , then @xmath0 is a pencil of lines and a line at infinity , which is the case of section 2 about arrangements with linear syzygies .",
    "since we exclude this particular case , we can assume that there must exist a point with the first and last coordinate not zero .",
    "this extra point is in @xmath140 , so it must satisfy the equations @xmath237 so there can exist only one such extra point : @xmath238 $ ] . in this case , the defining polynomial looks like : @xmath239 which after a change of coordinates is of type ( 1 ) if @xmath219 , and it is of type ( 2 ) if @xmath230 .",
    "* case 2 : * suppose that we have exactly one dual point with the first two coordinates nonzero , exactly one point with the first and last coordinates nonzero , and exactly one point with the last two coordinates nonzero .",
    "then it is not difficult to see that we obtain a type ( 3 ) arrangement .",
    "[ remark1 ] in the setup of theorem [ main2 ] , using ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.6 ) one obtains that the singular locus of @xmath0 lies on a cubic curve .",
    "first observe that in all the three types presented this is indeed the case , the cubic being a union of three lines .",
    "second , let us consider an arrangement of 5 generic lines .",
    "the singular locus consists of 10 points which are in sufficiently general position such that there is no cubic passing through all of them ; every time one requires for a cubic to pass to such a point the dimension of the space of cubics drops by one , starting with the dimension of plane cubics being equal to 10 .",
    "so @xmath0 can not have as a subarrangement an arrangement of 5 generic lines .",
    "we end with a remark regarding a possible generalization of theorem [ main2 ] to hyperplane arrangements in arbitrary number of variables and having a quadratic minimal syzygy ( i.e. , quadratic minimal logarithmic derivation ) .",
    "[ remark2 ] the argumentation presented in subsection 2.1 is based on the primary decomposition of a certain edge ideal .",
    "the similar ideal of interest in the case of quadratic logarithmic derivation is @xmath240 , where each ideal @xmath71 is defined as in lemma [ lemma_quadratic ]",
    ". it would be really interesting to be able to follow the same approach and use the primary decomposition of @xmath241 in order to prove theorem [ main2 ] .        * acknowledgement * we are grateful to torsten hoge for pointing out to us the result from @xcite concerning arrangements with linear syzygies , and for additional discussions and corrections .",
    "we are also thankful to the two anonymous referees for corrections and suggestions ."
