    "multilevel atoms , under the action of multiple fields , display a variety of phenomena brought about by the ac stark splitting of electronic levels and by interference due to induced coherences .",
    "these manifest themselves as splitting of peaks , inhibition of absorption or emission , narrow windows of transparency , etc . theoretical work on this front have considered @xmath1 , v and ladder type of three level systems @xcite .",
    "the presence of additional levels increases multifold the possibilities of interference phenomena that exist .",
    "the nested @xmath1 and the n systems have been examined to some extent @xcite . in this paper",
    "we examine an `` inverted n '' system using the density matrix formalism .",
    "recent experimental observations in @xmath0 @xcite have prompted the study of this four - level system under the action of two fields .",
    "the experiment in @xcite consisted of driving a collection of @xmath0 atoms with two fields- a strong `` cooling '' field and a weak `` repumper '' field .",
    "one of the lasers , the cooling ( pump ) laser was held at a fixed detuning @xmath2 from the conventional cooling transition ( @xmath3 ) and the repumper ( probe ) laser was scanned with its detuning ( @xmath4 ) from @xmath5 level varying over the entire manifold , f=2 @xmath6 f=1,2,3 ( see fig .",

    "narrow fluorescence peaks were observed at definite @xmath4 for a given @xmath2 . while one would expect a broad fluorescence , with the width indicative of the temperature of the gas , the experiment showed fluorescence peaks just 30mhz in width , much smaller than their doppler width of 500mhz .",
    "this was explained on the basis of a double resonance model which maximised fluorescence whenever the atom found both the cooling and repumping lasers on resonance with their respective transitions .",
    "a simple analytical treatment based on the above model showed that atom transfer efficiency by the repumper laser to the levels connected by the cooling laser was maximised under the double resonance condition and gave rise to narrow fluorescence peaks .",
    "+ in this paper , we present a rigorous treatment of the same problem using a four level density matrix formalism .",
    "our treatment differs from the earlier studies of four - level density matrix @xcite in that ( a ) it considers an inverted n system and ( b ) it takes into account the motion of the atoms in co- and counter - propagating geometries with respect to the cooling and repumper beams .",
    "the four levels under consideration are : the two ground hyperfine levels f=2,3 and the two excited levels f=3,4. for simplicity , we have considered an one dimensional situation where the two driving fields are in the @xmath8 direction and the atom is moving along the z direction with a velocity @xmath9 .",
    "the detuning of the cooling laser taking the doppler effect into account is @xmath10 = @xmath11 and the repumper laser s detuning is @xmath12 = @xmath13 where , @xmath2 and @xmath4 are the detunings of the laser in the laboratory frame .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the system consisting of the atom and the light fields is written in the interaction picture as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the hamiltonian for the bare atom and @xmath16 is the atom - light interaction hamiltonian .",

    "the total hamiltonian can be written in matrix form as follows @xmath26 where the rows and columns correspond to levels @xmath27 , 4 in sequence .",
    "the dynamics of the system described by this hamiltonian can be studied using the density matrix @xmath28 .",
    "the time evolution of the density matrix @xmath29 is given by the liouville equation @xmath30 -\\frac{1}{2 } \\{\\gamma , \\rho \\ }   \\label{lio}\\ ] ] with @xmath31 where @xmath32 being the spontaneous decay rate from the @xmath33 level to the @xmath34 level . is the decay rate of the level j to the level i. this is however a diagonal matrix ] the rate equations of the four levels for an atom moving with a velocity @xmath35 are derived under the rotating wave approximation .",

    "1b , when the cooling and repumping beams are both along @xmath8 directions .",
    "initially let us consider the atoms to be at rest .",
    "for a given detuning @xmath2 of the cooling ( pump ) laser , we should get fluorescence peaks corresponding to the autler - townes ( at ) dressed states of @xmath42 at the probe ( repumper ) detunings @xcite @xmath43 here @xmath44 = @xmath45mhz + @xmath2 denotes the detuning of the cooling laser from @xmath46 transition , @xmath47 mhz being the level spacing between @xmath42 and @xmath48 levels and @xmath49 its rabi frequency .",
    "for the specific case shown in figure 2 , for a cooling laser detuning @xmath50 and for small @xmath49 , the autler - townes peak positions for these zero velocity atoms are @xmath51 mhz .",
    "this is confirmed from our density matrix calculations . at these detunings of the probe",
    "its absorption is maximised and repumping most efficient as seen from figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) which give @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 as functions of @xmath4 .",
    "+ consider now an atom in motion with a velocity @xmath55 , along the @xmath56 direction .",
    "if @xmath57 this atom predominantly absorbs from the cooling beam coming towards it ( c ) .",
    "since the repumper laser is scanned , depending on the sign of @xmath4 the atom absorbs either from b or from d. so for a given @xmath2 , altogether we get four peaks , a autler - townes pair each shifted due to the doppler effect , depending upon whether absorption takes place from the repumper beam b or from repumper beam d. the same holds for @xmath58 for atoms with velocity @xmath59 . +",
    "the at doublet positions as given in equation ( 21 ) when applied to atoms in motion and , for small @xmath49 and @xmath57 are @xmath60 as the repumper is scanned , maximum transfer of population from f = 2 to f= 3 will occur when these conditions are satisfied . now , as mentioned in @xcite and as will be shown shortly , the fluorescence is predominantly from @xmath61 .",
    "however , not all atoms in f =3 will be in resonance with the cooling laser ; only a small velocity class around @xmath62 will give rise to fluorescence .",
    "this is the mechanism that gives rise to narrow velocity selection from a hot gas .",
    "this velocity selection effect is confirmed by our calculations and is shown in fig . 4 which gives @xmath63 and @xmath64 as functions of the velocity of the atom for @xmath65= -162 mhz .",
    "we see that the population in f=4 ( @xmath63 ) is two orders more than that in f=3 ( @xmath64 ) and it peaks at the critical velocity @xmath66 .",
    "therefore only for velocities around @xmath67 will the fluorescence from @xmath68 be maximised , showing that indeed the double resonance condition selects a narrow velocity class for fluorescence .",
    "+ the autler - townes peak positions , as given by equations ( @xmath69 ) , with the constraint that double resonance should also be satisfied for maximum fluorescence , require that @xmath70 when repumper absorption takes place from d and @xmath71 when repumper absorption takes place from b. + the same conditions result for atoms with a velocity @xmath59 , for @xmath72 .",
    "it has been estimated in @xcite that the peak at @xmath73 is broad and the one at @xmath74 is narrow .",
    "the width of the at peaks decide the prominence of a fluorescence peak as it decides the number of atoms participating in the fluorescence .",
    "thus for peak positions @xmath73 = @xmath2 & @xmath75 we expect a large fluorescence whereas for the peak at @xmath76 we expect a much smaller fluorescence as is indeed seen from experiment and from our calculations ( fig .",
    "2 ) . as mentioned in @xcite this peak is well resolved only at large detunings .",
    "+ the peak around @xmath74 = @xmath47 mhz + @xmath77 is absent both in experiment and in our density matrix calculation .",
    "for this case , the repumper absorption takes place from b whereas the cooling is absorbed from c. when the absorption takes place from counter - propagating cooling and repumper beams the velocity class satisfying the double resonance is severely restricted .",
    "in fact only for @xmath78 will the double resonance condition be satisfied .",
    "atoms with @xmath79 will see the cooling and repumper to be shifted by different detunings and hence will not contribute to the fluorescence .",
    "thus the peaks resulting from this configuration will not be resolvable as only a very small number of atoms contribute to it . the severely restricted velocity range at resonance resulting in the absence of the peak at @xmath80 is illustrated in fig .",
    "5b which is obtained from the density matrix calculation .",
    "as we see here , only a small number in a very narrow velocity range contribute to population in f=4 in contrast to the case @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "+    the peaks marked ( a ) and ( b ) in figure 2 are the peaks corresponding to the at levels of @xmath82 at @xmath83 & @xmath75 corresponding to absorption from counter and co - propagating repumper beams . our calculation has not reproduced this peak , as the level f=2 was not included in the density matrix .",
    "nevertheless the peak positions can be simply calculated from the corresponding peaks for f=3 by shifting them by @xmath84 .",
    "the peak at @xmath85 falls at the same @xmath74 for both @xmath86 and @xmath42 .",
    "+ the theoretically calculated widths of the fluorescence peaks match the experimentally observed narrow width of about @xmath87 .",
    "it should be emphasised that this does not arise due to the cooling of atoms in the optical molasses like configuration but due to the velocity selection as discussed above .",
    "these fluorescence peaks are experimentally seen to be narrow even for blue detunings of the cooling beam where no cooling occurs and the atoms are at _ room temperature_. the corresponding doppler width is several hundred mhz at this temperature .",
    "the additonal effects of cooling on these fluorescent peaks in a doppler free beam geometry will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "the experimental observations of @xcite has been explained using a four - level density matrix formalism .",
    "the theory finds that the fluorescence peaks are given rise by the autler - townes ( at ) doublets of @xmath42 and @xmath82 for atoms around a particular velocity class .",
    "the theory gives the three at peaks of @xmath42 at positions borne out by the experiment .",
    "the theory also explains the absence of the fourth peak .",
    "the widths and heights of the peaks agree quite well with the experimentally obtained widths and heights .",
