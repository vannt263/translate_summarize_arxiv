    "<S> scaling transistors dimensions has been the thrust for the semiconductor industry in the last 4 decades . however , scaling channel lengths beyond 10 nm has become exceptionally challenging due to the direct tunneling between source and drain which degrades gate control , switching functionality , and worsens power dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , the emergence of novel classes of materials with exotic properties in recent times has opened up new avenues in device design . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that by using channel materials with an anisotropic effective mass , the channel can be scaled down to 1 nm and still provide an excellent switching performance in both mosfets and tfets . in the case of tfets , </S>",
    "<S> a novel design has been proposed to take advantage of anisotropic mass in both on- and off - state of the tfets . </S>",
    "<S> full - band atomistic quantum transport simulations of phosphorene nanoribbon mosfets and tfets based on the new design have been performed as a proof .    </S>",
    "<S> [ 1]*_keywords _ * # 1    shrinking the size of metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors ( mosfets ) has improved the functionality , speed , and cost of microprocessors over the last four decades . however , the advantages of scaling are quickly fading away @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the operational frequency of cpus has stopped improving since 2003 due to power consumption of cpus reaching their cooling limit ( @xmath0100w/@xmath1 ) @xcite . moreover , scaling down @xmath2 towards the few nanometer regime is becoming more challenging due to source - to - drain ( sd ) leakage current @xcite ; the gate controlled potential barrier becomes more transparent as channel becomes shorter and direct sd tunneling increases . </S>",
    "<S> another challenge in miniaturizing mosfets is scaling down the supply voltage @xmath3 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a smaller @xmath3 can be achieved in a switch with sharper on to off transition . </S>",
    "<S> however , the steepness of conventional mosfets have a fundamental limit due to thermionic injection of carriers over the channel barrier ( 60 @xmath4 at room temperature ) . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , @xmath3 in mosfets does not scale very well . on the other hand , tunnel fets ( tfets ) </S>",
    "<S> can , in principle , provide steeper switching @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , scaling tfets is even trickier than mosfets , since scaling affects both on- and off - states of the tfets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the tremendous improvement in processing power of transistors every few years linked to the dimension scaling and empirically described by moore s law has reached a dead end . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , it is shown here that 2d materials with anisotropic effective mass ( @xmath5 ) can be used to solve these problems and save moore s law .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig1]a and [ fig : fig1]b . 5 </S>",
    "<S> nm long channel gaas mosfet suffers significantly from sd leakage which reduces the gate control . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eq : tun1 ] ) shows the dependence of tunneling current through barrier on @xmath5 of the channel material . according to equ . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : tun1 ] ) , an apparent solution to the high transparency of channel barriers in short channel regime is a channel material with higher effective mass . @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> although high @xmath5 channel materials block sd tunneling effectively , they have a set of drawbacks too . </S>",
    "<S> quantum capacitance ( @xmath7 ) of channel material increases as a result of larger density of states ( dos ) and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the gate capacitance ( @xmath8 ) which is the net series capacitance of @xmath7 and oxide capacitance ( @xmath9 ) increases . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a larger @xmath5 translates into a larger switching delay ( @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 anisotropic effective mass can provide a solution to this problem with reducing @xmath7 by a factor of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this reduction of @xmath7 is the result of the decreased density of states ( @xmath13 ) in anisotropic materials : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are low and high effective masses of the channel material along its two main axes . </S>",
    "<S> if high @xmath5 axis of channel is aligned with transport direction and low @xmath5 axis is aligned with the confinement direction , both low transparency and small switching delay can be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> note that high @xmath5 along the channel increases the carriers decay rate through barrier exponentially , whereas low confinement @xmath5 reduces dos and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a 2d material such as phosphorene @xcite with anisotropic @xmath5 @xcite can provide an excellent switching performance in mosfets ensuring the continuation of moore s law to atomic dimensions .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.46     0.36     here , we discuss the scaling challenge of tfets . </S>",
    "<S> although tfets were intended to reduce the power consumption of transistors @xcite , scaling tfets below 10 nm is even more challenging than mosfets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the on - state and off - state tunneling currents ( i@xmath17 and i@xmath18 ) depend on the same device parameters @xcite . thus decreasing </S>",
    "<S> i@xmath18 would reduce i@xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> roughly , the on / off ratio of tfets depends on @xcite : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath2 are the tunneling distances in the on- and off - state respectively . @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) are the reduced effective mass and the bandgap of the channel material ( source - to - channel junction ) , respectively </S>",
    "<S> .    shrinking the channel length to few nanometers brings @xmath25 close to 1 and reduces i@xmath17/i@xmath18 significantly . </S>",
    "<S> one apparent solution can be a heterostructure channel where the term @xmath26 is much smaller than @xmath27 due to different materials used in the source and channel regions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , heterostructure tfets suffer from interface states which deteriorate their off - state performance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although homojunction tfets do not have the interface states , it is challenging to provide high on / off ratio especially below 6 nm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropic effective mass can also provide a solution for this challenge by setting source - channel junction along low @xmath5 axis of channel material and the channel barrier along high @xmath5 axis .    </S>",
    "<S> although , many novel materials and designs have been proposed to enhance the performance of tfets such as 2d material tfets @xcite , nitride heterostructures @xcite , dielectric engineering @xcite , there are not many proposals for solving the scaling challenge of tfets @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , a new tfet design is proposed to overcome the scaling challenge and enable downsizing to 2 nm channel lengths . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]a shows a novel tfet device structure to take advantage of anisotropic effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the gate is l - shaped . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig2]b depicts that the tunneling in the on - state occurs along the low @xmath5 axis of the channel enhancing the i@xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> however , the tunneling in the off - state occurs along the high @xmath5 axis and results in a very low i@xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this new tfet design can revive moore s law for sub-10 nm tfets .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> phosphorene nanoribbon has been chosen as the channel material since it has a large effective mass anisotropy in zigzag and armchair directions . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , multi - layer phosphorene provides a range of bandgap ( @xmath281.45 to 0.4ev @xcite ) suitable for transistor applications . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 of monolayer ( 1l- ) and bilayer ( 2l- ) phosphorene is about 1.45ev and 0.8ev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> since mosfets require larger @xmath29 for a smaller source - to - drain leakage , a monolayer phosphorene has been used here . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is more tricky in tfets which need optimized @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown previously that 2l - phosphorene has an optimum @xmath29 , and hence 2l has been chosen for tfets . </S>",
    "<S> hfo@xmath30 is used as the gate dielectric with an equivalent oxide thickness ( eot ) of 0.5 nm in both mosfets and tfets and i@xmath18 is set to @xmath31 .    </S>",

    "<S> accordingly , a high transport @xmath5 is not required for blocking this leakage current . </S>",
    "<S> actually , in long channel regime , a low transport @xmath5 can be beneficial and enhance the on - state performance of the transistor since it leads to a higher carrier injection velocity . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig4]d shows i@xmath17/i@xmath18 ratio of phosphorene nanoribbon mosfets as a function of @xmath2 along zigzag and armchair transport directions . although zigzag nanoribbon mosfets significantly outperform the armchair ones in short channels due to lower source - to - drain tunneling , armchair nanoribbon mosfets show a better performance in longer channels due to higher injection velocity . </S>",
    "<S> there is a critical channel length ( i.e. 6 nm in 1l - phosphorene ) in mosfets below which having a low @xmath5 becomes critical and above which a high @xmath5 is beneficial .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> the channel materials with anisotropic effective mass can be used to design transistors scalable to 1 - 2 nm channel lengths . in mosfets , the high effective mass along transport direction blocks the direct source to drain tunneling and low effective mass reduces the quantum capacitance and switching delay . on the other hand in tfets , a novel l - shaped gate design is proposed which can provide advantage of high tunneling rate in the on - state and low tunneling rate in off - state by engineering the tunneling paths along low and high effective mass directions . in summary , anisotropic effective mass can be used in an l - gate design to obtain large on / off ratio in an ultra - scaled homojunction tfet . </S>"
