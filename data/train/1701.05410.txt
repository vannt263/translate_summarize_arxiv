    "according to the earnshaw theorem  @xcite a ferromagnet can be stably levitated in a static magnetic field only when it is mechanically rotating about its magnetization axis .",
    "such a gyroscopic - based stabilization mechanism can be neatly observed with a levitron  @xcite .",
    "the earnshaw theorem does not account for the microscopic quantum origin of magnetization .",
    "for instance , a single neutral magnetic atom can be stably trapped in a static magnetic field by means of the larmor precession of its quantum magnetic moment  @xcite . in both the levitron and the atom , the magnetization ,",
    "initially anti - aligned to the magnetic field , adiabatically follows the local direction of the magnetic field , thereby confining the center - of - mass motion  @xcite .    in this article , we study the stability of a levitated single magnetic domain particle ( nanomagnet ) in a static magnetic field .",
    "the magnetization of the nanomagnet couples to its center - of - mass motion via the interaction with the external inhomogeneous magnetic field , and to its orientation via the magnetocrystalline anisotropy @xcite .",
    "the latter induces magnetic rigidity , namely its magnetic moment can not freely move with respect to a given orientation of the crystal structure of the nanomagnet .",
    "together with the quantum spin origin of the magnetization , given by the gyromagnetic relation , this leads to the well - known einstein - de haas effect @xcite .",
    "that is , a change of magnetization is accompanied by mechanical rotation in order to conserve total angular momentum .",
    "the einstein - de haas effect is boosted at small scales due to the small moment - of - inertia - to - magnetic - moment ratio @xcite .",
    "we shall argue that the quantum spin origin of magnetization opens the possibility to magnetically levitate a non - rotating nanomagnet in a static field configuration .",
    "indeed , we encounter two stable phases of different physical origin .",
    "the _ atom _ ( a ) phase appears at sufficiently large magnetic fields where the nanomagnet effectively behaves as a soft magnet , namely its magnetization can freely move with respect to its orientation .",
    "einstein - de haas _ ( edh ) phase appears at sufficiently small magnetic fields where the nanomagnet effectively behaves as a hard magnet , namely the magnetization sticks to the crystal .",
    "the edh phase requires the magnet to be sufficiently small .",
    "furthermore , we also recover the _ levitron _",
    "( l ) phase for a larger rotating magnet , which can be predicted without accounting for the quantum spin origin of the magnetization .",
    "such a rich stability phase diagram could be experimentally tested and opens the possibility to cool the several degrees of freedom of the nanomagnet in the stable phases to the quantum regime  @xcite .",
    "this article is structured as follows . in , we model a single magnetic domain nanoparticle in a static field .",
    "both a quantum and a classical description of the model is given .",
    "in we derive the stability criterion as a function of the physical parameters of the system . in",
    "we discuss the stability diagrams and the physical origin of the different stable phases .",
    "we draw our conclusions and discuss further directions in .",
    "we consider a single magnetic domain nanoparticle in an external static magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "the nanomagnet is modeled as a rigid sphere of radius @xmath1 , mass @xmath2 , and with a magnetic moment @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath0 is assumed to be approximately homogeneous within the volume of the sphere such that the interaction energy between @xmath3 and @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the center - of - mass position of the sphere ( point - dipole approximation ) .",
    "the exchange interaction between the magnetic dipoles inside a magnetic domain is assumed to be the strongest energy scale of the problem . under this assumption",
    ", @xmath6 can be approximated to be a constant .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the system are hence : ( i ) the center - of - mass motion ( described by 6 parameters ) , ( ii ) the rotational motion ( described by 6 parameters ) , and ( iii ) the magnetization dynamics ( described by 2 parameters ) @xcite .",
    "the orientation of the rigid sphere is represented by the three euler angles @xmath7 in the zyz parametrization @xcite , which specify the mutual orientation between the frame @xmath8 , fixed in the object and centered in its center of mass , and the frame @xmath9 , fixed in the laboratory . according to this convention the coordinate axes of the frame @xmath8 and the coordinate axes of the frame @xmath9",
    "are related through @xmath10 , where the transformation matrix reads @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the clockwise rotation of the coordinate frame ( passive rotation ) of an angle @xmath13 about the direction @xmath14 ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "hereafter latin indexes @xmath15 label the body frame axes while greek indexes @xmath16 label the laboratory frame axes .",
    "ferromagnetic materials exhibit magnetocrystalline anisotropy , namely they magnetize more easily in some directions than others , due to the interaction between the magnetic moment and the crystal structure of the material @xcite .",
    "this interaction determines preferred directions along which the magnetic energy of the system is minimized .",
    "we consider uniaxial anisotropy , for which the preferred direction is a single axis ( easy axis ) in the crystal . by choosing @xmath17 to be the easy axis ,",
    "the uniaxial anisotropy energy is given by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are , respectively , the anisotropy energy density and the volume of the nanomagnet .",
    "@xmath21 has two minima corresponding to @xmath3 being aligned or anti - aligned to @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath17 depends on @xmath22 , and hence @xmath21 couples the magnetization with the orientation of the nanomagnet .",
    "regarding @xmath0 , we consider the ioffe - pritchard field given by @xcite [ eq : ioffe_pritchard ]    ( ) = & - + & + ,    where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the three parameters characterizing the ioffe - pritchard trap , namely the bias , the gradient , and the curvature .",
    "this field , which is commonly used to trap magnetic atoms @xcite , is non - zero at its center ,  @xmath25 .    in summary , our model , whose",
    "physical parameters are listed in  , assumes a : single magnetic domain , rigid body , spherical shape , constant magnetization , uniaxial anisotropy , ioffe - pritchard magnetic field , and point - dipole approximation . in , we discuss these assumptions and the potential generalization of the model .",
    ".physical parameters of the model .",
    "whenever required , the following values are used : @xmath26 , @xmath27 \\text{j}/(\\text{tm}^3)$](where @xmath28 is the bohr magneton and amu is atomic mass unit ) , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the sm regime , where @xmath32 ( see .b ) , the coupling between the magnetization and the anisotropy is negligible . in this regime ,",
    "the magnetic moment undergoes a free larmor precession about the local magnetic field .",
    "this stabilizes the system in full analogy to magnetic trapping of neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "the borders of the a phase are approximately independent on the rotational state of the nanomagnet @xmath33 , as shown in .",
    "therefore , considering the case of a non - rotating nanomagnet , they can be analytically approximated as follows , see .",
    "the left border at low magnetic fields can be approximated by keeping only terms in @xmath34 up to zero order in @xmath35 and up to leading order in @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which is well justified in the sm regime at @xmath38 , see .b .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath39 , which using reads [ eq : b0_star2 ] b_c2 .",
    "@xmath40 approximates the lowest field bias for which stable levitation is possible in the a phase , see .",
    "the a phase extends up to the field bias @xmath41 , above which @xmath42 becomes imaginary .",
    "this is shown in the leftmost diagram in .b , while in the remaining panels it falls out of the @xmath43 interval shown .",
    "note that there is no upper limit in @xmath1 for the a phase .",
    "however recall that our model assumes a single magnetic domain nanomagnet , which most materials can only sustain for sizes up to hundred nanometers  @xcite .",
    "note that the dependence of @xmath40 and @xmath44 on the field gradient @xmath45 and the uniaxial anisotropy strength @xmath19 explains the qualitative behaviour of the a phase in .    in the limit of a vanishing magnetic anisotropy , @xmath46",
    ", the hamiltonian of the nanomagnet reads @xmath47 , where @xmath48 represents the hamiltonian describing a single magnetic atom of mass @xmath2 and spin @xmath49 in the external field @xmath0 @xcite . in the same limit ,",
    "the system is described classically by the lagrangian @xmath50 obtained from @xmath51 by setting @xmath52 . in this limit",
    ", the linear stability analysis leads to @xmath53 ( as in the general case ) and to [ eq : poly_sm ] p^_t ( ) = a_0^ + a_1^+ a_2^^2 + a_3^ ^3 , whose coefficients given in are , as expected , independent on @xmath33 and @xmath54 , namely on the rotational state of the nanomagnet . this leads to the stability diagram shown in the leftmost panel in .a , whose left border coincides with .",
    "note that @xmath55 is only a third order polynomial because the rotational dynamics do not affect the stability of the system .",
    "the only relevant degrees of freedom for the stability are thus the magnetic moment and the center - of - mass motion ( 8 independent parameters ) .      in the lhm regime ,",
    "the magnetic moment can be considered to be fixed along the easy axis ( @xmath56 ) and the contribution of the spin to the total angular momentum can be neglected due to the large dimension of the nanomagnet ( @xmath57 ) , see .b . in this respect",
    ", the nanomagnet behaves in good approximation like a classical levitron .",
    "the dynamics in this regime can be approximately described by the hamiltonian [ eq : ham_levitron ] _",
    "= + ^2 - _ 3 ( ) ( ) , which is obtained from @xmath58 by taking the limit @xmath59 ( magnetization frozen along the anisotropy axis ) and by using @xmath60 .",
    "the latter treats the magnetization classicaly , namely @xmath61 is a scalar quantity instead of a quantum spin operator .",
    "the classical description is given in this limit by the lagrangian [ eq : ll_lhm_lagrangian ]    _ = & + & + + ( ) ,    where @xmath62 for a magnetic moment frozen along the anisotropy axis .",
    "the linear stability analysis applied to this limit leads to the polynomials @xmath53 ( as in the general case ) and @xmath63 , where its coefficients are defined in .",
    "the linear stability diagram derived from @xmath53 and @xmath64 corresponds to the l phase of the lhm regime in , thus showing that stable levitation in this regime requires mechanical rotation .",
    "furthermore , in this limit the stability region is symmetric with respect to clock- or counterclockwise rotation , as in the classical levitron @xcite .    to conclude this section ,",
    "let us compare the description of the magnetic moment in the approximated models of the lhm and the shm regimes .",
    "the lhm and shm both describe a nanomagnet with a large magnetic rigidity whose magnetic moment can be approximated to be frozen along the easy axis @xmath17 . in the lhm regime , due to the negligible role played by the macrospin angular momentum ( @xmath65 ) , the magnetic moment is modeled as @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a classical scalar quantity . in the shm regime , on the other hand , the role of the spin angular momentum is crucial ( @xmath66 ) , and the quantum origin of the nanomagnet s magnetic moment has to be taken into account .",
    "the magnetic moment is thus given by @xmath67\\bold{e}_3({\\hat{\\w}})$ ] .",
    "this crucial difference is manifested in the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial , see . in the shm regime",
    "the rotational frequency @xmath33 is shifted by @xmath54 , thus retaining the contribution of the spin angular momentum @xmath68 to the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "in essence , the quantum spin origin of the magnetization plays the same role as mechanical rotation , a manifestation of the einstein - de haas effect .",
    "in conclusion , we discussed the linear stability of a single magnetic domain nanosphere in a static external ioffe - pritchard magnetic field at the equilibrium point illustrated in .a .",
    "this corresponds to a nanomagnet at the center of the field , with the magnetic moment parallel to the anisotropy axis , anti - aligned to the magnetic field , and mechanically spinning with a frequency @xmath69 .",
    "we derived a stability criterion given by the roots of both a second order polynomial @xmath53 and of a fifth order polynomial @xmath70 .",
    "eigenvalues with zero ( non - zero ) real component correspond to stability ( instability ) .",
    "this stability criterion is derived both with a quantum description and a ( phenomenological ) classical description of the nanomagnet .",
    "apart from the known gyroscopic - stabilized levitation ( levitron l phase ) , we found two additional stable phases , arising from the quantum mechanical origin of the magnetization , @xmath71 , which surprisingly ( according to earnshaw s theorem ) allow to stably levitate a non - rotating magnet .",
    "the atom a phase appears at a high magnetic bias field ( @xmath72 ) , where despite the magnetocrystalline anisotropy the magnetic moment freely precesses along the local direction of the magnetic field .",
    "the stability mechanism is thus fully analogous to the magnetic trapping of neutral atoms @xcite .",
    "the einstein - de haas edh phase arises at a low magnetic bias field ( @xmath73 ) , where the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy interaction dominates the magnetization s dynamics .",
    "the magnetic moment is thus frozen along the easy axis and can be modeled as @xmath74\\bold{e}_3({\\hat{\\w}})$ ] . in this case",
    "the quantum spin origin of @xmath3 is crucial to stabilize the levitation of a small nanomagnet through the einstein - de haas effect . as the size of the nanomagnet increases , the contribution of the spin angular momentum becomes negligible due to the increasing moment - of - inertia - to - magnetic - moment ratio and the classical levitron behavior",
    "is recovered .    to derive these results , we assumed a : ( i ) single magnetic domain , ( ii ) macrospin approximation , ( iii ) rigid body , ( iv ) sphere , ( v ) uniaxial anisotropy , ( vi ) ioffe - pritchard magnetic field , ( vii ) point - dipole approximation , ( viii ) absence of gravity , and ( ix ) dissipation - free dynamics for the system . while not addressed in this article , it would be very interesting to relax some of these assumptions and study their impact on the stability diagrams .",
    "for instance , levitating a multi - domain magnet could allow to study the effects of the interactions between different domains on the stability of the system .",
    "it would be particularly interesting to explore if the a phase persists for a macroscopic multi - domain magnet at sufficiently high magnetic fields . in this scenario and depending on the size of the magnet , not only assumption ( i ) and ( ii ) , but also ( iii ) , ( v ) , ( vii ) , ( viii ) and ( ix ) should be carefully revisited .",
    "one could use the exquisite isolation from the environment obtained in levitation in high vacuum to study in - domain spin dynamics beyond the macrospin approximation .",
    "generalization to different shapes and magnetocrystalline anisotropies would allow to investigate the shape - dependence of the stable phases , as done for the levitron  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one could explore the presence of multi - stability with other magnetocrystalline anisotropies that contain more than a single easy axis .",
    "levitation in different magnetic field configurations , such as quadrupole fields , might be used to further study the role of @xmath43 ( crucial for the levitation of neutral magnetic atoms @xcite ) in the levitation of a nanomagnet . in particular , to discern whether stable levitation can occur in a position where the local magnetic field is zero .",
    "the effect of noise and dissipation on the stability of the system might not only enrich the stability diagram , but also play a crucial role in any experiments aiming at controlling the dynamics of a levitated nanomagnet  @xcite .",
    "we remark that linear stability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the stability of the system at long time scales .",
    "a thorough analysis of the stability of a nanomagnet in a magnetic field under realistic conditions might demand to consider non - linear dynamics .",
    "to conclude , we remark that one could consider to cool the fluctuations of the system in the stable phases to the quantum regime  @xcite .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the system could then be described as coupled quantum harmonic oscillators using the bosonization tools given in @xcite .",
    "one could then study the quantum properties ( entanglement and squeezing ) of the relevant eigenstates of the quadratic bosonic hamiltonian  @xcite , and exploit the rich physics of magnetically levitated nanomagnets in the quantum regime .",
