    "the problem of interacting models is to identify observational features which can unambiguously be attributed to a certain coupling .",
    "interactions may provide corrections to uncoupled dark - sector models .",
    "but there are also models for which the accelerated expansion is an interaction phenomenon .",
    "moreover , scenarios with nongravitational couplings in the dark sector may result in a future evolution of the universe which is different from that of the @xmath0cdm model .",
