    "discovered by @xcite , u geminorum is the prototype of a subclass of dwarf novae , a descriptive term suggested by @xcite due to the small scale similarity of the outbursts in these objects to those of novae .    after the work by @xcite , who found u  gem to be a single - lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period around 4.25  hr , and from the studies by @xcite , who establish the eclipsing nature of this binary , @xcite and @xcite , established the classical model for cataclysmic variable stars .",
    "the model includes a white dwarf primary surrounded by a disc accreted from a roche - lobe filling late - type secondary star .",
    "the stream of material , coming through the l@xmath12 point intersects the edge of the disc producing a bright spot , which can contribute a large fraction of the visual flux .",
    "the bright spot is observed as a strong hump in the light curves of u gem and precedes a partial eclipse of the accretion disk and bright spot themselves ( the white dwarf is not eclipsed in this object ) .    a mean recurrence time for u gem outbursts of @xmath13 118 days , with @xmath14m@xmath15=5 and outburst width of 12  d ,",
    "was first found by @xcite .",
    "however , recent analysis shows that the object has a complex outburst behavior @xcite .",
    "@xcite , using the aavso data on the 1985 outburst , has discovered the presence of super - humps , a fact that challenges the current theories of super - outbursts and super - humps for long period system with mass ratios above 1/3 .",
    "the latter author also points out the fact that calculations of the radius of the disc ",
    "obtained from the separation of the emission peaks @xcite in quiescence  are in disagreement with the calculations of the disc radii obtained from the photometric eclipse data @xcite .",
    "several radial velocity studies have been conducted since the first results published by @xcite . in the visible spectral range , where the secondary star has not been detected , their results are mainly based on spectroscopic radial velocity analysis of the emission lines arising from the accretion disc @xcite .",
    "in other wavelengths , works are based on absorption lines : in the near - infrared , on the na i doublet from the secondary star @xcite and in the ultraviolet , on lines coming from the white dwarf itself @xcite .",
    "although the research work on u gem has been of paramount importance in our understanding of cataclysmic variables , the fact that it is a partially - eclipsed and  in the visual range  a single - lined spectroscopic binary , make the determination of its physical parameters difficult to achieve through precise measurements of the semi - amplitudes @xmath16 and of the inclination angle @xmath17 of the orbit .",
    "spectroscopic results of @xmath16 differ in the ultraviolet , visual and infrared ranges .",
    "therefore , auxiliary assumptions have been used to derive its more fundamental parameters @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a value of @xmath18 , obtained from our high - dispersion echelle spectra , which is in agreement with the ultraviolet results , and of @xmath19 from a new method applicable to optical spectroscopy . by chance ,",
    "the system was observed at a peculiar low state , when the classical hot spot was absent .",
    "u geminorum was observed in 1999 , january 15 with the echelle spectrograph at the f/7.5 cassegrain focus of the 2.1 m telescope of the observatorio astrnomico nacional at san pedro mrtir , b.c .",
    "a thomson 2048@xmath202048 ccd was used to cover the spectral range between @xmath215200 and @xmath219100  , with spectral resolution of r=18,000 .",
    "an echellette grating of 150 l / mm , with blaze around 7000   , was used .",
    "the observations were obtained at quiescence ( @xmath22 ) , about 20 d after a broad outburst ( data provided by the aavso : www.aavso.org ) . the spectra show a strong h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "no absorption features were detected from the secondary star .",
    "a first complete orbital cycle was covered through twenty - one spectra , each with 10  min exposure time .",
    "thirteen further spectra were subsequently acquired with an exposure of 5  min each .",
    "the latter cover an additional half orbital period .",
    "the heliocentric mid - time of each observation is shown in column one in table  [ tab : radvel ] .",
    "the flux standard hr17520 and the late spectral m star hr3950 were also observed on the same night .",
    "data reduction was carried out with the iraf package .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated using a th - ar lamp and the standard star was also used to properly subtract the telluric absorption lines using the iraf routine _",
    "in this section we derive radial velocities from the prominent h@xmath0 emission line observed in u gem , first by measuring the peaks , secondly by using a method based on a cross - correlating technique , and thirdly by using the standard double - gaussian technique designed to measure only the wings of the line . in the case of the secondary star",
    ", we were unable to detect any single absorption line in the individual spectra ; therefore it was not possible to use any standard method .",
    "however , here we propose and use a new method , based on a co - adding technique , to derive the semi - amplitude of the orbital radial velocity of the companion star . in this section",
    ", we compare our results with published values for both components in the binary .",
    "we first discuss the basic mathematical method used here to derive the orbital parameters and its limitation in the context of cataclysmic variables ; then we present our results for the orbital parameters  calculated from the different methods  and finally discuss an improved ephemeris for u gem .      to find the orbital parameters of the components in a cataclysmic variable  in which no eccentricity is expected @xcite",
    " we use an equation of the form @xmath23,\\ ] ]    where @xmath24 are the observed radial velocities as measured from the emission lines in the accretion disc or from the absorption lines of the red star ; @xmath25 is the systemic velocity ; @xmath26 are the corresponding semi - amplitudes derived from the radial velocity curve ; @xmath27 is the heliocentric julian time of the inferior conjunction of the companion ; and @xmath28 is the orbital period of the binary .    a minimum least - squares sinusoidal fit is run , which uses initial values for the four ( @xmath28 , @xmath25 , @xmath29 , and @xmath27 ) orbital parameters .",
    "the program allows for one or more of these variables to be fixed , i.e. they can be set to constant values in the initial parameters file .",
    "if the orbital period is not previously known , a frequency search  using a variety of methods for evenly- or unevenly - sampled time series data @xcite  may be applied to the measured radial velocities in order to obtain an initial value for @xmath28 , which is then used in the minimum least - squares sinusoidal fit .",
    "if the time coverage of the observations is not sufficient or is uneven , period aliases may appear and their values have to be considered in the least - squares fits .",
    "a tentative orbital period is selected by comparing the quality of each result . in these cases ,",
    "additional radial velocity observations should be sought , until the true orbital period is found unequivocally .",
    "time series photometric observations are usually helpful to find orbital modulations and are definitely important in establishing the orbital period of eclipsing binaries . in the case of u gem ,",
    "the presence of eclipses and the ample photometric coverage since the early work of @xcite , has permitted to establish its orbital period with a high degree of accuracy @xcite . although in eclipsing binaries a zero phase is also usually determined , in the case of u  gem the variable positions of the hot spot and stream , causes the zero point to oscillate , as mentioned by the latter authors .",
    "accurate spectroscopic observations are necessary to correctly establish the time when the secondary star is closest to earth , i.e in inferior conjunction .",
    "further discussion on this subject is given in section  [ ephem ] .    to obtain the real semi - amplitudes of the binary , i.e k@xmath30=k@xmath31 ,",
    "some reasonable auxiliary assumptions are made .",
    "first , that the measurements of the emission lines , produced in the accretion disc , are free from distortions and accurately follow the orbital motion of the unseen white dwarf .",
    "second , that the profiles of the measured absorption lines are symmetric , which implies that the brightness at the surface of the secondary star is the same for all its longitudes and latitudes .",
    "certainly , a hot spot in the disc or irradiation in the secondary from the energy sources related to the primary will invalidate either the first , the second , or both assumptions .",
    "corrections may be introduced if these effects are present . in the case of u gem ,",
    "a three - body correction was introduced by @xcite in order to account for the radial velocity distortion produced by the hot spot , and a correction to heating effects on the face of the secondary star facing the primary was applied by @xcite before equating @xmath32 .    as initial values in our least - squared sinusoidal",
    "fits , we use @xmath33 and @xmath34 from @xcite , a systemic velocity of 42 km s@xmath3 from @xcite , and k@xmath35 km s@xmath3 and k@xmath36 km s@xmath3 from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in our calculations ,",
    "the orbital period was set fixed at the above mentioned value , since our observations have a very limited time coverage .",
    "this allow us to increase the precision for the other three parameters",
    ".    .measured h@xmath0 radial velocities .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , > , > \" , ]      in this section we compare three methods for determining the radial velocity of the primary star , based on measurements of the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "although , as we will see in the next subsections , the last method results in far better accuracy and agrees with the ultraviolet results , we have included all of them here because the first method essentially provides an accurate way to determine the separations of the blue and red peaks , which is an indicator of the outer radius of the disc @xcite , and the second yields a @xmath37 value much closer to that obtained from uv results than any other published method .",
    "this cross - correlation method might be worthwhile to consider for its use in other objects .",
    "furthermore , as we will see in the discussion , all three methods yield a consistent value of the systemic velocity , which is essential to the understanding of other parameters in the binary system .    to match the signal to noise ratio of the first twenty - one spectra , we have co - added , in pairs , the thirteen 5-minute exposures .",
    "the last three spectra were added to form two different spectra , in order to avoid losing the last single spectrum . a handicap to this approach is that , due to the large read - out time of the thomson ccd , we are effectively smearing the phase coverage of the co - added spectra to nearly 900  s. however , the mean heliocentric time was accordingly corrected for each sum .",
    "this adds to a total sample of twenty - eight 600  s spectra .",
    "we have measured the position of the peaks using a double - gaussian fit , with their separation , width and position as free parameters .",
    "the results yield a mean half - peak separation @xmath38 of about 460  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the average value of the velocities of the red and blue peaks , for each spectrum , is shown in column 3 of table  [ tab : radvel ] .",
    "we then applied our nonlinear least - squares fit to these radial velocities .",
    "the obtained orbital parameters are shown in column 2 of table  [ orbparam ] .",
    "the numbers in parentheses after the zero point results are the evaluated errors of the last digit . we will use this notation for large numbers throughout the paper .",
    "the radial velocities are also shown in figure  [ fig : dob - peak ] , folded with the orbital period and the time of inferior conjunction adopted in the section  [ ephem ] .",
    "the solid lines in this figure correspond to sinusoidal fits using the derived parameters in our program .",
    "although we have not independently tabulated the measured velocities of the blue and red peaks , they are shown in figure  [ fig : dob - peak ] together with their average .",
    "the semi - amplitudes of the plotted curves are 154 km s@xmath3 and 167 km s@xmath3 for the blue and red peaks , respectively .    .",
    "the curve at the middle is the mean from blue ( bottom curve ) and red ( top curve ) . ]",
    "template near phase 0.02 .",
    "the half - separation of the peaks has a value of 470 km  s@xmath3 . ]",
    "we have also cross - correlated the h@xmath0 line in our spectra with a template constructed as follows : first , we selected a spectrum from the first observed orbital cycle close to phase 0.02 when , in the case of our observations , we should expect a minimum distortion in the double - peaked line due to asymmetric components ( see section  [ tom ] ) .",
    "the blue peak in this spectrum is slightly stronger than the red one .",
    "this is probably caused by the hot spot near the @xmath11 point ( see section  [ ugemb ] ) , which might be visible at this phase due to the fact that the binary has an inclination angle smaller than 70 degrees .",
    "the half - separation of the peaks is 470 km s@xmath3 , a value similar to that measured in a spectrum taken during the same orbital phase in next cycle .",
    "the chosen spectrum was then highly smoothed to minimize high - frequency correlations .",
    "the resulting template is shown in figure [ fig : halfxc ] .",
    "a radial velocity for the template was derived from the wavelength measured at the dip between the two peaks and corrected to give an heliocentric velocity .",
    "the iraf _ fxc _ task was then used to derive the radial velocities , which are shown in column 4 of table  [ tab : radvel ] . as in the previous section ,",
    "we have fitted the radial velocities with our nonlinear least - squares fit algorithm .",

    "we refer to this paper for the details on the interpretation of our results .",
    "we have used the _ convolve _",
    "routine from the iraf _ rvsao _ package , kindly made available to us by thorstensen ( private communication ) .",
    "the double peaked h@xmath0 emission line  with a separation of about @xmath39  shows broad wings reaching up to @xmath40 from the line center . unlike the case of low resolution spectra  where for over - sampled data the fitting is made with individual gaussians having a fwhm of about one resolution element  in our spectra , with resolution @xmath13 0.34 @xmath41",
    ", such gaussians would be inadequately narrow , as they will cover only a very small region in the wings . to measure the wings appropriately and , at the same time , avoid possible low velocity asymmetric features",
    ", we must select a @xmath42 value which fits the line regions corresponding to disc velocities from about 700 to 1000 @xmath43 .    as a first step",
    ", we evaluated the width of the gaussians by setting this as a free parameter from 10 to 40 pixels and for a wide range of gaussian separations ( between 180 and 280 pixels ) . for each run",
    ", we applied a nonlinear least - squares fit of the computed radial velocities to sinusoids of the form described in section  [ orbparcal ] .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : diag1 ] , in particular for three different gaussian separations : @xmath44 , 230 and 280 pixels .",
    "these correspond to the low and upper limits as well as to the value for a preferred solution , all of which are self - consistent with the second step ( see below ) . in the bottom panel of the figure",
    "we have plotted the overall rms value for each least - squares fit , as this parameter is very sensitive to the selected gaussian separations . as expected at this high spectral resolution , the parameters in the diagram change rapidly for low values of @xmath42 , and there are even cases when no solution was found . at low values of @xmath45 ( e.g. crosses )",
    "there are no solutions for widths narrower than 20 pixels .",
    "the rms values increase rapidly with width , while the @xmath46 , @xmath25 and phase shift values differ strongly from the other cases . for higher values of @xmath45 ( open circles )",
    "we obtain lower values for @xmath46 , but the rms results are still large , in particular for intermediate values of the width of the gaussians . for the middle solution ( dots ) the results are comparable with those for large @xmath45 values , but the rms is much lower .",
    "similar results were found for other intermediate values of @xmath45 , and they all converge to a minimum rms for a width of 26 pixels at @xmath47 pixels .    for the second step",
    "we have fixed the width to a value of 26  @xmath41 and ran the double - gaussian program for a range of @xmath45 separations , from about 60 to 120 @xmath41 .",
    "the results obtained are shown in figure  [ fig : diag2 ] .    , corresponding to a @xmath48 . ]",
    "if only an asymmetric low velocity component is present , the semi - amplitude should decrease asymptotically as @xmath45 increases , until @xmath49 reaches the correct value .",
    "here we observe such behavior , although for larger values of @xmath45 , there is a @xmath49 increase for values of @xmath45 up to @xmath50 , before it decreases strongly with high values of @xmath45 .",
    "this behavior might be due to the fact that we are observing a narrow hot - spot near the @xmath11 point ( see section  [ tom ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , as expected , the @xmath46 vs @xmath45 curve has a change in slope , at a value of @xmath45 for which the individual gaussians have reached the velocity width of the line at the continuum . for larger values of @xmath45 the velocity measurements",
    "become dominated by noise . for low values of @xmath45 ,",
    "the phase shift usually gives spurious results , although in our case it approaches a stable value around 0.015 .",
    "we believe this value reflects the difference between the eclipse ephemeris , which is based mainly on the eclipse of the hot spot , and the true inferior conjunction of the secondary star .",
    "this problem is further discussed in section  [ tom ] . finally , we must point out that the systemic velocity smoothly increases up to a maximum of about 40  km  s@xmath3 at gaussian separation of nearly 42   , while the best results , as seen from the figure , are obtained for @xmath45  =  31 .",
    "this discrepancy may be also be related to the narrow hot - spot near the @xmath11 point and might be due to the phase - shift between the hot - spot eclipse and the true inferior conjunction .",
    "this problem will also be address in section  [ ephem ] .",
    "the radial velocities , corresponding to the adopted solution , are shown in column 5 of table  [ tab : radvel ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : velrad ] , while the corresponding orbital parameters  obtained from the nonlinear least - squares fit  are given in column 4 of table  [ orbparam ] .    ) .",
    "the solid line , close to the points , correspond to the solution with @xmath51 ( see text ) , while the large amplitude line correspond to the solution found for @xmath1 ( see section  [ secon ] ) . ]      we were unable to detect single features from the secondary star in any individual spectra , after careful correction for telluric lines .",
    "in particular we found no radial velocity results using a standard cross - correlation technique near the nai @xmath52 doublet .",
    "as we will see below , this doublet was very weak compared with previous observations @xcite .",
    "we have been able , however , to detect the nai doublet and the tio head band around @xmath217050    with a new technique , which enables us to derive the semi - amplitude @xmath53 of the secondary star velocity curve .",
    "we first present here the general method for deriving the semi - amplitude and then apply it to u gem , using not only the absorption features but the @xmath54 emission as well .      in many cataclysmic variables",
    "the secondary star is poorly visible , or even absent , in the optical spectral range .",
    "consequently , no @xmath56 measurements are feasible for this component . among these systems",
    "are dwarf novae with orbital periods under 0.25 days , for which it is thought that the disc luminosity dominates over the luminosity of the roche - lobe filling secondary , whose brightness depends on the orbital period of the binary @xcite . for such binaries ,",
    "the orbital parameters have been derived only for the white - dwarf- accretion disc system , in a way similar to that described in section  [ orbparcal ] .    in order to determine a value of @xmath53 from a set of spectra of a cataclysmic variable , for which the orbital period and time of inferior conjunction have been already determined from the emission lines , we propose to reverse the process :",
    "derive @xmath57 using @xmath58 as the initial value for the semi - amplitude , and set the values of @xmath59 and @xmath27 , derived from the emission lines , as constants .",
    "the initial value for the systemic velocity is set to zero , and its final value may be calculated later ( see below ) .",
    "the individual spectra are then _ co - added _ in the frame of reference of the secondary star , i.e. by doppler - shifting the spectra using the calculated @xmath60 from the equation given in section  [ orbparcal ] , and then add them together .",
    "hereinafter we will refer to this procedure as the _ co - phasing process_. ideally , as the proposed @xmath58 is changed through a range of possible values , there will be a one for which the _ co - phased _",
    "spectral features associated with the absorption spectrum will have an optimal signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "in fact , this will also be the case for any emission line features associated with the red star , if present . in a way",
    ", this process works in a similar fashion as the double gaussian fitting used in the previous section , provided that adequate criteria are set in order to select the best value for @xmath53 .",
    "we propose three criteria or tests that , for late type stars , may be used with this method : the first one consists in analyzing the behavior of the measured depths or widths of a well identified absorption line in the _ co - phased _",
    "spectra , as a function of the proposed @xmath58 ; one would expect that the width of the line will show a minimum and its depth a maximum value at the optimal solution .",
    "this method could be particularly useful for k - type stars which have strong single metallic lines like ca i and fe i. the second criterion is based upon measurements of the slope of head - bands , like that of tio at @xmath217050   .",
    "it should be relevant to short period systems , with low mass m - type secondaries with spectra featuring strong molecular bands . in this case",
    "one could expect that the slope of the head - band will be a function of @xmath58 , and will have a maximum negative value at the best solution .",
    "a third test is to measure the strength of a narrow emission arising from the secondary .",
    "this emission , if present , would be particularly visible in the _ co - phased _ spectrum and will have minimum width and maximum height at the best selected semi - amplitude @xmath58 .",
    "we have tested these three methods by means of an artificial spectrum with simulated narrow absorption lines , a tio - like head band and a narrow emission line .",
    "the spectrum with these artificial features was then doppler shifted using pre - established inferior conjunction phase and orbital period , to produce a series of test spectra .",
    "an amount of random gaussian noise was added to each doppler shifted spectrum , sufficient to mask the artificial features .",
    "we then proceeded to apply the _ co - phasing process _ to recover our pre - determined orbital values .",
    "all three criteria reproduced back the original set of values , as long as the random noise amplitude was of the same order of magnitude as the strength of the _ clean _ artificial features .",
    "we have applied the above - mentioned criteria to u gem .",
    "the time of the inferior conjunction of the secondary and the orbital period were taken from section  [ ephem ] . to attain the best signal to noise ratio we have used all the 28 observed spectra .",
    "although they span over slightly more than 1.5 orbital periods , any departure from a real @xmath1 value will not depend on selecting data in exact multiples of the orbital period , as any possible deviation from the real semi - amplitude will already be present in one complete orbital period and will depend mainly on the intrinsic intensity distribution of the selected feature around the secondary itself ( also see below the results for @xmath25 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : sodcor ] shows the application of the first test to the nai doublet @xmath61  8183,8195   .",
    "the spectra were _ co - phased _ varying @xmath58 between 250 to 450 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the line depth of the blue and red components of the doublet ( stars and open circles , respectively ) , as well as their mean value ( dots ) are shown in the diagram .",
    "we find a best solution for @xmath1  =  310  @xmath62  5  km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the error has been estimated from the intrinsic modulation of the solution curve .",
    "as it approaches its maximum value , the line depth value oscillates slightly , but in the same way for both lines .",
    "a similar behavior was present when low signal to noise features were used on the artificial spectra process described above .",
    "figure  [ fig : sodspec ] shows the _ co - phased _ spectrum of the nai doublet of our best solution for @xmath1 .",
    "these lines appear very weak as compared with those reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have also measured the gamma velocity from the co - phased spectrum by fitting a double - gaussian to the na  i doublet ( dotted line in figure  [ fig : sodcor ] ) and find a mean value @xmath63 10 km s@xmath3 ( corrected to the heliocentric standard of motion ) .",
    "we did a similar calculation for @xmath25 by _ co - phasing _ the selected spectra used in section  [ tom ] , covering a full cycle only .",
    "the results were very similar to those obtained by using all spectra .",

    "the solution curve oscillates strongly near values between 250 and 350 @xmath65 .",
    "we believe that the signal to noise ratio in our spectra is too poor for this test and that more observations , accumulated during several orbital cycles , have to be obtained in order to attain a reliable result using this method .",
    "however , we have co - phased our spectra for @xmath1  =  310 km  s@xmath3 , with the results shown in figure  [ fig : tioband ] .",
    "the tio band is clearly seen while the noise is prominent , particulary along the slope of the head - band .",
    "we have used this co - added spectrum to compare it with several late - type m stars extracted from the published data by @xcite fitted to our _ co - phased _ spectrum .",
    "a gray continuum has been added to the comparison spectra in order to compensate for the fill - in effect arising from the other light sources in the system , so as to obtain the best fit . in particular , we show in the same figure the fits when two close candidates  gj406 ( m6  v , upper panel ) and gj402 ( m4 - 5  v , lower panel )  are used .",
    "the best fit is obtained for the m6  v star , to which we have added a 95 percent continuum . for the m4 - 5  v star",
    "the fit is poor , as we observe a flux excess around 7000   and a stronger tio head - band .",
    "increasing the grey flux contribution will fit the tio head band , but will result in a larger excess at the 7000   region . on the other hand ,",
    "the fit with the m6  v star is much better all along the spectral interval .",
    "there are a number of publications which assign to u  gem spectral types m4 @xcite , m5 @xcite and possibly as far as m5.5 @xcite . even in the case",
    "that the spectral type of the secondary star were variable , its spectral classification is still incompatible with its mass determination @xcite .",
    "for the third test , we have selected the region around h@xmath0 , as in the individual spectra we see evidence of a narrow spot , which is very well defined in our spectrum near orbital phase 0.5 . in this test we have _ co - phased _ the spectra as before , and have adopted as the test parameter the peak intensity around the emission line .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : hotflux ] . a clear and smooth maximum is obtained for @xmath58  =  310  @xmath62  3  km  s@xmath3 . the co - phased spectrum obtained from this solution",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : maxiflux ] .",
    "the double - peak structure has been completely smeared  as expected when co - adding in the reference frame of the secondary star , as opposed to that of the primary star- and instead we observe a narrow and strong peak at the center of the line .",
    "we have also fitted the peak to find the radial velocity of the spot .",
    "we find @xmath66 10 km  s@xmath3 , compatible with the gamma velocity derived from the radial velocity analysis of the emission line , @xmath67 2 km  s@xmath3 ( see section  [ hdgram ] ) .",
    "this is a key result for the determination of the true systemic velocity and can be compared with the values derived from the secondary star ( see section  [ discus ] ) .",
    "spectra as a function of @xmath58 ]     spectrum for @xmath68 . ]",
    "as mentioned in section  [ orbparcal ] , the presence of eclipses in u gem and an ample photometric coverage during 30 years has permitted to establish , with a high degree of accuracy , the value of orbital period . this has been discussed in detail by @xcite . however , as pointed by these authors , this object shows erratic variations in the timing of the photometric mid - eclipse that may be caused either by orbital period changes , variations in the position of the hot spot , or they may even be the consequence of the different methods of measuring of the eclipse phases .",
    "a variation in position and intensity of the gas stream will also contribute to such changes .",
    "a date for the zero phase determined independently from spectroscopic measurements would evidently be desirable .",
    "@xcite discuss two spectroscopic measurements by @xcite and @xcite , and conclude that the spectroscopic inferior conjunction of the secondary star occurs about 0.016 in phase prior to the mean photometric zero phase .",
    "there are two published spectroscopic studies @xcite , as well as one in this paper , that could be used to confirm this result .",
    "unfortunately there is no radial velocity analysis in the former paper , nor in the excellent doppler imaging paper by @xcite based on their original observations .",
    "however , the results by @xcite are of particular interest since he finds the spectroscopic conjunction in agreement with the time of the eclipse when using the photometric ephemerides by @xcite , taken from @xcite .",
    "the latter authors introduce a small quadratic term which is consistent with the o - c oscillations shown in @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to compare results derived from emission lines to those obtained from absorption lines , especially if they are based on different ephemerides .",
    "furthermore , the contamination on the timing of the spectroscopic conjunction  either caused by a hot spot , by gas stream or by irradiation on the secondary  has not been properly evaluated . however , since our observations were made at a time when the hot spot in absent ( or , at least , is along the line between the two components in the binary ) and the disc was very symmetric ( see section  [ tom ] ) , we can safely assume that in our case , the photometric and spectroscopic phases must coincide .",
    "if we then take the orbital period derived by @xcite and use the zero point value derived from our measurements of the h@xmath0 wings , ( section  [ hdgram ] ) , we can improve the ephemeris :    @xmath69    for the inferior conjunction of the secondary star .",
    "these ephemeris are used throughout this paper for all our phase folded diagrams and doppler tomography .",
    "doppler tomography is a useful and powerful tool to study the material orbiting the white dwarf , including the gas stream coming from the secondary star as well as emission regions arising from the companion itself .",
    "it uses the emission line profiles observed as a function of the orbital phase to reconstruct a two - dimensional velocity map of the emitting material .",
    "a detailed formulation of this technique can be found in @xcite .",
    "a careful interpretation of these velocity maps has to be made , as the main assumption invoked by tomography is that all the observed material is in the orbital plane and is visible at all times .    the doppler tomography , derived here from the h@xmath0 emission line in u  gem ,",
    "was constructed using the code developed by @xcite .",
    "our observations of the object cover 1.5 orbital cycles . consequently  to avoid disparities on the intensity of the trailed and reconstructed spectra , as well as on the tomographic map  we have carefully selected spectra covering a full cycle only . for this purpose",
    "we discarded the first 3 spectra ( which have the largest airmass ) and used only 18 spectra out of the first 21 , 600  s exposures , starting with the spectrum at orbital phase 0.88 and ending with the one at phase 0.86 ( see table  [ tab : radvel ] ) .",
    "in addition , in generating the tomography map we have excluded the spectra taken during the partial eclipse of the accretion disc ( phases between 0.95 and 0.05 ) .",
    "the original and reconstructed trailed spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : spec2 ] .",
    "they show the sinusoidal variation of the blue and read peaks , which are strong at all phases . the typical s - wave is also seen showing the same simple sinusoidal variation , but shifted by 0.5 in orbital phase with respect to the double - peaks .",
    "the doppler tomogram is shown in figure  [ fig : doptom ] ; as customary , the oval represents the roche - lobe of the secondary and the solid lines the keplerian ( upper ) and ballistic ( lower ) trajectories .",
    "the tomogram reveals a disc reaching to the distance of to the inner lagrangian point in most phases .",
    "a compact and strong emission is seen close to the center of velocities of the secondary star .",
    "a blow - up of this region is shown in figure  [ fig : spottom ] . both maps",
    "have been constructed using the parameters shown at the top of the diagrams and a @xmath25 velocity of 34 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "the velocity resolution of the map near the secondary star is about 10 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath70 position of the hot - spot ( in km  s@xmath3 ) is ( -50,305 ) , within the uncertainties .",
    "the tomography shown in figure  [ fig : doptom ] is very different from what we expected to find and from what has been observed by other authors .",
    "we find a very symmetric full disc , reaching close to the inner lagrangian point and a compact bright spot also close to the l@xmath12 point , instead of a complex system like that observed by @xcite , who find u  gem at a stage when the doppler tomographs show : emission at low velocity close to the center of mass ; a transient narrow absorption in the balmer lines ; as well as two distinct spots , one very narrow and close in velocity to the accretion disc near the impact region and another much broader , located between the ballistic and keplerian trajectories .",
    "they present also tentative evidence of a weak spiral structure , which have been seen as strong spiral shocks during an outburst observed by @xcite .",
    "our results also differ from those of @xcite , who also find that the bulk of the bright spot arising from the balmer , he  i and he  ii emission come from a region between the ballistic and keplerian trajectories .",
    "we interpret the difference between our results and previous studies simply by the fact that we have observed the system at a peculiar low state not detected before ( see sections  [ intro ] and [ discus ] ) .",
    "this should not be at all surprising because , although u  gem is a well observed object , it is also a very unusual and variable system .",
    "figure  [ fig : spottom ] shows a blow - up of the region around the secondary star .",
    "the bright spot is shown close to the center of mass of the late - type star , slightly located towards the leading hemisphere .",
    "since this is a velocity map and not a geometrical one , there are at two possible interpretations of the position in space of the bright spot ( assuming the observed material is in the orbital plane ) .",
    "the first one is that the emission is been produced at the surface of the secondary , i.e. still attached to its gravitational field .",
    "the second is that the emission is the result of a direct shock front with the accretion disc and that the compact spot is starting to gain velocity towards the keplerian trajectory .",
    "we believe that the second explanation is more plausible , as it is consistent with the well accepted mechanism to produce a bright spot . on the other hand , at this peculiar low state it is difficult to invoke an external source strong enough to produce a back - illuminated secondary and especially a bright and compact spot on its leading hemisphere .",
    "assuming that the radial velocity semi - amplitudes reflect accurately the motion of the binary components , then from our results  @xmath71 km  s@xmath3 ; @xmath72 km  s@xmath3  and adopting @xmath73 we obtain :    @xmath74    @xmath75    @xmath76    and    @xmath77    using the inclination angle derived by @xcite , @xmath78 , the system parameters become : @xmath6 ; @xmath79 ; and @xmath8 .      a first order estimate of the dimensions of the disc  the inner and outer radius  can be made from the observed balmer emission line .",
    "its peak - to peak velocity separation is related to the outer radius of the accreted material , while the wings of the line , coming from the high velocity regions of the disc , can give an estimate of the inner radius @xcite .",
    "the peak - to - peak velocity separation of the 31 individual spectra were measured ( see section  [ double - peaks ] ) , as well as the velocity of the blue and red wings of @xmath54 at ten percent level of the continuum level .",
    "> from these measurements we derive mean values of @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "these velocities can be related to the disc radii from numerical disc simulations , tidal limitations and analytical approximations ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "if we assume the material in the disc at radius @xmath82 is moving with keplerian rotational velocity @xmath83 , then the radius in units of the binary separation is given by @xcite :    @xmath84    the observed maximum intensity of the double - peak emission in keplerian discs occurs close to the velocity of its outer radius @xcite . from the observed @xmath38 and @xmath85 values we obtain an outer radius of @xmath86 and an inner radius of @xmath87 . if we take @xmath88 from the last section we obtain an inner radius of the disc @xmath89 equivalent to about 97000  km .",
    "this is about 25 times larger than the expected radius of the white dwarf ( see section  [ discus ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the distance from the center of the primary to the inner lagrangian point , @xmath90 , is    @xmath91    where @xmath92 ( @xcite ) . using @xmath93",
    "we obtain @xmath94 .",
    "the disc , therefore , appears to be large , almost filling the roche - lobe of the primary , with the matter leaving the secondary component through the @xmath11 point colliding with the disc directly and producing the hot spot near this location .",
    "for the first time , a radial velocity semi - amplitude of the primary component of u  gem has been obtained in the visual spectral region , which agrees with the value obtained from ultraviolet observations by @xcite and @xcite . in a recent paper , @xcite present high - resolution spectroscopy around h@xmath0 and h@xmath95 and conclude that they can not recover the ultraviolet value for @xmath49 to better than about 20 percent by any method .",
    "although the spectral resolution at h@xmath0 of the instrument they used is only a factor of two smaller than that of the one we used , the diagnostic diagrams they obtain show a completely different behavior as compared to those we present here , with best values for @xmath18 of about 95 km s@xmath3 from h@xmath0 and 150 km s@xmath3 from h@xmath95 ( see their figures 13 and 14 , respectively ) .",
    "we believe that the disagreement with our result lies not in the quality of the data or the measuring method , but in the distortion of the emission lines due to the presence of a complex accretion disc at the time of their observations , as the authors themselves suggest .",
    "their doppler tomograms show emission at low velocity , close to the center of mass , two distinct spots , a narrow component close to the @xmath11 point , and a broader and larger one between the keplerian and the ballistic trajectories .",
    "there is even evidence of a weak spiral structure .",
    "in contrast , we have observed u  gem during a favorable stage , one in which the disc was fully symmetric , and the hot - spot was narrow and near the inner lagrangian point .",
    "this allowed us to measure the real motion of the white dwarf by means of the time - resolved behavior of the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "our highly consistent results for the systemic velocity derived from the h@xmath0 spot ( @xmath66 10 km  s@xmath3 and those found from the different methods used for the radial velocity analysis of the emission arising from the accretion disk ( see section  [ prim ] and table  [ orbparam ] ) , give strong support to our adopting a true systemic velocity value of @xmath67 2 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "if we are indeed detecting the true motion of the white dwarf , we can use this adopted value , to make an independent check on the mass of the primary : the observed total redshift of the white dwarf ( gravitational plus systemic) found by @xcite  is 172  km  s@xmath3 , from which , after subtraction of the adopted systemic velocity , we derive a gravitational shift of the white dwarf of 138  km s@xmath3 . from the mass - radius relationship for white dwarfs",
    "@xcite , we obtain consistent results for @xmath96 and @xmath97 = 3900 km ( see figure 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "this mass is in excellent agreement with that obtained in this paper from the radial velocity analysis .",
    "> from our new method to determine the radial velocity curve of the secondary ( section  [ ugemb ] ) , we obtain a value for the semi - amplitude close to 310 km s@xmath3 .",
    "three previous papers have determinations of the radial velocity curves from the observed na  i doublet in the near - infrared . in order to evaluate",
    "if our method is valid , we here compare our result with these direct determinations .",
    "the published values are : @xmath98 km s@xmath99 ( @xcite )",
    "; @xmath100 km s@xmath101 , ( before correction for irradiation effects , @xcite ) ; and @xmath102 km s@xmath3 @xcite . @xcite notes that an elliptical orbital ( @xmath103 ) may better fit his data , as the velocity extremum near phase 0.25 appears somewhat sharper than that near phase 0.75 ( see his figure 3 ) . however , he also finds a very large systemic velocity , @xmath104 km s@xmath3 , much larger than the values found by @xcite ( @xmath105 km s@xmath3 ) and @xcite ( @xmath106 6 km s@xmath3 ) , both obtained from the emission lines . since the discrepancy with the results of these two authors was large , @xcite defers this discussion to further confirmation of his results .",
    "instead , and more important , this author discusses two scenarios that may significantly alter the real value of @xmath19 : the non - sphericity and the back - illumination of the secondary . in the latter effect , each particular absorption line may move further away from , or closer to the center of mass of the binary .",
    "he estimates the magnitude of this effect and concludes that the deviation of the photocenter would probably be much less than 0.1 radii .",
    "@xcite further discusses the circumstances that might cause the photocenter to deviate , and concludes that their observed value for the semi - amplitude should be corrected down by 3.5 percent , to yield @xmath107 km s@xmath108 .",
    "although they discuss the results by @xcite  which indicate that the relatively small heating effects in quiescent dwarf novae always lead to a decrease in the measured @xmath109 for the na  i lines ",
    "they argue that line quenching , produced by ionization of the same lines , may also be important , and result in an increased @xmath109 .",
    "another disturbing effect , considered by the same authors , is line contamination by the presence of weak disc features , like the paschen lines . in this respect",
    "we point out here that a poor correction for telluric lines will function as an anchor , reducing also the amplitude of the radial velocity measurements .",
    "@xcite also find an observed systemic velocity of @xmath110 6 km s@xmath3 and a small eccentricity of @xmath111 .",
    "@xcite also discuss the distortion effects on the na  i lines and , based on their fit residuals , argue in favor of a depletion of the doublet in the leading hemisphere of the secondary , around phases 0.4 and 0.6 , as removing flux from the blueward wing of the lines results in an apparent redshift , which would explain the observed residuals .",
    "however , they additionally find that fitting the data to an eccentric orbit , with @xmath112 , results in a significant decrease in the residuals caused by this depletion , and conclude that it may be unnecessary to further correct the radial velocity curve .",
    "we must point out that a depletion of the blueward wing of the na  i lines will results in a contraction of the observed radial velocity curves , as the measured velocities  especially around phases 0.25 and 0.75  will be pulled towards the systemic velocity .",
    "@xcite present their results derived from the na  i doublet and the ki / tio region ( around 7550 - 7750  ) , compared with several spectral standards , all giving values between 289 and 305 km s@xmath3 ( no errors are quoted ) . based on the radial velocity measurements for na  i , obtained by these authors in 2001 january ( 115 spectra ) , and using gj213 as template ( see their table 1 ) ,",
    "we have recalculated the circular orbital parameters through our nonlinear least - squares fit .",
    "we find @xmath113 km s@xmath114 , in close agreement with their published value .",
    "it would be advisable to establish a link between the observed gamma velocity of the secondary and the semi - amplitude @xmath1 , under the assumption that its value may be distorted by heating effects .",
    "we take as a reference our results from the radial velocity analysis of the broad @xmath54 line and the hot - spot from the secondary , which support a true systemic velocity of 34 km s@xmath3 . however , we find no positive correlation in the available results derived from the na  i lines , either between different authors or even among one data set . in the case of @xcite ,",
    "the gamma values show a range between 11 and 43 km s@xmath3 , depending on the standard star used as a template , for @xmath1 velocities in the range 289 to 305 km s@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite finds @xmath115 10 km s@xmath3 for a low @xmath116 value of 283 km s@xmath3 , while @xcite finds @xmath117 6 km s@xmath3 for @xmath1 about 309 km s@xmath3 , and we obtain a large gamma velocity of about 69 km s@xmath3 for a @xmath1 value of 310 km s@xmath3 .",
    "we believe that further and more specific spectroscopic observations of the secondary star should be conducted in order to understand the possible distortion effects on lines like the na  i doublet , and their implications on the derived semi - amplitude and systemic velocity values .",
