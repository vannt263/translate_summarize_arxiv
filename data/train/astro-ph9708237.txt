    "a central issue of modern cosmology is the determination of the geometry of the universe , or , equivalently of its density parameter @xmath7 and of the cosmological constant @xmath2 . in recent years ,",
    "several lines of argument indicate that @xmath7 may be smaller than 1 , and , therefore , the universe may be open and have negative curvature . on the other hand , if the inflationary scenario applies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , then the universe should have flat geometry , i.e. , either the matter density has the critical value ( @xmath8 ) , or , if @xmath9 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 . in the latter case ,",
    "a non - zero cosmological constant is needed which may have interesting consequences for the cosmological deceleration parameter @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath13 may be negative .",
    "most methods to determine the deceleration parameter @xmath13 directly rely on the variation of the _ apparent _ sizes or brightnesses of standard objects with redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "so far , all measurements were inconclusive , because all objects which were bright or large enough to be potential standard rods or candles ( e.g. galaxies or clusters of galaxies ) , show significant evolution with redshift .",
    "in fact , until now most attempts to measure @xmath13 were better tests for galaxy and cluster evolution than for the cosmological model .",
    "only recently , supernovae ia , which may be true standard candles , have raised hopes for tighter constraints on @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the ongoing snia programs promise indeed to provide significant constraints on @xmath13 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , once enough snia will have been found at intermediate redshifts and all observational caveats will have been understood .    in this paper we want to explore whether luminous cluster ellipticals can be calibrated as cosmological standard rods . though it is almost certain that luminous elliptical galaxies have experienced a complex formation history ( with events ranging from accretion of satellite galaxies to violent similar ",
    "mass mergers , see e.g. @xcite ) , most of these events took place early in their evolution .",
    "this follows both from the homogenous properties of local cluster ellipticals ( @xcite ) and from the very small redshift evolution of luminosities ( @xcite ) , colors ( @xcite ) , and spectral indices ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the redshift evolution of the fundamental plane relation of ellipticals ( @xcite ) has also been found to be consistent with passive evolution of the stellar populations in ellipticals ( @xcite ) .",
    "basically passive evolution of cluster ellipticals is even expected in the most rapidly evolving standard cold dark matter model , where neither significant star formation nor accretion processes take place at @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation activity observed in distant clusters of galaxies seems to be confined to blue infalling and/or harrassed disk galaxies ( @xcite ) which may turn into intermediate luminosity s0s today but are unlikely to alter the population of massive cluster ellipticals at a significant level .    because massive cluster ellipticals evolve only passively up to redshifts @xmath15 , one can attempt to calibrate them as cosmological standard rods .",
    "the method proposed here is based on the fundamental plane relation of elliptical galaxies , which allows us to derive accurate radii from their velocity dispersions and surface brightnesses , combined with a correction for luminosity evolution obtained from the mg@xmath0 test ( @xcite ) .",
    "we give a first application of this method by deriving constraints on @xmath13 from nine ellipticals in two clusters at @xmath1 . in ",
    "2 we present the method , in  3 we discuss possible caveats . in  4 observations and data analysis are described , the results of which are presented in  5 .",
    "conclusions are drawn in  6 .",
    "the fp describes the observed tight scaling relation between effective radius ( @xmath16 ) , mean effective surface brightness ( @xmath17sb@xmath18 ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath19 ) of cluster ellipticals : @xmath20 with @xmath16 in kpc , @xmath19 in km / s , @xmath17sb@xmath18 in the b - band .",
    "the constant -8.895 was derived from the coma cluster ellipticals with a hubble constant of h@xmath21km / s / mpc , the error in the constant is about 0.01 ( see below ) .",
    "the fp allows to predict the effective radii @xmath16 of elliptical galaxies with better than 15% accuracy from their velocity dispersions and surface brightnesses , i.e. , a distance dependent quantity ( @xmath16 ) can be estimated from two distance independent quantities ( @xmath19 , @xmath17sb@xmath18 ) .",
    "if a large enough number of ellipticals are measured per cluster , then the distance to the corresponding cluster can be determined with significantly better than 5% accuracy because otherwise the observed peculiar velocities of clusters would be much larger ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "as argued in the introduction , we have strong evidence that massive ellipticals in rich clusters evolve only passively between now and at least @xmath22 .",
    "passive evolution of the stellar population can be accurately measured with the mg@xmath0 relation which is independent from @xmath13 and h@xmath23 ( @xcite ) , and is within current limits the same for clusters of similar richness / velocity dispersion ( @xcite , see also below ) . in local cluster ellipticals ,",
    "the mg@xmath24 absorption is tightly coupled to the velocity dispersion @xmath19 of the galaxy constraining the scatter in age and metallicity at a given @xmath19 to be smaller than 15% .",
    "therefore , in the case of passive evolution , mg@xmath24 decreases with redshift only because the age of the population decreases .",
    "one can use population synthesis models to translate the observed @xmath25 weakening into an estimate of the b  band luminosity evolution .",
    "based on models by @xcite , and @xcite , we obtain consistently @xmath26mg@xmath24 for a salpeter initial mass function , metallicities between 1/3 and 3 times solar and ages between 3  gyr and 15  gyr ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the slope of 1.4 shows no dependence ( within 0.1 ) on evolutionary tracks and other differences in the synthesis models , which demonstrates that this differential comparison of mg@xmath24 and b - band evolution is quite robust ( see also  3 ) .",
    "obviously , there is a number of caveats that have to be addressed at this point .",
    "most of them need further checking before ellipticals can reliably serve as standard rods .",
    "however , the influence of all these effects is rather small and there is justified hope that they may be controlled better in the future .",
    "\\(1 ) dynamical evolution .",
    "we now have very good evidence that dynamical evolution will not alter the fp at a detectable level .",
    "there are two simple observational arguments .",
    "first , different types of objects , like anisotropic ellipticals , rotationally flattened ellipticals and s0 galaxies show no significant offsets from the mean fp relation .",
    "this means that objects of very different internal structure and dynamics and very different formation / evolution histories are indistinguishable in the edge  on view of the fp , implying that changes in the dynamical structure transforming objects from one type to an other will not affect the fp relation .",
    "second , the successful use of the fp to derive peculiar motions from clusters and groups of galaxies of different richness and internal evolution ( @xcite ) indicates that environment and interaction can alter the fundamental plane parameters on the few percent level at most .",
    "finally , recent numerical simulations show that dissipationless merging of objects within the fp produces objects that are again in the plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "\\(2 ) dependence on environment , i.e. , systematic differences between the fundamental plane and mg@xmath0 relations of different clusters . at present",
    ", the small observed peculiar velocities of clusters ( e.g. @xcite ) imply that the systematic variation of the fp zeropoint from cluster to cluster must be significantly smaller than 5% .",
    "for the mg@xmath0 relation a weak dependence on cluster velocity dispersion or richness has been observed ( @xcite , but see colless et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . in any case , there is no evidence that , at a given richness , the zeropoint of the mg@xmath27 relation varies by more than 0.08 .",
    "furthermore , the effects of different zeropoints can be minimized by observing a large enough sample of ellipticals in different clusters .",
    "\\(3 ) sample selection effects .",
    "we estimated the combined biasing effect of the sample size , sample selection and allowed range of the fp parameters by means of monte carlo simulations following @xcite .",
    "we find that the systematic bias of the fp zero - point is smaller than the random variation estimated in table 1 , for the range of fp coefficients given by jrgensen et al .",
    "a large complete sample of distant cluster ellipticals can minimize selection effects .",
    "\\(4 ) dust absorption .",
    "dust absorption can be estimated by comparing colors and line - strength indices .",
    "we could rule out a significant presence of dust in the @xmath1 ellipticals by checking the relation between their rest ",
    "frame b@xmath28v color and their mg@xmath24 values , finding that it is consistent with the local ( b@xmath28v)mg@xmath24 relation ( e.g. , @xcite ) and population synthesis models ( @xcite ) .",
    "\\(5 ) population synthesis models . at present , population synthesis models ( e.g. , @xcite ) do not always give a consistent interpretation of ages and metallicities of stellar populations .",
    "close inspection shows that the differences mostly arise because of different zeropoints in the modeled magnitudes , colors and line - strengths for a given age - metallicity combination",
    ". however , the different models agree very well with respect to _ differential _ relations .",
    "e.g. , dmg@xmath24/db as a function of age is virtually the same for all models , despite of different stellar evolution tracks and numerical codes ( see figure  1 ) . at present ,",
    "the biggest uncertainty with respect to the method discussed here stems from the fact that all synthesis codes rely on the same set of fitting - functions for the line - indices , introduced by @xcite and revised by @xcite .",
    "these reproduce the mg - indices of g- and k - stars as a function of temperature , gravity and metallicity in an excellent manner , but only for stars with solar abundance ratios while massive ellipticals are overabundant in mg relative to fe .",
    "it is plausible that the _ differential _ temperature dependence of the mg@xmath24 index is not very sensitive to this effect but further checking is needed .",
    "\\(6 ) initial mass function .",
    "the relation between time evolution in the b - band and mg@xmath24 is dependent on the exponent @xmath29 of the initial mass function . from models of @xcite",
    "we find : @xmath30 , where the subscript @xmath31 indicates the salpeter exponent ( @xmath32 ) . at present",
    ", there is neither evidence nor a convincing physical argument for an imf slope much different from salpeter s for the metallicities around solar and for the mass range concerned ( between 0.8@xmath33 and 1.2@xmath33 ) .",
    "still , this is a key assumption for the method to work .",
    "\\(7 ) effects of mixed populations .",
    "we performed tests with varying fractions of intermediate age populations superposed on an old population , all constrained in a way that the objects at @xmath1 would _ not _ be regarded as of @xmath34 type from spectral characteristics ( @xcite ) . for plausible population mixes , the uncertainty in the evolution correction is smaller than 0.1  mag in the b  band .",
    "figure  1 shows two examples for the mg@xmath24 vs. b - band evolution of mixed populations .",
    "one experienced a 10% starburst 3  gyrs , the other 1.5  gyrs before the redshift of observation ( @xmath35 ) . in the second case",
    "a significant curvature is present in the mg@xmath24-b - relation .",
    "this indicates that evolution effects due to mixed populations with @xmath36  mag are more difficult to correct reliably .",
    "however , note that in case of massive ellipticals it is very difficult to add 10% of young stars over a short period because the gas content of most objects that can be accreted is too small relative to the total mass of the elliptical .",
    "we analysed a sample of nine elliptical galaxies in the clusters abell  370 and ms  1512 + 36 at @xmath1 .",
    "abell  370 is of similar richness as the coma cluster , which serves as our local calibrator , ms  1512 + 36 is less rich .",
    "spectroscopic data were obtained at the calar alto 3.5 m telescope and the ntt at eso .",
    "details of the spectroscopic observations and data analysis can be found in ziegler & bender ( 1997 ) .",
    "the largest uncertainty in the obtained velocity dispersions and mg@xmath24-indices comes from the applied aperture corrections necessary to compare local and distant ellipticals .",
    "however , the errors from aperture corrections can be expected to become smaller in the near future because better data for nearby ellipticals will allow to integrate over apertures large enough for direct comparison with distant ellipticals , and spatial resolution will also improve for distant ellipticals due to the use of large telescopes .",
    "the spectroscopic parameters for the local comparison sample were taken from @xcite . at present",
    ", there still exists some uncertainty in the parameters of the low - redshift mg@xmath27 relation ( @xcite , see figure  2 ) because the mg@xmath37 values for coma and virgo ellipticals have to be tansformed to mg@xmath24 values .",
    "however , this uncertainty is not crucial at the present stage of analysis and will be reduced by future measurements .",
    "we used the relation mg@xmath38mg@xmath37 , see ziegler & bender ( 1997 ) .",
    "accurate radii and surface brightnesses for the distant ellipticals were obtained with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the refurbished wide field and planetary camera ( wfpcii ) . the structural parameters @xmath16 and @xmath39 in the f675w filter",
    "were derived using the two  component fitting algorithm developed by @xcite , with hst psf convolution tables .",
    "ground  based imaging at the eso ntt and the calar alto 2.2 m telescope in several colors ( ziegler , in preparation ) complemented the hst imaging and allowed an accurate transformation to rest ",
    "frame colors using models of @xcite .",
    "surface brightnesses were transformed to rest  frame b  band , corrected for cosmological dimming ( @xmath40 ) and for passive evolution using the @xmath41 relation described above .",
    "galactic extinction was corrected using extinctions of @xcite , kindly provided by david burstein .",
    "the photometric parameters of the local comparison sample of coma galaxies ( @xcite ) were re  derived with the same procedure as used for the @xmath1 objects .",
    "the b  band photometric zeropoints were improved using aperture photometry from @xcite and @xcite reducing the rms scatter about the coma fp to about 10% in the effective radius ( see figure  3 ) .",
    "we applied k  corrections and corrections for galactic extinction as in @xcite plus the correction for the cosmological dimming of surface brightness .",
    "since the @xmath1 ellipticals are about a factor of 10 more distant than the coma galaxies , the factor 10 better sampling and smaller psf of hst relative to the ground  based imaging of coma corresponds to a perfectly matched instrumental set  up .",
    "* error analysis . *",
    "an account of the major sources of error is given in table 1 .",
    "the dominant error is due to the correction for luminosity evolution .",
    "this error is partly random and partly systematic .",
    "for the rather few objects we consider here , the random error is still dominating .",
    "note that because of error coupling in the kormendy relation @xmath42 ( @xmath43 surface brightness in linear flux units ) , the error in @xmath44 is much smaller than in each of @xmath16 and @xmath45 separately ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the scatter of the @xmath1 ellipticals around the fp is somewhat smaller ( only 15% ) than we expect from the error estimate ( @xmath46% ) suggests that our error estimate is conservative .",
    "the photometric and spectroscopic parameters for the elliptical galaxies in the clusters abell  370 and ms  1512 + 36 at @xmath1 are given in table 2 .",
    "figure  2 shows the mg@xmath27 relation for the local comparison sample of coma and virgo ellipticals and the nine ellipticals observed in abell  370 and ms1512 + 36 at @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath1 objects show a mg@xmath24 weakening of about 0.345  which is typical for ellipticals at this redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  3 shows the edge  on view of the fundamental plane for coma ellipticals with @xmath47km / s and for the @xmath1 ellipticals .",
    "the angular distances at which a perfect match between the two samples is achieved are 139  mpc / h@xmath48 for coma and 1400  mpc / h@xmath48 for the @xmath1 ellipticals ( h@xmath48 is the hubble constant in units of 50km / s / mpc ) , see below .",
    "the @xmath1 objects are shown three times in figure  3 , first as observed in the rest - frame b - band , then with a correction applied for cosmological @xmath40 dimming , and finally corrected for luminosity evolution .",
    "the luminosity correction is calculated based on the _ mean _ offset in the mg@xmath24 absorption of the local and the @xmath1 sample , i.e. , @xmath49mag / arcsec@xmath50 .",
    "we could also have corrected the luminosity evolution of the objects individually and would have obtained the same result .",
    "in fact , the residuals of the distant ellipticals from the fundamental plane and from the mg@xmath27 relation correlate with each other in the expected way , though the error bars are large ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "this supports the idea that the evolution we see is really due to age . while for local samples of ellipticals we can not conclude reliably that the residuals from the fp and mg@xmath27 relations are correlated and caused by age ( see @xcite ) , the effects of age spread must increase with redshift and may lead to the correlation observed in figure  4 .",
    "the cosmological model is constrained on the basis of figure  3 as follows .",
    "the distance ratio at which the fully corrected fp of the @xmath1 clusters matches the fp of coma is @xmath51 . with an angular distance of 139  mpc / h@xmath48 for coma ( corrected to the cosmic microwave background rest ",
    "frame following @xcite ) this ratio corresponds to an angular distance of 1400  mpc / h@xmath48 for abell  370 and ms1512 + 36 at @xmath1 which is the distance adopted in figure  3 ( h@xmath48 is the hubble constant in units of 50  km / s / mpc ) . for a plausible range of cosmological models , the distance to the coma cluster",
    "is , because of its proximity , virtually independent from @xmath13 ( at the level of 0.5% ) , while the distance to the @xmath1 clusters varies by more than 10% .",
    "since the geometry of the universe is determined by the ratio of distances , @xmath13 is independent from the hubble constant .",
    "the relative error of mean distance to the @xmath1 clusters is about 8% ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the mean distance to @xmath1 and its error give immediate constraints on the cosmological model , see figure  5 .",
    "if the cosmological constant vanishes then our measurements , together with the observational fact that there exists matter in the universe , constrain the cosmological density parameter to be @xmath52 , or the cosmological deceleration parameter to be @xmath53 , with 90% confidence .",
    "if the universe has flat geometry as suggested by inflation , then the preferred model would have @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath6 is constrained to fall in the range @xmath55 , again with 90% confidence .",
    "we have explored the possibility to calibrate elliptical galaxies as cosmological standard rods .",
    "the proposed method is based on the fundamental plane relation of elliptical galaxies and the mg@xmath27 test which allows us to calibrate the luminosity evolution of their stellar populations .",
    "the main assumptions that have to be made for this procedure to work are : ( 1 ) the fundamental plane and mg@xmath0 relations are the same for clusters of similar richness and ( 2 ) the slope of the initial mass function of low mass stars is known and has the same value in different objects and environments ( here we adopt the salpeter value ) .",
    "further critical issues that need future checking are the reliability of stellar population models and the influence of sample selection effects and mixed populations .    a first application of the method has been given .",
    "we have shown that , under the provisos given above , it is possible to derive interesting constraints on the matter density and the cosmological constant using elliptical galaxies . in the future ,",
    "stronger constraints should be possible if large samples of ellipticals up to redshift of close to 1 ( @xcite ) are analysed in a similar way , and if the caveats and systematic effects discussed above can be controlled efficiently .",
