    "frustrated ( zigzag ) spin-@xmath14 chains with competing nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic ( @xmath10 ) and next - nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic ( @xmath11 ) couplings reveal rich physics at low temperatures and in applied magnetic fields .",
    "when the chains are coupled in three dimensions , helical order arises in zero field for while the helical order itself gives rise to a very unusual phenomenon of magnetic - field - induced ferroelectricity  @xcite , further interesting effects occur when stronger magnetic fields break this order down .",

    "the field evolution of @xmath5 is , at first glance , reminiscent of a conventional long - range afm ordering and reveals no appreciable anisotropy . finally , the high - field phase emerging above 18 t turns out to be weakly dependent on the field direction and thus nearly isotropic .",
    "the emergence of the high - field phase for different field directions indicates its relation to the physics of the isotropic @xmath8 spin chain .",
    "this phase can be ascribed to the multipolar order or nematic state envisaged in recent theoretical studies  @xcite .",

    "while the incommensurability along the @xmath4-direction is a natural result of the intrachain frustration , the incommensurability along @xmath2 can be understood as a competition of ferromagnetic interchain couplings with the helical ( or spin - density - wave ) order within the chain .    regarding magnetic anisotropy",

    "<S> isotropic and anisotropic magnetic behavior of the frustrated spin chain compound @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 is reported . </S>",
    "<S> three magnetic transitions observed in zero magnetic field are tracked in fields applied along different crystallographic directions using magnetization , heat capacity , and magnetostriction measurements . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively different temperature - field diagrams are obtained below 10 t for the field applied along @xmath2 or @xmath3 and along @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a nearly isotropic high - field phase emerges above 18 t and persists up to the saturation that occurs around 22.5 t . upon cooling in low fields , </S>",
    "<S> the transitions at @xmath5 and @xmath6 toward the spin - density - wave and stripe phases are of the second order , whereas the transition at @xmath7 toward the helical state is of the first order and entails a lattice component . </S>",
    "<S> our microscopic analysis identifies frustrated @xmath8 spin chains with a sizable antiferromagnetic interchain coupling in the @xmath9 plane and ferromagnetic couplings along the @xmath2 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between these ferromagnetic interchain couplings and the helical order within the chain underlies the incommensurate order along the @xmath2-direction , as observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> while a helical state is triggered by the competition between @xmath10 and @xmath11 within the chain , the plane of the helix is not uniquely defined because of competing magnetic anisotropies . using high - resolution synchrotron diffraction and @xmath12te nuclear magnetic resonance </S>",
    "<S> , we also demonstrate that the crystal structure of @xmath0-tevo@xmath1 does not change down to 10k , and the orbital state of v@xmath13 is preserved . </S>"
