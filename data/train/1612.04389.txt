    "perturbation theory is a powerful tool to obtain reliable predictions for physical observables within the standard model of particle physics or its extensions . due to the high precision of experimental results , e.g. , at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) or at the @xmath2 factories , it is on the one hand mandatory to advance the development of tools , which can be used for higher order calculations . on the other hand",
    "it is necessary to improve the understanding of the perturbative structure of quantum field theories .",
    "form factors are ideal objects to obtain deeper insight into the latter . especially in the context of qcd",
    "they are indispensable tools to investigate the infrared structure of scattering amplitudes to high orders in perturbation theory . moreover , from the pole part it is possible to extract universal process - independent quantities  @xcite like the cusp anomalous dimension which can be extracted from the @xmath3 pole of the form factor .",
    "the finite parts of the form factors serve as building blocks for a variety of physical processes .",
    "for example , the quark - anti - quark - photon form factor enters the virtual corrections of the drell - yan process for the production of lepton pairs at hadron colliders .    in this paper",
    "we consider the quark - anti - quark - photon form factor which is conveniently obtained from the photon - quark vertex function @xmath4 by applying an appropriate projector . in @xmath5 space - time dimensions we have @xmath6 with @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the incoming quark and anti - quark momenta and @xmath10 is the momentum of the photon .",
    "we perform our calculation in the framework of qcd keeping the number of colours , @xmath1 , generic . in the limit of large @xmath1 the calculation of @xmath0",
    "is simplified since only planar feynman diagrams contribute .",
    "this is the limit we consider in this paper . besides @xmath1 we also keep the number of active quark flavours , @xmath11 as a parameter and thus have at four - loop order the colour structures @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 where each factor of @xmath11 counts the number of closed fermion loops .",
    "two- and three - loop corrections to @xmath0 have been computed in refs .",
    "@xcite . to obtain the four - loop corrections two obstacles need",
    "to be overcome : ( i ) the reduction to a set of basis integrals and ( ii ) the ( if possible ) analytic calculation of the latter .",
    "recently , the first steps towards four loops have been initiated by computing the fermionic contributions to @xmath0 in the planar limit  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 terms have been confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite using different methods both for the reduction and the computation of the master integrals .",

    "the feynman amplitudes are generated with qgraf  @xcite .",
    "since there is no possibility to select already at this point the planar diagrams also non - planar amplitudes are generated and we obtain in total 1 , 15 , 337 and 9784 diagrams at one , two , three and four loops .",
    "sample feynman diagrams at four loops can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig::diags ] .",
    "next , we transform the output to form  @xcite notation using q2e and exp  @xcite .",
    "the program exp furthermore maps each feynman diagram to predefined integral families for massless four - loop vertices with two different non - vanishing external momenta ; 68 of them are of planar type . at this point",
    "we perform the dirac algebra and decompose the numerator into terms which appear in the denominator .",
    "this allows us to express each feynman integral as a linear combination of scalar functions which belong to the corresponding family . after exploiting the symmetries connected to the exchange of the external momenta we can reduce the number of families , for which integral tables have to be generated , from 68 to 38 .",
    "note that for the fermionic contributions , which have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , only 24 families are needed .",
    "for the reduction to master integrals we use the program fire  @xcite which we apply in combination with litered  @xcite .",
    "we observe that the non - fermionic diagrams lead to more complex integrals for which the reduction time significantly increases .",

    "it has been suggested to turn from the basis of primary master integrals to a so - called canonical basis where the corresponding integrals satisfy a system differential equations which has a particular structure : the dependence on @xmath27 appears as a linear prefactor and the matrix in front of the vector of master integrals has only simple poles in @xmath26 , i.e. has only so - called fuchsian singularities .",
    "such a system can then easily be solved in terms of iterated integrals .    in ref .",
