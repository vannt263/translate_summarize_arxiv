    "<S> recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation by the boomerang and maxima experiments indicate that the universe is spatially flat . here </S>",
    "<S> some simple back - of - the - envelope calculations are used to explain the result . </S>",
    "<S> the main result is a simple formula for the angular scale of the acoustic peak in terms of the standard cosmological parameters : @xmath0 $ ] .    # </S>",
    "<S> 1to 0pt#1    as we enter the era of precision cosmology , it gets increasingly difficult to understand how cosmological parameters are extracted from observational data . </S>",
    "<S> the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) is a prime example . </S>",
    "<S> anisotropies in the cmbr are influenced by a large number of cosmological parameters , including , but not limited to ; the hubble constant ; the spatial curvature ; the spatial topology ; the vacuum energy density ; the baryon density ; the number of light neutrinos ; and the amplitude and spectral index of the primordial density perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> using accurate maps of the cmbr , it should be possible to fix all of these parameters with great precision@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , with so many parameters and so many physical effects to keep track of , it is hard to explain how a particular parameter is extracted from the data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the aim here is to provide a simple explanation of how the microwave background radiation can be used to measure the spatial curvature . </S>",
    "<S> the test was first proposed by by doroshkevich , zeldovich and sunyaev@xcite , and has subsequently been developed by many authors . </S>",
    "<S> the most comprehensive treatment can be found in the work of hu and white@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the curvature measurement is based on simple geometry . </S>",
    "<S> if you know the physical size of an object and how far away it is , then by measuring its angular size you can infer the curvature of space . </S>",
    "<S> suppose that the object has size @xmath1 and is a distance @xmath2 away . </S>",
    "<S> in flat space the angle subtended by the object is given by @xmath3 however , if the space is negatively curved with radius of curvature @xmath4 , the angle will be given by @xmath5 notice that ( [ hyper ] ) recovers that flat space result ( [ flat ] ) in the limit @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for a positively curved space can be obtained by replacing @xmath4 by @xmath7 in ( [ hyper ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> to apply the angular size test we need to know the size of a distant object and how far away it is . </S>",
    "<S> when the test is applied to the microwave background radiation , the role of the distant `` ruler stick '' is played by the size of the sound horizon at last scatter , and the distance to the object is the radius of the last scattering surface . </S>",
    "<S> both of these quantities depend on several cosmological parameters , but the spatial curvature turns out to be the dominant effect .    </S>",
    "<S> we can measure the angular size subtended by the sound horizon by looking for a special feature in the cmbr angular power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the angular power spectrum is obtained by `` fourier '' analyzing the cmbr anisotropy pattern . </S>",
    "<S> sound waves in the photon - baryon fluid with wavelengths roughly twice the size of the sound horizon at last scatter will have just reached a maximum density contrast when matter and radiation decouple . </S>",
    "<S> as we shall see , these waves have periods that are long compared to the time taken for matter and radiation to decouple . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the compression  </S>",
    "<S> rarefaction pattern is snap frozen at decoupling . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced density contrast that occurs on the scale of the sound horizon leads to an enhanced temperature anisotropy , as the cmbr photons are redshifted by an amount proportional to the local density . by measuring the scale at which the peak in the angular power spectrum occurs </S>",
    "<S> , we are able to establish the angular size of the sound horizon . </S>",
    "<S> note : the acoustic peaks are _ density _ peaks , not `` doppler peaks '' . </S>",
    "<S> the fluid is at a turn - around point when maximum density contrast is reached , so the velocity of the baryons , and hence the doppler shift , is at a minimum .    before proceeding to show how the angle subtended by the sound horizon </S>",
    "<S> is related to the spatial curvature , a little more non - euclidean geometry is in order . consider a geodesic triangle drawn in hyperbolic space . </S>",
    "<S> the law of cosines reads @xmath8 here @xmath9 are the side lengths and @xmath10 are the opposite angles . </S>",
    "<S> now suppose that @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . using the law of cosines we have @xmath14 and @xmath15 the sum of the angles in the triangle </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath16 thus , the angle sum is less that @xmath17 if space is negatively curved , greater than @xmath17 if space is positively curved , and equal to @xmath17 if space is flat . in our cosmological </S>",
    "<S> setting , @xmath1 is the size of the sound horizon , @xmath2 is the radius of the last scattering surface and @xmath18 is the angular scale corresponding to the first acoustic peak . </S>",
    "<S> space is flat if the angle sum in our cosmic triangle adds to @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> turning now from the spatial geometry to the spacetime geometry , the unperturbed background geometry is described by the friedman - robertson - walker line element @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the scale factor in units where @xmath21 today , and @xmath22 is the spatial curvature radius today . </S>",
    "<S> the time - time component of einstein s field equations reads ( in units where @xmath23 ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy density and a dot denotes @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> solving for @xmath4 we find @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the hubble constant and @xmath29 is the total energy density today in units of the critical density @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> space is negatively curved if @xmath31 , positively curved if @xmath32 and flat if @xmath33 . using conservation of energy - momentum , the friedman equation ( [ fried ] ) </S>",
    "<S> can be rewritten in the useful form @xmath34 here @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote the contributions to the total energy density from radiation ( photons and light neutrinos ) , non - relativistic matter ( baryons and cold dark matter ) , and an unclustered dark matter component with equation of state @xmath38 where @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the unclustered dark matter takes the form of a cosmological constant when @xmath40 .    </S>",
    "<S> since angles are conformally invariant , we can use the conformally related static metric @xmath41 the static ( or optical ) metric has the nice property that null geodesics in spacetime correspond to ordinary geodesics in space . </S>",
    "<S> the conformal time @xmath42 is related to the cosmological time @xmath43 by @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> our task now is to calculate the size of the sound horizon at last scatter , and the radius of the last scattering surface . to leading order , </S>",
    "<S> the sound speed in the photon - baryon fluid is equal to @xmath45 , so the sound horizon is roughly @xmath46 times smaller than the conformal time interval between last scatter and the big bang ( or between last scatter and reheating if we are considering inflationary models ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the size of the sound horizon is given by @xmath47 the size of the universe at last scatter , @xmath48 , is inversely proportional to the redshift of last scatter , @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of the surface of last scatter is equal to the conformal time interval between last scatter and today : @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> using the same approximations used to derive equation ( [ alp ] ) , we can relate the angle subtended by the sound horizon , @xmath51 , to @xmath52 and @xmath53 : @xmath54    let us begin with a simple case . </S>",
    "<S> consider a matter dominated universe with @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrals ( [ sh ] ) and ( [ sls ] ) yield @xmath56 and the angular size of the sound horizon is given by @xmath57 the angle sum in the cosmic triangle is given by @xmath58 note that while both @xmath52 and @xmath53 depend on @xmath59 and @xmath60 , the angles only depend on @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in a matter dominated universe , the position of the first acoustic peak is an excellent measure of the curvature . since the cmbr experiments report their results in terms of angular power spectra , it is conventional to convert the angular scale into its fourier equivalent , the multipole number @xmath61 . for a matter dominated universe , the first acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum </S>",
    "<S> is located at @xmath62 .    for more realistic cosmological models , with both radiation and multi - component dark matter , </S>",
    "<S> the integrals ( [ sh ] ) and ( [ sls ] ) can not be evaluated in terms of simple functions . </S>",
    "<S> approximate forms can be found as a power series expansions in the quantities @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is a measure of the curvature and @xmath67 denotes the redshift of matter - radiation equality . to leading order </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath68 the expression for the radius of the last scattering surface , @xmath53 , is good to within @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 - see the appendix for details . the quantity @xmath65 that appears in ( [ fo ] ) is well approximated by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath74 mpc@xmath74 . in order to find a simple expansion for @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> , we can choose either @xmath73 or @xmath75 as a free parameter and expand the quantity @xmath76 as @xmath77 or @xmath78 the first version works best when @xmath36 and @xmath73 are close to the currently favored values of @xmath79 and @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the second version works best if @xmath81 and @xmath82 . putting everything together in ( [ main ] ) we find @xmath83 or , </S>",
    "<S> specializing to the case @xmath40 and @xmath81 , we find @xmath84 the above expressions for @xmath51 give a good qualitative picture of how the various cosmological parameters affect the location of the first acoustic peak . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the peak position is mainly determined by the curvature , and only weakly dependent on the value of the hubble constant . </S>",
    "<S> the peak position is largely insensitive to the value of the cosmological constant .    the angle subtended by the sound horizon is smaller in a negatively curved universe and larger in a positively curved universe . </S>",
    "<S> the angles in the triangle formed by the sound horizon and the earth sum to @xmath85 neglecting photon self - gravity , sound waves in the photon - baryon fluid obey a simple harmonic oscillator equation , and the position of the first acoustic peak corresponds to the angular size of the sound horizon @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> however , when photon self - gravity is included , the oscillator equation gains an anharmonic term that shifts the position of the first few peaks . taking this into account , and using standard isentropic initial conditions , and neglecting silk damping , the temperature fluctuations vary as a function of scale as  @xcite @xmath87 solving for the position of the first peak , we find @xmath88 so that for @xmath89 @xmath90 the recent mat @xmath91@xcite , boomerang @xmath91@xcite and maxima@xmath91@xcite results locate the first acoustic peak at @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively . using the boomerang results , and allowing @xmath73 and @xmath95 to vary freely over the range @xmath96 and @xmath97 , our approximate formula ( [ fnl ] ) yields a best fit value of @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> this result is consistent with the universe being spatially flat , and agrees with the detailed analysis@xcite of the boomerang data . since the curvature is the dominant effect in fixing the location of the acoustic peak , we are able to get a good fix on @xmath60 despite having only one equation for three unknowns @xmath99 . in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , simple analytic formulas can be found that give good qualitative , and decent quantitative , insight into how the cmbr observations are used to fix the spatial curvature . </S>"
