    "computer chess has been an active area of research since shannon s @xcite seminal paper , where he suggested the basic minimax search strategies and heuristics , which have been refined and improved over the years .",
    "the many advances since then in improving the search engine algorithms , the static evaluation of chess positions , the representation and learning of chess knowledge , the use of large opening and endgame databases , and the exploitation of computer hardware including parallel processing and special - purpose hardware , have resulted in the development of powerful computer - chess programs , some of which are of top - grandmaster - level strength @xcite .    the ultimate test for a chess - playing program is to play a match against the world champion or one of the leading grandmasters . in may 1997 an historic match was played between between ibm s deep blue chess computer and garry kasparov , then world champion , resulting in a spectacular win for the machine , 3.5  2.5 .",
    "( see www.chess.ibm.com for the archived web site of this historic match . ) despite the computer winning the match there has been an ongoing debate since then on whether the highest ranking computer - chess programs are at the world - championship level , through most seem to agree that it is inevitable that eventually chess machines will dominate",
    ". using special - purpose hardware and parallelization deep blue @xcite was capable of analysing up to 200 million positions per second , while the only other chess program to - date , known to run at a comparable speed , is hydra @xcite . the hydra team , consider their program to be successor of deep blue and their goal is to create the strongest chess - playing computer , which can convincingly defeat the human world chess champion .",
    "a recent six game match played in june 2005 between hydra and leading british grandmaster michael adams resulted in a convincing win for the machine , 5.5  0.5 .",
    "( see http://tournament.hydrachess.com for the web site archiving the match . )",
    "there have been other recent man - machine chess matches against top performing multiprocessor chess engines capable of analysing several million positions per second , with the results against world champions still being inconclusive @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether the era of chess man - machine contests is nearing its end , nonetheless , with machines having ever growing computing resources the future looks bleak for any human contestants in such matches .",
    "here we concentrate on the late opening / early middle - game phase of the game , and , in particular the research question we address is whether the opening books used by modern chess engines in machine versus machine competitions are `` comparable '' to those used by chess players in human versus human competitions .    for humans , opening preparation is known to be very important , as can be seen , for example , by the large proportion of chess books concentrating on the opening phase of the game .",
    "modern chess players also use software packages , such as those developed by chessbase ( www.chessbase.com ) or chess assistant ( www.chessassistant.com ) , to assist them in their opening preparation for matches .",
    "these packages typically make use of large databases of opening positions , referred to as _ opening books _ , whose positions can be searched and are linked to recent databases of games ( some of which may be annotated by experts ) .",
    "this combined with the use of state - of - the - art chess engines for position analysis , provides players with extremely powerful tools for opening study and preparation .",
    "it is often recommended that chess students combine the study of openings with typical middle game motifs and endgame structures which may arise from the openings in question , and computer chess software can be very useful for this purpose @xcite .",
    "opening theory has become so developed that it is common between expert chess players to play the first 15 moves or so from memory ; see , for example the encyclopedia of chess openings marketed by chess informant ( www.sahovski.co.yu ) . as an antidote to the study of opening theory the former world chess champion , bobby fischer , suggested a chess variant known as fischer random chess or chess960 ( www.chessvariants.org/diffsetup.dir/fischer.html ) , where the initial position of the chess pieces is randomised .",
    "due to the 960 different starting positions in chess960 , knowledge of current chess opening theory is not very useful , and thus the strongest player will win without having to memorise lengthy opening variations .",
    "chess960 is becoming a popular variant of chess but , at least in the near future , it is unlikely to replace classical chess which still fascinates millions world wide .    as the top chess engines now compete at grandmaster level , the opening book has become an important feature contributing to their success .",
    "these days it quite normal for an opening book specialist to be an integral part of the development team of a chess engine . as an example of computer chess opening preparation ,",
    "back in 1995 fritz 3 defeated a prototype of deep blue in the world computer chess championship when deep blue made a crucial mistake as it went out of its opening book and had to assess the position using its search and evaluation engine . for its matches against garry kasparov in 1997 , the deep blue team included grandmaster joel benjamin , who was responsible for developing deep blue s knowledge and fine tuning its opening book @xcite .",
    "since then it has become common practice to include a grandmaster level chess player in the chess engine s team especially for high profile man - machine matches .    due to the importance of the opening book as a component of a chess engine ,",
    "computer chess programmers have been developing automated methods for improving the quality of their books . for a game such as chess , having a rich and well developed opening theory , a good starting point for building an opening book is to have available a large database of high - quality games with a sizeable proportion of recent game records .",
    "game statistics including a summary of the game results when the move was played , the popularity of the move in the database , how strong are the players of the move , and how recently the move was played , can be weighted to produce an evaluation of the `` goodness '' of a move that can inform the chess engine s evaluation function .",
    "deep blue utilised these statistics to automatically extend its relatively small hand - crafted opening book , which consisted of about 4000 positions @xcite , and , similarly hydra extends its relatively small opening book , typically containing about 10 moves per variation ( www.hydrachess.com/hydrachess/faq.php ) .",
    "while deep blue combines the `` goodness '' factors in a non - linear fashion in order to influence the choice of move in the absence of information from its opening book @xcite , hydra combines the `` goodness '' factors in a linear fashion to influence the choice of playable moves @xcite . an opening book and its extension constructed by the above method",
    "will not be perfect , simply due to the fact that opening theory is still dynamic , and the statistics often reflect what is fashionable rather than what is objectively best .",
    "hydra takes this factor into account by adjusting the thinking time of a move when the engine chooses a book move in preference to a move selected by the engine .    in games such as awari , where large databases of games do not exist ,",
    "the above techniques can not be applied , so the opening book needs to be constructed by using the game engine to perform deep searches and generate the evaluation of the positions to be stored in the book @xcite .",
    "a best - first search method was proposed by buro @xcite , where at each level the move with the highest score is expanded first . in this way",
    "bad moves are ignored and no human intervention is necessary . however , this method ignores moves that are not much worst than the best move , thus allowing an opponent to `` drop out '' of the book after a few moves and forcing the chess engine to assess positions using its search and evaluation algorithms .",
    "to avoid this situation lincke @xcite proposed to expand moves in such a way that priority is given to moves at lower search levels , whose score is within a tolerance level from the best move .",
    "it is also useful to incorporate some form of learning to tune the opening book in order to avoid playing the same mistake repeatedly .",
    "a method developed by hyatt @xcite looks at the next ten move evaluations in games it played after the opening book was left , and extrapolates an approximation of the true value to store in the book as a learnt value for the position .",
    "the learning is conditioned upon the depth of searches that produced the learnt value , the strength of the opposition in the game played , and whether the engine or its opponent made a mistake .",
    "we now give an overview of the experiment we have carried out .",
    "for the purpose of data analysis we used the _ nunn2 _ test suite devised by grandmaster dr .",
    "john nunn to test chess engines strength on a variety of late opening / early middle - game positions ; the nunn2 test is distributed by chessbase together with its chess engine , fritz .",
    "the nunn2 test was chosen , since its 25 positions arise from a variety of openings with different characteristics , and for all these positions there are several reasonable candidate moves .",
    "we augmented the nunn2 test with the initial position , as we were interested to find out which first moves do humans and machines prefer .    to compare the choices of humans to those of engines , we made use of two high - quality opening books : _ powerbook 2005 _ , marketed by chessbase , derived from a large collection of human versus human games , and _",
    "comp2005 _ derived from a large collection of machine versus machine games compiled by walter eigenmann ( www.beepworld.de/members38/eigenmann ) . for each position we collected the statistics related to the move choices for the position from both opening books , including the rank of each move choice ,",
    "the number of games in the database in which the move choice was played , and the percentage score achieved for this choice .    the analysis we carried out from the data compared both the distribution of the move choices and the ranks of the choices implied by this distribution .",
    "the ranks of the moves made by humans and engines were compared using a nonparametric association measure we have used in previous studies , where we compared move choices of different chess engines @xcite and the ranking of search results by web search engines @xcite .",
    "the measure is a weighted version of spearman s footrule @xcite , which we call the m - measure .",
    "the distributions of move choices were compared using the jensen - shannon divergence ( jsd ) nonparametric measure @xcite , which allows us to measure the similarity between two distributions .",
    "in addition , for each position we computed the degree of overlap between move choices of humans and engines and the expected percentage score for the position , i.e. out of the total number of games played from the position what was the percentage of wins and draws .",
    "the results show a surprisingly close association between humans and machines opening books .",
    "the m - measure is over 0.75 while the jsd is just above 0.70 , on average , on a scale between 0 and 1 .",
    "it is also shown that , apart from two outliers , the m - measure and jsd are highly correlated with a correlation coefficient just above 0.65 . moreover ,",
    "the degree of overlap between move choices is also just above 0.60 on average , so despite the strong association between humans and machines choice of opening moves there are also differences , although these disparate moves do not tend to be the highly ranked moves .",
    "finally , for the positions we investigated , the expected scores from white s point of view were similar , on average over 55% , for both humans and machines , which indicates a significant advantage to white .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : measures ] we describe the measures we used to compare the rankings induced by the two opening books . in section  [ sec : data ] we give the detail of the data collection phase . in section",
    "[ sec : analysis ] we present the data analysis carried out and interpret the results . in section  [ sec : discuss ] we discuss possible extensions and applications of the comparison techniques we have used , and finally , in section  [ sec : concluding ] we give our concluding remarks .",
    "we used several nonparametric measures @xcite to test the correspondence between the two opening books . to illustrate the measures consider the initial chess position and",
    "assume that only the top-10 move choices were recorded in powerbook 2005 ( pb ) and in comp2005 ( comp ) .",
    "( in the experiment 20 moves were actually recorded in each opening book for the initial position . )",
    "the data collected is shown in table  [ table : top10 ] , where the second and fourth column indicate the rank of the move in pb and comp , respectively , while the third and fifth columns indicate the popularity ( i.e. the number of games in the database in which the move was played ) in pb and comp , respectively ; a zero entry in a column implies that no games were recorded for that move in the corresponding opening book .",
    "12 pt    .[table : top10 ] data for top-10 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,>,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "possible extensions and applications of the comparison techniques we have presented are :    1 .   applying the technique to more comprehensive test sets such as the don dailey test @xcite , which consists of 200 positions all of which are 5 moves for each player from the initial position . a more principled approach could also be taken by collecting positions from the encyclopedia of chess openings classification system .",
    "2 .   comparing opening books of two individuals , be they human or machine . to carry out",
    "such a comparison we need to have game databases of sufficient size , from which we can construct the respective opening books .",
    "3 .   comparing how an opening book changes over time .",
    "for example , we could compare powerbook 2005 to the newer powerbook 2006 .",
    "extend the technique to middle game and endgame positions with the aid of test sets such as the wm test of gurevich and schumacher of positions from world champion games ; the wm test can be downloaded from www.computerschach.de .",
    "this is more applicable to comparing the move choices of two available chess engines , which can display the ranking of the top - n move choices being considered , since , in general , there may be several reasonable moves from such positions and in game records we have access only to the move that was chosen .",
    "5 .   applying the similarity m - measure to tuning the weights of evaluation function features such as material balance , mobility , development , pawn structure , and king safety @xcite to those of a specific chess engine .",
    "the principle underlying such a technique is to compare , via the m - measure , the top - n move choices of the evaluation function we are training to the top - n move choices of the chess engine we are learning from , and to apply a gradient descent ( or hill climbing ) method to adjust the weights in the direction of the function we are learning from ( cf .",
    "we have compared the opening books of humans and computers using nonparametric measures .",
    "it seems that there is a strong association between the two books , as the m - measure is over 0.75 and the jsd just above 0.70 , on average .",
    "the degree of overlap of move choices is just above 0.60 , on average , so despite the correspondence there are also significant differences .",
    "moreover , for the positions we investigated , the expected scores from white s point of view were , on average over 55% , for both humans and machines , which indicates a significant advantage to white for the positions we considered .",
    "more experiments need to be carried out on different test sets covering either a wider range of opening variations or , alternatively , specialising within a small number of popular opening variations . as mentioned in section  [ sec : discuss ] the method we have presented can be used to compare two individuals opening choices , be they human or machine . apart from a better understanding of the difference between human and machine players",
    "such a comparison may help detect anomalies in an opening book that could be exploited during a match .",
    "finally , the m - measure , or a refinement of it , does not rely on statistics being readily available , so could be used as a similarity measure in learning the evaluation function of an opponent ."
