    "most experimental observations at particle accelerators fit the standard model ( sm ) very well . however , there are some major puzzles to be solved",
    ". one needs to have physics beyond the standard model ( bsm ) to explain the presence of dark matter , explain quantitatively the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe , and to explain the puzzle of dark energy . looking for signs of bsm",
    ", one finds that most of the terrestrial experimental observations that are in tension with the sm results are in the properties of third generation fermions . for example",
    "@xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 forward backward asymmetry ( afb ) at lep and tevatron @xcite show such deviations .",
    "one of these long standing puzzles is the top - quark afb measured by the d0 and cdf detectors at the tevatron collider in 2008 @xcite .",
    "these observations by two independent collaborations were updated with full data from the tevatron and were consistent with each other and in tension with the sm calculations until 2015 .",
    "recent experimental results from @xmath7 @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite point towards the possibility that the anomalous nature of these observations may be a statistical phenomenon .    due to its large mass which is close to the electroweak scale and the implied connection with electroweak symmetry breaking ,",
    "the top quark is an important laboratory for various bsm searches at colliders .",
    "in fact various proposals put forward to solve the different theoretical problems of the sm often involve modifications in the top sector .",
    "various extensions to the sm have also been proposed inspired by the possibly anomalous value of measured top - afb at the tevatron .",
    "these bsm proposals involve explanation of the afb in terms of processes involving a ) @xmath2-channel resonances like the axigluon , kk gluon , coloron @xcite or b ) t - channel exchange of particles with different spin and sm charges like the @xmath8 , diquarks etc @xcite .",
    "effective operator approach has also been used in this context @xcite .",
    "measurements of other related observables such as lepton angular asymmetries and @xmath9 invariant - mass dependence of the top quark afb are also compatible with the hypothesis of a heavy bsm particle , see for example @xcite .    in this study , we will focus on the lepton + jets final state ( @xmath10 ) of the @xmath1 pair production process .",
    "this channel has a larger cross - section as compared to the dilepton + jets channel , and it has a much smaller background compared to the all jets channel . for lighter quarks , hadronization smears the information available about their spin and polarization .",
    "the mass of the top quark is large enough that it decays into its daughter particles before strong interactions can initiate the hadronization process .",
    "hence top - quark polarization leaves a memory in the kinematic distribution of the decay products and can be tracked @xcite .",
    "we study the correlations between various kinematic asymmetries and polarization to distinguish between different sources of these asymmetries within an @xmath2-channel ( axigluon ) and a @xmath11-channel ( diquark ) extension of the sm . for the tevatron ,",
    "the top pair production process is dominated by @xmath12 collisions and at the lhc it is dominated by @xmath13 collisions which means that new physics can manifest at differently at the two colliders .    a wide variety of observables have been studied in the literature to explore the top sector as a bsm portal @xcite .",
    "a brief review of some of these observables which have been experimentally measured and are relevant to this work is presented in section [ sec : status - of - experimental ] . in section [ sec : flavor - non - universal - axigluon],[sec : u - channel - scalar - model ] we describe the flavour non - universal axigluon and diquark models which we use as templates for our analysis .",

    "observed values of polarization from cms and atlas are compatible with @xmath147 , which covers a large region of parameter space for both axigluon and diquark models . as in the case of the tevatron , polarization is an important discriminant between models for the lhc as well , especially when combined with decay - lepton asymmetries .",
    "it is able to distinguish overlapping parameter space regions between the two models .",
    "this is more true when the couplings are small and the bsm effects are more difficult to detect as the @xmath2-channel and @xmath3-channel exchanges predict small polarization , but with opposite signs in this region . the energy asymmetry becomes smaller for the lhc at 13 tev due to the effect of the overall boost .",
    "the values of azimuthal and polar asymmetries do not change significantly for higher energy and so remain good observables for the study of top quark dynamics .",
    "as remarked earlier , keeping full spin correlations between the production and decay of the top quark in a coherent manner requires the spin density matrix formalism . in this formalism",
    ", the top polarization , which played a significant role in the above analysis , corresponds to the difference in the diagonal elements of the density matrix , as seen from eqn ( [ eq : polarization ] ) .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix can also be significant in practice , and they would contribute to the transverse polarization of the top quark , corresponding to a spin quantization axis transverse to the momentum . in sm , these terms arise at loop level and have been studied in the literature along - with transverse polarization and observables have been suggested to measure their contribution @xcite .",
    "we examine in this section what role these off - diagonal matrix elements and transverse top polarization play in the two models considered in this study .    following the formalism developed in @xcite , the spin density matrix integrated over a suitable final - state phase space",
    "can be written as @xmath148 , where @xmath149 represents the unpolarized cross section .",
    "the matrix @xmath150 can be written as @xmath151 here @xmath152 is the longitudinal polarization , @xmath153 and @xmath154 are polarizations along two transverse directions .",
    "the expressions for the @xmath155 in terms of the top - quark density matrix @xmath156 can be written as , @xmath157 splitting the top density matrix as shown in eqn ( [ eq : total_amp sq ] ) under the narrow - width approximation , the helicity - dependent decay density matrix in the rest frame of top quark separates into a simple functions of the decay angle : @xmath158 where @xmath159 @xmath160 is the solid angle in which the lepton is emitted and @xmath161 is the integrated contribution of the rest of the decay kinematic variables .",
    "the resulting lepton angular distribution in the lab frame is , @xmath162 the off - diagonal elements in the top - quark production density matrix do not contribute to the total cross - section due to an overall factor of @xmath163 which integrates to 0 .",
    "they do contribute instead to the kinematic distributions of the decay particle , although this effect is quite small for most observables .    in this study , we find that the lepton polar angle asymmetry defined in the lab frame is sensitive to the off - diagonal terms in the top quark density matrix eqn ( [ eq : top - density - matrix ] ) .",
    "the transverse polarization originating from these off - diagonal terms contains further information about the dynamics of top - quark interaction .",
    "this relation has been pointed out before in the context of a wide - width colour octet bsm particle @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lepton - asymmetry - transverse - pol ] we study the contribution of off - diagonal terms to the lepton distributions and present the distributions for a few sample masses of bsm particles .",
    "it can be seen that the contribution of the off - diagonal density matrix elements can be significant , and is particularly important for the diquark model .",
    "these can in turn lead to significant transverse polarization of the top for appropriate range of parameters which could be measured experimentally .",
    "the forward backward asymmetry of the top quark in top - pair production process at the tevatron collider was , for a long time , anomalously large and a persistent effect observed independently by both d0 and cdf detectors .",
    "it has been demonstrated only relatively recently that nnlo contributions give rise to an @xmath164 of the right order of magnitude and seems to be in agreement with the values measured experimentally .",
    "previously , many bsm models had been proposed with parity breaking interactions to explain the observed @xmath164 .",
    "many of these models predicted a charge asymmetry at the lhc . since lhc has a gluon dominated initial state as opposed to the tevatron where @xmath165 was the primary initial state , the asymmetries predicted for lhc coming from the bsm couplings to the quarks get diluted .",
    "the data gives values for @xmath166 consistent with the sm and so far there has been no evidence for the new particles predicted in the different bsm models . under these circumstances",
    "there is a need to construct measures which can distinguish between different sources of the @xmath164 : either sm or bsm .",
    "one such measure is provided by polarization of the top quark which has a non - zero value in the presence of a parity breaking interaction . within sm ,",
    "top polarization is close to 0 .",
    "observables that correlate with top polarization can be used to distinguish between various sm and bsm contributions . in continuation to a previous work where correlations between polarization and forward backward asymmetry were used to constraint bsm @xcite , we have introduced the correlations between lepton polar , azimuthal and energy asymmetries and top charge asymmetry and showed how they can be used together with top longitudinal polarization to distinguish between sm and bsm .    in the reference",
    "@xcite the authors have constructed dilepton central charge and azimuthal asymmetries and studied it along with top quark polarization , forward backward asymmetry and @xmath9 spin correlations for benchmark models of g and w. subsequently , in reference @xcite the authors have shown that the lepton polar asymmetry and top forward backward asymmetry and lepton charge asymmetry vs top charge asymmetry correlations can be useful in the study of w and g models .",
    "our work adds multiple new observables to the analysis of new physics in @xmath9 pair production which include single - lepton azimuthal angle , energy and polar angle ( wrt top quark ) in the lab frame which show signatures from parity breaking in top interactions and help isolate and constrain the interactions of bsm particles .",
    "we demonstrate the efficacy of the correlations between forward backward asymmetry and the lepton asymmetries at tevatron and charge asymmetry and lepton angluar , energy asymmetries at lhc , by utilizing a representative s - channel model , axigluon and an u - channel model , diquark .",
    "constraints on these models are obtained based on measured values of @xmath9 cross - section at tevatron and lhc 7tev , @xmath164 and @xmath167 and resonance searches in dijet , four jet cross sections .",
    "the parameter space of axigluon allowed within 2-@xmath168 of the measured values of the stated observables includes a lower bound on the mass of axigluon at 1.5 tev with a corresponding coupling @xmath92 .",
    "the allowed mass of the diquark is bounded from below by 300 gev and masses above are allowed with the coupling of the model bounded from above by a value of 0.2 for smaller masses which rises to @xmath169 corresponding to @xmath170 tev .",
    "another sliver of parameter space is allowed for larger couplings of the diquark due to destructive interference effects .",
    "for the first time we have presented the complete density matrix of the top quark , including the off - diagonal elements for top quark pair production process , in the axigluon and diquark models to aid further studies .",
    "we use these to show that the lepton polar asymmetry in the lab frame shows a correlation with the transverse polarization of the top quark for axigluon model and even more significantly for the diquark model .",
    "the lepton asymmetry usually considered in studies of top polarization is calculated from lepton polar angle with respect to the top quark and it does not show this correlation with transverse polarization .",
    "the correlation of transverse polarization with lepton azimuthal or energy asymmetry is also very small .",
    "finally , we extend our analysis to 13 tev lhc where , even though the values of the asymmetries get diluted , the correlations between accurate measurements of charge asymmetry and lepton asymmetries still separate out bsm and the sm in the 2 dimensional space . taken together , these correlations can indeed be used to improve significance of the constraints on bsm from lhc data even in the initial stages of low luminosity .",
    "since the ac calculated at nlo for 13tev lhc was unavailable at the time of submission of this work , we note that the available charge asymmetry values @xcite form a smooth function of the beam energy and fit them to a polynomial to find the ac as a function of the beam energy .",
    "we obtain a fit to a polynomial presented in eqn ( [ eq : ac - fit ] ) with goodness of fit parameter @xmath171 .",
    "@xmath172    this gives a value of ac(13 tev)=0.0063 .",
    "to present the dependence on top boost and polar angle clearly the amplitude square is written in terms of the polar angle @xmath62 in @xmath1 center of momentum frame .",
    "the off - diagonal terms in the gluon initiated process are zero and the diagonal terms in gluon initiated process are not dependent on the top quark polarization therefore we have omitted these here and they can be found in many references including @xcite .",
    "decay width of axigluon at tree level is given by , @xmath179      the top - quark spin density matrix for the @xmath3-channel exchange is given below in @xmath1 center of momentum frame .",
