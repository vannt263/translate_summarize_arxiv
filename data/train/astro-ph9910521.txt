    "they found that the oxygen abundance distribution was similar or maybe slightly deficient when compared with the solar neighbourhood one  which is compatible with today s knowledge of the galactic bulge star abundances .",
    "they found as well that the n / o ratio was higher for galactic bulge planetary nebulae than for the disk ones , which requires ( 1 ) that the galactic bulge planetary nebulae progenitors were younger than the disk ones , in contradiction with the stellar data , or ( 2 ) that the pn progenitor star nucleosynthesis history was different in the bulge and in the disk .",

    "this motivated us to obtain a sample of high quality pn spectra .",
    "belonging to the galactic bulge can be a tricky question , because of the contamination of foreground objects . for planetary nebulae ,",
    "clear criteria have been identified by acker et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , that , according to them , allow to reduce the contamination of foreground objects down to less than 10% .",

    "we have built a sample of planetary nebulae in the direction of the bulge responding as far as possible to the criteria identified by acker et al .",
    "+ we obtained spectra for a sample of 30 planetary nebulae responding to these criteria .",
    "the only pn of our sample that does not respond to these criteria is pn  g  351.1  +  04.8 ( m  1  -  19 ) , but although it is not within 5 degrees of the galactic center , it is quite close , and it agrees with all the other criteria .",
    "thus , we can assume that most of the pn of our sample actually belong to the galactic bulge .",

    "it is due to the fact that high oxygen abundance pn have low temperatures , and thus intrinsically weak [ oiii ]  436.3 lines , which are thus highly affected by the noise .",

    "these lines are measured in low s / n conditions .",
    "therefore , they enhance the level of the uncertainty .",

    "the uncertainties on the sulphur and argon abundances generally follow , although not as clearly , the tendencies of the uncertainties on the oxygen abundances , with an envelope of the uncertainties of 0.20.3 dex .",
    "this is due to the chain of icfs leading to the elemental abundances of sulphur and argon .",
    "+ as well , the few planetary nebulae that are well above these uncertainties are the same as in the case of oxygen , for the same reasons . + it should be added that the uncertainties on sulphur are clearly underevaluated , because of the inadequacy of the sulphur icf , as quoted in cuisinier et al .

    "the uncertainty on the argon abundance should as well be underevaluated , to a lesser extent : the icf on argon shows a systematic effect of @xmath9 0.1dex ( kppen et al .",
    "+ finally , the chlorine abundances lie at higher uncertainty levels than the other ones , at 0.30.4 dex , with no systematic tendency , neither with abundance , nor with excitation class .",
    "this is due to the faintness of the chlorine lines  which are measured at much lower s / n ratios than the other ones .",

    "these lines are also present in our observation of this planetary nebula , at a reasonable s / n and the oxygen abundance derivations are very different ( 0.8 dex ! ) .",
    "we attribute the difference to the contamination of [ oiii ] 436.3 nm line by hg 435.9 from the city lights in aller & keyes observations .",

    "the case of m  1  -  42 is a bit more tricky , because the nitrogen abundance is very different , whereas the oxygen abundance is very similar ( in aller & keyes 1987 ) .",

    "this combines with the problems in the deconvolution of [ oiii ]  436.3  nm .",

    "the solar neighbourhood g - dwarfs can be considered to be more representative of the disk iron abundances than mc william giants , because mc william giants were selected on luminosity criteria , and are therefore biased in favour of massive stars , that should be slightly more metal - rich , as stated in mc  william & rich 1994 .",

    "+      helium and nitrogen , contrarely to oxygen , sulphur , and argon , are synthetized in the progenitors of pn .",
    "thus , these elements do not allow us to trace the chemical composition of the interstellar medium when the progenitor star was born , and hence they do not allow us to trace the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium .    on the other hand , and",
    "although it is not yet well quantified theoretically , the enrichment in these elements should be connected with the mass of the progenitors , and thus , with their ages ( cazetta & maciel 1999 , stasinska & tylenda 1990 , kaler 1983,1985 , peimbert & torres  peimbert 1983 , aller 1987 et al . ) .",
    "+ the n / o ratio abundance ratio distribution should therefore reflect a mixture of the chemical evolution of nitrogen and oxygen before progenitor stars were formed , ( 2 ) the progenitor own nucleosynthesis .",
    "+ it is noteworthy that the highest metallicity ( e.g. oxygen abundance ) galaxies do not produce n / o ratios higher than @xmath22 ( vila  costas & edmunds 1993 ) . within errors , this is also the upper limit of the n / o distribution of our sample ( fig . 6 ) .",
    "however , the disk pn n / o ratio distribution extends to much higher values  due to the nucleosynthesis of massive progenitor stars ( the kolmogorov  smirnoff probability that the n / o distributions are different is 74% ) .",
    "thus , the most recent population of pn in the disk is clearly absent from the bulge .",
    "this is what should be expected from stellar observations , showing that the turnoff lies around @xmath23 ( ortolani 1998 ) , and is therefore an old population . + the helium abundances",
    "although not as clear , show a similar effect , as can be seen in figure 7 : the most abundant objects that are present in in the disk are absent in the bulge .",
    "the distribution encountered in the bulge compares with the disk pn , if the high helium abundance type i pn are excluded .",
    "we see that the mean value that we encounter , @xmath24 ( on a linear scale , considering only our best data ) , is lower than the pristine helium abundance predicted by chemical evolution models for the bulge ( @xmath25)(catelan & de freitas pacheco 1996 ) .",
    "helium abundances can only be obtained from indirect methods for stars in the bulge , like differential counts in color magnitude diagrams .",
    "although they can therefore considered to be not as trustworthy as the nebular abundances , good quality data seem to favour low helium abundance values ( he / h=0.098)(minniti 1995 ) , although higher values have been reported from lower quality data ( renzini 1994 ) .",
    "it seems that here as well , helium does not follow the overproduction predicted by chemical evolution models for a prompt enrichment .",
    "we observed a sample of 30 planetary nebulae in the galactic bulge with high quality spectroscopy , for which we derived plasma parameters , and abundances of o , s , ar , cl , n , and he .",
    "+ we evaluated random uncertainties with appropriate simulations , which were for these highly reddened planetary nebulae of the order of 0.02 dex for helium , of 0.2 dex for oxygen , sulphur , and argon , and of 0.4 dex for chlorine .",
    "we compared the abundances we obtained with abundances derived by other authors , and our abundances fitted well within our estimations of the uncertainties .",
    "+ we compared the abundances in o , s , ar of the planetary nebulae from our galactic bulge sample with the abundances in planetary nebulae from the galactic disk .",
    "we found them to be comparable , planetary nebulae with high abundances in these elements being slightly more numerous  which is compatible with the findings from the stars .",
    "the abundances in n / o and he showed a lack of high n / o and high he planetary nebulae in the galactic bulge , suggesting that the bulge planetary nebulae have old progenitor stars , and here as well are similar to the stellar population .",
    "thus , the main results that appear from our observations are that : ( 1 ) the abundances in o , s , and ar do not contradict the stellar observations in the bulge ( 2 ) from the n / o ratio derivations , it seems that the bulge planetary nebulae are an old population , like the stars . +",
    "if the abundances that can be derived from stars and planetary nebulae in the galactic bulge are not contradictory , the pattern that is found can still be considered as very puzzling : if there is no doubt that the most recent population that is encountered in the galactic disk does not appear either in the planetary nebulae or in the stars , some elements favour a prompt chemical enrichment ( mg and ti ) , and other favour a much slower chemical evolution history ( he , o , si , s , ar and ca ) .    f.c .",
