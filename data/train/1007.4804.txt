    "this article , as the title literally suggests , is a survey of the amenability results around fourier and fourier - stieltjes algebras which are known to the author .",
    "these are displayed in comparison to the results on group and measure algebras .",
    "in particular , i intend to highlight the indispensable role which operator spaces play in this theory .",
    "the scope of this article has been purposely restricted to only amenability properties of fourier and fourier - stieltjes algebras , and to the motivating results in their dual objects , group and measure algebras .",
    "there are , thus , clear omissions of discussions of herz  fig - talamanca algebras @xmath5 , in general , and their amenability properties ; and of locally compact quantum groups or even kac algebras , though they do provide a convenient language for discussing the duality .",
    "however , limited liberty is taken to indicate some relevant literature on such topics , as they relate to the present article .",
    "the scope of this article has been restricted mainly because the topic has reached a certain maturity , though there are still interesting open problems on fourier and fourier - stieltjes algebras .",
    "moreover , it is hoped that this limitation in scope improves coherence and depth , though at the cost of breadth .",
    "we acknowledge that this is far from being the first survey of amenability problems in fourier and fourier - stieltjes algebras .",
    "see surveys of runde  @xcite and kaniuth and lau  @xcite .",

    "these algebras represent complete invariants for the underlying group in the sense that if @xmath6 is another locally compact group for which @xmath7 , or @xmath8 , isometrically isomorphically , then @xmath9 isomorphically and homeomorphically , as shown by wendel  @xcite .",

    "their respective images @xmath2  and @xmath1 , each endowed with the norm which makes the transform an isometry , are thus banach algebras of functions , which are invariants for @xmath0 .",
    "it follows from jordan decomposition in @xmath13 , and bochner s theorem , that @xmath2  is the span of continuous positive definite functions ; and then a version of the gelfand - naimark - segal construction shows that @xmath2  consists of the family of continuous matrix coefficients of all unitary representations on @xmath0 . since each element of @xmath3  factors as a pointwise product of two square - integrable functions , i.e.  @xmath14 , it follows from the plancherel theorem that @xmath15 .",
