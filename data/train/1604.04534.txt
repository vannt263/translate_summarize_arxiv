    "one of the fundamental obstacles in statistically detecting the 21-cm signal coming from the epoch of reionization ( eor ) is the leakage of polarized signal into total intensity caused by the time - frequency - baseline - direction dependent primary beams of the telescope .",
    "the galactic diffuse foreground , the most dominant contaminant of the eor signal after the extragalactic compact sources ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , is expected to be separated from the signal by utilizing the fact that the foreground is spectrally smooth and the signal is not @xcite .",
    "however , the faraday - rotated polarized foreground is also not smooth along frequency , and its leakage into total intensity might mimic the frequency structure of the eor signal making the separation of the two difficult ( * ? ? ?",

    ", ska @xcite will be affected by ` polarization leakage ' to various degrees depending on the directional gain properties and the fields of view of the instruments .",
    "a number of papers dealing with the direction dependent ( dd ) gains , i. e. the primary beam , of low frequency radio telescopes have been published recently that shows the relevance of polarimetric analysis in the detection of the eor signal .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the effects of the stokes @xmath0 primary beam of mwa that can leak power from the foreground wedge into the eor window , claiming that the foreground in even the sidelobes of the primary beam needs to be modeled and removed for a successful detection of the eor signal as the farther the source is from the phase center the worse the leakage of power from the wedge .",
    "polarized power will be leaked from the wedge in a similar way albeit to a much lower amplitude .",
    "efforts are underway to better understand the mwa beam and calculate the accuracy of the beam model .",
    "@xcite found that with the ` full embedded element pattern ' model , the beam can be 25% different from reality . with the improved model they found that a @xmath6 leakage of a few per cent ( with outliers up to 10% ) is achievable which is higher than that of the lofar case , as the field of view of an mwa tile is significantly higher than that of a lofar station .",
    "some preliminary results of the ` intrinsic cross - polarization ratio ' ( ixr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of mwa tiles @xcite have been published .",
    "@xcite show an example of the variation of ixr@xmath7 ( @xmath8 calculated in terms of jones matrices ; see @xcite for more details ) of a simple all sky dipole element at 130 mhz .",
    "the beam model exhibits an ixr@xmath7 of 70 db toward the zenith with a low - ixr@xmath7 structure along the 45 degree line between the orthogonal receptors , and based on this model they have used a polarization leakage of up to -30 db in their simulations of pulsar times of arrival",
    ". a stringent limit on the accuracy of the model beamwidth of a wide - field transit radio telescope has been set by @xcite . by simulating the chime observations of the foreground - contaminated 21-cm signal in the presence of instrumental errors",
    ", they have found that in order to recover unbiased power spectra , the model beamwidth of each element should be known to an accuracy of at least 0.1% within each minute .",
    "compared to beamwidth , beamshape errors would be even more difficult to model and hence would be a more problematic source of bias in the power spectra .",
    "in a previous paper ( a15 ) , we predicted the polarization leakage from stokes @xmath1 to @xmath0 to be expected in the ` eor window ' of the cylindrically averaged power spectra ( ps ) using the lofar observations of the 3c196 field .",
    "the prediction was based on the nominal model beam of lofar produced by @xcite using an electromagnetic simulation of the astron antenna group @xcite .",
    "we found that within a field of view ( fov ) of 3 degrees the rms of the leakage as a fraction of the rms of the polarized emission varies between 0.2 to 0.3 per cent , and the leakage is lower than the eor signal at @xmath9 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "we thus concluded that even a modest polarimetric calibration over the fov would ensure that the polarization leakage remains well below the expected eor signal at scales of 0.021 mpc@xmath10 .",
    "the accuracy of this prediction depends mainly on the accuracy of the model beam .     and",
    "@xmath11 components respectively . ]    .",
    "the color - bar is shown in decibel units .",
    "the left and right panels show the @xmath12 and @xmath11 components respectively . ]    in the current paper , we have used lofar observations of the compact sources in the 3c295 field to quantify the accuracy of the nominal model beam of lofar @xcite , as this field is less contaminated by polarized diffuse emission than the 3c196 field .",
    "in addition to quantifying the accuracy of the beam , we demonstrate the efficiency of a dd calibration method in removing instrumentally polarized compact sources . this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 revisits the nominal model beam of lofar and shows the behavior of the intrinsic cross - polarization ratio of the instrument as a function of distance from the phase center and also distance of the observing field from the zenith . in section 3 , we describe the data reduction , calibration and simulation pipelines .",
    "our results are presented in section 4first , we present the results of the observation and the simulation , then compare them to quantify the accuracy of the beam model , and finally present the results of the dd calibration .",
    "the paper ends with a discussion of our analysis and some concluding remarks .",
    "the primary beams of lofar hba stations are modeled in three steps : an analytic expression is used for the dipole beams whose coefficients are calculated by fitting to a beam raster generated by electromagnetic simulation , the 16 dipole beams are phased in an analog way to create the tile beams , and the tile beam patterns are multiplied together with the respective weights and phases using an ` array factor ' to create the station beams . as a low - frequency aperture array , lofar does not have any moving parts and hence the beams of two orthogonal feeds are projected non - orthogonally away from zenith while tracking a moving source giving rise to mutual coupling between the beams .",
    "the projection - induced mutual coupling is the principal contributor to polarization leakage and its removal completely depends on how well we can model the beam .     at eight different instances of time during an eight hour observation of the 3c295 field .",
    "the texts correspond to the hour angle of the field during the observation which clearly shows that the leakage is lowest at @xmath130.6 h. the solid and dashed lines correspond to the negative and positive hour angles respectively . ]",
    "although projection effects are worse at lower elevation , it is possible to remove the effects of the primary beam to high accuracy toward at least one direction , the phase center , at all elevations using direction independent ( di ) calibration @xcite and a model of the dipole beam ( e. g. a15 ) . after calculating the electronic gains of a station via di calibration and correcting the data for the dipole beam at the phase center ,",
    "only the effect of the array factor and the errors in correcting the dipole beam effects remain , which can be thought of as a differential beam with respect to the phase center .",
    "an example of such a ` differential ' station beam at 150 mhz is shown in fig . [ f : beam ] where the field of view , the nulls and the sidelobes are clearly visible .",
    "the left panel of the figure shows the sum of the diagonal terms of the beam jones matrix , i. e. @xmath12 , and the right panel shows their difference , i. e. @xmath11 .",
    "if we divide the difference by the sum , we obtain the fraction of stokes @xmath0 flux that leaks into stokes @xmath14 . a more intuitive way to calculate this leakage is to use mueller matrices instead of jones matrices , and we calculate the leakage in terms of mueller matrices below and follow the mueller formalism throughout the paper .",
    "[ f : beamnu ] shows the spectral structure of the sum ( left panel ) and the difference ( right panel ) of the diagonal terms of the beam jones matrix and they demonstrate that the position of the sidelobes changes _ smoothly _ as a function of frequency .",
    "we will demonstrate the accuracy of this beam in predicting the polarization leakage .",
    "we will call this leakage the ` off - axis ' leakage as opposed to the ` on - axis ' leakage at the phase center .",
    "off - axis leakage increases as we go away from the phase center and the zenith or , in case the observing field never reaches the local zenith , the culmination point of the field .",
    "a fundamental figure of merit ( fom ) to evaluate the polarization performance of a polarimeter is the intrinsic cross - polarization ratio ( ixr ) introduced by @xcite .",
    "the ` intrinsic ' in ixr signifies that the parameter is independent of the choice of coordinate systems .",
    "ixr is related to the invertibility of a dd jones matrix .",
    "the jones matrices calculated by calibration are inverted and multiplied with the data to give the ` corrected ' data , and hence the intrinsic invertibility of a jones matrix put a fundamental limit to the extent to which a data can be corrected . for stokes polarimeters , ixr can be easily converted to a mueller ixr , or ixr@xmath15 which , in turn , is directly related to the fractional polarization leakage ( fraction of stokes @xmath0 signal leaked into stokes @xmath16 and vice versa ) caused by the beam , mathematically @xmath17 \\text{db } \\label{eq : ixr}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is a @xmath19 mueller matrix corresponding to the outer product of the dd jones matrices of two elements that make up a baseline of an array , and by the subscript ` 10 ' in @xmath20 we mean the second row and first column of the matrix ( for explanation see section 2.2.1 of a15 ) .",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 give leakages from @xmath0 to @xmath14 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 respectively , and @xmath25 gives the stokes @xmath0 beam .",
    "for an example of a mueller matrix that completely characterizes the beam of a baseline see fig . 2 of a15 .",
    "note that ixr@xmath15 is usually taken to be the opposite of this value , the values are usually expressed as a positive integer and in db units .",
    "however , here we express the db values as negative integers so that they correspond to the increment of leakage with distance from the phase center more intuitively .",
    "ixr@xmath15 distributions within the central @xmath26 of the 3c295 field , one of the secondary observing windows of the lofar - eor project , at eight different instances of time during an 8 hour synthesis are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ixr2 ] for example ; the observation time increases as we go from left to right panels on the top , and then from right to left panels on the bottom .",
    "we see that ixr@xmath27 increases as we go away from the phase center of the field and also from the culmination point , and this increment directly corresponds to an increase in leakage .",
    "there is a reversal of orientation of the elliptical shape of the spatial distribution of the ixr@xmath15 which is due to the reversal of the orientation of the projected dipole beams . for a more quantitative understanding",
    "we show the azimuthal profiles of ixr@xmath15 at the same eight instances of time in fig .",
    "[ f : ixr1 ] .",
    "we see the same trend as fig .",
    "[ f : ixr2 ] here : an increase of ixr@xmath15 as we go away from the center and the zenith .",
    "ixr@xmath15 or equivalently the leakage is lowest near the zenith , 3.4 @xmath28 4.5 hours after the beginning of the synthesis .    all plots in this section have been calculated from the model beam of lofar @xcite , the same beam that was used to predict the amount of leakage from linearly polarized diffuse galactic emission into total intensity ( a15 ) .",
    "our main aim in this paper is to demonstrate the accuracy of this model within the fov of a typical lofar hba ( high band antenna , 110200 mhz ) station . after finding the accuracy",
    ", we will be able to constrain our previous prediction more robustly and the need for improvement of the model .",
    "the accuracy has been demonstrated below by comparing the leakage actually seen in an 8-hr synthesis data of the 3c295 field and the leakage predicted by the model beam that we have introduced in this section .",
    "we have used real and simulated lofar observations of the 3c295 field .",
    "this field was chosen because the compact sources in stokes @xmath1 leaked from stokes @xmath0 are less contaminated by diffuse polarized emission compared to the 3c196 field .",
    "observed data were processed using the standard lofar software pipeline , and the simulated observations were produced using the simulation pipeline presented in a15 . in this section ,",
    "we briefly describe the observational setup and data processing steps .",
    "next , the process of simulating the desired observations , taking into account the systematic effects of lofar , by implementing our previous pipeline is described .",
    ".observational parameters of the 3c295 synthesis . [ cols=\"<,<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     for simulating the lofar observations of the 3c295 field , we use the pipeline described in our previous paper , a15 . here",
    "we briefly outline the steps of the simulation specific to this experiment .    1",
    ".   first step in simulating an observation is to create a realistic sky model from observed data that we want to compare with .",
    "we have taken the stokes @xmath0 images for 160 frequency channels and created a sky model using buildsky that uses the available frequency information to calculate the spectral index of each source .",
    "the aim is to predict the leakage from stokes @xmath0 to @xmath1 , hence we do not want to include any polarization in our sky model .",
    "we used a flux cut of 100 mjy to remain well above the local noise around the sources ( @xmath29 mjy / beam ) .",
    "our model consisted of 140 point sources , mainly within the first null of the primary beam , several of which were constructed by more than one components .",
    "note that , we have created a sky model from an image that was not corrected for the primary beam .",
    "therefore , there is a systematic decrease in flux away from the phase center until the first null , and then there are some more sources on the sidelobes of the beam .",
    "the attenuation caused by the primary beam does not pose any difficulty in quantifying the fractional leakages , as the attenuation effect drops out in the ratio of different stokes parameters , the parameter we are interested in . also note that in the case of calibrating real data , sky models are usually constructed from very high resolution images , but for our purpose such precision is not required as , again , we are only interested in the fraction of stokes @xmath0 flux leaked into the other stokes parameters , and not in the absolute stokes @xmath0 flux .",
    "we calculated visibilities from the sky model using the same baselines as that of the observation at all frequency channels and taking into account the station - time - frequency dependent model primary beams of the instrument .",
    "this was done , in effect , by multiplying the fluxes of the individual sources with the beams at the corresponding positions , times and frequencies and fourier transforming them using bbs .",
    "therefore , although the sky was completely unpolarized , the predicted visibilities had non - zero values in all four visibility correlations due to instrumental polarization .",
    "the parameters of this simulated observation are listed in table [ t : sim ] .",
    "note that , the set - up of the instrument was the same for the simulation as that of the observation .",
    "the simulated visibilities were inverted to produce four images corresponding to the four stokes parameters .",
    "same imaging parameters were used in this case as in the case of imaging from the observed data ; the key parameters are listed in table [ t : img ] .",
    "the standard imaging software casa was used for all imaging .",
    "although we created images for all stokes parameters , here we will use only stokes @xmath0 , @xmath14 and @xmath23 images for our analysis , as the snr of @xmath30 leakage is too low to be useful for a comparison between the observation and the simulation .",
    "we used the standard definition of stokes visibilities to calculate the stokes parameters from the visibility correlations , as given by the equations ( 13)a  d of a15 , and the linear polarization @xmath31 was calculated as @xmath32 .",
    "we also created an average of the images of all frequency channels to get an increased snr that will facilitate the extraction of source fluxes .",
    "once we have all the images , the next step was to calculate the fluxes of the sources that we want to compare .",
    "the quantity we use in this case is the ` peak flux ' , as it is straightforward to determine and sufficient for illustrating the difference between the observation and the simulation .",
    "to extract the peak fluxes , first , we created small non - overlapping circular apertures around the point sources of interest in the averaged observed @xmath31 image  as the source must be present in the observed @xmath31 image for us to be able to compare it with the simulation  where the sources are clearly visible due to high snr .",
    "the sizes of the apertures depended on the structure of the sources , some of which had double lobes , but their radii were never more than 3.3 arcmin in an 8.3 degree image of 0.5 arcmin pixel size .",
    "the apertures thus produced from the observed @xmath31 image were used in all images , and the maximum flux within the apertures were extracted in each case . following this method",
    ", we produced eight different lists of the sources with their peak flux corresponding to the stokes @xmath0 , @xmath14 , @xmath23 and the linear polarization @xmath31 images of both the observation and the simulation .",
    "the minimum threshold set during flux extraction depended on the snr of individual images and the numbers will be mentioned when we describe the results of the data analysis and simulation .",
    "the observation also has diffuse polarization , but , as mentioned before , in the 3c295 field this emission is small compared to the 3c196 field , motivating the use of this field rather than the latter ; the diffuse emission in the real data set a lower limit on the accuracy of the measurements in the data .",
    "it should be noted that we do not include the effects of the total intensity of the diffuse foregrounds in our simulations .",
    "one could argue that we would be affected by the total intensity of the diffuse emission here , if the emission was sufficiently bright .",
    "but , we have seen that this is not the case .",
    "in fact , we could not detect any diffuse emission in stokes @xmath0 even after removing the brightest compact sources .",
    "more sources have to be subtracted before we can start looking for diffuse emission in total intensity . however , the case is very different in polarization",
    ". polarized diffuse emission can be comparable to both the instrumentally and intrinsically polarized compact sources .",
    "but , again , we have seen that in the 3c295 field that is not the case . in fact , less contamination from diffuse polarized emission was the very reason we chose this field for this experiment .",
    "for example , note in fig .",
    "[ f : obs ] that very few compact sources are seen through diffuse polarized emission , and even the sources that are , are much brighter than the diffuse emission around them . more details about this figure are described below in section [ s : obs ] .",
    "the figures of merit used in this paper are mainly the fractional linear polarization leakages , equivalent to the degrees of polarization .",
    "however , we also calculate the leakage for stokes @xmath1 separately .",
    "the following three parameters are most frequently used : @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 from now on , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 will refer to the the observed data , and for the simulated data we will use @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the ratios of the corresponding simulated stokes parameters .",
    "the ratio parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the difference parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the figures of merit we are most interested in .",
    "@xmath36 of the sources should follow a rice distribution as they are essentially the degrees of polarization ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "note that these parameters are different from the ixr@xmath15 introduced in section 2 .",
    "@xmath36 is most closely related to the ixr@xmath15 and , as stokes @xmath24 leakage is @xmath48 orders of magnitude lower than the linear polarization leakage ( e. g. see figs . 6 and 11 of a15 ) , the value of @xmath36 should be comparable to ixr@xmath15 in magnitude .",
    "however , we would like to point out that ixr@xmath15 is calculated directly form the model of the beam , whereas @xmath36 is calculated either from the observed data or from the data created by applying the model beam on the sky and , also , in this case the data is averaged over 8 hours within which time the sky moves in the beam . in case of instrumental polarization , @xmath37 is determined by @xmath20 , @xmath38 by @xmath21 and @xmath36 by a combination of them .    ) in the 3c295 field after averaging 149 frequency channels .",
    "most of these point sources are leaked from stokes @xmath0 due to instrumental polarization .",
    "only six sources among them were found to be intrinsically polarized as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : obs - intr ] .",
    "the size of the bubbles indicate the amount of leakage as a percentage of stokes @xmath0 flux , i. e. @xmath36 of our figures of merit . ]      a good way to distinguish between the intrinsic and the instrumental polarization is rotation measure ( rm ) synthesis @xcite .",
    "a linearly polarized wave can undergo faraday rotation , the rotation of its polarization angle ( @xmath49 ) , during its journey from the source to the observer if there are magnetized plasma in between .",
    "this wavelength - dependent rotation is quantified by rotation measure , defined as @xmath50 , which is equivalent to faraday depth @xmath51 if the intervening magneto - ionized medium is assumed to be a single screen ; here @xmath52 is the density of electrons and @xmath53 is the magnetic field component along the line - of - sight component @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 are a fourier conjugate pair , and this fourier relationship is the basis of rm - synthesis , a per - pixel one dimensional fourier transform along @xmath56 for a multi - frequency data . if a source is intrinsically polarized , faraday rotation will introduce spectral structures in the broadband signature of the source . the more it fluctuates along @xmath56 the higher faraday depth it will appear at , a basic consequence of the fourier relationship . on the other hand if the source is not intrinsically polarized , the only broadband signatures that it will have in its polarization is that of the ` differential ' beam , which is very smooth along frequency ( as shown in fig .",

    "we have not cleaned @xmath59 in our analysis , which means in our case @xmath59 is actually the polarized surface brightness convolved with the rotation measure spread function ( rmsf ) , the equivalent of power spread function ( psf ) in imaging .",
    "however , to clearly determine the fluxes and degrees of polarization of the instrumentally polarized sources , we have subtracted the rmsf from the faraday depth profiles , @xmath59 as a function of @xmath55 , for the sources that could be confused with sidelobes .",
    "sometimes a source can appear at a higher faraday depth even if it is not intrinsically polarized due to the sidelobes of the rmsf .",
    "however , sidelobes are usually symmetric whereas real rm structures are not . by subtracting the rmsf we could eliminate the possibility of false detection of intrinsic polarization .",
    "both modeling and calibration have been or are being tested for removing polarization leakage in fourier space . in the former case , leakages are predicted using a model primary beam of the instrument and then deconvolved from visibilities which is essentially similar to primary beam correction in fourier space .",
    "one such method , called aw - projection @xcite , was tested in a15 , and it was found to be able to remove up to 80% leakage .",
    "the latter method solves for the leakages instead of modeling them by minimizing a leakage - free data set , simulated from a sky model , with the observed data toward different directions ; the solutions thus produced are then applied on the observed visibilities to remove leakage .",

    "sagecal s performance in this regard has not been tested yet , and here we perform one such test .",
    "we will show how well it can remove instrumentally polarized point sources by incorporating beam - leakage terms into the gain solutions .",

    "performed using mwa at 189 mhz with an angular resolution of 15.6 arcmin and a noise level of 15 mjy beam@xmath10 , they found only one polarized point source that shows a 320 mjy peak at rm @xmath28 + 34.7 rad m@xmath58 and a polarization fraction of @xmath281.8% . on the other hand ,",
    "in our 10 deg@xmath63 lofar image averaged over 134 to 166 mhz with an angular resolution of 3.44 arcmin and a noise level of 0.15 mjy beam@xmath10 , we have found 6 intrinsically polarized point sources .",
    "this discrepancy is mainly due to the different sensitivities of the two observations .",
    "a polarized source in the mwa observation had to have a flux of at least 75 mjy ( @xmath64 above their noise level ) to be considered a detection , whereas in our case even the brightest intrinsically polarized point source have a flux of only @xmath287 mjy .",
    "@xcite did not find any polarization in the 137 point sources brighter than 4 jy , and concluded that if any of them were polarized , the polarization fraction would be less than @xmath282% .",
    "our result is in general agreement with this conclusion , as we see that even for fainter sources  all our point sources except one are fainter than 2.5 jy in stokes @xmath0the polarization fraction is not more than @xmath281.3% .",
    "we have identified 95 instrumentally polarized sources in the frequency - averaged image of the visiblities predicted using the unpolarized sky model created from observation .",
    "sources appear in stokes @xmath14 and @xmath23 because of the primary beam induced leakage and their degrees of polarization @xmath39 are shown as bubbles in fig .",

    "only the sources within the first null of the primary beam are shown here , as the current software for simulating visibilities can reproduce the effects of the ` real ' primary beam well only within the fov .",
    "the polarization leakage from outside the fov only comes in via the sidelobes and is a very small effect and because the eor analysis is limited to the fov , this is the only region of interest in terms of polarization leakage .",
    "leakages from stokes @xmath0 into polarization increases as a function of distance from the phase center and they range from 0.05 to 1.22 per cent as shown by the sizes of the bubbles .",
    "this is consistent with the fractional leakages observed in the 3c196 field which is expected as the two fields roughly have similar declinations .",

    "[ f : obs ] , [ f : model ] and [ f : ratio ] is that the observed leakage is almost always more than the one induced by the model beam which seems to show that the model beam is under - predicting the leakage , but one should note that the observed data has noise and diffuse emission that contribute to the estimation of source fluxes .",
    "the observed leakage is seen to be 0.75 to 4.61 times higher than the predicted leakage , but for most of the sources the ratio is less than 2 .",
    "the overestimation of the degrees of polarization in the observed data could be due to the well - known bias in the presence of noise @xcite , and the diffuse emission faintly visible in fig .",

    "fluxes of the sources .",
    "more scatter at the dimmer end indicates errors related to extracting flux of dim sources . ]     ( blue ) and @xmath23 ( red ) . ]",
    "a more natural way to calculate the accuracy of the beam would be to compare the leakages into stokes @xmath14 and @xmath23 separately and take the difference between the observed and predicted leakages , i. e. @xmath46 and @xmath47 , instead of their ratios .",
    "a bar chart of these difference parameters are plotted together in fig .",
    "[ f : hist ] .",
    "as individual stokes parameters follow gaussian noise statistics , their difference should also be gaussian , and although here we rescale the gaussian by taking the difference between the _ ratios _ of stokes parameters and although the diffuse foreground might not follow gaussian noise , the distribution still approximately follows a gaussian .",
    "both @xmath46 and @xmath47 follow approximately a gaussian with means close to zero ( 0.02 for @xmath14 and -0.03 for @xmath23 ) and a standard deviation @xmath65 of 0.3 .",
    "therefore , we can say with a 68% certainty that the leakage predicted by the model beam of lofar will be 30% different from the actual leakage .",
    "if the actual leakage is @xmath28 1% , the model beam might predict the leakage to be around 0.7%  1.3% .    we have calculated the uncertainty in the prediction of the beam model induced polarization leakage , but there are uncertainties in that uncertainty arising from the errors in extracting fluxes of the sources . to show these uncertainties we plot the fom @xmath46 and @xmath47 for the sources as a function of their stokes @xmath0 fluxes in fig .",
    "[ f : mqmu - i ] , and as a function of their distances from the phase center in fig .",
    "[ f : mqmu - d ] . in the former plot , as the flux of the source decreases thereby decreasing the local snr of the source and enhancing the effect of the gaussian noise , the random scatter of the aforementioned fom increases .",
    "therefore , this trend can be attributed to the gaussian noise in the image that leaves its imprint on the extracted fluxes . as sources are attenuated as we go away from the phase center due to the azimuthally decreasing primary beam , we should expect an increase in the scatter of the fom as we go outward from the phase center , and this is exactly what we see in the latter figure .",
    "hence , this incremental trend of the fom as a function of distance from the center should not be attributed to a systematic bias in the model of the beam , but again to the imprint of the image noise on the extracted fluxes .    as , here",
    ", we are mainly limited by the image noise and the errors in extracting fluxes of faint sources , one would expect the uncertainty in the calculation of the accuracy of the beam model to go down if a higher flux density cut is used .",
    "and we see exactly this trend .",
    "we have taken only the 18 sources brighter than 600 mjy in stokes @xmath0 and made bar charts similar to that of fig .",
    "[ f : hist ] and found that the standard deviation indeed improves significantly  although the mean of @xmath46 remained 0.02% , its standard deviation improved to 0.1% . on the other hand , for the 26 sources brighter than 500 mjy ,",
    "the @xmath65 was found to be 0.2% showing that , due to the effect of the image noise , @xmath65 increases as we include more fainter sources .",
    "the contribution of flux extraction error in the calculation of the accuracy of the model beam can also be seen clearly by comparing fig .",
    "[ f : hist ] and [ f : mqmu - i]the sources for which the difference between the observation and prediction is more than 0.5% are the ones with low flux and high scatter , and if we discard these sources the bar chart becomes narrower and exhibits a lower standard deviation for both stokes @xmath14 and @xmath23 .",
    "note that the standard deviation in these figures is contributed solely by the observed images as there was no additive noise in our simulation .",
    "the 18 brightest sources provide a clean model that is precise enough to predict leakage more accurately over the fwhm of the primary beam .",
    "therefore , we can now say that the errors are @xmath2 on the predicted levels of leakage of @xmath3 typically in @xmath66 of the cases , i. e. in these cases polarization leakage after calibration with the nominal lofar beam should be @xmath67 of stokes @xmath0 within the fov .",
    "we solved for dd gains toward 10 clusters using sagecal @xcite . instead of solving toward the direction of every source in the sky model , sagecal groups",
    "the sources into different clusters and solves for the gains toward the center of each cluster @xcite .",
    "however , in our case , each cluster had only one source , as solving for only the brightest sources is sufficient for our demonstration purpose .",
    "as the sky model was completely unpolarized , sagecal should subtract polarized flux at all faraday depths irrespective of instrumental or intrinsic polarization . rm profiles of the 10 sources were created both before and after sagecal and they are shown together in fig .",
    "[ f : sage ] in red and blue respectively .",
    "the figure shows that the sources with high snr , i. e. half of the sources , were subtracted to more than 80% , and the brightest two sources were subtracted to @xmath68 .",
    "local noise level in these images was on average 0.2 mjy , and the brighter sources were removed sufficiently close to the noise level .",
    "the brighter the source , the better it was removed ; the residual of the 20 mjy source was only 2.4 @xmath65 above the local noise .",
    "residuals after subtracting all the sources are mentioned on the top right corner of each panel , and we see that most residuals are @xmath69 .",
    "we have calculated the accuracy of the nominal model beam of lofar  created from the em simulations of the astron antenna group @xcite  by comparing the leakages predicted by the model beam with that of the observation of the 3c295 field .",
    "[ f : beam ] shows the model beam of a typical station ( left panel ) , and the mismatch between the beams of the two dipoles ( right panel ) , and fig .",
    "[ f : beamnu ] shows that the position of the sidelobe of the beam varies smoothly along frequency .",
    "although the mismatch of the feed - beams already shows the extent of the polarization leakage , we have quantified the polarimetric performance of the beam using the ixr@xmath15 , the mueller matrix version of the intrinsic cross - polarization ratio , a standard figure of merit for measuring the polarimetric performance of low - frequency arrays ( see , e. g. , * ? ? ?",
    "[ f : ixr2 ] and [ f : ixr1 ] show that the polarimetric performance of low - frequency aperture arrays like lofar is best near the phase center of the field and when the field is close to its culmination point . however , narrowing the field of view or filtering out the observations close to horizon result in reduced sensitivity and a balance between data filtering and calibration and modeling of the systematic errors needs to be maintained . in a15 , we showed that taking data only within the central 3 degrees decreases the effect of polarization leakage . here , from fig .",
    "[ f : ixr1 ] , we see the significant improvement of polarimetric performance close to the zenith , and further work is needed to establish a balance between the calibration and/or modeling of the dd systematic effects and the avoidance of the systematics dominated observation .",
    "note that we did not use the ixr@xmath15 directly while calculating the accuracy of the model beam , but the figures of merit we used for this purpose is very closely related to ixr@xmath15 , as explained in section [ s : fom ] .",
    "the prediction of polarization leakage in the ` eor window ' of the cylindrical ps can be made more robust in the context of lofar based on the calculations of this paper .",
    "a15 found that even without any leakage correction the simulated eor signal is higher than the rms of the leakage in a significant portion of the cylindrical ps , and this eor window extends to almost the whole instrumental @xmath5-space of lofar if 70% of the leakage could be removed . in the current paper , by comparing the leakages from stokes @xmath0 to @xmath1 , we have found that the prediction of the beam , in @xmath66 of the cases , will have an error of @xmath2 , i. e. if the predicted leakage is 1% , the actual leakage might be between 0.9% to 1.1% .",
    "therefore , if the differential beam effects are taken out perfectly using the nominal model beam of lofar , the errors in the correction will be @xmath2 , i. e. the residual leakage in stokes @xmath1 will be @xmath4 of stokes",
    "@xmath0 flux .",
    "we could calculate the accuracy of the beam model only up to the first null ; accuracy of the sidelobes of the model could not be calculated for two interconnected reasons .",
    "first , the beam model under - predicts leakage on the sidelobes to some extent which can be seen by comparing the observed ( fig .",
    "[ f : obs ] ) and the simulated ( fig .",
    "[ f : model ] ) images . in the former figure",
    ", some sources can be seen on the sidelobes , whereas in the latter all sources are within the fov ( note that the fov would also change with frequency ) .",
    "of course , the accuracy of the model beam could still be calculated , if we could quantify the under - prediction , and that s where the second reason comes in .",
    "the stokes i fluxes of the sources in the sidelobes were already very low as they were attenuated by the primary beam , and when we predicted leakage from these `` faint '' sources , the resulting leakage was even lower .",
    "so , we could not find compact sources bright enough to give rise to a detectable polarization leakage , even after the under - prediction of the beam , that would make the calculation of the accuracy possible at these distances from the phase center . due to this limitation",
    ", we claim our measurement of the accuracy of the beam model to be reliable only within the fov .",
    "however , a future paper in this series ( in preparation ) will take into account both the leakage and the accuracy of the beam model farther away from the phase center , as they are crucial for eor experiments .",
    "the result of this experiment obtained using the @xmath70 leakages should hold true even for the @xmath71 leakages , as their relationship is symmetric for both the on - axis @xcite and off - axis ( e. g. see fig .",
    "2b of a15 ) beams .",
    "therefore , we can say that the beam model used to predict the @xmath71 leakage in a15 had a 10% error , and if the leakage could be removed , this error would be one of the constituents of the residual",
    ". however , we do not know how well this subtraction can be performed given that the leakage is even below the noise level , let alone the total intensity of the diffuse foregrounds .",
    "one should be careful about the uniqueness of each field in terms of both the projection effects of the beam and the diffuse polarization structure .",
    "for example , the diffuse polarized emission in the 3c295 field is very different in both amplitude and spatial and faraday structure from that of the 3c196 field , but the projection of the beam toward these fields are not that different as they are situated at similar declinations .",
    "we used dd - calibration to remove leakages of compact sources from stokes @xmath0 to @xmath1 and found that for sources with sufficiently high snr , more than 80% of the flux could be removed and the residuals were generally very close to the local noise level .",
    "more work is needed to see how this blind correction of leakage compare with the correction using model beam .",
    "a good way to compare the modeling and dd - calibration approaches would be to test the effectiveness of aw - projection ( using , e. g. , awimager ) and sagecal in removing linear polarization leakage .",
    "however , both awimager and sagecal can remove only the leakages of compact sources from stokes @xmath0 to @xmath1 , whereas for the eor project we are interested in the leakages of diffuse emission from stokes @xmath1 to @xmath0 .",
