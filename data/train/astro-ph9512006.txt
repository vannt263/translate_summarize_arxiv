    "the medium scale anisotropy measurement ( msam ) is designed to measure variations in the 2.7  k cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr , @xcite ) to 30 @xmath0k on 05 angular scales .",
    "the telescope we are describing was used for three flights ( from 1992 through 1995 ) during the first phase of the project ( msam1 ) . for these measurements",
    ", we used a bolometric receiver with four channels at 5.6 , 9.0 , 16.5 and 22.5 @xmath1 ( 170 , 270 , 500 , and 680 ghz or 1.8 , 1.1 , 0.61 and 0.44 mm ) with approximately 1 @xmath1 bandwidth in each channel .",
    "the results of the first flight ( msam1 - 92 , 1992 june 45 ) are reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this flight observed an arc at a declination of 82 .",
    "preliminary results from the second flight ( msam1 - 94 , 1994 june 12 ) are reported by @xcite .",
    "this flight duplicated the sky coverage of the first flight in order to confirm the detection of anisotropy in the cmbr .",
    "analysis for the third flight ( msam1 - 95 , 1995 june 12 ) is in progress .",
    "this last flight doubled our sky coverage , adding an arc at a declination of 805 at roughly the same right ascensions .",
    "small improvements were made between flights , and are summarized in table  [ history ] .",
    ".hardware status summary for the msam1 flights [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      + the batteries supply 20 kw - hr . + * * * power for telemetry transmission supplied by an internal lithium battery in the cip . +",
    "[ table : summary ]    the reduction in weight of the gondola frame and jitter mechanism after msam1 - 92 is a result of switching to the cable top structure .",
    "the gondola electronics weight changes as we upgrade various subsystems .",
    "the star camera weight increased for msam1 - 94 because we flew both the old cid and new ccd cameras .",
    "we increased the battery complement for each flight in order to accommodate tests for new subsystems .",
    "the pointing performance of the msam telescope has been superb over the msam1 series of flights . the accuracy and stability of the platform is largely responsible for simplifying operational procedures , contributing significantly to the success of the project .",
    "the reliability of this 15 year old gondola was initially a concern , but by upgrading a small number of selected subsystems , it has operated almost flawlessly for the msam1 flights . at most ,",
    "1 to 2 hours of flight time was lost ( out of almost 40 hours ) due to gondola related anomalies , including difficulties with the command link that accounted for most of this loss .",
    "the optical performance after the improvement in the gondola superstructure is verified to be adequate for the measurements .",
    "however , the sensitivity of cmbr measurements to earthshine continues to be an area of concern because of the difficulty of providing adequate shielding and the concomitant validation measurements .",
    "the method we have described for mapping the sidelobe performance of the gondola is strongly recommended for all similar payloads to help alleviate some of these concerns .",
    "we would like to thank the staff of the national scientific balloon facility in palestine , texas for continuing to make ballooning a satisfying and productive experimental activity .",
    "in particular , for this project , they took on an increased burden by agreeing to provide two cips for our package so that we can carry out the measurements with a minimum of electronic changes to the gondola and radiometer .",
