    "the concept of infinity attracted the attention of people during millenniums ( see monographs @xcite and references given therein ) . to emphasize importance of the subject for modern mathematics",
    "it is sufficient to mention that the continuum hypothesis related to infinity has been included by david hilbert as the problem number one in his famous list of 23 unsolved mathematical problems ( see @xcite ) that have influenced strongly development of mathematics in the xx - th century .",
    "there exist different ways to generalize traditional arithmetic for finite numbers to the case of infinities and infinitesimals ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references given therein ) .",
    "however , the arithmetics developed for infinite numbers up to now were quite different with respect to the finite arithmetic we are used to deal with",
    ". very often they leave undetermined many operations where infinity takes part ( for example , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , sum of infinitely many items , etc . ) or use a representation of infinite numbers based on infinite sequences of finite numbers . in spite of these crucial difficulties and",
    "due to enormous importance of the concept of infinity in science , people try to introduce infinity in their work with computers .",
    "we can mention the ieee standard for binary floating - point arithmetic containing representations for @xmath2 and @xmath3 and incorporation of these notions in the interval analysis implementations .",
    "the development of the modern views on infinity and infinitesimals strangely enough was not simultaneous .",
    "the point of view on infinity accepted nowadays takes its origins from the famous ideas of georg cantor ( see @xcite ) who has shown that there exist infinite sets having different cardinalities . on the other hand ,",
    "in the early history of calculus , arguments involving infinitesimals played a pivotal role in the differential calculus developed by leibniz and newton ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the notion of an infinitesimal , however , lacked a precise mathematical definition and , in order to provide a more rigorous foundation for the calculus , infinitesimals were gradually replaced by the dalembert  cauchy concept of a limit ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the creation of a rigorous mathematical theory of infinitesimals remained an open problem until the end of the 1950s when robinson ( see @xcite ) has introduced his famous non - standard analysis approach .",
    "he has shown that non - archimedean ordered field extensions of the reals contained numbers that could serve the role of infinitesimals and their reciprocals could serve as infinitely large numbers .",
    "robinson then has derived the theory of limits , and more generally of calculus , and has found a number of important applications of his ideas in many other fields of mathematics ( see @xcite ) .    in his approach ,",
    "robinson used mathematical tools and terminology ( cardinal numbers , countable sets , continuum , one - to - one correspondence , etc . ) taking their origins from the ideas of cantor ( see @xcite ) introducing so all advantages and disadvantages of cantor s theory in non - standard analysis , as well .",
    "in fact , it is well known nowadays that while dealing with infinite sets , cantor s approach leads to some counterintuitive situations that often are called by non - mathematicians as ` paradoxes ' . for example , the set of even numbers , @xmath4 , can be put in a one - to - one correspondence with the set of all natural numbers , @xmath5 , in spite of the fact that @xmath4 is a proper subset of @xmath5 :    lccccccc & 2 , & 4 , & 6 , & 8 , & 10 , & 12 , &  + & & & & & & & + & 1 , & 2 , & 3 , & 4 & 5 , & 6 , &  +    [ 4.4.1 ] in contrast , we can observe that for finite sets , if a set @xmath6 is a proper subset of a set @xmath7 then it follows that the number of elements of the set @xmath6 is smaller than the number of elements of the set @xmath7 .",
    "another famous example that is difficult for understanding for many people is hilbert s paradox of the grand hotel having the following formulation . in a normal hotel with a finite number of rooms",
    "no more new guests can be accommodated if it is full .",
    "hilbert s grand hotel has an infinite number of rooms ( of course , the number of rooms is countable , because the rooms in the hotel are numbered ) . due to cantor ,",
    "if a new guest arrives at the hotel where every room is occupied , it is , nevertheless , possible to find a room for him .",
    "to do so , it is necessary to move the guest occupying room 1 to room 2 , the guest occupying room 2 to room 3 , etc . in such a way room 1 will be ready for the newcomer and , in spite of our assumption that there are no available rooms in the hotel , we have found one .",
    "these results are very difficult to be fully realized by anyone who is not a mathematician since in our every day experience in the world around us the part is always less than the whole and if a hotel is complete there are no places in it . in order to understand how it is possible to tackle the situations discussed above in accordance with the principle ` the part is less than the whole ' let us consider a study published in _ science _",
    "( see @xcite ) where the author describes a primitive tribe living in amazonia - pirah - that uses a very simple numeral system for counting : one , two , many . for pirah , all quantities larger than two",
    "are just ` many ' and such operations as 2 + 2 and 2 + 1 give the same result , i.e. , ` many ' .",
    "using their weak numeral system pirah are not able to see , for instance , numbers 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , to execute arithmetical operations with them , and , in general , to say anything about these numbers because in their language there are neither words nor concepts for that .",
    "moreover , the weakness of pirah s numeral system leads to such results as @xmath8 which are very familiar to us in the context of views on infinity used in the traditional calculus @xmath9 thus , the modern mathematical numeral systems allow us to distinguish a larger quantity of finite numbers with respect to pirah but give similar results when we speak about infinite numbers .",
    "the arithmetic of pirah involving the numeral ` many ' has also a clear similarity with the arithmetic proposed by cantor for his alephs .",
    "this similarity becomes even stronger if one considers another amazonian tribe  munduruk ( see @xcite )  who fail in exact arithmetic with numbers larger than 5 but are able to compare and add large approximate numbers that are far beyond their naming range .",
    "particularly , they use the words ` some , not many ' and ` many , really many ' to distinguish two types of large numbers ( in this connection think about cantor s @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) .    these observations",
    "lead us to the following idea : _ probably our difficulty in working with infinity is not connected to the nature of infinity but is a result of inadequate numeral systems used to express infinite numbers . _",
    "analogously , pirah are not able to distinguish numbers 3 and 4 not due to the nature of these numbers but due to the weakness of the numeral system that pirah use .    in this paper",
    ", we show how the introduction of a new numeral allows one to express different infinite and infinitesimal quantities . taken together with a new ( physically oriented ) methodology for mathematics ,",
    "the new numeral system can be used for theoretical and computational purposes using the infinity computer ( see @xcite ) able to work numerically with infinite and infinitesimal numbers expressed in the new numeral system .",
    "in this section , we give a brief introduction to the new methodology that can be found in a rather comprehensive form in the survey @xcite downloadable from @xcite ( see also the monograph @xcite written in a popular manner and @xcite describing the foundations of a new differential calculus ) .",
    "numerous examples of the usage of the proposed methodology can be found in @xcite .",
    "the goal of the entire operation is to propose a way of thinking that would allow us to work with finite , infinite , and infinitesimal numbers in the same way , namely , in the way we are used to deal with finite quantities in the world around us .    in order to start ,",
    "let us make some observations .",
    "as was mentioned above , foundations of the modern set theory dealing with infinity have been developed starting from the end of the xix - th century until more or less the first decades of the xx - th century .",
    "foundations of the classical analysis dealing both with infinity and infinitesimals have been developed even earlier , more than 200 years ago .",
    "the goal of its creation was to produce mathematical tools allowing one to solve problems arising in the real world in that time .",
    "as a result , classical analysis was build using the common in that time background of ideas that people had about physics ( and philosophy ) .",
    "thus , these parts of mathematics do not include numerous achievements of physics of the xx - th century .",
    "in fact , the classical analysis operates with absolute truths and ideas of relativity and quants are not reflected in it .",
    "let us give just one example to clarify this point .    in modern physics ,",
    "the ` continuity ' of an object is relative .",
    "if we observe a table by eye , then we see it as being continuous .",
    "if we use a microscope for our observation , we see that the table is discrete .",
    "this means that _ we decide _ how to see the object , as a continuous or as a discrete , by the choice of the instrument for the observation .",
    "a weak instrument  our eyes  is not able to distinguish its internal small separate parts ( e.g. , molecules ) and we see the table as a continuous object .",
    "a sufficiently strong microscope allows us to see the separate parts and the table becomes discrete but each small part now is viewed as continuous .",
    "in contrast , in traditional mathematics , any mathematical object is either continuous or discrete .",
    "for example , the same function can not be both continuous and discrete .",
    "thus , this contraposition of discrete and continuous in the traditional mathematics does not reflect properly the physical situation that we observe in practice .    note that even results of robinson made in the middle of the xx - th century have been also directed to a reformulation of the classical analysis in terms of infinitesimals and not to the creation of a new kind of analysis that would incorporate new achievements of physics .",
    "in fact , he wrote in paragraph 1.1 of his famous book @xcite : ` it is shown in this book that leibniz ' ideas can be fully vindicated and that they lead to a novel and fruitful approach to classical analysis and to many other branches of mathematics.    in order to overcome this delay with the introduction of ideas of physics of the xx - th century in mathematics , the point of view on infinities and infinitesimals ( and in general , on mathematics ) presented in this paper uses strongly relativity and interrelations holding between the object of an observation and the tool used for this observation .",
    "the latter is directly related to connections between numeral systems used to describe mathematical objects and the objects themselves .",
    "numerals that we use to write down numbers , functions , etc .",
    "are among our tools of the investigation and , as a result , they strongly influence our capabilities to study mathematical objects .",
    "this separation ( having an evident physical spirit ) of mathematical objects from tools used for their description is crucial for our study but it is used rarely in contemporary mathematics .",
    "in fact , the idea of finding an adequate ( absolutely the best ) set of axioms for one or another field of mathematics continues to be among the most attractive goals for contemporary mathematicians . usually , when it is necessary to define a concept or an object , logicians try to introduce a number of axioms _ defining _ the object .",
    "however , this way is fraught with danger because of the following reasons .",
    "first , when we describe a mathematical object or concept we are limited by the expressive capacity of the language we use to make this description .",
    "a richer language allows us to say more about the object and a weaker language  less .",
    "thus , development of the mathematical ( and not only mathematical ) languages leads to a continuous necessity of a transcription and specification of axiomatic systems .",
    "second , there is no guarantee that the chosen axiomatic system defines ` sufficiently well ' the required concept and a continuous comparison with practice is required in order to check the goodness of the accepted set of axioms .",
    "however , there can not be again any guarantee that the new version will be the last and definitive one .",
    "finally , the third limitation already mentioned above has been discovered by gdel in his two famous incompleteness theorems ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that in linguistics , the relativity of the language with respect to the world around is a well known thing .",
    "it has been formulated in the form of the sapir  whorf thesis ( see  @xcite ) also known as the ` linguistic relativity thesis ' .",
    "as becomes clear from its name , the thesis does not accept the idea of the universality of language and postulates that the nature of a particular language influences the thought of its speakers .",
    "the thesis challenges the possibility of perfectly representing the world with language , because it implies that the mechanisms of any language condition the thoughts of its speakers .",
    "thus , our point of view on axiomatic systems is different .",
    "it is significantly more applied and less ambitious and is related only to utilitarian necessities to make calculations . in contrast to the modern mathematical fashion that tries to make all axiomatic systems more and more precise ( decreasing so degrees of freedom of the studied part of mathematics ) , we just define a set of general rules describing how practical computations should be executed leaving so as much space as possible for further , dictated by practice , changes and developments of the introduced mathematical language . speaking metaphorically , we prefer to make a hammer and to use it instead of describing what is a hammer and how it works .",
    "since our point of view on the mathematical world is significantly more physical and more applied than the traditional one , it becomes necessary to clarify it better .",
    "let us formulate three methodological postulates that will guide our further study and will show where our positions are different with respect to the tradition .",
    "traditionally , when mathematicians deal with infinite objects ( sets or processes ) it is supposed that human beings are able to execute certain operations infinitely many times ( e.g. , see ( [ 4.4.1 ] ) ) .",
    "however , since we live in a finite world and all human beings and/or computers are forced to finish operations that they have started , this supposition is not adopted .    *",
    "postulate 1 .",
    "* _ there exist infinite and infinitesimal objects but human beings and machines are able to execute only a finite number of operations .",
    "_    due to this postulate , we accept a priori that we shall never be able to give a complete description of infinite processes and sets due to our finite capabilities .    the second postulate is adopted following the way of reasoning used in natural sciences where researchers use tools to describe the object of their study and the used instrument influences the results of the observations .",
    "when a physicist uses a weak lens @xmath6 and sees two black dots in his / her microscope he / she does not say : the object of the observation _ is _ two black dots . the physicist is obliged to say : the lens used in the microscope allows us to see two black dots and it is not possible to say anything more about the nature of the object of the observation until we change the instrument - the lens or the microscope itself - by a more precise one .",
    "suppose that he / she changes the lens and uses a stronger lens @xmath7 and is able to observe that the object of the observation is viewed as ten ( smaller ) black dots .",
    "thus , we have two different answers : ( i ) the object is viewed as two dots if the lens @xmath6 is used ; ( ii ) the object is viewed as ten dots by applying the lens @xmath7 . which of the answers is correct ? both .",
    "both answers are correct but with the different accuracies that depend on the lens used for the observation .",
    "the same happens in mathematics studying natural phenomena , numbers , and objects that can be constructed by using numbers .",
    "numeral systems used to express numbers are among the instruments of observations used by mathematicians .",
    "the usage of powerful numeral systems gives the possibility to obtain more precise results in mathematics in the same way as usage of a good microscope gives the possibility of obtaining more precise results in physics .",
    "however , the capabilities of the tools will be always limited due to postulate 1 ( we are able to write down only a finite number of symbols when we wish to describe a mathematical object ) and due to postulate  2 we shall never tell , * what is * , for example , a number but shall just observe it through numerals expressible in a chosen numeral system .",
    "* postulate 2 . *",
    "_ we shall not tell * what are * the mathematical objects we deal with ; we just shall construct more powerful tools that will allow us to improve our capacities to observe and to describe properties of mathematical objects .",
    "_    this means that mathematical results are not absolute , they depend on mathematical languages used to formulate them , i.e. , there always exists an accuracy of the description of a mathematical result , fact , object , etc . for instance , the result of pirah @xmath12 ` many ' is not wrong , it is just inaccurate .",
    "the introduction of a stronger tool ( in this case , a numeral system that contains a numeral for a representation of the number four ) allows us to have a more precise answer .",
    "it is necessary to comment upon another important aspect of the distinction between a mathematical object and a mathematical tool used to observe this object .",
    "the postulates 1 and 2 impose us to think always about _ the possibility to execute _ a mathematical operation by applying a numeral system .",
    "they tell us that there always exist situations where we are not able to express the result of an operation .",
    "let us consider , for example , the operation of construction of the successive element widely used in number and set theories . in the traditional mathematics , the aspect whether this operation can be executed",
    "is not taken into consideration , it is supposed that it is always possible to execute the operation @xmath13 starting from any integer @xmath14 .",
    "thus , there is no any distinction between the existence of the number @xmath15 and the possibility to execute the operation @xmath16 and to express its result , i.e. to have a numeral that can express @xmath15 .",
    "postulates 1 and 2 emphasize this distinction and tell us that : ( i )   in order to execute the operation it is necessary to have a numeral system allowing one to express both numbers , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; ( ii )  for any numeral system there always exists a number @xmath15 that can not be expressed in it .",
    "for instance , for pirah @xmath17 , for munduruk @xmath18 .",
    "even for modern powerful numeral systems there exist such a number @xmath15 ( for instance , nobody is able to write down a numeral in the decimal positional system having @xmath19 digits ) .",
    "hereinafter we shall always emphasize the triad ",
    "researcher , object of the investigation , and tools used to observe the object  in various mathematical and computational contexts paying a special attention to the accuracy of the obtained results .",
    "particularly , postulate  2 means that , from our point of view , axiomatic systems _ do not define _ mathematical objects but just determine formal rules for operating with certain numerals reflecting some properties of the studied mathematical objects using a certain mathematical language @xmath20 .",
    "we are aware that the chosen language @xmath20 has its accuracy and there always can exist a richer language @xmath21 that would allow us to describe the studied object better . due to postulate  1 , any language has a limited expressibility , in particular , there always exist situations where the accuracy of the answers expressible in this language is not sufficient .",
    "such situations lead to ` paradoxes ' showing the boundaries of the applicability of a language ( theory , concept , etc . )",
    "let us return again to pirah and illustrate this point by using their answers @xmath22 ` many ' and @xmath12 ` many ' . from these two identities",
    "one can obtain the result @xmath23 being a ` paradox ' . from our point of view , this situation just determines the boundaries of the applicability of their numeral system .",
    "finally , we adopt the principle of greeks mentioned above as the third postulate .",
    "* postulate 3 . * _ the principle ` the part is less than the whole ' is applied to all numbers ( finite , infinite , and infinitesimal ) and to all sets and processes ( finite and infinite ) .",
    "_    due to this declared applied statement , it becomes clear that the subject of this paper is out of cantor s approach and , as a consequence , out of non - standard analysis of robinson .",
    "such concepts as bijection , numerable and continuum sets , cardinal and ordinal numbers can not be used in this paper because they belong to the theory working with different assumptions .",
    "however , the approach used here does not contradict cantor and robinson .",
    "it can be viewed just as a more strong lens of a mathematical microscope that allows one to distinguish more objects and to work with them .",
    "in @xcite , a new numeral system has been developed in accordance with methodological postulates  13 .",
    "it gives a possibility to execute numerical computations not only with finite numbers but also with infinite and infinitesimal ones .",
    "the main idea consists of the possibility to measure infinite and infinitesimal quantities by different ( infinite , finite , and infinitesimal ) units of measure .",
    "a new infinite unit of measure has been introduced for this purpose as the number of elements of the set @xmath5 of natural numbers .",
    "the new number is called _ grossone _ and is expressed by the numeral 1 .",
    "it is necessary to stress immediately that 1 is neither cantor s @xmath10 nor @xmath24 . particularly , it has both cardinal and ordinal properties as usual finite natural numbers ( see @xcite ) .",
    "note also that since 1 , on the one hand , and @xmath10 ( and @xmath24 ) , on the other hand , belong to different mathematical languages working with different theoretical assumptions , they can not be used together .",
    "analogously , it is not possible to use together piraha s ` many ' and the modern numeral 4 .    formally , grossone is introduced as a new number by describing its properties postulated by the _ infinite unit axiom _ ( iua ) ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this axiom is added to axioms for real numbers similarly to addition of the axiom determining zero to axioms of natural numbers when integer numbers are introduced .",
    "it is important to emphasize that we speak about axioms for real numbers in sense of postulate  2 , i.e. , axioms do not define real numbers , they just define formal rules of operations with numerals in given numeral systems ( tools of the observation ) reflecting so certain ( not all ) properties of the object of the observation , i.e. , properties of real numbers .",
    "inasmuch as it has been postulated that grossone is a number , all other axioms for numbers hold for it , too . particularly , associative and commutative properties of multiplication and addition , distributive property of multiplication over addition , existence of inverse elements with respect to addition and multiplication hold for grossone as for finite numbers .",
    "this means that the following relations hold for grossone , as for any other number 0 1 = 1 0 = 0 , 1 - 1= 0 , = 1 , 1 ^ 0=1 , 1^=1 , 0^=0 . [ 3.2.1 ] the introduction of the new numeral allows us to use it for construction of various new numerals expressing infinite and infinitesimal numbers and to operate with them as with usual finite constants . as a consequence",
    ", the numeral @xmath25 is excluded from our new mathematical language ( together with numerals @xmath26 and @xmath24 ) .",
    "in fact , since we are able now to express explicitly different infinite numbers , records of the type @xmath27 become a kind of @xmath28 , i.e. , they are not sufficiently precise .",
    "it becomes necessary not only to say that @xmath29 goes to infinity , it is necessary to indicate to which point in infinity ( e.g. , @xmath30 , etc . )",
    "we want to sum up .",
    "note that for sums having a finite number of items the situation is the same : it is not sufficient to say that the number of items in the sum is finite , it is necessary to indicate explicitly the number of items in the sum .",
    "the appearance of new numerals expressing infinite and infinitesimal numbers gives us a lot of new possibilities .",
    "for example , it becomes possible to develop a differential calculus ( see @xcite ) for functions that can assume finite , infinite , and infinitesimal values and can be defined over finite , infinite , and infinitesimal domains avoiding indeterminate forms and divergences ( all these concepts just do not appear in the new calculus ) .",
    "this approach allows us to work with derivatives and integrals that can assume not only finite but infinite and infinitesimal values , as well .",
    "infinite and infinitesimal numbers are not auxiliary entities in the new calculus , they are full members in it and can be used in the same way as finite constants .",
    "let us comment upon the nature of grossone and give some examples illustrating its usage and , in particular , its direct links with infinite sets .",
    "[ e1_lagrange ] grossone has been introduced as the number of elements of the set @xmath5 of natural numbers . as a consequence , similarly to the set a=\\{1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 } [ 4.1.deriva_0 ] consisting of 5 natural numbers where 5 is the largest number in @xmath6 ,",
    "1 is the largest number . ] in @xmath5 and @xmath31 analogously to the fact that 5 belongs to @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the set , @xmath5 , of natural numbers can be written in the form = \\ { 1,2 , ",

    "[ 4.1.deriva_1 ] similarly , pirah are not able to see finite numbers larger than 2 using their weak numeral system but these numbers are visible if one uses a more powerful numeral system . due to postulate  2 , the same object of observation  the set @xmath5 ",
    "can be observed by different instruments  numeral systems  with different accuracies allowing one to express more or less natural numbers .",
    "@xmath32    this example illustrates also the fact that when we speak about sets ( finite or infinite ) it is necessary to take care about tools used to describe a set ( remember postulate  2 ) . in order to introduce a set , it is necessary to have a language ( e.g. , a numeral system ) allowing us to describe its elements and to express the number of the elements in the set .",
    "for instance , the set @xmath6 from ( [ 4.1.deriva_0 ] ) can not be defined using the mathematical language of pirah .",
    "analogously , the words ` the set of all finite numbers ' do not define a set completely from our point of view , as well .",
    "it is always necessary to specify which instruments are used to describe ( and to observe ) the required set and , as a consequence , to speak about ` the set of all finite numbers expressible in a fixed numeral system ' . for instance , for pirah ` the set of all finite numbers ' is the set @xmath33 and for munduruk ` the set of all finite numbers ' is the set @xmath6 from ( [ 4.1.deriva_0 ] ) .",
    "as it happens in physics , the instrument used for an observation bounds the possibility of the observation .",

    "we can speak about the set of _ extended natural numbers _ ( including @xmath5 as a proper subset ) indicated as @xmath50 where = \\ { 1,2 ,  , 1 - 1 , 1 , 1 + 1 , 1 + 2 , 1 + 3 ,  , 1 ^ 2 - 1 , 1 ^ 2 .",

    "in fact , since @xmath54 , it is extended natural ( see ( [ 4.2.2 ] ) ) .",

    "finally , the guest from room 1 should be moved to room 1 + 1 but the hotel has only 1 rooms . as a result , the person from the last room should leave the hotel .",
    "thus , when the hotel is full , no more new guests can be accommodated in it if one wants that all guests living in the hotel before the arrival of the newcomer remain inside .",
    "this result corresponds perfectly to postulate  3 and to the situation taking place in hotels with a finite number of rooms .",
    "let us consider now the issue regarding a more systematic way to produce numerals including 1 .",

    "numbers @xmath65 in ( [ 3.13 ] ) are sorted in the decreasing order with @xmath66 @xmath67 they are called _ grosspowers _ and they themselves can be written in the form ( [ 3.13 ] ) . in the record ( [ 3.13 ] ) , we write @xmath64 explicitly because in the new numeral positional system the number @xmath29 in general is not equal to the grosspower @xmath68 .",
    "this gives the possibility to write down numerals without indicating grossdigits equal to zero .",
    "the term having @xmath69 represents the finite part of @xmath61 because , due to ( [ 3.2.1 ] ) , we have @xmath70 .",
    "the terms having finite positive grosspowers represent the simplest infinite parts of @xmath61 .",
    "analogously , terms having negative finite grosspowers represent the simplest infinitesimal parts of @xmath61 .",

    "it is the inverse element with respect to multiplication for 1 : 1 ^ -11=11 ^ -1=1 .",
    "[ 3.15.1 ] note that all infinitesimals are not equal to zero .",
    "particularly , @xmath72 because it is a result of division of two positive numbers .",
    "all of the numbers introduced above can be grosspowers , as well , giving thus a possibility to have various combinations of quantities and to construct terms having a more complex structure .",
    "[ e4_lagrange ] in this example , it is shown how to write down numerals in the new positional numeral system and how the value of the number is calculated : @xmath73 @xmath74 the number @xmath75 above has two infinite parts of the type @xmath76 and @xmath77 , a finite part corresponding to @xmath78 , and two infinitesimal parts of the type @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",

    "as was already mentioned , the numeral @xmath25 is excluded from our new mathematical language since we are able now to express explicitly different infinite numbers .",
    "in fact , records of the type @xmath27 become a kind of @xmath28 and are not sufficiently precise . in order to define a sum ( independently on the fact whether the number of items in it is finite or infinite )",
    ", it is necessary to indicate explicitly how many items we want to sum up . if the number of items in a sum is infinite then , as it happens for the finite case , different numbers of items in a sum lead to different answers ( that can be infinite , finite , or infinitesimal ) .",
    "let us give just two examples ( see @xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "we start from the famous series @xmath81 in literature , there exist many approaches giving different answers regarding the value of this series ( see @xcite ) .",
    "all of them use various notions of average to calculate the series .",
    "however , the notions of the sum and of an average are two different things . in our approach",
    ", we do not use the notion of series and do not appeal to an average .",
    "we indicate explicitly the number of items , @xmath15 , in the sum ( where @xmath15 can be finite or infinite ) and calculate it directly : @xmath82 and it is not important is the number @xmath15 finite or infinite .",
    "for example , for @xmath83 we have @xmath84 and for @xmath85 we obtain @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath32    it is important to emphasize that , as it happens in the case of the finite number of items in a sum , the obtained answers do not depend on the way the items in the entire sum are re - arranged .",
    "in fact , if we know the exact infinite number of items in the sum and the order of alternating the signs is clearly defined , we know also the exact number of positive and negative items in the sum .",
    "let us illustrate this point by supposing , for instance , that we want to re - arrange the items in the sum @xmath87 in the following way @xmath88 however , we know that the sum has @xmath89 items and the number @xmath89 is even .",
    "this means that in the sum there are @xmath90 positive and @xmath90 negative items . as a result",
    ", the re - arrangement considered above can continue only until the positive items present in the sum will not finish and then it will be necessary to continue to add only negative numbers .",
    "more precisely , we have @xmath91 where the result of the first part in this re - arrangement is calculated as @xmath92 and the result of the second part is equal to @xmath93 .    [ e6_lagrange ]",

    "[ riemann15 ] obviously , if we change the number of items , @xmath15 , then , as it happens in the finite case , the results of summation will also change .",
    "for instance , it follows @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "@xmath32    analogously to the passage from series to sums considered above , we are able now to move from limits of expressions to the exact evaluation of these expressions at points ( finite , infinite or infinitesimal ) of our interest .",
    "moreover , we can calculate an expression @xmath100 independently on the fact of the existence of the limit .",
    "we are able to change our way of thinking in sense that instead of formulating problems in terms of limits by asking ` what does it happen when @xmath101 _ tends _ to @xmath25 ? '",
    "we can ask ` what does it happen at different points of infinity ? '",
    "thus , limits are substituted by computation , at different points @xmath101 , of precise results @xmath100 that can assume infinite , finite or infinitesimal values and can be evaluated also in the cases where limits do not exist . as a rule ,",
    "the calculated values are different for different infinite , finite , or infinitesimal values of @xmath101 .",
    "note that the possibility of the direct evaluation of expressions is very important ( in particular , for automatic computations ) because it eliminates indeterminate forms from the practice of computations .",
    "for instance , in the traditional language if for a finite @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 then @xmath105 is an indeterminate form . in the new language , this means that for any @xmath106 where @xmath107 is infinitesimal , the value @xmath108 is also infinitesimal and for any infinite @xmath109 it follows that @xmath110 is also infinite . in order to be able to execute computations ,",
    "we should behave ourselves as we are used to do in the finite case .",
    "namely , it is necessary to choose @xmath107 and @xmath109 , to evaluate @xmath108 and @xmath110 .",
    "after we have performed these operations it becomes possible to execute multiplication @xmath111 and to obtain the corresponding result that can be infinite , finite or infinitesimal in dependence of the values of @xmath107 and @xmath109 and the form of expressions @xmath100 and @xmath110 .",
    "it is possible also to execute other operations with infinitesimals and infinities making questions with respect to @xmath108 and @xmath110 that could not even be formulated using the traditional language using limits .",
    "for instance , we can ask about the result of the following expression f(a+z_2 ) ( -1.25 g(y_2)^3 ) [ lagrange_1 ] for two different infinitesimals @xmath112 and two different infinite values @xmath113 .    [ e7_lagrange ]",
    "let us consider an illustration regarding computation of the product @xmath111 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we take @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 if we want to calculate the product at points @xmath117 and @xmath118 then it follows @xmath119 analogously , @xmath117 and @xmath120 give @xmath121 and for @xmath122 and @xmath118 we obtain @xmath123 we end this example by calculating the result of the expression ( [ lagrange_1 ] ) for @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129    we conclude the paper by showing how the distinction between mathematical objects and tools of their observation helps us in solving probabilistic questions and introduces the ideas of relativity in mathematics . in particular , we intend to show that the new approach allows us to distinguish the impossible event having the probability equal to zero ( i.e. , @xmath130 ) from those events that from the traditional point of view have the probability equal to zero but can occur .",
    "let us consider the problem presented in fig .",
    "[ big_paper2 ] from the point of view of the traditional probability theory .",
    "we start to rotate a disk having radius @xmath131 with the point @xmath6 marked at its border and we would like to know the probability @xmath132 of the following event @xmath133 : the disk stops in such a way that the point @xmath6 will be exactly in front of the arrow fixed at the wall . since the point @xmath6 is an entity that has no extent , it is calculated by considering the following limit @xmath134 where @xmath135 is an arc of the circumference containing @xmath6 and @xmath136 is its length",
    "however , the point @xmath6 can stop in front of the arrow , i.e. , this event is not impossible and its probability should be strictly greater than zero , i.e. , @xmath137 . obviously , this example is a particular manifestation of the general fact that , if @xmath138 is any continuous random value and @xmath102 is any real number then @xmath139 . while for a discrete random variable one could say that an event with probability zero is impossible , this can not be said in the terms of the traditional probability theory for any continuous random variable .",
    "let us see what we can say with respect to this problem by using the new methodology .",
    "the problem under consideration deals with points located on the circumference @xmath61 of the disk .",
    "thus , we need a definition of the term ` point ' and mathematical tools allowing us to indicate a point on the circumference . if we accept ( as is usually done in modern mathematics ) that a _ point _ is determined by a numeral @xmath101 called the _ coordinate of the point _ where @xmath140 and @xmath141 is a set of numerals , then we can indicate the point by its coordinate @xmath101 and are able to execute required calculations .",
    "the choice of the numeral system @xmath141 defines both the kind of numerals expressible in this system and the quantity ( finite or infinite ) of these numerals ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) . as a consequence , we are not able to work with those points which coordinates are not expressible in the chosen numeral system @xmath141 ( recall postulate  2 ) .",
    "different numeral systems can be chosen to express coordinates of the points in dependence on the precision level we want to obtain . in some sense ,",
    "the situation with counting points is similar to the work with a microscope : we decide the level of the precision we need and obtain a result dependent on the chosen level .",
    "if we need a more precise or a more rough answer , we change the level of the accuracy of our microscope . in the moment when we have",
    "have decided which lens ( numeral system ) we put in the microscope we decide which objects ( points , arcs , etc . )",
    "we are able to observe , to measure , and to work with .",
    "the formalization of the concept ` point ' introduced above allows us to execute more accurate computations having , as it always happens in any process of the measurement , their own accuracy .",
    "suppose that we have chosen a numeral system @xmath141 allowing one to observe @xmath142 points on the circumference .",
    "definition of the notion _ point _ allows us to define elementary events in our experiment as follows : the disk has stopped and the arrow indicates a point . as a consequence , we obtain that the number , @xmath143 , of all possible elementary events , @xmath144 , in our experiment is equal to @xmath142 where @xmath145 is the sample space of our experiment .",
    "if our disk is well balanced , all elementary events are equiprobable and , therefore , they have the same probability equal to @xmath146 and the accuracy of any further computation with this probabilistic model will be equal to @xmath146 .",
    "thus , we can calculate @xmath132 directly by subdividing the number , @xmath147 , of favorable elementary events by the number , @xmath148 , of all possible events .",
    "for example , if we use numerals of the type @xmath149 then @xmath150 and , since the number of the points is infinite and the length of the circumference is finite , our points are infinitesimally close , i.e. , the probabilistic model is continuous .",
    "the chosen numerals define the accuracy of the model and do not allow us to answer to questions regarding objects having an extension on the circumference that is less than @xmath151 .",
    "the number @xmath147 depends on our decision about how many numerals we want to use to represent the point @xmath6 .",
    "if we decide that the point  @xmath6 on the circumference is represented by @xmath152 numerals we obtain @xmath153 where the number @xmath154 is infinitesimal if @xmath152 is finite . note",
    "that this representation is very interesting also from the point of view of distinguishing the notions ` point ' and ` arc ' .",
    "when @xmath152 is finite than we deal with a point , when @xmath152 is infinite we deal with an arc .    in the case",
    "we need the probabilistic model with a higher accuracy , we can choose , for instance , numerals of the type @xmath155 for expressing points on the circumference . in this way",
    "we also obtain a continuous model with the order that is higher than in the previous case .",
    "it follows @xmath156 and for a finite @xmath152 we obtain the infinitesimal probability @xmath157 .",
    "in contrast , if we need a rough probabilistic model and decide to work with a finite number , @xmath142 , of points on the circumference , then we have the discrete model . in this case , the probability @xmath132 will be finite , and the model does not allow us to answer to questions regarding objects having an extension on the circumference that is less than  @xmath158 .",
    "as we have shown by the example above , in our approach , for both cases , the discrete and the continuous one , only the impossible event has the probability equal to zero .",
    "all other events have positive probabilities that can be finite or infinitesimal in dependence of the accuracy of the chosen probabilistic model .",
    "thus , the obtained probabilities are not absolute , i.e. , there is again a straight analogy with physics where results of the observation have a precision determined by the used instrument .",
    "moreover , the new approach allows us to look at the same mathematical object ( like it happens in physics for physical objects ) as continuous or discrete in dependence on the chosen instrument of the observation ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion related to this issue ) .",
