    "we have formulated a _ statistical no - signaling _ principle which dictates that no information can pass through a disconnected channel . applied to an infinite limit of the van  dam protocol , this principle is equivalent to the quantum bound on nonlocality .",
    "we may view this fact as an example of asymptotic theory in statistics , in which an asymptotic limit allows us to discern statistical properties that are unavailable for a finite number of samples .",
    "statistical no - signaling is different from the notion of _ no - signaling _ in the sense of non - signaling theories ( ns  boxes ) .",
    "no - signaling pertains to a single pair of boxes , whereas statistical no - signaling is used as a condition on the limit of an iterative construction involving infinitely many boxes .",
    "taking statistical no - signaling instead of what is traditionally called ` no - signaling ' as our no - signaling condition , we recover the idea that quantum  mechanics is indeed the most general nonlocal non - signaling theory .",
    "shimony @xcite and aharonov @xcite independently suggested that a quantum theory may perhaps be based on two axioms , nonlocality and relativistic  causality ( no - signaling ) .",
    "aharonov ( unpublished ) also observed that these two axioms , which seem to contradict one another , can be reconciled using _",
    "uncertainty_. this idea was virtually abandoned for many years following the discovery of superquantum theories which satisfy both axioms .",
    "but statistical no - signaling reveals a sense in which this original idea holds true .",
    "when the number of nonlocal resources increases to infinity , stronger - than - quantum nonlocal theories fail to satisfy statistical no - signaling .",
    "these superquantum theories approach a signaling limit where bob can recover alice s message with complete certainty even though the channel between alice and bob is disconnected .",
    "quantum  nonlocality obeys statistical no - signaling and thus permits only bounded uncertainty ( pure randomness ) , @xmath121 , or complete uncertainty , @xmath122 , in the limit .",
    "the statistical no - signaling condition is stronger than previously  identified principle of information  causality  @xcite . violation of statistical no - signaling implies violation of information  causality whereas the converse implication is false .",
    "this is evident in the derivation of information  causality in that paper , where the expression of the fisher  information in in the @xmath118 case appears as equation ( 23 ) therein .",

    "<S> must this inequality also hold for any future theory which might someday supercede quantum  mechanics @xcite ? </S>",
    "<S> we are led to the following question :    question : :    can we find a plausible physical principle , independent of    quantum  mechanics , which is necessary and sufficient to guarantee that    @xmath16 ?    </S>",
    "<S> the search for such a principle has a history of about 20 years . </S>",
    "<S> it was initially expected that the physical principle of relativistic  causality ( no - signaling ) itself restricts the strength of nonlocality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but then it was discovered that no - signaling theories may exist for which @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this led to the device - independent formalism of _ no - signaling ( ns)boxes _  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , maximum violation of the bell  chsh inequality is achieved by _ popescu  rohrlich ( pr)boxes _ which are consistent with relativistic  causality . </S>",
    "<S> why then , after all , does nature not permit to be violated ( as far as we know ) ? </S>",
    "<S> several suggestions have been made . </S>",
    "<S> superquantum correlations lead to violations of the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xcite , which is another seemingly purely quantum result . </S>",
    "<S> pr  boxes would allow distributed computation to be performed with only one bit of communication @xcite , which looks unlikely but does nt violate any known physical law . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , in stronger - than - quantum nonlocal theories some computations exceed reasonable performance limits  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the principle of _ information  causality _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite shows that no sensible measure of mutual information exists between pairs of systems in superquantum nonlocal theories . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it was shown that superquantum nonlocality does not permit classical physics to emerge in the limit of infinitely many microscopic systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> of these , only information  causality and macroscopic  locality give necessary conditions for the quantum  bound and neither is known to be sufficient  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus these conditions do not single out quantum mechanics from amongst all possible nonlocal theories , as pointed out in  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose the following statement as a physical principle :    statistical no - signaling : :    no information can pass through a channel whose output is independent    of its input .    in this report </S>",
    "<S> we formulate a consequence of statistical no - signaling that is equivalent to , providing a sought - for conceptual explanation for the quantum bound on nonlocality . </S>",
    "<S> the novelty of our approach is our use of statistical methods . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath18 be a bernoulli random variable held by alice , which serves as our _ information source_. we imagine @xmath19 $ ] as encoding a message , perhaps in the digits of its binary expansion . </S>",

    "<S> [ sec : vandam ] we construct such channels and show that @xmath11 may be viewed as the correlation between their inputs and outputs .    </S>",
    "<S> the _ fisher information _ @xmath26 represents the maximum information about @xmath27 that bob may have received by way of the above protocol . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath28 then bob knows @xmath27 ` on the nose ' , while if @xmath29 then bob has received no information about @xmath27 at all .    </S>",
    "<S> consequence of statistical no - signaling : :    given the above setting , if @xmath22 and    @xmath25 are independent random variables then    @xmath30 .    </S>",
    "<S> when the number of samples is finite , the fisher information for a disconnected channel obviously vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> but when there are infinitely many samples it may happen that @xmath31 . indeed , we will construct a disconnected channel for which @xmath31 using superquantum ns  boxes . </S>",
    "<S> it is in this way that statistical no - signalling will imply that superquantum ns  </S>",
    "<S> boxes are non - physical and therefore that the quantum bound on nonlocality is indeed fundamental . </S>",

    "<S> the correlations between alice s boxes and bob s boxes are governed by the bell  chsh correlation @xmath93 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the process described above is called _ random access coding _ or _ oblivious transfer _ , and it defines a channel from @xmath22 to @xmath25 ( see supplementary  [ sec : vandam ] and figure  [ fig : rac ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> assume first that @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> a short calculation in supplementaries  [ sec : vandam ] and [ sec : capacity ] will reveal the following properties in the @xmath95 limit :    * random variables @xmath22 and @xmath25 are independent . * as for the fisher  information : @xmath96    statistical no - signaling rules out the first case , from which we deduce that @xmath97 , that is the quantum limit on nonlocality  .    </S>",
    "<S> the conceptual explanation for why the channel becomes disconnected as @xmath98 is that the only information which passes from alice to bob in the van  dam protocol is @xmath88 which is a communication bottleneck . </S>",
