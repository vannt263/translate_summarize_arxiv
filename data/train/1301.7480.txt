    "cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) are close binary systems in which a white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star which overflows its roche lobe .",
    "very few cvs have orbital periods below the so - called `` period minimum , '' which has been observed to be @xmath078  minutes @xcite . as @xcite explain , the period minimum is a consequence of emerging electron degeneracy in the donor star and the strong , inverse relationship between donor - star density and a cv s orbital period .",
    "when a non - degenerate donor sheds some of its mass , its density increases , prompting the cv s orbital period to shrink . a degenerate donor , however , has exactly the opposite response to mass loss , so once the secondary star becomes degenerate , it will have reached its maximum density  and thus the shortest orbital period possible for the system .",
    "thereafter , the cv will evolve toward a longer orbital period , its period having  bounced \" off the minimum .    nevertheless , a handful of cvs , some with orbital periods as short as several minutes , defy the 78-minute period minimum .",
    "almost every cv in this category is an am  cvn - type system , featuring a rich helium spectrum lacking even the slightest hint of hydrogen .",
    "helium - enhanced stars are denser than their hydrogen - dominated counterparts , so they adhere to a shorter period minimum @xcite .",
    "there are three theoretical avenues of formation for these unusual stars @xcite .",
    "first , the distance between two detached white dwarfs might decrease as a result of gravitational radiation , causing the lower - mass companion to eventually overflow its roche lobe .",
    "second , a low - mass , helium - fusing star in an interacting binary might lose so much mass that its core would be unable to sustain the necessary temperature and pressure for continued helium fusion , producing a semi - degenerate core .",
    "third , if mass transfer were to commence near the end of the main - sequence lifetime of the donor star , the secondary star would shed its hydrogen envelope , exposing the relatively dense , hydrogen - deficient interior of the star .",
    "spectroscopically , the helium - to - hydrogen ratio would gradually increase as the system continued to evolve .",
    "unlike the first two models , the evolved - main - sequence - donor model predicts the presence of some hydrogen in the donor star @xcite .",
    "oddly , a few cvs are below the period minimum , but with strong hydrogen lines in their spectra , they can not be am  cvn stars . instead , these stars belong to the su  uma sequence of cvs ; consequently , while in outburst , they display superhumps  periodic photometric oscillations attributed to a precessing , eccentric accretion disk  whose period is within several percent of the orbital period .",
    "however , the secondary stars in the sub - period - minimum su  uma systems are not the garden - variety donor stars found in most cvs above the minimum . in two of these cvs ,",
    "ei psc @xcite and v485 cen @xcite , the he  i 667.8-nm - to - h@xmath1 ratio is elevated with respect to cvs above the period minimum , and the secondary star is plainly visible in optical and near - infrared spectra .",
    "a third system below the minimum , sdss j150722.30 + 523039.8 , has very weak helium lines and shows no trace of the donor , leading @xcite to conclude that the secondary is a brown dwarf .",
    "another sub - period - minimum star , css 100603:112253 - 111037 ( hereinafter , css  100603 ) , is a hybrid of these three systems . like ei  psc and v485  cen",

    "on 2012 april 22 , the catalina sky survey @xcite detected an outburst of css  120422:111127 + 571239  ( hereinafter , css  120422 ) , a previously undiscovered cv . with a peak observed brightness of v @xmath2 15.4 , the system brightened by at least 4 magnitudes from its typical brightness in the catalina data .",

    "a quiescent accretion disk will usually be cooler than the wd , causing the overall flux of the system to be redder , but in a system with a low rate of mass transfer , the disk will be relatively tenuous and dim , enabling the wd s blue continuum to overwhelm the disk s meager contribution .",

    "likewise , on the following night , an expected peak in the light curve did not occur and was followed instead by a comparatively gentle decrease in flux . in the very next cycle , however , the peak returned , and the post - peak dip had a different shape . clearly , the source of the orbital modulation , which we believe to be tidally - induced spiral structure in the outer disk ( see section  [ spirals ] ) , is capable of significant variability on timescales of less than one hour .",

    "although the exact physical processes underlying this @xmath27-@xmath23 correlation are unclear , it provides approximate estimates of @xmath23 using just the orbital and superhump periods , making it a particularly useful technique for analyzing a system whose mass ratio can not be ascertained by other means . relying upon a detailed survey of superhumps ,",
    "@xcite updated patterson s original formula slightly , obtaining @xmath28 where @xmath27 is determined using the shortest p@xmath29 rather than the mean p@xmath29 . applying the quadratic formula and rejecting the negative root ( to ensure a positive value of @xmath23 ) yields a more convenient , explicit function : @xmath30 using this formula , a p@xmath29 of 55.971  minutes @xcite , and our p@xmath31 of 55.36  minutes , we obtain @xmath32 . however , since the @xmath27-@xmath23 relation in other systems is only approximate , the uncertainty for @xmath23 is probably greatly underestimated .",

    "the double - peaked balmer and he  i emission lines in the lbt spectra exhibit a radial - velocity variation over the photometric period ( figure  [ halpha_vel ] ) .",
    "in contrast to many am  cvn stars and css  100603 , these lines do not show stationary , central peaks in our trailed spectra , but there is an ` s - wave ' present between the peaks of each of these lines .",
    "the single - peaked he  ii emission shows a particularly prominent s - wave for approximately half of the orbit , a feature which we attribute to the bright spot created by the stream - disk collision .",
    "the non - appearance of the he  ii line for over half of the orbit implies that the inclination of the system is sufficiently high that the bright spot rotates behind the disk as seen from earth .",

    "r10 cm      to avoid influencing the measurement of radial velocity variations with changes in the line shapes , we estimated the line velocities using the method described by @xcite .",

    "the wavelength of the gaussians are shifted until the difference in flux measured by the two functions is zero .",

    "since an accretion disk s emission is often asymmetric , techniques which rely upon a measurement of the wings of a spectral line will frequently produce inaccurate radial velocities for the wd ( e.g. appendix a.2 in * ? ? ?",

    "several attributes of css  120422  distinguish it from most other sub - period - minimum systems with detectable hydrogen .",
    "for example ,",
    "ei  psc and v485  cen both contain prominent secondary stars which are relatively easy to detect spectroscopically .",
    "the prevailing explanation for the secondary stars in these two systems is that they are evolved stars which have shed their outer envelopes .",
    "both are abnormally luminous for such short orbital periods @xcite . while ei  psc and v485  cen both exhibit helium enrichment like css  120422 , the non - detection of the donor in css  120422  out to 950  nm suggests that it is cool and dim , in agreement with the system s very low mass ratio .",
    "while the combination of an invisible donor and a sub - minimum period could be the signature of a brown - dwarf secondary , the greatly elevated levels of helium in css  120422  do not support this scenario .",
    "brown dwarfs , by definition , lack the mass necessary to enter the main sequence , so they should not be particularly rich in helium .",
    "thus , the helium enhancement in ei  psc and v485  cen is inconsistent with the presence of brown - dwarf donors in those systems @xcite ; indeed , in the spectra of brown - dwarf cvs , the he  i emission is quite subdued ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "although the he  i / h@xmath1 ratio is sensitive to both pressure and temperature , the intense he  i lines in css  120422  disfavor the possibility that the secondary star is a brown dwarf .    indeed , at first blush , css  120422  is almost identical to css  100603 , the system reported by @xcite . in both of these sub - period - minimum systems ,",
    "the accretion disk shows high levels of both hydrogen and helium , and the late - type donor is spectroscopically undetectable . in their theoretical examination of am  cvn progenitors , @xcite identify the presence of hydrogen as conspicuous evidence favoring the evolved - cv channel over the double - white - dwarf and helium - star channels of am  cvn formation ;",

    "system is the donor fully degenerate yet . to reach this conclusion about css  100603 ,",
    "@xcite relied upon models of fully degenerate helium stars , and we took a similar approach with css  120422 . specifically , we used equation 15 in @xcite ( a mass - radius relation for a fully degenerate helium star ) and set it equal to equation 6 in @xcite ( a formula for the radius of a roche - lobe - filling star given its mass and orbital period ) .",
    "together , these formulae reveal that if the secondary were a degenerate helium star with an orbital period of 0.9227  hours , its mass would be 0.0083m@xmath46which , given the mass ratio of 0.06 , implies an unreasonably low wd mass of 0.14m@xmath46 . alternatively ,",

    "the velocity information contained within a trailed spectrum can be used to reconstruct an indirect image of the disk in velocity coordinates ( as opposed to spatial coordinates ) .",
    "known as doppler tomography , this technique essentially generates an inside - out image of the disk @xcite . using the doppler tomography algorithm of @xcite",
    ", we find that the competing s - waves in the h@xmath1 trailed spectrum correspond with two distinct emission regions located on opposite sides of the disk ( fig .",
    "[ tomogram ] ) .",
    "the bright spot in the @xmath48v@xmath49,+v@xmath50 quadrant , which has a noticeably higher velocity than the other emission , is almost certainly attributable to the shock created by the stream - disk interaction , but the emission in the + v@xmath49,@xmath48v@xmath50 quadrant  which consists of both intermediate- and low - velocity components  presents a more of a mystery , one which we address in the following two subsections .",
    "in other cvs , there have been at least two major proposed explanations for non - uniform emission of this sort .",
    "one possibility is that the outer disk contains spiral arms produced by the tidal torque of the secondary .",
    "spiral shocks facilitate angular momentum transfer in the disk , and in cvs with very low mass ratios , spirals can be permanent features in the disk because material in the outer disk attains a 2:1 orbital resonance with the donor @xcite . in cvs with relatively high mass ratios ,",
    "tidal forces dissipate the outer disk before it can expand to the 2:1 resonance , but calculations by both @xcite and @xcite found that when @xmath51 , the 2:1 resonance is inside the tidal truncation radius .",
    "observationally , several cvs have shown strong evidence of spiral structure stemming from the 2:1 resonance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we favor the presence of spiral shocks in as the source of the features observed in our doppler tomogram . given that @xmath43 , the 2:1 resonance in css  120422  rests within the tidal truncation radius , making it possible for permanent spiral structure to develop as described in @xcite .",
    "we further note that the overall appearance of our tomogram is very similar to a simulated tomogram of a disk with spiral arms caused by disk material at this very resonance @xcite . to test more quantitatively for the presence of disk material at the 2:1 resonance",
    ", we again adopted a wd mass of 0.83m@xmath46 ( see our footnote  [ mass ] ) and computed the keplerian velocity of disk material with an orbital period of exactly half of the system s orbital period . according to the formula @xmath52 { \\frac{2\\pi gm_{wd}}{p}},\\ ] ]",
    "the corresponding resonance velocity for these parameters is 750 km s@xmath10 , which we plot as a circle around the origin in the tomogram .",
    "although there are obvious pitfalls with simply assuming the wd s mass , the overlaid circle intersects much of the intense , non - uniform emission , furnishing circumstantial evidence that the disk in css  120422  did extend to the 2:1 resonance when we observed the system .",
    "just as importantly , @xcite calculated that spiral structure in such a system would produce a double - peaked light curve and presented a simulated phase plot which matches ours with uncanny accuracy .",
    "kunze and speith predict that both the minima and maxima will be unequal , with the deepest minimum coming at phase @xmath00.25 and a weaker one at phase @xmath00.75 ; the global maximum occurs at phase zero , and the weaker peak at phase @xmath00.55 . compared with the corresponding features in kunze s and speith s simulated light curve , the secondary maximum and minimum in our phase plot ( fig .",
    "[ vatt ] ) are somewhat feeble in appearance .",
    "this relatively minor disparity might be because the simulations assume a higher inclination than the one actually observed in css  120422 .",
    "alternatively , non - uniform disk emission might be the result of an accretion stream which overflows the disk after its initial collision , a mechanism which has received a great deal of attention in theoretical studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the overflowing stream would cloak portions of the disk , producing absorption at certain photometric phases and spectroscopic velocities , as it accelerated toward the inner disk .",
    "the reimpact of the stream with the disk , in turn , would produce an inner hotspot which , according to @xcite , would be much more apparent in a system with a low - luminosity accretion disk",
    ". the emission in the + v@xmath49,@xmath48v@xmath50 quadrant of our tomogram , therefore , might be such a feature .",
    "a shortcoming of the stream - overflow hypothesis is that the inner bright spot should have a noticeably higher velocity than the outer bright spot because the wd s strong gravity would significantly accelerate the overflowing stream .",
    "we observe the reverse ; the second bright spot in the + v@xmath49,@xmath48v@xmath50 quadrant has a _ lower _ velocity than the stream - disk interaction .",
    "thus , the lower - than - expected velocity weighs against the possibility of an overflowing accretion stream .",
    "furthermore , an overflowing stream would probably produce absorption at most phases , something which we do not observe .    though we can not rule out the possibility of stream overflow , spiral shocks",
    "elegantly weave the spectroscopy , photometry , and mass ratio of css  120422  into a reasonably coherent theory of the system , one which is less speculative than the stream - overflow model .",
    "we have reported photometry and spectroscopy of css  120422:111127 + 571239 , a cv with an orbital period over 20  minutes below the period minimum .",
    "while the system is hydrogen - rich , its helium - to - hydrogen ratio is much higher than in typical su  uma - type cvs , and the donor is completely invisible in our spectra .",
    "we identify spectroscopic and photometric periods of 52.2  minutes and 55.36  minutes , respectively . using the 55-minute period and the previously reported superhump period @xcite , we estimate a mass ratio of @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , doppler tomography reveals two distinct regions of intense h@xmath1 emission on the disk , consistent with spiral shocks produced when material in the outer disk reaches a 2:1 resonance with the secondary .",
    "drawing upon theoretical light curves of low - mass - ratio cvs , we suspect that these spiral arms are responsible for the intermittently double - peaked orbital modulation in the photometry , which is reminiscent of the variation observed in wz  sge stars .",
    "the best explanation for the short orbital period and the elevated helium abundance is that css  120422  is a progenitor of an am  cvn system following the evolved - cv track , similar to the system reported by @xcite .",
    "the discovery of two systems of this type in such rapid succession substantiates theoretical predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the evolved cv channel of evolution can contribute significantly to the galactic am cvn population .",
    "the results presented here are partially based on observations made with the vatt : the alice p. lennon telescope and the thomas j. bannan astrophysics facility .",
    "we thank richard boyle and the vatican observatory research group for providing time on the vatt for this project .",
    "the mods spectrographs were built with funding from the nsf grant ast-9987045 and the nsf telescope system instrumentation program ( tsip ) , with additional funds from the ohio board of regents and the ohio state university office of research .",
