    "the polarizations of hyperons have been widely used to study various aspects of spin effects in high energy reactions , in particular , the spin - dependent fragmentation functions for their self spin - analyzing parity violating decay @xcite .",
    "one of the important aspects in this connection is the spin transfer in high energy fragmentation processes . here , it is of particular interest to know whether su(6 ) wave - function or the results drawn from polarized deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering and related data",
    "should be used in connecting the polarization of the fragmenting quark and that of the produced hadrons .",
    "clearly such study can provide us with useful information on hadronization mechanism and the spin structure of hadron .",
    "theoretical calculations of hyperon polarizations in different reactions have been carried out using different models @xcite .",
    "the results show , in particular , that it is possible to differentiate different pictures by measuring the polarizations of different hyperons in @xmath2 annihilations , polarized deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering at high energies , and in the high transverse momentum regions in polarized @xmath3 collisions .",
    "they show also that the decay contributions to @xmath4 polarization are usually high and should be taken into account in the calculations , and that the contamination from the fragmentation of remnant of target in deeply inelastic scattering at relatively low energies such as the cern nomad or desy hermes energies are very important .",
    "both of them have to be taken into account in comparing theoretical predictions with the experimental results .",
    "presently , data in this connection are already available for @xmath4 polarization in @xmath2 annihilation at the @xmath5 pole @xcite , in deeply inelastic scattering using neutrino beam @xcite and that using electron or muon beam @xcite .",
    "but the amount of data and the statistics of them are still not high enough to judge which picture is better .",
    "more complementary measurements are necessary and some of them are underway . in this connection , it is interesting to note that the nomad and compass collaboration at cern has measured not only the polarization of @xmath4 but also that of @xmath6 @xcite . since the polarization of antihyperon in semi - inclusive deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering is definitely more sensitive to the nucleon sea , it is thus instructive to make more detailed study in this direction not only to get more information on spin transfer in fragmentation but also on nucleon spin structure .    in this paper , we make calculations of the polarizations of antihyperons in lepton induced reactions such as @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the general formulas used in these calculations and summarize the key points of different models for spin transfer in fragmentation .",
    "we present the results for antihyperon polarizations in sec .",
    "iii and compare them with those for hyperons and available data .",
    "we give a short summary and an outlook in sec .",
    "as have been shown in @xcite , to calculate hyperon polarization in high energy reactions , it is necessary to take also the decay contribution into account . in this section ,",
    "we present the general formulas for such calculations with the contribution from decay .",
    "we first present the formulas for a pure quark fragmentation in sec .",
    "ii a , then the formulas for hyperon and antihyperon polarization in sec .",
    "ii b. we summarize the key points of a few models for spin transfer in fragmentation processes in sec .",
    "ii c.      we first present the formulas for a pure quark fragmentation which are the basis for different reactions .",
    "we present the formulas for @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and the relations between them obtained from charge conjugation symmetry .",
    "now we consider the fragmentation process @xmath10 , where we use the subscript @xmath14 to denote the flavor of the quark , @xmath15 to denote hyperon .",
    "we use @xmath16 to denote the fragmentation function , which is defined as the number density of @xmath15 produced in the fragmentation of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the fraction of momentum of @xmath17 carried away by @xmath15 .",
    "we do not study the transverse momentum dependence in this paper so an integration over transverse momentum is understood . in general ,",
    "if the contribution from decay is taken into account , @xmath19 can be written as two parts , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the directly produced part and the decay contribution respectively .",
    "it is clear that the decay contribution can be calculated from the following convolution , @xmath23 where the kernel function @xmath24 is the probability for @xmath25 with a fractional momentum @xmath26 to decay into an @xmath15 with @xmath18 and anything . if we consider , as usual , only the @xmath27 octet and @xmath28 decuplet baryon production , most of the decay processes are two body decay . for an unpolarized two body decay @xmath29 , the kernel function @xmath24 can be calculated easily . in this case , the magnitude of the momentum of the decay product in the rest frame of @xmath25 is fixed and it has to be isotropically distributed . by making a lorentz transformation of this isotropic distribution to the moving frame of @xmath25 , we obtain the result for @xmath24 as given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the corresponding decay branching ratio , @xmath32 is a normalization constant , @xmath33 is the energy of @xmath34 in the rest frame of @xmath25 which is a function of the masses @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 of @xmath25 , @xmath34 and @xmath38 .    similarly , in polarized case , we have @xmath39 where @xmath40 , and the @xmath41 or @xmath42 denotes that the produced @xmath15 is polarized in the same or opposite direction as the initial quark @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are the corresponding quantities for directly produced @xmath15 and decay contribution . for decay contribution",
    ", we have @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the spin transfer factor for the decay process @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath46 is a constant which is independent of the process where @xmath25 is produced .",
    "it is completely determined by the decay process . for different decay processes ,",
    "@xmath46 can be found , e.g. , in table ii of @xcite .",
    "the unknowns left now are @xmath21 and @xmath43 .",
    "they are determined by the hadronization mechanism and the structure of hadrons .",
    "presently , we can calculate @xmath21 using a hadronization model or using a parametrization of fragmentation functions . for @xmath43 , there are also different models in literature @xcite .",
    "we will briefly summarize a few of them in sec .",
    "ii c.      for @xmath12 , we have @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 @xmath50      for @xmath11 , we have @xmath51 @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 here we assume that the charge conjugation symmetry is applicable to the decay process so that the relations @xmath55 and @xmath56 are valid",
    ". we assume also the validity of the charge conjugation symmetry for the fragmentation functions and obtain further the following relations : @xmath57 @xmath58 for total , the direct ( @xmath59 ) and decay ( @xmath60 ) parts respectively .      for @xmath13 , we use charge conjugation symmetry and obtain that @xmath61 @xmath62 for total , the direct ( @xmath59 ) and decay ( @xmath60 ) parts respectively .",
    "hence , in the following , we need only to write out the formulas for @xmath10 and @xmath12 .",
    "those for the other two cases are obtained from charge conjugation symmetry .",
    "independent of the models , we expect the following qualitative features for @xmath21 and @xmath43 .",
    "since hadrons containing the initial quark , i.e. the first rank hadrons in feynman - field type of cascade fragmentation models , usually carry a large fraction of momentum of the initial quark , we expect that , for large @xmath18 @xmath63 @xmath64 but for small @xmath18 , they can be comparable . since @xmath65 due to spin transfer is expected to be significant for large @xmath18 , we should see that @xmath66 this implies that the qualitative behavior of @xmath65 in a given reaction is determined mainly by quark fragmentation and that of @xmath67 is determined mainly by anti - quark fragmentation .      to calculate the polarization of hyperon or antihyperon in a given reaction , we need to sum over the contributions from the fragmentation of quarks and anti - quarks of different flavors .",
    "for example , for @xmath68 , we have @xmath69,\\ ] ] @xmath70,\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the fractional momentum carried by the produced @xmath15 ; @xmath72 denotes the cross section for the production of @xmath17 or @xmath73 in @xmath74 collisions and @xmath75 denotes the kinematic variables describing cross section ; @xmath76 is the polarization of @xmath17 , and similar for @xmath77 . in general",
    ", they can be dependent on some kinematic variables hence we use @xmath78 to denote convolutions . or equivalently",
    ", we have , @xmath79,\\ ] ] @xmath80,\\ ] ] @xmath81,\\ ] ] @xmath82,\\ ] ] where we use @xmath83 and @xmath84 to denote the number density of @xmath15 and that of @xmath85 at a given momentum fraction @xmath71 produced in the reaction respectively , @xmath86 and @xmath87 to denote the corresponding differences in the polarized case . @xmath88 and @xmath77 are respectively the polarization of @xmath17 and that of @xmath73 ; @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the fractional contributions of @xmath91 and @xmath92 to the whole hadronic events .",
    "they are related to @xmath93 by @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the total inelastic cross section for hadron production in @xmath74 collisions .",
    "the final result for the polarization is given by , @xmath96 @xmath97    for different reactions , the fragmentation functions @xmath98 s and @xmath99 s are assumed to be universal , but the results of @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath88 and @xmath77 are different .",
    "these differences lead to different results for the polarization of hyperons and/or antihyperons . in the following ,",
    "we summarize the formulas in different lepton induced reactions , respectively , and discuss the qualitative features of these results .",
    "the numerical results are given in sec .",
    "iii .      at high energies , due to the contribution through weak - interaction at the @xmath2 annihilation vertex such as @xmath101 , the initial @xmath17 and @xmath73",
    "are longitudinally polarized .",
    "the magnitude of the polarization of @xmath17 and that of @xmath73 are the same but the sign are different .",
    "they are constants at a given center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "energy of @xmath2 system .",
    "also the relative weights for the contributions of different flavors are constants when averaging over the different jet ( or initial quark ) directions .",
    "they are the same for quarks and for anti - quarks .",
    "namely , we have @xmath102 @xmath103 and @xmath104 is given by @xmath105 for example , for reactions at the @xmath5-pole , we neglect the contribution from the annihilation via virtual photon .",
    "we have @xmath106 for @xmath107 or @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 , or @xmath111 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath112,\\ ] ] @xmath113.\\ ] ] for antihyperons , we have @xmath114,\\ ] ] @xmath115.\\ ] ] we see that , @xmath116 @xmath117 this means that , under the charge conjugation symmetries for the fragmentation functions and decay processes , we have @xmath118 this result is true independent of model for fragmentation functions . it is a direct consequence of the charge conjugation symmetries for fragmentation and decay processes .",
    "since we do not have the contaminations from the initial state such as the structure of nucleon in this reaction , this is an ideal place to test such charge conjugation symmetries .      at sufficiently large energies and momentum transfer @xmath120 ,",
    "hadron produced in the current fragmentation region of semi - inclusive deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering such as @xmath119 can be considered as a pure product of fragmentation of the struck quark . in this case , the cross sections are given by @xmath121,\\ ] ] @xmath122,\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is the mott cross section ; @xmath124 is the usual bjorken @xmath124 ; @xmath125 is the fractional energy transfer in the rest frame of the nucleon ; and @xmath18 is the fraction of momentum of struck @xmath126 carried by @xmath15 .",
    "the polarization of the struck quark @xmath17 and that of anti - quark @xmath73 are given by @xmath127 @xmath128 for longitudinally polarized case , where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are polarizations of the incident electron and nucleon , respectively ; @xmath131 is the longitudinal spin transfer factor in @xmath132 .",

    "we see also that , in general , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , they are equal only if @xmath142 and @xmath143 .    for the corresponding number densities of @xmath15 or @xmath85 in @xmath144 ,",
    "we have @xmath145,\\ ] ] @xmath146,\\ ] ] @xmath147,\\ ] ] @xmath148,\\ ] ]    now , we compare the results for @xmath85 with those for @xmath15 , and we see the following qualitative features in the two different cases .    in the first case",
    ", we consider reactions at very high energies so that small @xmath124 contribution dominates . in this case",
    ", we can neglect the valence - quark contributions with good accuracy , i.e. , @xmath149 and @xmath150 , where the subscript @xmath151 denote `` sea . ''",
    "if we assume the charge conjugation symmetry in nucleon sea , i.e. , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 , we expect only a very small difference between quark and anti - quark distributions , i.e. , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 . hence , we expect that , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and finally @xmath158 .    in the second case",
    ", we consider reactions where large @xmath124 contributions dominate . in this case",
    ", valence - quark contribution plays an important role and there should be significant differences between quark and anti - quark distributions | thus significant differences between @xmath65 and @xmath67 .",
    "to get some feeling of these differences , we make the following rough estimations .    we denote @xmath159 , ( where the @xmath160 and @xmath151 in the subscripts denote valence or sea contribution ) , and expect the following approximate relations , if we neglect the flavor - dependence in the quark distribution functions : @xmath161 @xmath162 @xmath163    these approximate relations can be used to give us some guidances of the qualitative features of hyperon and antihyperon polarizations in the reaction . for example , for @xmath164 , we note further that , @xmath165 and for large @xmath18 both of them have the strangeness suppressions factor @xmath166 relative to @xmath167 and that both @xmath168 and @xmath169 have , if any , small and negative contributions to the spin of @xmath4 but @xmath151 has large and positive contribution .",
    "hence , for reactions where the valence - quark contributions dominate for hyperon production , we expect @xmath170 dominates in large @xmath18 region , and @xmath171 should be small .",
    "but for @xmath6 , there is no contribution from valence - quark to the first rank particles ; we expect that , for large @xmath18 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 give comparable contributions to @xmath174 ptroduction and @xmath175 should be mainly determined by @xmath173 .",
    "this implies that , in this case , @xmath175 should be positive and the magnitude is much larger than @xmath171 at large @xmath18 values .",

    "the produced @xmath15 s are divided into the following four categories : ( a ) those are directly produced and contain @xmath17 ; ( b ) decay products of polarized heavy hyperons ; ( c ) those are directly produced and do not contain @xmath17 ; ( d ) decay products of unpolarized heavy hyperons . this is to say that we divide further @xmath257 @xmath258 for the polarized case , @xmath259 @xmath260    it is assumed that , @xmath261 @xmath262 here , @xmath263 is a constant and is taken as , @xmath264 where @xmath265 and @xmath266 are the fractional contribution of spin of quark with flavor @xmath14 to the spin of @xmath15 and the number of valence - quarks of flavor @xmath14 in @xmath15 . clearly , @xmath267 is different in the su(6 ) picture from those drawn from polarized deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) data .",
    "they are given in e.g. table i of @xcite .",
    "the decay contribution part @xmath268 is calculated using eq.(5 ) , i.e. , @xmath269,\\ ] ]    we should note that , in the feynman - field type of recursive cascade fragmentation model , @xmath270 is nothing else but the probability to produce a first rank @xmath15 with @xmath18 .",
    "it is usually denoted by @xmath271 in such fragmentation models , i.e. , @xmath272 it follows that , @xmath273 in this case , we have , @xmath274 @xmath275.\\ ] ]    in this model , for @xmath276 , we should have , @xmath277 @xmath278    we recall that @xmath271 is a quite essential input in such recursive cascade models . in most cases , there exist explicit expression for it .",
    "hence , the @xmath18 dependence of @xmath99 in this model is determined by the fragmentation model for unpolarized case , which are empirically known from the experimental facts for unpolarized reactions .",
    "the only unknown is the spin transfer constant @xmath263 for type ( a ) hyperon which influences mainly the magnitudes of the polarizations of the hyperons .",
    "so the ingredients of this model can be tested separately by testing the @xmath18 dependence and magnitudes of the polarizations .    in @xcite ,",
    "calculations have been carried out using a monte carlo event generator @xcite jetset for @xmath2 annihilation and pythia for @xmath279 or @xmath3 collisions based on lund fragmentation model @xcite .",
    "a set of formulas are given there which are more convenient for monte carlo calculations .",
    "in @xcite , @xmath195 has been calculated using the following proportionality relation , i.e. , @xmath280 and @xmath281 , which they referred as `` gribov relation '' since it was first shown in @xcite by gribov and collaborator in 1971 . in terms of the language given above , this relation , if true , should be valid for the directly produced part , i.e. @xmath282 @xmath283 the decay contribution parts can be calculated using eq.(5 ) .    for @xmath276",
    ", we have similar results , i.e. @xmath284 @xmath285    in @xcite , as an approximation , decay contributions are not considered .",
    "other models for @xmath195 have also discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "they are essentially different combinations of the two models discussed above .",
    "we will not go to the details of these models but refer the interested readers to the references .",
    "by applying the formulas presented in the last section to different reactions , we obtain the results for the polarization of hyperons and antihyperons in these reactions .",
    "we use the model for @xmath195 as described in the first subsection of sec .",

    "the results for hyperon polarization are given in @xcite .",
    "we present the results for antihyperons and compare them with those for the corresponding hyperon in the following .",
    "as we have shown in section iib , the results for antihyperons in @xmath2 annihilations differ from those for the corresponding hyperons only by a minus sign .",
    "we will not repeat them here .",
    "we will present the results for @xmath286 and those for @xmath287 , respectively , in the following .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : muphigh ] , we show the results for antihyperons in @xmath286 with polarized beam or target .",
    "clearly the situation is completely the same for @xmath288 or @xmath289 , where one virtual photon exchange plays the dominate role .",
    "the incident energy of electron is taken as @xmath290 gev off a fixed target .",
    "we take this electron energy to gurantee that the energy is already high enough that we need only take the struck quark or anti - quark fragmentation into account when we look at the current fragmentation region .",
    "the results are shown as functions of @xmath18 , where @xmath291 , @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "the results depend not much on the energy so long as @xmath294 is considerably large ( say , larger than @xmath295gev ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : muphigh ] , we see that there is indeed little difference between the results for hyperons and those for antihyperons at such energies for reactions with polarized beams .",
    "this confirms the qualitative expectations presented in sec.iib .",
    "we also see that the polarizations are much larger in reactions with polarized beams than those for reactions where only the nucleon target is polarized .",
    "the results in the latter case are very sensitive to the parametrization of polarized quark ( anti - quark ) distribution functions used .",
    "the relatively large difference between the results for hyperons and those for the corresponding antihyperons reflects the differences in the polarized quark ( anti - quark ) distributions .    to compare the results with the results @xcite from compass at cern",
    ", we lowered the energy to @xmath296gev and obtained the results as shown in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : mupcompasshermes ] .",
    "our results show that , at this energy , the difference between the results for @xmath4 and those for @xmath6 polarization is also quite small , in particular , in the @xmath297 region .",
    "the difference can be a little bit significant only for larger @xmath71 . according to this result",
    ", we should not see a large difference between @xmath171 and @xmath298 as indicated by the compass data @xcite .    as we have discussed in last section , in the theoretical framework described in this paper ,",
    "the following symmetries are supposed : ( i ) charge conjugation symmetry in the fragmentation functions and decay processes [ see eqs.(14)(17 ) ] ; and ( ii ) charge conjugation symmetry in nucleon sea in particular @xmath299 and @xmath300 . in this case , the origins of the difference between the polarizations of hyperons and those of antihyperons can be only the contributions from the valence - quarks of the initial nucleons .",
    "our results show that the valence - quark contributions are already quite small at the compass energy . to see this explicitly ,",
    "we have examined the @xmath124 values of the struck quark or antiquark for events with the kinematic constraints as imposed by compass .",
    "( here , @xmath124 is the bjorken @xmath124 used in describing deeply inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering . )",
    "the results are shown in fig.[fig : averagexcompass ] . here , in fig.[fig :",

    "we see that the @xmath124 value of the struck quark or anti - quark can be as small as @xmath301 .",
    "we see also that @xmath302 in this case is in general of the order of 0.01 for most of the @xmath71 values . in this @xmath124 region",
    ", @xmath303 is already dominated by the sea quark distribution @xmath304 .",
    "there exists a valence - quark contribution @xmath305 , but it is much smaller than @xmath304 .",
    "this is why the obtained @xmath67 differs little from @xmath65 .",
    "another effect that relates to the valence - quark contribution and may cause a difference between @xmath65 and @xmath67 in @xmath119 is the contribution from the hadronization of the remnant of target nucleon .",
    "it has been pointed out first in @xcite that contribution of the hadronization of target remnant is important to hyperon production even for reasonably large @xmath71 at lower energies .",
    "the effect has been confirmed by the calculations presented in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that @xcite at the cern nomad energies , contribution from the hadronization of nucleon target remnant dominates hyperon production at @xmath18 around zero .",
    "it is impossible to separate the contribution of the struck quark fragmentation from those of the target remnant fragmentation .",
    "clearly , this effect can be different for hyperon and antihyperon production since the target remnant contribution comes mainly from the fragmentation of the valence diquark .",
    "it contributes quite differently for hyperons and antihyperons . to see whether this effect plays an important role at compass energy ,",
    "we have also calculated the contributions of target remnant fragmentation .",
    "we found out that this contribution is already very small for @xmath306 at the compass energy .",
    "to see the influence on hyperon polarizations , we have also included the contributions in the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mupcompasshermes](a ) by using a valence - quark model for the quark polarization in the remnant of the target as described in @xcite .",
    "we see that there is indeed some influence at @xmath297 for the polarization of the hyperons but the effect is already very small at the compass energy .",
    "after having made these checks , we are quite confident that the valence - quark contributions are quite small at the compass energy . hence , under the conjugation symmetries in fragmentation function , decay processes and in nucleon sea , there should not be a large difference between @xmath171 and @xmath175 at compass energy .",
    "a significant difference could be a signature for the violation of such conjugation symmetries . in view of the recent discussions on the asymmetric strange and antistrange sea @xcite",
    ", it would be very significant to check whether similar asymmetry is also possible for the polarized case .",
    "we also made the calculations at hermes energy , i.e. at @xmath307gev .",
    "the results are shown in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : mupcompasshermes ] .",
    "we found out that at this energy , the major contribution comes mainly from the @xmath124-region of @xmath308 . in this @xmath124 region",
    ", valence - quark plays an important role .",
    "hence , we obtained a significant difference between the polarizations of antihyperons and those of hyperons in the current fragmentation region .",
    "we see , in particular , that the difference for @xmath4 and @xmath6 is indeed as expected in the qualitative analysis given in sec .",
    "ii b 2 .",
    "we also calculated the contribution from target remnant fragmentation and found that it is important at hermes energy .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : muphermesdistribution ] , where different contributions to @xmath4 at this energy are shown .",
    "we see clearly that the contribution from target remnant fragmentation is much higher than that from the struck quarks in the region near @xmath309 . to show the influence of this effect on the polarizations , we calculate these contributions from target remnant fragmentation using a valence - quark model for the polarizations of the quarks in the remnant of the nucleon as described in @xcite . the results are added to the struck quark fragmentation contribution and are shown in fig . [ fig : mupcompasshermes](b ) .",
    "we see that the contribution is very important in the @xmath297 region .",
    "it is therefore meaningless to factorize the @xmath4 production cross section as one usually does at very high energies .",
    "on the other hand , the influence from target remnant fragmentation to antihyperon polarization is negligibly small .",
    "this is another reason for the differences between the polarizations of hyperons and those of antihyperons shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mupcompasshermes](b ) in particular at the @xmath297 region .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : neupnhigh ] , we show the results obtained for @xmath310 at an incident muon - neutrino beam energy @xmath311 off a fixed target .",
    "we calculated for proton and neutron target and different hyperons and antihyperons . to obtain the results for @xmath4 ,",
    "we simply take @xmath312 as we did in [ 7 ] . from these figures , we see that the results for hyperons and those for antihyperons are indeed significantly different from each other .",
    "these features are quite different from that in electron nucleon collision where hyperon and antihyperon polarizations are essentially the same at very high energies .",
    "the qualitative features are the same as we obtained in the qualitative analysis using eqs.(65 ) and ( 66 ) in the last section .",
    "we also calculated the polarizations for antihyperons at the cern nomad energies .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neupnnomad ] . as it has been pointed out in @xcite , at this energy , contribution from the fragmentation of the remnant of target nucleon to",
    "hyperon production is very important .",
    "we also included this contribution from a rough estimation by using a valence - quark model for the polarization of the quarks in the target remnant as in @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the polarizations obtained for hyperons at this energy differ significantly from those obtained at very high energis as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neupnhigh ] .",
    "but for antihyperons , this contribution is small thus the difference between the results and those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neupnhigh ] is small .",
    "this is also one of the reasons for the differences between the results for hyperons and those for antihyperons , in particular , in the @xmath297 region .",
    "the qualitative features are consistent with the nomad data @xcite and it will be interesting to make high statistics check in the future .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the polarizations of antihyperons in lepton induced reactions , in particular @xmath313 at different energies with polarized beams , using different models for spin transfer for fragmentation .",
    "the results show little difference between the polarization of antihyperon and that of the corresponding hyperon in @xmath314 at compass or higher energies when the charge conjugation symmetries for fragmentation , decay and nucleon sea are assumed .",
    "but there are in general large differences between those for antihyperons and the corresponding hyperons in neutrino induced charged current reactions since the flavors of dominant fragmenting quarks and those of the anti - quarks and their polarizations are different .",
