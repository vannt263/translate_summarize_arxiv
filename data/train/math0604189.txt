    "directed last - passage percolation in two dimensions has received much attention in recent years . in certain specific cases , for example where the weights at each site are i.i.d .  with exponential or geometric distribution , very precise scaling laws and asymptotic distributions",
    "are now known , both for the passage times and for the shape of optimal paths ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "such cases are closely related to the longest increasing subsequence problem , and to markovian interacting particle systems such as the totally asymmetric exclusion process ; there are also very close links to random matrix theory , for example to the behaviour of the largest eigenvalue of a large matrix drawn from the gaussian unitary ensemble ( see for example @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "it is believed that the behaviour proved for the exponential and geometric cases should be _ universal _ , in that the same scaling laws and asymptotic distributions should occur in the last - passage percolation model whose underlying weight distribution is from a much more general class ( certainly including any distribution with an exponentially decaying tail , and maybe also those with sufficiently light polynomial tails ) .",
    "the growth models corresponding to these last - passage percolation problems should belong to the _ kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) universality class _ ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "however , only very limited universality results have been proved : for example , conditions under which laws of large numbers for the passage times ( or `` shape theorems '' ) hold , and asymptotics for passage - times close to the boundary of the quadrant @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study cases in which the tail of the weight distribution is sufficiently heavy that such shape theorems fail , and which certainly fall outside the universality class described above .",
    "specifically , we assume that the tail of the weight distribution is regularly varying with index @xmath0 .",
    "we describe a family of `` continuous last - passage percolation '' models ( indexed by @xmath1 ) , and use them to provide scaling laws and asymptotic distributions for the discrete models , both for the passage times and for the shape of the optimal paths .",
    "thus we have a universality result for these heavy - tailed models as the only information required to determine the scaling limits is the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "one example of an application where such a heavy - tailed assumption is very natural is in the use of last - passage models to represent networks of _ queues in tandem_. the vertex weights in the percolation models correspond to service times in the queueing systems , and passage times in the percolation models correspond to the total time spent in the queueing system by particular customers ; see for example @xcite .",
    "in section [ main ] , we define the discrete last - passage percolation model precisely ; we then describe the continuous last - passage model and state our main convergence results .",
    "we also derive from the continuous model a stationary process which can be seen as a heavy - tailed analogue of the _ airy process _",
    "( which was developed by prhofer and spohn @xcite and johansson @xcite ) , and which gives a process limit for vectors of passage times to different points , appropriately scaled .",
    "the proofs of the convergence results for passage - times are given in section [ tsection ] , and those for the optimal paths are given in section [ pathsection ] .",
    "the results on the heavy - tailed airy process are proved in section [ airysection ] .    in section [ greedysection ]",
    "we explore the case where the tail of the weight distribution is _ slowly varying _",
    "( i.e.  @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is no longer possible to provide a non - degenerate limiting distribution for the passage times ; however , asymptotics for the form of the optimal paths are still possible , and in fact the distribution of the limiting path that arises can be described in a particularly simple and algorithmic way . as the path is increasing it can be thought of as the distribution of a random measure on @xmath3 $ ] ; this measure is self - similar and we compute its multifractal spectrum .",
    "the _ brownian directed percolation _ model has recently been much studied in various contexts ( see for example @xcite ) . in section [ stablesection ]",
    "we discuss a related model in which brownian motion is replaced by an @xmath1-stable lvy process , and we again prove distributional convergence to the continuous last passage percolation model .    the bulk of the paper concerns the case of two - dimensional last - passage percolation .",
    "however , almost all of the results extend easily to @xmath5 dimensions , @xmath6 , and now apply for @xmath7 .",
    "we indicate these extensions in section [ dsection ] .",

    "however , as @xmath70 , the probability that any of the @xmath59 largest jumps occur in the process @xmath455 tends to 0 ( it is no larger than @xmath456 ) ; so with high probability , the procedure in the previous paragraph does not alter the value of @xmath454 .",

    "thus indeed we have @xmath840 putting the three pieces together we have shown the weak convergence .",
    "up to this point we have considered only two - dimensional models . in this section",
    "we indicate how to extend most of the results to higher dimensions in a natural way .    for general @xmath841 , we consider the passage time from the point @xmath842 to the point @xmath843 .",
    "we now consider a sequence of locations @xmath844 , @xmath845 which form a uniform random permutation of the set @xmath846^d$ ] , and a corresponding sequence of weights @xmath847 , @xmath848 which are given by the order statistics , in decreasing order , of a sample of size @xmath849 from the underlying weight distribution @xmath8 .",
    "we now assume that the tail of @xmath8 is regularly varying with index @xmath7 .    defining @xmath48 as before",
    ", we set @xmath850 , and @xmath851 .    the continuous model is defined just as before ; the locations @xmath53 are now drawn i.i.d .  and uniformly at random from the box @xmath3^d$ ] rather than the square @xmath3 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath82 in distribution as @xmath70 ; the method of proof is essentially identical to that used for theorem [ ttheorem ] in the case @xmath852 .",
    "the multivariate extensions described in sections [ preairy ] and [ airysection ] go through in an analogous way . for example , we can now obtain a process @xmath853 which is stationary on @xmath854 such that @xmath855 as @xmath70 , in the sense of convergence of finite - dimensional distributions ; here @xmath856 is the maximal weight of a path from @xmath857 to the point @xmath858 .",
    "we turn to the path convergence as developed in section [ pathsection ] .",
    "proposition [ uniquenessprop ] and theorem [ paththeorem ] extend easily , with the same method of proof .",
    "however , extending theorem [ paththeorem2 ] , concerning the convergence of optimal paths viewed as random subsets of @xmath3^d$ ] , is more problematic .",
    "again we are unable to prove that the optimal path for the continuous model ( i.e.  the closure of @xmath388 ) is connected ( although we expect this to be true ) . in the case @xmath852 this caused a little inconvenience but we could work around it by observing that any `` jumps '' in the path consist of horizontal or vertical line segments , and hence that at least there exists a unique connected increasing path that contains the optimal path .    for @xmath6",
    ", however , a jump could , for example , cross a square of zero volume in @xmath854 but with non - zero area .",
    "then there is no longer a unique way to extend the optimal path to a connected increasing path , and thus there is an ambiguity in the limit object . if we could prove the conjecture that the optimal path itself is connected , the convergence in distribution of the discrete optimal paths @xmath96 would follow as before .    in the case",
    "@xmath2 , we can in fact prove the connectedness of the optimal path for the continuous model ( defined as in section [ greedysection ] using the `` greedy algorithm '' ) .",
    "it is not clear how to extend the multifractal analysis of section [ greedysubsection ] .",
    "however , by analysing a branching random walk associated with the algorithm which constructs the greedy path , one can obtain that the function from , say , @xmath859 $ ] to @xmath860^{d-1}$ ] which describes the path is almost surely everywhere continuous and strictly increasing ( although a.s .",
    "it also has derivative 0 almost everywhere ) .",
    "thus one can show that @xmath392 in distribution ( under the hausdorff metric on subsets of @xmath3^d$ ] ) for all @xmath5 in the case @xmath2 .",
