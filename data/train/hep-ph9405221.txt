    "<S> it is shown that for small relative angle and kinetic energy two type i @xmath0 strings can form bound states upon collision instead of the more familiar intercommuting configuration . the velocity below which this may happen </S>",
    "<S> is estimated as function of the ratio of the coupling constants in the theory , crossing angle and initial kinetic energy .    </S>",
    "<S> cosmic strings formed at a grand unified symmetry breaking phase transition @xcite are a strong candidate to solve one of the most outstanding problems of cosmology namely that of structure seeding @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the standard cosmic string scenario assumes that strings after the phase transition rapidly approach the limit of zero width and become henceforth well described in terms of the nambu - goto action . </S>",
    "<S> the other necessary ingredient to specify the evolution of the network is that at each collision strings should exchange ends or in other words should intercommute . in particular , whenever two segments of the same long string intersect a loop will be formed . </S>",
    "<S> loops of string , in turn , are not globally topologically stable and will shrink by emitting their energy presumably as gravitational radiation . </S>",
    "<S> this process allows for a faster decrease of the energy density in strings and precludes the possibility of a string dominated universe .    </S>",
    "<S> this whole construction rests crucially on the assumption that the outcome of a string collision always corresponds to intercommuting . </S>",
    "<S> however , strings are in rigour classical non - trivial solutions of a variety of field theories displaying spontaneous symmetry breaking @xcite . the preferred model for realising string dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , however , is the abelian higgs model    @xmath1    in what follows we will also confine ourselves to it and its @xmath0 string solutions @xcite .    the only way to establish intercommuting as the necessary outcome of the collision between two cosmic strings is to study the dynamics of the full field theory solutions . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , involves solving a set of non - linear equations for the fields which proves to be a rather difficult task in most circumstances . </S>",
    "<S> one way out is to perform simulations of collisions by solving the theory numerically . </S>",
    "<S> this was done for several values of the ratio of the coupling constants in ( 1 ) , @xmath2 , supporting the conjecture that global , type ii and critically coupled strings ( i.e. , @xmath3 ) intercommute under essentially all circumstances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar studies regarding the behaviour of type i strings are much scarcer and seem to open the possibility for the existence of more complicated configurations @xcite .    for a collision between two cosmic strings </S>",
    "<S> to be analytically understood in terms of its underlying field theory one needs to look , in the first instance , at vortex dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , both strings , at the collision point , can be projected onto a set of two orthogonal planes , thus reducing the problem to the study of vortex dynamics in two dimensions @xcite . in this picture </S>",
    "<S> intercommuting results from the annihilation of a vortex - antivortex pair in one of these planes and the scattering at right angles of the vortex - vortex pair on the other . </S>",
    "<S> the scattering at right angles , in turn , is only fully understood analytically in the critically coupled regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this important result may , although possibly under more severe restrictions , generalise to non - critically coupled vortices . as a practical result the interactions should vanish at zero separation as </S>",
    "<S> is observed numerically @xcite , at least for @xmath4 not too far from unity . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture also seems to be well supported by several other numerical and semi - analytical recent studies of non - critically coupled vortex scattering dynamics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it then seems likely that the effect of the interactions between cosmic strings should be felt at intermediate distances , i.e. , of the order of several scalar field coherence lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the character of these is better known than their short distance counterpart . in particular , for @xmath5 ( type i ) @xcite these interactions are always attractive , regardless of the relative orientation of a pair of strings . in principle </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the possibility of formation of a bound state ( characterised by the sum of the individual winding numbers of the two original strings ) as the outcome of a sufficiently favourable collision between two string segments .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we explore this scenario by investigating what configurations could compete with the usual intercommuting as the outcome of the collision of two straight type i strings at an angle and under which circumstances these can be expected to prevail .    </S>",
    "<S> a typical intercommuting event that occurs at the origin at @xmath6 may be taken to be between two strings whose initial configuration is given ( for @xmath7 ) by    @xmath8    where @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath10 is the velocity of approach . </S>",
    "<S> we can write @xmath11 $ ] , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    then , @xmath14 and @xmath15    if we have the normal type of intercommuting event , the solution for @xmath16 is easy to describe . for @xmath17 , </S>",
    "<S> the previous solutions are still valid , but in the region where @xmath18 and @xmath19 the partners have swapped over . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions are as illustrated in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the `` horizontal '' pieces of string , in fig . 1 , are described by @xmath20 = ( t,\\xi \\sigma,\\eta t , - \\zeta \\sigma),\\ ] ] and @xmath21 = ( t,\\xi \\sigma,-\\eta t , \\zeta \\sigma).\\ ] ] note that the velocity on these sections is in the @xmath22-direction , not in the @xmath23-direction .    </S>",
    "<S> can we then find an alternative solution , based on the assumption that a segment of @xmath24 string is created at the moment of intersection ? </S>",
    "<S> from symmetry it is easy to see that if such a segment is created it should be static and directed along the @xmath25-axis . </S>",
    "<S> let us write @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the string tension for unit winding number , and @xmath28 the corresponding value for @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 is naturally a function of @xmath4 and , in particular for type i strings , we have @xmath30 . then the solution for the @xmath24 segment should be of the form @xmath31 it is reasonable to assume that the ends of this segment must move with definite velocity </S>",
    "<S> let us take @xmath32 to be the solution for @xmath33 in the range @xmath34 , for some @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> then the ends will move with speed @xmath36 ( obviously @xmath37 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overall shape must then be as illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , with four links at the same places as before receding with speed @xmath38 , joined to the doubled section by new straight segments . we can then write down the expressions for the string position on each of the straight segments , since we know the coordinates of the end - points @xmath39 equivalently we can write ,    @xmath40    to satisfy the consistency conditions , we require @xmath41 ^ 2 + ( 1+\\kappa)^2 \\eta ^2 + ( 1+\\kappa)^2 \\zeta^2 = ( 1-\\kappa)^2,\\ ] ] or equivalently @xmath42 which yields @xmath43    thus , the value of @xmath35 is given by @xmath44 clearly a solution exists , if and only if , @xmath45 this is equivalent to requiring the angle between the strings , @xmath46 , to be small , or the velocity of approach , @xmath10 , to be small or both . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath47 and consequently , ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) , @xmath48 the limit on the angle is then @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> it is not surprising that a `` zipper '' can exist only for small angles and/or velocities . in particular , for @xmath50 , @xmath51 @xcite , and the constraint ( 15 ) becomes quite severe .    </S>",
    "<S> having shown that the formation of `` zippers '' is possible in the nambu - goto approximation we investigate how the consideration of the interactions between the two colliding strings alters the corresponding constraints on the collision parameters ( 15 ) . in the nambu - goto approximation we have seen that the difference between the tension of the @xmath24 string when compared to that of the two @xmath52 strings added together , allowed for the formation of the `` zipper '' . in this approximation </S>",
    "<S> such a difference is restricted to the @xmath24 bridge only , disregarding the interactions between the two @xmath52 `` legs '' at each end of it . by including these interactions we </S>",
    "<S> should then be able not only to render our former construction more realistic but also to relax the rather tight constraints it imposed .    down to scalar coherence length separations </S>",
    "<S> it was shown @xcite that the interaction energy between two @xmath52 string elements at an angle @xmath46 , is given approximately by @xmath53 , \\ ] ] where @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand each vortex possesses a self - energy @xmath27 , which naturally emerges as the string tension in the nambu - goto approximation and can be seen as its inertial mass for the study of collisions . for general couplings </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 has to be computed numerically . a best fit to its dependence on @xmath4 yields @xcite @xmath56 which should be valid to about @xmath57 accuracy , in the range @xmath58    we can then investigate the existence of bound states by matching the kinetic energy of two segments emerging from the collision , in the center - of - mass frame , to the potential energy of the system at a given separation . in so doing </S>",
    "<S> we are assuming that only a finite length of string contributes to the dynamics , at the collision point . </S>",
    "<S> we express this in terms of a simple cutoff , @xmath59 , a length along the string measured from the point of collision and take the velocity of each string as seen from the center - of - mass frame , @xmath60 , to be constant within such an interval , should be largest and then decreasing to zero smoothly with increasing distance along the string . </S>",
    "<S> our procedure of introducing a simple cutoff @xmath59 , gives us , therefore , a measure of the total kinetic energy in the direction of separation , but not of its distribution along the string . ] . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure yields @xmath61,\\ ] ]    which , in turn , leads to    @xmath62    where @xmath63,\\ ] ] and @xmath64 we see , in particular , that if we take @xmath59 to infinity the integral in ( 20 ) should rapidly converge to a constant while the inverse proportionality of the velocity relative to @xmath59 ensures that the system will always be free . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , in the limit of vanishing @xmath59 , the picture for the collision of two vortices emerges , with the consequent drop in dependence on @xmath65 . for @xmath66 the integrand in ( 20 ) becomes a constant and this results trivially . </S>",
    "<S> physically , @xmath59 should depend on the parameters of the collision , namely on the angle of approach @xmath46 and on the time - scale for the exchange of ends between the two strings </S>",
    "<S> . determining @xmath59 would then require the detailed knowledge of the dynamics of the collision , which is unknown . in what follows we will , therefore , leave it as a free parameter and study the effect of its variation upon @xmath60 .    </S>",
    "<S> the distance @xmath67 corresponds to the separation at which the kinetic energy should match the potential energy exactly . because we expect expression ( 16 ) to break down at distances smaller than the coherence length of the scalar field </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we take it to be @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this condition allows the system to scatter before the two segments are brought back together , under the effect of the interactions . </S>",
    "<S> it should also correspond to a value close to the maximum of the interaction energy , since , for smaller separations , it was shown numerically @xcite that it should remain approximately constant as the separation vanishes , at least for @xmath4 not too far from unity .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows a plot of the dependence of the binding velocity , @xmath60 , on @xmath4 for four values of @xmath46 and @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> we see the strong dependence on the angle of approach @xmath46 . in particular for orthogonal strings we expect the contribution from the potential energy to almost vanish and the system will be free . for intermediate angles , </S>",
    "<S> however , the binding velocity , @xmath60 can be naturally in the range of @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> the actual value depends quite sensitively on @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 a ) , b ) , c ) show the dependence of the binding velocity on @xmath4 and @xmath59 for @xmath71 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the velocity on the angle of approach is shown in figure 5 , for @xmath72 and five values of @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular it becomes clear that the velocities only converge to a negligible value for @xmath46 close to @xmath74 . for intermediate angles </S>",
    "<S> the variation is relatively small allowing for a large range of parameters for which the velocity is relativistic .    </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , one wants to relate the binding velocity ( 19 ) with the approach velocity of two typical strings in the network . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the collision needs to be reasonably inelastic , since otherwise the system could be trivially time - reversed , resulting in configurations with the strings at the same separation and speed before and after the collision . </S>",
    "<S> one way of parameterising this is by the use of an efficiency parameter , @xmath75 , in the following way . just before the two zeros of the scalar field superimpose , for very small separation </S>",
    "<S> , we have argued that the system s energy should be essentially kinetic . </S>",
    "<S> then the same follows for the configuration just after the collision . </S>",
    "<S> however , the incoming energy will be channeled to all possible modes of an @xmath24 vortex , among which is the one corresponding to the separation of the two @xmath52 vortices . </S>",
    "<S> we then take @xmath75 to be the ratio between the initial and final ( kinetic ) energies , in the separation mode , before and after the collision . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , results in a relation between the initial and final velocities , before and after the collision @xmath77 where , @xmath78 will be taken to be the above @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> once thus computed , @xmath79 can be related to a velocity at a given separation by taking the effect of the interactions into account , for a given spatial configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the typical velocity quoted for a network of cosmic strings @xcite is about @xmath80 .    </S>",
    "<S> our estimates depend quite sensitively on two undetermined parameters @xmath59 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> their values can , in principle , be found by looking at simulations or by solving the short distance dynamics of strings more exactly analytically . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath59 and @xmath75 then turn out to be large , only a very small fraction of all collisions will have a `` zipper '' as the outcome . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent collisions of these configurations with other strings may lead to the peeling or `` unzipping '' of these higher winding number bridges as was shown in simulations by laguna and matzner @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as such the difference between the evolution of such a network and those evolving under the effect of intercommuting alone , should be negligible . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently low values of @xmath59 and @xmath75 , however , we have shown that a large fraction of all collisions of strings in the network would lead to local higher winding number bridges that could grow as `` zippers '' . </S>",
    "<S> the overall evolution of such a network can then be considerably different . in principle loop formation under these circumstances could still occur , at the same rate , but such loops would remain connected to their mother string . </S>",
    "<S> this should have an effect on their subsequent evolution .    a network of type i strings </S>",
    "<S> can then be richer in string configurations than one which evolves simply by intercommuting at every collision . </S>",
    "<S> this should have consequences for the evolution of the characteristic lengths in a string network , which , in turn , could reflect in the way strings seed energy distribution anisotropies , hopefully with potentially observable consequences both in structure in the universe and anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation . </S>"
