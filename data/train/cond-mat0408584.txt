    ", this problem is quite subtle : for example , the asymptotic behaviour of the @xmath1-particle density for one- and two - dimensional systems has only recently been computed @xcite .",
    "recently there has been renewed interest @xcite in this reaction , stimulated in part by the advent of both new numerical methods @xcite and new analytical techniques @xcite .",
    "the main focus of interest in this system has traditionally been the computation of the time - dependence of the @xmath1-particle density @xcite .",
    "note that , since the @xmath1-particles are independent , this computation is equivalent to the computation of the survival probability , @xmath14 , of a single @xmath1-particle moving in a sea of @xmath2 particles . in the case of one space dimension , to which this paper is devoted , @xmath14 is known to decay asymptotically as @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "recently , by a combination of bounding arguments , the constant @xmath16 was determined exactly @xcite : @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath4 are the density and diffusion constant respectively of the @xmath2-particles .",
    "note that the constant @xmath16 does _ not _ depend on the @xmath1-particle diffusion constant , @xmath3 , and the leading asymptotic result is the same as for a stationary @xmath1-particle .",
    "a parallel advance in algorithmic methods @xcite has enabled very long simulations of the model , especially in one dimension @xcite , in which @xmath14 can be made arbitrarily small ( of order @xmath19 , say , in reasonable computer time ) . remarkably , the predicted asymptotic decay is not observed in simulations even for these very small values of @xmath14 , motivating a study of the preasymptotic behaviour . in a companion paper @xcite , we have employed a path - integral approach @xcite to compute , for small ratio @xmath20 of diffusion constants , the leading correction to the asymptotic form quoted above . including this term gives reasonable agreement with data .    in the present paper",
    "we address , within the path - integral formalism , a different aspect of the problem . specifically , we study the spatial fluctuations , @xmath21 , of the @xmath1-particle averaged over the surviving trajectories at time @xmath11 .",

    "the statistical properties of the @xmath1 particle are calculated by averaging over the trajectories , where each trajectory is weighted with its survival probability multiplied by its brownian weight . in this way one obtains the action functional @xcite @xmath42 = \\frac{1}{4d_a}\\int_0^t d\\tau\\ , \\left(\\frac{d{z}}{d\\tau}\\right)^2 + \\mu[{z}],\\ ] ] which defines an effective dynamics for surviving @xmath1 particle trajectories @xcite .",

    "to compute the probability distribution @xmath54 , therefore , it is sufficient to find the classical path @xmath55 , i.e.  the path of least action .",

    "further supporting data will be presented in the following section .",
    "it is worth noting that , in this context , there is nothing special about the fluctuations of the mid - point of a closed path .",
    "for example , we can consider the mean square fluctuation , @xmath129 , along the path .",
    "using the usual fourier expansion one readily obtains @xmath130 this quantity will also scale as @xmath131 ( i.e.  the root - mean square fluctuation grows as @xmath132 ) as can be checked explicitly within the diagonal approximation . as a further twist",
    ", we can consider the fluctuations at time @xmath47 , or the root - mean square fluctuation over the whole path , of _ all _ trajectories that survive until time @xmath11 .",
    "these both scale at @xmath132 in contrast to the fluctuation of the end - point of the path which , as we have seen , grows as @xmath46 .    that the fluctuations of the trajectory at time @xmath47 , for paths which survive to time @xmath11 , could be larger than the fluctuations at time @xmath47 of paths which survive till time @xmath47 has the following intuitive explanation .",
    "trajectories which survive for a long time arise predominantly from initial configurations of the @xmath2 particles in which the @xmath1 particle is initially in a large region devoid of @xmath2 particles .",
    "if the @xmath1 particle is to survive until time @xmath11 , this region is larger than if it only has to survive until time @xmath47 , so the fluctuations in its position at time @xmath47 are expected to be larger in the former case than in the latter .",
    "numerical simulation data were obtained for both the unconstrained average @xmath133 and the average @xmath134 corresponding to surviving trajectories that return to the origin at time @xmath11 .",
    "the data were generated using the lattice - based algorithm of mehra and grassberger @xcite , which is readily adapted to the constrained case .",
    "the basic algorithm calculates the survival probability , averaged over all @xmath2-particle initial conditions and trajectories , of a given @xmath1-particle trajectory .",

    "this procedure generates the ensemble of closed paths with the required weights .",
    "the parameter values used were @xmath137 and @xmath138 . in both cases",
    "we divide the root - mean - square value of the displacement by @xmath46 and by @xmath132 to test the different predictions for the two types of average .",

    "a linear fit on a log - log plot gives an exponent @xmath140 , consistent with the predicted value of @xmath12 .",
    "the unconstrained data also show an increasing trend , but there is a suggestion that the slope is decreasing at later times  the prediction @xmath10 requires that these data eventually reach a plateau as @xmath141 .",
    "a linear fit , on a log - log plot , gives @xmath142 over this range .",
    "the companion figure 4 , in which the data are scaled by @xmath132 , tells a similar story .",
    "the closed - path data are consistent with @xmath143 , but the data including all paths show a clear decrease with time , indicative of a smaller exponent .",
    "effective exponent @xmath144 for all paths and for closed paths , plotted against @xmath145 . ]    to explore this behaviour in more detail , we have computed a time - dependent effective exponent , @xmath144 . for the computation we use the full data set , of which",
    "only a small subset ( of the ` all paths ' data ) is displayed in figs .   3 and 4 .",
    "the total time interval is divided into consecutive bins of size @xmath146 .",
    "the average value of @xmath133 is computed in each bin to smooth the data prior to taking a numerical derivative . the effective exponent , @xmath147 , at time @xmath148 is approximated by the difference between the logarithms of the average value for bins @xmath149 and @xmath150 divided by the difference of the logarithms of the average positions of bins @xmath149 and @xmath150 . the result of this procedure is shown in fig .  5 .",
    "the effective exponent is noisy , but is clearly decreasing with increasing time in a manner consistent with the predicted limiting value of @xmath139 . the equivalent data for the closed paths is also shown . in this case , however , there are no more data available beyond that shown in figures 3 and 4  the simulations are computationally expensive due to the requirement that the paths return to the origin at time @xmath11 . as a result , each bin contains a single data point , and the effective exponent is necessarily very noisy , but consistent with @xmath143 .",
    "we have studied the scaling properties of the spatial fluctuations of a diffusing particle interacting with diffusing traps , using the effective action arising from eliminating the trap degrees of freedom .",
    "the presence of the trapping process renders the fluctuations in the position of surviving particles subdiffusive , @xmath151 , with an amplitude that is independent of the @xmath1-particle diffusion constant , @xmath3 .",
    "we have also found that the fluctuations at ` half - time ' of surviving trajectories that return to the origin at time @xmath11 scale with a different exponent @xmath152 . as a cautionary note",
    "we recall that both of these results were obtained by using the quadratic approximation to the action functional , which is strictly valid only in the limit @xmath153 .",
    "it remains an open question to what extent corrections to the quadratic approximation can modify the results for general values of @xmath20 . in view of the reasonable qualitative agreement of the theory with numerical data for the case @xmath154 , however , we expect any modifications to be quantitative rather than qualitative .",
