    "in 1975 , takahashi and umezawa@xcite proposed a formalism based on operators called thermofield dynamics ( tfd ) in order to describe quantum field theory at finite temperature by means of a structure of hilbert space .",
    "this approach was not totally new since a similar idea appeared in a paper by araki and woods , in 1963 , considering the case of a free boson gas@xcite .",
    "takahashi and umezawa s approach is an alternative to the density operator formalism in quantum statistical mechanics proposed by landau@xcite and von neumann@xcite@xmath0@xcite in 1925 and to the finite temperature quantum field theory proposed by matsubara in 1955@xcite .",
    "in fact , tfd is an operator - algebraic approach to quantum statistical mechanics@xcite and a real time formalism to finite temperature quantum field theory@xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients of tfd are the doubling of freedom degrees in the hilbert space @xmath1 which describes the physical system and the building of a finite temperature vacuum , called hereafter thermofield vacuum , by means of a bogoliubov transformation realized in the zero temperature vacuum state defined into the hilbert space @xmath2 , also called liouville space @xcite@xmath0@xcite , where the space @xmath3 is constructed by means of a tilde conjugation rule @xmath4@xcite .",
    "this procedure is made in such a way that the expectation value of any operator from @xmath1 in the thermofield vacuum coincides with the statistical mean value .",
    "tfd approach has been largely applied in the study of finite temperature systems , from high energy physics @xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite to quantum optics @xcite@xmath0 @xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite and condensed matter physics @xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite , in different contexts as gauge theories @xcite , anderson model@xcite , renormalization group@xcite , casimir effect@xcite@xmath0@xcite , string field theory@xcite , supersimmetry@xcite , noncommutative theories@xcite@xmath0@xcite , non - classical states@xcite , thermal and quantum fluctuations@xcite , master equations@xcite , among others @xcite .",
    "however , quantum information theory was not still explored in a tfd context , although its potential to deal with quantum information protocols in systems at finite temperature @xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite .    in quantum information",
    "the storage properties of qubits from quantum computers in comparison to bits from classical computers can be viewed as a result of a hilbert space structure in quantum mechanics , that leads in the quantum computer case to strong processing results@xcite@xmath0@xcite . in this sense",
    ", we can also explore the hilbert state structure from tfd approach in order to trace some parallels with achievements from quantum information .",

    "we discuss the relation between the no - cloning theorem and the doubling procedure used in the formalism of tfd .",
    "we also discuss how to apply the no - cloning theorem in the context of thermofield states defined in tfd .",
    "consequences associated to states in @xmath2 , mixed states , von neumann entropy and thermofield vacuum are also addressed .    in order to clarify notation and subject , in the next section we review some basic aspects of tfd approach .",
    "consider an operator @xmath5 acting on a hilbert space @xmath1 generated by fock states @xmath6 .",
    "its expectation value in a given ensemble is expressed by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density operator in the corresponding ensemble . in thermofield dynamics",
    "this expectation value is evaluated by means of the definition of a thermofield vacuum @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , giving the same result as statistical approach , i.e. , @xmath11 as a consequence , the thermal vaccuum state @xmath12 is associated to the density operator @xmath8 .",
    "for this reason we need to describe it in a hilbert space larger than the hilbert space @xmath1 generated by the fock states @xmath6 .",
    "then , the thermofield vacuum @xmath12 is not a vector state in the hilbert space @xmath1 described by the fock states @xmath6 , but a state in another enlarged hilbert space @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hilbert space conjugated to @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , in order to describe @xmath13 as a vector state , we need to double the degrees of freedom of the hilbert space @xmath1 by a formal procedure named tilde conjugation @xcite , creating the space @xmath2 .    in order to construct the thermofield vacuum in the space @xmath2 ,",
    "let us suppose we can describe @xmath14 in terms of the fock state basis @xmath6 and unknown vectors @xmath15 by means of the following expansion @xmath16 the next step is to find the form of the unkown vectors @xmath17 such that the relation ( [ evt ] ) turns out to be true .",
    "consider the system described by a thermal equilibrium density matrix @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the partition function and the energy spectrum @xmath20 of the hamiltonian @xmath21 , @xmath22 then the expectation value of @xmath5 in ( [ med ] ) can be written as @xmath23 we can also write the same in terms of @xmath12 by using equations ( [ med ] ) , ( [ evt ] ) and the assumption that @xmath5 does not act on @xmath24 vectors , @xmath25 comparing equations ( [ rodado ] ) and ( [ somado ] ) , we find @xmath26 thus , by defining the fock states @xmath27 a basis product can be given to @xmath2 and we can write @xmath24 vectors as @xmath28 the vector in equation ( [ vec1 ] ) satisfy the conditions ( [ med ] ) and ( [ evt ] ) and we can finally express the thermofield vacuum in terms of @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we distinguish them by putting a tilde on top of a capital letter , e.g. , @xmath31 . in tfd ,",
    "tilde conjugation rules @xcite realize a mapping between @xmath5 operators acting on @xmath6 and @xmath31 acting on @xmath32 .",

    "we have the following properties to a given temperature @xmath48 , @xmath67 it follows that @xmath68 and @xmath69 , given by equations ( [ lyiul2 ] ) and ( [ lyiul4 ] ) , are annihilation operators to the thermofield vacuum and justify the term vacuum . on the other hand , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , given by equations ( [ lyiul1 ] ) and ( [ lyiul3 ] ) ,",
    "excite the thermofield vacuum generating excited thermofield states . since the bogoliubov transformation is canonical ,",
    "the corresponding commutations for bosons or anticommutations for fermions are preserved @xcite .",
    "although this discussion of tfd is restricted to the more simple formulation in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xcite , an elaborate discussion could include more specific treatments as based on schwinger operators@xcite , gauge fields@xcite , supersimmetry@xcite or the approach on phase space@xcite",
    ". these can be useful in more specific situations , as , for instance , spin 1/2 particles in a lattice@xcite , higgs mechanism @xcite or in the approach to wigner functions@xcite .",
    "we also point out that , in more specific cases , @xmath55 in the bogoliubov transformation @xmath52 and the thermofield vacuum @xmath14 can be more elaborate than ( [ adk ] ) and ( [ bog ] ) .",
    "now , as a simple example in this discussion , consider a fermionic oscillator , described by the hamiltonian @xmath21 @xmath72 and the corresponding anticommutation relations @xmath73 we can also define @xmath74 this operator is hermitean @xmath75 and gives the time evolution of an operator @xmath5 by means of a liouville - von neumann equation @xcite .",

    ", the thermofield vacuum is always associated to a mixed state in @xmath1 .",
    "the fact of @xmath14 be related to a mixed state in @xmath1 is an important feature to be considered .",
    "indeed , superpositions in the space @xmath1 have a different role from superpositions states in the space @xmath2 , because in this higher space the effect of non - separability will reflect in @xmath1 the existence of @xmath3 .",
    "as an illustration , consider the following superposition state @xmath102 where @xmath103 is given by ( [ angulo ] ) .",
    "the density matrix associated to ( [ sis ] ) is given by @xmath104 we can calculate the von neumann entropy for the state ( [ sis ] ) by means of its associate density matrix ( [ sis2 ] ) @xmath105 this means that it is a pure state @xcite@xmath0@xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "this could also be verified from a more simple relation @xmath106 on the other hand , the density matrix corresponding to the thermofield vacuum of the fermionic oscillator , eq .",

    "then , in the space @xmath2 generated in tfd , superpositions are associated to density matrices in the hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "a non - factorable state in @xmath2 is associated to a mixed state in @xmath1 . from quantum optics , it is known that two - mode squeezing operators lead to generation of an entangled state when acting in a two - mode vacuum@xcite .",
    "this is the case of the bogoliubov transformation acting in the zero temperature vacuum @xmath113 that leads to the thermofield vacuum @xmath114 .",
    "suppose a cloning machine in a state @xmath115 and a state that we wish to clone , e.g. , the state @xmath6 .",
    "then , the cloning process can be represented by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the final state of the machine and @xmath118 is the final state where now we have two states @xmath6 .    in this process",
    "the hilbert space generated by the fock state @xmath6 is increased to a product space generated by @xmath118 .",

    "this result was proved in 1982 by wooters and zurek @xcite and by dieks in another way @xcite .",
    "now , we turn to the tfd procedure of doubling the degrees of freedom in the hilbert space @xmath1 . this procedure can be summarized by the following mapping @xmath128 this mapping works in this way : given a state @xmath129 , a state @xmath130 is created such that @xmath131 can be expressed by @xmath132 there is no unique way of doubling the degrees of freedom of a hilbert space ( see figure [ doughbli ] ) . as such , we need to make a choice . indeed , given states @xmath129 , the doubling can be realized by means of a cloning procedure , where a cloning of @xmath133 is created in the tilde space @xmath3 and called @xmath134 .",

    "let us consider the strict case of a cloning mapping ( [ cdtfd ] ) , where fock states are considered , such that from the state @xmath6 , we have @xmath147 now , by considering a superposition state @xmath148 , this doubling mapping can be written as @xmath149 or @xmath150 the state @xmath151 corresponds to a copy of @xmath152 in the space @xmath3 . the complex numbers @xmath37 and @xmath38 could go as complex conjugated in the tilde space , depending on our choice of the mapping .",

    "can not be a linear mapping .",
    "this leads to a more strong result : we can not devise an experiment by means of linear operations that lead to a doubling procedure in tfd to an arbitrary state @xmath152 .    as the states @xmath164",
    "are factorable in @xmath2 and can not result of a linear operation , we have as a particular consequence , they do not result from unitary evolution or any linear evolution .",
    "this can give us some route to deal with non - factorable states in @xmath2 corresponding to thermofield states associated to physical states in @xmath1 .",
    "this result is of practical interest because a non - factorable state in @xmath2 acts as an entanglement between @xmath1 and @xmath3 , consequently can not be associated to a pure state in @xmath1 , but only to a mixed state in @xmath1 .",
    "however , the above result is not too much serious in the derivation of the thermofield vacuum .",
    "indeed , a recipe to construct the thermofield vacuum is given by the following steps @xmath165 ) corresponds to the case @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath166 , where the equality ( [ ndulhsd ] ) is true .",
