    "studying the sub - structures of nuclei and nucleons , encoded either in elastic electromagnetic form factors or deep inelastic structure functions , has been a field of continued interest in nuclear and particle physics . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the aspect of nucleon substructure in connection with the appearance and relevance of electromagnetic form factors in nuclear physics .",
    "we shall calculate the electromagnetic contributions to the binding energies of loosely bound neutron - nucleus systems , arising due to the neutron form factors .",
    "such systems are realized by the deuteron and the one - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "recently , the availability of radioactive beams opened up the possibility to study the structure of unstable nuclei .",
    "such experiments @xcite revealed neutron rich nuclei whose spatial extensions are very large as compared to the range of the nuclear force .",
    "these so - called  halo \" nuclei consist of very loosely bound valence neutrons which tunnel to distances far from the remaining set of nucleons . such nuclei can be viewed as a system of a  core \" with normal nuclear density and a low density halo of one or more neutrons .",
    "thus one expects that the neutrons in the halo do not experience the strong force due to individual nucleons in the core but rather interact with the core as a whole .",
    "based on this understanding , many few body models have been constructed and elaborately refined over the past few years @xcite in order to explain a variety of experimental data .",
    "it is well known by now that the neutron does have structure and hence an electric charge distribution which can be measured in elastic electron - nucleon scattering experiments .",
    "the interest in this field was revived due to the new experimental results on the nucleon form factor from the jefferson laboratory @xcite .",
    "considering the recent interest in nucleon form factors along with the experimental advances being made in halo nuclear studies , we found it timely to investigate the role of the neutron structure in the deuteron and one - neutron halo nuclei . in",
    "what follows , we shall derive an expression for the electromagnetic potential between the neutron and a charged particle ( generalizing hereby the breit equation by adding to it the finite size corrections ) and then apply it to determine the perturbative corrections to the binding energy of nuclei .",
    "there exists a well known prescription for obtaining a potential from quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the method consists of taking the fourier transform of a non - relativistic scattering amplitude , say @xmath9 , for a scattering process of the type @xmath10",
    ". since the method is completely general , one can handle simple cases with an amplitude which corresponds to one or two particle exchange diagrams or consider more complicated cases where the amplitude needs to be calculated using higher order corrections in the perturbative feynman - dyson expansion .",
    "if the amplitude depends only on the magnitude of momentum transfer ( @xmath11 ) in the process , then the fourier transform to obtain the potential , @xmath12 , reduces to @xcite : @xmath13 obviously , if @xmath14 ( non - relativistic propagator of a massless particle ) , the potential is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "some examples of exotic potentials derived from quantum field theory can be found in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to study the role of the neutron structure in neutron - charged particle interactions .",
    "hence we shall be interested in obtaining an electromagnetic potential which describes the interaction between the charged particle and the neutron . to obtain this potential",
    ", we shall start with the scattering amplitude for the process @xmath16 , where @xmath17 can be any charged particle with charge @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 a positive integer ) .",
    "we shall consider two cases : the neutron ( spin 1/2 ) + a ( spin 1/2 ) and neutron ( spin 1/2 ) + a ( spin 0 ) case with the former being relevant for the neutron - proton system ( deuteron ) and the latter for the one - neutron halo @xmath4be taken as a neutron plus a @xmath5be core in the @xmath20-state .",
    "mathematically , the complete spin-@xmath21 fermion vertex ( fermion - photon - fermion ) is given as @xcite : @xmath22 where the sub - structure of the fermion is contained in the various form factors , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "@xmath25 is the four - momentum carried by the photon ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is the mass of the fermion and the @xmath28 s are the usual dirac matrices @xcite .",
    "the four - momentum squared , @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 is the energy and @xmath31 the three momentum ) , reduces in the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath32 ) to @xmath33 .",
    "the above four form factors appear in the expression for the cross section for electron - nucleon elastic scattering and the nucleon form factors are thus extracted from such scattering experiments .",
    "the first form factor , @xmath34 is connected to the charge distribution inside the nucleon and @xmath35 the total charge of the nucleon .",
    "the form factors @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are related to the anomalous magnetic moment , electric dipole and zeldovich anapole moment , respectively . in what follows ,",
    "we shall obtain the electromagnetic potential for the spin-1/2 - spin-1/2 and the spin-1/2 - spin-0 case in terms of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors @xmath39 and @xmath40 as the other form factors ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) are related to the weak interaction and their effects are small .",
    "being the number of protons.,width=453,height=302 ]    in order to perform a complete calculation of the potential , we turn to the task of expanding the amplitude in @xmath43 terms , thereby generalizing the breit equation @xcite by the inclusion of two electromagnetic form factors .",

    "given the low binding energies of the one - neutron halos and the fact that in the standard picture , the valence neutron resides far from the remaining core , one could naturally ask the question , does the electromagnetic interaction play some role apart from the strong interaction which is not so strong as in normal nuclei ?",
    "the answer is that the electromagnetic corrections viewed as a ratio to the corresponding binding energies are of the same order of magnitude in the case of the deuteron and the one - neutron halo provided we treat the latter as a neutron interacting with the rest of the nucleus ( we mentioned already that this is in the same spirit as the calculation done for the strong interaction part ) .",
    "the strength of the electromagnetic potential between the neutron and the core depends on the number of protons in the core .",
    "hence , such a correction in the case of the one - neutron halo @xmath144c would be larger ; more so due to the fact that the binding energy of the @xmath144c can be smaller @xmath145 mev @xcite .",
