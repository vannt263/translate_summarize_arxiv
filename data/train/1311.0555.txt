    "since majorana fermions , particles which are their own antiparticles , are proposed theoretically in topological superconductors,@xcite the search of majorana fermions has attracted much attention in the condensed matter community .",
    "apart from the importance for fundamental physics , majorana modes in topological superconductors are of great use for quantum computation due to their non - abelian exchange statistics.@xcite    a promising proposal for engineering majorana quasiparticles is based on a semiconductor nanowire with both spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and magnetic field in the proximity of an s - wave superconductor.@xcite in a long one - dimensional nanowire , in which only the lowest subband is involved , majorana modes emerge as one pair of zero - energy states located at the two ends of the nanowire in the parameter regime satisfying the condition @xmath4.@xcite here @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the zeeman splitting induced by the magnetic field , proximity - induced superconducting gap and chemical potential , respectively . a characteristic feature of majorana states is the conductance peak at zero bias.@xcite the value of this zero - bias peak is predicted to be quantized , i.e. , @xmath8 for a normal - superconductor surface@xcite and @xmath9 for a normal - superconductor - normal ( nsn ) structure , as the nsn structure consists of two normal - superconductor surfaces.@xcite when the length of wire is comparable or shorter than the coherence length of majorana modes , the interaction between the two end majorana modes becomes important and leads to an energy splitting of these states.@xcite this effect can reduce the value of the zero - bias peak and can even make this peak split into two peaks at finite bias when the splitting is large enough.@xcite    there are also a few works on majorana fermions in multi - subband nanowires.@xcite this system supports multiple low - energy modes at each ends .",
    "the number of these modes @xmath1 is determined by the @xmath10 topological invariant , which comes from the approximate chiral symmetry.@xcite in the weak superconducting - pairing limit , @xmath1 is approximately equal to the number of the subbands in which only the states with one kind of spin are occupied.@xcite without considering the soc between different transverse subbands , the chiral symmetry is exact , and hence all the low - energy modes at the ends are the majorana modes in the long - wire limit . nevertheless , taking account of the inter - subband soc , the chiral symmetry is weakly broken , and most of the low - energy modes are split off and",
    "become the near - zero - energy modes .",
    "the number of the left majorana modes is determined by the @xmath11 topological invariant , which corresponds to the parity of @xmath1.@xcite in the nontrivial ( trivial ) topological regime with odd ( even ) @xmath1 , there is one ( no ) majorana mode at each end .",
    "the presence of the majorana mode for odd @xmath1 is also according to the restriction from the particle - hole symmetry of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian .",
    "when the splittings of these low - energy modes are still negligible compared with the energy broadening from the leads , the near - zero - energy modes behave the same as the majorana modes .",
    "thus , the conductance still shows a peak at zero bias with peak value being @xmath2 in an nsn structure .",
    "however , when the splitting induced by the inter - subband soc becomes important , the behavior of the conductance becomes complex due to the interference between different low - energy modes and the zero - bias conductance can vary between 0 and @xmath2.@xcite    so far , all works in this field focus on the two - terminal majorana nanowire .",
    "there is no report on the three - terminal majorana nanostructure , eg . , the @xmath0-shaped semiconductor nanostructure with the rashba soc and magnetic field in the proximity of superconductor .",
    "in fact , the three - terminal @xmath0-shaped structure built with normal conductor has been extensively investigated and shows very distinct electric and transport properties . in particular",
    ", a localized state appears at the intersection of the three - terminal structure and induces the fano line shape in the bias dependence of the conductance.@xcite thus , it is expected that there are also some interesting features in the @xmath0-shaped majorana nanostructure .",
    "furthermore , the unique property of this system can be shown in a simple view .",
    "we take the case where both the main - arm and side - arm are one - dimensional chains as an example . due to similarity of the hamiltonian around the ends of the @xmath0-shaped majorana nanostructure and nanowire",
    ", the majorana modes should appear at all three ends of the @xmath0-shaped nanostructure in the nontrivial topological regime .",
    "thus , the total number of zero - energy end states is three .",
    "however , it is known that majorana modes must emerge in pairs , since one majorana fermion only contains half the degrees of freedom of a normal fermion.@xcite therefore , an additional unknown majorana mode must exist . the main purpose of this work is to identify this additional majorana mode and reveal its influence on the transport through the @xmath0-shaped majorana nanostructure .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate the low - energy spectrum and transport properties of a @xmath0-shaped majorana nanostructure .",
    "we discover that , distinct from the behavior in nanowires , where all majorana modes appear at the two ends , a majorana mode shows up at the intersection of the three - terminal @xmath0-shaped structure in the case with odd low - energy modes ( including the zero - energy and near - zero - energy modes ) at the three ends .",
    "however , neither majorana nor near - zero - energy mode appears at the intersection in the case with even low - energy modes at the three ends .",
    "we further show that , the presence of the intersection majorana mode enhances the deviation of the zero - bias conductance from its ideal value in the long - arm limit . also considering that the regime with the intersection majorana mode can appear at lower magnetic field compared to that without it ,",
    "the deviation from the ideal value tends to decrease with the increase of magnetic field in this case .",
    "this behavior is also distinct from the transport property through a majorana nanowire , where the deviation always shows increasing trend with increasing magnetic field.@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we plot @xmath121 and @xmath122 as function of magnetic field for different arm lengths in fig .",
    "[ fig_conduct2](a ) .",
    "we first discuss the case in the long - arm limit , i.e. , @xmath123 . as @xmath85 and @xmath98",
    "coincide in this case , only @xmath85 is shown .",
    "it is seen that the linear conductance is very close to the ideal value @xmath2 in all parameter regimes investigated in this work .",
    "this indicates that the splitting of the relevant low - energy modes is negligible compared with their self - energies .",
    "the behavior becomes more interesting for shorter arm length . in the case with @xmath124 , both @xmath85 and @xmath98 take the ideal value @xmath2 in the regimes for @xmath46 , 2 and 4 , however , deviate much from their ideal value for @xmath56 .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood as follows . as said above , in the regime for odd @xmath1 , the intersection majorana mode emerges , which enhances the discrepancy between the zero - bias conductance and its ideal value .",
    "it is also known that , with the increasing magnetic field , the coherence length of the low - energy modes tends to increase , and hence the splitting of these states tends to increase.@xcite therefore , the pronounced deviation from the ideal value appears in the regime for @xmath56 , in which @xmath1 is odd and the corresponding magnetic field is high .",
    "it is also shown that the deviation in @xmath98 is larger than @xmath85 .",
    "this can be understood by considering the magnitude of the wave function of the intersection majorana mode in the side - arm is larger than that in the main - arm , as shown in its analytic solution with @xmath25 [ eqs .",
    "( [ wave_center_1])-([wave_center_3 ] ) ] .",
    "note that the deviation from the ideal value in the regime for @xmath56 is even larger than that for @xmath125 , although the latter one appears at higher magnetic field .",
    "similar phenomenon is observed in the case with @xmath126 . in that case",
    ", one finds that the derivation for @xmath46 is larger than that for @xmath53 .",
    "the above behaviors are very distinct from those in majorana nanowires . in that system , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_conduct2](b ) , the deviation from the ideal value always tends to increase with the increase of magnetic field due to the decrease of the coherence length .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated the majorana fermions in a @xmath0-shaped semiconductor nanostructure with the rashba soc and proximity - induced superconducting pairing in the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of this structure .",
    "we first discuss the low - energy spectrum of this system .",
    "we find that the properties of the low - energy modes ( including the majorana and near - zero - energy modes ) at the ends of the @xmath0-shaped structure are similar to those in the majorana nanowire .",
    "the number of the low - energy modes at each end @xmath1 is approximately equal to the number of the subbands in which only the states with one kind of spin are occupied and the number of the majorana modes at each end is one ( zero ) for odd ( even ) @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , very distinct from the nanowire , it is discovered that one majorana mode appears at the intersection of the @xmath0-shaped structure in the case with odd @xmath1 to ensure that the total number of the majorana modes is even .",
    "however , there is neither majorana nor near - zero - energy mode at the intersection for even @xmath1 .",
    "we also investigate the transport properties through the above @xmath0-shaped nanostructure with each end connected with a normal lead .",
    "it is found that the deviation of the zero - bias conductance from its ideal value in the long - arm limit @xmath2 is more pronounced in the regime for odd @xmath1 compared to the one for even @xmath1 .",
    "this is because the presence of the intersection majorana mode reduces the distance between the adjoining majorana modes and the self - energy of this intersection mode from the leads is very small .",
    "moreover , the regime for odd @xmath1 can appear at lower magnetic field than that for even one . therefore , around the boundary between these two regimes , the deviation from the ideal value tends to decrease with increasing magnetic field .",
    "this behavior is also very distinct from that in the nanowire , where the deviation from the ideal value always tends to increase with increasing magnetic field due to the decrease of the coherence length of the low - energy modes .",
