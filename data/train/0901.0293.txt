    "examples of superconductivity in graphite intercalated with alkali metals have been known for several decades@xcite .",
    "more recently the occurrence of superconductivity in graphite intercalation compounds ( gics ) has been linked to the partial occupation of the inter - layer band in those intercalated structures that display the superconducting phase transition@xcite .",
    "experimental studies of superconductivity in gics were limited to very low temperatures , since previously known gic superconductors , like kc@xmath7 or lic@xmath8 , display low superconducting transition temperatures under ambient conditions .",
    "the synthesis of 6 , with a surprisingly high superconducting transition temperature@xcite of 11.5k , has spurred new research in the area of gic superconductivity .",
    "in addition to encouraging new experiments , this development calls for expanding theoretical models to explain its high",
    ". 6 further merits special attention among simple graphite derived compounds because it illustrates how the properties of graphene sheets are altered by the change in crystal symmetry and in electronic band structure due to interaction with the ca sublattice .",
    "the 6 structure is shown in fig.[fig : cac6str]_a_. it belongs to the space group nr.166 ( -3 m ) with an @xmath9 stacking sequence which sets it apart from all other known 1st stage gic compounds @xcite . here",

    "its inversion center lies in the middle of the graphitic hexagon in the median plane .",
    "fractional contribution of ca atoms at the corners of the unit cell adds up to one atom per unit cell .",
    "6 and its parent graphene structure are intuitively comparable . introducing ca atoms inbetween the carbon sheets lowers the symmetry of the d@xmath11 space group of graphene to the d@xmath12 space group .",
    "this leads to a unit cell in 6 with a hexagonal cross - section area in the _ ab_-plane that is three times larger than that of graphene , and a corresponding brillouin zone ( bz ) that is three times smaller .",
    "the bz of graphene and 6 are rotated by @xmath13 in respect to each other , thus when the graphene bz is folded into that of 6 the equivalent k and k@xmath14 points fall back onto the @xmath15 point . when comparing the phonon dispersion of graphene and 6",
    "the 21 phonon branches in 6 can be derived approximately from 6 graphene phonon branches folded into the smaller 6 bz , resulting in @xmath16 branches , in addition to the three phonon branches from the ca sublattice .     and the mirror planes @xmath17 . the three - fold rotational axis that coincides with the six - fold rotation - reflection axis goes vertically through the paper at the point of the intersection of the c@xmath8 axes in the central hexagon .",

    "contrary to this finding , however , based on evidence from isotope effect measurements@xcite it was the ca phonons that have been found to be primarily responsible for the mediation of superconductivity .",
    "lattice vibrations have also been the focus of spectroscopic investigations : a raman study directed at the zone center phonon modes@xcite and an inelastic x - ray ( ixr ) scattering study aimed at low - energy phonon branches@xcite .",
    "the raman study has recorded a raman active band at 1500 - 1 that has been assigned to the high - frequency e@xmath1 vibration by a rough raman shift coincidence with the theoretical prediction@xcite . since the frequency of this band is measured to be higher than 1447 - 1 corresponding to the zone center mode predicted by a frozen - phonon density functional calculation , it has been attempted to explain this discrepancy by non - adiabatic behavior@xcite .",
    "non - adiabatic effects are assumed to become important when a relatively short lattice vibration period is accompanied by a relatively long electron scattering time @xcite . in such a case the born oppenheimer approximation ( boa ) , which asserts that electrons remain in the ground state at all times in the process of the lattice vibration , is not applicable any more and excitations of the electron cloud to higher states as a consequence of electron - phonon coupling need to be considered .",
    "the ixr study has traced two acoustic branches and one optical ca sublattice branch along the @xmath18l and @xmath18x directions finding good agreement with predictions by calandra and mauri@xcite barring a slight systematic underestimation of calculated band frequencies throughout the dispersion .",
    "the energy window of the x - ray study has been limited to energies up to 40mev and in both works some of the predicted modes have been absent in experimental data .",

    "in fact the phonon dispersion of graphite has been investigated by means of drrs in considerable detail @xcite . the so - called d band , a disorder induced feature appearing between 1300 - 1 and 1400 - 1 in graphite is also seen in 6 raman spectra in the same frequency range ;",

    "it is apparent that the interpretation of spectroscopic data is affected by sample quality and age .    while the body of work describing superconductivity in 6",
    "is quite substantial , there are discrepancies in the estimations of the magnitude of the sc gap by means of tunneling spectroscopies .",
    "the accounts vary from @xmath19 - 1 ( ref.@xcite ) to 37.1 - 1 ( ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the former value puts superconductivity in 6 into a weak coupling regime while the latter raises the possibility of strong coupling . a third scanning tunneling spectroscopy study ( ref.@xcite ) provides an intermediate value of 25.8 - 1 .",

    "the high - quality 6 crystals were synthesized by reacting highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( advanced ceramics , grade : zya ) with a molten alloy of li and ca at 350@xmath20c for several weeks @xcite .",
    "the resulting _ c_-oriented polycrystalline samples were characterized by x - ray diffraction , and susceptibility measurements . the samples for the raman study were carefully selected to have almost pure 6 phase with a minimal amount ( @xmath21 ) of impurity lic@xmath22 phase , and to show a very sharp superconducting transition ( @xmath23 0.1 k ) with the onset at @xmath6 = 11.4k .",
    "further details on the characterization of the samples can be found in ref .  @xcite .",
    "because of the sensitivity of the lustrous sample surface to moisture contained in air , the samples have been manipulated and mounted in argon atmosphere .",
    "the samples were then transferred to and cleaved in a he - filled glove box that was enclosing the continuous flow he - cryostat .",
    "the freshly cleaved specimen were then immediately cooled to 5k and hold below 20k at all times for the duration of the measurement .    to perform raman scattering from the _ ab_-plane of bulk 6 we have used a kr+ laser for a range of excitation wavelengths with 2mw power focused to a 50 x 100 @xmath24 m spot , an oxford instruments cryostat for sample temperature control down to 3k , and a custom triple - stage spectrometer .",
    "we have employed circularly polarized light with the optical configurations selecting either the same or opposite chirality .",
    "the former and the latter are respectively referred to as right - right ( rr ) and right - left ( rl ) configurations .",

    "we believe that we observe a disorder induced band instead of the actual zone center mode . the raman active a@xmath36 mode expected around 1380 - 1 is not observed .",
    "our assignment of raman bands is summarized in table[tab : fitegsymm476 nm ] .",

    "besides the fundamental raman frequencies , spectra of 6 exhibit features well known from disordered graphites @xcite . these features",
    "are commonly labeled as d and g bands and are identified by the rough frequency regions where they appear : around 1300 - 1 for the d band and around 1600 - 1 for the g band .",
    "the d band is indicative of disorder in form of scattering centers as found in polycrystalline samples @xcite , in highly - oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) samples close to edges @xcite and in irradiated graphite @xcite .",

    "the position of the g band depends on doping of graphene sheets and on surface charges@xcite .",
    "we shall discuss the origin of the d and g band ( shown in fig - s[fig : cac6phon1 ] and [ fig : cac6phon2 ] ) in this section .",
    "the drrs process couples to the disorder induced d band making points of the phonon dispersion away from the bz center accessible by raman scattering . by employing two excitation wavelengths we measure two such points by means of the d band raman shift .",
    "more points in the phonon dispersion of 6 will be traced with the help of other ( weaker ) disorder induced raman bands .",
    "fig.[fig : cac6phon2 ] shows how the d band shifts from 1308 - 1 to 1332 - 1 according to the excitation energy change from 647 nm to 476 nm .",
    "this translates to a frequency shift rate of 35 - 1@xmath38ev in the visible light range of excitation energies in agreement with data presented in fig.1 of ref.@xcite",
    ". the observed frequency shift rate of the d band in 6 is specific to this compound and is less than the 50 - 1 frequency shift rate of the d band in graphite@xcite which allows to attribute the observed d band to be specifically due to the drrs in 6 , excluding the scenario that we might be observing the graphitic d band from deintercalated regions .",
    "the scheme for drrs in 6 ( fig.[fig : cac6dr]_a _ ) involves graphene - derived electronic bands .",
    "there is a sequence of four steps to this process : ( 1 ) following the absorption of the photon , an electron - hole pair is excited as a result of a real inter - band transition .",
    "this event occurs at the band wave vector _ k _ in the bz , where the inter - band separation energy matches the excitation energy as indicated by a solid vertical arrow ( _ ab _ for the blue laser line ) .",
    "if considering high - symmetry directions in the 6 band structure , the inter - band transition for visible light is only possible at the wave vector _ * k * _ in the @xmath18 t direction of the rhombohedral bz .",
    "this is why we chose the electronic band structure and the phonon dispersion along @xmath18 t to approximate our calculation of the drrs effect in 6 .",
    "( 2 ) next , the electron encounters an intra - band transition in which it is inelastically scattered by a phonon of a finite wave vector _ * q * _ opposite to the direction of the solid diagonal arrow ( _ bc _",
    ", for the blue laser light ) that illustrates the electron transition .",
    "( 3 ) the electron is elastically scattered back across the bz ( _ cd _ ) by a defect to ( 4 ) recombine ( _ da _ ) with the hole in the valence band by emission of the raman shifted photon .",
    "fig.[fig : cac6dr]_a _ reveals two possible ways to inelastically scatter the electron in step2 of the drrs process : ( a ) across the t point into the neighboring bz between the two nonequivalent @xmath15 points , namely in the @xmath39 direction ( which is referred to as _ inter - valley _ scattering ) , or ( b ) across the @xmath15 point between the right and left branches of the conduction band parabola inside the same bz ( which is referred to as _ intra - valley _",
    "scattering ) .",
    "the d band frequency is determined by finding the phonon energy in the phonon dispersion that corresponds to the length of the phonon wave vector @xmath40__*q*__@xmath40 , which is set by the second drrs transition by either intra - valley or inter - valley scattering .",
    "fig.[fig : cac6dr]_b _ displays allowed drrs frequencies as a function of excitation energy .",
    "we call this function a _",
    "double resonance curve _ ; there is one curve for each phonon branch and the set of the double resonance curves is unique for any material .",
    "the double resonance curve is obtained in two steps : ( i ) we examine the 6 band structure and match the laser excitation energy to the electron wave vector _ * k * _ where the electron - hole pair creation can be accommodated by a corresponding energy separation between the electronic bands .",
    "this allows us to find the length of the phonon wave vector _ * q * _ involved in the inelastic scattering step of the drrs .",
    "( ii ) we read off the phonon energy @xmath41 in the phonon dispersion that corresponds to the * _ q_*-s obtained in the previous step for all possible excitation energies for selected phonon branches .",
    "the conclusion is three - fold:(1 ) for 6 there exists an activation threshold for the disorder induced drrs process at 1.1ev where the graphene derived conduction band crosses the fermi level .",
    "this is in difference to drrs in graphite where the first transition can in principle occur at arbitrary small excitation energies as a result of inter - band transitions between the dirac cones in the proximity of the k points of the hexagonal bz .",
    "( 2 ) because of the symmetry of the band structure the inter - valley and intra - valley scattering yield the same drrs frequencies in the approximation that the length of the phononic wave vector * _ q _ * ( which is the hypothenuse of the triangles bed and bdc ) is estimated by the horizontal lines de or dc , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the phonon wave vectors for inter - valley and intra - valley scattering respectively .",
    "@xmath44 , requiring extension of the phonon dispersion into the neighboring bz along @xmath45 . ] .",
    "( 3 ) the slope of the double resonance curves is positive for all three graphene derived phonon branches ( thick solid lines ) in the visible light range .",
    "thus we expect a positive ( blue ) shift of the d band when the excitation energy is increased from 647 nm to 476 nm .",
    "the frequencies of observed raman peaks are shown by symbols in fig.[fig : cac6dr]_b_. the position of the d band for the employed laser wavelengths is indicated by filled circles . considering the d band frequency range , its strong intensity and blue - shift of the d band with excitation energy ,",
    "the drrs characteristic displayed by the d band corresponds well to the double resonance curve derived from the lower e@xmath30 phonon branch .",
    "the experimental points are below the calculated curve by approximately 50 - 1 .",
    "we conclude that the d band in 6 originates from the lower e@xmath30 branch .",
    "the d band is depolarized because phase information of the incoming photon is lost in the process of intra - band relaxational scattering .",
    "this is true for any drrs induced band and thus two other depolarized features : at 1120 - 1 and at 440 - 1 ( labeled d@xmath46 and e@xmath47 ) may be interpreted as resulting from drrs .",
    "these modes are marked by small symbols at their respective frequencies in fig.[fig : cac6dr]_b _ and _ c_. we find that e@xmath47 is readily associated with the upper e@xmath48 phonon branch that is mostly flat in the visible energy region .",
    "d@xmath46 can arise from the lower e@xmath32 phonon branch .",
    "it is 60 - 1 below the calculated double resonance curve .",
    "this error while substantial is of the same order as the error for the d band and appears to confirm what seems to be an overestimation of the phonon frequencies in the @xmath18 t direction close to the edge of the bz .",
    "finally , we can treat the 1450 - 1 band that has been observed in ref.@xcite in 6 samples exposed to air the same way .",
    "this band ( labeled d@xmath49 and represented by a small circle at 2.41ev in fig.[fig : cac6dr]_b _ ) can be allocated to the highest double resonance curve originating from the upper e@xmath33 branch . indeed ,",
    "examination of fig.1__b _ _ of ref.@xcite shows that the the 1450 - 1 feature appears only along a very strong d band and is absent in spectra from freshly cleaved samples where the d band is weak .",
    "consequently this peak can not be attributed to a raman active mode but is a disorder induced drrs band .",
    "the same argument holds also for the d@xmath37 band visible in fig.3 of ref.@xcite .",
    "it confirms our interpretation of d@xmath37 as due to drrs .",
    "the frequencies of disorder induced bands can be plotted in the phonon dispersion diagram yielding a measurement for points of the phonon dispersion inside the bz .",
    "the electronic band separation is in resonance with the red laser excitation of @xmath50 nm ( 1.917ev ) at @xmath51 and with the blue excitation @xmath52 nm ( 2.604ev ) at @xmath53 , here @xmath54 is the extension of the bz in the respective direction .",
    "the corresponding resonant transition pairs ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) are plotted for the frequencies of the disorder bands @xmath57 in fig.[fig : cac6dr]_c_. from these experimentally measured points of phonon dispersion we conclude that the calculation from first principles as performed in ref.@xcite underestimates the energy of the e@xmath30 zone center mode , but tends to overestimate the energy of high frequency e@xmath1 branches close to the edge of bz in the @xmath18 t direction .",
    "below  low energy electronic raman scattering exhibits a sharp sc coherence peak in the e@xmath1 symmetry channel at 24 - 1 ( fig.[fig : cac6phon1 ] and fig.[fig : cac6qual]_c _ ) .",
    "the position of the coherence peak ( @xmath58 ) is in - between the values @xmath59 - 1 reported from directional point contact spectroscopy@xcite , where @xmath60 refers to the direction of the current flow , and 25.8 - 1 determined by stm measurements@xcite .",
    "the fwhm @xmath412 - 1 of the coherence peak obtained by focusing the laser on a few high - quality areas of the cleaved surface is of the same magnitude as the width of the step in the increase of reflectance below @xmath61 observed in ref.@xcite and corresponds to the range of the anisotropic gap distribution suggested in ref.@xcite .",
    "but the characteristic width of the sc coherence peak and impurity related broadening will also contribute to the observed line width putting limits on possible gap distributions .",
    "reactivity with air humidity poses a significant challenge to experimental investigation of 6 .",
    "previous spectroscopic work on lattice dynamics@xcite shows that raman scattering is in particular sensitive to sample aging with the characteristic e@xmath30 mode disappearing in less than half an hour upon air exposure .",

    "a similar i(d)/i(g ) intensity ratio is observed in annealed hopg samples irradiated with @xmath71b ions@xcite at a flux rate of @xmath72@xmath73 .",
    "intercalated ca ions when displaced from their triangular pattern in the perfect crystalline order will have the effect of implanted stray coulomb potentials in 6 and will display a raman signature that corresponds to the _ micro - crystallite regime _ described in ref .",

    "there is a distribution of results ranging from absence of any sc features in the raman spectrum ( fig.[fig : cac6qual]_a _ ) to a sharp , well pronounced sc coherence peak ( fig.[fig : cac6qual]_c _ ) .",
    "broadening and vanishing of the sc coherence peak is attributed to different degrees of disorder caused by possible li - ion contamination , ca deintercalation or aging of the cleaved surface .",

    "we therefore suggest that down to the skin depth the 6 structure is disturbed from its rhombohedral form by ca deintercalation .",
