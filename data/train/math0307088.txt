    "in the recent years , several new periodic solutions to the @xmath0-body problem have been found by minimizing the action functional in space of loops having some special symmetries ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the present work is motivated by the results in @xcite where the authors prove the existence of collisionless minimizers in very general classes of symmetric loops : a natural question is whether these minimizers are rigid motions corresponding to central configurations .    to be more precise",
    "we are interested in the @xmath10-periodic solutions to the dynamical systems of @xmath0 bodies , @xmath11 with masses @xmath12 , interacting according to the newton s law @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the potential that generates an attractive force between each pair of bodies .",
    "+ according to @xcite a _ simple choreographies _ is a motion in which the bodies lie on the same curve and exchange their mutual positions after a fixed time .",
    "if @xmath4 are the @xmath0 orbits then we impose the existence of @xmath5 such that @xmath15 where @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we assume that our system consists of particles of equal masses . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that each @xmath16 .    solving ( [ sistema dinamico ] ) under the constraint ( [ cor ] ) is equivalent to seek the critical points of the functional @xmath17 on the set @xmath18    the choreography constraint implies that the quantities @xmath19 only depend on @xmath20 , since there are only @xmath21 distinct average on @xmath22 $ ] of distances between two bodies ; we can then rewrite the action in ( [ azionevecchia ] ) in the easier way @xmath23    recall that a _ central configuration _ is a configuration in which the acceleration vector of every particles is @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and a _ relative equilibrium motion _ is a rigid and uniform rotation of a central configuration around the center of mass ; our main result is the following    [ thm1 ] for every @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the absolute minimum of @xmath28 on @xmath29 is attained on a relative equilibrium motion associated to the regular @xmath0-gon",
    ".    in particular theorem [ thm1 ] implies that , among simple choreographies :    * the minimum is a planar motion ; * the minimum is a motion of relative equilibrium ; * the minimum has minimal period @xmath10 .    in other words , we prove that the absolute minimum of the action integral among @xmath10-periodic loops in @xmath30 is the relative equilibrium solution whose central configuration is an absolute minimum of the potential among all the configurations that generate a simple choreography .",
    "this result agrees with the one of chenciner and desolneux in @xcite in the sense that , among choreographies , the minimum of the action is the relative equilibrium motion correspondent to the minimum among central configurations ; moreover it agrees with the work of albouy and chenciner in @xcite since the minimum is a planar motion .    in literature",
    "we know few works where explicit minima of the action are determined on special classes of loops . from @xcite",
    "we can understand the following assertion @xmath31 it s easy to prove that ( a ) is fulfilled for 3-body in any dimension .",
    "if @xmath32 the minimal central configuration is never planar as soon as @xmath33 , therefore ( a ) never holds ( see correction to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , f. pacella in @xcite , proves that the planar central configurations of 4 equal masses are saddle points for the potential energy and r. moeckel , in @xcite , shows that for every planar configuration of @xmath0 different masses , there exists a variation on the direction perpendicular to the plane of the configuration that makes the potential decrease .    concerning the flat central configurations we know from a. albouy , in @xcite , that the square is the minimal central configuration for 4 bodies and again ( a ) holds true .",
    "on the hands , we recall that palmore in 1976 , in @xcite , claimed that the @xmath0-gon is the minimum among flat central configurations , but some years later slaminka and woerner in @xcite show the @xmath0-gon is not the minimum for @xmath34 , @xmath0 even .",
    "this result shows a strong obstruction to the fulfillment of ( a ) also in the planar case .",
    "numerically , d. ferrario , shows in @xcite that the square and the pentagon are the absolute minima for 4 and 5 bodies respectively , while if @xmath34 the @xmath0-gon is not anymore the absolute minimizer ; but if we take into account just central configurations that generates a simple choreography , we have in @xcite a confirmation of our result .",
    "the above discussion shows that theorem [ thm1 ] relies more on the choreographical assumption than on the properties of the central configurations . in order to obtain a better understanding of the structure underlying theorem [ thm1 ]",
    ", we proceed with the analisys of the same problem in a rotating frame with angular velocity @xmath35 . in this case",
    "the lagrangian action is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the loop in the rotating system on which the bodies move with the choreography constraint @xmath38 . in order",
    "the deal with coercive functionals we shall choose @xmath39 .",
    "our results show a strong dependence on the value of the angular velocity @xmath40 .",
    "indeed consider the function @xmath41 , @xmath42 and let @xmath43 .",
    "we will prove that for @xmath44 theorem [ thm1 ] still holds true . in a similar manner",
    ", we shall show that for @xmath45 in appropriate @xmath46-neighborhood of integers @xmath47 coprime with @xmath0 , @xmath39 , the minimum of the action is still attained on the rigid equilibrium motions associated to the @xmath0-gon , but the minimal period of the motion of each body is now @xmath48 ( see theorem [ int1 ] ) .",
    "the assertion of theorem [ thm1 ] can not be valid for every value of @xmath40 : in fact if we consider values of @xmath40 close to an integer @xmath47 such that @xmath49 , @xmath50 , the minima of the action are more complex orbits that are not anymore rigid motions , but @xmath10-periodic curves with winding number @xmath47 about the center of mass ; furthermore this motions show a clustering phenomenon ( see theorems [ kcopn ] and [ kdivn ] ) .",
    "our rigorous results cover a range of @xmath40 close to the set of integers ; for this reason we investigate numerically the behavior of the minimizers for values of @xmath40 close to an half integer .",
    "the numerical experiments show that the minimizers are not anymore rigid motions , moreover they are not planar provided the number of bodies is large enough ( @xmath51 fits ) while they seem to be planar circles when @xmath52 . as a final remark",
    "non planar motions appear as mountain pass points for low number of bodies ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : the first four sections are devoted to the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] : in section [ sec2 ] we recall its proof in the keplerian case , while in sections [ sec3 ] and [ eigprob ] there are all the elements to make the proof of section [ sec5 ] . in section [ sec7 ]",
    "we study the minima of the action functional when the bodies lie in a rotating system with angular velocity @xmath54 . in the last section",
    "we show examples for theorems [ thm1 ] , [ int1 ] , [ kcopn ] , [ kdivn ] and some non - planar saddle points we have found numerically .",
    "in this section we recall , for the reader s convenience , two classical inequalities and we show the equivalent result of theorem [ thm1 ] in the keplerian case .",
    "this result follows from the application of jensen inequality as first remarked in @xcite and @xcite .",
