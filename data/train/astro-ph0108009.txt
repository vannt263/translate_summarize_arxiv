    "type i x - ray bursts are thermonuclear flashes on the surface of weakly - magnetic ( @xmath0 ) accreting neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) ( lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1995 ; bildsten 1998 ) .",
    "observations with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) have revealed nearly - coherent oscillations during type i x - ray bursts from ten lmxbs , with frequencies in the range 270620 hz ( for reviews , see van der klis 2000 ; strohmayer 2001 ) . these oscillations are interpreted as rotational modulation of surface brightness asymmetries , thus providing a direct measurement of the neutron star spin frequency ( strohmayer et al .",
    "the inferred rotation periods of a few milliseconds support the idea that the neutron stars in lmxbs are the progenitors of the millisecond radio pulsars ( see bhattacharya 1995 for a review ) .",
    "the large modulation amplitudes , high coherence , and frequency stability provide convincing evidence that the burst oscillation frequency is related to the neutron star spin frequency ( strohmayer 2001 and references therein )",
    ". however , many puzzles remain .",
    "open questions include ( i ) the origin of the asymmetry on the surface of the neutron star , particularly during the fading tail of the burst , when the burning is thought to have spread over the whole surface ; ( ii ) why oscillations are seen in some bursts but not others , and in some sources but not others ( e.g. , muno et al .",
    "2001 ) ; and ( iii ) whether the oscillation frequency is the spin frequency or twice the spin frequency , motivated by comparisons of the burst oscillation frequency to the difference between the frequencies of the khz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) seen in the persistent emission ( van der klis 2000 ) .    the oscillation frequency increases by a few hz during the burst .",
    "to explain this , strohmayer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) proposed that the burning shell decouples from the neutron star , and undergoes spin changes due to angular momentum conservation as it expands and contracts .",
    "cumming & bildsten ( 2000 , hereafter cb ) studied the rotational evolution of the neutron star atmosphere during a burst .",
    "rather than addressing the complex problems of how the burning front spreads over the neutron star surface during the burst rise , or what causes the asymmetry at late times , cb asked what could be learned from detailed models of the vertical structure of the atmosphere .",
    "they computed the vertical hydrostatic expansion during the burst , and the resulting spin changes .",
    "they noted that to see a single , coherent frequency requires either the atmosphere be rigidly rotating , or the burning region to be vertically thin , so that the differential rotation across it is small ( see also miller 2000 ) . in order to compare the theoretical results with observations",
    ", cb assumed that the burning shell rotates rigidly .",
    "they found rough agreement between the calculated spin down and observed values .",
    "the composition of the burning shell affects the amount of expansion . for accretion rates relevant to x - ray bursters , the accreted hydrogen ( h ) burns via the hot cno cycle as matter accumulates on the neutron star surface .",
    "the thermally unstable helium ( he ) burning which leads to the type i x - ray burst may occur either before or after the hydrogen has been consumed ( see bildsten 1998 for a review ) , leading to either mixed hydrogen / helium or pure helium ignitions .",
    "the presence of a substantial amount of hydrogen leads to a factor of two greater expansion because of the lower mean molecular weight ( @xmath1 for pure he ; @xmath2 for solar composition ) .",
    "cb noted that the largest frequency shifts observed ( fractional frequency shifts @xmath3% ) were difficult to achieve with pure he ignitions , requiring temperatures at the base of the burning shell extremely close to the limiting value from radiation pressure at the start of the burst .",
    "however , they also noted that no burst oscillations have been seen during type i x - ray bursts with long ( @xmath4 ) cooling tails , characteristic of hydrogen burning ( which is limited by beta decays during the rp process ; bildsten 1998 ) , perhaps indicating a preponderance of he bursts amongst those which show oscillations .",
    "thus they suggested that understanding the largest frequency shifts observed as being due to hydrostatic expansion together with rigid rotation might prove problematic .",
    "recently , two sources have shown extremely large frequency shifts .",
    "wijnands , strohmayer , & franco ( 2001 ) found an increase of @xmath5 in the 567 hz burst oscillation from mxb  1658 - 298 .",
    "in addition to being a large frequency shift ( @xmath6% ) , the spin evolution in this burst was unusual , with a rapid frequency increase occuring several seconds into the burst tail .",
    "this frequency shift is a little larger than the rigidly - rotating mixed h / he models of cb .",
    "galloway et al .",
    "( 2001 ) discovered a 270 hz burst oscillation from the dipping source 4u  1916 - 053 . during 4 seconds in the burst decay ,",
    "the frequency increased by 3.6 hz , a fractional shift of 1.3% , by far the largest fractional frequency shift observed so far . comparing with the results of cb , galloway et al .",
    "( 2001 ) pointed out that the expansion implied by this frequency shift is larger than expected if the atmosphere rotates rigidly , especially given that the measured peak flux of the x - ray burst is sub - eddington ( @xmath7 ) , and that the orbital period of this source ( @xmath8 ; walter et al .",
    "1982 ; white & swank 1982 ; grindlay et al .  1988 ) implies a hydrogen - poor companion ( nelson , rappaport , & joss 1986 ) and therefore a small fraction of hydrogen present at ignition .    in this paper , we present new calculations of the hydrostatic expansion and resulting spin - down of the neutron star atmosphere . in  2 , we describe an error in cb s calculation of the change in the moment of inertia of the burning shell , and show that the values of spin - down calculated by cb are a factor of two too large . comparing the new results with observations , we show that , even when hydrogen is present at ignition , _ the theoretical values of spin - down assuming rigid rotation are a factor of three less than the largest observed frequency shifts_. we then go on to consider different neutron star masses and equations of state . in  3 , we derive the angular momentum conservation law in general relativity , presenting analytic results for slow rotation , and numerical calculations of rapidly - rotating stars .",
    "we compare our results with recent work by heyl ( 2000 ) and abramowicz , kluzniak , & lasota ( 2001 ) . in  4 , we show how to include general relativity and rapid rotation in the equations describing the structure of the atmosphere .",
    "we then rescale our fiducial results of  2 to different neutron star masses and equations of state , before presenting some detailed models and rotational profiles .",
    "we again show that the expected spin - down due to angular momentum conservation is smaller than the observed frequency drifts if the atmosphere rotates rigidly .",
    "we discuss the implications of our results in  5 .",
    "in this section , we first show that cb made an error of a factor of two in their calculation of the change in the moment of inertia during a type i x - ray burst , and then compare the new spin down calculations with observations .    consider a spherical shell at the surface of the star .",
    "( the arguments of this section are unaffected by including the centrifugal distortion of the isobaric surfaces . )",
    "the mass of the shell is @xmath9 and its moment of inertia is @xmath10 where the factor of @xmath11 comes from integrating over angles .",
    "following cb , we adopt a plane - parallel approximation for the thin atmosphere , and write @xmath12 , keeping only first order terms in @xmath13 . changing integration variables from radius @xmath14 to column depth @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , equation ( [ eq : i ] ) reduces to cb s equation ( 19 ) for the moment of inertia .",
    "if the angular momentum of the atmosphere , @xmath17 , is conserved , the spin - down is given by comparing its moment of inertia before the burst with that during the burst , @xmath18 .",
    "the error in cb s calculation of the change in moment of inertia arises because they assume that the total column depth of the atmosphere is constant during the burst .",
    "we now show that this is not the case when the mass of the layer is conserved .",
    "we write the mass of the shell as @xmath19\\ dy=4\\pi r^2\\delta y\\left(1+{2{\\langle z\\rangle}\\over r}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the total column depth , and we define a mass - weighted thickness @xmath21 .",
    "if the vertical extent of the layer @xmath22 changes , so must its total column depth @xmath20 if the total mass @xmath23 is conserved .",
    "physically , a thin spherical shell has a greater surface area if it moves radially outwards , and so must have a lower column depth in order to conserve its total mass . by taking the column depth at the base during the burst to be the same as that before the burst , cb unwittingly increased the mass of the layer during the burst , and so overestimated the change in its moment of inertia .    rather than including the change in the column depth of the layer explicitly",
    ", we write the mass element in equation ( [ eq : i ] ) as @xmath24 , so that there is a unique correspondence between mass and column depth .",
    "the moment of inertia is then @xmath25\\ dy,\\ ] ] where the integration limits are now held fixed during the burst , thereby keeping the mass of the layer constant , @xmath26 .",
    "we have checked the validity of this expression by integrating the full spherical equations for this problem . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a plane - parallel approximation because it allows us to straightforwardly incorporate the general relativistic angular momentum conservation law .",
    "the spin changes during the burst result from changes in the vertical extent of the atmosphere , which are described by the second term of equation ( [ eq : right ] ) . equation ( 19 ) of cb has a factor @xmath27 rather than @xmath28 , so that the spin - down calculated by cb is too large by a factor of 2 .",
    "specifically , both the spin - down of the convection zone shown in figures 2 and 6 of cb , and the spin - down of a rigidly - rotating atmosphere shown in figure 13 of cb , should be reduced by a factor of 2 .",
    "the spin - down of the radiative layers shown in figures 2 , 4 and 6 of cb is , however , calculated correctly , since in that case cb assumed @xmath29 was constant for each spherical shell .",
    "figure [ fig : newsumm ] shows the spin - down calculated using equation ( [ eq : right ] ) for the moment of inertia , presuming the whole atmosphere rotates rigidly during the burst .",
    "this is an updated version of figure 13 of cb , and detailed discussion of the theoretical models may be found in that paper .",
    "the calculated spin down is exactly a factor of two less than found by cb .",
    "we take @xmath30 , the newtonian gravity for a 1.4 @xmath31 , 10 km star .",
    "we consider two pre - burst models , mixed h / he ignition at @xmath32 ( solid lines and squares ) , and pure he ignition at @xmath33 ( dotted lines and open squares ) .",
    "figure [ fig : newsumm ] shows results for both convective and radiative models . for the radiative models , we show the spin down as a function of flux , since the radiative solution is uniquely determined by the flux .",
    "the convective models depend both on the flux and the extent of the convection zone ; we plot the spin down resulting from the convective models given in table 3 of cb .",
    "the convective models have a composition profile the same as that prior to the burst .",
    "the radiative models have either a pre - burst composition ( upper solid and dotted curves ) or a composition of heavy elements ( lower solid and dotted curves ) , either @xmath34ni for pure he burning , or @xmath35kr for mixed h / he burning ( we choose @xmath35kr as representative of the products of rp process h burning ; see schatz et al .",
    "1998 ; koike et al .  1999 ;",
    "schatz et al .  2001 ) .",
    "as described in cb , the radiative and convective models with a pre - burst composition are appropriate for the burst rise , whereas the radiative atmospheres composed of heavy elements are appropriate for the cooling tail of bursts .",
    "convective models spin down more than radiative models because the steeper temperature gradient in the convection zone leads to a larger base temperature for a given flux .    on the left of figure 1 ,",
    "we plot the observed frequency drifts as horizontal bars . a summary of these observations may be found in cb , table 1",
    "; in addition , we include the frequency shifts recently reported for 4u  1916 - 053 ( galloway et al .",
    "2001 ) and mxb  1658 - 298 ( wijnands et al .",
    "for each source , we plot the largest observed frequency shift .",
    "we plot as upper limits those cases for which a frequency was only seen in the burst tail .",
    "the largest observed frequency shift is larger than the theoretical values by at least a factor of 3 .",
    "in this section , we derive the angular momentum conservation law in general relativity . our approach is to calculate the conserved angular momentum of a particle moving on a circular path ( in the appendix , we show that the same result is obtained starting with the conservation equations for a fluid ) .",
    "we show analytic results for slowly rotating stars , and present numerical calculations of rapidly rotating stars .",
    "we compare our results with recent calculations by heyl ( 2000 ) and abramowicz et al .",

    "the specific angular momentum of a particle is given by @xmath29 , where @xmath14 is the distance from the rotation axis .",
    "if the particle s motion conserves angular momentum , the change in its spin frequency with radius is given by @xmath36 .",
    "in this section , we derive the equivalent expression in general relativity .",
    "we start by discussing the angular momentum of a particle moving in the schwarzschild metric .",
    "we then derive the conserved angular momentum in the slow rotation approximation , i.e.  neglecting terms of order @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , allowing us to write an analytic expression for the angular momentum conservation law .",
    "however , since @xmath37 may be quite large ( for example , @xmath39 for a star with @xmath40 and @xmath41 spinning at @xmath42 ) , we conclude this section with detailed numerical calculations of rapidly rotating models .",
    "consider first a spherical star , for which the metric is @xmath43 where outside the star the metric functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 are given by @xmath46 where @xmath23 is the total gravitational mass .",
    "note that in this paper we write the ratio @xmath47 as @xmath48 for clarity , but otherwise explicitly write in the constants @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "a particle moving in a circular path has four - velocity ( e.g. , hartle 1970 ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the angular velocity measured by an observer at infinity , @xmath53 is the redshift factor between the particle and the observer at infinity , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are killing vectors of the spacetime .",
    "the redshift factor is @xmath56 where we choose the standard normalization @xmath57 .",
    "associated with the killing vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the conserved quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the specific energy and angular momentum . using equations ( [ eq : fourvel ] ) and ( [ eq : redshift ] ) , we obtain ( see ,",

    "it is simple to extend this analysis to the case of slow rotation , for which the metric is ( hartle 1967 ) @xmath64 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 have the same solutions as the spherical case outside the star , and where @xmath65 outside the star ( @xmath66 is the total angular momentum of the star ) . again solving for the conserved angular momentum ,",

    "we rescale our fiducial results of  2 for the spin - down of a rigidly - rotating atmosphere to different masses , equations of state , and spin frequencies . in  4.4 , we relax the assumption of rigid - rotation , and present the rotational profiles of the atmosphere for several different cases .",
    "we now write down the differential equations describing the hydrostatic and thermal structure of the atmosphere including general relativity , and compare them to the newtonian equations .",
    "we start by considering a non - rotating star , and then discuss the additional effects of rotation .    for a spherical star , thorne ( 1977 )",
    "( see also thorne 1967 ) gives the equation for mass conservation as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the rest mass ( number of baryons multiplied by baryon rest mass ) within coordinate radius @xmath14 , @xmath96 is the rest mass density , and @xmath97 is the `` volume redshift factor '' . for slow rotation , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the gravitational mass interior to @xmath14 .",

    "figure 1 compares the new calculations of spin - down with observations , including recent measurements of large frequency drifts during bursts ( galloway et al .",
    "2000 ; wijnands et al .",
    "we find that the largest observed frequency shift is a factor of 3 or more greater than the theoretical values .    in  3",
    ", we derived the angular momentum conservation law in general relativity .",
    "we calculated the variation of spin frequency with radial distance , @xmath87 , for a particle moving with constant angular momentum . in the slow rotation approximation ( @xmath171 )",
    ", we obtained the analytic result given by equation ( [ eq : slow ] ) , which agrees with recent work by abramowicz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . for rapidly - rotating stars",
    ", we calculated @xmath172 by numerically solving for the structure of the neutron star .",
    "the correction to the newtonian angular momentum conservation law , @xmath173 , is shown in figure 2 for different neutron star masses , equations of state and spin frequencies .",
    "contrary to the results of heyl ( 2000 ) , which were also shown to be incorrect by abramowicz et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , we find that the general relativistic correction is small , about 510% .    in  4 , we calculated the atmospheric expansion and spin - down , including the effects of rapid rotation and general relativity .",
    "working in the equatorial plane ( in the spirit of cb s calculation , we neglect latitudinal variations in this paper ) , we calculated the scaling factor @xmath154 required to rescale our fiducial results of  2 to different neutron star masses , equations of state , and spin frequencies ( figure 3 ) .",
    "in addition , we presented the rotational profiles for some particular models ( figure 4 ) .",
    "we find that the largest spin - down is for rapid rotation , and low mass stars with a stiff equation of state .",
    "for example , a 1.4 @xmath31 star spinning at 600 hz with the stiff equation of state eos l has @xmath165 .",
    "however , this is not a large enough factor to bring observations and theory into agreement in figure 1 .",
    "the rotational profiles given in figure 4 show that in principle frequency shifts as large as those observed can be obtained by hydrostatic expansion , if we consider only the outermost layers of the atmosphere , and allow differential rotation",
    ". however , it is not at all obvious why the observed frequency would be that of the outermost shells of the atmosphere , which contain a small amount of the mass , particularly since the energy release is in the deeper layers . indeed , cb argued ( see their  3.4 ) that substantial differential rotation in the burning layers would wash out the signal , because of the finite time needed to transport heat vertically in the atmosphere .",
    "another possible objection to the angular momentum conservation picture was given by cb , who pointed out that if the burning layers are threaded by a large scale poloidal magnetic field , this field will be wound up by the differential rotation during the burst .",
    "the wound up toroidal field acts back on the shear , halting and reversing its direction in the time for an alfven wave to cross the atmosphere ( see , for example , spruit 1999 ) . for a magnetic field typical of a millisecond radio pulsar , @xmath174 , this timescale is only @xmath175 .",
    "one possibility is that the surface field is much weaker , @xmath176 , allowing shearing to persist .",
    "observations of burst oscillations in the accreting millisecond x - ray pulsar sax  j1808.4 - 3658 , which perhaps has a @xmath177@xmath178 field ( psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) , would give an interesting test of this picture .",
    "int zand et al .",
    "( 2000 ) report a marginal detection with bepposax of oscillations at @xmath179 during a type i burst , but are unable to resolve any frequency drift . unfortunately , as yet no burst oscillations have been detected from this source with rxte .",
    "the results we have obtained in this paper suggest that we may have to look elsewhere for an explanation of the frequency drifts .",
    "spitkovsky , levin , & ushomirsky ( 2001 ) , in a detailed investigation of hydrodynamic flows during type i bursts , propose that the frequency drifts may be explained by a combination of radial expansion and variations in the velocity of zonal flows on the neutron star surface . another possibility mentioned by cb is that the burst oscillation is due to a non - radial oscillation in the neutron star surface layers .",
    "such possibilities remain to be investigated in detail .",
