    "however , in some exceptional cases the radius @xmath10 of the wave function of a transport site is unreasonably large @xcite .",
    "mobility increases exponentially with the increase of temperature .",
    "there is no consensus on the form of this dependence : some authors favor a simple activation dependence @xmath11 while others argue that the dependence @xmath12 is more accurate .",
    "it is generally accepted that an exponentially strong temperature dependence may be most naturally explained by suggesting that the major factor governing charge transport in disordered organic materials is an energetic disorder : random locations and orientations of molecules in the bulk of the material produce random fluctuations of site energies @xmath13 . then the dependence @xmath14 should be connected with the density of states @xmath15 .",
    "there is no reason for @xmath15 to maintain the same form in different materials and this may be the reason for different forms of @xmath14 .",
    "the most surprising fact is the mobility field dependence . indeed , for carrier hopping between spatially localized sites we should expect @xmath16 just estimating a typical drop in the difference of carrier energy between two transport sites separated by the typical intersite distance @xmath9 . yet instead of eq [ mu(e)_naive ] an almost ubiquitous poole - frenkel ( pf ) dependence emerges in the materials @xmath17 leading to much stronger field dependence of the mobility in weak field .",
    "uncertainty in the form of dependence @xmath14 is mostly originated from the difficulty to measure the quasi - equilibrium ( nondispersive ) mobility in a wide temperature range . in striking contrast to this limitation , dependence ( [ mu(e)_pf ] )",
    "was measured for some materials in really wide field range ( an unrivaled example is ref . with @xmath1 varying from @xmath18 to @xmath19 v / cm ) .    for a long time",
    "an explanation of the pf dependence has been considered as a major problem for the charge transport theory . since the early paper of gill , who suggested an empirical formula @xmath20 , \\label{gill}\\ ] ] based on the study of charge carrier transport in polyvinylcarbazole,@xcite it was very tempting to attribute the field dependence of @xmath0 to the influence of charged traps . in the case of trap - controlled charge transport with charged particles",

    "@xmath21 ( here @xmath22 is a dielectric constant ) and calculated values of @xmath23 are usually close to the measured ones by the order of magnitude , though discrepancies by a factor of 23 are typical . yet this classical pf mechanism attained a lot of criticism because there is no evidence for charged traps to be a common constituent in very different classes of disordered organic materials @xcite .",
    "a first really successful transport model was the gaussian disorder model ( gdm ) @xcite .",
    "in the gdm transport sites are arranged on a regular lattice and are assigned site energies @xmath13 drawn independently from a gaussian distribution having variance @xmath24 .",
    "this model explained many features of charge transport in disordered organic materials , among them the temperature dependence of mobility , transition from the quasi - equilibrium transport to the dispersive - like with temperature decrease , and others features .",
    "still the explanation of the pf field dependence remained an unsolved problem because the gdm can reproduce this dependence in the limited field range only , not significantly wider than @xmath25 v / cm , in weaker field dependence @xmath26 has the usual form ( [ mu(e)_naive ] ) .",
    "moreover , the only reason for the approximate pf dependence in the gdm is the miller - abrahams hopping rate @xcite .",
    "there is no reliable evidence that this particular rate is the universal hopping rate in a wide variety of disordered materials .",
    "for this reason it was highly desirable to retain all useful features of the gdm and yet incorporate some new feature permitting to explain the pf field dependence .",
    "a history of the gdm modification that eventually lead to the successful explanation of the pf dependence ( [ mu(e)_pf ] ) began with the study of dipolar contribution to the total energetic disorder in organic materials .",
    "computer simulation of the distribution of energies for a carrier moving through a simple cubic lattice with sites occupied by randomly oriented dipoles ( thus , the energetic disorder in this case originates from the electrostatic charge - dipole interaction ) was carried out by dieckmann , bssler , and borsenberger @xcite ; they found that @xmath15 has the gaussian form for high concentration of dipoles and goes to the lorentzian one for low dipole concentration .",
    "they calculated the energy variance @xmath27 and found that typical values of @xmath28 are 0.050.1 ev which means that the dipolar contribution should be a significant part of the total @xmath29 ( according to the gdm , @xcite @xmath30 ev is needed to fit experimental temperature dependence of @xmath0 ) .",

    "black and white spheres represent sites with positive and negative values of @xmath13 , correspondingly , while the radius of a sphere is proportional to the absolute value of @xmath13 .",
    "sites with small absolute values of @xmath13 ( less than @xmath40 ) are not shown for the sake of clarity .",
    ", width=288 ]    the most significant property of the dg model is a strong spatial correlation in the distribution of @xmath41 and the energy correlation function decays very slowly with distance @xcite @xmath42 ( here angular brackets denote statistical average ) . in a correlated gaussiam medium the conditional probability @xmath43 which is the probability density to have energy @xmath35 at the site @xmath44",

    ", width=288 ]    another manifestation of the correlated nature of dg is an exact result for the dependence of the distribution of average domain energy @xmath53 on domain size @xmath54 .",
    "for a gaussian random medium without any spatial correlation the distribution has the gaussian form with variance @xmath55 while for spherical domains in dg @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath9 is the radius of the domain .",
    "the difference between ( [ domain_nc ] ) and ( [ domain_dip ] ) suggests that large domains are much more common in dipolar matrix and , indeed , relative number of large clusters in dg is greater by many orders of magnitude in comparison with the uncorrelated medium ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_c]).@xcite    at the same time gartstein and conwell suggested that a correlated nature of the energy landscape should significantly affect charge transport in disordered medium , effectively increasing the typical scale of the hop and , thus , enhancing mobility field dependence .",

    "\\label{3dres}\\ ] ] equations [ 1dres ] and [ 3dres ] have essentially the same dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath2 and only numerical coefficients are different . thus , the simplified 1d model could serve for a quick estimation of the mobility field dependence in disordered materials .",

    "the lowest curve is the mobility for the gdm for @xmath63 . if @xmath64 ev and @xmath65 , then @xmath66 for @xmath67 v / cm.,width=288 ]    good qualitative description of charge transport in a correlated medium is presented in ref . .",
    "the principal difference between a correlated random medium and an uncorrelated one is that in correlated medium deepest valleys of the energetic landscape ( having maximal escape time for a carrier at @xmath68 ) are also the widest .",
    "for this reason carrier escape time for such valleys decreases drastically for @xmath69 .",
    "for every magnitude of @xmath1 a critical size @xmath70 exists such that valleys of this size are the most efficient for carrier capture .",
    "simple calculation gives @xmath71 and @xmath9 in eq [ mu(e)_naive ] should be substituted for @xmath70 .",
    "@xcite this is the physical reason for the pf dependence .",
    "an attracting feature of the dg model is absence of any significant free parameter : the energy scale ( i.e. @xmath29 ) may be calculated using ( [ sd ] ) provided @xmath33 , @xmath32 , and @xmath34 are known .",
    "still , numerical coefficients in eq [ 3dres ] are certainly not constants ( for example , they weakly depend on @xmath10 @xcite ) , so equation [ 3dres ] should be considered rather as a guide and not as a strict relation for @xmath72 in any particular polar material .",
    "another important feature of the dg model is that , unlike the gdm , the form of the mobility field dependence for moderate field does not depend on the particular kind of hopping rate : for @xmath73 mobility dependence retains its pf form ( even the slope is the same @xcite ) for any nonpathological hopping rate .",
    "it is worth to mention , though , that in ( partially ) orientationally ordered dipolar matrices correlation properties of the distribution of @xmath13 may be very different . in such matrices transport properties",
    "may have nothing in common with the usual pf picture .",
    "a vast collection of experimental data indicates that the model of dipolar glass can not serve as a universal explanation for the pf mobility field dependence in disordered organic materials . if the reason for this dependence is the spatial correlation of the dipolar type ( [ c_dip ] ) , then it is absolutely impossible to explain the existence of the pf dependence in nonpolar materials , where it was routinely observed @xcite .",
    "more close study of experimental data reveals , however , that in such materials the experimentally tested field range is not too broad ( not significantly greater than one order of magnitude or even less ) and , moreover , sometimes clearly visible deviations from straight lines can be observed when @xmath74 is plotted against @xmath75 @xcite . in some cases these deviations",
    "lead to the upward convexity of the mobility curve , while in others they lead to the downward convexity .",
    "quite formally , this behavior may be described by @xmath76 with @xmath77 being in some cases smaller than 0.5 and in some cases greater than 0.5 .",
    "this observation hints that , quite possibly , in weakly polar organic materials the real mobility field dependence is not a true pf dependence , but rather a quasi - pf dependence with @xmath78 .",
    "this quasi - pf dependence can successfully imitate true pf dependence in not so wide field range . according to the result of 1d model @xcite ,",
    "the necessary condition for validity of relation ( [ gener ] ) is the algebraic behavior of correlation function @xmath79 .",
    "one possible reason for such behavior is the contribution from randomly oriented quadrupoles .",
    "quite frequently , transport molecules contain highly polar groups having significant dipole moments .",
    "these groups may be arranged in such a way that the total dipole moment of the molecule is close to zero , but the quadrupole moment of the molecule is large enough .",
    "for example , for the particular case of two identical groups having dipole moment @xmath33 , oriented in opposite directions and separated by distance @xmath80 , the total dipole moment of the molecule is exactly zero , but the quadrupole moment @xmath81 is nonzero . in close analogy with the dg model",
    "@xcite we may consider the model of quadrupolar glass ( qg ) , its simplest incarnation being a simple cubic lattice with sites occupied by randomly oriented quadrupoles @xcite .",
    "calculation of the correlation function @xmath82 for the qg model gives @xcite @xmath83 where @xmath34 is the fraction of lattice sites , occupied by quadrupoles . if @xmath84d , @xmath85 , @xmath86  , @xmath87  , then for the totally filled lattice @xmath88 ev . in 1d approximation",
    "the carrier mobility in the qg model for the case of strong disorder @xmath89 has the form @xmath90 \\label{eq11}\\ ] ] this particular field dependence can successfully imitate the pf dependence in not too wide field range @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , there is another factor that can bring the quadrupole field dependence even closer to the pf dependence .",
    "this factor is an effect of dispersive transport : in dispersive regime @xmath92 .",
    "@xcite if plotted as @xmath74 vs @xmath93 , the dispersive component bends the straight line , making the mobility curve convex upward , thus pushing field dependence more close to the pf one ( contribution of the dispersive component is evident , for example , for photocurrent transient in the data of ref . even at high temperature ) .",
    "detailed computer simulation of the 3d charge transport in the qg model has not been carried out yet , but preliminary data unambiguously support the principal result of 1d model for the mobility field dependence @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "analogy with the dg model suggests that the functional type of the mobility dependence on @xmath1 and @xmath2 could be well captured by the 1d model , while numerical coefficients should be different .",
    "extensive comparison of the qg model with experimental data is still absent , though preliminary analysis of transport data for nonpolar polysilanes indicates that dependence @xmath95 is certainly not worse ( in terms of statistical correlation coefficient @xmath96 ) than the pf dependence @xcite .",
    "recently a new model was suggested to explain the pf mobility field dependence in nonpolar polyconjugated polymers such as polyphenylene vinylens ( ppvs ) @xcite . according to this model",
    ", the major source of the energetic disorder in ppvs is almost static intramolecular fluctuations of the torsion angle of benzene ring , resulting in the carrier energy fluctuations with the correlation function @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the intramolecular restoring force constant and @xmath99 is the intermolecular restoring force constant .",
    "this function in the limit case @xmath100 gives an appropriate behavior needed to provide the pf dependence . in",
    "densely packed ppvs typical values of @xmath101 should be small , @xcite and according to the 1d model the mobility field dependence has the form @xmath102 where @xmath32 is the short - range cutoff and @xmath103 is the linear electron - vibration coupling .",
    "field and temperature dependence of the mobility in the la model is different ( though not very different ) from the prediction of the qg model .",
    "thus , a careful study of the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath1 and @xmath2 may provide an opportunity to discriminate between these models . at present",
    ", there is no possibility to state which particular model better describes the mobility field dependence in nonpolar materials .",
    "we should note , though , that the model of quadrupolar glass does not relay on any particular property of the nonpolar material ( apart from its quadrupolar nature ) . from this point of view",
    "it is preferable over la model that , obviously , could hardly be applied for the explanation of the properties of various low molecular weight nonpolar organic glasses .",
    "these materials demonstrate the same pf field dependence as ppvs and can be perfectly well described by the qg model .",
    "high intramolecular flexibility is a necessary prerequisite for significant amplitude of the energetic disorder in the la model , yet experimental data unambiguously demonstrate that some nonpolar materials consisting of very rigid molecules may still have significant energetic disorder ( a good example of the material with planar rigid nonpolar molecules having @xmath104 ev is discussed in ref . ) .",
    "it is worth to add that the very observation that served as a first clue for the la model , the significant difference between slopes of the pf dependence for two particular polyconjugated polymers - one is traditional meh - ppv @xcite and the other one ( having very small slope of the mobility curve ) is stiff - chain polyfluorene @xcite - may be reasonably well explained using the qg model .",
    "indeed , the local stiffness of the main polymer chain should by itself decrease the qudrupolar disorder .",
    "in addition , the molecule of polyfluorene contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms , while the molecule of more flexible meh - ppv contains oxygen atoms as well - this means that the qudrupolar moment of the monomer unit for meh - ppv is greater .",
    "hence , both factors acts in the same direction , decreasing the quadrupolar disorder in polyfluorene and weakening the mobility field dependence .",
    "recent papers on charge transport in ppvs offer a limited opportunity to compare qg and los alamos models .",
    "@xcite these papers offer data on the temperature dependence of the pf coefficient @xmath105 ( see eq [ pf ] ) . by definition @xmath106 and for the la model @xmath107 .",
    "although in the qg model coefficient @xmath108 is not a true constant with respect to @xmath1 , its field dependence is very weak @xmath109 and we can approximately treat it as an effective constant .",
    "results of the fit @xmath110 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fit ] .     obtained by fitting the temperature dependence of @xmath108 for different ppvs on @xmath77 in @xmath110 .",
    "the best fit corresponds to the minimum of @xmath111 .",
    "curves for different ppvs from ref . are marked a , b , c , and d ; curve a represents data from ref .",
    "( the same ppv as for the curve a , but different thickness of the transport layer).,width=288 ]    for most ppvs the best @xmath77 is close to 1.5 and , thus , more close to 1.25 ( qg model ) than to 1 ( la model ) . a possible reason for the discrepancy with the qg model may be the specific technique used in refs . where mobility was calculated from the current - voltage characteristics in the space - charge limited conduction regime assuming the pf mobility field dependence",
    "thus , the mobility field dependence was not calculated at all , only the coefficient @xmath108 was optimized to fit experimental current - voltage curves .",
    "the direct study of the temperature dependence of the corresponding true qg coefficient @xmath112 obtained from tof experiments should be a better way to test the qg model .      in a typical case the total energetic disorder in a material",
    "has several contributions of different nature @xmath113 ( say , dipolar and quadrupolar components ) .",
    "in such situation the correlation function ( assuming statistical independence of individual components ) is a sum of terms having different dependence on distance .",

    ", mobility field dependence could present a clear indication of the existence of several contributions to ( [ utot ] ) only when mobility is measured in an exceptionally wide field range .",
    "careful analysis shows that calculation of individual dipolar and quadrupolar contributions to the total disorder could be performed only in the case when mobility field dependence is measured in the field range spanning at least three orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "this is hardly possible in real experiments .",
    "most organic materials contain impurities serving as traps for charge carriers ( i.e. such impurities have energy levels laying deeper than levels of majority of transport sites ) .",
    "typically , energies of trap sites have no spatial correlation and produce an additional spatially uncorrelated disorder .",
    "important question is : to what extent general properties of charge transport in correlated medium are insensitive to the presence of traps ( later we will limit our consideration to the the particular case of dipolar medium ) ?",
    "this problem has been extensively studied in the 1d approximation and by means of 3d computer simulation @xcite . again ,",
    "major results are the same for both approaches and may be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "addition of traps leads to the decrease of the carrier drift mobility ; 2 .",
    "pf dependence in weak fields remains unchanged without respect to trap depth @xmath116 and concentration @xmath34 ; 3 .   in stronger fields",
    "a linear field dependence @xmath117 emerges .",
    "these conclusions seem to be in striking contradiction with recent experimental observations for transport of holes in doubly doped polymer layers .",
    "@xcite molecules of one dopant , added in small concentration , and possessing significantly lower ionization potential , served as traps for charge carriers . in these studies",
    "it was found that for shallow traps the pf dependence remains mainly untouched @xcite , while for deep traps a linear field dependence was observed in the whole field range . @xcite the most puzzling experimental result is the unusual dependence of the mobility on trap concentration @xmath34 @xcite @xmath118 with @xmath119 instead of expected dependence with @xmath120 for trap - controlled transport .",
    "again , this result does not agree with the theoretical dependence where @xmath120 .",

    "surprisingly , the problem is not connected with any fault of the theory or inaccuracy of modern experimental technique but rather with the interpretation of the experimental data , namely with the particular way of the mobility calculation from the photocurrent transient temporal dependence .    in tof experiment , mobility",
    "is usually calculated by two methods ( fig .",
    "[ fig_mu ] ) .",
    "the first method is the method of choice for most experimental papers .",
    "unfortunately , this particular method is too sensitive to the variation of the shape of the transient with variation of @xmath1 ( or @xmath34 ) and tends to overestimate the contribution of fast under - relaxed carriers .",
    "@xcite the second method produces mobility that is much more close to the strict definition of the mobility as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is an average carrier velocity .",
    "the sensitivity of the first method is so significant that even in the case when good current plateau with @xmath126 const is observed in the whole range of variation of the parameter ( e.g. , @xmath1 ) , there is a possibility to obtain principally different mobility field dependences for @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_x ] ) .    , @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 lattice planes ( equivalent to transport layer thickness of 30 - 40 @xmath0 m ) for different methods of mobility calculation : @xmath132 - diamonds , @xmath133 - triangles , and @xmath134 - squares .",
    "here @xmath34 is a fraction of sites occupied by traps.,width=288 ]    note , that for this particular case in the whole field range the transient is more or less nondispersive and has a well - defined plateau ( fig . [ fig_x2 ] ) .",
    "we can conclude that in some cases mobility , calculated by the first method , effectively masquerades a real field dependence of the true mobility .",
    "the same reason explains an unusual dependence of the mobility on trap concentration .",
    "@xcite    : 0.021 ( thin line ) and 1.70 ( thick line ) , correspondingly , with time axis rescaled to make values of @xmath123 equal for both transients .",
    "all other parameters are the same with fig .",
    "[ fig_x ] .",
    "note the different shapes of transients.,width=288 ]    the second method produces much more reliable results and should be used instead of the first one .",
    "this conclusion is in sharp contradiction with the common belief that field dependences of @xmath135 and @xmath133 are essentially the same ( experimental evidence for the difference may be found in literature , @xcite but it is usually ignored ) .",
    "the use of @xmath133 is especially important in situations where we have to choose among not very distinctive alternatives , such as qg or pf mobility field dependence in nonpolar materials .",
    "original pf mechanism was for a long time considered unacceptable for explanation of the mobility field dependence in disordered organic materials due to absence of charged traps ( arguments provided in ref . suggested that trap density is certainly less than @xmath136 @xmath137 ) . yet in a recent paper the pf model was revitalized by rackovsky and scher , @xcite who argued that a very low density of coulomb traps is enough to produce an essentially nondispersive pf charge transport ( they estimated that @xmath138-@xmath136 @xmath139 should be a sufficient density for transport layer with the thickness of 10 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "because such low density can easily avoid detection , they suggested that the pf model still can be considered as a possible candidate for explanation of charge transport in disordered organic materials .",
    "calculation of the pf effect in ref . was carried out for the usual case of an isolated coulomb trap only .",
    "yet charged traps produce strongly spatially correlated energy landscape , and the hopping charge motion in such landscape usually has many features that can not be captured by the approximation taking into account interaction of charge carrier with the isolated force center .",

    "@xcite this problem has been considered in more detail for a special case of the medium with equal concentration of randomly located positive and negative traps without using the isolated trap approximation .",
    "@xcite the result is in drastic contrast with the approximation of isolated coulomb trap .",
    "for example , at @xmath140 ( here @xmath77 is trap density ) a transition from mobile to immobile carriers occurs and average carrier velocity @xmath141 for @xmath142 in the infinite medium , so in finite transport layers the only possible regime is a dispersive transport with mobility depending on thickness .",
    "@xcite    by accident , mobility field dependence for @xmath142 retains the pf form , but its temperature dependence and , more important , concentration dependence differ drastically from the prediction of the isolated trap model . @xcite for small concentration of traps @xmath143^{1/2 } , \\label{pf_true}\\ ] ] @xmath144 here the lattice version of the model is considered assuming that fraction of sites occupied by charges is small @xmath145 but @xmath146",

    "nonetheless , the mobility temperature dependence ( [ pf_true ] ) seems to be too strong to describe existing experimental data .",
    "for this reason we believe that the model of charged traps can not be suggested as a serious candidate for explanation of charge transport in disordered organic materials .",
    "all variety of disordered organic materials could be subdivided into different classes on the basis of their spatial correlation properties in the distribution of energies of transport sites .",
    "materials from different classes have different transport properties though differences are not very pronounced . in order to discriminate between different classes of the mobility field and temperature dependence , analysis of experimental data",

    "an early attempt to characterize all materials in a unified manner ( the gaussian disorder model ) is unjustified while we can now understand , why it was so successful .",
    "to some extent charge transport theory is ahead of experiment : major predictions ( mostly concerning charge transport in nonpolar materials ) still lack experimental test .",
    "for example , the reasonable question is : which model , quadrupolar glass or los alamos , is more suitable to describe charge transport in nonpolar ppvs ?",
    "a careful and purposeful experimental study of the transport properties of nonpolar materials could resolve this problem .",
