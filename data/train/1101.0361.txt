    "the possibility to switch the ground - state of a josephson junction from a @xmath0 to a @xmath1 phase state and the possible application of such junctions in quantum information led to a renewal interest in the study of the so called @xmath1 josephson junctions .",
    "the existence of such a transition was predicted more than thirty years ago,@xcite however due to technological requirements only recently it was observed .",
    "the realization of @xmath1 josephson junctions was achieved in superconductor/ ferromagnet/ superconductor ( sfs ) junctions .",
    "@xcite microscopically , s / f hybrid structures are characterized by an unusual proximity effect , with a damped oscillatory behavior of the superconducting correlations in the f layer ( for a review see refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "this unusual proximity effect in s / f layered structures leads to a number of striking phenomena like the nonmonotonic dependence of their critical temperature and the appearance of oscillations of critical current in sfs josephson junctions as a function of the f layer thickness.@xcite in particular the change of sign of the critical current corresponds to the so - called @xmath2 transition .    on the other hand , sfs junctions , as any metallic junction exhibit very small resistances and",
    "therefore are not quite suitable for those applications , for which active josephson junctions are required",
    ". this problem can be solved by adding an additional insulating ( i ) layer to increase the resistance .",
    "sifs junctions represent an interesting case for practical use of @xmath1 josephson junctions .",
    "for instance , a sifs structure offers the freedom to tune the critical current density over a wide range and at the same time realize high values of the product of the junction critical current @xmath3 and its normal state resistance @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite in addition , nb based tunnel junctions are usually underdamped , which is desired for many applications . due to these advantages , sifs @xmath1 junctions have been proposed as potential elements in superconducting classical and quantum logic circuits.@xcite for instance , sifs junctions can be used as complementary elements ( @xmath1 - shifters ) in rsfq circuits ( see ref .   and references therein ) .",
    "finally , sifs structures have been proposed for the realization of so called @xmath5-junctions with a @xmath5 drop in the ground state , where @xmath6.@xcite the properties of sifs junctions have been intensively studied both experimentally@xcite and theoretically .",
    "@xcite however , properties of the quasiparticle current have received relatively little attention so far , although they can be very important for the description of sifs junctions as possible elements of superconducting logic circuits .",
    "the purpose of this work is to provide a quantitative model describing the behavior of quasiparticle current in sifs junctions as a function of parameters characterizing material properties of the ferromagnetic interlayer .",
    "we also focus our study on the properties of the density of states ( dos ) in s / f bilayers and discuss the oscillations of the dos at fermi energy .",
    "finally , we calculate the macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) escape rate for current - biased sifs junctions by taking into account the dissipative correction due to the quasiparticle tunneling . based on this",
    "we conclude that the influence of the quasiparticle dissipation on the macroscopic quantum dynamics of sifs junctions is small , which is an advantage of sifs junctions for quantum logic ( qubit ) applications .",

    "we have discussed the dos properties paying special attention to the dos oscillations at the fermi energy .",
    "we have also proposed to measure the exchange field in experiments on weak ferromagnets by measuring the dos peak at @xmath103 .",
    "we compared the results , obtained with a self - consistent numerical method , with a known analytical dos approximation , which is valid when the ferromagnetic layer is thick enough .    using the numerically obtained dos we have calculated the current - voltage characteristics of a sifs junction and have observed features which are the signatures of the proximity effect in the s / f bilayer .",
    "we showed that there exists typical shape patterns of current - voltage characteristics related to the typical dos structures in the ferromagnetic interlayer .",
    "finally , we have calculated the macroscopic quantum tunneling escape rate for the current biased sifs junctions by taking into account the dissipative correction due to the quasiparticle tunneling .",
