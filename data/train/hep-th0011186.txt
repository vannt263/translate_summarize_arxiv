    "in particle phenomenology , the impressive success of the standard theory based on @xmath3 has naturally led to the question of how to extend the theory to higher energies ?",
    "one is necessarily led by weaknesses and incompleteness in the standard theory .",
    "if one extrapolates the standard theory as it stands one finds ( approximate ) unification of the gauge couplings at @xmath6 gev .",
    "but then there is the _ hierarchy _ problem of how to explain the occurrence of the tiny dimensionless ratio @xmath7 of the weak scale to the unification scale .",
    "inclusion of gravity leads to a _ super - hierarchy _ problem of the ratio of the weak scale to the planck scale , @xmath8 gev , an even tinier @xmath9 dimensionless ratios .",
    "although this is obviously a very important problem about which conformality by itself is not informative , we shall discuss first the hierarchy rather than the super - hierarchy .",
    "there are four well - defined approaches to the hierarchy problem :    * \\1 .",
    "supersymmetry * \\2 . technicolor . *",
    "extra dimensions . * \\4 .",
    "conformality .",
    "_ supersymmetry _ has the advantage of rendering the hierarchy technically natural , that once the hierarchy is put in to the lagrangian it need not be retuned in perturbation theory .",
    "supersymmetry predicts superpartners of all the known particles and these are predicted to be at or below a tev scale if supersymmetry is related to the electroweak breaking .",
    "inclusion of such hypothetical states improves the gauge coupling unification . on the negative side",
    ", supersymmetry does not explain the origin of the hierarchy .",
    "_ technicolor _ postulates that the higgs boson is a composite of fermion - antifermion bound by a new ( technicolor ) strong dynamics at or below the tev scale .",
    "this obviates the hierarchy problem . on the minus side ,",
    "no convincing simple model of technicolor has been found .",
    "_ extra dimensions _ can have a range as large as @xmath10 and the gauge coupling unification can happen quite differently than in only four spacetime dimensions .",
    "this replaces the hierarchy problem with a different fine - tuning question of why the extra dimension is restricted to a distance corresponding to the weak interaction scale .",
    "there is also a potentially serious problem with the proton lifetime .",
    "_ conformality _ is inspired by superstring duality and assumes that the particle spectrum of the standard model is enriched such that there is a conformal fixed point of the renormalization group at the tev scale . above this scale",
    "the coupling do not run so the hierarchy is nullified .",
    "conformality is the approach followed in this paper .",
    "we shall systematicaly analyse the compactification of the iib superstring on @xmath11 where @xmath1 is a discrete non - abelian group .",
    "the duality between weak and strong coupling field theories and then between all the different superstring theories has led to a revolution in our understanding of strings .",
    "equally profound , is the ads / cft duality which is the subject of the present article .",
    "this ads / cft duality is between string theory compactified on anti - de - sitter space and conformal field theory .    until very recently , the possibility of testing string theory seemed at best remote .",
    "the advent of @xmath12s and large - scale string compactification suggest this point of view may be too pessimistic , since both could lead to @xmath13 evidence for strings .",
    "with this thought in mind , we are encouraged to build @xmath12 models with realistic fermionic structure , and reduce to the standard model below @xmath14 .",
    "using ads / cft duality , one arrives at a class of gauge field theories of special recent interest .",
    "the simplest compactification of a ten - dimensional superstring on a product of an ads space with a five - dimensional spherical manifold leads to an @xmath15 supersymmetric gauge theory , well known to be conformally invariant@xcite . by replacing the manifold @xmath16 by an orbifold @xmath17 one arrives at less supersymmetries corresponding to @xmath18 depending@xcite on whether : ( i ) @xmath19 , ( ii ) @xmath20 but @xmath21 , or ( iii ) @xmath22 but @xmath23 respectively , where @xmath1 is in all cases a subgroup of @xmath24 , the isometry of the @xmath16 manifold .    it was conjectured in @xcite that such @xmath25 gauge theories are conformal in the @xmath26 limit .",
    "in @xcite it was conjectured that at least a subset of the resultant nonsupersymmetric @xmath27 theories are conformal even for finite @xmath28 and that one of this subset provides the right extension of the standard model .",
    "some first steps to check this idea were made in @xcite .",
    "model - building based on abelian @xmath29 was studied further in @xcite , arriving in @xcite at an @xmath30 model based on @xmath31 which has three families of chiral fermions , a correct value for @xmath32 and a conformal scale @xmath33  tev .",
    "the case of non - abelian orbifolds bases on non - abelian @xmath1 has not previously been studied , partially due to the fact that it is apparently somewhat more mathematically sophisticated .",
    "however , we shall show here that it can be handled equally as systematically as the abelian case and leads to richer structures and interesting results .    in such constructions , the cancellation of chiral anomalies in the four - dimensional theory , as is necessary in extension of the standard model ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , follows from the fact that the progenitor ten - dimensional superstring theory has cancelling hexagon anomaly@xcite .",
    "we consider all non - abelian discrete groups of order @xmath34 . these are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "there are exactly 45 such non - abelian groups . because the gauge group arrived at by this construction@xcite is @xmath35 where @xmath36 are the dimensions of the irreducible representations of @xmath1",
    ", one can expect to arrive at models such as the pati - salam @xmath37 type@xcite by choosing @xmath38 and combining two singlets and a doublet in the * 4 * of @xmath39 .",
    "indeed we shall show that such an accommodation of the standard model is possible by using a non - abelian @xmath1 .",
    "the procedures for building a model within such a conformality approach are : ( 1 ) choose @xmath1 ; ( 2 ) choose a proper embedding @xmath22 by assigning the components of the * 4 * of @xmath40 to irreps of @xmath1 , while at the same time ensuring that the * 6 * of @xmath40 is real ; ( 3 ) choose @xmath28 , in the gauge group @xmath35 .",
    "( 4 ) analyse the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking .    in the present study we shall most often choose @xmath38 and aim at the gauge group @xmath41 . to obtain chiral fermions",
    ", it is necessary@xcite that the * 4 * of @xmath40 be complex @xmath42 .",
    "actually this condition is not quite sufficient to ensure chirality in the present case because of the pseudoreality of @xmath43 .",
    "we must ensure that the * 4 * is not just pseudoreal .",
    "this last condition means that many of our 45 candidates for @xmath1 do not lead to chiral fermions .",
    "for example , @xmath44 has irreps of appropriate dimensionalities for our purpose but with @xmath45 it will not sustain chiral fermions under @xmath46 because these irreps are all , like @xmath43 , pseudoreal .",
    "then a pseudoreal * 4 * would give chiral fermions .",
    "] applying the rule that * 4 * must be neither real nor pseudoreal leaves a total of only 19 possible non - abelian discrete groups of order @xmath2 .",
    "the smallest group which avoids pseudoreality has order @xmath47 but gives only two families .",
    "the technical details of our systematic search will be given in sections v and vi .",
    "the simplest interesting non - abelian case which has @xmath48 and gives three chiral families in a pati - salam - type model@xcite .    before proceeding to details",
    ", it is worth reminding the reader that the conformal field theory ( cft ) that it exemplifies should be free of all divergences , even logarithmic ones , if the conformality conjecture is correct , and be completely finite . further the theory is originating from a superstring theory in a higher - dimension ( ten ) and contains gravity@xcite by compactification of the higher - dimensional graviton already contained in that superstring theory . in the cft",
    "as we derive it , gravity is absent because we have not kept these graviton modes - of course , their influence on high - energy physics experiments is generally completely negligible unless the compactification scale is `` large''@xcite ; here we shall neglect the effects of gravity .",
    "it is worthwhile noting the degree of constraint imposed on the symmetry and particle content of a model as the number of irreps @xmath49 of the discrete group @xmath50 associated with the choice of orbifold changes .",
    "the number of gauge groups grows linearly in @xmath49 , the number of scalar irreps grows roughly quadratically with @xmath49 , and the chiral fermion content is highly @xmath51 dependent .",
    "if we require the minimal @xmath50 that is large enough for the model generated to contain the fermions of the standard model and have sufficient scalars to break the symmetry to that of the standard model , then @xmath52 appears to be that minimal choice@xcite .",
    "although a decade ago the chances of testing string theory seemed at best remote , recent progress has given us hope that such tests may indeed be possible in ads / cfts .",
    "the model provided here demonstrates the standard model can be accommodated in these theories and suggests the possibility of a rich spectrum of new physics just around the tev corner .",
    "> from any good textbook on finite groups@xcite we may find a tabulation of the number of finite groups as a function of the order g , the number of elements in the group . up to order 31 there is a total of 93 different finite groups of which slightly over one half ( 48 ) are abelian .    amongst finite groups ,",
    "the non - abelian examples have the advantage of non - singlet irreducible representations which can be used to inter - relate families . which such group to select is based on simplicity : the minimum order and most economical use of representations@xcite .",
    "let us first dispense with the abelian groups .",
    "these are all made up from the basic unit @xmath54 , the order p group formed from the @xmath55 roots of unity .",
    "it is important to note that the the product @xmath56 is identical to @xmath57 if and only if p and q have no common prime factor .",
    "if we write the prime factorization of g as : @xmath58 where the product is over primes , it follows that the number @xmath59 of inequivalent abelian groups of order g is given by : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number of unordered partitions of @xmath62 .",
    "for example , for order @xmath63 the value would be @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 it is simple to evaluate @xmath59 by inspection . @xmath66 unless g contains a nontrivial power ( @xmath67 ) of a prime .",
    "these exceptions are : @xmath68 ; and @xmath69 .",
    "this confirms that : @xmath70 we do not consider the abelian cases further in this paper .",
    "+ of the nonabelian finite groups , the best known are perhaps the permutation groups @xmath71 ( with @xmath72 ) of order @xmath73 the smallest non - abelian finite group is @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , the symmetry of an equilateral triangle with respect to all rotations in a three dimensional sense .",
    "this group initiates two infinite series , the @xmath71 and the @xmath76 .",
    "both have elementary geometrical significance since the symmetric permutation group @xmath71 is the symmetry of the n - plex in n dimensions while the dihedral group @xmath76 is the symmetry of the planar n - agon in 3 dimensions . as a family symmetry",
    ", the @xmath71 series becomes uninteresting rapidly as the order and the dimensions of the representions increase . only @xmath74 and @xmath77",
    "are of any interest as symmetries associated with the particle spectrum@xcite , also the order ( number of elements ) of the @xmath71 groups grow factorially with n. the order of the dihedral groups increase only linearly with n and their irreducible representations are all one- and two- dimensional .",
    "this is reminiscent of the representations of the electroweak @xmath78 used in nature .",
    "each @xmath76 is a subgroup of @xmath79 and has a counterpart double dihedral ( also known as dicyclic ) group @xmath80 , of order @xmath81 , which is a subgroup of the double covering @xmath43 of @xmath79 .    with only the use of @xmath76 , @xmath80 , @xmath71 and the tetrahedral group t ( of order 12 , the even permutations subgroup of @xmath77 ) we find 32 of the 45 nonabelian groups up to order 31 , either as simple groups or as products of simple nonabelian groups with abelian groups : ( note that @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) some of these groups are firmiliar from crystalography and chemistry , but the nonabelian groups that do not embed in in @xmath43 are less to have seen wide usage .",
