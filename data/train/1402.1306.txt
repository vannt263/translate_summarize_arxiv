    "the strong upturn in @xmath68(@xmath18 ) and @xmath100 at lower temperatures is due to the antiferromagnetic phase transition at @xmath22 .",

    "note that due to the solidification of the pressure medium , the measurements at 0.104gpa were limited to @xmath106 14.5k . since changes of the lattice expansivity under a pressure of 0.104gpa for a material with a normal bulk modulus are expected to be less than 1% ,",
    "see ref . and the discussion therein",
    ", we attribute these effects to the influence of pressure on the material s magnetic properties and their coupling to the lattice degrees of freedom .",

    "the dominant ferromagnetic character of this interaction is assigned to the cu2-o3-cu2 exchange path ( cf .",
    "6a ) connecting dimers of adjacent chains along the @xmath124-axis .",
    "the corresponding cu2-o3-cu2 bond angle amounts to 91.57@xmath154 at 5k , consistent with a weak ferromagnetic interaction as revealed for hydroxo - bridged cu(ii ) complexes @xcite .",
    "note that also the dft calculations for the `` full model '' of azurite exhibit a small ferromagnetic exchange @xcite .",
    "it is likely that under hydrostatic pressure the structure will deform in a way such that this angle decreases with increasing pressure .",
    "this is consistent with an increase of the ferromagnetic inter - dimer coupling @xmath119 derived from susceptibility measurements under pressure , cf.fig.4 .",
    "+ in the following we will argue that the auxetic behavior at @xmath22 and the huge magneto - elastic coupling of azurite is likely due to peculiarities of the molecular arrangement in this compound , in particular that of the cu@xmath1o@xmath11 dimer units , cf.fig.6 . as shown in fig.6b ,",
    "cuo@xmath152 monomer units ( containing cu1 ) are connected via o2 ions to cu@xmath1o@xmath11 dimers ( containing cu2 and marked by yellow planes in fig.6 ) to form chains along the @xmath8 axis . according to structural data at room temperature @xcite and 5k @xcite , cf.table 1 , the structural parameters of the monomers , involving o1-cu1 and o2-cu1 bonds , change very little upon cooling and are very close to those values ( 1.90 - 1.93@xmath155 ) typically found in isolated cu(ii ) complexes @xcite .",
    "this indicates a stable and rigid configuration of the cuo@xmath152 monomer units .",
    "in contrast , the structural parameters of the cu@xmath1o@xmath11 dimers are rather unusual . in particular the cu2-o2 bonds , mediating the intra - dimer coupling @xmath6 , are significantly longer ( 1.9947 @xmath155 and 1.9675 @xmath155 at 300k ) ( see table 1 ) than those found in isolated dimer complexes , reflecting an unusually `` stretched '' arrangement .",
    "it is thus obvious to suspect that this dimer unit represents the flexible part in the structure which may accommodate itself accordingly when the surrounding structure is exposed to external stimuli .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , when a @xmath8-axis strain is applied or , alternatively , upon cooling through @xmath56 which is accompanied by a significant contraction of the @xmath8 axis ( large positive anomaly in @xmath67 , cf.fig.2 ) .",
    "in fact , according to structural data ( table1 ) , it is the o2-o2 distance , as indicated by the blue arrows in fig.6b , across the dimer which yields the strongest reduction upon cooling from at 300k to 5k , reflecting the softness of these dimer units .",
    "note that changes of the cu2-o2 geometry imply changes of the dominant magnetic interaction @xmath6 .",
    "as fig.6b suggests , such a contraction along the @xmath8-direction will cause not only a reduction of the o2-o2 distance .",
    "it will also lead to changes of the cu2-o2 bond length and the cu2-o2-cu2 bond angle ( 97.77@xmath154 at 300k ) within the dimers .",
    "in fact , the 5k structure reveals an cu2-o2-cu2 angle of 98.41(7)@xmath154 . at the same time it is conceivable that upon the reorientation of the dimer in response to a @xmath8-axis strain , the tensile forces acting on the dimers get weaker , allowing the dimers to adopt a more natural , compact configuration , consistent with the observed reduction of the cu2-o2 bond lengths .",
    "this less - strained dimer configuration is also visible in the intra - dimer o3-o3 distance which is reduced as well ( see table 1 and the yellow arrows in fig .",
    "due to the orientation of the dimer unit in the @xmath156 plane , a reduction of the @xmath8 axis is connected with a reduction of the @xmath124- and @xmath157-axis which then explains the anomalous poisson effect @xcite at low temperatures .",
    "+ as for the anomalously large magneto - elastic coupling @xmath94 , one might expect that the stretched arrangement of the dimers may alter the relationship between the exchange coupling constant and the dimers structural parameters @xmath158 , such as the inter - atomic distances or bonding angles , and with it the generalized derivatives @xmath159/@xmath160 . according to crawford _",
    "@xcite , who investigated various stable hydroxo - bridged dimer complexes , there is a linear correlation between the intra - dimer coupling and both the cu - cu distance as well as the cu - o - cu bond angle .",
    "all of these materials exhibit nearly the same typical cu - o distances .",
    "it is likely that these relations may change significantly for a strongly stretched configuration , as realized for the dimer units in azurite .",
    "this may result in strongly enhanced derivatives @xmath159/@xmath160 such as the large magneto - elastic coupling constant @xmath159/@xmath5 revealed here .",
    "a microscopic theory , addressing the relationship between the coupling constants and the dimers structural parameters , is necessary to confirm this conjecture .",
    "note that the presence of pre - strained structural units in azurite is consistent with the fact that a hydrothermal synthesis technique operating at a pressure of about 0.350gpa has to be applied for growing single crystals of this mineral @xcite .",
    "measurements of the longitudinal elastic constant @xmath2 and the uniaxial thermal expansion coefficients @xmath100 on single crystalline azurite reveal pronounced anomalies associated with the intra - dimer coupling constant @xmath6 . from a quantitative analysis of the elastic constant data ,",
    "an exceptionally large value of the magneto - elastic coupling @xmath3 = @xmath4/@xmath5 of @xmath161 ( 3650 @xmath10 150)k has been derived . by lacking a microscopic theory , we tentatively assign this large value , exceeding corresponding magneto - elastic couplings for other low - dimensional quantum spin systems by two to three orders of magnitude , to structural peculiarities of azurite .",
    "we propose that it is the cu@xmath1o@xmath11 dimer unit , which is incorporated in the structure in an unnaturally stretched manner , which is responsible for the exceptionally large magneto - elastic coupling in this system .",
