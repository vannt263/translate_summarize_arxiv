    "narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1 ) are a subclass of type 1 seyfert galaxies defined by their extremely narrow optical permitted emission lines ( fwhm @xmath1 ^ -1 km s@xmath2 ) in comparison with normal broad - line active galactic nuclei ( agn ; osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) .",
    "they show extreme agn properties ; their uv - optical emission lines put them at one extreme end of the boroson & green ( 1992 ) primary eigenvector and they tend to display unusual behavior in other wavebands , especially in the x - rays .",
    "a summary of the properties of nls1s can be found in boller , brandt , & fink ( 1996 ) and taniguchi , murayama , & nagao ( 1999 ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      to derive the cross - correlation function ( ccf ) between the x - rays ( assumed to be the driving light curves ) and the uv ( from paper ii ) and optical continua ( assumed to be the responding light curves ) we utilized the interpolated ccf ( iccf ) method @xcite , as implemented by white & peterson ( 1994 ) , and the z - transformed discrete correlation function ( zdcf ) method @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties on the lags were estimated using the flux randomization / random subset selection ( fr / rss ) method @xcite .    as evident in paper i , the x - rays are significantly correlated with the uv continuum that follows them with a lag of @xmath00.4 days .",
    "we find a similar relation between the soft - x - ray ( 0.71.3 kev from _ asca _ ; paper i ) and hard - x - ray bands ( 210 kev from _ rxte _ ; pounds et al .",
    "2001 ) and the uv continuum .",
    "figure  [ ccf ] shows the ccfs between the two x - ray bands and the continuum at 1365  as well as the computed lags and their uncertainties .",
    "both lags are consistent with being larger than zero to at least 68% confidence according to the fr / rss method .",
    "we have not found any significant correlation between the x - rays and the optical band by correlating the entire data sets ( figure  [ ccf]c ) .",
    "however , there is an indication that one pronounced event , seen in the x - ray light curves of both _ rxte _  and _ asca _ , is also observed in the optical band .",
    "this event is clearly seen in figure  [ event ] as a rise in both the x - ray and optical light curves at jd@xmath32451707 , peaks at jd@xmath32451710 ( jd@xmath32451713 ) in x - ray ( optical ) , and then declines rapidly in the x - rays , but more slowly in the optical band .",
    "this same pattern is also seen in the simultaneous uv light curves of akn 564 ( figure  [ event]c ; paper ii ) .",
    "figure  [ ccf]d shows that when the x - ray and optical narrow - band light curves are truncated to @xmath410 days around the peak of this event , a highly significant correlation , @xmath5 , arises with a lag of @xmath6 days .",
    "we emphasize that other events that are seen in the x - ray light curves , with similar amplitudes , have no detected counterparts in the optical band .",
    "the photometric broad - band data sets were also cross - correlated with the x - rays and uv continua .",
    "the results are consistent with those derived with the spectral narrow bands , although the correlations are less significant . in particular , the relatively dense photometric sampling around the optical event , dominated by the skinakas data set , shows a @xmath01.5 days lag of the optical band relative to the x - rays .",
    "except for the case of this single event , we found no correlation between the optical broad bands and the x - rays .",
    "as described in   [ 3.1 ] , the rapid x - ray variations are not detected in the optical and uv bands .",
    "a similar relation between the x - rays and the optical band in agn , i.e. , selective response or no response at all of the optical band to the rapid x - ray variations , was recently reported for ngc 3516 @xcite and previously reported for two nls1s : ngc 4051 @xcite and iras  13224@xmath73809 @xcite , although for the latter , significant optical variations of hourly time - scale were independently found @xcite .",
    "however , one event is observed in the light curves of all the bands covered by our campaign . as described in   [ 3.2 ] , this event appears as a large - amplitude x - ray flare ( factor of 3 ) that rises and declines on a time - scale of @xmath00.5 days , while in the uv and optical bands this flare smears to a small bump on a time - scale of a few days with a much smaller amplitude ( 10% change in flux ) .",
    "motivated by the single event , we checked whether our data are consistent with reprocessing models in the following ways : 1 ) by measuring the energy carried by the event across the spectrum , and 2 ) by comparing the mean energy contained in the 210 kev and the 0.71.3 kev bands with that contained in the 13656900  band .",
    "we corrected the observed uv / optical spectrum of akn 564 for galactic extinction by applying a standard extinction law ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) with @xmath8 mag ( schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) .",
    "since indications for pronounced reddening in the uv , caused by intrinsic absorbing dust in akn 564 , have been reported in the past ( walter & fink 1993 ) , we had to correct for intrinsic extinction by comparing the observed @xmath91640/@xmath94686 emission - line ratio value of @xmath02.7 with the theoretical value @xmath08 ( e.g. , netzer & davidson 1979 ) and by assuming linear extinction in @xmath10 that vanishes at infinite wavelength ; in this case @xmath11 mag .",
    "this way we obtained two different values for the energy of the uv / optical single event and for the mean flux in that band : one that is corrected for standard galactic extinction , and the second that also takes into account the effects of intrinsic reddening .",
    "we estimated the energy possessed by the event in each band , by approximating its temporal profile to a triangular shape and integrating over time .",
    "the mean x - ray fluxes and energy indices were taken from paper i and the mean uv fluxes of paper ii were used . for h@xmath12 ^-1 km s@xmath2",
    "mpc@xmath2 and q@xmath13 , the energy output during the event reached some @xmath14 ergs in each of the hard - x - ray ( 210 kev ) , soft - x - ray ( 0.71.3 kev ) and uv / optical ( 13656900 ) bands , corrected for galactic extinction . the mean flux radiated in the 13656900  band",
    "is @xmath15 ergs s@xmath2 @xmath16 , when corrected for galactic extinction , and is comparable to the mean flux in the 0.71.3 kev and in the 210 kev x - ray bands . on the other hand , the uv / optical ( 13656900 ) flux increases by almost a factor of 4 , when intrinsic reddening is taken into account .",
    "energy considerations suggest that the case of the x - ray ",
    "uv  optical event of jd@xmath32451710 , corrected only for galactic extinction , is consistent with reprocessing models . in such models",
    "it is assumed that the x - rays and the uv / optical band are strongly coupled , since an x - ray continuum source irradiates a relatively dense and cool absorbing medium and the energy of the absorbed x - rays is then re - radiated at longer wavelengths . however , when the uv / optical band is corrected for intrinsic reddening , the mean flux in that band is larger than the combined flux in the 0.71.3 and 210 kev x - ray bands by a factor of two , implying that there is not enough x - ray energy to account for the intrinsic uv / optical single event and mean flux . obviously , the above numbers depend , to a large extent , on the exact energy range considered for the seed photons .",
    "therefore , the reprocessing interpretation of the single event should be considered with caution , depending on the participating energy ranges as well as on the properties and geometry of the intrinsic extinction .",
    "our data imply that it takes an x - ray pulse that covers @xmath17 days in time , @xmath00.4 days to appear in the uv band and then , @xmath02 days later on , to appear in the optical band as well . in both the uv and optical light curves",
    ", this pulse extends to a time - scale of about @xmath18 days .",
    "a simple interpretation of this scenario suggests that the region from which the variable portion of the uv / optical flux is emitted has a size of about 4 light days and is 0.42 light days distant from the x - ray source .",
    "the inferred minimal distance of 0.4 light days , corresponding to the delayed uv response ( with respect to the x - rays ) , can be compared with various theoretical size estimates . for a thin accretion disk , most of the uv flux",
    "is emitted within @xmath030r@xmath19 ( gravitational radii ) . comparing the two suggests m@xmath20@xmath21m@xmath22 , more than an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath23 estimate of pounds et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which is based on a power density spectrum ( pds ) analysis .",
    "thus the size of the reprocessing region is much larger than the size of the internally produced uv radiation , which is what we expect .",
    "mass estimates based on slim accretion disk models , perhaps more appropriate to the case of nls1s , are in closer agreement with the pounds et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimate , since they are associated with higher temperatures and larger uv emitting regions ( abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; mineshige et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the main difficulty with the reprocessing scenario is the observational evidence that , at most times , the bulk of the optical emission does not respond to the x - ray variations , which occur mainly on very short time scales ( 1 day ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the physical nature of the rapid x - ray variations is associated with localized flaring activity @xcite .",
    "such x - ray activity may arise in the corona above the accretion disk .",
    "alternatively , this activity may be a consequence of relativistic boosting as described by young et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and boller et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , such that the x - rays always have a boost factor which is many times larger than the optical boost factor .",
    "the flaring activity may also be associated with the disk itself , where magnetic flares produce large fluctuations in magnetic - field energy release ( mineshige et al .",
    "2000 and references therein ) .",
    "these explanations are consistent with the case of akn 564 because of the absence of an x - ray ",
    "optical correlation , except for the single event . in this case",
    "there might be multiple continuum regions that do not all participate in the reprocessing , perhaps due to unusual geometry .",
    "there is growing evidence that the key to the relationship between the optical and x - ray bands lies in the longer time - scales , i.e. , months to years .",
    "a possible 100-day lag of the x - rays over the optical band ( leading band ) for ngc 3516 was recently reported by maoz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who suggested that the x - rays are possibly emitted by two different components / mechanisms , where one is exhibiting short time - scale behavior ( i.e. , the flaring activity ) which is not reflected in the optical band , while the other exhibits long time - scale variations , which are possibly correlated with the optical band .",
    "a similar case applies for ngc 4051 @xcite , where the long time - scale variations of both the x - ray and optical bands are seen to be correlated , although with zero lag . in order to look for large time - scale trends in the x - ray light curves , we smoothed the _ rxte _",
    "x - ray data with boxcars ranging from 10 to 30 days , similar to what was done for ngc 4051 @xcite and for ngc 3516 @xcite .",
    "the rapid x - ray variations are suppressed to @xmath030% when a smoothing boxcar of 20 days is applied and almost disappear when a boxcar of 30 days is used ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "this behavior is also reflected in the pds of the x - ray variations recently calculated by pounds et al .",
    "these authors report that the turn - over frequency in the pds corresponds to @xmath013 days , which implies that most of the x - ray variability of akn 564 occurs on the order of these time - scales or smaller .",
    "the results presented in this paper show that for akn 564 , on a long time - scale ( months to years ) during this campaign , both the x - rays and the optical bands did not vary .        [ boxcar ]",
    "this paper reports the results of the optical monitoring campaign on the nls1 galaxy akn 564 . during this campaign",
    "akn 564 was observed in x - rays with _ rxte _ , continuously with a varying sampling rate from 1999 january 1 until 2000 september 19 , and with _ asca _ continuously from 2000 june 1 until 2000 july 5 .",
    "the optical observations were made in the 19981999 , 19992000 , and 20002001 seasons with sampling rates varying from once a week to twice a day . in 2000 may ",
    "july , akn 564 was also observed in the uv with _ hst _ , with a sampling rate of @xmath01 day .",
    "our observational results are incorporated with some of the main findings of turner et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and collier et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to produce a complete multiwavelength picture that emerges from this campaign , as follows :    1 .",
    "the very strong ( a factor of 23 peak - to - peak ) and rapid ( 1 day ) x - ray variations that characterize nls1 galaxies are also seen in akn 564 .",
    "the mean x - ray flux was basically constant on time - scales larger than @xmath030 days , similar to the mean uv and optical flux .",
    "2 .   most emission lines did not show any significant variation . ly@xmath24 and @xmath91240 exhibit at most @xmath07% full range flux variations mainly during two short occasions .",
    "this prevented us from measuring accurately the broad - line region size and the central black - hole mass .",
    "however , there is evidence for correlated ly@xmath24-continuum variability which is consistent with 3 days lag and can be used to derive a mass estimate of @xmath25 .",
    "the total flux in the soft x - ray band is well - correlated with the hard x - ray flux , with zero lag .",
    "4 .   the uv continuum follows the x - rays with a lag of @xmath00.4 days . 5 .   the detected wavelength - dependent uv / optical continuum time delays can be considered as evidence for a stratified continuum reprocessing region , possibly an accretion - disk structure .",
    "the 4900  continuum band lags the 1365  continuum by @xmath01.8 days .",
    "the optical continuum is not significantly correlated with the x - rays . however , focusing on a 20-day period around the largest optical event gives a significant correlation with a lag of @xmath02 days .",
    "our data are consistent with reprocessing models on the grounds of a single flare that was observed in all wavelengths .",
    "however , other x - ray flares do not produce corresponding uv / optical continuum emissions .",
