    "the @xmath24 in nqr studies were performed in the frequency range of 7@xmath2560  mhz using a phase - coherent pulsed nqr spectrometer .",

    "the nuclear magnetization recovery curves were analyzed in terms of the quadruple exponential function appropriate for the nuclear spin @xmath51 of the @xmath24 in nuclei  @xcite .",
    "for example , for the 4@xmath49 line with @xmath47 the following formula was applied , @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denote the nuclear magnetization after a time @xmath55 from the nmr saturation pulse and the thermal equilibrium magnetization , respectively . for in sites with a finite @xmath38 , the modification of the recovery curve was adopted from ref .",

    "this tendency is the same as that of isostructural ce@xmath0coin@xmath1 and ce@xmath0rhin@xmath1 .",
    "@xcite    from the bulk property data , ce@xmath0pdin@xmath1 has been characterized as a kondo lattice with the characteristic temperature ( @xmath58  30  k ) that signals the crossover from the high - temperature incoherent to low - temperature coherent kondo state  @xcite . in line with that scenario , the relaxation rate @xmath3 is nearly temperature independent above @xmath59 , as expected for fairly well localized @xmath11 electrons of trivalent ce ions .",
    "below @xmath59 and down to 0.7 k @xmath60 , @xmath3 varies approximately as @xmath5 .",
    "this temperature dependence is distinctly different from the korringa relation @xmath61 = const , appropriate for fermi liquids . in turn , it is quantitatively similar to that of ceirin@xmath13 , which exhibits well - established nfl behavior in the normal state .",
    "@xcite thus , the @xmath3 data on ce@xmath0pdin@xmath1 are fully consistent with the nfl features observed in the bulk properties of the compound .",
    "@xcite    at the onset of the sc state , @xmath3 decreases rapidly , without the hebel - slichter coherence peak , and then varies nearly proportionally to @xmath7 down to the lowest temperatures studied .",
    "this behavior is quite similar to that found for cecoin@xmath13 ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) and ceirin@xmath13 ,  @xcite and it hints at a nodal character of the sc energy gap .",
    "it is worth noting that down to the lowest measurement temperature of 75  mk ( @xmath62 ) , no saturation in @xmath63 is seen , which would be caused by some admixture of paramagnetic impurities .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath3 in the sc state , in conjunction with the absence of the hebel - slichter peak below @xmath6 , indicates that the sc gap in ce@xmath0pdin@xmath1 has a nodal character .",
    "in general , the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate in the sc state can be expressed as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dos , @xmath66 is the anomalous dos arising from the coherence effect of the cooper pairs , and @xmath67 stands for the fermi distribution function .",
    "the energy gap @xmath68 in this equation can be anisotropic , and thus more precisely it should be written as @xmath69 . assuming that the sc gap has a simple horizontal line node in @xmath70-space , i.e. , @xmath71 , and taking into account that the integral of @xmath66 effectively vanishes due to the alternating sign change in @xmath69",
    ", one can properly reproduce the experimental @xmath63 data on ce@xmath0pdin@xmath1 in the entire sc range studied ( see the inset in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) . on the contrary",
    ", no satisfactory description of @xmath63 could be obtained with an isotropic sc gap , even if the anomalous dos term is omitted .",
    "the calculations yielded @xmath72 , which is very close to the @xmath73 derived for cecoin@xmath13 by means of the analogous analysis of the nqr data .",
    "@xcite the similarity in the sc gap amplitudes in the two compounds provides more support for the hypothesis on the @xmath22-wave symmetry of the sc order parameter in ce@xmath0pdin@xmath1 , formulated before on the basis of the bulk property data .",
    "@xcite however , in order to reach a definitive conclusion on this issue , further experimental efforts are necessary , among them nmr knight shift measurements performed on single - crystalline samples .",
    "an nqr study on the heavy - fermion superconductor ce@xmath0pdin@xmath1 has revealed distinct nfl behavior of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation above the sc critical temperature @xmath4  k. the temperature dependence @xmath74 , observed up to @xmath75  k , indicates that the compound is located close to the antiferromagnetic qcp instability . in the sc state , @xmath3 shows no coherence peak and it is proportional to @xmath7 at least down to 75  mk .",
    "these features manifest unconventional superconductivity with line nodes in the sc gap , probably of a character similar to that in cecoin@xmath13 .",
    "further nmr / nqr studies in applied magnetic fields and/or under high pressure , performed on single crystals , would be highly beneficial for microscopic characterization of the properties of ce@xmath0pdin@xmath1 near the field- or pressure - induced qcp .",
