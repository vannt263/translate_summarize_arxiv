    "this means that at the critical value of @xmath112 the evolution of the quantum system is instantaneous .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that observing this effect is not possible as @xmath112 is itself a function of other parameters such as @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116 that limit the instantaneous evolution of quantum system . the different choices of these parameters give rise to some novel results for qslt , which we , next , demonstrate them graphically . in the markovian regime @xcite , eq .",
    "( [ finalqslt ] ) reduces to the following form@xmath117we use this equation to explicitly further investigate the effects of other parameters on the dynamics of qslt by limiting our analysis to the markovian regime .",
    "to get a deep insight into the influence of relativity on the dynamics of qslt , we plot it against different parameters under various conditions . in figure ( [ figure1 ] )",
    ", we plot the qslt against @xmath24 in the presence of environment both for relativistic ( infinite rapidity ) and nonrelativistic cases .",
    "the solid curves represent its behavior under the influence of ohmic reservoir and the dashed curves show its dynamics under the effect of super - ohmic reservoir .",
    "one can see that the qualitative behavior of qslt under the effect of relativity in both ohmic and super - ohmic limits remains unchanged .",
    "however , quantitatively it is damped such that the damping itself becomes a function of @xmath115 . for large @xmath115",
    "the damping is moderate and for small @xmath115 it is strong .",
    "the notable difference between the effect of the two limits of the reservoir is that for ohmic case it goes to zero at different times depending on the choice of the value of @xmath115 whereas for super - ohmic case it reaches a stable and static value , different for every choice of @xmath115 .     as a function of the initial time parameter @xmath118 by choosing the other parameters such that @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122and @xmath123 the solid ( dashed ) curves correspond to ohmic ( super - ohmic ) reservoir .",
    "the red curves present zero relativistic effect @xmath124 whereas the blue and the purple curves correspond to @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively , in the limit of infinite rapidity . ]    the behavior of qslt against rapidity for different choices of @xmath24 is shown in figure ( [ figure2]@xmath127 ) . again",
    "the solid curves in both subfigures represent the effect of ohmic reservoir and the dashed ones show the effect of super - ohmic reservoir . besides the relatively large damping caused by the ohmic reservoir , the effect of both reservoirs is qualitatively identical .",
    "all the curves in figure ( [ figure2]@xmath127 ) correspond to @xmath125 and that in figure ( [ figure2]@xmath128 ) correspond to @xmath129 . in figure ( [ figure2]@xmath127 ) , regardless of the choice of @xmath24 , there is a strict monotonous decrease in qslt with the increasing of rapidity which results to a near zero value at a critical value of @xmath130 for all @xmath24 both for ohmic and super - ohmic reservoir . with further increase in rapidity",
    ", the qslt monotonously increases reaching a saturation value different for each choice of @xmath24 .",
    "in other words , the evolution process constantly speeds up for @xmath131 @xmath2 and then speeds down for @xmath132 until it becomes constant at large value of @xmath133 . on the other hand , for @xmath126 ( figure([figure2]@xmath128 ) ) there is no decelerating effect in the evolution process .",
    "the qslt for every choice of @xmath24 decreases monotonously until it reaches a nonvanishing minimum constant value that results in uniform evolution process .",
    "the effect of the width @xmath4 of the wavepacket for the same values of the time parameter @xmath24 as in figure ( [ figure2 ] ) on the qslt is shown in figure ( [ figure3 ] ) .",
    "again figure ( [ figure3]@xmath127 ) corresponds to @xmath134 and figure ( [ figure3]@xmath128 ) to @xmath126 .",
    "similarly , the solid and the dashed curves in both subfigures , respectively , represent the influence of ohmic and super - ohmic reservoirs .",
    "as in figure ( [ figure2]@xmath127 ) , here in figure ( [ figure3]@xmath127 ) also exists a critical value @xmath135 of the width of the wavepacket at which the qslt , regardless of the value of @xmath24 , reduces to a nonvanishing minimum value and then start increasing with the increasing value of @xmath4 .",
    "however , the comparison of the two figures immediately reveals that in figure ( [ figure3]@xmath127 ) the fall in qslt in the region @xmath136 is sharper than in figure ( [ figure2]@xmath127 ) .",
    "similarly , in the region @xmath137 the behavior of qslt is completely different than in figure ( [ figure2]@xmath127 ) . here is no saturation point , rather , beyond @xmath135",
    "there is a relatively slower increase , reaching a maximum that happens at the half of its initial value and then falls gradually to a nonvanishing value for each choice of @xmath24 . unlike the effect of @xmath4 for large @xmath115 , its effect for small @xmath115 ( figure([figure3]@xmath138 ) ) is to relatively slow down the decrease in qslt as compared to figure([figure2]@xmath128 )",
    "we investigate the effect of relative motion on the dynamics of quantum speed limit time for a single free spin@xmath0 particle initially in a superposition state and is coupled to an ohmic - like dephasing environment . in particular , the effects of rapidity , normalized momentum , the size of the wavepackets and the initial time parameter in the markovian regime both for ohmic and super - ohmic reservoirs are considered .",
    "it is found that in the presence of relative motion , the coupling with the ohmic reservoir constantly speeds up the evolution process without having an upper bound there by reducing the qslt to zero as the evolution time increases , whereas the coupling with super - ohmic reservoir has an upper limit on the speed at which the evolution process proceeds uniformly .",
    "the effect of rapidity on qslt is not alike for the whole range of the average momentum . in the range of small @xmath115",
    ", it decreases monotonically to a constant minimum . on the other hand , in the range of large @xmath115 a critical value of rapidity exists",
    "at which it reduces to a nonvanishing minimum and then increases back until it becomes stationary . although quantitatively different , the effect of the width of the wavepackets on qslt is qualitatively parallel in some respects to that of the rapidity both in the small and the large ranges of the values of @xmath115 in the intermediate range of values of the two parameters",
    ". nevertheless , in the limit of large values the analogy breaks , such that in the case of @xmath4 it again decreases after reaching a maximum .",
    "the results of our study may prove useful for exploring the speed of evolution of more complex quantum systems consists of many marginal system in the frame work of relativity that can be used in quantum information processing in the presence of noisy environment .",
