    "the phenomenon of the electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , when the optical properties of the media for the weak probe field are coherently controlled by the strong coupling field , has been extensively studied in the recent years and provided a number of attractive applications @xcite .",
    "the most prominent feature of eit is a spectacular reduction of the group velocity of light pulses in the resonant media @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling field with the definite polarization produces also the optical anisotropy for the probe field , which reveals itself in the electromagnetically induced birefringence and polarization rotation of the probe field @xcite . among the most promising applications of eit is the implementation of quantum memory @xcite . such memory based on the controlled adiabatic deceleration and acceleration of single - photon pulses in the resonant media",
    "was suggested in @xcite , and soon the possibility of storage of light pulses was realized in rubidium vapor in the experiment @xcite .",
    "the recent experiments @xcite on eit - based quantum memory demonstrate the continuously improving efficiency and fidelity .",
    "there are different ways to encode the single - photon qubit , for example , in two spectral components of the photon pulse , as it was recently proposed in @xcite , but the most natural way for qubit encoding is provided by the photon two polarization degrees of freedom , as it was implemented in the experiments @xcite . to store the photon polarization qubit its both polarization components must be effectively stopped in the medium , however the group velocities of these two components may differ essentially due to the optical anisotropy induced by the polarization of the coupling field .",
    "the experiments on eit are performed on the the three - level @xmath0-type systems with degenerate levels , which are in many cases the hyperfine structure components of alkali atoms degenerate in the projections of the atomic total angular momentum on the quantization axis .",
    "the theoretical treatment of eit on such levels involves the solution of the equations for the atomic density matrix and the number of elements of this matrix increases drastically with the increase of the level angular momentum values .",
    "the objective of the present article is to obtain the general expression for the linear susceptibility tensor at the frequency of the probe field , which describes the polarization properties of eit , and to study the dependence of the relative difference in the group velocities of the two polarization components of the probe field on the polarization of the coupling field .",
    "the essential point about this expression is that the susceptibility tensor may be easily calculated by means of standard matrix operations for the arbitrary polarization of the driving field and for the arbitrary values of the level angular momenta .",
    "we consider the weak probe field propagating along the sample axis @xmath1 with the carrier frequency @xmath2 , which is in resonance with the frequency @xmath3 of an optically allowed transition @xmath4 between the ground state @xmath5 and the excited state @xmath6 , and the strong coherent coupling field propagating in the same direction with the carrier frequency @xmath7 , which is in resonance with the frequency @xmath8 of an optically allowed transition @xmath9 between the long - lived state @xmath10 and the same excited state @xmath6 ( fig.1 ) . here",
    "@xmath5 , @xmath10 and @xmath6 are the values of the angular momenta of the levels .",
    "the electric field strength of the coupling field ( inside the sample as well as outside ) and that of the probe field incident on the sample border @xmath11 may be put down as follows : @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the constant amplitude and the unit polarization vector of the coupling field , while @xmath16 is the constant vector amplitude of the incident probe field . at some sample point",

    "initially the atoms are at the ground state @xmath40 the atomic density matrix being @xmath41 generally the atoms are at the equilibrium ground state with equally populated zeeman sublevels , however they may be prepared at some special state @xcite . in the linear approximation for the probe field",
