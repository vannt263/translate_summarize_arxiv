    "change in the effective feature selectivity with driving variance has been studied for the case of the leaky integrate - and - fire ( lif ) model @xcite . in the lif model ,",
    "the dynamics are linear until the voltage reaches an imposed threshold after which the voltage is immediately reset below threshold .",
    "thus , the lif contains no intrinsic excitability , and further , does not allow for the possibility that the system can cross threshold multiple times before spiking due to noisy inputs .",
    "this discontinous behavior with respect to spike initiation is not found in biological neurons .",
    "two simple models with more realistic spike initiation are the quadratic and exponential integrate - and - fire models ( qif and eif , respectively ) @xcite .",
    "both models are similar in spirit to the lif insofar as they replace the afterhyperpolarization mechanism with a discontinous jump , or after - spike reset , but the point of reset in these models occurs at the peak of the spike instead of at the threshold voltage .",
    "this mitigates the effects of the pathological behavior in response to noise that the discontinuity creates @xcite by moving it away from the interesting region of spike initiation .",
    "the models are described by an equation of the form : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the membrane voltage , @xmath2 is the membrane time constant , @xmath3 is the voltage that defines the spike height and @xmath4 is the post - spike reset voltage .",

    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ] we study parameters such that the resting potential is zero and the unstable fixed point is at @xmath11 for both models .",
    "this requires us to choose @xmath12 and @xmath13 . somewhat paradoxically ,",
    "despite the higher order nonlinearity , the choice of small @xmath14 causes the exponential nonlinearity to turn on over a much tighter range in voltage than the quadratic nonlinearity of the qif .",
    "we will see that this leads to more linear behavior of the eif model below threshold .",
    "thus the two models behave noticeably differently below threshold while still having the same after - spike dynamics .",
    "reverse correlation is used to determine characteristics of the stimulus that are correlated with neuronal response . from a long , random stimulus presentation @xmath5 and the resulting spike response times @xmath15 , one collects the set of @xmath16 current traces that led to a spike , @xmath17 , over an interval of time @xmath18 $ ] prior to the spike where @xmath19 is chosen appropriately to capture all the stimulus history that is relevant to triggering the spike .",
    "the _ spike - triggered average _ or sta , @xmath20 , is found by averaging these samples over @xmath21 : @xmath22      the results of reverse correlation analysis can depend on how the spike time is defined . here , we will look at the stas with a temporal resolution that is short compared to the average spike width .",
    "different choices of the voltage threshold used to define spikes will accordingly lead to stas that differ from each other due to temporal jittering of the ensemble of spike - triggered trajectories .",
    "because we want to understand how the spiking of the model determines the feature selected from the stimulus ensemble , we are interested in choosing a threshold that yields an sta that best captures the role of the stimulus on the approach to the spike but is not sensitive to stimulus - driven variations in the spike itself . for both models considered here , this is achieved by selecting the unstable fixed point that separates the subthreshold region from the spiking region in the absence of noise .",
    "since the location of the unstable fixed point is a function of the mean input current and the quadratic form of the nonlinearity , we will call it the _ dynamical threshold _ in accordance with previous work @xcite . for the zero - mean inputs considered here ,",
    "the dynamical threshold is @xmath23 .",
    "thus , we define spike times as the time of the last upward crossing of the dynamical threshold preceding an after - spike reset .      in discrete - time with time step @xmath24 ,",
    "the nonlinear models in equation [ eq : model ] were realized as : @xmath25 where the @xmath26 are drawn from a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "for all figures in this paper , simulations were run with a time step of @xmath27 until @xmath28 spikes were accumulated .",
    "the noise was generated with ` randn ` in matlab r2007b .",
    "parameters used in simulation : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "we computed the sta numerically for a range of values of the stimulus standard deviation @xmath35 for both models .",
    "results are shown in figure [ fig : stanum ] .",
    "the sta at all values of @xmath35 has two components : an extended feature and a sharp upward step at the time of the spike . for the feature ,",
    "two different types of behavior appear . for large @xmath35 ,",
    "the stas are approximately decaying exponentials for which , as the standard deviation increases , the decay timescale decreases and the amplitude increases .",
    "thus , at larger @xmath35 , the qif and eif models perform approximately linear leaky integration , where the effective leakiness depends on the standard deviation . for very small",
    "@xmath35 , the stas are non - monotonic , with the peak amplitude occurring well before the spike time .",
    "to best understand how details of the models influence the stas , we would like to be able to calculate the stas analytically .",
    "in the zero standard deviation limit , the sta can be analytically calculated for the qif via a large deviations principle and path integral methods @xcite , but that type of analysis does not extend to finite @xmath35 .",
    "however , path integral methods can be applied for arbitrary @xmath35 to perfectly linear models with no reset . as noted previously @xcite , the observation that the sta is an exponential implies that the subthreshold dynamics of the model are effectively linear .",
    "since the stas of the nonlinear models are roughly exponential for larger standard deviations , we should be able to introduce a linear approximation to the nonlinear models that captures the qualitative behavior of the sta and helps explain in detail how the sta arises from the form of the nonlinearity .",
    "the main idea is as follows .",
    "while it is impossible to derive complete , time - dependent statistical distributions for these models , we can get the steady - state distribution from the fokker - planck equation .",
    "this distribution gives us information about how the properties of the stimulus and spiking dynamics determine how the system samples its subthreshold nonlinearities .",
    "we will then use the steady - state distribution to map the nonlinear models onto linear models and thus compute an approximation to the sta . since the linear model follows from the steady - state distribution",
    ", we can think of the linear model as describing the `` time - averaged dynamics '' of the nonlinear models .",
    "a key ingredient for understanding the behavior of the spiking models and for determining an analytically tractable mapping of a nonlinear model to a linear model is the steady - state probability distribution for the voltage in response to an input with given statistical characteristics .",
    "this probability distribution , @xmath36 , can be computed from the fokker - planck equation @xcite , which for models of the form given in equation [ eq : model ] is : @xmath37+\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\tau_m}\\frac{\\partial^2p_n(v , t)}{\\partial v^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad + r(t)\\left[\\delta(v - v_r)-\\delta(v - v_{s})\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the time - dependent mean firing rate that needs to be determined self - consistently in solving the equation .",
    "this is a continuity equation for @xmath39 which expresses that the evolution of the distribution is driven by the deterministic nonlinear driving force , diffusion , and spiking .",
    "we are interested in the steady - state distribution , for which @xmath40 and @xmath38 goes to the mean rate @xmath41 . using standard methods @xcite , one can show that the steady state distribution is : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , and the mean firing rate is the normalization constant .",
    "this distribution is the product of a boltzmann factor , controlled entirely by the nonlinear dynamics , @xmath44 , preceding a spike , and a spiking flux term which carries the dependence on the spike parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "since we are mainly interested in behavior below the unstable fixed point , or dynamical threshold , and the models considered here have reset voltages , @xmath7 , near the resting potential , the contribution of the spiking flux term does not depend strongly on the form of @xmath44 , but does depend strongly on the location of @xmath7 .",
    "we turn to a set of techniques known as _",
    "stochastic linearization _",
    "( sl ) ( see @xcite for an extensive review ) to model and understand the behavior of the sta of the nonlinear models . in the sl approach , one seeks the parameters of a linear model that optimally capture the properties of the nonlinear model in a regime of interest . in our case , we are interested in the linear model that best captures the approach of a nonlinear model to threshold for a given input standard deviation , but we are unconcerned with the dynamics of the spike itself .",
    "thus , we search for an equivalent linear model of the form : @xmath45 where we make no attempt to model the spike or the reset @xcite .",
    "this linear model is simply an ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xcite , and it has the associated steady - state probability distribution : @xmath46 .",
    "\\label{eq : linstead}\\ ] ]    to determine the parameters of the optimal linear model , we must select an optimization function that maps the nonlinear model onto the linear model .",
    "there are no unique methods for choosing optimization functions that will yield good results @xcite , and different functions will generally yield different results .",
    "we focus on two optimization functions which give weight to different properties of the nonlinear model .",
    "the kullback - leibler divergence ( @xmath47 ) measures the similarity of two probability distributions @xcite . to map the nonlinear models to sets of linear models",
    ", we can use the @xmath47 to minimize the difference between the subthreshold part of the nonlinear steady - state distribution and the matched linear model s steady - state distribution .",
    "the @xmath47 for this problem is : @xmath48 to find the optimal linear model with this criterion , we minimize the @xmath47 with respect to @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "these expressions show that minimizing the @xmath47 amounts to simply estimating the mean and variance below threshold .",
    "this criterion is only sensitive to the probability distribution itself and has no knowledge of the underlying dynamics .",
    "an alternative optimization criterion is to optimize the mean square error in the energy , or first integral of the nonlinear models , below threshold .",

    "this criterion amounts to trying to match the boltzmann part of the distributions , taking spiking into account only through the bias it provides to the expectation value .",
    "this piece is primarily sensitive to the specifics of the dynamics below threshold and is less sensitive to the overall shape of the distribution than the @xmath47 is . minimizing @xmath58 yields : @xmath59e\\left[v^2\\right]-e\\left[vf(v)\\right]e\\left[v^3\\right]}{e\\left[v^4\\right]e\\left[v^2\\right]-e\\left[v^3\\right]^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ c_{\\sigma}&=&\\frac{e\\left[vf(v)\\right]e\\left[v^4\\right]-e\\left[v^2f(v)\\right]e\\left[v^3\\right]}{e\\left[v^4\\right]e\\left[v^2\\right]-e\\left[v^3\\right]^2}\\label{eq : ikc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] again , in the @xmath52 limit , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in this case",
    ", we see that the optimal parameters are directly sensitive to the form of the nonlinearity below threshold and that the shape of the probability distribution only enters through the expectation values .",
    "the two optimization criteria give different weights to different roles of the nonlinearity .",
    "the @xmath47 criterion is sensitive to the net statistical distribution below threshold , regardless of whether it comes about due to the spike or the subthreshold nonlinearity , whereas the energy criterion is primarily sensitive to the form of the subthreshold nonlinearity .",
    "accordingly , we can expect that the linear model , for a given nonlinear model and input standard deviation , found by the different criteria will be different . specifically , for nonlinear models whose optimal linear equivalents are best described by the energy criterion , the parameters @xmath49 and @xmath50 will be closely related to the form of the subthreshold nonlinearity but may not be very sensitive to the overall details of the voltage distribution below threshold .",
    "in contrast , for models with linear equivalents that are best described by the @xmath47 criterion , the parameters may have essentially no relation with the subthreshold nonlinearity , but rather describe global statistical properties set by the mean and variance of the voltage distribution .      to find the sta for the linear model and to compare to numerical simulations , we move to discrete - time by defining @xmath60 where @xmath61 is an integer and @xmath24",

    "we start at the spike time , @xmath69the first time for which @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the mean voltage at the spike time , @xmath72 , is given by : @xmath73 the spike - triggered voltage distribution , @xmath74 , follows from the threshold - crossing condition .",
    "the probability of finding a voltage @xmath75 at the spike time is given by the probability that @xmath75 is above @xmath76 , multiplied by the probability that @xmath75 was arrived at from voltages @xmath77 that were below threshold , summed over all possible subthreshold values of @xmath77 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the unconditioned distribution of voltages prior to the spike and is given by the steady state distribution in equation [ eq : linstead ] , @xmath80 is the forward transition distribution , @xmath81 is the heaviside function representing the probability for @xmath75 to be above threshold , and @xmath82 is the normalization constant .",
    "the mean voltage at the time immediately preceding the spike , @xmath83 , is determined by averaging over all voltages below threshold that can transition to voltages above threshold in the next time step , and can be found from @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the normalization constant for this distribution .",
    "similarly , the remaining @xmath86 for @xmath87 are given by : @xmath88    equation [ eq : stvdiscreet ] is exact for a linear model but is impractical to use . without noticeable loss of accuracy for the simulations considered in this paper ,",
    "numerous simplifications can be made .",
    "for a discussion of approximations to @xmath72 and @xmath83 , see the appendix .    via the central limit theorem ,",
    "the @xmath86 for @xmath89 can be simplified as : @xmath90 since these are all gaussian integrals over an infinite domain , the mean value is the most likely value and so the remaining averages are arrived at recursively to give : @xmath91 using the fact that @xmath92 , this recursion relation can be solved in terms of the exponential function and gives : @xmath93 \\quad \\text{for}\\quad n\\le -1.\\ ] ]    the sta immediately follows from equation [ eq : stadeflin ] , and is : @xmath94&n\\le-1 , \\\\",
    "\\end{cases } \\label{eq : stalin}\\ ] ] for the linear model , the sta is simply given by the exponential filter up to a singular piece at the spike time that arises from requiring that threshold be crossed from below .      for the qif ,",
    "the energy criterion qualitatively captures the time constant at all @xmath35 and correctly matches the amplitude of the sta at high @xmath35 ( see figures [ fig : stahigh]a and [ fig : distributions]c ) .",
    "conversely , the @xmath47 criterion is much less accurate .",
    "while it too predicts qualitatively correct time constants , the amplitude of the predicted stas is much too large ( not shown ) .",
    "this is because the @xmath47 criterion strongly weights the effects of the after - spike reset and total probability mass , and thus biases the resting potential of the linear model too far below threshold .",
    "thus , the sta for the qif is primarily determined by the form of the subthreshold nonlinearity and is less sensitive to the escape from the subthreshold domain due to spiking .",
    "figure [ fig : distributions]a shows how the optimal linear model relates to the subthreshold nonlinearity in this case .    for the eif",
    ", however , the energy criterion gives @xmath95 for all @xmath35 . while this is not surprising given the effectively linear subthreshold dynamics , it does not agree with the numerics . the @xmath47 criterion , on the other hand , applied to the eif leads to qualitative agreement between the linear models and numerics ( see figures [ fig : stahigh]b and [ fig : distributions]d ) .",
    "this confirms the idea that the changes in the sta in the eif can only be due to the reduction in the time spent below threshold because of spiking , and that the small amount of nonlinearity below threshold for the parameters used is not relevant except at small @xmath35 ( see figure [ fig : distributions]b for further discussion ) .",
    "these changes in the sta are analogous to those studied previously by paninski @xcite .",
    "the singular upward step at the spike time arises from the condition that threshold must be crossed from below  that @xmath96 must be positive  to elicit a spike @xcite .",
    "this `` delta - function '' component , shown in figures [ fig : stanum]c and [ fig : stanum]d , appears here so prominently because we have chosen the spike - defining threshold to be at a voltage for which the stimulus is still relevant to spiking .",
    "this step does not vanish in the continuous - time limit .",
    "the value of the step can be calculated approximately ( see appendix ) with good agreement with simulation data ( see figure [ fig : stadelta ] ) .",
    "this mode occasionally appears in experimental stas when the spike waveform is slow ( r. mease , personal communication ) .",
    "it is usually not seen because the threshold is generally drawn well into the intrinsically excitable domain of the voltage and so a condition on @xmath96 does not significantly constrain the stimulus in that situation .",
    "due to nonlinearity , ln characterizations of neural systems show dependence on stimulus statistics , even without changes in the underlying dynamical parameters @xcite . in particular , by changing only the input standard deviation , the effective computation changes its functional form and timescale .",
    "we have explored the consequences of this for two reduced naturally - spiking neuron models , the quadratic and exponential integrate - and - fire models . in determining the linear filter or filters characterizing the model ,",
    "our work differs significantly from previous approaches @xcite in that the point of linearization is not taken , as is classically done , to be the equilibrium point ; rather , we allow the subthreshold voltage distribution to determine the optimal point of linearization .",
    "this distribution carries information about the form of the nonlinearities , the mean firing rate , and the stimulus itself .",
    "these properties account for changes in the effective linear model with stimulus variance .",
    "we find that despite these models superficial similarities , different mechanisms are primarily responsible for this form of adaptation .",
    "the key difference between the models is that the qif is nonlinear below threshold , qualitatively corresponding to a neuron with hyperpolarizing currents that are activated below threshold , while the eif is mostly linear below threshold .",
    "both models have been successfully fit to neuronal data from a variety of neuron types @xcite .",
    "thus , both the neuron s intrinsic properties and the statistics of the background or of the driving stimulus ensemble determine the effective filtering properties of the system .",
    "this shows one means by which modulating the statistics of the input can effectively gate the transmission of different types of input or stimulus features through the system @xcite .",
    "while this analysis focused on very simple model neurons , the methods we describe generalize to more complex , higher dimensional neuronal models , although analytical solutions are unlikely .",
    "these simple examples give a clear insight into intrinsic modulation of feature selectivity .",
    "our previous treatments of this problem @xcite concentrated on the case where spikes are well - separated , so that the effects of spike history are explicitly separated from the role of the stimulus in determining the probability of generating a spike . another approach to this problem is to include an explicit spike - history term in the generative model @xcite . here , the spike history is incorporated into the computation of features due to the effects of the mean firing rate on the steady - state distribution of threshold escape and reset .",
