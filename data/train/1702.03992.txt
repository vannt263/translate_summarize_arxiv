    "due to brownian motion , it is impossible to keep a molecule within the detection volume for an extended period of time .",
    "the study of nanofluidics became popular to circumvent this problem with wide scientific applications @xcite . with the advancement of nanotechnologies , nanofluidic devices comprising arrays of nanochannels with diameters",
    "less than hundred nanometres have become significant for bioanalytical diagnostics applications , such as dna optical mapping @xcite , single virus and nanoparticle detection @xcite .",
    "nanochannels are useful tools allowing systematic studies of entities from single molecule to viruses over long periods of time .",
    "it can induce 1d fluidic confinement by suppressing the thermal motions in two directions .",
    "the primary problem is to establish a simple and efficient way of nanofabricating 1d nanofluidic channels .",
    "different methods have been published , which described the fabrication processes of such nanofluidic devices @xcite .",
    "however , majority of them are technically challenging , costly , and not easily applicable for high - throughput production .",
    "hence , we present a cost - effective and simple nanofabrication technique based on electron beam lithography ( ebl ) and shadow - angle - electron - beam - deposition ( saebd ) .    the nanochannels were used to detect a flow of photoluminescent nanomaterials , such as small dna molecules labelled with single organic fluorophores , carbon nanodots ( cnd ) @xcite , and pure organic fluorophores . using two - focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( 2ffcs ) @xcite , we recorded the transits of single molecules or nanodots through the nanochannels , and quantitatively analysed their flow velocities . here",
    ", the detection regions were two diffraction limited focal spots with a lateral displacement of 400 nm . to ensure 1d tranport between the two foci , the diameter of the nanochannels should be smaller than the focal diameters .",
    "the nanochannels presented here have diameters ranging from 30 nm to 100 nm , which are smaller than the focal diameter .",
    "the process steps to create an enclosed nanochannels involve  nanofabrication of open nanochannels using ebl and rie and enclosing them using saebd . the ballistic path of the electron beam ( e - beam ) assisted evaporation @xcite is the principle behind saebd .",
    "when a straight beam of depositing material hits onto an open nano - trench at shallow incident angles , no deposition occurs in the shadowed region @xcite",
    ". such deposition can enclose a large number of parallel nanochannels ( depending on the e - beam diameter ) leaving the shadowed region as the fluidic path of interest .",
    "the process is unaffected by nanometre sized leftover residues of the e - beam resists and does not require an atomically clean surface , unlike any wafer bonding process @xcite . for optical reasons ,",
    "the final nanochannels were prepared using pure silicon dioxide .",
    "being an insulator silica contributes to surface charging under e - beam which affects ebl and sem .",

    "the vertical thickness of the titanium film is 47.8 nm .",
    "considering the uncertainty of few nanometres deposition thickness , this agrees well with our expectation .",

    "<S> one - dimensional ( 1d ) discrete flow of nanoscale objects is an efficient approach in this direction . </S>",
    "<S> the development of simple and cost - effective nanofluidic devices is a critical step to realise 1d flow . </S>",
    "<S> this letter presents a nanofabrication technique using shadow - angle - electron - beam - deposition for a high - throughput preparation of parallel nanofluidic channels . these were used to flow and detect small fragments of dna , carbon - nanodots , and organic fluorophores . </S>",
    "<S> the 1d molecular mass transport was performed using electro - osmotic flow . </S>",
    "<S> the 1d flow behaviour was analysed using two - focus fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( 2ffcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> a range of flow velocities of single molecules was achieved  from 15 @xmath0 m/s to 290 @xmath0 m/s . </S>",
    "<S> the transitions of single molecules or nanodots through the two foci were quantitatively analysed using confocal scanning fluorescence microscopy , correlative photon detection , and burst size distribution analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest an efficient nanofabrication technique is developed to prepare nanofluidic devices . </S>",
    "<S> this first demonstration of high - throughput nanochannel fabrication process and using 2ffcs - based single molecule flow detection should have potential impact on ultra - sensitive biomedical diagnostics and studying biomolecular interactions as well as nanomaterials . </S>"
