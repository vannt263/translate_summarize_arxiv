    "they are indeed molded by the photospheric structure and for this reason can tell us about its thermal , magnetic and dynamical properties .",
    "when considering stokes profiles measured in spectral lines that are sensible to magnetic fields via zeeman effect , one could expect the circular polarization profiles ( @xmath0 ) to be exactly antisymmetric with respect to a central wavelength of the transition , possibly shifted by plasma dynamics , and @xmath10 ) , profiles are expected to be symmetric ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "contrary to such an idealization , the stokes  @xmath0 profiles emerging from the solar photosphere present important asymmetries independently of whether the measurements are obtained with low spatial resolution ( e.g. , in plage or network regions ; for a review see * ? ? ?",

    "stokes  @xmath0 profile asymmetries are well known to be generated by gradients along and across the los of both magnetic field and plasma dynamics . moreover , to deal with strong asymmetries one can not consider mild variations of the above cited quantities , instead fairly large changes like discontinuities have to be invoked ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the asymmetries are also partly caused by discontinuities across the los , in other words , an important factor which can introduce asymmetries is the finite spatial resolution of observations .",

    "the dataset has been already analyzed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to derive the magnetic properties of in and network regions .",
    "consistently with these works , here we focus on stokes  @xmath0 profiles whose maximum amplitude is larger than @xmath23 .",
    "a total of @xmath24 stokes  @xmath0 profiles meet the selection criteria ( i.e. , @xmath25  % of the total number of profiles in the dataset ) .",
    "such a large number of profiles can be rightly considered a complete set of polarization signals representative of the different stokes  @xmath0 profiles that can be observed in the quiet sun at disk center with @xmath3  arcsec resolution and @xmath4 polarimetric sensitivity .",
    "the analysis consists of three main parts .",
    "the most important one is the ` k - means ` classification of the profiles .",
    "this allows us to infer the typical profile shapes from the dataset described in   [ data ] .",
    "besides the classification , we derived the los velocity for each pixel in the fov adopting a fourier transform method applied to both stokes  @xmath9 lines separately @xcite , and the center - of - gravity magnetogram signal from stokes @xmath9 and @xmath0 ( cog , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the ` k - means ` classification algorithm is commonly used in data mining , machine learning , and artificial intelligence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , the procedure we use is the same as the one used by @xcite to analyze galaxy spectra from the sloan digital survey data release 7 . in this work",
    "the authors defined the procedure as _ automatic _ and _ unsupervised_. `` unsupervised '' implies that the algorithm does not have to be trained , whereas `` automatic '' means that it is self - contained , with minimal subjective influence . in the standard formulation , ` k - means ` begins by selecting at random from the full dataset of @xmath0 spectra a number @xmath26 of template spectra .",
    "each template spectrum is assumed to be the center of a cluster , and each spectrum of the data set is assigned to the closest cluster center ( i.e. , that of minimum distance or , equivalently , closest in a least - squares sense ) .",
    "once all spectra in the dataset were classified , the cluster center is re - computed as the average of the spectra in the cluster .",
    "this procedure is iterated with the new cluster centers , and it finishes when no spectrum is re - classified in two consecutive steps .",
    "the number of clusters @xmath26 is arbitrarily chosen but , in practice , the results are insensitive to this selection because only a few clusters possess a significant number of members , so that the rest can be discarded . on exit ,",
    "the algorithm provides a number of clusters , their corresponding cluster centers , as well as the classification of all the original spectra now assigned to one of the clusters .",
    "the classes are ordered according to the total number of profiles they contain , i.e. , assigning @xmath27 to the most abundant , @xmath12 to the second most abundant , and so on .    as a major drawback , `",
    "k - means ` yields different clusters with each random initialization , therefore , one has to study this dependence by carrying out different random initializations and comparing their results . partly trying to alleviate this problem",
    ", the code we employ uses an initialization more refined than the plain random initialization .",
    "it consists of four steps : ( step 1 ) choose at random ten initial cluster centers ; ( step 2 ) run one iteration of the standard ` k - means ` , and select as initial cluster center the cluster center with the largest number of elements ; ( step 3 ) remove from the set of profiles to be classified those belonging to the cluster center thus selected ; ( step 4 ) go to step 1 if profiles are still left ; otherwise end . in order to show that the method is working properly , in   [ results ]",
    "we present the results obtained from a single classification run and then validate them by showing that they fully agree with the average results obtained when performing ten classification runs initialized with different random conditions .",
    "an important point to be mentioned is that the classes provided by ` k - means ` do not form an orthogonal basis in the principal component analysis sense ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the individual profiles are not unique linear superpositions of the cluster center profiles .",
    "indeed , among the clusters found by the analysis , similar profiles can be easily recognized ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "however , it is important to specify that the aim of our classification is not to provide orthogonal classes , but to point out the typical shapes of the profiles observed by sot / sp in the quiet sun . the most important point to keep in mind",
    "is that all profiles associated to a given class are similar to the cluster profile representative of the class and , therefore , the cluster profiles are effectively representative of the shapes of the profiles observed by sot / sp . referring to the similarity between each cluster profile and the profiles associated to it , it is worth pointing out that profiles strongly deviating from the cluster center are discarded . in more detail , when the cluster centers are calculated as the average of the profiles in the class , those members with a distance larger than three times the standard deviation are rejected .",
    "given a set of observations , the actual data to be classified can be chosen in different ways ( e.g. , range of wavelengths to be included , or whether the profiles are corrected for the magnetic polarity ) . here",
    "we explain the way our dataset was defined and why .",
    "the main idea is to analyze exclusively the shape of stokes  @xmath0 .",
    "for this reason we remove the global shift of the profiles , renormalize each profile to its maximum unsigned value , and sign the profiles according to the main polarity in the resolution element .",
    "each profile is normalized to its maximum absolute amplitude as @xmath28 where @xmath29 spans over the whole wavelength range of sot / sp ( i.e. , @xmath30  nm around @xmath31  nm . ) .",
    "global wavelength shifts are removed separately for the two spectral lines .",
    "we extract the stokes  @xmath0 profiles of the two lines in two wavelength windows that are centered around the corresponding stokes  @xmath9 line cores .",
    "the two wavelength windows have the same amplitude , i.e. @xmath32  pm , so that both lines _ contribute _ to the classification with the same number of wavelength pixels . in this procedure",
    "the number of wavelength pixels is reduced from @xmath33 to @xmath34 ( i.e. , two windows of @xmath35 wavelength pixels each ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that after this step it is not possible to consider a common wavelength range for the representation of stokes  @xmath0 profiles of the two lines .",
    "for this reason , the abscissas of our stokes  @xmath0 profiles are given in pixel units rather than wavelengths ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .    finally , we individually sign the profiles according to the polarity that dominates stokes  @xmath0 , so that if @xmath0 were perfectly antisymmetric , the polarity - corrected stokes  @xmath0 would have a positive blue lobe and a negative red lobe . since the signals are not antisymmetric , we define _ dominant polarity _ as that yielding a @xmath0 with the sign of the largest average signal in the profile . in practice , we average stokes  @xmath0 separately in the red - wing and the blue - wing to decide which wing dominates .",
    "the division between red and blue is set by the stokes  @xmath9 line core wavelengths . if the ( unsigned )",
    "blue - wing signal is largest , then we divide stokes  @xmath0 by its sign .",
    "if the ( unsigned ) red - wing signal is largest , then we divide stokes  @xmath0 by minus its sign . the result is a @xmath0 profile with the largest signal positive if it happens in the blue - wing , and negative if happens in the red - wing ( see the profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for illustration ) .",
    ") of the pixels associated with each family of stokes @xmath0 shapes .",
    "each plot contains the histograms of both  630.15  nm ( thick lines ) and  630.25  nm ( thin lines ) .",
    "the histograms are normalized to the total number of profiles in the family .",
    "the vertical dotted lines separate the upflow regime ( left ) and the downflow regime ( right).[fig4],width=264 ]    the main result of the ` k - means ` classification is reported in fig .",
    "it shows the cluster centers for all classes of profiles existing in the quiet sun .",
    "after several trial classifications , we set the maximum number of allowed classes to @xmath36 , which exceeds the typical number of classes retrieved by the procedure ( i.e. , around @xmath5 , see table  [ table ] ) . in this way",
    "we are sure that the classification procedure is automatically setting the number of classes . the classification performed on the dataset of @xmath24 profiles took about @xmath37  min on a standard laptop .",
    "we number the classes according to the percentage of observed profiles belonging to the class , from the most common , ` class  0 ` , to the least common , ` class  34 ` .",
    "it is important to notice that strongly asymmetric profiles are found throughout , e.g. , the second most populated class shows important asymmetries .",
    "classes of stokes  @xmath0 with three lobes ( @xmath8-like profiles ) are also common , meaning that profiles like this are not isolated cases in quiet sun measurements .    as already reported in ",
    "[ analysis ] , similar profile shapes can be recognized among the cluster profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . indeed , attending to their basic properties",
    "the profiles can be grouped in six families : network , blue - lobe , red - lobe , @xmath8-like , asymmetric , and antisymmetric ( partially following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with basic properties we refer to the major features of profiles , e.g. , blue - lobe profiles have a very small red lobe so that , independently of the amount of polarization in the blue lobe , they are dominated by the blue lobe itself .",
    "the first family , i.e. , the network one , can be defined by calculating the statistics for the ` k - means ` classes when network and in regions are considered separately , i.e. , for the pixels included / not - included in the red contours of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . the contours separate network and in regions in the fov .",
    "network patches were identified with the algorithm used in @xcite .",
    "we refer to this work for details , but it basically selects the patches with the largest polarization signals that all together cover some @xmath13  % of the fov . ) . ]",
    "the statistics is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , here the network classes are pointed out by arrows .",
    "more in detail , the network - in division performed by the routine has an equivalent division in the ` k - means ` classes .",
    "indeed , the classes that are abundant in the network ( i.e. , those pointed out by the arrows ) are scarce in the in , and vice - versa .",
    "these results imply that the network is associated with particular stokes  @xmath0 shapes that are not found elsewhere . in other words , a classical network identification and the `",
    "k - means ` classification point out the same regions with two different methods : the first one is mainly based on the analysis of the spatial coherence of strong stokes  @xmath0 signals , whereas the second one does not take into account the amplitude of stokes  @xmath0 ( profiles are normalized before classification , see   [ dataarch ] ) , and refers just to profile shapes .",
    "the `` network family '' contains the following group of ` k - means ` classes : ` classes  0 ` , ` 3 ` , ` 4 ` , ` 6 ` , ` 7 ` , ` 12 ` , and ` 19 ` ( the cluster profiles of these classes are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] with purple error bars ) .",
    "these are representative of about @xmath38  % of the total number of analyzed pixels . by examining the shapes of the clusters in the network family",
    "one can notice that these profiles present the blue lobe larger than the red one , while the latter is more extended in wavelength ( its area is larger than the area of the blue lobe ) .",
    "such a shape is well known to be associated to network regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the amplitude of the stokes  @xmath0 profiles in the two lines is very similar in all network classes ; this highlights the fact that a saturation due to kg fields is present , as expected in network regions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as explained above , each profile emerging from _ hinode _ pixels with sufficient signal is associated to a class and , by grouping of classes through a certain criteria , to a family . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we identify the position of a network profile with a purple pixel .",
    "the map shows how the network contours highlight large purple patches .",
    "on the other hand , clusters profiles in in pixels present a huge variety of asymmetries . as an example , ` class  1 ` , the most abundant class in the in , is represented by a cluster profile dominated by the blue lobe .",
    "many other classes are represented by profiles dominated by a single lobe , either the blue one or the red one ( here always negative because of the condition imposed in   [ dataarch ] ) .",
    "the profiles in these classes represent approximately @xmath39  % of the analyzed pixels . among these ,",
    "@xmath40  % are the profiles dominated by the blue lobe , named the `` blue - lobe family '' , i.e. , ` class  1 ` , ` 5 ` , ` 10 ` , ` 15 ` , and ` 28 ` ( represented with blue error bars in fig .  [ fig1 ] and blue pixels in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) and @xmath41  % by the red lobe , named the `` red - lobe family '' , i.e. , ` 17 ` , ` 21 ` , ` 23 ` , and ` 24 ` ( represented with red error bars in fig .  [ fig1 ] and",
    "red pixels in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , a third family of extremely asymmetric profiles can be defined ; ` class  25 ` , ` 26 ` , ` 30 ` , ` 31 ` , ` 33 ` , and ` 34 ` ( represented with sky - blue error bars in fig .  [ fig1 ] and",
    "sky - blue pixels in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) form the `` @xmath8-like family '' , which contains @xmath42  % of the total number of analyzed pixels .",
    "the classes still not considered are in profiles presenting shapes that are not clearly among the three families defined above . in spite of this",
    ", many of these profiles still present evident asymmetries ; the `` asymmetric family '' is formed by the ` class  2 ` , ` 8 ` , ` 11 ` , ` 13 ` , ` 14 ` , ` 16 ` , ` 18 ` , ` 22 ` , ` 27 ` , and ` 32 ` which are @xmath43  % of the analyzed profiles ( represented with green error bars in fig .  [ fig1 ] and green pixels in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "finally , only two classes show almost antisymmetric profiles ; these represent only @xmath44  % of the dataset ( i.e. , ` class 9 ` and ` 20 ` ) and are named the `` antisymmetric family '' ( represented with yellow error bars in fig .  [ fig1 ] and",
    "yellow pixels in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "another interesting result comes from the study of the position of the families on the fov .",
    "this can be done , for example , by studying the los velocity ( @xmath45 ) for the pixels associated to each family .",
    "pixels with @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) are placed in granules ( intergranular lanes ) , i.e. , upflow regions ( downflow regions ) .",
    "[ fig4 ] contains the result of such a study when calculating the statistics of @xmath45 ( as derived by stokes @xmath9 , see   [ analysis ] ) for the pixels included in the six families defined above .",
    "the main result derived from this study is that each family is related to a certain dynamics .",
    "this is very revealing because the classification procedure does not know anything about @xmath45 because wavelength shifts were removed when extracting stokes  @xmath0 profiles in the wavelength windows centered around stokes @xmath9 cores (   [ dataarch ] ) . from this one",
    "learns that the plasma dynamics , as derived from stokes @xmath9 , i.e. , the dynamics mostly associated to the non magnetized plasma in the pixel , is in some way related the shape of stokes  @xmath0 profiles .",
    "one can elaborate a bit more on this result .",
    "the separation between the families with one lobe only ( i.e. , the blue - lobe and the red - lobe ) is evident .",
    "on the one hand , profiles dominated by the blue lobe are mostly found in upflow regions , i.e. , on top of the granules . on the other hand , profiles dominated by the red lobe",
    "are mostly found in downflow regions , i.e. , intergranular lanes .",
    "the @xmath8-like , network , and asymmetric families are found in downflow regions .",
    "antisymmetric profiles are found in both upflow and downflow pixels with almost the same probability .",
    "overall , as expected , most of the polarization signals reside in downflows , i.e. , @xmath48  % of the analyzed pixels .",
    "different families are also associated with different spatial extents .",
    "when calculating the area of the largest patch in the fov formed , exclusively , by profiles of the particular family one finds that network patches , mainly associated with ` class  3 ` and ` 4 ` , can reach dimensions up to few tens arcsec@xmath2 .",
    "all other families have typical patch dimensions of few tenths of @xmath12  arcsec@xmath2 ( see for a comparison the detail image in fig .  [ fig2 ] in which contour highlighting the granular scale",
    "are reported ) .",
    "this means that out of network regions the profile shape of the analyzed profiles change over very small scales , smaller than the typical granular scale .",
    "the results presented in this section were derived from a single ` k - means ` classification run . as specified in   [ analysis ] it is important to study the dependence of the results on different random initializations .",
    "to do this , we derived the average abundances of the different families from ten classification runs ; table  [ table ] allows one to compare the average results with those presented above . from this",
    "we can conclude that the results presented are sound and that the classification does not depend on the random initialization .",
    "the only class we did not consider so far in the presentation of the results is ` class  29 ` , representative of @xmath49  % of the analyzed profiles .",
    "this can be considered a fake class since it contains anomalous profiles . here",
    "we define as anomalous , for example , those profiles on which the procedure adopted for the definition of the input dataset (   [ dataarch ] ) did not work properly .",
    "a single fake class is found in all the classification runs ; this is always representative of about @xmath12  % of the analyzed profiles .",
    "this can be verified also in table  [ table ] , indeed by adding up the percentages from all families one gets @xmath50  % of the analyzed profiles .",
    ".single run results vs. average results[table ] [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "an important point to emphasize is that the number of ` k - means ` classes representative of all the profiles observed by sot / sp ( @xmath51 ) is small compared to the total number of profiles in the analyzed dataset ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "moreover , when the major features of the classes are considered , the analyzed profiles can be organized in six families ( i.e. , network , blue - lobe , red - lobe , @xmath8-like , asymmetric , and antisymmetric ) so that a few shape typologies can represent sot / sp quiet sun data . nevertheless , it is important to note that almost all these shapes are strongly asymmetric .",
    "most sot / sp data have been so far interpreted through me codes @xcite , but the ` k - means ` classes in fig .  [ fig1 ] show that such an hypothesis has to be replaced to analyze the whole variety of profile shapes observed by sot / sp in the quiet sun . except for the classes whose",
    "profile shapes can be reasonably considered to be quasi - antisymmetric ( see   [ results ] ) , we can conclude that me codes can not reproduce the observed profiles observed by sot / sp .",
    "@xcite recently showed that me codes can be used to derive average properties of fully resolved magnetized atmospheres ( technically speaking with magnetic filling factors equal to @xmath12 ) even when inverting extremely asymmetric profiles .",
    "this good news does not eliminate the need for more refined inversions .",
    "the asymmetries provide information on the unresolved structure and/or gradients along the los of the magnetic field that are washed out unless the line shapes are adequately interpreted . moreover",
    ", the present angular resolutions do not grant treating all in magnetic features as fully resolved .",
    "these considerations can be used in a constructive way when thinking about future strategies for the interpretation of spectropolarimetric data either from _ hinode _ or from future telescopes .",
    "one needs different hypotheses in order to interpret ( and fit ) the different polarization profiles emerging from the quiet sun . as an example , let us consider two extreme cases from our ` k - means ` classification , e.g. , ` class  9 ` and ` class  25 ` .",
    "the first one , quasi - antisymmetric , can be interpreted adopting me hypotheses .",
    "the second one is a class that , for example , could be interpreted in terms of mixed polarities in a single pixel of _ hinode _ , i.e. , with a two magnetic component model atmosphere .",
    "recently , @xcite put forward an inversion procedure based on bayesian techniques .",
    "this procedure follows directly from the approach adopted in @xcite , based exclusively on me hypothesis .",
    "the new code is able to automatically recognize the simplest model , from those provided by the user that can reproduce the examined polarization profiles .",
    "in other words , the code recognizes the minimum degree of complexity of a model atmosphere needed to reproduce the observations .",
    "this means that different inversion hypotheses can be used in a single inversion procedure . from our point of view",
    "such an approach is extremely promising because it allows to avoid an a - priori choice of hypotheses for the description of the solar photosphere that , in some cases , can turn out to be wrong in reproducing observations .    among",
    "the profile shapes in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] many single lobe profiles can be recognized .",
    "namely , according to the definition adopted in @xcite , @xmath52  % of the analyzed profiles are blue - lobe - only , while @xmath41  % are red - lobe - only .",
    "such extremely asymmetric profiles have been the object of recent studies @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors pointed out two models to produce such profiles : the canopy model and the embedded magnetic flux tube model .",
    "both models are characterized by a discontinuity along the los between the field - free component and the magnetized one .",
    "the main conclusion of this work is that both models are able to reproduce the observed asymmetries .",
    "more in detail , the canopy model needs an appropriate temperature stratification to produce strong asymmetries while the embedded magnetic flux tube model is able to produce them with a standard quiet sun temperature stratification .    the importance of the thermal properties of the solar atmosphere in the formation of strongly asymmetric profiles is also highlighted in @xcite as one of the main conclusions of the paper in which a canopy configuration under me hypotheses is considered . from this study",
    "it follows that a temperature inversion , causing an emission in the magnetized layer , is needed at the magnetopause of the canopy to produce blue - lobe - only profiles in upflow regions as observed in @xcite and in our analysis . besides this case",
    ", also @xmath8-like profiles can be produced thanks to emission processes in the magnetized layer . in @xcite",
    "the author reported a complete atlas of asymmetric profiles produced with a canopy configuration .",
    "in @xcite stokes  @xmath0 profiles emerging from a micro - loop smaller than the resolution element of the observations are also discussed . with such a figure",
    "one can explain the formation of both blue - lobe - only and red - lobe - only profiles and the correlation of these two families with the photospheric dynamics .",
    "the micro - loop model implicates the presence of a loop in the resolution element , i.e. , two opposite polarities corresponding to the legs ( footpoints ) of the loop . considering this figure ,",
    "@xmath8-like profiles can be easily produced , moreover , it can be shown that a suppression of the blue ( red ) lobe in the emerging profiles in correspondence of downflows ( upflows ) can be obtained .",
    "similarly to what was found for the canopy model , one can imagine the definition of an atlas of asymmetric profiles from the micro - loop model .",
    "any modification of the internal dynamics of the micro loop can influence the lobe cancellation leading either to a @xmath8-like profile or to a profile partially dominated by a blue / red lobe as those we found in the classification .    from our discussion",
    "it follows that adopting either a model with a magnetopause along the los or a micro - loop model one could , in principle , reproduce a large part of the profiles observed in the quiet sun by sot / sp .    we have to point out that the micro - loop model was introduced by @xcite for the interpretation of @xmath12  arcsec angular resolution spectropolarimetric data presented in @xcite .",
    "this is an important point because the micro - loop is supposed to be contained in the resolution element of the observation .",
    "sot / sp angular resolution is @xmath53  arcsec , i.e. , three times smaller than that of the dataset analyzed in @xcite , but still many strong asymmetries compatible with the micro - loop model emerge in quiet sun polarimetric measurements .",
    "the possible presence of micro - loops in the _ hinode _ resolution element is of big interest for the solar community . indeed ,",
    "such a figure is in close connection with many recent works that have been dedicated to the study of loop emergence events in the quiet sun as detected by _ hinode _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as an example , in @xcite stokes  @xmath0 profiles observed in correspondence with a loop emergence event are reported ; at the beginning of the process a single blue - lobe profile is found . in the same work the authors presented preliminary inversions of single lobe profiles performed through a model atmosphere characterized by a strong discontinuity in the stratification ( as in a canopy model of",
    "this analysis and that by @xcite are based on sirjump , a modified version of sirgauss , which is able to deal with discontinuities along the los . in - depth analyses of single - lobe profiles observed by _ hinode _ via the sirjump code are ongoing @xcite .    a last possible scenario for reproducing the variety of stokes  @xmath0 asymmetries observed in the quiet sun is the misma scenario , i.e. , a micro - structured magnetized atmosphere @xcite . in this model",
    "the solar atmosphere is thought to be composed by many optically thin magnetized components with different plasma dynamics embedded in a field - free gas .",
    "these components naturally arise from the interplay between convection and magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite correctly considered mismas as a generalization of the model they proposed when considering many transients along the los .",
    "here we point out that in the misma formulation also mixed polarity ( loop - like ) models are required @xcite .",
    "namely , they are needed to explain the @xmath8-like profiles and many of the one - lobe profiles .",
    "the misma hypothesis has been recently adopted to provide the first interpretation of the asymmetries of _ hinode _ quiet sun profiles @xcite .",
    "one of the main results presented in this work is the plenitude of mixed polarity pixels , i.e. , @xmath54  % of the in profiles .",
    "this value is three times the abundance of @xmath8-like profiles found here .",
    "however , mixed polarity profiles could be present in principle in many other classes that present extreme asymmetries .",
    "as an example , ` class  1 ` ( @xmath55  % ) could contain mixed polarity pixels .    from the above discussion",
    "it follows that different models / hypotheses can be used for the interpretation of the strongly asymmetric polarization profiles observed by sot / sp and , usually , different models are associated to different inversion codes . among these , the misma inversion code @xcite is the only one so far used for the interpretation of asymmetries in sot / sp data , and it turns out to be suitable for the interpretation of all the profile shapes highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] @xcite . from our point of view",
    ", different and independent interpretations from different analysis methods can be a key factor to clarify the physical picture behind the asymmetries recently measured in the quiet sun .",
    "the approach adopted by @xcite clearly goes in this direction .    by comparing the results of our classification with previous studies on the shapes of stokes @xmath0 profiles in the quiet sun",
    "we note that the amount of strongly asymmetric profiles seems to increase with the spatial resolution of observations . here",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for a comparison . in both papers ,",
    "spectropolarimetric observations were performed through the advanced stokes polarimeter ( asp ) with a spectral sampling of approximately @xmath56  pm pixel@xmath16 , a polarimetric sensitivity on the order of @xmath57 , and an angular resolution of about @xmath12  arcsec . from their respective analyses",
    "the authors obtained similar results on the abundance of strongly asymmetric profiles . referring to (",
    "4 ) one concludes that roughly @xmath58  % of the analyzed profiles considerably deviate from antisymmetric shapes ; in @xcite the percentage is of about @xmath13  % in the quiet sun .",
    "these abundances are at least a half the abundance we obtained ( around @xmath5  % , in agreement with * ? ? ?",
    "* who analyzed the same dataset ) .",
    "we note that both the spectral sampling and the polarimetric sensitivity provided by asp are suitable to go into the details of stokes @xmath0 shapes .",
    "moreover , the methods adopted by the authors to study the stokes @xmath0 shapes can be regarded as reliable . in spite of this , from sot",
    "/ sp measurements with @xmath53  arcsec angular resolution and @xmath4 polarimetric sensitivity we find an increase in the abundance of strongly asymmetric profiles .",
    "this result is not surprising if we refer to the typical dimension of the patches associated to the in families of our classification , i.e. , few tenths of @xmath12  arcsec . from this",
    "it follows that strong asymmetries are usually found over small scales .",
    "this fully agrees with the conclusions of @xcite , in which the authors report that _ `` the broad scatter in the @xmath0-parameters for the weakest @xmath0 signals can be interpreted as a dramatic increase in the dynamic behaviour with decreasing size ( and fill factor ) of magnetic elements''_. it is very important to remember that most of the in pixels were overlooked in our analysis because of the selection criteria on the stokes @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "this could in principle strongly affect the dimension of the patches associated to each in family . indeed , by considering stokes signals close to the sot / sp noise level would considerably increase the number of asymmetric profiles and affect the properties of in family patches .",
    "another result in agreement with @xcite is the difference in the dynamical properties of the blue - lobe family and red - lobe family , respectively . with respect to this , one has to remember that the dynamical properties in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] were derived exclusively from stokes @xmath9 profiles so that it is probably too optimistic to state that different dynamical properties of the non magnetized plasma can give rise to different stokes @xmath0 shapes .",
    "rather , we can think about different field - free dynamics associated to certain atmospheric configurations that are typical either of granules or intergranular lanes ( as discussed above ) .    as a final remark",
    ", we now discuss two possible applications of the set of ` k - means ` profiles reported in fig .",
    "the first one is the definition of a set of profiles that can be used to check whether the profiles synthesized from mhd simulations can be confidently considered to be representative of the profiles observed by _",
    "hinode_. as an example , in @xcite muram local dynamo simulation magnetic fields turn out to be extremely variable in polarity over very small scales .",
    "this implies the presence of mixed polarities over scales comparable to _ hinode _ resolution , possibly producing asymmetric profiles like those in sot / sp observations .",
    "this is an important and easy check that has not been considered so far when analyzing stokes profiles produced from muram simulations .",
    "such a check is very important because many muram snapshots have been used to test inversion codes employed for extensive analyses of _ hinode _ data . as an example , in @xcite the authors considered three muram snapshots to test their me inversion code @xcite .",
    "the three snapshots were selected to be unipolar and with different values of the unsigned flux , namely , @xmath13  g , @xmath36  g , and @xmath59  g , so to take into account different magnetic regimes observable in the quiet sun . to reproduce _ hinode _ observations the finite spatial and spectral resolutions of sot / sp were considered through a degradation of the synthesized data .",
    "the @xmath4 polarimetric sensitivity was also taken into account to define the noise level of the synthesized observations . the strategy adopted by the authors",
    "can be regarded to be complete and rigorous , but at the same time a question is still open .",
    "are the profiles produced by the snapshots selected by @xcite an exhaustive set of profiles for the description of _ hinode _ measurements ?",
    "one could answer the question by comparing the synthetic profiles used by @xcite with those portrayed in fig .",
    "if they agree , then it would have two important consequences .",
    "first , the me code has been tested on a complete set of profiles which is representative of real observations so , as a direct consequence , the test guarantees that an analysis of sot / sp data performed through a me code is reliable .",
    "the second one is that muram snapshots are able to reproduce the physics producing _ hinode _ sot / sp measurements .",
    "we present the results of the ` k - means ` classification of _ hinode _ sot / sp stokes  @xmath0 profiles of  @xmath60  nm and  @xmath61  nm observed in the quiet sun .",
    "the classification procedure is automatic and unsupervised , and it is able to highlight the typical circular polarization measurements retrieved by sot / sp , and to organize them in classes . here",
    "we analyze the profiles from a @xmath1  arcsec@xmath2 portion of quiet photosphere .",
    "this dataset , consisting of @xmath24 profiles , can be regarded as a complete sample of polarization measurements performed at @xmath53  arcsec angular resolution and @xmath4 polarimetric sensitivity in the quiet sun .",
    "a large variety of profile shapes emerges from the quiet sun .",
    "these shapes can be typically classified in @xmath5 ` k - means ` classes ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . referring to the major features of the ` k - means ` classes",
    ", we were able to organize them in six families , namely , network , blue - lobe , red - lobe , @xmath8-like , asymmetric , and antisymmetric .",
    "asymmetric profiles are very common in the quiet sun , namely , about @xmath6  % of the analyzed quiet sun profiles .",
    "strongly asymmetric profiles are found in the in .",
    "they can be organized in three families : _ i ) _ blue - lobe , _ ii ) _ red - lobe , and _",
    "iii ) _ @xmath8-like profiles ( similarly to the definition in * ? ? ?",
    "these represent about @xmath7  % of the analyzed profiles .",
    "each family of profiles is associated to a certain photospheric dynamics as inferred from the line - core shift of the intensity profiles .",
    "blue - lobe profiles are in upflow regions , red - lobe ones are in downflows , and @xmath8-like profiles are in downflows ; these dynamical properties are probably related to certain magnetic configurations preferentially associated with granules or with intergranular lanes .    the classes associated to the network are found to be spatially coherent over tens of arcsec@xmath2 . in classes are found to be coherent over small scales ( i.e. , @xmath63  acrsec@xmath2 ) . from this we conclude that the processes producing strong asymmetries in stokes @xmath0 profiles take place over small scales , comparable to sot / sp angular resolution .",
    "we put forward a possible application of the set of ` k - means ` cluster profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "they contain all the stokes  @xmath0 shapes observed in the quiet sun at @xmath53  arcsec resolution and with maximum absolute amplitude larger than @xmath64 , therefore , they can be used as a standard reference to test inversion codes and to check the validity and completeness of modern mhd simulations .    from the abundance of asymmetric profiles",
    "we conclude that me inversions can not be considered to be exhaustive for the description of the properties of the quiet sun photosphere .",
    "indeed , stokes  @xmath0 profiles observed by _ hinode",
    "_ sot / sp in the quiet sun contain unique information about the stratification of the solar photosphere that so far have been overlooked in me analyses .",
    "the work of @xcite is the first attempt to try to extract this information .",
    "however , as shown in   [ disc ] , several alternative interpretations are possible through hypotheses on the underlying atmospheres .",
    "these alternatives should be sought to outline the spectrum of physical scenarios for the description of the quiet sun polarization measurements . those features common to all inversions",
    "will be regarded as robust results , whereas inconsistencies must be studied and cleared out .",
