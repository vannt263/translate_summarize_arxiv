    "the questions how different populations living in the same habitat interact with each other and with their surroundings are central to mathematical biology .    the competition for resources by two species ( in contrast to , e.g.",
    ", one being prey to the other ) is often modeled by means of lotka - volterra type competition terms , i.e. with coupling coefficients @xmath0 , @xmath1 in @xmath2 we refer to @xcite for conditions for global stability of fixed points in such systems : if @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for positive equilibria to be globally stable it is sufficient that they be locally stable .    of course",
    ", spatial homogeneity is a highly idealized situation , and dependence of the population size on a spatial variable together with the effects of random motion of individuals has been incorporated into the model ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 1.2 ) and references therein ) .",
    "one way of even simplest lifeforms to react to their environment is chemotaxis , that is the tendency to move in the direction of higher concentrations of a signal substance .",
    "inter alia , effects of chemotaxis on possible population size have been considered in @xcite .",
    "exploitation of chemotaxis for biotechnological purposes in mind and envisioning applications in e.g. agriculture ( like nitrogen fixation or denitrification ) , or in mammalian intestinal microbial ecology , in @xcite the authors compare species that undergo growth with different rates and diffusive versus diffusive plus chemotactic motion .",
    "they conclude : _ `` thus , chemotaxis can , when the response is sufficiently strong , overcome both disadvantages of inferior growth kinetics and random motility .",
    "[ ... ] at any rate , these results suggest that chemotactic responses might provide a useful means for controlling population dynamics in nonmixed systems .",
    "in particular , they provide a way to permit slowly growing populations to coexist with or outcompete faster growing species .",
    "such a situation might be highly desirable in many environmental or biotechnological applications . ''",
    "_ for the effectiveness of nutrient - taxis as advantageous dispersal strategy for populations in heterogeneous environments see e.g. @xcite .",
    "chemotaxis terms in combination with several populations also appear in the context of the host - parasite interaction modelled and analyzed in @xcite and @xcite , the food - chain model of @xcite , or the system in @xcite that deals with the spread of an epidemic disease .",
    "for one single species , chemotaxis is described by the celebrated model by keller and segel @xmath3 which has been treated intensively over the last decades .",
    "we refer to the surveys @xcite .    incorporating growth terms into this model , that is , adding @xmath4 to the first equation in ( studied in @xcite ) , gives rise to colorful dynamics as witnessed in e.g. @xcite , emphasized by attractor results in @xcite or illustrated by recent results on transient growth phenomena in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one of the most straightforward generalizations of this model to the situation of several species is to consider two species ( or two subpopulations of one species ) that react to the same signalling substance they both produce , as occurring in the differentiation of cell - types during slime mold formation in populations of _ dictyostelium discoideum _ , cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite .",
    "the pure two - species chemotaxis model without growth or competition effects has been introduced in @xcite and in particular blow - up of solutions in finite time , known to occur in the single - species situation , has been investigated also for the several species model ( see e.g. @xcite ) , both as to the question of occurrence of blow - up versus global existence ( see @xcite ) and of qualitative features of the former , for example whether it occurs simultaneously ( @xcite ) in both species , or nonsimultaneously ( @xcite ) ; for numerical observations pertaining to these models also confer @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the long term behaviour of globally existent solutions emanating from small initial data ( @xcite ) or for chemosensitivity functions capturing saturation effects ( @xcite ) has been investigated .",
    "a combination of the two mechanisms introduced so far ( lotka - volterra type competition and keller - segel type chemotaxis ) is examined in the two - species chemotaxis - competition model    @xmath5          v_t = d_2\\delta v - \\chi_2\\nabla \\cdot ( v\\nabla w )      + \\mu_2 v(1-a_2u - v ) ,       & x\\in\\omega,\\ t>0 ,    \\\\[1 mm ]           \\tau w_t = d_3\\delta w + \\alpha u + \\beta v - \\gamma w ,       & x\\in\\omega,\\ t>0 ,   \\\\[1 mm ]          \\nabla u\\cdot \\nu=\\nabla v\\cdot \\nu = \\nabla w\\cdot \\nu = 0 ,       & x\\in{\\partial}\\omega,\\ t>0 , \\\\[1 mm ]          u(x,0)=u_0(x),\\ ; v(x,0)=v_0(x),\\ ; w(x,0)=w_0(x ) ,       & x\\in\\omega ,    \\end{cases}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the population densities of two species undergoing chemotaxis in reaction to the signal having concentration @xmath8 , posed in a bounded smooth domain @xmath9 .",
    "herein , the diffusion rates of species and signal are given by @xmath10 , whereas @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) are used to denote the strengths of chemotaxis , growth kinetics and competition for each species , whereas the size of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 regulates the production of the signal by the first and second species and its decay , respectively .",
    "this model has first been considered in @xcite for @xmath16 , where it was shown for the weakly competitive case , i.e. @xmath17 that solutions to exist and converge to the coexistence steady state @xmath18 provided that @xmath19 result and proof of @xcite have successfully been extended to a setting of even more species in @xcite , the condition being analogous to .",
    "this condition seems quite unnatural , because it is not automatically satisfied in the absence of chemotaxis ( @xmath20 ) and it is the goal of the present paper to replace this condition by a smallness condition on @xmath21 , @xmath12 alone and to thus remove the additional condition on @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 implicitly posed by :    [ mainth ] let @xmath26 and @xmath27 be a bounded domain with smooth boundary .",
    "let @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath22 , @xmath23 fulfil and let @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 be such that @xmath33 , @xmath34 satisfy the conditions : @xmath35 then the following holds :    1 .   for all nonnegative functions @xmath36 , @xmath37 satisfying @xmath38 , @xmath39 , there exists a unique global - in - time classical solution @xmath40 of such that @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 in @xmath44 .",
    "the unique global solution @xmath45 of has the following asymptotic behaviour : @xmath46 uniformly in @xmath47 , where @xmath48    we want to emphasize that can indeed be viewed as a smallness condition on the relative chemotactic strength only and , in particular , satisfied in the chemotaxis - free case ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "+ the case of partially strong competition ( @xmath49 ) was considered in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that solutions exist globally and satisfy @xmath50 if @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 . in the fully parabolic system ( with @xmath54 ) , it was proven in @xcite that for sufficiently large values of @xmath24 , @xmath25 global classical solutions converge to the unique positive homogeneous equilibrium exponentially for @xmath49 ( and with an algebraic rate if @xmath55 and @xmath25 is large ) , and moreover that there are global bounded classical solutions for @xmath56 even if the parameters of the system are merely positive .",
    "furthermore , in spatially one - dimensional domains more insight into qualitative behaviour of the system has been obtained in @xcite and @xcite , where global existence of solutions was shown as well as existence of nonconstant steady states by bifurcation analysis .",
    "the stability of the bifurcating solutions is investigated there , too , and a time - periodic solution has been found .",
    "additionally , the findings have also been illustrated by numerical experiments ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) ) .    in @xcite , for different sensitivity functions satisfying @xmath57 for some @xmath58 , @xmath12 , global bounded classical solutions were proven to exist under the condition of @xmath59 being sufficiently small ( where the meaning of sufficiently small depends on the initial mass ) .",
    "in the competition - free case ( @xmath60 ) for sensitivity functions generalizing @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , global existence and boundedness of solutions were obtained , together with a result on asymptotic stability of steady states .",
    "( @xcite )    a system where the chemoattractant is not a signal substance produced by the population itself but a nutrient which is consumed , ( but which is otherwise similar ) , has been treated in @xcite .",
    "let us finally mention that also ( parabolic - elliptic ) keller - segel type systems of two species and two chemicals have been studied where the signal for each species is produced by the other ( @xcite ) .    a parabolic - parabolic - ode model with connections to chemotaxis - haptotaxis models",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) has been treated in @xcite .",
    "cross - diffusive effects like those added to the present system by means of the chemotaxis term pose a serious threat to any monotonicity properties one would like to employ and usually should render comparison arguments useless .",
    "nevertheless , in some situations closely related , comparison methods were employable , for example the proof of the result in @xcite relies on comparison with solutions to a system of four coupled odes .",
    "( in fact , a system closely related to was considered as example in @xcite , where comparison with solutions of ode systems has been developed more systematically . however , there the essential coupling arising from the appearance of @xmath6 and @xmath7 as source terms for the third equation was not included . )",
    "most successfully , comparison arguments were utilized in deriving the global asymptotic stability of in for the case of strong competition in @xcite .    the situation considered there is , in a certain sense , easier than the present case , since the limit of one component being @xmath63 makes lower estimates for this component unnecessary and simplifies the system of inequalities that has to be dealt with during the proof .",
    "nevertheless this method of eventual comparison , as we would like to call it , turns out to be a powerful tool also in the present context and we will use it to derive the desired result .",
    "more precisely , we shall proceed as follows : at first we will establish global existence and boundedness of the solutions to . then , knowing that limes inferior and limes superior of each component exist and are not infinite , we find differential inequalities that are eventually ( that is , on time intervals of the form @xmath64 for some @xmath65 ) satisfied and that are accessible to comparison arguments , the corresponding ode solution converging ( almost ) regardless of its initial value .",
    "this will give us enough information to deduce the precise value of limites superior and inferior and to prove convergence of the solution to the coexistence steady state .",
