    "until 2001 only three candidates existed for @xmath0 hypernuclei observed in emulsion experiments @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 binding energies deduced from these emulsion events indicated that the @xmath0 interaction is strongly attractive in the @xmath6 channel @xcite , with a @xmath0 pairing energy @xmath7 mev , although it had been realized @xcite that the binding energies of @xmath8be @xcite and @xmath2he @xcite are inconsistent with each other .",
    "this outlook has undergone an important change following the very recent report by the kek hybrid - emulsion experiment e373 of a well - established new candidate @xcite for @xmath2he , with binding energy ( @xmath9 mev ) substantially lower than that deduced from the older , dubious event @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there are also indications from the ags experiment e906 for the production of light @xmath0 hypernuclei @xcite , perhaps as light even as @xmath10h , in the @xmath11 reaction on @xmath12be .",
    "since data on hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath13 ) and hyperon - hyperon ( @xmath14 ) interactions are scarce or even not readily available from laboratory experiments , the study of multistrange systems provides a fairly exclusive test of microscopic models for the baryon - baryon ( @xmath15 ) interaction .",
    "the nijmegen group has constructed over the years a number of one - boson - exchange ( obe ) models ( reviewed by rijken in ref.@xcite and in these proceedings ) for the @xmath15 interaction using su(3)-flavor symmetry to relate coupling constants and phenomenological short - distance hard or soft cores . in all of these rather different @xmath15 interaction models",
    "only 35 @xmath13 low - energy , generally imprecise data points serve the purpose of steering phenomenologically the extrapolation from the @xmath16 sector , which relies on thousands of data points , into the strange @xmath13 and @xmath14 sectors .",
    "it is therefore of utmost importance to confront these models with the new @xmath0 hypernuclear data in order to provide meaningful constraints on the extrapolation to strangeness @xmath17 and beyond .",
    "the @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath18-wave interaction input potentials to the structure calculations here reviewed often consist of combinations of gaussians with different ranges , such as to make these single - channel potentials phase equivalent to the nijmegen obe - model coupled - channel potentials .",
    "of the several @xmath0 potentials due to nijmegen models which are shown in fig.[fig : llpot ] , nsc97e is the weakest one , of the order of magnitude required to reproduce @xmath19he ) .",
    "the @xmath0 interaction is fairly weak for all six versions ( @xmath20)-(@xmath21 ) of the nijmegen soft - core model nsc97 @xcite , and versions @xmath22 and @xmath21 provide a reasonable description of single-@xmath23 hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "in this section i will review topical theoretical work on some of the light @xmath0 hypernuclear species connected to old and to new experiments .",
    "the anticipated existence of @xmath2he , now solidly established also experimentally @xcite , leads one to enquire where the onset of @xmath0 binding occurs .",

    "@xmath36 increases monotonically with the strength of @xmath37 , starting in approximately zero as @xmath38 , which is a general feature of three - body models such as the @xmath39 , @xmath40h@xmath0 and @xmath40he@xmath0 models used in these @xmath18-wave faddeev calculations @xcite , and also as shown below for @xmath41 @xmath18-wave faddeev calculations @xcite .",

    "i start by discussing the first faddeev - yakubovsky ( fy ) four - body calculation of @xmath44h @xcite . for two identical hyperons and two essentially identical nucleons ( upon introducing isospin ) as appropriate to a @xmath45 model calculation of @xmath44h , the 18 fy components reduce to seven independent components satisfying coupled equations .",

    "it is questionable whether by incorporating higher partial waves , or @xmath67 coupling effects , this qualitative feature will change .",
    "the above conclusions have been very recently challenged by nemura et al.@xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : akaishi ] demonstrates that within their stochastic variational calculation , which uses the nsc97f input of the filikhin and gal calculation @xcite for the various pairwise interactions , a ` @xmath68 ' model _ always _ yields more binding than a ` @xmath41 ' model does .",

    "argue that the @xmath56 interaction in the @xmath69 channel , when adjusted to the binding energy calculated for the @xmath1 @xmath23 hypernuclei , should be taken weaker than that used by filikhin and gal and that , when this constraint is implemented ( ` set a ' in the figure ) , particle stability for @xmath44h(@xmath62 ) requires a minimum strength for @xmath37 which is not satisfied by the choice of @xmath53he ) as a normalizing datum .",
    "a similar strong dependence on the @xmath69 @xmath56 interaction within a @xmath61 model is shown in fig.[fig : exp ] for two versions @xmath21 and @xmath70 of model nsc97 which produce the same @xmath71 , while differing slightly by the location of the spin - flip @xmath72 excited state @xcite .      for heavier @xmath0 hypernuclei ,",
    "the relationship between the three - body and four - body models is opposite to that found by filikhin and gal for @xmath44h : the @xmath74 calculation provides _ higher _ binding than a properly defined @xmath75 calculation yields ( with @xmath76 ) due to the attraction induced by the @xmath77-@xmath78 , @xmath79-@xmath80 , @xmath81-@xmath82 four - body rearrangement channels that include bound states for which there is no room in the three - body @xmath75 model .",

    "this apparent discrepancy may be substantially reduced by accepting a @xmath73be weak decay scheme that involves the 3 mev excited @xmath93be doublet rather than the @xmath93be ground state @xcite .",
    "this conclusion may also be inferred from the recent 4-body calculations by hiyama et al . for @xmath94 @xmath0 hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "since model nsc97 @xcite provides a qualitatively successful extrapolation from fits to @xmath16 and @xmath13 data to @xmath95 , and noting the strongly attractive @xmath96 @xmath97 potentials shown in fig .",

    "bodmer @xcite , and more specifically witten @xcite , suggested that strange quark matter , with roughly equal composition of @xmath108 , @xmath66 and @xmath18 quarks , might provide the absolutely stable form of matter .",
    "metastable strange quark matter has been studied by chin and kerman @xcite .",
    "jaffe and collaborators @xcite subsequently charted the various scenarios possible for the stability of strange quark matter , from absolute stability down to metastability due to weak decays .",
    "finite strange quark systems , so called strangelets , have also been considered @xcite .",
    "less advertised , perhaps , is the observation made by schaffner et al .",
    "that metastable strange systems with similar properties , i.e. a strangeness fraction @xmath109 and a charge fraction @xmath110 , might also exist in the hadronic basis at moderate values of density , between twice and three times nuclear matter density @xcite .",
    "these strange systems are made out of @xmath54 , @xmath23 and @xmath4 baryons .",
    "the metastability of these strange hadronic systems was established by extending relativistic mean field ( rmf ) calculations from ordinary nuclei ( @xmath111 ) to multi - strange nuclei with @xmath112 .",
    "although the detailed pattern of metastability , as well as the actual values of the binding energy , depend specifically on the partly unknown hyperon potentials assumed in dense matter , the predicted phenomenon of metastability turned out to be robust in these calculations @xcite .",
    "recently , model nsc97 and its extension @xcite were used to calculate within the rmf framework the minimum - energy equilibrium composition of bulk strange hadronic matter ( shm ) made out of the su(3 ) octet baryons @xmath113 and @xmath4 , over the entire range of strangeness fraction @xmath114 @xcite .",

    "as is shown below , a first - order phase transition occurs from @xmath125 dominated matter for @xmath117 to @xmath126 dominated matter for @xmath123 , with binding energies per baryon reaching as much as 80 mev .    a phase transition is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : sbg4 ] where the binding energy is drawn versus the baryon density for several representative fixed values of @xmath127 . for @xmath128 , there is a global minimum at a baryon density of @xmath129 @xmath130 . a shallow local minimum",

    "is amplified and the relationship between the two minima is reversed , as the minimum at higher baryon density becomes energetically favored .",
    "the system will then undergo a transition from the low density state to the high density state .",
