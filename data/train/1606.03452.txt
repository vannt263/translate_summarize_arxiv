    "significant efforts have focused on determining the sources responsible for cosmic reionization .",
    "studies suggesting the apparent minor role of quasars in keeping the universe ionized at @xmath8 ( e.g. , @xcite  but see @xcite ) have led the community to assess the contribution of star - forming galaxies to the ionizing photon budget at high redshift ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these investigations have advocated broadly for the important role of hitherto undetected uv - faint galaxies  with their high number densities as inferred from the steep faint - end slopes of the uv luminosity functions and their assumed large lyman continuum ( lyc ) escape fractions  in dominating the ionizing background .",
    "however , the direct detection of lyman continuum radiation , possible only at modest redshifts ( @xmath9 ) where the transmissivity of the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) allows such measurements , remains elusive .",
    "locally , only a handful of objects have been detected with lyc emission @xcite .",
    "there are a number of statistical detections in stacked spectra @xcite and individual detections of candidate lyc emission from both lbgs and ly@xmath6-selected samples @xcite at @xmath8 .",
    "however , foreground contamination has been identified as a significant issue in interpreting the lyc emission from high - redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , at face value , lyc detections at @xmath10 , combined with upper limits on the escape fraction locally and at intermediate redshifts @xcite , have motivated an interpretation where the lyc escape fraction  i.e . , the fraction of h - ionizing photons that escapes galaxies before being attenuated by either the igm or the circum - galactic medium(cgm)evolves towards larger values at higher redshift @xcite",
    ".    analyses of the limited number of lyc detections , as well as observations of the ly@xmath6 escape fractions in high - redshift galaxies , suggest that dust reddening and/or gas covering fraction play an important role in modulating the escape of lyc ( and ly@xmath6 ) photons ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "rest - frame uv spectroscopic studies of high - redshift galaxies have focused on the propensity of ly@xmath6/lyc escape based on an examination of the gas covering fraction as typically inferred from saturated low - ionization interstellar ( is ) absorption lines ( e.g. , , , ) that are relatively straightforward to measure ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , these transitions may arise in gas of much higher optical depth ",
    "e.g . , if the ions are co - spatial with the densest gas  than that required to significantly attenuate lyc photons ( @xmath11\\approx 18 $ ] ) , leading to some ambiguity in the @xmath5 covering fraction .",
    "obviously , one should directly measure the column density and covering fraction of @xmath5 where the ly@xmath6/lyc opacity originates .",
    "the difficulty with this approach , until recently , has been that : ( a ) the detection of the @xmath5 absorption lines requires deep far - uv spectroscopy with blue - sensitive spectrographs , and ( b ) the proper interpretation of these lines requires careful corrections for differential atmospheric refraction relevant at the observed wavelengths , as well as large samples to average over variations in ly@xmath6 forest blanketing .",
    "moreover , apart from the anecdotal evidence of a connection between ionizing escape fraction , _ neutral _ gas covering fraction , and reddening , a quantitative study of how these properties are related to each other has yet to be undertaken .    to that end",
    ", we have used a sample of @xmath0 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) to place constraints on the two mechanisms that act to suppress the escape of ionizing photons : photoelectric absorption by neutral hydrogen ( @xmath5 ) and dust obscuration . in reddy",
    "( 2016a ) , subsequently referred to as paper  i , we use our sample of @xmath0 lbgs to deduce the shape of the dust attenuation curve to wavelengths close to the lyman break .",
    "the resulting curve rises less steeply towards bluer wavelengths than other commonly adopted attenuation curves ( e.g. , @xcite ) , implying a factor of @xmath12 lower dust attenuation of lyc photons for typical ( @xmath13 ) galaxies at @xmath0 . in this paper , we extend these results by modeling the composite ( stacked ) uv spectra of @xmath0 galaxies to assess the neutral gas column densities and covering fractions relevant for typical star - forming galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "we then draw a connection between reddening , gas covering fraction , and ionizing escape fraction .",

    "we determined the extent to which uncertainties in the redshifts and the resolution of the individual galaxy spectra lead to non - zero fluxes in the @xmath5 line cores in the stacked spectrum . to accomplish this",

    "this velocity spread is based on the uncertainties in the systemic redshifts when they are derived using interstellar absorption lines ( see @xcite ) , and the vast majority of the lyc spectra have systemic redshifts based on the latter .",
    "these 121 versions were then averaged together to produce a composite model . based on these simulations",

    "for the actual value of the resolution of our spectra and our typical redshift uncertainty , the cores of the @xmath5 lines remain black , implying that none of the observed residual flux density can be attributed to spectral resolution or redshift uncertainties .",
    "we conclude that systematic uncertainties in spectral resolution can not account for the residual line flux density at the @xmath5 line cores .",
    "we ruled out foreground contamination ",
    ", low - redshift objects that are unresolved from the lbgs in the ground - based photometry and spectroscopy  as a possible origin for the residual line flux observed at the @xmath5 line cores based on multiple lines of reasoning .",
    "first , we examined the contamination statistics for the sample of lbgs with spatially - resolved _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) multi - filter ( @xmath75 ) and ground - based nb3420 imaging ( to target lyc emission at @xmath0 ) analyzed in @xcite .",
    "their sample contains 16 lbgs with _",
    "hst _ imaging , four of which have nb3420 detections .",
    "of these four , two were identified as having foreground contaminants , such that the offending low - redshift interlopers would not have been resolved separately from the background lbgs in the ground - based photometry . of the 12 objects that were not detected in the nb3420 imaging ,",
    "only one suffers from foreground contamination .",
    "thus , the contamination rates for nb3420 detections and non - detections are @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively . extrapolating to the full lbg sample of @xcite , where five of 49 objects were detected in the narrow - band imaging",
    ", implies that the fraction of lbgs with contaminated photometry is @xmath78 .",
    "note that what we have just computed is the foreground contamination _",
    "rate_. however , the quantity of relevance in the present context is not the contamination rate , but the actual fraction of _ flux _ contributed by foreground contaminants .    to calculate this flux contamination , we examined the photometry for the 16 lbgs with _ hst _ imaging from @xcite .",
    "we summed the @xmath75 flux densities for the 16 objects , both including and excluding foreground contaminants that would have been unresolved from the lbgs in the ground - based imaging .",
    "the ratio of the total flux in each band including foreground contamination to that excluding this contamination is @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath80 , respectively , for the @xmath75 bands .",
    "accounting for the higher foreground contamination rate among the 16 lbgs ( @xmath82 ) relative to the rate among the full lbg sample ( @xmath83 , see above ) , and adopting the reasonable assumption that the flux contamination per object is roughly constant , the aforementioned ratios become @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath80 , and @xmath85 , respectively , for the @xmath75 bands .",
    "in other words , the flux contamination fraction for the rest - frame non - ionizing uv / optical flux is @xmath86 .",
    "the flux contamination fraction in the @xmath87-band is substantially larger , a point that we revisit in section  [ sec : escape ] .",
    "based on these statistics , the contaminating flux density across the wavelength range spanning the ly@xmath56 , ly@xmath57 , and ly@xmath61 lines is a factor of @xmath88 lower than the residual flux densities measured at the aforementioned line centers .",
    "note that the previously discussed contamination rates were calculated for lbgs that were spectroscopically confirmed using relatively shallow spectroscopic data @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic blends may not be as readily identifiable in these shallow spectra compared to the substantially deeper lyc spectra analyzed here .",
    "as indicated in section  [ sec : sample ] , the @xmath25hrs spectroscopic integrations obtained with lris - b allowed us to remove a handful ( @xmath63 ) of lbgs that were confused with foreground interlopers .",
    "in fact , this contaminating rate is consistent with the expected number of chance superpositions of foreground objects , as discussed in steidel et  al .",
    "( in prep ) , implying that the present sample has been expunged of most contaminants .",
    "thus , the contamination rates calculated above should be regarded as conservative upper limits .",
    "there is additional evidence that suggests that the residual line flux at the @xmath5 line centers is intrinsic to the lbgs .",
    "namely , in the subsequent analysis , we show that this residual flux varies systematically with @xmath1 such that redder galaxies exhibit lower levels of residual emission ( section  [ sec : specfitting ] ) , a trend that would not be expected if foreground interlopers were dominating the observed flux .",
    "for example , of the three lbgs identified with foreground contamination from the sample of @xcite , two have interlopers that result in slightly _ redder _ colors compared to the corrected photometry , and one has an interloper that results in a color that is indistinguishable from the corrected color .",
    "notwithstanding the small statistics , it follows that an increase in contamination fraction for galaxies with redder @xmath1 should lead to a corresponding _ increase _ in residual flux , a trend that is opposite to the one actually observed ( section  [ sec : specfitting ] ) .      to summarize our arguments",
    ", we find that systematic uncertainties in the resolution of our spectra , combined with random uncertainties in systemic redshifts , can not explain the level of residual flux seen in the stacked spectra .",
    "furthermore , calculations of the flux contamination fraction for the sample of lbgs examined in @xcite imply that @xmath89 of the residual flux must be intrinsic to the lbgs and not a result of foreground interlopers .",
    "if the statistics of how the colors of lbgs are altered due to foreground interlopers extend to larger samples , then significant contamination would be expected to lead to a higher residual flux for redder galaxies , contrary to the trend that we observe , as discussed in section  [ sec : specfitting ] .",
    "we conclude with some words of caution regarding the covering fractions derived here .",
    "first , while the composite may indicate @xmath90 , low resolution spectroscopy may mask the presence of very narrow absorption components that are opaque to lyc radiation . however , if the presence of such narrow ( and black ) components were the rule , rather than the exception , for galaxies in our sample , we would expect little correlation between the covering fraction derived from low resolution spectra and the ly@xmath6 escape fraction , counter to our observations ( sections  [ sec : specfitting ] and [ sec : lines ] ) .",
    "second , the method for computing @xmath2 assumes that the different velocity components of the @xmath5 gas are spatially co - incident when viewed in projection . if this is not the case ",
    ", if optically - thick gas that absorbs far from line center covers sightlines that are disjoint from those where the absorption at line center dominates  then @xmath2 deduced based on the overall depth of the @xmath5 absorption will underestimate the true @xmath5 covering fraction . as we show in section  [ sec : escape ] , the two effects just mentioned ( i.e. , unresolved narrow absorption and spatially disjoint gas at different velocities ) must be limited in scope .",
    "even so , in light of this discussion , one must consider that the covering fractions derived in our subsequent analysis may be lower limits to the true fractions .    to demonstrate the requirement of a non - unity covering fraction , we modeled the composite spectrum of all galaxies in our sample ( figure  [ fig : fcov_compall ] ) using the same procedure as above in fitting @xmath1 and @xmath5 ( we ignored @xmath34 for this exercise ) , but where we now assumed a unity covering fraction of both dust and gas .",
    "the depth of the ly@xmath56 line can be reproduced with @xmath68}=15.9 $ ] , but such a low column density does not match the combined red damping wing of ly@xmath6 and p - cygni absorption , nor the depths of the higher lyman series lines ( figure  [ fig : covfracexample ] ) . alternatively , the assumption of @xmath68}=21.0 $ ] gas reproduces the combined red damping wing of ly@xmath6 and p - cygni absorption , but implies optically - thick gas and hence saturated @xmath5 lines that should reach zero intensity at the line cores for a unity covering fraction .",
    "thus , it is clear that neither low or high column density gas with complete covering can simultaneously reproduce the residual flux at the @xmath5 line centers and the damping wings of ly@xmath6 .",
    "rather , the roughly equal depths of the lyman series lines combined with the damping wings of ly@xmath6 suggest optically thick gas with @xmath68}\\ga 21.0 $ ] and @xmath90 . consequently , the depths of the @xmath5 lines and the red damping wing of ly@xmath6 are most sensitive to changes in the covering fraction of optically thick @xmath5 .      from a physical standpoint ,",
    "a partial covering of dust and gas can result from supernovae chimneys or galactic fountains , whereby supernovae explosions heat the ism and drive hot gas into the galactic halo ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . aside from direct observations of such hot halos in the milky way and other nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the higher star - formation - rate surface densities of , and the ubiquitous presence of outflows in , high - redshift galaxies may increase the porosity of the ism .",
    "furthermore , simulations of high - redshift galaxies show that the lyc escape fraction is essentially independent of dust obscuration , with the ionizing photons escaping the galaxies through channels that are essentially free of dust @xcite , as depicted in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] . in this cartoon picture ,",
    "the column of gas is sufficient to completely bound the ionized region by neutral gas , where the bulk of the neutral and ionized gas along the line - of - sight are entrained in an outflow ( see also figure  1 in @xcite ) .",
    "using the procedure laid out in section  [ sec : methodology ] , we fit a spectral model to the composite of all galaxies ( full composite ) , assuming a non - unity covering fraction of dust and gas , and an smc extinction curve .",
    "the model was obtained by simultaneously varying @xmath91 , @xmath2 , @xmath41 , @xmath53 , and @xmath51 , until a best - fit was reached .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath92 , @xmath67=21.0 $ ] , @xmath93 , @xmath94=20.9 $ ] , and @xmath95 . by perturbing the composite spectrum by its errors and refitting these realizations",

    "however , as @xmath2 is determined primarily by the depth of the @xmath5 lines , and @xmath41 is constrained primarily by the wings , there is negligible covariance between the covering fraction and column density of @xmath5 .",

    "given the prevalent use of low - ionization interstellar absorption lines as proxies for the neutral gas covering fraction in high - redshift galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it is instructive to directly compare the covering fractions deduced from the low - ionization lines with those computed from the depth of the @xmath5 lines . to accomplish this ,",

    "the dispersion in the absorption line depths yielded the measurement uncertainty in @xmath191 , but of course does not include systematic errors associated with the specific model for the continuum level .    the covering fractions of the low - ionization species are correlated with , but are systematically lower than , those derived from the @xmath5 lines ( lower right panel of figure  [ fig : lowions ] ) .",
    "there are several possible explanations for why the low - ionization lines suggest lower covering fractions .",
    "first , if most of the metals inhabit narrow and unresolved absorption systems , then the depth of the metal lines will underpredict the covering fraction . likewise ,",
    "if the metal - enriched gas has a substantial velocity gradient across the face of the galaxy , then the derived covering fractions may be lower limits ( e.g. , see discussion in section  [ sec : evidencefornonunity ] ) . while we can not definitively rule out either of these possibilities , the similarity in the blueshift ( @xmath192kms@xmath15 ) and velocity spread ( fwhm@xmath193kms@xmath15 ; e.g. , compare figure  [ fig : lowions ] to the right panel of figure  [",
    "fig : subtract ] ) of the low - ionization and @xmath5 lines suggests that the two components are kinematically coupled , where the former covers a smaller portion of the galaxy s continuum . such a configuration may arise if dense and metal - enriched pockets of gas are embedded within the outflowing @xmath5 .",

    "notwithstanding the fact that the line - of - sight reddening will be sensitive to the total column of dust ( including that of the ionized gas ) , an increase in the dust - to - gas ratio of the outflowing gas for objects with redder continuum would result in a strong correlation between @xmath55 and @xmath1 , consistent with what we actually observe ( left panel of figure  [ fig : covfrac ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : highions ] shows the profiles of the two @xmath196 transitions for each bin of reddening . as the ionization potential for ( @xmath197ev ) is much higher than that required for h - ionization , the associated transitions arise from h - ionized gas .",

    "do not correlate obviously with the reddening of the continuum , we surmise that the outflowing ionized gas has an optical depth @xmath200 .",
    "note that the errors in @xmath201 do not rule the possibility of the lines being saturated , in which case the covering fraction of the ionized material is @xmath202 .",
    "more generally , the presence of these high - ionization is absorption lines suggests an ionized medium mixed with metals and dust .      to summarize , we find that the absolute escape fraction of ly@xmath6 photons , @xmath177 , inversely correlates with @xmath2 , suggesting that the neutral gas covering fraction plays a significant role in modulating the escape of ly@xmath6 photons .",
    "the low - ionization interstellar doublet @xmath203 is saturated , exhibits similar absorption depths and velocity profiles to those of other low - ionization is absorption lines , and suggests a covering fraction of low - ionization material , @xmath191 , that increases with continuum reddening ( and @xmath2 ) from @xmath204 for the bluest galaxies in our sample to @xmath205 for the reddest ones .",
    "however , @xmath191 is systematically lower than @xmath2 , while the low - ionization lines have similar blueshifts and velocity profiles as the @xmath5 lines , suggesting that galaxy outflows consist in part of a neutral medium embedded with clumps of metal - enriched gas .",

    ", our new measurement of the far - uv shape of the dust curve at high redshift , presented in paper  i , implies a lower attenuation of lyc photons than those inferred from simple extrapolations of the @xcite and @xcite attenuation curves .",
    "alternatively , the high column densities ( @xmath68}\\ga 20.3 $ ] ) inferred from the fitting presented in section  [ sec : specfitting ] suggest that the covered portions of a galaxy are optically thick to lyc radiation , with implied optical depths at @xmath206 of @xmath207 . thus , for the average galaxy , photoelectric absorption , rather than dust , dominates the depletion of lyc photons .",

    "we calculated an `` extrapolated '' model which assumes that the neutral gas is optically - thick to ionizing photons at all values of @xmath1 , and that the uncovered portions of the galaxies are effectively free of dust and gas . in this case , the model is given simply by equation  [ eq : final2 ] . in the `` fiducial '' model",

    "the fiducial model deviates from the other two at @xmath256 where the neutral gas becomes optically thin ( @xmath257@xmath163 ) , thus allowing the escape of additional lyc photons above the expectations from the extrapolated model ( i.e. , the covered portion of the galaxies continua , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] , becomes optically thin ) .",
    "for very blue @xmath1 , @xmath258 and the observed lyc - to - uv flux density ratio simply converges to the intrinsic value modulated by the combined igm and cgm opacities . for very red @xmath1 ,",
    "the ratio of the observed and intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratios increases to values larger than unity .",
    "this can be explained as follows .",
    "lyc photons escape the galaxies only through clear sightlines , and the modeling assumes that the dust attenuation of such photons in negligible along these sightlines .",
    "thus , the only way in which the observed lyc flux density depends on the reddening is through the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath1 . the absolute escape fraction of lyc photons , i.e. , @xmath54 , does not decrease as rapidly as the absolute escape fraction of non - ionizing uv photons  as the covering fraction asymptotes to unity for @xmath259resulting in a steep rise of the model prediction of @xmath260/[s(900)_{\\rm      int}/s(1500)_{\\rm int}]$ ] for @xmath261 .",
    "there is negligible variation in the model curve shapes at @xmath262 for different assumptions of the stellar attenuation curve .",
    "thus , in practice , one can simply assume a single model that is invariant to assumptions of the adopted attenuation curve .",
    "on the other hand , the offset in the relation between @xmath2 and @xmath1 that arises from different assumptions of the line - of - sight extinction curve ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : covfrac ] ) results in a factor of up to @xmath195 difference in the predicted @xmath263 at a given @xmath1 for @xmath264 . this systematic difference may be partly attributed to the lack of data for galaxies bluer than @xmath265 with which to constrain the fit between @xmath2 and @xmath1 . in the following ,",
    "we discuss how these model curves may be used to evaluate the possible mechanisms of lyc escape and/or constrain the intrinsic ionizing spectrum of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we preface our discussion by noting that deep far - uv spectra of the kind used for our study would be useful to obtain over a broader dynamic range of @xmath1 , in particular focusing on the bluer galaxies that are more analogous to typical galaxies at @xmath266 and which may have larger ionizing escape fractions .",
    "far - uv spectra may be used to directly measure the covering fraction of neutral gas at @xmath267 using the technique described in section  [ sec : specfitting ] , and will enable more accurate estimates of the column densities and line - of - sight reddening for such galaxies .",
    "nonetheless , in the following , we illustrate how such a model may be used to discern the mechanisms by which lyc photons escape from high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the most direct application of our model is that it can be used to predict the average relative escape fraction of ionizing photons for a given stellar population model .",
    "for example , if we assume @xmath268 , a value typical of that adopted in previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , then a sample of galaxies at @xmath269 with @xmath270 would be predicted to have an observed relative escape fraction of @xmath271 .",
    "the relative escape fraction corrected for attenuation by the igm and cgm is @xmath272 , and the absolute escape fraction is @xmath63 .",
    "we emphasize that the model should only be applied to an ensemble of galaxies where the stellar populations and different configurations of the gas and stars from galaxy - to - galaxy , and the stochasticity in the ly@xmath6 forest along different sightlines , can be averaged out .",
    "a second and potentially powerful application of our model is immediately obvious .",
    "namely , with direct measurements of the average observed lyc - to - uv flux density ratio for an ensemble of galaxies with some average continuum reddening , @xmath273 , one may invert equation  [ eq : final2 ] to calculate @xmath274 . the importance of direct empirical constraints on the intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratio is underscored by the fact that the different flavors of stellar population models ( e.g. , arising from different ages and metallicities for a given star - formation history , and/or the treatment of stellar rotation / binarity ; @xcite ) predict a factor of @xmath88 variation in the intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratios of @xmath275 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the actual range in the predictions of the stellar population models are larger than a factor of @xmath88 if we also consider variations in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) and star - formation history .",
    "clearly , independent information from the rest - frame uv continuum spectra , rest - frame optical nebular emission line spectra , and/or stellar population modeling may be used to narrow the range of possible @xmath276 @xcite . nevertheless , there is substantial utility in directly constraining the intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratio without having to extrapolate the spectra of massive stars to wavelengths blueward of what is typically accessible from observations .    to demonstrate how our model can be used to constrain the intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratio , we considered the recent measurement of the relative escape fraction of galaxies in our sample by steidel et  al .",

    "the magnitude of the bias in @xmath274 that stems from these effects is @xmath287 and @xmath288 , respectively .",
    "additional systematic uncertainty may arise from the choice of igm prescription .",

    "the _ combined _",
    "igm+cgm opacity predicted by @xcite is @xmath290 .",
    "this suggests a systematic uncertainty associated with the igm prescription of @xmath291 .",
    "the largest source of systematic uncertainty relates to our inability to fully resolve the @xmath5 absorption .",
    "specifically , our estimate of @xmath2 may be a lower limit as a result of several effects , some of which are discussed in section  [ sec : evidencefornonunity ] .",
    "first , the relatively low spectral resolution of our data may mask the presence of narrow absorption line systems with a higher covering fraction than that deduced from the spectra .",
    "second , if the different velocity components of the optically - thick @xmath5 are not covering the same lines - of - sight , then the integrated covering fraction may be larger than the value found for the bulk of the absorbing gas .",
    "third , we are unable to discern whether non - negligible columns of @xmath5 and dust exist in regions that we would otherwise refer to as `` clear '' sightlines .",
    "fourth , the ionized gas may not be completely bounded by @xmath5 ( i.e. , the `` average '' configuration of the @xmath5 and may be intermediate between the radiation- and density - bounded scenarios ) . in this latter case ,",
    "attenuation by dust in the ionized gas may deplete lyc photons before they escape the galaxy .",
    "for these reasons , the _ effective _ covering fraction , @xmath292 , may be larger than the value derived from the composite spectrum and hence the calculated value of @xmath274 may be a lower limit .    to further evaluate the range of possible @xmath274 allowed by the data , we compared our estimate with the predictions of several stellar population synthesis models ( figure  [ fig : stelpop ] ) .",
    "we considered @xcite @xmath293@xmath294 and @xmath294 models with a @xcite imf ( power law index of @xmath295 ) over the mass range @xmath296@xmath297 ; and the most recent version of the starburst99 ( s99 ) models which adopt weaker stellar winds relative to the the previous version @xcite .",
    "we generated s99 models using the @xcite imf with different power law slopes of @xmath298 , @xmath299 , and @xmath300 , over the mass range @xmath301@xmath297 , and with a metallicity of @xmath302@xmath294 .",
    "lastly , we consider the `` binary population and spectral synthesis '' ( bpass ; @xcite ) models that include binary evolution , with a power law slope of the imf of @xmath303 over the mass range @xmath304@xmath297 , with metallicities of @xmath152 and @xmath302@xmath294 .",
    "all metallicities assume the solar abundances measured in @xcite .    the effect of binary evolution ( as in the bpass models ) is to allow efficient mass transfer from a massive star to its ( secondary ) companion , causing the latter to spin up quickly and , for a low stellar metallicity where the stellar wind is sufficiently weak , retain its angular momentum @xcite .",
    "consequently , the secondary becomes fully mixed and undergoes quasi - homogeneous evolution @xcite whereby the main sequence lifetime and effective temperature are increased . in such models ,",
    "the ionizing photon flux per non - ionizing uv photon flux may increase by up to @xmath305 relative to single star evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",

    "figure  [ fig : stelpop ] shows the limit on @xmath274 based on @xmath306 derived from the composite spectrum of all 933 galaxies in our sample .",
    "our inference of the gas covering fraction favors an intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratio that is larger than the value predicted from the @xcite stellar population models , and one that is consistent with those obtained with the newer versions of the s99 models that adopt weaker massive star stellar winds , a low stellar metallicity , and/or a flatter slope of the imf ; or those models that include the effects of binary evolution . for the reasons stated above",
    ", the covering fractions derived here are likely lower limits , and therefore it is instructive to gauge the degree to which the covering fraction may be higher and still be consistent with the predictions of stellar population synthesis models .    in particular , if the effective covering fraction is @xmath307 or @xmath308 , instead of @xmath117 , then the inferred @xmath278 increases from @xmath309 to @xmath310 and @xmath311 , respectively .",
    "note that the latter is @xmath312 larger than the value predicted by the low - metallicity bpass models and/or the low - metallicity and shallow-@xmath6 imf s99 models .",
    "thus it is apparent , though ironic , that it is those galaxies with the largest covering fractions ( as is the case for the average galaxy at @xmath0 ) which provide the most sensitive constraints on the intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratio , since even small increases in @xmath2 will lead to very large changes in the inferred @xmath278 ( figure  [ fig : stelpop ] ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that stellar population models that include the effects of binary evolution are required to simultaneously reproduce the rest - frame far - uv continuum , stellar , and nebular features , and the rest - frame optical nebular emission line strengths measured for galaxies at @xmath313 .",
    "if we adopt such models as the most appropriate , then it implies that our estimate of @xmath96 for typical galaxies at @xmath0 is not biased low by more than @xmath137 .",
    "stated another way , the combined effects of additional @xmath5 absorption and dust attenuation can not deplete more than @xmath314 of the photons exiting through what we would otherwise refer to as `` clear '' sightlines based on the depths of the @xmath5 lines in the composite spectra .",
    "_ this analysis underscores the fact that if the simple geometry of figure  [ fig : cartoon ] is valid on average for an ensemble of galaxies , then deep uv spectroscopy for large samples of typical star - forming galaxies at high redshift should enable tight constraints on the intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratio . _",
    "hence , our framework provides an alternative and powerful independent method of constraining the intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratio , which is currently one of the most uncertain parameters entering into the calculation of the absolute escape fraction of ionizing photons in high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the geometry depicted in figure  [ fig : cartoon ] may not apply for all galaxies , and in reality more complicated configurations of the dust , gas , and stars may be expected . in this context , the model described here provides a useful benchmark to investigate changes in geometry and hence alternate pathways for the escape of ionizing radiation . to illustrate this , we show in figure  [ fig : devgeo ] @xmath315 as a function of @xmath1 assuming the fiducial model for the smc extinction curve .",
    "we have assumed @xmath316 , a value typical of the bpass models and the s99 models with a flat imf slope , and igm and cgm opacities relevant for galaxies at z=3.05 .",
    "direct measurements of @xmath315 and @xmath273 for an _ ensemble _ of galaxies may be used to ascertain the mechanisms by which lyc photons escape galaxies .",
    "for example , if these average values lie in the _ green _ region , then it suggests that , at least on average , those galaxies have either a smaller intrinsic 900-to-1500 flux density ratio than the one we have adopted here , or that the `` uncovered '' portions of the continuum are not completely free of dust and/or gas .",
    "similarly , objects whose average values place them in the _ purple _ region are ones that may have a larger intrinsic 900-to-1500 flux density ratio or optically - thin neutral gas that allows the escape of additional lyc photons .",
    "finally , galaxies whose average values lie in the _ cyan _ region _ must _ have a larger intrinsic 900-to-1500 flux density ratio on average than the one assumed here .",
    "further discrimination of the mechanisms by which lyc photons escape galaxies , or of the value of the intrinsic lyc - to - uv flux density ratio , can be accomplished with deep spectroscopy , such as that presented here . from this spectroscopy",
    ", we have found that typical @xmath0 galaxies can be characterized by optically - thick outflowing neutral @xmath5 , a finding that already narrows the range of possible avenues by which ionizing radiation can escape these galaxies .",

    "the derived @xmath5 covering fractions vary from @xmath321 to @xmath322 , over a range of continuum reddening from @xmath323 to @xmath324 .",
    "the modeling results imply that galaxies with redder uv continua have a larger covering fraction of @xmath5 and dust , with a higher line - of - sight dust column density .",
    "* the absolute escape fraction of ly@xmath6 emission , as measured through a spectroscopic slit , correlates inversely with neutral gas covering fraction .",
    "this suggests that the ly@xmath6 photons escape preferentially through sightlines that have been cleared of gas and dust .",
    "separately , the neutral gas covering fractions deduced from saturated low - ionization interstellar absorption lines , such as @xmath203 , correlate with , but systematically underpredict by a factor of @xmath325 , those derived from the @xmath5 lines .",
    "thus , inferences of gas covering fractions based on low - ionization interstellar absorption lines must be viewed with caution . moreover",

    "* we discuss our results in the context of the escape of ionizing radiation at high redshift .",

    "<S> using a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed lyman break galaxies at @xmath0 , we establish for the first time an empirical relationship between reddening ( @xmath1 ) , neutral gas covering fraction ( @xmath2 ) , and the escape of ionizing ( lyman continuum , lyc ) photons at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> our sample includes 933 galaxies at @xmath0 , 121 of which have very deep spectroscopic observations ( @xmath3hrs ) in the rest - frame far - uv ( @xmath4 ) with the low resolution imaging spectrograph on the keck telescope . </S>",
    "<S> based on the high covering fraction of outflowing optically - thick @xmath5 indicated by the composite spectra of these galaxies , we conclude that photoelectric absorption , rather than dust attenuation , dominates the depletion of lyc photons . by modeling the composite spectra as the combination of an unattenuated stellar spectrum including nebular continuum emission with one that is absorbed by @xmath5 and reddened by a line - of - sight extinction </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an empirical relationship between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies with redder uv continua have larger covering fractions of @xmath5 characterized by higher line - of - sight extinctions . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute escape fraction of ly@xmath6 correlates inversely with @xmath2 , consistent with the escape of ly@xmath6 through gas- and dust - free lines - of - sight . </S>",
    "<S> gas covering fractions based on low - ionization interstellar absorption lines systematically underpredict those deduced from the @xmath5 lines , suggesting that much of the outflowing material in these galaxies may be metal - poor . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a model which connects the ionizing escape fraction with @xmath1 , and which may be used to estimate the ionizing escape fraction for an ensemble of high - redshift galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , direct measurements of the escape fraction for the composite spectra allow us to constrain the intrinsic ionizing - to - non - ionizing flux density ratio to be @xmath7 , a value that favors stellar population models that include weaker stellar winds , a flatter initial mass function , and/or binary evolution . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we demonstrate how the framework discussed here may be used to assess the pathways by which ionizing radiation escapes from high - redshift galaxies . </S>"
