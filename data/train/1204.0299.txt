    "( example : the , that there is no cardinal number strictly between    @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is undecidable    in the zfc axiom system , assuming that zfc itself is    consistent  @xcite . )",
    "the first examples of statements    independent of a `` natural '' axiom system were constructed by    k.  gdel  @xcite .",
    "decision problem : :    a family of problems with yes / no answers is called if there is no    algorithm that terminates with the correct answer for every problem in    the family .",
    "( example : , to decide whether a multivariable polynomial    equation with integer coefficients has a solution in integers , is    undecidable  @xcite . )    in modern literature , the word `` undecidability '' is used more commonly in sense  2 , given that `` independence '' adequately describes sense  1 .    to make 2 precise , one needs a formal notion of algorithm .",
    "such notions were introduced by a.  church  @xcite and a.  turing  @xcite independently in the 1930s . from now on , we interpret algorithm to mean , which , loosely speaking , means that it is a computer program that takes as input a finite string of 0s and 1s .",
    "the role of the finite string is to specify which problem in the family is to be solved .    often in describing a family of problems , it is more convenient to use higher - level mathematical objects such as polynomials or finite simplicial complexes as input",
    ". this is acceptable if these objects can be encoded as finite binary strings .",

    "if the decision problem is undecidable in sense 2 , then at least one of its instance statements @xmath4 is undecidable in sense 1 , i.e. , independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the proof of this is easy : if every @xmath4 could be proved or disproved in @xmath2 , then the decision problem could be solved by a computer program that generates all theorems deducible from @xmath2 until it finds either @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , under the same assumptions , there must be _ infinitely many _ @xmath4 that are independent of @xmath2 , since if there were only finitely many , there would exist a decision algorithm that handled them as special cases .",
    "in all the undecidable decision problems we present , the source of the undecidability can be traced back to a single undecidable decision problem , namely the halting problem , or equivalently the membership problem for listable sets ( see sections [ s : halting problem ] and  [ s : listable ] ) . for any of these problems , in principle",

    "the reason that it is undecidable is that one can embed the halting problem in it .",
    "namely , with some work it is possible , given a computer program @xmath9 , to construct an instance of post correspondence problem that has a positive answer if and only if @xmath9 halts .",
    "because of its simplicity , the post correspondence problem is often used to prove the undecidability of other problems , for instance , in the formal theory of languages : see  @xcite .      , introduced by h. wang  @xcite*4.1 , are unit squares in the plane , with sides parallel to the axes , such that each side of each square has been assigned a color .",

    "on the other hand , the following question has remained open :    [ q : automorphism ] is there an algorithm to decide whether a given variety has a nontrivial automorphism ?    possibly related to this is the following :    [ q : prescribed automorphism group ] given an f.p .",
    "group @xmath32 , can one effectively construct a variety @xmath279 whose automorphism group is @xmath32 ?",
    "a positive answer to question  [ q : prescribed automorphism group ] would yield a negative answer to question  [ q : automorphism ] , since it is impossible to decide whether an f.p .",
    "group is trivial ( corollary  [ c : trivial group ] ) .",
    "given the undecidability of the homeomorphism problem for manifolds , it is natural to ask for the algebraic geometry analogue :    input : :    two varieties @xmath270 and @xmath271 over    @xmath280 question : :    is @xmath281 ?",
    "the question of whether this problem might be undecidable was asked to the author by b.  totaro in 2007 .",
    "we stated the problem over @xmath280 , because most algebraic geometry is done over an algebraically closed field and we wanted the input to admit a finite description .",
    "alternatively , we could work over an algebraically closed field @xmath282 of countable transcendence degree over @xmath146 ; this would capture the essence of the problem over @xmath164 , since any pair of varieties over @xmath164 may be simultaneously defined over a finitely generated subfield of @xmath164 and the existence of an isomorphism is unaffected by enlarging the ground field from one algebraically closed field to another .",
    "one could also consider other fields , such as @xmath146 , @xmath283 , @xmath284 , or @xmath285 .",
    "there is no field over which it is known whether one can solve the variety isomorphism problem .",
    "it is also unknown whether there is an algorithm to decide whether two given varieties are birationally equivalent . on the other hand ,",
    "given an explicit rational map , one can decide whether it is a birational map , and whether it is an isomorphism .    for algebraic geometers : if at least one of the varieties @xmath270 and @xmath271 over @xmath280 is of general type , then the set of birational maps @xmath286 is finite and computable ( see below ) , and we can decide which of these birational maps are isomorphisms , and hence solve the variety isomorphism problem in this restricted setting .",
    "h.  matsumura proved that the birational automorphism group of a variety of general type is finite  @xcite .",
    "the set of birational maps @xmath286 is either empty or a principal homogeneous space under this group , so it is finite too .",
    "let us sketch an algorithm for computing this set .",
    "for @xmath287 , compute the maps determined by the pluricanonical linear system @xmath288 for @xmath270 and @xmath271 until an @xmath30 is found for which at least one of the two maps is birational onto its image .",
    "then the other must be too and the linear systems must have the same dimension , say @xmath30 , since otherwise we know already that @xmath289 .",
    "the birational maps are then in bijection with the linear automorphisms of @xmath290 mapping one canonical image to the other , and we can find equations for the locus of these automorphisms as a ( finite ) subscheme of @xmath291 .",
    "if we restrict the variety isomorphism problem to the category of _ affine _ varieties , we obtain , equivalently , the isomorphism problem for finitely generated @xmath280-algebras . here",

    "one can replace @xmath280 by other rings of constants ( whose elements can be encoded for computer input ) .",
    "for example , taking @xmath141 yields the following problem :    input : :    two finitely generated commutative rings @xmath15 and    @xmath294 question : :    is @xmath295 ?    the undecidability status of this problem is unknown .",
    "in fact , the status is unknown also for the isomorphism problem for finitely generated commutative algebras over any fixed nonzero commutative ring ( with elements encoded such that addition and multiplication are computable ) .",
    "the noncommutative analogue of the previous problem is undecidable , as we now explain .",
    "let @xmath296 be the noncommutative polynomial ring ( free associative algebra with @xmath89 ) in @xmath30 variables over @xmath141 . a ( possibly noncommutative ) is the quotient of @xmath296 by the @xmath138-sided ideal generated by a finite list of elements @xmath293 .",

    "many games can be fit into this framework .",
    "a result of l.  kalmr  @xcite , building on work of e.  zermelo  @xcite and d.  knig  @xcite , states that exactly one of the two players has a winning strategy . but :    [ t : who wins ] it is impossible to decide , given @xmath302 and @xmath99 , _ which _ player has a winning strategy .",

( for a precise specification of the rules , and for related problems , see  @xcite . )    it is unknown whether this problem is decidable . on the other hand , d.  brumleve , j.  hamkins , and p.  schlicht  @xcite showed that one _ can _ decide whether white can mate in @xmath30 moves , if a starting configuration and @xmath30 are given .",
