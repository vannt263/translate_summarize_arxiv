    "the discovery of the double - pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039  @xcite provides physicists with a remarkable laboratory for relativistic astrophysics . besides its implications for the rate of gravitational wave bursts from neutron - star coalescence  @xcite and for the understanding of pulsar magnetospheres  @xcite",
    ", it could provide a measurements of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xcite noted that accurate timing over a period of years could lead to a determination of the moment of inertia of star a. spin - orbit coupling could be revealed either through an extra advancement of the periastron of the orbit above the standard post - newtonian advance , or in the precession of the orbital plane about the direction of the total angular momentum of the system .",
    "given that the masses of both stars are already accurately determined by observations , a measurement of the moment of inertia of even one neutron star could have enormous importance for neutron star physics .",
    "despite the fact that over a thousand neutron stars have been discovered in radio and x - ray observations , and accurate masses have been determined for a dozen or so neutron stars in radio pulsar binaries  @xcite , there is relatively little observational information about their radii or their interior physics .",
    "currently , one source of candidates for revealing radii are those neutron stars for which thermal x - ray and optical radiation have been observed ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "nevertheless , these stars have not yet provided a clear radius determination , because of ambiguities due to atmospheric re - processing , interstellar absorption , and distances . moreover",
    ", the inferred radius actually refers to the radiation radius , @xmath0 , which is mass - dependent ; unless independent mass measurements of the same stars become available , such as would be provided by a redshift , the radii themselves remain unknown .",
    "however , most of these sources have featureless spectra and no secure redshifts have been obtained to date from them .",
    "another possibility are x - ray bursts from the surfaces of neutron stars .",
    "recently , two lines observed in an x - ray burst spectrum have been suggested to be h- and he - like fe lines and imply a redshift of 0.35 @xcite .",
    "this inference has been given additional credibility by the detection @xcite of a 45 hz rotational frequency for the neutron star , exo 0748 - 676 .",
    "a low spin rate is consistent with the observed equivalent widths of these lines if their identifications with fe are correct .",
    "@xcite show that this consistency holds if the neutron star radius is in the range 9.515 km ( corresponding to masses in the range 1.52.3 m@xmath1 ) . since this star is a member of an eclipsing binary , an independent mass measurement might be possible , as well .",
    "these techniques hold promise of further constraining the radii of this star , and could be extended to other x - ray bursters if redshifts from them can be observed .    at present ,",
    "however , the constraints on the neutron star radius from x - ray bursters and thermal radiation from cooling neutron stars are relatively weak .",
    "we demonstrate that securing a value for the moment of inertia for a star in a radio binary pulsar system will provide important constraints on the radius of the star and the equation of state of neutron - star matter .",
    "dimensionally , the moment of inertia is proportional to the star s mass times its radius squared , so that a measurement of the moment of inertia to a given accuracy provides approximately twice the accuracy for a radius identification .",
    "we begin in  2 by exploring the remark in  @xcite that the moment of inertia can be determined from measurements of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "two observable effects pf spin - orbit coupling , precession of the orbital plane and an extra contribution to the advance of the periastron , are investigated . in  3 , the case of psr 0737 - 3039 is investigated .",
    "we conclude that a 10% measurement of the moment of inertia of star a in this system might be possible with observations extending over a period of a few years . in ",
    "4 section , we show how such a measurement leads to an estimate of the radius of the star and the density of neutron star matter in the vicinity of the nuclear saturation density , this could have crucial implications for delimiting the equation of state .",
    "the conclusion section ,  5 , compares the psr0737 - 3039 system with other relativistic binaries , and possibilities for the future of this technique are discussed .",
    "there are two kinds of spin - coupled precession effects in a binary system of compact stars : spin - orbit and spin - spin couplings .",
    "spin - orbit coupling leads to a precession of the angular momentum vector @xmath2 of the orbital plane around the direction of the total angular momentum @xmath3 of the system .",
    "this is sometimes called geodetic precession , and is related to the thomas precession of atomic physics . since the total angular momentum @xmath4 is conserved ( at this order ) , there are compensating precessions of the spins @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the two stars .",
    "since the orbital angular momentum dominates the spin angular momenta in binaries , the geodetic precession amplitude is very small while the associated spin precession amplitudes are substantial .",
    "in addition to geodetic precession , spin - orbit coupling also manifests itself in apsidal motion ( advance of the periastron ) .",
    "spin - spin coupling is negligible in close binary systems because @xmath7 .    according to @xcite , the spin and orbital angular momenta evolve according to @xmath8 where the superscript @xmath9 refers to the spin - coupling contribution only ( there are also first- and second - order post - newtonian terms , 1pn and 2pn , respectively , unrelated to the spins , that contribute to this order ) . here",
    "@xmath10 is the semimajor axis of the effective one - body orbital problem ( sum of the semi - major axes of the two stellar orbits ) , @xmath11 is the eccentricity , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 refer to the masses of the two binary components ( we use the notation that @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) . to this order , one may employ the newtonian relation for the orbital angular momentum : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the orbital period and @xmath18 .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "[ eqn : evolve , a ] , the spin precession periods are @xmath19 which are not identical for the two components unless they are of equal mass .",
    "note that the spin precession periods are independent of the spins . also note that if the spins are parallel to @xmath20 , there is , first , no spin precession , and second",
    ", the spin - orbit contribution to the advance of the periastron is in the sense opposite to the direction of motion .",
    "the spin precession leads to two observable effects .",
    "first , as the spin axis change orientation in space , the pulsar beams will sweep through changing directions in space . in many cases",
    ", this will lead to the periodic appearance and disappearance of the pulsar beam from the earth .",
    "second , since total angular momentum is conserved ( to this order ) , the orbital plane will change orientation .",
    "this will be observed as a change in the inclination angle @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite have considered the question of how these effects affect the timing of binary pulsars .",
    "for the change in inclination , they find @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angle between @xmath24 and @xmath2 and @xmath25 is the angle between the line of sight to pulsar @xmath21 and the projection of @xmath24 on the orbital plane .",
    "these angles follow the convention of @xcite , but other references employ @xmath26 in place of @xmath25 , _ cf .",
    "_ , @xcite .",
    "also , we used @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the moment of inertia and the spin period , respectively , of component @xmath21 .",
    "if we specialize to the case in which the spin of one component is much greater than that of the other , @xmath30 , the amplitude of the precession of the inclination of the orbital plane is given by the change in @xmath2 needed to compensate changes in @xmath31 .",
    "we define the angle between @xmath20 and @xmath32 to be @xmath33 and the angle between @xmath34 and @xmath32 to be @xmath35 . since @xmath36 , one has @xmath37 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath38 , one finds @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the amplitude of the change in the orbital inclination angle @xmath21 due to a s precession will be @xmath40 this will cause a periodic departure from the expected time - of - arrival of pulses from pulsar a of amplitude @xmath41 if one can assume the orbital eccentricity is small .    for the advance of the periastron , the ratio of the spin - orbit and 1pn contributions is @xcite @xmath42 in the case that @xmath30 , only the @xmath43 term contributes substantially . for comparison ,",
    "the ratio of the 2pn to 1pn contributions is @xcite @xmath44(1-e^2)^{-1}-1- { 46m_i\\over3m}+{10\\over3}\\left({m_i\\over m}\\right)^2\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq&{gm\\over24ac^2}\\left({189\\over1-e^2}-47\\right)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where both @xmath43 and @xmath45 terms contribute .",
    "the second line of eq .",
    "[ eqn : a2pn ] is valid in the case that @xmath46 .    in  4",
    "we demonstrate that a very useful constraint on the equation of state ( eos ) can be made if the moment of inertia can be determined to about 10% . in practice",
    ", it is expected that the binary components will have approximately equal masses but differing spin periods .",
    "therefore , the spin - orbit effects will be dominated by the more radidly rotating star , a. besides being functions of the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath21 , the observables @xmath48 and @xmath49 are also functions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , extraction of @xmath52 from these observables requires that additional information about the orientation of the spin of a be available .",
    "fortunately , if a is observed as a pulsar , observations of the beam geometry and its precession can provide this information .",
    "the observational parameters for the system psr 0737 - 3039 are summarized in @xcite : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 s , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 s , and @xmath59 day .",
    "we therefore observe that @xmath60 yrs and @xmath61 yrs . with these parameters , we can form the useful combinations @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a typical value for the moment of inertia ( see  4 ) .    since @xmath64",
    ", we can ignore contributions to the precession from pulsar b. the orientation of the spin axis of @xmath65 relative to the orbital plane has been estimated through modeling of the intensity variations of pulsar b due to illumination by emission from a @xcite .",
    "there are two solutions to this model : solution 1 with @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 , and solution 2 with @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "however , solution 1 is preferred on two grounds : it is improbable that a supernova kick would result in a spin axis that is so strongly misaligned with the orbital angular momentum , and solution 2 is also inconsistent with the misalignment angle between @xmath31 and the magnetic dipole axis , measured to be a few degrees @xcite . we assume solution 1 for the following discussion .",
    "the orientation of b has not been estimated so far , but this is irrelevant since the spin of pulsar b can be ignored .",
    "recent determinations of the inclination angle are @xmath71 @xcite and @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "we shall use the latter as being the more precise .",
    "the facts that the orbit is seen nearly edge - on and that @xmath31 is only slightly misaligned from @xmath20 makes this a special case in which the amplitude of the timing change produced by the orbial plane precession will be extremely small , @xmath73s . not only is the magnitude very small , but the large relative uncertainties in both @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) and in @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) combine to give a huge uncertainty in @xmath48 .",
    "current technology allows timing accuracies at the level of tenths of microseconds , limited by the quality of clocks and the characterization of radio antenna signal paths  @xcite .",
    "given this sensitivity , observation of the changing inclination due to orbital precession seems marginal .",
    "even if timing sensitivities to order 0.01@xmath78s were possible , errors in both @xmath21 and @xmath50 would have to be substantially reduced in order to measure @xmath52 to order 10% .    the periastron advance due to spin - orbit coupling",
    ", being proportional to @xmath79 and @xmath80 , is , on the other hand , less sensitive to errors in these angles . in addition , since @xmath81 , eq .",
    "[ eqn : periastron ] shows that uncertainties in the angle @xmath51 become largely irrelevant .",
    "the 1pn perihelion advance is @xmath82 or 0.294 radians per year .",
    "the periastron advance ratio is @xmath83 .    in practice , to measure the spin - orbit effect to 10% means subracting out the spinless pieces of the perihelion precession ( @xmath84 and @xmath85 ) to one part in about @xmath86 .",
    "fortunately , both @xmath87 and @xmath17 are well known , and will be even better known in the future , and the spinless periastron advance depends only on the total mass , not the individual masses .",
    "the total mass @xmath88 is known to the accuracy of @xmath89 .",
    "but @xmath89 is currently known to about 2 parts in a @xmath90 , using the determination of @xcite , and its accuracy will also improve with time .",
    "so measurement of the spin - orbit perihelion advance seems possible .",
    "nevertheless , the determination of @xmath52 from this technique will only be as accurate as our understanding of @xmath50 .",
    "an uncertainty in @xmath91 of better than 6% has already been achieved .",
    "further improvements in our knowledge of the pulse geometry , which seems likely , suggest that a moment of inertia determination accurate to 10% , may be possible .",
    "the epoch of periastron changes due to spin - orbit coupling by about 0.027 seconds per year . for comparison , the second post - newtonian correction contributes a periastron advance time of about 0.02 seconds per year and must therefore be included in the pulsar timing model .",
    "the estimation of a neutron star s moment of inertia from timing observations of a radio binary pulsar has significant implications for constraining the equation of state ( eos ) . in some respects , a moment of inertia measurement",
    "could be more useful than a radius measurement of the same accuracy .",
    "first , the neutron star mass in a radio binary will obviously already be known to high precision , while a radius measurement from observations of thermal radiation actually refers to the radiation radius @xmath0 . to obtain the radius and mass",
    "separately requires an estimate of the star s",
    "redshift @xmath92 which so far is not yet available for any thermal source .",
    "moreover , the accuracy of radiation radius estimates from thermal sources are limited by uncertainties due to source atmospheric re - processing , interstellar absorption , and distances . in the case of x - ray bursters ,",
    "the one case in which a redshift measurement may be secure , exo 0748 - 676 , no independent mass measurement is yet available , and radius information obtained from fitting the line profile with the observed rotation rate is relatively weak .",
    "mass and moment of inertia measurements from radio binary pulsars are not sensitive to estimates of the distance , and a redshift is not required .",
    "second , the range of moments of inertia for various neutron star models ( including strange quark matter stars ) is , in relative terms , larger than the predicted range of radii ( see fig . [ mom ] ) .",
    "this follows from the dimensional relation @xmath93 . for example",
    ", it is 30 to 240 m@xmath1 km@xmath94 for masses larger than 1 m@xmath1 , and is 53 to 109 m@xmath1 km@xmath94 for a 1.4 m@xmath1 star . for comparison ,",

    "<S> we estimate that the moment of inertia of star a in the recently discovered double pulsar system psr j0737 - 3039 may be determined after a few years of observation to something like 10% accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> this would enable accurate estimates of the radius of the star and the presure of matter in the vicinity of 1 to 2 times the nuclear saturation density , which would in turn provide strong constraints on the equation of state of neutron stars and the physics of their interiors . </S>"
