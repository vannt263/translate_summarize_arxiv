    "increasing spatial resolution allows to observe directly parts of active galactic nuclei . however , the innermost part is still unresolved and the information about its geometrical structure comes from spectroscopy .",
    "this structure is very complex , so vigorous discussions of inflow / outflow are still going on . among this unsolved problems",
    "is the origin of broad emission lines .",
    "broad emission lines come from a specific broad emission line region ( blr ) , as seen in well separation of the broad and narrow components in the emission lines of active galaxies .",
    "they cover significant fraction of the agn sky , between 10 and 30 % , as implied by their luminosity , but they are rarely seen in absorption ( for rare exceptions , see e.g. risaliti et al .",
    "2011 ) which argues for the flat configuration ( e.g. nikolajuk et al . 2005 , collin et al .",
    "2006 ) , mostly hidden inside the outer dusty - molecular torus .",
    "the motion of the material is roughly consistent with circular keplerian orbits ( wandel et al .",
    "1999 ) , but with significant additional velocity dispersion .",
    "careful studies indicate two components of the blr ( collin - souffrin et al .",
    "1988 ) : high ionization lines ( hil ; e.g. civ ) and low ionization lines ( lil ; e.g. h@xmath0 , mg ii ) .",
    "hil show blueshift with respect to narrow lines and they are considered to be comming from outflowing wind .",
    "lil do not show significant shift so can not come from outflow , but the region can not be supported by the hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of lil is difficult to understand from theoretical point of view , and it is also not resolved by direct monitoring ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "here we show that the combination of the simplest accretion disk theory and the reverberation measurement of the blr distance leads to surprising conclusion : the effective temperature of the accretion disk at the radius measured from reverberation is universal and equal to 1000 k. the argument goes in the following way ( for more details , see czerny & hryniewicz 2011 ) .    the measurements of the delay of the h@xmath0 line with respect to the continuum at 5100 a for close to 40 objects allowed to determine the relation between the blr size , as measured from such delay , and the monochromatic flux ( kaspi et al . 2000 , peterson et al .",
    "the most recent form of this relation , corrected for the starlight contamination , was derived by bentz et al .",
    "this relation can be written in the following way @xmath1 = 1.538 \\pm 0.027 + 0.5 \\log l_{44,5100 } , \\label{bentz}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 $ ] is in light days and @xmath3 is the monochromatic luminosity at 5100    measured in units of @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 .",
    "the value 0.027 is the error in the best - fit vertical normalization .",
    "now , from the simplest theory of the alpha disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) we can find the monochromatic flux . the asymptotic formula is usually known in the form @xmath6 but the proportionality coefficient is also known , and depends on the black hole mass , @xmath7 , and accretion rate , @xmath8 as @xmath9 . taking into account this dependence , physical constants and fixing the frequency at the value corresponding to the wavelength 5100 a , we have @xmath10 this formula allows us to calculate the blr radius from the eq .",
    "[ bentz ] , if the product of ( @xmath11 ) is known .",
    "the shakura - sunyaev accretion disk theory allows us to calculate the effective temperature of the disk at that radius as a function of the black hole mass and accretion rate @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "since blr is far from the central black hole , the inner boundary effect can be neglected .    when we combine eqs .",
    "[ bentz ] , [ l5100 ] , and [ teff ] , the dependence on the unknown mass and accretion rate vanishes , and we obtain a single value for all the sources in the sample @xmath14 where the error reflects the error in the constant in eq .  [ bentz ] .",
    "we stress that the resulting value does not depend either on the black hole mass or accretion rate .",
    "the value is universal , for all sources .",
    "the value of the universal temperature of @xmath15 k immediately hints that the physical mechanism of the blr formation is related to the dust formation in the accretion disk atmosphere .",
    "the dust opacity is large , and even moderate radiation flux from the underlying disk can push the dusty material off the disk surface .",
    "this dusty outflow , however , can not proceed too far from the disk plane .",
    "lifted material is irradiated by the strong uv and x - ray flux from the central region , the material heats up , the dust evaporates , the opacity rapidly decreases , and in the absence of the strong radiation pressure the material fall back again onto the disk surface .",
    "therefore , such a failed wind can account for lifting the material relatively high above the disk plane and at the same time does not give a strong systematic signatures of outflow since both outflow and inflow are present .",
    "the overall geometry is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the blr region starts were the disk effective temperature , without irradiation from the central region , falls below 1000 k , and it ends up at larger distance when the material has the temperature below 1000 k even if the irradiation is included .",
    "this outer radius marks the transition to the outer dusty / molecular torus , where the irradiation is too weak to lead to dust evaporation and the outflow proceeds .",
    "it was already proposed by watson et al ( 2011 ) that eq .",
    "2.1 can be used to determine the distance to a quasar in a way independent from the redshift .",
    "reverberation measures the blr size directly from the time delay , and eq .",
    "2.1 gives us the intrinsic monochromatic luminosity .",
    "this , combined with the observed monochromatic luminosity , gives the luminosity distance to the source .",
    "if a number of distant quasars are measured , a luminosity distance vs. redshift diagram can be constructed .",
    "our interpretation of the blr formation supports the view that eq .",
    "2.1 can apply to high redshift objects as well , since the mechanism is based on dust formation , this in turn is connected with medium metalicity , and the metalicity of distant quasars is known to be roughly solar .    with this in mind , we started a monitoring program with the southern africal large telescope .",
    "we choose intermediate quasars and mg ii line which belongs to lil class , as h@xmath0 , and should not show rapid intrinsic variations characteristic for civ line .",
    "in order to test the feasibility of spectroscopic studies of the corresponding objects we have obtained a pair of medium resolution spectra of the quasar lbqs 2113 - 4538 .",
    "the observations have been performed using the robert stobie spectrograph on southern africal large telescope in the service mode .",
    "the observing data was collected in two blocks , in the nights may 15/16 , 2012 ( ut ) and july 30/31 , 2012 ( ut ) .",
    "each block consists of a pair of 978 second exposures of the target spectrum followed by an exposure of the spectrum of the argon calibration lamp , and a set of flat - field images .",
    "initial data reduction steps : gain correction , cross - talk correction , overscan bias subtraction and amplifier mosaicking have been performed by the salt observatory staff using a semi - automated pipeline from the salt pyraf package .",
    "flat - field correction and further reduction steps have been performed using procedures within the iraf package .",
    "the pairs of adjacent spectrum images of lbqs 2113 - 4538 have been combined into a single image .",
    "this enabled us to efficiently reject cosmic rays and raise the signal to noise ratio .",
    "identification of the lines in the calibration lamp spectrum , wavelength calibration , image rectification and extraction of one dimensional spectra have been done using functions from noao.twodspec package within iraf .",
    "days ( preliminary results ) made with salt .",

    "2 we present the two profiles of mgii line in the observed object .",
    "the shape of the line has clearly changed during the @xmath16 days period between the first and the second exposure .",
    "the line intensity has changed by 9 % .",
    "thess facts allow for a systematic monitoring of this source .",
    "we now perform monte carlo simulations in order to optimize the project .",
    "we propose that dust forms not only in the outer dusty / molecular torus , but also closer in , in the non - irradiated thin disk atmosphere .",
    "this dust is responsible for the formation of the failed wind which accounts for the formation of the low ionization line part of the broad line region .",
    "this interpretation automatically explains why the size of the blr scales with the square root of the monochromatic , instead of bolometric , luminosity .",
    "it also solves the problem of high turbulence in the region without signatures of the systematic outflow . since the this mechanism of blr formation seems universal , and there is no strong metalicity gradients in quasars up to high redshift , this also justifies the use eq .",
