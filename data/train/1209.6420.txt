    "understanding the properties of diffuse molecular gas , where hydrogen makes the transition from being predominantly atomic to predominantly molecular , is key for understanding the formation of molecular clouds  with consequent implications for both star formation and galactic evolution .",

    "both the metallicities and the average dust - to - gas ratios are lower in the magellanic clouds  by factors of 23 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and 45 in the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) ( e.g. , smith 1999 ; see also references in appendices to welty et al . 1997 , 1999 ; welty , xue , & wong 2012 ) .",
    "the ambient uv radiation fields are ( on average ) stronger by factors of a few ( e.g. , lequeux 1989 ) , and the fields within the interstellar clouds are further modified by differences in uv extinction , especially in the smc ( e.g. , gordon et al .",
    "2003 ; cartledge et al . 2005 ) .",
    "such environmental differences are predicted to significantly affect both the structure and the composition of diffuse molecular clouds .",
    "for example , the photon - dominated regions surrounding largely molecular cores are expected to be more extensive in the magellanic clouds , as are regions of so - called dark molecular gas , with significant amounts of h@xmath0 not traced by co emission ( maloney & black 1988 ; pak et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the interplay between the lower metallicities , differences in relative elemental abundances , and such structural differences will likely yield both obvious and subtler differences in the abundances of various molecular species , in both relatively diffuse and denser clouds ( e.g. , johansson 1997 ) .",
    "studies of these two nearby low - metallicity systems  where we know the stellar abundances and can compare emission and absorption diagnostics in many locations  thus can provide insights into both interstellar chemical processes and the conditions in more distant low - metallicity galaxies , where the systems are poorly resolved and the information is not as complete .",

    "1994 ) . comparisons with maps of the 21 cm emission from and the ir emission from dust , which is thought to trace both atomic and molecular gas , however , strongly suggest that there is a significant amount of more diffuse molecular gas present outside the molecular cores seen in co ( e.g. , leroy et al .",

    "moreover , carbon is typically depleted by less than a factor of 3 in the galactic ism ( e.g. , jenkins 2009 ) , so that even a complete lack of depletion could not increase the carbon abundance by the necessary factor of 45 ( or 810 , in view of the lower overall smc carbon abundance ) .",

    "for example , welty et al . ( 2006 ) conjectured that the galactic - like ch abundances in several lmc sight lines might be due to nonthermal formation of ch , together with ch@xmath12 , in more extensive photon - dominated regions ( e.g. , zsarg & federman 2003 ) . since ch is a chemical predecessor of c@xmath0 , enhanced ch might thus lead to a correspondingly higher c@xmath0 abundance .",

    "unfortunately , the lack of data for higher rotational levels precludes a full analysis of the excitation . in order to estimate the total c@xmath1 column density ,",

    "[ fig : c3sk ] ) suggests that the higher-@xmath2 populations could not contribute much more than the resulting 15 per cent of the total @xmath9(c@xmath1 ) .",
    "both the differences in kinetic temperature and density inferred from c@xmath0 and h@xmath0 and the rather high density inferred from c@xmath0 may reflect several factors .",
    "@xmath3(c@xmath0 ) is often smaller than t@xmath71(h@xmath0 ) in galactic sight lines , suggesting that c@xmath0 may generally be concentrated in colder , denser regions than h@xmath0 ( e.g. , sonnentrucker et al .",
    "moreover , theoretical models of interstellar clouds predict that higher pressures / densities are needed for a stable cold , neutral phase in lower - metallicity systems like the smc ( due to reduced cooling , which is normally dominated by fine - structure emission ; e.g. , wolfire et al .",

    "diffuse molecular clouds in the lower - metallicity smc may have ( relatively ) more extensive outer zones , where h@xmath0 is self - shielded but other molecules are still strongly subject to photodissociation ( e.g. , pak et al . 1998 ) , and the density contrast between the inner and outer zones might be more extreme . while a higher @xmath9[h@xmath0(@xmath2=4 ) ] ( see footnote 1 ) would increase the density inferred from h@xmath0 , it would also imply a stronger uv radiation field .",
    "if the near - ir field were correspondingly stronger , then the density inferred from c@xmath0 would also be higher",
    ".    the high density implied by the excitation of c@xmath0 may also be partly an artefact of the outdated molecular data embedded in the analysis originally proposed by van dishoeck and black ( 1982 ) .",
    "although the more recent analyses of c@xmath0 column density and hydrogen number density have been scaled for improved values of oscillator strengths in the a - x , d - x , and f - x electronic transitions , they have not incorporated recent improvements in collisional excitation rates .",
    "the downward rates for inelastic collisions of c@xmath0 with he ( najar et al .",
    "2008 ) and ground - state h@xmath0 ( najar et al . 2009 ) are larger than and vary with @xmath2 differently from the rates based on the simple scaling law adopted by van dishoeck and black ( 1982 ) .",
    "a partial update of the old model suggests that the inferred density toward sk  143 has been slightly overestimated , but not by a factor as large as two ; similar analyses of galactic sight lines would also be affected .",
    "casu & cecchi - pestellini ( 2012 ) have computed models of c@xmath0 excitation based on new molecular data .",
    "there is no simple trend in inferred density ; rather , casu & cecchi - pestellini ( 2012 ) contend that existing observations of diffuse molecular clouds are best fitted by inhomogeneous models with both dense and diffuse phases .",
    "much more work on the excitation models is needed : reliable collision rates for ortho - h@xmath0 and atomic h do not exist and chemical effects have not yet been taken into account .",
    "we have discussed the first detection of absorption from interstellar c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 beyond our galaxy  toward sk 143 , located in the near wing region of the smc .",
    "the total abundances of c@xmath0 and c@xmath1 ( relative to h@xmath0 ) are similar to those found in diffuse galactic molecular clouds ",
    "consistent with previous results for ch , cn , and several diffuse interstellar bands  despite the significantly lower overall metallicity of the smc . while a higher metallicity toward sk  143 can not be completely ruled out , we believe that the enhanced molecular abundances are much more likely to reflect environmental factors  in particular the higher than usual @xmath5/@xmath38 ratio  affecting the chemistry in that smc sight line .",
    "analysis of the rotational excitation of c@xmath0 ( @xmath2 = 08 ) yields an estimated kinetic temperature @xmath3 @xmath4 25 k and a total hydrogen density @xmath5 @xmath4 870 @xmath6  compared to the @xmath7 @xmath4 45 k and @xmath5 @xmath4 85300 @xmath6 obtained from h@xmath0 .",
    "the populations of the lower rotational levels of c@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = 012 ) are consistent with an excitation temperature of about 34 k. the differences in @xmath3 and density inferred from c@xmath0 and h@xmath0 may reflect differences in the distribution of the two molecular species within the main cloud / component in this sight line ; such differences may be more pronounced at low metallicities .",
