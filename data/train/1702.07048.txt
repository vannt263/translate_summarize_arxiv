    "it is to be emphasized that differences between the ensemble members represent an inherent property of the problem , internal variability , and can not only be associated with ` measurement errors ' .",

    "we calculate the peak - to - peak time differences for each ensemble members , after a removal of a 5th order polynomial trend and applying a 61-point running mean for smoothing .",
    "the statistics of the obtained values of @xmath41 combined from all experimental runs shows a significant shift when comparing the @xmath43 and @xmath34 periods ; the mean increased from 199.2 s to 214.7 s ( by around 8% ) , the median from 183 s to 209 s ( by around 14% ) .",
    "this finding is consistent with the theoretical expectations : smaller @xmath0 yields cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies of smaller size , scaling with the so - called rossby deformation radius @xmath44 , i.e. proportionally to the square root of the imposed temperature gradient@xcite : @xmath45 .",
    "whereas the drift velocity @xmath46 of baroclinic eddies is determined by the thermal wind balance and scales as @xmath47 , where the exponent @xmath48 has been found to be between 0.88 and 1.17 in earlier experiments@xcite , @xmath49 being the theoretical value .",
    "thus , the crossing timescale is expected to follow a @xmath50 dependence , yielding an increasing trend with decreasing @xmath51 in time . even in this respect",
    ", single - realisation statistics could be misleading : due to the ( geostrophic ) turbulent nature of the flow the values of @xmath41 exhibit large variance in all cases that can easily suppress the slight trend .",
    "further exploring temporal correlations we apply the method of detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa)@xcite , a strandard procedure for measuring the variability of a signal around its local trend in time windows of length @xmath52 samples as a function of @xmath52 .",
    "dfa4 removes local ( cubic ) trends , thus it is more suitable for our present purpose than e.g. fourier transforms , since dfa4 can readily handle nonstationarities ( methods ) .",
    "the dfa4 spectra from all realisations ( fig .",

    "thus , it can be stated that the ` quality ' of geostrophic turbulence did not change throughout the ` climate change ' period .    concerning the differences between the stationary ( @xmath43 ) and ` changing ' ( @xmath34 ) records ( turquoise and orange curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4]a , respectively ) , their fluctuations up to a window size @xmath63 s are perfectly identical in the statistical sense .",
    "this is also apparent from the averages of the two sets of spectra in fig .",

    "multiplying the fluctuation spectra of the ensemble averages by @xmath77 ( @xmath78 being the sample size of the ensemble ) yields perfect match with the average of the single - realisation spectra .",
    "this property shows that the fluctuations of different realisations are perfectly uncorrelated on all time scales @xmath79 : uncorrelated fluctuations average out following @xmath80 , whereas ` ensemble - correlated ' fluctuations would remain unaffected by the ensemble averaging . here",

    "obviously , on the time scale of @xmath81 collective behaviour does exist  the trend itself  but such large time windows are not sampled properly and are not evaluated in the spectra .",
    "the lack of collective fluctuations on the sub-@xmath81 scales highlights the largely nonlinear nature of the system s response to changing forcing .",
    "the time - scale  dependence of variability amplification caused by ` climate change ' is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig4]b , where the ratios of dfa4 fluctuation spectra in the ` changing ' phase relative to the ` base period ' of the same run  and those of the ensemble average  are plotted .",

    "[ fig4]a . ) here again it becomes manifest that ` climate change ' does not affect the variability on the time scales below @xmath76 from the ensemble average point of view ( the average amplification is close to zero ) , still , one can also easily spot individual realisations with either markedly increased or decreased variability in this spectral band as well .    above @xmath76 all realisations exhibit clearly amplified variability .",
    "for the ensemble average it reaches a maximum increase of 47% at around @xmath76 and stays around 20% for the @xmath64 timescales up to @xmath82 s.    to determine the statistical significance of the above results , we have carried out monte carlo statistical testing using a standard inverse - fourier surrogate data method@xcite ( methods ) .",
    "the null - hypothesis of the testing is that there are no fundamental changes in the dynamics of fluctuations between the @xmath27 ` base period ' and the @xmath28 ` warming phase ' . if this was the case , the fluctuations during the warming would exhibit very similar distribution and spectral properties as in the base period , superimposed onto a warming trend . in order to model this hypothesis , 10 model ` warming ' time series were created for each of the 9 ensemble members ( i.e. 90 time series in total ) using the fourier amplitude spectra of their corresponding ` base periods ' but shuffling their phases .",
    "the resulting model series were then superimposed onto a polynomial warming trend , imitating the temporal development of the ensemble average @xmath83 , shown in fig .",

    "can be understood as a measure of variability that is due to finite - size effects of the imposed trend itself .",

    "the present work provides , to the best of our knowledge , the first results from any laboratory experiment aiming to model the effects of climate change on mid - latitude atmospheric circulation .",
    "the authors do not claim that the lessons learned from the presented experimental minimal model could be directly applied or compared to the processes of the earth system and the ongoing climate change .",
    "perfect hydrodynamic similarity is impossible to achieve , thus the ratios between all of the relevant timescales ( corresponding to the rotation , baroclinic adjustment , crossing time of cyclones , the changing of the temperature contrast @xmath0 ) can not be set to scale properly . nevertheless , the studied model as a dynamical system does share some important features with the climate system on the conceptual level : both are rotating , turbulent hydrodynamic systems , driven by the incoming differential heat fluxes , a forcing that changes in time . due to the time - dependence of the forcing",
    ", these systems can not reach an equilibrium state .",
    "therefore , if one intends to survey the variability between the possible outcomes of such a process at any time instant , it is essential to consider a whole ensemble of realisations , subject to the same forcing scenario and differing only in their initial conditions .    despite of the large variability of the ensemble that is due to the nonlinear nature of the processes and the finite length of the studied records , the fluid dynamical interpretation of the observed flow phenomena is relatively straightforward .",
    "the system is in the state of well - developed geostrophic turbulence , that yields a power - law scaling in the power spectra of the fluctuations in both the wavenumber- and the frequency domain ( supplementary ) .",
    "the characteristic size of the cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies ( corresponding to warm and cold temperature anomalies , respectively ) tends to decrease as the ` meridional ' temperature gradient drops , in agreement with the theoretical expectations . in parallel ,",
    "the zonal drift velocities decrease even faster during the process , therefore the characteristic timescale of ` weather change ' at a fixed measurement location increases significantly .",
    "this timescale is of the same order as the typical response time of the flow to the changes in the forcing ( baroclinic adjustment ) therefore fluctuations were found to increase markedly in this spectral band .",
    "`` one experiment is no experiment '' has been the mantra of researchers for ages , but the idea behind the saying has always been the separation of measurement errors from significant signals . here",
    ", however , the fluctuations are just as inherent , fully deterministic and dominant features of the underlying nonlinear processes  just like in the earth system  as the large - scale trends themselves .",
    "the reason for the increasing ensemble variance lies in the system s extreme sensitivity to initial conditions  a ubiquitous property of chaotic , long - range correlated systems .",
    "the authors firmly believe that the only proper approach for carrying out laboratory experiments on non - stationary turbulence would be conducting and systematically evaluating , ensembles of runs . in observational climatology",
    "this is not a viable option ; we have only one earth .",
    "yet , the present experimental demonstration may help to increase awareness of the fact that a climate - like dynamical system can undergo a transition towards larger variability even without noticeable effects on the temporal fluctuations of one particular realisation .",
    "this message applies to the gcm community as well : climate variability information from a single numerical run ( e.g. co2 doubling scenario ) could be misleading as it does not necessarily represent the full complexity of the underlying ensemble dynamics .",

    "<S> there is an ongoing debate in the literature about whether the present global warming is increasing local and global temperature variability @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the central methodological issues of this debate relate to the proper treatment of normalised temperature anomalies and trends in the studied time series which may be difficult to separate from time - evolving fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> some argue that temperature variability is indeed increasing globally @xcite , whereas others conclude it is decreasing or remains practically unchanged @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , a consensus appears to emerge that local variability in certain regions ( e.g. western europe and north america ) has indeed been increasing in the past 40 years @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the nature of connections between external forcing and climate variability conceptually by using a laboratory - scale minimal model of mid - latitude atmospheric thermal convection subject to continuously decreasing ` equator - to - pole ' temperature contrast @xmath0 , mimicking climate change . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of temperature records from an ensemble of experimental runs ( ` realisations ' ) all driven by identical time - dependent external forcing reveals that the collective variability of the ensemble and that of individual realisations may be markedly different  a property to be considered when interpreting climate records . </S>"
