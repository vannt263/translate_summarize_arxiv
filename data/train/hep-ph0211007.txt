    "the measurement of the proton s spin - dependent deep - inelastic structure function @xmath3 by the emc  @xcite more than a decade ago made once again the spin structure of the nucleon an exciting topic , which deservedly continues to spark large activity by both theorists and experimentalists .",
    "the original result , that the total quark spin contribution to the nucleon spin is only of the order of about @xmath4 has subsequently been confirmed by other experiments and is well - established today . for various reasons that we will not review here , gluons may very well play a more important role for the proton spin than quarks .",
    "consequently , there is now a flurry of experimental activity aiming at measuring the polarization of gluons in the nucleon . in terms of a parton density ,",
    "the required information is contained in  @xcite @xmath5 written in @xmath6 gauge , where @xmath7 is the gluon s light - cone momentum fraction of the proton momentum @xmath8 , and @xmath9 the factorization scale appearing in a hard process to which the gluon contributes .",
    "@xmath10 is the field strength tensor , and @xmath11 its dual . in more simple terms",
    ", @xmath12 describes the difference in probabilities for finding a gluon with positive or negative helicity in a proton with positive helicity , at `` resolution '' scale @xmath9 : @xmath13 where superscripts ( subscripts ) denote the proton ( gluon ) helicity .",
    "deeply - inelastic scattering ( dis ) , @xmath14 , is a standard process for studying nucleon structure .",
    "however , it is not an ideal process for measuring the gluon content of the nucleon , due to the fact that the virtual photon in dis couples directly only to quarks .",
    "inclusive structure functions therefore depend on the gluon density only through scale - evolution , and through higher orders in qcd perturbation theory .",
    "this explains why the existing polarized - dis data have told us very little about @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "one may attempt to get access to the gluon density by selecting the photon - gluon - fusion process in dis , which contributes to final states such as heavy flavor pairs , or high - transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) hadron pairs .",
    "indeed , the compass experiment  @xcite at cern and hermes  @xcite at desy follow this approach . unfortunately , the rather low energy in these fixed - target experiments and the ensuing large systematic uncertainties in the theoretical predictions complicate these efforts significantly .",
    "dedicated experiments at a possibly forthcoming future polarized @xmath16 collider , like the eic  @xcite , would presumably make these channels more promising , however .",
    "the bnl relativistic heavy - ion collider rhic  @xcite is able to run in a mode with polarized protons .",
    "very inelastic @xmath1 collisions will then open up unequaled possibilities to measure @xmath15 .",
    "rhic has the advantage of operating at high energies ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 gev ) , where the theoretical description is under good control .",
    "in addition , it offers various different channels in which @xmath19 can be studied , such as prompt photon production , jet production , creation of heavy flavor pairs , or inclusive - hadron production . in this way",
    ", rhic is expected to provide the best source of information on @xmath15 for a long time to come .",
    "the basic concept that underlies most of spin physics at rhic is the factorization theorem  @xcite , which states that large momentum - transfer reactions may be factorized into long - distance pieces that contain the desired information on the ( spin ) structure of the nucleon in terms of its parton densities such as @xmath12 , and parts that are short - distance and describe the hard interactions of the partons .",
    "the two crucial points here are that on the one hand the long - distance contributions are universal , i.e. , they are the same in any inelastic reaction under consideration , and that on the other hand the short - distance pieces depend only on the large scales related to the large momentum transfer in the overall reaction and , therefore , can be evaluated using qcd perturbation theory .",
    "the factorized structure forces one to introduce into the calculation a scale of the order of the hard scale in the reaction  but not specified further by the theory  that separates the short- and long - distance contributions .",
    "this scale is the factorization scale @xmath9 mentioned above .    as an example , let us consider the spin - dependent cross section for the reaction @xmath20 , where the pion is at high transverse momentum , ensuring large momentum transfer .",
    "this is the reaction we study in the following .",
    "the spin - dependent differential cross section is defined as @xmath21 \\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] where again the superscripts denote the helicities of the protons in the scattering .",
    "the statement of the factorization theorem is then : @xmath22 % & & % \\times \\ , d\\delta \\hat{\\sigma}_{ab}^{c } ( x_ap_a , x_bp_b , p_{\\pi}/z_c , \\mu_r , \\mu_f , \\mu_f ' ) \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all contributing partonic channels @xmath23 , with @xmath24 the associated partonic cross section , defined in complete analogy with eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , the helicities now referring to partonic ones : @xmath25 \\;\\ ; .\\ ] ]    a few further comments are in order here .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is actually a slight extension of the factorization theorem compared to what we stated above : the fact that we are observing a specific hadron in the reaction requires the introduction of additional long - distance functions , the parton - to - pion fragmentation functions @xmath26 .",
    "these functions have been determined with some accuracy by observing leading pions in @xmath27 collisions and in dis .",
    "even though there is certainly room for improvement in our knowledge of the @xmath26 , we assume for this study that the fragmentation functions are sufficiently known .    secondly , we have displayed the full set of required scales in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . besides the factorization scale @xmath9 for the initial - state partons , there is also a factorization scale @xmath28 for the absorption of long - distance effects into the fragmentation functions .",
    "in addition , we have a renormalization scale @xmath29 associated with the running strong coupling constant @xmath30 .",
    "as mentioned above , the partonic cross sections may be evaluated in perturbation theory .",
    "schematically , they can be expanded as @xmath31 @xmath32 is the leading - order ( lo ) approximation to the partonic cross section and is , for our case of pion production , obtained from evaluating all basic @xmath33 qcd scattering diagrams .",
    "it is therefore of order @xmath34 .",
    "the lowest order , however , can generally only serve to give a rough description of the reaction under study .",
    "it merely captures the main features , but does not usually provide a quantitative understanding . the first - order (",
    "`` next - to - leading order '' [ nlo ] ) corrections are generally indispensable in order to arrive at a firmer theoretical prediction for hadronic cross sections .",
    "for instance , the dependence on the unphysical factorization and renormalization scales is expected to be much reduced when going to higher orders in the perturbative expansion . only with knowledge of the nlo corrections",
    "can one reliably extract information on the parton distribution functions from the reaction .",
    "this is true , in particular , for spin - dependent cross sections , where both the polarized parton densities and the polarized partonic cross sections may have zeros in the kinematical regions of interest , near which the predictions at lowest order and the next order will show marked differences .",
    "there has been a lot of effort in recent years  [ 10 - 15 ] to obtain the nlo corrections for the spin - dependent cross sections most relevant for the rhic spin program . by",
    "now , essentially the only remaining uncalculated corrections are those for the partonic cross sections in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , i.e. , inclusive pion production .",
    "these corrections will be presented in this paper .",
    "we emphasize that it is very appropriate to provide the nlo corrections at this time : it is planned for the coming rhic run ( early 2003 ) to attempt a first measurement of @xmath15 through exactly the spin asymmetry @xmath35 for high-@xmath0 pion production .",
    "the main underlying idea here is that @xmath2 is very sensitive to @xmath15 through the contributions from polarized quark - gluon and gluon - gluon scatterings .",
    "we note that the phenix collaboration has recently presented first , still preliminary , results for the unpolarized cross section for @xmath36 at @xmath17  gev , which are well described by the nlo qcd calculation  @xcite , providing confidence that the theoretical framework based on perturbative - qcd hard scattering and summarized by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is adequate .",
    "section  2 gives an outline of the calculation , summarizing the main ingredients . in sec .",
    "3 we present some first numerical applications of our results .",
    "the `` parton - model '' type picture employed in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) implies that the partonic cross sections @xmath37 are single - inclusive cross sections for the reactions @xmath38 , i.e. , summed over all final states ( excluding @xmath39 ) possible at the order considered , and integrated over the entire phase space of @xmath40 . writing out eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) explicitly to nlo , we have @xmath41 & \\times &   \\,\\left [   \\frac{d\\delta \\hat{\\sigma}^{c,(0)}_{ab}(v)}{dv }   \\delta ( 1-w ) + \\frac{\\alpha_s(\\mu_r)}{\\pi } \\ , \\frac{d\\delta   \\hat{\\sigma}^{c,(1)}_{ab}(s , v , w,\\mu_r,\\mu_f,\\mu_f')}{dvdw } \\right ] \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 , with hadron - level variables @xmath43 and corresponding partonic ones @xmath44 neglecting all masses , one has the relations @xmath45    the lo partonic cross sections @xmath46 are calculated from the @xmath33 qcd scattering processes , that is , @xmath40 consists of only one parton , and its phase space is trivial and leads to the @xmath47 factor in eq .",
    "( [ eq1old ] ) . we do not need to present the cross sections here , which have been known for a long time for both the unpolarized and the polarized cases  @xcite .",
    "there are actually only four generic reactions , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 ; all other processes follow from crossing if one works in terms of helicity amplitudes for each reaction , keeping all particles polarized .",
    "all tree - level @xmath33 helicity amplitudes are given in  @xcite .",
    "the four generic processes give rise to the ten separate lo channels @xmath52 the `` observed '' final - state parton fragmenting into the hadron . at nlo",
    ", we have @xmath53 corrections to the above reactions , and also the additional new processes @xmath54    a single - inclusive - parton cross section is , of course , not a priori infrared - finite in qcd , but sensitive to long - distance dynamics through the presence of collinear singularities that arise when the momenta of partons in the initial or final states become parallel .",
    "such a situation can appear for the first time at @xmath55 ( nlo ) , where @xmath56 scattering diagrams contribute . from the factorization theorem discussed above it follows that long - distance sensitive contributions",
    "may be factored into the bare parton distribution functions or fragmentation functions .",
    "the result of this procedure are finite partonic hard - scattering cross sections @xmath24 . at intermediate stages , however , the calculation will necessarily show singularities that represent the long - distance sensitivity .",
    "in addition , for those processes that are already present at lo , real @xmath56 and virtual one - loop @xmath33 diagrams contributing to the calculation will individually have infrared singularities that only cancel in their sum .",
    "virtual diagrams will also produce ultraviolet poles that need to be removed by the renormalization of the strong coupling constant at a scale @xmath29 . as a result",
    ", a regulator has to be introduced into the calculation that makes all the singularities manifest so that they can be canceled in the appropriate way .",
    "our choice will be dimensional regularization , that is , the calculation will be performed in @xmath57 space - time dimensions .",
    "subtractions of singularities will generally be made in the @xmath58 scheme .",
    "dimensional regularization becomes a somewhat subtle issue if polarizations of particles are taken into account .",
    "this is due to the fact that projections on helicities involve the dirac matrix @xmath59 for quarks and the levi - civita tensor @xmath60 for gluons .",
    "these two objects are genuinely four - dimensional and hence do not have a natural extension to @xmath61 dimensions .",
    "in fact , some care has to be taken to avoid algebraic inconsistencies in the calculation when using @xmath59 and @xmath60 . at the level of the algebra",
    "the treatment of @xmath59 and @xmath60 of course only affects terms that are of @xmath62 .",
    "however , poles proportional to @xmath63 and @xmath64 present in the calculation may combine with this to eventually result in non - vanishing contributions .",
    "a widely - used scheme for dealing with @xmath59 and @xmath60 in a fully consistent way is the one developed in  @xcite , the hvbm scheme .",
    "this is the scheme we have used for our calculation .",
    "it is mainly characterized by splitting the @xmath65-dimensional metric tensor into a four - dimensional and a @xmath66-dimensional one .",
    "the levi - civita tensor is then defined by having components within the four - dimensional subspace only , and @xmath59 anti - commutes with the other dirac matrices in the four - dimensional subspace , but commutes with them in the @xmath66-dimensional one .",
    "the hvbm scheme leads to a higher complexity of the algebra and of phase space integrals .",
    "however , one may make use of computer algebra programs such as tracer  @xcite that allow to handle the split - up of space - time , and the treatment of @xmath66-dimensional components in phase space integrals has become rather standard by now . we emphasize that for our present case the treatment of @xmath59 and @xmath60 has no bearing on the ultraviolet ( renormalization ) sector of the calculation , since we have no chiral vertices in the calculation . for instance",
    ", we may perform all renormalizations at the level of vertex and self - energy diagrams , without reference to the polarizations of the external particles .    as remarked above",
    ", we need to sum over all possible final states in each channel @xmath67 , in compliance with the requirement of single - inclusiveness of the cross section . for instance , in case of @xmath68 one needs , besides the virtual corrections to @xmath69 , three different @xmath56 reactions : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 ( where brackets indicate the unobserved parton pair ) .",
    "only all three processes combined will allow to arrive at a finite answer in the end .",
    "the summation over @xmath40 is therefore always implicitly understood in the following .",
    "in addition , the two unobserved partons in the @xmath56 contributions need to be integrated over their entire phase space .",
    "the integration may be performed in basically two different ways .",
    "the first one relies on monte - carlo integration techniques .",
    "as was shown in  @xcite , the regions where the squared @xmath56 matrix elements become singular can be straightforwardly identified and separated .",
    "these regions will yield all the poles in @xmath63 after integration , which eventually must cancel as described above .",
    "it then becomes possible to organize the calculation in such a way that the singularities are extracted and canceled by hand , while the remainder may be integrated numerically over phase space .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being very flexible ; it may be used for any infrared - safe observable , with any experimental cut  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the numerical integration involved turns out to be rather delicate and time - consuming . in case of polarized collisions ,",
    "the method was employed for the reactions @xmath73  @xcite and @xmath74  @xcite at nlo .",
    "the method we will employ is to perform the phase space integration of the @xmath56 contributions _",
    "analytically_. this has several advantages . in first place ,",
    "the final answer is much more amenable to a numerical evaluation , giving much more stable results in a much shorter time .",
    "this may become important at a later stage , when experimental data will have been obtained and one is aiming to extract @xmath15 from them within a `` global analysis ''  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the `` analytic method '' has also been employed in the unpolarized case  @xcite . since the calculation of the unpolarized and the polarized nlo terms largely proceeds along similar lines",
    ", we can compute both simultaneously .",
    "our results for the unpolarized case may then be compared at an _ analytical level _ to those available in the numerical code of  @xcite , which provides an extremely powerful check on the correctness of all our calculations .",
    "we will now separately address the virtual @xmath33 and real - emission @xmath56 nlo contributions .",
    "then we will discuss their sum and the cancellation of singularities .      at @xmath55",
    ", virtual corrections only contribute through their interference with the born diagrams , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "we have calculated the virtual contributions with two different methods .",
    "firstly , we have performed a direct calculation . here",
    "we could make use of known @xmath58-renormalized one - loop vertex and self - energy structures as given in  @xcite , which may be readily inserted into the born diagrams .",
    "one then additionally needs to calculate the box diagrams which are ultraviolet finite and hence not subject to the renormalization procedure .",
    "we have simultaneously computed the virtual corrections for the unpolarized case and found complete agreement with the results published in  @xcite .",
    "the second approach makes use of the fact that in ref .",
    "@xcite the helicity amplitudes for all one - loop @xmath33 qcd scattering diagrams were presented .",
    "it is clear that these contain the information we need for our calculation .",
    "the only subtlety is that the helicity method employed in  @xcite will not immediately yield the answer for the hvbm prescription we are looking for .",
    "however , as was also pointed out in  @xcite , the translation between the results for the two schemes is fairly straightforward .",
    "in fact , by inspecting the singularity structure of the diagrams , one can derive a universal form for the virtual contribution @xmath75 that schematically reads : @xmath76 where @xmath77 are summed over all external legs , the @xmath78 are the external parton momenta , and @xmath79 denotes the born cross section for the reaction under consideration .",
    "the @xmath80 are the so - called `` color - linked '' born cross sections , to be calculated according to rules given in  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath81 and @xmath82 are coefficients depending only on the type of external leg , with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 being the number of flavors . finally , @xmath88 is the finite remainder .",
    "the only difference between the result for the virtual correction in the helicity amplitude method and the conventional hvbm scheme resides in the @xmath79 and @xmath80 terms .",
    "for the helicity method , these are four - dimensional quantities , whereas in conventional dimensional regularization they are calculated in @xmath65 dimensions in the hvbm scheme .",
    "this property allows a direct determination of the full virtual correction in the hvbm scheme , since @xmath75 has been calculated with helicity amplitude methods in  @xcite .",
    "this strategy for determining the virtual corrections was also adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we found complete agreement between the results obtained for our two approaches for obtaining the virtual corrections .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows some representative @xmath56 feynman diagrams contributing to @xmath90 to @xmath91 .",
    "the squared spin - dependent matrix elements in @xmath65 dimensions , using the hvbm prescription for @xmath59 and the levi - civita tensor , are too lengthy to be reported here .",
    "again , we have simultaneously calculated the squared matrix elements for the unpolarized case , and we recover the known  @xcite results in @xmath65 dimensions .",
    "the polarized matrix elements can be checked in @xmath92 dimensions against the expressions in  @xcite , and again we find agreement . in @xmath57 dimensions , as a consequence of using the hvbm scheme with its distinction between four- and @xmath66-dimensional subspaces ,",
    "the squared matrix elements contain scalar products of vectors separately in these subspaces .",
    "for instance , while an outgoing unobserved parton with momentum @xmath93 is massless , @xmath94 , we may encounter its @xmath66-dimensional invariant mass , denoted as @xmath95 , in the calculation , which is constructed from the @xmath66-dimensional components of @xmath93 . such terms need to be carefully taken into account in the phase space integrations .    the most economical way of organizing the phase space integration is to work in the rest frame of the two unobserved final - state partons whose momenta @xmath96 and @xmath97 can then be parameterized as @xmath98 and to define the momenta of the other three particles to lie in the @xmath99 plane in the four - dimensional space . in this case",
    "the above @xmath95 is the only invariant arising from the @xmath66-dimensional subspace . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2k3 ] ) @xmath100 with @xmath101 , and @xmath102 denotes the unspecified @xmath103 component of @xmath96 and @xmath97 which can be trivially integrated over since the matrix element does not depend on it .",
    "one then has the three - body phase space  @xcite @xmath104 & \\times & \\int_0^{\\pi } d\\theta_1 \\sin^{1 - 2\\varepsilon } \\theta_1 \\int_0^{\\pi } d\\theta_2 \\sin^{-2\\varepsilon } \\theta_2 \\,\\frac{1}{b(\\frac{1}{2 } , -\\varepsilon)}\\int_0 ^ 1 \\frac{dx}{\\sqrt{1-x } } x^{-(1+\\varepsilon ) } \\:\\ : , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is @xmath95 normalized to its upper limit , @xmath105 .",
    "the integrations we do analytically are over @xmath7 ( for those terms in the squared matrix elements that have dependence on @xmath95 ) and the angles @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ partvar ] ) , become integration variables in the convolution with the parton densities , according to eqs .",
    "( [ eq1old ] ) and  ( [ further ] ) .",
    "extensive partial fractioning of the squared matrix elements always leads to the master integral for the angular integrations @xmath110 & = & 2\\pi \\frac{\\gamma ( 1 - 2\\varepsilon)}{\\gamma ( 1-\\varepsilon ) } 2^{-j - l}\\frac{b(1-\\varepsilon - j,1-\\varepsilon - l)}{\\gamma ( 1-\\varepsilon ) } \\ : { } _ 2 f_1 ( j , l,1-\\varepsilon;\\cos^2 \\frac{\\chi}{2 } ) \\;\\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last line is the result given in ref .",
    "@xmath111 is the euler beta function and @xmath112 denotes the hypergeometric function .",
    "the final step in the evaluation of the @xmath56 contributions is to extract the poles arising when the invariant mass of the unobserved partons becomes small : @xmath113 . according to eq .",
    "( [ partvar ] ) or the definition of @xmath114 below eq .",
    "( [ eq : k2k3 ] ) , this is the case for @xmath115 .",

    "the sum of virtual and real pieces is still singular for @xmath123 as a result of collinear divergencies .",
    "these remaining poles need to be factored into the bare parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions , depending on whether their origin was in the initial or final state .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig3 ] sketches a typical collinear situation in a @xmath56 process . the contribution displayed will require a subtraction of the form @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the spin - dependent lo @xmath126 altarelli - parisi splitting function  @xcite and @xmath127 represents the subsequent polarized lo scattering @xmath49 , evaluated in @xmath65 dimensions . more precisely , the structure of this particular collinear subtraction is @xmath128 where @xmath129 here the euler constant @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the terms that are commonplace to subtract in order to work in the @xmath58 scheme .",
    "@xmath132 is an additional finite piece in the subtraction that represents the freedom in choosing a factorization prescription and will be discussed below .",
    "we see in  ( [ subfac ] ) how the factorization scale @xmath9 emerges in the subtraction . in general",
    ", a process at nlo will require several collinear subtractions , in both the initial and the final states .",
    "depending on which types of partons are collinear , the other splitting functions @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , as well as other @xmath33 cross sections , will contribute .",
    "in the final - state collinear case , a singularity occurs when the observed parton and an unobserved one become collinear .",
    "the subtraction needed here can be easily written down in a form analogous to  ( [ subfac ] ) ; it will involve the final - state factorization scale @xmath28 .",
    "note that , since we are not considering polarization in the final state , only spin - independent splitting functions appear in the final - state factorization subtraction .    taking the @xmath58 scheme literally , one would not have any additional finite pieces in the subtraction , beyond those involving @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "that is , one would define @xmath136 in the functions @xmath137 involved in the various subtractions in the polarized and unpolarized cases . however , there is a well - known  @xcite subtlety arising in the @xmath126 splitting in the polarized case that is related to the use of the hvbm scheme .",
    "it is a property of the hvbm - scheme definition of @xmath59 that it leads to helicity non - conservation at the @xmath138 vertex in @xmath65 dimensions .",
    "this can be seen from the non - vanishing difference of unpolarized and polarized @xmath65-dimensional lo quark - to - quark splitting functions : @xmath139    a disagreeable consequence of this is a non - zero first moment ( @xmath7-integral ) of the flavor non - singlet nlo anomalous dimension for the evolution of spin - dependent quark densities , in conflict with the conservation of flavor non - singlet axial currents  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore advisable  albeit not mandatory in a purely mathematical sense  to slightly deviate from the @xmath58 scheme in the polarized case by choosing  @xcite @xmath140 it is important to point out that the choice of the function @xmath132 corresponds to the freedom in defining a factorization scheme . of course",
    ", a physical quantity like the pion production cross section must not depend on the convention regarding which finite terms are subtracted from the partonic cross sections along with the collinear poles . indeed , the parton distributions functions are scheme dependent as well , so that at any given order in @xmath30 the scheme dependence cancels in the physical observable . the factorization scheme defined by the choice",
    "( [ fqq ] ) has also been used in the available sets of spin - dependent nlo @xmath141 parton densities , so our definition is consistent with these densities . since the hvbm `` @xmath59-effect '' mentioned above",
    "is to be regarded as an artifact of the prescription and may be removed in a straightforward way by exploiting the conservation of non - singlet axial currents , results of polarized nlo calculations are usually regarded as being `` genuinely '' in the conventional @xmath58 scheme only _ with _ the choice  ( [ fqq ] ) .",
    "all other possible @xmath142 are , however , set to zero , as in the usual @xmath58 scheme .",

    "our results for the spin - dependent nlo corrections may for each of the 16 subprocesses be cast into the following form : @xmath144 & & + \\left ( a_1   \\delta ( 1-w ) +    b_1 \\frac{1}{(1-w)_+ } +   c_1 \\right ) \\ln \\frac{\\mu_f'^2}{s } + a_2 \\delta ( 1-w ) \\ln \\frac{\\mu_r^2}{s }   \\nonumber \\\\[3 mm ] & & + a \\delta ( 1-w )   + b \\frac{1}{(1-w)_+ } +   c + d\\left ( \\frac{\\ln ( 1-w)}{1-w } \\right)_+ + e \\ln w + f \\ln v \\nonumber   \\\\[3 mm ] & & + g \\ln ( 1-v ) + h \\ln(1-w )   + i   \\ln ( 1-vw)+ j   \\ln ( 1-v+vw )   \\nonumber \\\\[3 mm ] & & \\left.+k \\frac{\\ln w}{1-w } + l \\frac{\\ln \\frac{1-v}{1-vw}}{1-w }   + m \\frac{\\ln ( 1-v+vw)}{1-w }   \\right ] \\:\\:\\ : , \\label{final}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where all coefficients are functions of @xmath108 and @xmath109 , except those multiplying the distributions @xmath47 , @xmath145 , @xmath146_+$ ] which may be written as functions just of @xmath108 .",
    "terms with distributions are present only for those subprocesses that already contribute at the born level , see eq .",
    "( [ loproc ] ) .",
    "we finally make a few observations about our results for the polarized case .",
    "consider , for example , the subprocess @xmath147 in eq .",
    "( [ loproc ] ) .",
    "all feynman diagrams contributing to this cross section at nlo , virtual as well as real , are annihilation diagrams , meaning that the initial quark and antiquark legs are part of the same fermion line . independently of the number of gluons attaching to the fermion line , helicity conservation in qcd demands",
    "that the annihilation can only occur if the quark and antiquark have opposite helicities . keeping in mind the definition  ( [ eq3 ] ) for the polarized cross section , we are led to the expectation that @xmath148 should be fulfilled for this process .",
    "the only way in which this relation could be broken is if the regularization we adopt in the nlo calculation does not respect helicity conservation .",
    "as we discussed earlier , the hvbm prescription for @xmath59 indeed has this deficiency .",
    "however , as known from  @xcite , the additional finite term @xmath149  ( [ fqq ] ) in the factorization subtraction  ( [ subfac ] ) is precisely designed to cure this shortcoming of the hvbm prescription and to restore helicity conservation .",
    "this is probably the most tangible reason why the choice eq .",
    "( [ fqq ] ) is required from a physical point of view .",
    "the implication of this is that our final results for @xmath147 should indeed satisfy  ( [ helcon ] ) , which we have verified .",
    "we can actually go one step further : the channels @xmath150 and @xmath151 have contributions from annihilation diagrams as well , but also ones from non - annihilation diagrams , for which the @xmath152 and @xmath153 scatter via @xmath154-channel gluon exchange .",
    "helicity conservation makes no immediate statement about the non - annihilation diagrams .",
    "however , the channels @xmath155 and @xmath156 are described by the non - annihilation diagrams _",
    "alone_. if we subtract the corresponding cross sections from the ones for @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively , we can use helicity conservation again for the remainder .",
    "explicitly , we expect : @xmath157\\equiv - \\left [ d   \\hat{\\sigma}_{q\\bar{q}}^{q,(1 ) } -   d   \\hat{\\sigma}_{q\\bar{q}'}^{q,(1 ) } \\right ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] and similarly for an observed gluon .",
    "again we have verified that our final results obey this relation , which we consider a very powerful check on the correctness of our results .",
    "in this section , we present a first numerical application of our analytical results . instead of presenting a full - fledged phenomenological study of single - inclusive hadron production in polarized @xmath1 collisions , which we leave for a future study , we only report the main features of the nlo corrections and describe their impact on the cross sections and the spin asymmetry @xmath158 . predictions for @xmath158 are in immediate demand for an extraction of @xmath15 at rhic in the very near future .    for our calculations",
    "we assume the same kinematic coverage as in the recent phenix measurement of the unpolarized cross section at @xmath159  @xcite , that is , we consider pion transverse momenta in the range @xmath160 gev and pseudorapidities @xmath161 .",
    "we also take into account that the pion measurement is at present possible only over half the azimuthal angle .",
    "we will evaluate cross sections and spin asymmetries at both lo and nlo , in order to study the size and importance of the corrections we have calculated .",
    "we will always perform the nlo ( lo ) calculations using nlo ( lo ) parton distribution functions , fragmentation functions , and the two - loop ( one - loop ) expression for @xmath30 . to calculate the nlo ( lo ) unpolarized pion cross section needed for the denominator of the spin asymmetry @xmath158 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : asydef ] ) , we use the cteq5 m ( cteq5l )  @xcite parton distribution functions . in all our calculations we use the pion fragmentation functions of ref .",
    "@xcite , which provides both a lo and a nlo set . for the polarized cross section",
    ", we will mainly use the ( nlo / lo ) `` standard '' sets of the spin - dependent grsv  @xcite parton distributions ( `` grsv - std '' ) .",
    "since we also want to investigate the sensitivity of @xmath158 to the polarized gluon density @xmath15 , we use another set of grsv distributions , for which the gluon is assumed to be particularly large ( `` grsv - max '' ) .",
    "we note that the value of the strong coupling @xmath30 to be used in conjunction with the unpolarized parton distributions differs from that employed in the fits for the polarized sets and the fragmentation functions",
    ". our convention will be to calculate the cross sections always with the strong coupling constant accompanying the parton distributions used .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows our results for the unpolarized and polarized cross sections at nlo and lo , where we have chosen the scales @xmath162 .",
    "the lower part of the figure displays the `` @xmath163-factor '' @xmath164 one can see that in the unpolarized case the corrections are roughly constant and about @xmath165 over the @xmath0 region considered . in the polarized case , we find generally smaller corrections which become of similar size as those for the unpolarized case only at the high-@xmath0 end .",
    "the cross section for @xmath0 values smaller than about 2 gev is outside the domain of perturbative calculations as indicated by rapidly increasing nlo corrections and , therefore , is not considered here .    as we have mentioned in the introduction , one reason why nlo corrections are generally important",
    "is that they should considerably reduce the dependence of the cross sections on the unphysical factorization and renormalization scales . in this sense ,",
    "the @xmath163-factor is actually a quantity of limited significance since it is likely to be rather scale dependent through the presence of the lo cross section in its denominator .",
    "the improvement in scale dependence when going from lo to nlo is , therefore , a better measure of the impact of the nlo corrections , and , perhaps , provides also a rough estimate of the relevance of even higher order qcd corrections .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the scale dependence of the spin - dependent cross section at lo and nlo . in each case",
    "the shaded bands indicate the uncertainties from varying the unphysical scales in the range @xmath166 .",
    "the solid lines are for the choice where all scales are set to @xmath0 .",
    "one can see that the scale dependence indeed becomes much smaller at nlo .",
    "finally , we consider the spin asymmetry which is the main quantity of interest here . figure  [ fig6 ] shows @xmath158 , calculated at nlo ( solid lines ) for the `` standard '' set of grsv parton distributions , and for the one with `` maximal '' gluon polarization  @xcite .",
    "we have again chosen all scales to be @xmath0 .",
    "for comparison , we also show the lo result for the grsv `` standard '' set ( dashed line ) . as expected from the larger @xmath163 factor for the unpolarized cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the asymmetry is somewhat smaller at nlo than at lo , showing that inclusion of nlo qcd corrections is rather important for the analysis of the data in terms of @xmath15 .",
    "we also conclude from the figure that there are excellent prospects for determining @xmath167 from @xmath158 measurements at rhic : the asymmetries found for the two different sets of polarized parton densities , which mainly differ in the gluon density , show marked differences , much larger than the expected statistical errors in the experiment , indicated in the figure .",
    "the latter may be estimated by the formula @xmath168 where @xmath169 is the polarization of one beam , @xmath170 the integrated luminosity of the collisions , and @xmath171 the unpolarized cross section integrated over the @xmath0-bin for which the error is to be determined .",
    "we have used the very moderate values @xmath172 and @xmath173/pb , which are targets for the coming run .",
    "as mentioned above , we also take into account that at present with the phenix experiment a pion measurement is possible only over half the azimuthal angle .",
    "we have presented in this paper the complete nlo qcd corrections for the partonic hard - scattering cross sections relevant for the spin asymmetry @xmath2 for high-@xmath0 pion production in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "this asymmetry is a promising tool to determine the spin - dependent gluon density in the nucleon and will be measured in the coming run with polarized protons at rhic .",
    "our calculation is based on a largely analytical evaluation of the nlo partonic cross sections .",
    "we found that the nlo corrections to the polarized cross section are somewhat smaller for rhic than those in the unpolarized case .",
    "the polarized cross section shows a significant reduction of scale dependence when going from lo to nlo .",
    "upcoming rhic data should be able to provide first information on @xmath15 even for rather moderate integrated luminosities .",
    "while nearing completion of our work , we learned that d.  de florian has performed  @xcite the same calculation , using the `` monte - carlo '' method outlined in sec .",
    "2 . this provides an extremely welcome opportunity for comparing the results .",
