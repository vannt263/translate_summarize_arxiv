    "ever since the first formulation of their concept by frenkel  @xcite , peierls  @xcite , and wannier  @xcite in the 1930s , and their experimental discovery in cuprous oxide @xmath0 by gross and karryjew in 1952  @xcite , excitons are of large physical interest , because they are the quanta of the fundamental optical excitations in both insulators and semiconductors in the visible and ultraviolet spectrum of light .",
    "excitons are so - called quasi - particles being composed of an electron and a positivley charged hole .",
    "wannier excitons extend over many unit cells of the crystal and can be treated within a very simple approach as an analogue of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation , which describes these excitons , is the so - called wannier equation  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the hydrogen - like series could be observed experimentally for the so - called yellow exciton in @xmath1 for the first time up to a large principal quantum number of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this detection has brought new interest to the field of excitons  @xcite . however , the line widths detected in ref .",
    "@xcite differ from earlier theoretical calculations on this topic  @xcite , which leads us to a new investigation of the main parameters describing the shape of the excitonic absorption lines .",
    "the main features , which make @xmath1 one of the most investigated semiconductors relating to excitons , are the large excitonic binding energy of @xmath4  @xcite and the non - degeneracy of its uppermost valence band justifying the simple - band model with a hydrogen - like exciton spectrum @xmath5 besides the band gap energy @xmath6 , we also include the energy due to a finite momentum @xmath7 of the center of mass . by @xmath8",
    "we denote the mass of the exciton in effective - mass approximation . beyond the simple - band model ,",
    "one often has to account for a variety of further effects of the solid .",
    "possible corrections of this model include , e.g. , central - cell corrections  @xcite , a coupling of the uppermost valence band to other valence bands  @xcite , and especially the interaction with phonons , which are the quasi - particles of lattice vibrations .",
    "this interaction is , besides the effect of impurities in the crystal , the main cause for an asymmetric broadening and shifting of the excitonic lines observed in absorption spectra  @xcite .",
    "the general theory for the effect of phonons on excitonic spectra has been developed by toyozawa in the late 1950s and early 1960s  @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will apply the formulas of toyozawa to the yellow @xmath9-excitons considering several corrections .",
    "this allows us to calculate the observed line widths within the same order of magnitude when compared to the experiment  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec:23 ] we present the main results of toyozawa s theory . finally , we give a short summary and outlook in sec .",

    "we will not present the complete theory of exciton - phonon coupling here , but only present the main results of toyozawa s theory .",

    "@xcite .    in general , the exciton couples to two different kinds of phonons : to longitudinal acoustic phonons ( la ) via deformation",
    "potential coupling  @xcite and to longitudinal optical phonons ( lo ) via the frhlich interaction  @xcite . for both interactions",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is of the same form in second quantization @xmath10 by @xmath11 we denote the operators annihilating ( creating ) a phonon in the mode @xmath12 .",
    "the operators @xmath13 annihilate ( create ) excitons with momentum @xmath7 in the state @xmath14 . since we make use of the simple hydrogen - like model , we treat the quantum numbers @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 as known from atomic physics as good quantum numbers ; although this is generally not the case due to the cubic symmetry of the solid  @xcite",

    "these matrix elements include the mass density @xmath25 and volume @xmath26 of the solid , the deformation coupling potentials @xmath27 of conduction band and valence band , the dielectric constants above @xmath28 and below @xmath29 the optical resonance as well as the effective charges as defined by toyozawa  @xcite :    @xmath30    by @xmath31 we denote the effective masses of electron and hole .",
    "the interaction with phonons leads to peaks of asymmetric loretzian shape in the absorption spectrum .",
    "the absorption coefficient depending on the frequency of light is given by  @xcite    @xmath32}{\\left[\\hbar\\omega-\\tilde{e}_{\\nu\\boldsymbol{0 } } \\left(\\omega\\right)\\right]^{2}+\\left[\\hbar\\tilde{\\gamma}_{\\nu\\boldsymbol{0 } } \\left(\\omega\\right)\\right]^{2}}\\label{eq : alpha}\\ ] ]    with the energy shift @xmath33 the line broadening @xmath34 the scaling of the constant amplitude @xmath35 @xmath36 and the asymmetry @xmath37 , which can be calculated from @xmath38    the quantity @xmath39 denotes the transition matrix element between the ground state @xmath40 of the solid and the exciton state @xmath41 with @xmath42 due to the electron - photon interaction . in cuprous oxide",
    "the transition is parity - forbidden , which results in  @xcite @xmath43 since in both equations  ( [ eq : f ] ) and  ( [ eq : a ] ) @xmath39 appears quadratically , the asymmetry @xmath37 will be independent of the proportionality constant @xmath44 .",

    "in the following we will discuss the different contributions to the line widths @xmath53 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) for @xmath1 at the very low temperature of @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "the relevant material parameters are listed in table [ tab : material - parameters - of ] .",
    "although the unit cell of @xmath1 comprises @xmath55 atoms , which amounts in @xmath56 optical phonon modes , there are only two lo - phonon modes with @xmath57-symmetry contributing to the frhlich interaction  @xcite .",

    "@xcite unless otherwise stated .",
    "[ tab : material - parameters - of ] [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      in the above calculation we made some assumptions , which are discussed in the following .",
    "we also discuss possible causes for a further broadening of the lines , which may be difficult to be considered in theory .    we have assumed that the dispersion of la phonons is linear according to @xmath59 and that the dispersion of lo phonons is constant . if we perform the @xmath60-integration according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : intq ] ) only up to a value of @xmath61 , our results do not change for @xmath62 , i.e. , we can always set the upper boundary of the integral to @xmath63 .",
    "since the assumption of the la dispersion relation to be linear in @xmath60 holds for @xmath64  @xcite , its usage is retroactively justified .",
    "furthermore , the change of the energy of the lo phonons within this limit is very small  @xcite .",
    "we have treated @xmath16 and @xmath17 as good quantum numbers in the above calculations .",
    "this is in general not the case due to the cubic symmetry of the crystal .",
    "nevertheless , since @xmath65 is the point group with the highest symmetry , it may be justified to treat @xmath16 approximatively as a good quantum number  @xcite .",
    "however , one would still have to calculate the correct linear combinations of states with different @xmath17 quantum number , which then transform according to the irreducible representations of the cubic group @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "this has not been done since we expect no effect from this rearrangement of states .",
    "the rydberg energies @xmath66 of excitonic spectra are generally obtained from fits to experimental results .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath66 for the yellow series of @xmath1 varies between @xmath67  @xcite and @xmath68  @xcite in the literature .",
    "the same argument holds for the band gap energy @xmath6 .",
    "one reason for the deviations in the line positions in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison - of - the ] is thus the uncertainity in these constants .",
    "we have also assumed that the simple band model holds .",
    "indeed , the results in  @xcite show that this approximation is reasonable ; but one could also include the complete valence band structure in the theory  @xcite .",
    "this makes an investigation of line widths almost impossible since the energies @xmath69 have to be determined first of all , and a separation of relative motion and the motion of the center of mass is not possible  @xcite .",
    "the calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite on the line widths of the @xmath2-exciton states of different semiconductors already show the main problems if one would have to extend the theory to principal quantum numbers of @xmath70 . on the other hand , an inclusion of the complete valence band structure results in a coupling of the yellow and green exciton series , especially to the green @xmath2-exciton state  @xcite .",
    "since we found out that the yellow @xmath2-exciton state has a significant influence on the line width of the @xmath71-exciton state , we expect that the coupling to the green @xmath2-exciton state will lead to a further broadening of this line .",
    "the coupling to the ( energetically higher located ) green series may also be a reason for the large degree of asymmetry of the lines .",
    "the complex valence band structure is sometimes treated in a simple approach in terms of quantum defects  @xcite . however , the results of ref .",
    "@xcite show that this approach works well only at high quantum numbers @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , we did not consider quantum defects in our calculations .",
    "the complex valence band structure also facilitates a coupling of excitons to ta phonons  @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of ta phonons is reported to be half as large as the effect of la phonons  @xcite , which is already very small in our case .",
    "the coupling to ta phonons may be more important if external strains are applied to the crystal  @xcite .",
    "impurities , especially point defects , in the crystal can lead to a broadening of exciton line widths  @xcite .",
    "the effect of an increase in the defect concentration has , according to toyozawa  @xcite , the same effect as a raising of the temperature .",
    "however , it has been discussed in the literature that a large concentration of impurities will lead to a more gaussian or voigt line shape  @xcite .",
    "this can not be seen in the line spectrum measured in ref .",
    "@xcite , for which reason we have to assume that the concentration of defects is low .",
    "certainly , one could also estimate the concentration of defects experimentally by an extrapolation of the line width to @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the effect of a movement of defects being caused by phonons is said to be negligible  @xcite .",
    "the frhlich coupling constant is defined as  @xcite @xmath74 for @xmath1 we obtain @xmath75 and @xmath76 . since these values are clearly smaller than @xmath77 , we can neglect polaron corrections to the energy and the mass of the excitons  @xcite .    in the unit cell of @xmath1",
    "there are always four copper atoms arranged in tetragonal symmetry  @xcite , but only in every second tetragon an oxygen atom is located at its center . since the oxygen atoms are very small , there is a chance that there are sometimes more than two oxygen atom in one unit cell .",
    "the excess atoms will then occupy the free positions in the lattice and act as acceptors .",
    "this results in small charges and in small internal electric fields , which will influence the exciton and lead to a line broadening .",
    "however , it is hard to account for these fields in theory .",
    "the coupling between excitons and phonons is linear , i.e. , there is always only one phonon being involved in a scattering process . in the literature , multi - phonon processes are said to be important in connection with piezoelectric coupling  @xcite .",
    "sometimes , they are even said to be negligible  @xcite .    in general",
    ", there are no excitons in crystals but polaritons due to the coupling to light  @xcite . in other materials than @xmath1 the excitonic @xmath2-ground state is often dipole allowed .",
    "the resulting large polariton coupling mainly changes the contribution of la phonons to the line widths but the contribution of the lo phonons only weakly  ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and further references therein ) .",
    "since the la - phononic contribution is small for @xmath1 , we expect that the polariton effect will not change our results significantly , so that it can even be neglected  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the central - cell corrections have a major influence on the line width of the @xmath71-exciton state .",
    "besides the central - cell corrections , which lead to an increase in the mass of the @xmath2-exciton , there exists also a @xmath78-dependent exchange interaction , which results in a @xmath78-dependent effective mass @xmath79 of this exciton  @xcite .",
    "we expect the influence of the @xmath78-dependency of the mass @xmath80 to be small for the following reason : we have proven that the effect of interband coupling on the line width is unimportant . for this reason the main contribution to the line widths comes from the region with @xmath81 and it is sufficient to take the value @xmath82  ( cf . the illustrations of intraband and interband scattering in ref .",
    "we have calculated the main parameters describing the shape of the excitonic absorption lines for the yellow exciton series of @xmath1 and compared our results to the experimentally observed lines of ref .",
    "especially the calculated line width for yellow @xmath71-exciton lies within the same order of magnitude as the experimental one and differs only by a factor of  @xmath83 , which is a significant improvement on the result of ref .",
    "furthermore , we have discussed possible reasons for the large broadening and the large asymmetry of the lines . of course , some of these special properties of @xmath1 could eventually be included in theory , but only with huge effort .    recently , it has been shown that the yellow excitonic line spectrum of @xmath1 in an external magnetic field shows gue statistics  @xcite .",
    "this line statistics has been explained in terms of the exciton - phonon coupling in the crystal .",
    "therefore , it will be worthwhile to extend our calculations by including a magnetic field in order to prove the gue statistics theoretically .",
    "we thank ch .",
    "uihlein and d.  frhlich for helpful discussions .",
    "due to periodic boundary conditions , the values of the phononic wave vector @xmath84 are generally discrete  @xcite .",
    "if we apply the continuum approximation , in which the number of atoms @xmath85 of the solid goes to infinity and the lattice constant @xmath86 between the atoms goes to zero while the ratio @xmath87 is kept constant , we can treat @xmath84 as a continuous quantity and replace the corresponding sums by integrals :        the upper boundary @xmath90 of the @xmath60-integral is given by the boundary of the first brillouin zone ( bz ) and can be calculated from the debye model  @xcite . to this end",
    "we substitute the variable @xmath91 in the integrals of eqs .",

    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) and  ( [ eq : delta ] ) as functions of @xmath60 and use the relation @xmath117 where the sum is over all roots @xmath118 of @xmath119 .",
