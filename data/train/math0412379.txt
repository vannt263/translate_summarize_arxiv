    "time - reversal techniques have attracted great attention recently due to the large variety of interesting potential applications .",
    "the basic idea of time - reversal ( often also referred to as phase - conjugation in the frequency domain ) can be roughly described as follows : a localized source emits a short pulse of acoustic , electromagnetic or elastic energy which propagates through a richly scattering environment .",
    "a receiver array records the arriving waves , typically as a long and complicated signal due to the complexity of the environment , and stores the time - series of measured signals in memory . after a short while",
    ", the receiver array sends the recorded signals time - reversed ( i.e. first in - last out ) back into the same medium . due to the time - reversibility of the wave fields , the emitted energy backpropagates through the same environment , practically retracing the paths of the original signal , and refocuses , again as a short pulse , on the location where the source emitted the original pulse .",
    "this , certainly , is a slightly oversimplified description of the rather complex physics which is involved in the real time - reversal experiment . in practice ,",
    "the quality of the refocused pulse depends on many parameters , as for example the randomness of the background medium , the size and location of the receiver array , temporal fluctuations of the environment , etc .",
    "surprisingly , the quality of the refocused signal increases with increasing complexity of the background environment .",
    "this was observed experimentally by m. fink and his group at the laboratoire ondes et acoustique at universit paris vii in paris by a series of laboratory experiments ( see for example @xcite ) , and by w.  a.  kuperman and co - workers at the scripps institution of oceanography at university of california , san diego , by a series of experiments performed between 1996 and 2000 in a shallow ocean environment ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the list of possible applications of this time - reversal technique is long .",
    "in an iterated fashion , resembling the power method for finding maximal eigenvalues of a square matrix , the time - reversal method can be applied for focusing energy created by an ultrasound transducer array on strongly scattering objects in the region of interest .",
    "this can be used for example in lithotripsy for localizing and destroying gall - stones in an automatic way , or more generally in the application of medical imaging problems .",
    "detection of cracks in the aeronautic industry , or of submarines in the ocean are other examples .",
    "see for example @xcite , and for related work @xcite . the general idea of time - reversibility , and its use in imaging and detection , is certainly not that new . looking into the literature for example of seismic imaging , the application of this basic idea can be found in a classical and very successful imaging strategy for detecting scattering interfaces in the earth , the so - called migration technique @xcite . however , the systematic use and investigation of the time - reversal phenomenon and its experimental realizations started more recently , and has been carried out during the last 1015 years or so by different research groups .",
    "see for example @xcite for experimental demonstrations , and @xcite for theoretical and numerical approaches .",
    "one very young and promising application of time - reversal is * communication*. in this paper we will mainly concentrate on that application , although the general results should carry over also to other applications as mentioned above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ tro.sec ]",
    "we give a very short introduction into time - reversal in the ocean , with a special emphasis on underwater sound communication .",
    "wireless communication in a mimo setup , our second main application in this paper , is briefly presented in section [ mimo.sec ] . in section [ sym.sec ]",
    "we discuss symmetric hyperbolic systems in the form needed here , and examples of such systems are given in section [ exa.sec ] .",
    "in section [ spa.sec ] , the basic spaces and operators necessary for our mathematical treatment are introduced . the inverse problem in communication , which we are focusing on in this paper ,",
    "is then defined in section [ opt.sec ] . in section [ mat.sec ]",
    ", we derive the basic iterative scheme for solving this inverse problem .",
    "section [ adj.sec ] gives practical expressions for calculating the adjoint communication operator , which plays a key role in the iterative time - reversal schemes presented in this paper . in section [ atrm.sec ] the acoustic time - reversal mirror",
    "is defined , which will provide the link between the acoustic time - reversal experiment and the adjoint communication operator .",
    "the analogous results for the electromagnetic time - reversal mirror are discussed in section [ etrm.sec ] .",
    "section [ tra.sec ] combines the results of these two sections , and explicitly provides the link between time - reversal and the adjoint imaging method .",
    "sections [ gmc.sec ] , [ mns.sec ] , and [ rls.sec ] propose then several different iterative time - reversal schemes for solving the inverse problem of communication , using this key relationship between time - reversal and the adjoint communication operator .",
    "the practically important issue of partial measurements ( and generalized measurements ) is treated in section [ pm.sec ] .",
    "finally , section [ sfr.sec ] summarizes the results of this paper , and points out some interesting future research directions .",
    "the ocean is a complex wave - guide for sound @xcite . in addition to scattering effects at the top and the bottom of the ocean , also its temperature profile and the corresponding refractive effects",
    "contribute to this wave - guiding property and allow acoustic energy to travel large distances .",
    "typically , this propagation has a very complicated behaviour .",
    "for example , multipathing occurs if source and receiver of sound waves are far away from each other , since due to scattering and refraction there are many possible paths on which acoustic energy can travel between them .",
    "surface waves and air bubbles at the top of the ocean , sound propagation through the rocks and sedimentary layers at the bottom of the ocean , and other effects further contribute to the complexity of sound propagation in the ocean .",
    "when a source ( e.g. the base station of a communication system in the ocean ) emits a short signal at a given location , the receiver ( e.g. a user of this communication system ) some distance away from the source typically receives a long and complicated signal due to the various influences of the ocean to this signal along the different connecting paths . if the base station wants to communicate with the user by sending a series of short signals , this complex response of the ocean to the signal needs to be resolved and taken into account .    in a classical communication system , the base station which wants to communicate with a user broadcasts a series of short signals ( e.g.  a series of zeros and ones ) into the environment",
    "the hope is that the user will receive this message as a similar series of temporally well - resolved short signals which can be easily identified and decoded .",
    "however , this almost never occurs in a complex environment , due to the multipathing and the resulting delay - spread of the emitted signals .",
    "typically , when the base station broadcasts a series of short signals into such an environment , intersymbol interference occurs at the user position due to the temporal overlap of the multipath contributions of these signals . in order to recover the individual signals ,",
    "a significant amount of signal processing is necessary at the user side , and , most importantly , the user needs to have some knowledge of the propagation behaviour of the signals in this environment ( i.e. he needs to know the channel ) .",
    "intersymbol interference can in principle be avoided by adding a sufficient delay between individual signals emitted at the base station which takes into account the delay - spread in the medium .",
    "that , however , slows down the communication , and reduces the capacity of the environment as a communication system .",
    "an additional drawback of simply broadcasting communication signals from the base station is the obvious lack of interception security .",
    "a different user who also knows the propagation behaviour of signals in the environment , can equally well resolve the series of signals arriving at his location and decode them .",
    "several approaches have been suggested to circumvent the above mentioned drawbacks of communication in multiple - scattering environments .",
    "some very promising techniques are based on the time - reversibility property of propagating wave - fields @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "the user who wants to communicate with the base station , starts the communication process by sending a short pilot signal through the environment .",
    "the base station receives this signal as a long and complex signal due to multipathing .",
    "it time - reverses the received signal and sends it back into the environment .",
    "the backpropagating waves will produce a complicated wave - field everywhere due to the many interfering parts of the emitted signal .",
    "however , due to the time - reversibility of the wave - fields , we expect that the interference will be constructive at the position of the user who sent the original pilot signal , and mainly destructive at all other positions .",
    "therefore , the user will receive at his location a short signal very similar to ( ideally , a time - reversed replica of ) the pilot signal which he sent for starting the communication .",
    "all other users who might be in the environment at the same time will only receive noise speckle due to incoherently interfering contributions of the backpropagating field .",
    "if the base station sends the individual elements ( ones and zeros ) of the intended message in a phase - encoded form as a long overlapping string of signals , the superposition principle will ensure that , at the user position , this string of signals will appear as a series of short well - separated signals , each resembling some phase - shifted ( and time - reversed ) form of the pilot signal .    in order to find out whether this theoretically predicted",
    "scenario actually takes place in a real multiple - scattering environment like the ocean , kuperman have performed a series of four experiments in a shallow ocean environment between 1996 and 2000 , essentially following the above described scenario .",
    "the experiments have been performed at a mediterranean location close to the italian coast .",
    "( a similar setup was also used in an experiment performed in 2001 off the coast of new england which has been reported in yang @xcite . ) a schematic view of these experiments is shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the single user is replaced here by a probe source , and the source - receive array ( sra ) plays the role of the base station. an additional vertical receive array ( vra ) was deployed at the position of the probe source in order to measure the temporal and spatial spread of the backpropagating fields in the neighbourhood of the probe source location . in this shallow environment ( depths of about @xmath0 m , and distances between @xmath1 and @xmath2 km )",
    "the multipathing of the waves is mostly caused by multiple reflections at the surface and the bottom of the ocean .",
    "the results of the experiments have been reported in @xcite .",
    "they show that in fact a strong spatial and temporal focusing of the backpropagating waves occurs at the source position . a theoretical explanation of the temporal and spatial refocusing of time - reversed waves in random environments has been given in blomgren @xcite .",
    "the underwater acoustics scenario described above directly carries over to situations which might be more familiar to most of us , namely to the more and more popular wireless communication networks using mainly electromagnetic waves in the microwave regime . starting from the everyday use of cell - phones , ranging to small wireless - operating local area networks ( lan ) for computer systems or for private enterprise communication systems ,",
    "exactly the same problems arise as in underwater communication .",
    "the typically employed microwaves of a wavelength at about 1030 cm are heavily scattered by environmental objects like cars , fences , trees , doors , furniture etc .",
    "this causes a very complicated multipath structure of the signals received by users of such a communication system .",
    "since bandwidths are limited and increasingly expensive , a need for more and more efficient communication systems is imminent .",
    "recently , the idea of a so - called multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) communication system has been introduced with the potential to increase the capacity and efficiency of wireless communication systems @xcite .",
    "the idea is to replace a single antenna at the base station which is responsible for multiple users , or even a system where one user communicates only with his own dedicated base antenna , by a more general system where an array of multiple antennas at the base station is interacting simultaneously and in a complex way with multiple users .",
    "a schematic description of such a mimo system ( with seven base antennas and seven users ) is given in figure [ figure2 ] .",
    "see for example @xcite for recent overviews on mimo technology .",
    "time - reversal techniques are likely to play also here a key role in improving communication procedures and for optimizing the use of the limited resources ( especially bandwidth ) which are available for this technology @xcite .",
    "one big advantage of time - reversal techniques is that they are automatically adapted to the complex environment and that they can be very fast since they do not require heavy signal processing at the receiver or user side . in @xcite , an * iterated time - reversal scheme * for the optimal refocusing of signals in such a mimo communication system",
    "was proposed , which we will describe in more details in section [ gmc.sec ] .    in the present paper",
    "we will establish a direct link between the time - reversal technique and solution strategies for inverse problems . as an application of this relationship",
    ", we will derive iterative time - reversal schemes for the optimization of wireless or underwater acoustic mimo communication systems .",
    "the derivation is performed completely in time - domain , for very general first order symmetric hyperbolic systems describing wave propagation phenomena in a complex environment .",
    "one of the schemes which we derive , in a certain sense the basic one , will turn out to be practically equivalent to the scheme introduced in @xcite , although the derivation uses different tools .",
    "therefore , it provides a new interpretation of that scheme . the other schemes which we introduce",
    "are new in this application , and can be considered as either generalizations of the basic scheme , or as independent alternatives to that scheme .",
    "each of them addresses slightly different objectives and has its own very specific characteristics .",
    "we treat wave propagation in communication systems in the general framework of symmetric hyperbolic systems of the form @xmath3 @xmath4 here , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are real - valued time - dependent @xmath7-vectors , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "@xmath10 is a real , symmetric , uniformly positive definite @xmath11-matrix , i.e. , @xmath12 for some @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , @xmath14 is a symmetric positive semi - definite @xmath11 matrix , i.e. , @xmath15 .",
    "it models possible energy loss through dissipation in the medium .",
    "the @xmath16 are real , symmetric and independent of @xmath17 .",
    "we will also use the short notation @xmath18 in addition to the above mentioned assumptions on the coefficients @xmath10 and @xmath14 , we will assume throughout this paper that all quantities @xmath10 , @xmath14 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are sufficiently regular in order to safely apply for example integration by parts and green s formulas .",
    "for details see for example @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we will assume that no energy reaches the boundaries @xmath19 during the time @xmath20 $ ] , such that we will always have @xmath21.\\ ] ] the _ energy density _",
    "@xmath22 is defined by @xmath23 the _ total energy _",
    "@xmath24 in @xmath25 at a given time @xmath26 is therefore @xmath27 the _ flux _ @xmath28 is given by @xmath29",
    "in the following , we want to give some examples for symmetric hyperbolic systems as defined above .",
    "of special interest for communication are the system of the linearized acoustic equations and the system of maxwell s equations .",
    "we will discuss these two examples in detail in this paper .",
    "another important example for symmetric hyperbolic systems is the system of elastic waves equations , which we will however leave out in our discussion for the sake of shortness .",
    "we only mention here that all the results derived here apply without restrictions also to linear elastic waves .",
    "elastic wave propagation becomes important for example in ocean acoustic communication models which incorporate wave propagation through the sedimentary and rock layers at the bottom of the ocean .      as a model for * underwater sound propagation * , we consider the following linearized form of the acoustic equations in an isotropic medium @xmath30 @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is the velocity , @xmath33 the pressure , @xmath34 the density , and @xmath35 the compressibility .",
    "we have @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 as a superscript always means transpose ) .",

    ", we will consider maxwell s equations for an anisotropic medium with some energy loss due to the inherent conductivity .",
    "this can for example model * wireless communication * in a complex environment .",
    "@xmath50 we have @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , @xmath54 here , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are symmetric positive definite @xmath57 matrices modelling the anisotropic permittivity and permeability distribution in the medium , and @xmath58 is a symmetric positive semi - definite @xmath57 matrix which models the anisotropic conductivity distribution . in wireless communication , this form can model for example dissipation by conductive trees , conductive wires , rainfall , pipes , etc .",

    "@xmath63      as already mentioned , also elastic waves can be treated in the general framework of symmetric hyperbolic systems . for more details",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "for our mathematical treatment of time - reversal we introduce the following spaces and inner products .",
    "we assume that we have @xmath64 users @xmath65 , @xmath66 in our system , and in addition a base station which consists of @xmath67 antennas @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "each user and each antenna at the base station can receive , process and emit signals which we denote by @xmath70 for a given user @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and by @xmath71 for a given base antenna @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "each of these signals consists of a time - dependent @xmath7-vector indicating measured or processed signals of time - length @xmath39 . in our analysis",
    "we will often have to consider functions defined on the time interval @xmath72 $ ] instead of @xmath20 $ ] .",

    "it will always be obvious which space we refer to in a given situation .",

    "this gives rise to a source distribution @xmath79 , @xmath66 , or @xmath80 , @xmath69 , respectively . here and",
    "in the following we will use in our notation the following convention .",
    "if one symbol appears in both forms , with and without a hat ( ^ ) on top of this symbol , then all quantities _ with _ the hat symbol are related to the users , and those _ without _ the hat symbol to the antennas at the base station .",
    "each of the sources created by a user or by a base antenna will appear on the right hand side of ( [ sym.1 ] ) as a mathematical source function and gives rise to a corresponding wave field which satisfies ( [ sym.1 ] ) , ( [ sym.2 ] ) .",
    "when solving the system ( [ sym.1 ] ) , ( [ sym.2 ] ) , typically certain sobolev spaces need to be employed for the appropriate description of the underlying function spaces ( see for example @xcite ) . for our purposes",
    ", however , it will be sufficient to assume that both , source functions and wave fields , are members of the following canonical function space @xmath81 which is defined as @xmath82)^{n}\\,,\\,{{\\bf u}}=0\\ ; \\mbox{on}\\;\\partial \\omega\\times [ 0,t]\\,,\\,\\;\\|{{\\bf u}}\\|_{u}<\\infty\\},\\ ] ] and which we have equipped with the usual energy inner product @xmath83}\\int_{\\omega}\\left\\langle\\gamma({{\\bf x}}){{\\bf u}}({{\\bf x}},t ) , { { \\bf v}}({{\\bf x}},t)\\right\\rangle_n\\,d{{\\bf x}}dt,\\ ] ] and the corresponding energy norm @xmath84 also here , in order to simplify the notation , we will use the same space when considering functions in the shifted time interval @xmath72 $ ] instead of @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "typically , when a user or an antenna at the base station transforms a signal into a source distribution , it is done according to a very specific antenna characteristic which takes into account the spatial extension of the user or the antenna .",
    "we will model this characteristic at the user by the functions @xmath85 , @xmath66 , and for base antennas by the functions @xmath86 , @xmath69 . with these functions",
    ", we can introduce the linear source operators @xmath87 and @xmath88 mapping signals @xmath89 at the set of users and @xmath90 at the set of base antennas into the corresponding source distributions @xmath91 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "they are given as @xmath92 we will assume that the functions @xmath85 are supported on a small neighbourhood @xmath93 of the user location @xmath94 , and that the functions @xmath86 are supported on a small neighbourhood @xmath95 of the antenna location @xmath96 . moreover , all these neighbourhoods are strictly disjoint to each other . for example",
    ", the functions @xmath85 could be assumed to be @xmath97-approximations of the dirac delta measure @xmath98 concentrated at the user locations @xmath94 , and the functions @xmath86 could be assumed to be @xmath97-approximations of the dirac delta measure @xmath99 concentrated at the antenna locations @xmath96 .",
    "both , users and base antennas can also record incoming fields @xmath100 and transform the recorded information into signals .",
    "also here , this is usually done according to very specific antenna characteristics of each user and each base antenna . for simplicity",
    "( and without loss of generality ) , we will assume that the antenna characteristic of a user or base antenna for receiving signals is the same as for transmitting signals , namely @xmath85 for the user and @xmath86 for a base antenna .",
    "( the case of more general source and measurement operators is discussed in section [ pm.sec ] . ) with this , we can define the linear measurement operators @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively , which transform incoming fields into measured signals , by @xmath103 finally , we define the linear operator @xmath104 mapping sources @xmath105 to states @xmath106 by @xmath107 where @xmath106 solves the problem ( [ sym.1 ] ) , ( [ sym.2 ] ) . as already mentioned , we assume that the domain @xmath25 is chosen sufficiently large and that the boundary @xmath108 is sufficiently far away from the users and base antennas , such that there is no energy reaching the boundary in the time interval @xmath20 $ ] ( or @xmath72 $ ] ) due to the finite speed of signal propagation . therefore , the operator @xmath104 is well - defined .",
    "formally , we can now introduce the two linear * communication operators * @xmath109 and @xmath110 which are at the main focus of this paper .",
    "they are defined as @xmath111 the operator @xmath109 models the following situation .",
    "the base station emits the signal @xmath112 which propagates through the complex environment . the users measure the arriving wave fields and transform them into measurement signals",
    "the measured signals at the set of all users is @xmath113 .",
    "the operator @xmath110 describes exactly the reversed situation .",
    "all users emit together the set of signals @xmath114 , which propagate through the given complex environment and are received by the base station .",
    "the corresponding set of measured signals at all antennas of the base station is just @xmath115 .",
    "no time - reversal is involved so far .",
    "in the following , we outline a typical problem arising in communication , which gives rise to a mathematically well - defined inverse problem .",
    "a specified user of the system , say @xmath116 , defines a ( typically but not necessarily short ) pilot signal @xmath117 which he wants to use as a template for receiving the information from the base station .",
    "the base station wants to emit a signal @xmath118 which , after having travelled through the complex environment and arriving at the user @xmath116 , matches this pilot signal as closely as possible .",
    "neither the base station nor any other user except of @xmath116 are required ( or expected ) to know the correct form of the pilot signal @xmath117 for this problem . as an additional constraint",
    ", the base station wants that at the other users @xmath65 , @xmath119 , as little energy as possible arrives when communicating with the specified user @xmath116 .",
    "this is also in the interest of the other users , who want to use a different channel for communicating at the same time with the base antenna , and want to minimize interference with the communication initiated by user @xmath116 .",
    "the complex environment itself in which the communication takes place ( i.e. the channel ) is assumed to be unknown to all users and to the base station .    in order to arrive at a mathematical description of this problem",
    ", we define the ideal signal @xmath120 received by all users as @xmath121 each user only knows his own component of this signal , and the base antenna does not need to know any component of this ideal signal at all .    * the inverse problem of communication*:in the terminology of inverse problems , the above described scenario defines an inverse source problem , which we call for the purpose of this paper the inverse problem of communication. the goal is to find a source distribution @xmath122 at the base station which satisfies the data @xmath123 at the users : @xmath124 the state equation relating sources to data is given by the symmetric hyperbolic system ( [ sym.1 ] ) , ( [ sym.2 ] ) .",
    "notice that the basic operator @xmath109 in ( [ opt.2 ] ) is unknown to us since we do not know the complicated medium in which the waves propagate .",
    "if the operator @xmath109 ( together with @xmath125 ) would be known at the base station by some means , the inverse source problem formulated above could be solved using classical inverse problems techniques , which would be computationally expensive but in principle doable . in our situation",
    ", we are able to do physical experiments , which amounts to applying the communication operator @xmath109 to a given signal .",
    "determining the operator @xmath109 explicitly by applying it to a set of basis functions of @xmath75 would be possible , but again too expensive .",
    "we will show in the following that , nevertheless , many of the classical solution schemes known from inverse problems theory can be applied in our situation even without knowing this operator .",
    "the basic tool which we will use is a series of time - reversal experiments , applied to carefully designed signals at the users and the base station .",
    "a practical template for an * iterative scheme for finding an optimal signal * at the base station can be envisioned as follows .",
    "user @xmath116 starts the communication process by emitting an initial signal @xmath126 into the complex environment .",
    "this signal , after having propagated through the complex environment , finally arrives at the base station and is received there usually as a relatively long and complicated signal due to the multiple scattering events it experienced on its way .",
    "when the base station receives such a signal , it processes it and sends a new signal @xmath127 back through the environment which is received by all users . after receiving this signal , all",
    "users become active .",
    "the user @xmath116 compares the received signal with the pilot signal .",
    "if the match is not good enough , it processes the received signal in order to optimize the match with the pilot signal when receiving the next iterate from the base station .",
    "all other users identify the received signal as unwanted noise , and process it with the goal to receive in the next iterate from the base station a signal with lower amplitude , such that it does not interfere with their own communications .",
    "all users send now their processed signals , which together define @xmath128 , back to the base station .",
    "the base station receives them all at the same time , again usually as a long and complicated signal , processes this signal and sends a new signal",
    "@xmath129 back into the environment which ideally will match the desired signals at all users better than the previously emitted signal @xmath127 .",
    "this iteration stops when all users are satisfied , i.e. , when user @xmath116 receives a signal which is sufficiently close to the pilot signal @xmath117 , and the energy or amplitude of the signals arriving at the other users has decreased enough in order not to disturb their own communications . after this learning process of the channel has been completed , the user @xmath116 can now start communicating safely with the base antenna using the chosen pilot signal @xmath117 for decoding the received signals .",
    "similar schemes have been suggested in @xcite in a single - step fashion , and in @xcite performing multiple steps of the iteration .",

    "alternatively , a fixed iteration number @xmath137 can be specified a - priori for stopping the iteration .",
    "needless to say that , in practical implementations , the laboratory time needs to be reset to zero after each time - reversal step .",
    "the experimental procedure which is described above is practically equivalent to the experimental procedure which was suggested and experimentally verified in @xcite .",
    "therefore , our basic scheme provides an alternative derivation and interpretation of this experimental procedure .",
    "we mention that several refinements of this scheme are possible and straightforward .",
    "for example , a weighted inner product can be introduced for the user signal space @xmath76 which puts different preferences on the satisfaction of the user objectives during the iterative optimization process .",
    "for example , if the importance of suppressing interferences with other users is valued higher than to get an optimal signal quality at the specified user @xmath116 , a higher weight can be put into the inner product at those users which did not start the communication process . a user who does not care about these interferences , simply puts a very small weight into his component of the inner product of @xmath76 .",
    "notice that there is no mechanism directly built into this procedure which prevents the energy emitted by the base antenna to increase more than the communication system can support .",
    "for example , if the subspace of signals @xmath261 is not empty , then it might happen that during the iteration described above ( e.g. due to noise ) an increasing amount of energy is put into signals emitted by the base station which are in this subspace and which all produce zero contributions to the measurements at all users .",
    "more generally , elements of the subspace of signals @xmath262 for a very small threshold @xmath263 , might cause problems during the iteration if the pilot signal @xmath120 chosen by the user has contributions in the subspace @xmath264 ( i.e. in the space of all @xmath265 with @xmath266 ) .",
    "this is so because in the effort of decreasing the mismatch between @xmath267 and @xmath120 , the base antenna might need to put signals with high energy into the system in order to get only small improvements in the signal match at the user side . since the environment ( and therefore the operator @xmath109 ) is unknown a - priori , it is difficult to avoid the existence of such contributions in the pilot signal .",
    "one possible way to prevent the energy emitted by the base station to increase artificially would be to project the signals @xmath268 onto the orthogonal complements of the subspaces @xmath269 or @xmath270 ( if they are known or can be constructed by some means ) prior to their emission .",
    "alternatively , the iteration can be stopped at an early stage before these unwanted contributions start to build up .",
    "( this in fact has been suggested in @xcite ) .    in the following subsection",
    "we introduce an alternative way of ensuring that the energy emitted by the base station stays reasonably bounded in the effort of fitting the pilot signal at the users .",
    "consider the regularized problem @xmath271 with some suitably chosen regularization parameter @xmath272 . in this problem formulation a trade - off is sought between a signal fit at the user side and a minimized energy emission at the base station .",
    "the trade - off parameter is the regularization parameter @xmath273 .",
    "instead of ( [ mat.3 ] ) we need to consider now @xmath274 the negative gradient direction is now given by @xmath275 , such that the regularized iteration reads : @xmath276 where we have replaced @xmath142 by @xmath247 .",
    "the time - reversal iteration can be expanded into the following practical scheme @xmath277 comparing with ( [ gmc.2 ] ) , we see that the adaptations which need to be applied in the practical implementation for stabilizing the basic algorithm can easily be done .",
