    "recent and planned experiments on @xmath0-scattering  @xcite as well as reactions with the deuteron and light nuclei reach large momentum transfer from the probe particle to the investigated system . in this context ,",
    "relativistic effects play an essential role in understanding reaction mechanisms .",
    "studies of elastic electron - deuteron scattering ( see , for example , @xcite ) in the nonrelativistic framework require to take into account mesonic exchange currents ( a part of them has a pure relativistic origin , i.e. the so - called pair currents  @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical calculations should therefore follow relativistic approaches .",

    "the separable kernel of interaction is very useful  @xcite .",
    "the separable kernel is well known from nonrelativistic consideration to solve the lippman - schwinger equation analytically  @xcite .",
    "the separable form of interaction is good not only for the technical reason but , in our opinion , also for the reflection of the nonlocal type of elementary nucleon - nucleon interaction ( it was stressed first in papers  @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us not only to avoid the divergence peculiar of local theories but also to take into account the internal structure of the nucleon .    in the paper",
    ", we consider the bs equation for @xmath1-matrix and solve it using the separable kernel of interaction for a spin - one - half particle system ( for a spin - zero case see , for example , @xcite and for trinucleon systems  @xcite ) .",
    "this allows us to solve the bs equation without referring to the ladder approximation .",
    "we also find dispersion relations for the obtained solution which allow us to perform explicit analytic calculations and connect internal parameters of the kernel with experimental data : low - energy parameters , bound state energy , and phase shifts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : after the partial - wave decomposition of the bs equation ( section  [ sec : decomp ] ) , the one - rank separable kernel of interaction is introduced and used for solving the bs equation ( section  [ sec : separable ] ) .",
    "dispersion relations for the @xmath1-matrix are discussed in section  [ sec : disper ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "ladder ] , it is shown that the separable kernel of interaction includes the kernel in the ladder approximation , and the connection between parameters of two kernels is found . section  [ sec : results ] is devoted to results of calculation of the low - energy parameters , bound state energy , and phase shifts of elastic @xmath0-scattering and to the discussion for the future works .",
