    "the discovery of the giant magneto resistance ( gmr ) in magnetic multilayers  @xcite has generated an important interest .",
    "these systems are made of a sandwich of alternating ferromagnetic and non magnetic layers .",
    "valet and fert proposed a semi classical description of the perpendicular gmr , on the basis of a boltzmann equation incorporating a spin - dependent transport in the presence of spin accumulation  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "spin accumulation occurs in the gmr because the current arising from a ferromagnet is spin polarized , and therefore can not penetrate a ferromagnet with an opposite magnetization .",
    "instead , spin accumulates at the interface .",
    "this phenomenon occurs also at the interface between a ferromagnet and a superconductor , where a spin polarized current can not penetrate the superconductor  @xcite . here",
    ", we would like to reconsider two particular aspects of spin accumulation , namely , ( i ) in the semi classical regime , the possibility of an inverse drude scaling of the conductance meaning that , in some parameter range , the conductance increases with the length of the conductor ; and ( ii ) in the quantum coherent regime , the existence of a resonance in the spin flip channels .",
    "more precisely , we study a ferromagnet - normal metal - ferromagnet spin valve , in which we assume the presence of magnetic scattering in the normal metal  @xcite . the inverse drude scaling resulting from spin accumulation",
    "is already implicitly contained in the equations obtained by valet and fert  @xcite , but , to our knowledge , this effect has not been studied previously _ per se _ in the literature , which we do here .",
    "spin accumulation corresponds to the presence of a different chemical potential for the spin - up and spin - down electrons , which obey a spin diffusion equation  @xcite .",
    "our treatment is not based on the spin diffusion equation , but relies on an exact solution of the 1d boltzmann equation where we can make an exact decoupling between the charge and spin sectors .",
    "next , we ask to what extend a quantum model can show a similar physics .",
    "we are lead to study a quantum `` spin - flip fabry perot '' interferometer in which a single magnetic impurity is located at a given distance @xmath0 away from a ferromagnet interface .",
    "we find the existence of a fabry - perot resonance in the spin - flip channels as the parameter @xmath0 is varied .",
    "this resonance disappears as the ferromagnet spin polarization is decreased , and can therefore be viewed as the equivalent of the inverse drude behavior in the quantum coherent regime .",
    "our treatment is based on a landauer approach , similar to the one used by zhu and wang to study the effect of magnetic scattering close to a superconductor interface  @xcite .",

    "the presence of the ferromagnets close to the normal metal may lead to magnetic flux lines penetrating inside the normal metal , which can orient the magnetic impurities in a preferential direction .",
    "we implicitly assume that the temperature is high enough so that the impurities have no preferential orientation .",
    "we consider a one dimensional model because only in this geometry can we decouple the spin and charge sectors of the boltzmann equation .",
    "we assume that the interfaces between the ferromagnets and the normal metal are sharp , and that the exchange field has a step function variation at the interface .",
    "we note @xmath1 the semi classical distribution function of right / left moving spin-@xmath2 electrons with an energy @xmath3 at position @xmath4 .",
    "the boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation reads @xmath5 where we have discarded the term involving the electric field .",
    "this is valid if the temperature of the electrodes is larger than the applied voltage , in which case the electronic gas has a temperature identical to the one of the electrodes  @xcite .",
