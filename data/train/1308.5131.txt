    "a precise definition of the intersection bibracket requires considerable efforts and occupies about two thirds of the paper .",
    "first of all , we introduce a version of singular homology in which the role of simplices is played by manifolds with corners .",

    "for any topological space @xmath81 , we define _ polychains _ in @xmath81 as oriented manifolds with corners endowed with an identification of some faces and with a map to @xmath81 compatible with this identification .",
    "the connected components of a polychain are equipped with @xmath82-valued weights which replace the coefficients of singular simplices in singular chains .",
    "we define a _ reduction _ of polychains which eliminates redundant connected components ( like , for example , components of weight zero ) .",

    "polycycle_. the polycycles in @xmath81 considered up to disjoint unions with reduced boundaries form a graded vector space @xmath83 called the _",
    "face homology _ of @xmath81 .",

    "next , we define smooth polychains in the loop space @xmath85 of @xmath0 and study transversality for them .",
    "we show that all face homology classes of @xmath86 can be represented by smooth polycycles , and all pairs of face homology classes of @xmath87 can be represented by transversal smooth polycycles .",
    "this allows us to carry out the intersection construction above and obtain a linear map @xmath88 this map descends to a linear map in singular homology @xmath89 where @xmath90 . finally , the k \" unneth theorem allows us to rewrite the latter as a linear map @xmath91 which turns out to be a gerstenhaber bibracket .",
    "the condition that @xmath82 is a field is needed only in the k \" unneth theorem ; most of our exposition is therefore given over an arbitrary commutative ring .    replacing loops based at @xmath60 with paths in @xmath0 connecting any points of @xmath92 , we obtain a notion of a _ path homology category _ of @xmath0 .",
    "the intersection bibracket in the pontryagin algebra and the induced gerstenhaber brackets in representation algebras naturally extend to this wider framework .",

    "the ( isomorphism class of the ) intersection bibracket in its pontryagin algebra and the induced gerstenhaber brackets are invariants of  @xmath93 . under additional assumptions on  @xmath93",

    "this work suggests a number of questions .",
    "is the intersection bibracket sensitive to the smooth structure ? can it be generalized to pl - manifolds or to topological manifolds ? can it be defined in the spirit of @xcite in homotopy - theoretic terms ?",
    "note that the technique of face homology allows to define all the chas  sullivan operations @xcite .",
