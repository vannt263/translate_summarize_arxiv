    "the phenomenon that the satellite galaxies exhibit strong degree of anisotropy in their spatial distributions has recently provoked two - fold controversy : ( i ) whether the anisotropy is along the minor or major axes of the host galaxies ; ( ii ) whether it is consistent with the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm or not .",
    "in fact , the first observational report of this phenomenon dates back to more than three decades ago .",
    "@xcite analyzed the two dimensional projected positions of the satellite galaxies of nearby spirals , and found an effect ( the holmberg effect ) that the satellite locations within the projected radii @xmath0 kpc are quite biased toward the regions around the minor axes of their hosts . in the beginning",
    ", the holmberg effect was suspected not to be real , but due to either the poor number statistics or the projection effects @xcite .",
    "it is only very recently when this effect gains supporting evidence for its existence .",
    "@xcite used a large sample of spiral galaxies and their satellites collected from the two degree field galaxy redshift survey @xcite , and found that the satellites have indeed a strong tendency to be located near the minor axes of their hosts as holmberg claimed more than three decades ago .    in spite of the compelling evidence presented in @xcite , the holmberg effect has yet to be confirmed , because another recent report arouse a new suspicion .",
    "@xcite conducted an analysis of the satellite galaxies about isolated host galaxies in the second data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sdss ) , and found that the anisotropy of the satellite spatial distribution is along not the minor but the _ major _ axis of the host galaxies , in direct contrast with the holmberg effect .",
    "a cosmological turmoil surrounding the satellite anisotropy was caused by the other very recent report .",
    "kroupa , theis , & boily ( 2005 ) showed that the milky way ( mw ) dwarf satellites are located near polar plane @xcite , and claimed that this anisotropic distribution of mw satellites is inconsistent with being drawn from a cdm substructure population . shortly after @xcite , a flurry of numerical studies demonstrated that the cdm model indeed predicts anisotropic satellite distributions .",
    "kang et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed by their high - resolution n - body simulation that the satellites are likely to lie in the plane defined by the major and intermediate axes of the host halo .",
    "@xcite confirmed the findings of @xcite by providing the numerical results that the dark halo substructures on galactic scales are preferentially located along the major axes of the triaxial mass distributions of their hosts , proving that the cdm paradigm does not predict the isotropic spatial distribution of satellite galaxies ( see also , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite also performed high - resolution simulations of the galactic cdm halos to verify that the satellite anisotropy is not inconsistent with the cdm cosmology .    yet , an important problem highlighted by @xcite still remains a mystery : why are those halos forming the luminous dsphs located in a disk - like configuration almost perpendicular to its host galaxy ?",
    "this question in fact holds a crucial key to understanding the formation of galaxies since if dsphs are assumed to follow the dark matter distribution , the observed polar alignment of dsphs indicates a disagreement between the baryons of the host galaxy and its dark matter halos .",
    "to address this issue and confirm the holmberg effect , it is necessary first to understand the physical origin of the satellite anisotropy . now that several numerical studies proved",
    "that the satellite anisotropy is consistent with the cdm model , it should be possible to construct a theoretical model for the anisotropic spatial distribution of satellites in the cdm context .",
    "the standard scenario explains that the anisotropy in the satellite distribution is originated from the anisotropic infall of material along filaments ( west 1989 , bond , kofman , & pogosyan 1996 ) .",
    "but , their explanations were inconclusive , making no quantitative prediction for the degree of anisotropy expected on different scales .",
    "very recently , lee , kang , & jing ( 2005 , hereafter lkj05 ) pointed out the incompleteness of the anisotropic infall scenario in their studies of the anisotropic _ orientations _ ( not the anisotropic locations ) of dark halo substructures .",
    "they claimed that since the anisotropic infall is a primordial effect , being quickly damped away by the subsequent nonlinear process like the secondary infall , it is unlikely to be the direct cause for the anisotropic orientations of substructures .",
    "they assumed that the substructure anisotropic orientations must be caused by the tidal interactions with the gravitational fields in the triaxial mass distribution of their host halos , and constructed an analytic model for the alignments between the major axes of the substructures and their host halos from the physical principles , which turned out to be in good agreement with simulation results .",
    "motivated by the success of lkj05 model , here we attempt to construct a similar analytic model for the _ anisotropic spatial distribution _ of dark halo substructures assuming that the anisotropy in the spatial locations of substructures are also induced by the tidal interaction with the gravitational field in the triaxial mass distribution of host halos .",
    "our final goal is to develop an algorithm for reconstructing the triaxial shapes of host halos from the observable anisotropic spatial distribution of their substructures by using this analytic model . throughout this paper",
    ", we assume a _ concordance _",
    "@xmath1cdm cosmology with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite claimed that the position vectors of dark halos are related to the tidal shear tensors , and suggested that the relationship between the two quantities can be written as a first - order correlation ( see eq . [ 12 ] in lee & pen 2001 ) .",
    "they supported their claims by n - body simulations ( see also * ? ? ? * ) where it was found that the tidal shear tensors are indeed correlated with the halo position vectors at first order .",
    "although they did not show that it also holds on the substructure scale , we extrapolate here their claim to the substructure scale , and adopt an _",
    "ansatz _ that the position vectors of dark halo substructures are correlated with the tidal shear tensors of their host halos at first order .",
    "suppose that a subhalo lies in the perturbation potential field @xmath5 inside its triaxial host halo .",
    "the potential @xmath5 is assumed to be smoothed on the host halo mass scale .",
    "let @xmath6 be the initial position of the subhalo when there is no interaction with the host halo potential field , and let also @xmath7 represent the final position of the subhalo under the interaction of the host halo potential .",
    "both vectors , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are defined in the center of mass frame of the host halo .",
    "following the linear scheme @xcite , the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the host halo potential may be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the linear growth rate of the density field .",
    "note that @xmath8 in equation ( [ eqn : zel ] ) represents the displacement of the subhalo position generated by the interaction with their host halo gravitational field .",
    "taylor - expanding @xmath5 to second order around the host halo center of mass , we have @xmath14 differentiating equation ( [ eqn : psi ] ) gives @xmath15 putting equation ( [ eqn : difpsi ] ) into equation ( [ eqn : zel ] ) , we end up with @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the tidal shear tensor defined as @xmath18 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : xq ] ) implies that the subhalo displacement is a bulk motion generated by the nonzero quadrupole moment of the triaxial gravitational potential of the host halo .",
    "one might think that since equation ( [ eqn : zel ] ) is derived from the linear perturbation theory based on the zeldovich approximation , it should be invalid in the highly nonlinear regime .",
    "but , @xcite showed by n - body simulations that even in the highly nonlinear regime the correlation between the halo position vector and the tidal shear tensor can be written as first order like equation ( [ eqn : xq ] )    to investigate how the direction of @xmath8 is distributed given @xmath19 , we first consider the covariance @xmath20 . using equation ( [ eqn : xq ] ) , we have @xmath21 .",
    "if the two tensors , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , were mutually independent , then , we would end up with having a simple expression , @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "however , it it not necessarily true that @xmath22 is uncorrelated with @xmath23 .    to take into consideration the possible correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and to overcome the limited validity of the linear approximation , we use the following parametrized formula as @xcite did : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the rescaled position vector ( rescaled in a sense that it does not have a dimension of `` length '' ) , @xmath28 is the unit tidal shear tensor with _ non - zero trace _ :",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 ( we use the notation of @xmath31 to distinguish it from the traceless unit tidal shear tensor @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is a free parameter in the range of @xmath34 $ ] to quantify the correlation between @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in the linear theory ,",
    "the value of @xmath33 is given as unity .",
    "note that equation ( [ eqn : quadratic ] ) , although it is derived from the linear perturbation theory , has already included the nonlinear effect .",
    "the correlation parameter , @xmath33 , quantifies how the correlation between @xmath8 and @xmath19 differs from the linear theory prediction .",
    "the degree of the deviation of its value from unity measures how strong the nonlinear effect is .",
    "it is also worth noting that equation ( [ eqn : quadratic ] ) bears a close resemblance to the quadratic formula used by lkj05 for the correlation between the dark halo angular momentum @xmath37 and the unit traceless tidal shear field @xmath38 defined as @xmath39 with @xmath40 @xmath41 where the correlation parameter @xmath42 is in the range of @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "lkj05 used equation ( [ eqn : spin - shear ] ) to investigate the alignments between the major axes of substructures and their host halos .",
    "similar as equations ( [ eqn : quadratic ] ) and ( [ eqn : spin - shear ] ) look , it is very important to recognize the key differences between the two . in equation ( [ eqn : spin - shear ] ) ,",
    "@xmath44 is traceless .",
    "consequently , @xmath45 is preferentially aligned only with the _ intermediate _ principal axis of @xmath19 .",
    "whereas in equation ( [ eqn : quadratic ] ) @xmath31 has non - zero trace .",
    "consequently , @xmath8 is preferentially aligned with either the _ minor _ or the _ major _ principal axis of @xmath19 : if @xmath33 is negative , then @xmath8 is aligned with the minor axis of @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath33 is positive , @xmath8 is aligned with the major axis of @xmath19 .",
    "strictly speaking , equation ( [ eqn : quadratic ] ) holds only if @xmath31 and @xmath8 are smoothed on the same scale .",
    "here , they do nt : @xmath31 is supposed to be smoothed on the host halo mass scale , while @xmath8 on the substructure radii . for simplicity , here , we just assume that equation ( [ eqn : quadratic ] ) still holds , ignoring the difference between the host halo and their substructure smoothing scales .",
    "in a similar manner with lkj05 , assuming that the probability density distribution of @xmath46 is gaussian , and expressing the position vectors @xmath8 in terms of the spherical polar coordinates in the principal axis frame of @xmath19 as @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 : the polar and the azimuthal angles of @xmath8 , respectively , we derive the probability density distribution of the cosines of the polar angles , @xmath51 as : @xmath52 @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the three eigenvalues of the tidal shear tensor @xmath19 in a decreasing order , and @xmath55 are the unit eigenvalues of @xmath31 defined as @xmath56 .    in the linear density field ,",
    "the sum of all the three eigenvalues of the tidal shear tensor equals the linear density contrast : @xmath57 . according to the spherical dynamical collapse model , a gravitational bound object forms when the linear density contrast reaches its critical value , @xmath58 .",
    "hence , one can say that inside the host halo @xmath59 .",
    "the value of the critical density contrast , @xmath58 , scales with the redshift @xmath60 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the critical value at @xmath63 , which depends very weakly on cosmology @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath64 for the flat universe of closure density .",
    "now , one can rewrite equation ( [ eqn : hatlam_lam ] ) as @xmath65    as lkj05 did , we assume further that the tidal shear and the inertia shape tensors of the host halos are strongly correlated with each other in an opposite direction @xcite , so that the minor and the major axes of the tidal shear tensor are the major and minor axes of the inertia shape tensor",
    ". under this assumption , equation ( [ eqn : alpha_dis ] ) basically represents the probability density distribution of the cosines of the angles between the position vectors of the substructures and the major principal axes of their host halo .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : alpha_dis ] ) reveals that @xmath51 depends sensitively on the value of @xmath33 : if @xmath66 , @xmath8 is aligned with the major axis of the host halo ( the minor axis of @xmath19 ) ; if @xmath67 , @xmath8 is aligned with the minor axis of the host halo ( the major axis of the @xmath19 ) ; if @xmath68 , there is no alignment between @xmath8 and any principal axis of the host halo .",
    "note that even when @xmath69 , it is possible to have no alignment between @xmath8 and the host halo axes . the distribution @xmath51 depends not only on the value of @xmath33 but also on the unit eigenvalues with non - zero trace , @xmath70 . for the case of the _ traceless _ eigenvalues of @xmath71 which satisfies the two constraints : @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( see @xmath74 in lkj05 ) , their values are well approximated as the average @xmath75 and @xmath76 regardless of the original values of @xmath77 .",
    "however , for @xmath70 , the constraints ( eq.[[eqn : hatlam_lam ] ] ) are expressed in terms of the original values of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , even when the correlation parameter @xmath33 has the maximum absolute value ( i.e. , @xmath78 = 1 ) , if the host halo has almost spherical shape satisfying @xmath79 , then @xmath51 becomes uniform , implying no anisotropy in the spatial distribution of substructures .",
    "to find @xmath51 numerically , we use the same numerical data as used in lkj05 which were generated by p@xmath80 m n - body simulations with @xmath81 particles in a @xmath82mpc cube @xcite for the @xmath1cdm cosmology with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 . in the simulation data , we selected four dark halos on mass scales around @xmath83 , and identified the self - bound substructures in each host halo by using the subfind routine of @xcite .",
    "for the detailed descriptions of the n - body simulations and the subhalo identification procedure , see @xmath84 in lkj05 .    for each host halo selected in the numerical data , we compute the inertia shape tensor @xmath85 and determine the major principal axis by finding the eigenvector @xmath86 of @xmath87 corresponding to the largest eigenvalue .",
    "in each host halo principal axis frame , we measure the unit position vectors of the subhalos @xmath88 , and the cosines of the angles , @xmath49 , between the major axis of the host halo and the locations of their subhalos by computing @xmath89 .",
    "we find the probability density distribution , @xmath51 by counting the subhalo number density as a function of @xmath90 .",
    "we fit our analytic model ( eq.[[eqn : alpha_dis ] ] ) to this numerically determined @xmath51 with setting the three parameters , @xmath91 ( @xmath92 is not independent according to eq.[[eqn : hatlam_lam ] ] ) and @xmath33 as free , and determine the best - fit values of the free parameters by means of the @xmath93 statistics .",
    "we perform this procedure for each individual host halo ( cl#1 , cl#2 , cl#3 , cl#4 ) separately at four different redshifts ( @xmath94 )",
    ".    figure [ fig : pro_dis ] plots the final fitting results . in each panel ,",
    "the histogram represents the numerically measured @xmath51 , while the ( red ) solid curve corresponds to the analytic distribution ( eq.[[eqn : alpha_dis ] ] ) with the best - fit correlation parameter , @xmath33 .",
    "as one can see , for all cases , the best - fit correlation parameter @xmath33 has a negative value .",
    "in other words , the dark halo substructures are preferentially located near the _ major _ axes of their host halos , consistent with previous numerical findings @xcite . indeed , the analytic distributions agree with the numerical results for all four clusters at all redshifts quite well .    as a final step , we reconstruct the triaxial shapes of the four host halos from their distributions @xmath51 . for this purpose ,",
    "we adopt the following formula suggested recently by @xcite : @xmath95 where @xmath96 represent the three axis lengths of the triaxial host halos in a decreasing order . equation ( [ eqn : axis_lambda ] ) basically links the two axes ratios of the triaxial host halos to the eigenvalues of the tidal shear tensors . according to this equation ,",
    "once @xmath97 is determined , then one can reconstruct the axis - ratios of the host halos .",
    "equations ( [ eqn : hatlam_lam ] ) and ( [ eqn : hatlam_delc ] ) allow one to determine the values of @xmath97 from the best - fit values of @xmath98 as @xmath99 we use @xmath100 as an approximation and the best - fit values of @xmath101 to determine the values of @xmath102 using equation ( [ eqn : lam_hatdelc ] ) for each host halo , and finally reconstruct the axis - ratios of the host halo using equation ( [ eqn : axis_lambda ] ) . with the above method",
    ", we finally reconstruct the two axis - ratios of all four clusters at four redshifts .",
    "figure [ fig : axis_ratio ] plots the intermediate - to - major axis ratio vs. the minor - to - major axis ratios of the four clusters at four redshifts . in each panel ,",
    "the ( red ) triangle dot represents the reconstructed axis - ratios by the above algorithm , and the ( blue ) square dot is the original axis - ratios from simulations .",
    "although the reconstruction does not look perfect , it works quite satisfactorily , especially given all the approximations used in the algorithm .",
    "it is obvious that at least one of the two axis - ratios is fairly accurately reconstructed .",
    "we note that for the case of @xmath103 , the difference between @xmath104 and @xmath105 is relatively large , which trend is also reconstructed well by our algorithm .",
    "our achievements are summarized as follows : ( i ) we construct an analytic model for the anisotropic spatial distribution of dark halo substructures ; ( ii ) we confirm numerically that the dark halo substructures have a strong propensity to be located near the _ major _ axes of their host halos ; ( iii ) we develop an algorithm to reconstruct the triaxial shapes of dark halos from the anisotropic spatial distribution of their substructures .",
    "successful as are our analytic model and the reconstruction algorithm based on it , it is worth noting a couple of its inconsistencies .",
    "first , as mentioned in  2 , equation ( [ eqn : alpha_dis ] ) holds only when the tidal shear field is smoothed on the substructure radii .",
    "we ignored the smoothing scale difference , which should cause some scatters in the measurement of the correlation parameter @xmath33 .",
    "second , we adopted the spherical collapse condition @xmath106 even though we consider triaxial dark matter halos .",
    "definitely , it will be necessary to refine our analytic model further , accounting for these two inconsistencies .",
    "another limitation of our model is that its underlying assumption has been numerically tested only for the case of the concordance cosmology .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : axis_lambda ] ) was shown to work only provided that the background cosmology is described by the concordance cosmology @xcite . to find the dependence of the correlation parameter , @xmath33 , on cosmology , and to apply the model to a broader range of cosmological models",
    ", it will be first necessary to make more general assumptions and to test the underlying assumptions against numerical results , which is definitely beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "now that we proved that it can reconstruct _ in principle _ the axis - ratios of triaxial dark halos from the anisotropic spatial distribution of substructures for the concordance @xmath1cdm model , it is worth discussing about how to apply the algorithm to real data from observations of such as the weak gravitational lensing . in our analytic model ,",
    "the substructure positions are defined in the real three dimensional space relative to the principal axes of host halos , which is , however , very difficult to determine in practice . in observations",
    "they are measured in the two dimensional space projected along the line - of - sight direction which is not necessarily coincident with the host halo principal axis .",
    "therefore , to apply our reconstruction algorithm to real data , it will be necessary first to find an analytic expression of the substructure spatial distributions in the general non - principal axis frame and to account for the effect of projection along the line - of - sight .",
    "our future work is in this direction , and we wish to report it elsewhere soon .    another direction is to explain the holmberg effect . as shown , our analytic model for the substructure spatial distribution ( eq.[[eqn : alpha_dis ] ] ) is characterized by the single correlation parameter , @xmath33 . by investigating what physical mechanism caused the correlation parameter to change their signs , it might be possible to explain the holmberg effect theoretically .",
    "finally , we conclude that our analytic model may provide a physical quantitative understanding of the anisotropic spatial distribution of dark halo substructures , and will allow us to determine in principle the axis - ratios of triaxial dark halos from the observables .",
