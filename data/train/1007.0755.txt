    "over the past decade , new cosmological observations have revolutionised our view of the universe by showing increasing evidence that it is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "the hubble diagram of type 1a supernovae ( sn1a ) @xcite , together with other independent data sets like observations of the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite combined with measurements of the large scale structure ( lss ) of the galaxy distribution @xcite , have established the picture of a geometrically flat universe whose energy content is composed of about @xmath2 baryonic matter , @xmath3 of cold dark matter and @xmath4 of a mysterious component called dark energy ( de ) , responsible for the current acceleration of the expansion rate .",
    "the nature of dark energy is one of the most important open questions in modern cosmology as the comprehension of its nature has deep implications for our understanding of fundamental physics . in the past few years",
    "a substantial effort has been devoted to constrain the properties of dark energy as accurately as possible in order to distinguish between possible alternative descriptions of this phenomenon ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "this effort will continue in the coming years with the construction of the next generation of large galaxy surveys , like the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the dark energy survey ( des , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the baryonic oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hobby eberly telescope dark energy experiment ( hetdex , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and , on a longer time scale , the space based euclid mission @xcite .",
    "these surveys will cover volumes much larger than current datasets , providing a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of the constraints on the values of cosmological parameters , in particular the dark energy equation of state parameter defined as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the pressure and the energy density of this component .",
    "these new surveys will provide a clear picture of the baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , a signature imprinted in the large scale galaxy distribution by the acoustic fluctuations in the baryon - photon fluid prior to recombination .",
    "these can be seen as a quasi - harmonic series of oscillations of decreasing amplitude in the power spectrum at wave numbers @xmath8 @xcite . in the two - point correlation function ,",
    "the fourier transform of the power spectrum , the bao are visible as a unique broad and quasi - gaussian peak @xcite .",
    "the bao where first detected in the correlation function of the luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) sample drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) by @xcite and the power spectrum of the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) by @xcite ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the acoustic scale inferred from the galaxy clustering is related to the sound horizon scale at the drag epoch , i.e. when the baryons where released from the photons .",
    "because of the very high photon to baryon ratio , this epoch happened slightly later that the decoupling epoch @xcite .",
    "as this scale depends solely on the plasma physics after the big bang and can be calibrated using cmb data , it is possible to use the bao scale as a standard ruler . measuring the apparent size of the bao in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight , it is possible to measure the redshift dependence of the hubble parameter @xmath9 and the angular diameter distance @xmath10 and thus constrain cosmological parameters like @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "robust percent level constraints on @xmath1 require measurement of the bao scale at sub - percent level @xcite . in order to realize the full potential of future bao measurements as a cosmological probe , a detailed analysis of the possible systematic effects introduced by the non - linear evolution of density fluctuations , redshift space distortions and bias",
    "is required .",
    "recent studies based on the analysis of large volume n - body simulations and on novel approaches to perturbation theory ( e.g. renormalized perturbation theory , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have shown that non - linearities introduce shifts of up to few percent in the position of the bao peaks with respect to the prediction of linear theory , both in the correlation function and in the power spectrum @xcite .",
    "redshift - space distortions and bias might introduce additional shifts . when not properly taken into account ,",
    "these distortions introduce systematic errors in the obtained constraints that can be larger than the expected measurement errors .",
    "this highlights the importance of using a model able to take in account these distortions with the accuracy demanded by the future surveys .",
    "the modelling of non - linear distortions in the bao signal in the power spectrum has been the focus of much theoretical work @xcite .",
    "most of these analyses have focused on modelling the bao signal filtered out from the broad band shape of the power spectrum .",
    "this approach attempts to produce a purely geometrical test based on the bao signal , but it has the disadvantage of discarding useful information contained in the full shape of the power spectrum .",
    "@xcite showed that the correlation function is much less affected by scale dependent effects than the power spectrum and that its full shape can be described by a simple model , originally proposed by @xcite , with the accuracy required for surveys of up to two orders of magnitude larger than present day samples .",
    "@xcite applied this model to the lrg correlation function measured by @xcite and performed a detailed analysis of the constraints on cosmological parameters , obtaining an improvement of roughly a factor two in the accuracy of the constraints on the dark energy equation of state with respect to the ones recovered by using only the bao signal in the power spectrum .    in this work we present a new model for the full shape of the power spectrum which is based on the model for the correlation function of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we compare this model against the real and redshift space power spectra of the dark matter and halo distributions obtained from an ensemble of large volume , moderate resolution n - body simulations ( l - basicc ii * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in section [ l - ps ] we describe the set of simulations used in our work and provide a few technical details about the computation of the power spectrum . in section [ model ] we introduce our theoretical model of the full shape of the power spectrum . in section [ p_k_fit ]",
    "we determine the range of scales in which this model is able to accurately describe the results drawn from the numerical simulations and recover unbiased constraints on the dark energy equation of state .",
    "finally section [ conclusion ] presents our main conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the l - basicc ii ensemble of n - body simulations used in our analysis ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) and give some technical details about the methodology implemented to compute the power spectra from these simulations .",
    "a more detailed description can be found in appendix [ ap : power_spectrum ] .",
    "we use an ensemble of 50 moderate resolution , very large volume dark matter n - body simulations called l - basicc ii @xcite .",
    "these are analogues of the l - basicc simulations used in @xcite and represent the evolution of the dark matter density field in a universe characterised with a flat @xmath11cdm cosmology , consistent with the constraints on cosmological parameters obtained from the combination of cmb and lss information of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the values of the cosmological parameters and other specifications of the simulations are listed in table [ tab1:sim ] .",
    ".cosmological parameters and specifications of the l - basicc ii simulations .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > \" , ]     as described in section  [ sec : testing ] , we compute the value of @xmath12 and its variance fixing the other parameters to their mean values as obtained from the mcmc . since this represents the large scale linear bias , we can calculate the kaiser boost factor simply as : @xmath13 with @xmath12 and @xmath14 the real and redshift - space linear bias .",
    "the values of @xmath15 obtained for the dark matter case are listed , together with the theoretical values @xmath16 , in table  [ tab : bias ] .",
    "the three values of @xmath16 are also indicated in figure [ fig : ps_computeddm_ratio ] with the upper dotted lines . as can be seen the agreement between the theoretical and the recovered values are excellent at all the redshifts .",
    "the shaded contours within solid lines in figure  [ fig : maps_fitdm ] show the two - dimensional 68% and 95% marginalized constraints in the @xmath17 plane obtained from the mean redshift - space power spectrum from the l - basicc ii simulations for @xmath18 at @xmath19 ( panel _ a _ ) , 0,5 ( _ b _ ) and 1 ( _ c _ ) . as in the case of real - space information , there is no degeneracy between these parameters .",
    "redshift space distortions increase the damping of the bao signal .",
    "this is reflected in the mean values of @xmath20 being systematically lower than the ones obtained from real - space data .",
    "figure  [ fig : maps_ka_dm ] shows the correspondent constraints in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "the scale - dependent effects introduced by redshift - space distortions cause these two parameters to follow a different degeneracy than in the real - space case although the qualitative behavior is maintained .          in previous sections we compared the model of equation  ( [ eq : rpt_mod ] ) against the clustering of the dark matter distribution",
    ". however , when dealing with real observational data sets , only the clustering pattern of the galaxy distribution can be used to obtain cosmological information . the relationship between the galaxy and matter density fields can be highly non - trivial , adding an extra complication to the interpretation of clustering measurements in terms of constraints on cosmological parameters ( e.g. see * ? ? ?",
    "a general galaxy sample is composed of central and satellite galaxies .",
    "the former are assumed to lie at or near the centre of the dark matter haloes while the later can be associated with the sub - structure present in more massive haloes that already contain a central galaxy . in redshift space ,",
    "the signature of the fingers - of - god effect can be associated with the contribution of the satellite galaxies , which then are responsible for the most important non - linear redshift space distortions .",
    "@xcite analysed the sdss dr2 compressing the fingers - of - god into isotropic structures .",
    "recently @xcite proposed a method to reconstruct the underlying halo density field from a galaxy sample by identifying fingers - of - god like structures and replacing them by one single halo .",
    "this procedure effectively eliminates the contribution of the satellite galaxies , which would correspond to the one - halo term in the halo - model formalism , from the measured power spectrum .",
    "this minimizes the impact of non - linear redshift - space distortions in the shape of the measured @xmath22 .",
    "hence , in order to extract cosmological information from these measurements , a model of the full shape of the halo power spectrum is required .",
    "@xcite also proposed a model , calibrated against numerical simulations , that relates the halo power spectrum to the linear theory prediction for the dark matter distribution . in this section",
    "we compare the model of equation  ( [ eq : rpt_mod ] ) against the halo power spectra of the l - basicc ii ensemble of simulations for different halo samples .    according to linear theory ,",
    "a simple relation is expected to hold between the dark matter and halo power spectra characterized by a scale - independent bias factor @xmath23 @xmath24 the results of numerical simulations have shown that this simple picture is only valid on very large scales and that , due to the effects of non - linear evolution , halo bias is a strong function of both scale and halo mass @xcite .",
    "these distortions must be carefully modelled in order to obtain unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters from the full shape of the halo power spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : ps_computed0 ] shows the mean power spectra at @xmath19 of the total halo sample of the simulations , @xmath25 ( panel _ b _ ) , the power spectra of the three mass bins described in section  [ l - basicc ] , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( panels _ a _ , _ d _ and _ g _ ) , and their respective cross power spectra , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( panels _ c _ , _ e _ and _ f _ ) . to increase the dynamical range of the plot ,",
    "these power spectra have been divided by the same non - wiggle linear - theory power spectrum as in figure  [ fig : ps_computeddm_ratio ] .",
    "circles correspond to the real - space measurements while their redshift - space counterparts are shown by triangles , with the dot - dashed lines representing their respective variances from the ensemble of simulations .",
    "we obtained constraints on the parameter space defined in section  [ sec : testing ] for different values of @xmath32 by applying the model of equation  ( [ eq : rpt_mod ] ) to our measurements of the halo auto and cross power spectra .",
    "as example , figure  [ fig : errors_alpha ] shows the constraints on @xmath33 as a function of @xmath32 obtained from @xmath25 in real ( panels _ g _ , _ h _ and _ i _ ) and redshift - space ( panels _ j _ , _ k _ and _ l _ ) for @xmath19 , 0.5 and 1 , respectively .",
    "the dot - dashed lines correspond to their 68% and 95% confidence levels . due to the lower number densities of the halo samples , the variances of these power spectra are larger than for the dark matter case and increase with increasing redshift .",
    "this leads to an increase in the allowed regions for @xmath33 with respect to the ones obtained using @xmath34 . despite this difference",
    ", these results show a similar qualitative behavior to the constraints obtained from the dark matter power spectrum , with a mean value consistent with @xmath35 up to @xmath36 .",
    "the constraints on @xmath33 obtained from the fit at different redshifts for @xmath37 are listed in table  [ tab : alpha ] . the solid lines in figure [ fig : ps_computed0 ]",
    "show the model power spectrum of equation   computed using the mean values of the four parameters obtained for this value of @xmath32 .",
    "the absence of a non - linear contribution from the fingers - of - god effect makes the scale dependence of redshift space distortions much less significant for the halo power spectrum than for the dark matter case @xcite .",
    "this can be clearly seen in figure  [ fig : ps_computed0 ] , where the differences in the shape of the real and redshift - space power spectra are small .",
    "this is reflected on the constraints on the stretch parameters , which in the redshift - space case show a similar behavior to those obtained using the real - space measurements .",
    "figure  [ fig : maps_fit0 ] shows the two - dimensional constraints in the @xmath38 plane obtained using the mean auto and cross power spectra for the different halo samples at @xmath19 .",
    "the dashed lines show the 68% and 95% confidence limits obtained from real - space information while the solid lines correspond to the redshift - space case .",
    "the difference between the constraints obtained in the two cases is less significant than in the dark matter case shown in figure  [ fig : maps_fitdm ] .",
    "the constraints on @xmath20 are broad due to the degeneracy between this parameter and @xmath39 ; nonetheless @xmath20 seems to prefer smaller values in redshift space , in accordance with the more important damping of the bao features .",
    "in contrast to the behavior found in the analysis of the dark matter power spectrum , when applied to the different halo samples the ability of the model to obtain unbiased constraints on the stretch parameter degrades with increasing redshift and at @xmath40 they are only marginally consistent with @xmath35 . this is related to the mass resolution of the l - basicc ii simulations : the smallest halo mass that can be resolved corresponds to @xmath41 . while at @xmath19 these haloes are moderately biased tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution , at @xmath40 they are much rarer objects that reside in very dense , and thus highly non - linear , regions .",
    "hence , an accurate description of the shape of the power spectrum of such high mass objects at high redshifts requires a more detailed model of the non - linear distortions than that of equation  .",
    "the shape of the cross power spectra @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 can also be accurately described by the model of equation  ( [ eq : rpt_mod ] ) . as can be seen in table  [ tab : alpha ] , in all cases the constraints on @xmath33 derived from these measurements are in good agreement with @xmath35 and are tighter than the ones derived from their correspondent auto power spectra .",
    "as stated at in section [ pk_comp ] , the halo catalogues are affected by the exclusion effect introduced by the friend - of - friends algorithm used to identify them . to account for a possible difference in the large scale amplitude of the shot - noise",
    "as could be caused by this effect , we have repeated the analysis adding a constant term to the model of equation which we allowed to vary over a wide flat prior .",
    "our findings indicate that such a term is degenerate with @xmath20 and @xmath39 , while the constraints of @xmath33 are not affected .",
    "we recover the values of the bias @xmath12 for all the power spectra in figure  [ fig : ps_computed0 ] as indicated in section  [ sec : testing ] .",
    "the real space biases are listed in table  [ tab : bias ] and @xmath45 is shown by lower dotted lines in figure  [ fig : ps_computed0 ] . as a comparison we also list the theoretical values of the effective bias @xmath46 for the corresponding halo samples computed using the mass function proposed by @xcite and the halo bias prescription obtained from the spherical collapse model @xcite , which show a reasonable agreement with the measurements from the simulation with the exception of the high mass sample .",
    "table  [ tab : bias ] also shows the values of the kaiser boost factor of equation   computed using @xmath46 and the ones obtained from the measured power spectra ( equation [ eq : kaiser_ourmodel ] ) : as for the dark matter case , they agree remarkably well . since the dependency of equation   on @xmath12 is very weak , the difference between @xmath16 computed with @xmath46 and with @xmath12 is much smaller than the error bars of @xmath15 .",
    "the upper dotted lines in figure  [ fig : ps_computed0 ] correspond to the value of @xmath47 .",
    "the increasing quantity and quality of information from large galaxy redshift surveys demands models able to describe the clustering of the galaxy distribution with high accuracy .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum , the tool most commonly used to analyze galaxy clustering , is distorted by non - linear evolution , redshift - space distortions and bias .",
    "these effects complicate the relation between the observations and the predictions of linear perturbation theory , making the interpretation of these measurements in terms of constraints on cosmological parameters more difficult .    in this paper",
    "we presented a model for the full shape of the large - scale power spectrum which is based on rpt and is analogous to the approach followed by @xcite and @xcite for the two - point correlation function .",
    "we compared our model against power spectra measured in a suite of 50 large volume , moderate resolution n - body simulations , called l - basicc ii @xcite .",
    "our results indicate that the simple model presented here can provide an accurate description of the full shape of the power spectrum taking into account the effects of non - linear evolution , redshift - space distortions and halo bias for scales @xmath0 , making it a valuable tool for the analysis of real datasets .",
    "when applied to the dark matter distribution , our model gives a better description of the shape of the power spectrum at increasing redshift , where non - linear effects become less important . even though this holds both in real and redshift - space , in the latter case the model performs worse , since it does not include explicitly the effect of scale dependent redshift - space distortions .",
    "the model also gives a correct description of the shape of the halo power spectrum for different mass ranges both for real and redshift - space information . in the latter case , due to the absence of the non - linear contribution from the fingers - of - god effect ,",
    "the scale dependence of the redshift - space distortions is simplified and the obtained constraints on the stretch parameter are similar to the ones of the real - space case .",
    "@xcite performed a similar analysis for the shape of the large scale two - point correlation function .",
    "their results showed that non - linear evolution , redshift - space distortions and bias are much more simpler to deal with for the case of the correlation function than for the power spectrum , where the signature is highly scale dependent .",
    "however , it is necessary to pursue complementary approaches to constrain cosmological parameters allowing a comparison of the obtained results and a check for possible systematics .",
    "the model for the shape of power spectrum presented here has been proven to provide constraints on the stretch parameter @xmath33 similar to the ones obtained by @xcite .",
    "thus , with an accurate modelling , it is possible to extract cosmological information with the same precision from both statistics .    using a similar set of simulations to the ones used in this work",
    ", @xcite tested a model in which the information from the broad band shape of the power spectrum is discarded in order to extract a measurement of the bao oscillations only .",
    "a comparison of their results with ours shows that the extra information in the full shape of the power spectrum helps to improve the obtained constraints over the bao alone case ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , despite the relatively small number of wave modes included in our analysis , the constraints that we obtain for @xmath33 are slightly tighter than those of @xcite .",
    "the model equation  ( [ eq : rpt_mod ] ) can be extended in a number of ways , like for instance , with the use of the full rpt calculation of @xmath48 and the inclusion of higher order terms in the description of @xmath49 or a specific treatment of the effects of redshift - space distortions .",
    "this can help to extend the range of scales in which it is valid and improve the accuracy of the constraints on @xmath33 and thus the dark energy equation of state .",
    "we would like to give special thanks to raul angulo and carlton baugh for providing us with the l - basicc ii numerical simulations .",
