    "in a series of papers ( ruffert , janka & schfer 1996 ; ruffert et al . 1997 ; ruffert & janka 1999 , 2001 ) it was shown that the neutrino emission associated with the dynamical phase of the merging or collision of two neutron stars ( ns+ns ) is powerful , but too short to provide the energy for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by neutrino - antineutrino annihilation .",
    "significant heating of the coalescing stars occurs only after they have plunged into each other .",
    "the neutrino luminosities can then rise to several @xmath2 ( see also rosswog & liebendrfer 2003 ) and even exceed @xmath3 in case of the more violent ( although probably very rare ) collisions .",
    "after a few milliseconds , the compact massive remnant of the merger will most likely collapse to a black hole ( bh ) ( see , e.g. , popham , woosley & fryer 1999 , di matteo , perna & narayan 2002 , oechslin et al .",
    "2004 , shibata & ury 2000 ) .",
    "when this happens some matter can remain in a toroidal accretion disc around the bh and a funnel with low baryon density develops along the system axis .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations indicate that between some 0.01@xmath4 and a few 0.1@xmath4 of matter may have enough angular momentum to resist immediate absorption into the bh ( see , e.g. , ruffert & janka 1999 , shibata & ury 2000 ) .",
    "a similar result was obtained for bh+ns mergers ( janka et al .  1999 ,",
    "see also lee 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "this matter is swallowed by the bh on the time scale of viscous transport of angular momentum , which is much longer than the dynamical time scale .",
    "different from the collapsar case there is no external reservoir of stellar matter which feeds the accretion torus .",
    "therefore the relevant time scale is set by viscosity - driven accretion rather than infall .",
    "the accretion is only approximately stationary , if global instabilities do not play a role ( ruffert et al .",
    "1997 , lee & ramirez - ruiz 2002 ) .",
    "post - merger bh accretion might explain short grbs , but is unlikely to account for long grbs ( e.g. , narayan , piran & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "post - merger accretion tori have maximum densities between some @xmath5g@xmath6@xmath7 and more than @xmath8g@xmath6@xmath7 and extend to outer radii of 1020 times the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the accretion proceeds with rates of fractions of a solar mass per second up to several solar masses per second . in case of such `` hyperaccreting '' black hole systems ( popham et al .",
    "1999 ) photons are strongly coupled to the torus plasma and therefore are inefficient in transporting away energy .",
    "neutrinos , however , are abundantly created by weak interactions in the very dense and hot tori and a fair fraction of the gravitational binding energy of the accreted matter can be radiated away by them ( `` neutrino - dominated accretion flow '' , ndaf , popham et al .  1999 ,",

    "the annihilation of emitted neutrinos and antineutrinos is investigated for its potential to provide the energy of relativistic gamma - ray burst fireballs ( see , e.g. , eichler et al .",
    "1989 ; narayan , paczyski & piran 1992 ; woosley 1993 ) .",
    "our 3d modeling of the time - dependent ( non - stationary ) torus evolution abolishes approximations of previous ( semi-)analytic work ( e.g. , popham et al .  1999 ,",

    "the code employs three nested cartesian grids in a computational volume of 500@xmath6 km side length .",
    "each coarser grid level has the same number of zones but twice the zone size of the level below .",
    "mirror symmetry relative to the equatorial plane is assumed .",

    "1996 ) , which reduces to the paczyski - wiita potential ( paczyski & wiita 1980 ) when the bh spin parameter @xmath33 is zero .",
    "this potential mimics some general relativistic effects like the existence of an innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) and the variation of the isco and event horizon with the value of @xmath34 .",
    "the bh is represented as a gravitating `` vacuum sphere '' in our calculations .",
    "the corresponding inner boundary radius is defined by the arithmetic average of event horizon and isco .",
    "selfgravity of the torus is taken into account by a newtonian description .",
    "we use the @xmath0-prescription proposed by shakura & sunyaev  @xcite to model the physical effects of disc viscosity ( in addition to the ever present numerical viscosity ) , including the terms for viscous transport of angular momentum and dissipation of energy ( a detailed description of the technical implementation will be given elsewhere ; setiawan et al . , in preparation ) . with the numerical resolution which we could afford in the present set of simulations ,",
    "the dissipative effects of numerical viscosity should be somewhat larger than estimated for our previous work ( see ruffert & janka 1999 and janka et al .",
    "1999 ) and might correspond to an @xmath0-viscosity around 0.01 .",
    "the latter value therefore sets a lower bound to the range of @xmath0 s where we expect to observe influence by the inclusion of viscosity terms in the simulations discussed here .",
    "gravitational - wave emission and its corresponding back - reaction ( blanchet , damour & schfer 1990 ) are taken into account . a neutrino leakage scheme ( ruffert et al .",
    "1996 ) is used to calculate the energy loss and lepton number change by neutrino emission from the disc gas .",
    "the initial configurations in our simulations consist of a bh surrounded by a toroidal accretion disc .",
    "these systems are considered as remnants of bh+ns mergers and the system parameters were chosen appropriately . for this purpose",
    "we were guided by data obtained in some of the model runs described in janka et al .",
    "the simulations start with a bh that has a mass of 4.017@xmath35 and an initial rotational parameter of 0 or 0.6 , respectively .",
    "our `` reference accretion torus '' has a mass @xmath10 of 0.0478@xmath35 .",
    "this mass was changed to 0.0120@xmath35 or 0.1912@xmath35 by simply scaling the density distribution with appropriate factors .",
    "the initial temperature is around 2@xmath6mev in the inner part of the torus ( out to an equatorial distance from the system axis of @xmath3670@xmath6 km ) and still above 1@xmath6mev in the more dilute outer parts up to @xmath36130@xmath6 km . the different combinations of model parameters of our simulations can be found in table  [ tab1 ] . varing the system parameters by scaling the initial torus density and setting",
    "the bh spin parameter might appear ad hoc .",
    "one should notice , however , that a bh+ns merger is an extremely violent event which should not be expected to produce a bh - torus configuration in perfect rotational equilibrium .",
    "moreover , the torus properties will develop and adjust to the effects of viscous shear .",
    "this initial phase of relaxation after the start of our simulations does not last very long and most transients have died out already after @xmath37ms .",
    "= 1.0 mm    [ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]",
    "we have performed three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of hyperaccreting stellar mass bhs with self - gravitating , thick accretion tori , varying the torus mass , bh spin and @xmath0-viscosity of the torus gas .",
    "our models show that tori which are heated by viscous dissipation of energy get inflated by thermal pressure and are therefore unlikely to become optically thick to neutrinos .",
    "the neutrino luminosities stay well below the eddington limit @xmath38erg@xmath6s@xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is the mean neutrino opacity ( e.g. , janka 2001 ) .",
    "the latter is mostly determined by the contribution of @xmath41 which dominate the energy loss of the torus .",
    "these findings are in contrast to conclusions drawn from more approximative modeling approaches which treated the vertical structure of the torus by height - averaging ( di matteo et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "our results also suggest that the integral rate of the energy deposition by @xmath1-annihilation drops like @xmath42 during the long - time , slow decay of the accretion rate that follows an initial , transient relaxation phase of 1020@xmath6ms with very high mass accretion rates and neutrino emission .",
    "this temporal decrease is less steep than obtained in previous simulations with azimuthal symmetry which used a simple ideal gas equation state and made the assumption that all the dissipated energy is radiated away in neutrinos ( lee & ramirez - ruiz 2002 ) .",
    "we have shown that @xmath1-annihilation in the low - density funnel above the poles of the bh can deposit energy at a rate of @xmath43erg@xmath6s@xmath39 , accounting for a total energy release of some @xmath44erg in case of sufficiently large torus mass ( @xmath450.1@xmath4 ) , high disk viscosity ( @xmath46 ) and bh rotation with spin parameter @xmath47 .",
    "these conditions are expected to be generically produced by bh+ns mergers and most likely also by ns+ns mergers ( janka et al .",
    "the main effect of direct bh rotation is an increase of the lifetime of the torus .",
    "the energy release by @xmath1-annihilation satisfies the energy requirements of short grbs in case of a moderate amount of collimation of the ultrarelativistic bipolar outflows into a fraction @xmath48 of a few per cent of the sky ( e.g. , rosswog & ramirez - ruiz 2003 ) .",
    "our results for the post - merging accretion of a remnant bh - torus system are therefore more optimistic than the estimates based on ns+ns merger simulations by rosswog & ramirez - ruiz ( 2002 ) .",
    "future simulations , however , will have to show whether the deposited thermal energy can be efficiently converted to axial outflows from bh - torus systems that are sufficiently luminous and collimated to account for short grbs ( aloy , janka & mller , in preparation ) .",
