    "near the onset of the hopf bifurcation in continuous media , a complex amplitude of distributed oscillators is described by a normal form equation called the complex ginzburg - landau ( cgl ) equation .",
    "some exact solutions of the 1 + 1 dimensional cgl equation are known as hole , solitary - wave and shock solutions @xcite . in the 2 + 1 dimensional space",
    ", numerical studies showed existence of interesting solutions describing target patterns and spiral patterns @xcite .",
    "however , explicit and exact solutions representing target patterns or spiral patterns have not been constructed yet .    here",
    "we consider a system of oscillators which undergo the hopf bifurcation on a two dimensional lattice instead of continuous media .",
    "each oscillator is governed by the normal form equation of the hopf bifurcation @xcite and couples diffusively and dispersively with its nearest - neighbor oscillators so that the system becomes a spatially discretized version of the 2 + 1 dimensional cgl ( discrete cgl ) equation@xcite .",
    "such a discrete cgl equation has also been studied on a network in connection with @xcite . in this paper , we show that the discrete cgl equation has exact solutions describing various phase patterns consisting of target patterns and spiral patterns . each spiral pattern solution needs a defect in its origin of spiral , where oscillators are absent",
    ". this defect may corresponds to the singularity of the origin in a spiral solution in continuous media . in the other hand ,",
    "target pattern solutions do not have any defects .",
    "we derive the stability condition of the exact solutions to modulational perturbations and conduct some numerical simulations to confirm the stability criterion .",
    "similar phase pattern solutions are constructed to a system of van der pol s oscillators .",
    "let us consider the following system of normal form oscillators to the hopf bifurcation on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "@xmath0 where @xmath1 are complex amplitudes of oscillators and @xmath2 are real constants ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are assumed to be positive ( the subcritical bifurcation ) and @xmath5 denotes summation over nearest - neighbor oscillators at site @xmath6 . through this summation term , each oscillator has diffusive ( @xmath7 ) and dispersive ( @xmath8 ) interactions with its nearest - neighbors . here",
    ", we call eq.([eq:1 ] ) a discrete cgl equation .    by changing variables @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 , and replacing coefficients as @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , eq.([eq:1 ] )",
    "is transformed into @xmath15 or @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "we use eq.([eq:2 ] ) or eq.([eq:3 ] ) as a basic system in this paper .",
    "in this section , we derive some exact solutions of the discrete cgl equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) , which represent a target pattern , a spiral pattern and various mixtures of those patterns .",
    "a crucial step to find exact solutions is to assume @xmath18 then , eq . ( [ eq:3 ] ) takes the same equation for all @xmath6 : @xmath19 we choose an equilibrium solution of eq.([eq:5 ] ) .",
    "@xmath20 where @xmath21 are real constants satisfying @xmath22 and a functional form of the phase @xmath23 with respect to @xmath6 is determined later . because of @xmath24 , we need @xmath25 since @xmath17 , the condition ( [ cond1 ] ) is automatically satisfied for @xmath26 ( negative diffusion or diffusionless case ) .",
    "the solution ( [ eq:6 ] ) has the same amplitude @xmath27 at all cites but its phase could vary from site to site .",
    "the variation of the phase must be determined so that eq.([eq:4 ] ) is satisfied .",
    "@xmath28 we consider a case that there are only two values for @xmath29 , that is , @xmath30 or @xmath31 . at every site , we set phase values of two oscillators among four nearest - neighbor oscillators as @xmath30 , while the other two phases are chosen to be @xmath31",
    ". then , the condition ( [ eq:7 ] ) is fulfilled at all sites , that is , @xmath32 this choice of phase values is quite simple but produces a variety of phase patterns such as stripe patterns and target patterns as exact solutions .",
    "we can construct not only a single target pattern but also a combined pattern of some target patterns as shown in fig.1 .",
    "although we present only a combined pattern of four target patterns , combined patterns of more or less target patterns are also possible .",
    "we can construct various combined patterns of target patterns indefinitely if the system size becomes larger .",
    "when the lattice has a defect , that is , an oscillator is absent at a site , we should modify the above discussion for four oscillators around a defect . to four oscillators around a defect , the coupling terms in eq.([eq:2 ] ) are changed to @xmath33 where @xmath6 indicates one of the four oscillators and the summation term in eq.([eq:3 ] ) becomes @xmath34 thus , eq.([eq:7 ] ) is modified for each @xmath6-th oscillator around a defect as @xmath35 comparing eq.([eq:7 m ] ) to eq.([eq:7 ] ) , the term @xmath36 in ( [ eq:7 m ] ) appears replacing the term which comes from an oscillator at a defect site .",
    "therefore , for the @xmath6-th oscillator around a defect , the defect behaves as a mirror , that is , the defect acts as if it is an oscillator with the same phase as the @xmath6-th phase . owing to this flexible property of a defect",
    ", we can construct spiral patterns with @xmath37 arms around @xmath38 combined defects .",
    "for example , we obtain a spiral pattern with two arms around a single defect ( @xmath39 ) and a spiral pattern with four arms around four combined defects ( @xmath40 ) as shown in fig.2 and fig.4 , respectively .",
    "two separated defects produce two spiral patterns with the same or opposite rotation directions as shown in fig.3 .",
    "we can also construct various patterns in which spirals and targets are concurrent and show one of the simplest examples in fig.2 . on a large enough lattice",
    ", we could construct virtually an indefinite number of such spiral and target patterns .",

    "let us investigate a linear stability of the exact solution : @xmath42 substituting a perturbed solution @xmath43 into eq.([eq:3 ] ) , we have @xmath44 as @xmath45 or @xmath31 , the coefficient of the third term in the rhs of eq.([eq:8 ] ) becomes @xmath46 $ ] , which does not depend on a site number @xmath6 .",
