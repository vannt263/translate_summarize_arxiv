    "argument cates and deutsch ( cd)@xcite argued that the number of degrees of freedom lost for a typical ring due to its topological interactions with neighbouring rings increases like @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an unknown exponent . this free energy term , which favors decreasing the ring size , has to be balanced by the entropy penalty for squashing a ring . to be specific ,",
    "this penalty was assumed to be the same as for a gaussian chain . adding these contributions and minimising over @xmath12 yields the flory exponent @xmath13 .",
    "the simplest possible estimate for @xmath11 is to say that that roughly one degree of freedom is lost for each of the  neighbours which the ring is prevented from threading , i.e. @xmath14 and hence @xmath15 .",
    "this is very close to the value @xmath16 found by us in our previous study @xcite .",
    "note that the overlap number @xmath17 increases extremely weakly and that the only intrinsic length scale in the cd picture is the ring size @xmath6 itself ( possibly renormalised in terms of excluded volume blobs of size @xmath2 ) .",
    "again this was found to be qualitatively in good agreement with the simulations reported in our first paper  @xcite . from the cd picture one",
    "expects a similar density crossover scaling for rings as for linear chains : the ring size @xmath18 reduced by the ring size @xmath19 of the dilute reference ring should scale with @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the crossover density . having focused in ref .",
    "@xcite on _ flexible _ rings at one fixed density we were unable to verify this implicit scaling assumption of the cd picture .",
    "a different picture comes from the extensive studies on ( isolated ) ring polymers in gels ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sketchtop ]  ( b ) ) , often modelled by so - called _ lattice animals _",
    "( la ) , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketchtop ]  ( c ) @xcite .",
    "if the ring size @xmath6 becomes larger than the typical distance  between the fixed topological obstacles ( represented as squares in the figure ) the rings are forced to retrace their paths and the fractal dimension @xmath22 becomes that of a strongly branched object .",
    "the question is now if it is possible to use this well - understood model _ via _ a standard mean - field argument also for strongly overlapping systems of rings in their own melt .",
    "are the surrounding rings able to generate ( in a self - consistent manner ) around a reference ring a fixed mesh of topological obstacles ? and if so , is @xmath23  then la and cd picture would be indistinguishable from the scaling point of view  or does it introduce an additional ring length independent scale ? in the latter case , obviously , the above mentioned density crossover scaling would not work .",
    "( however , one can strictly only expect this la picture to hold in the high entanglement limit . ) in any case , there is a catch : while increasing @xmath24 , @xmath25 being the persistence length , the effective exponent @xmath26 is supposed to drop down to @xmath27 ( and even down to @xmath28 for an ideal gaussian la within an intermediate range of ring sizes @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the la picture might not be self - consistent as already stressed in ref .",
    "it is crucially the prefactor @xmath29 ( and not the inefficient @xmath30 ) which allows the simulator to control the overlap .",
    "( this assumes that the persistence length only weakly affects the hypothetical length  which has to be checked _ a posteriori_. ) .",
    "this is the route we have taken in this study to test the scaling predictions ( rather than the variation in density @xmath9 which we plan to investigate in a subsequent study@xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the persistence length @xmath25 turns out to be a very efficient way to vary the overlap number   ( additional computational overhead and reduced diffusion constants taken into account ) compared to the ring mass ( which we have however increased from @xmath31 to @xmath3 ) .",
    "this allows us to more severely put a test on the scaling predictions of the cd scenario than we were able in our previous study @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that work , the new evidence presented here shows the emergence of ( at least ) one further length scale alongside @xmath6 which we identify with .",
    "tentatively , our data are consistent with a broad crossover towards the la picture in the limit of high chain overlap which is attained by increasing @xmath25 so that the chains become more extended ( though more compact in the scaling sense of smaller @xmath32 ) . a typical semi - flexible coil at higher overlap is presented in fig .  [ fig : snap ] on the right . of course",
    ", the cd and la pictures are not necessarily contradictory in that they might provide useful heuristic descriptions in different overlap limits . in the computationally important regime ( depending on @xmath25 ) where the rings expel successfully neighbouring chains and form relatively dense coils , the mean - field assumption of the la approach has to break down .",
    "a typical chain for low overlap is shown fig .",
    "[ fig : snap ] on the left .",
    "the cd picture is _ a priori _ a good candidate to describe this regime where overlap  and topological interactions are weak .",
    "a possible choice for the unknown cd exponent in this regime is the limiting case @xmath33 and , hence , @xmath34 , i.e. the topological constraints mainly contribute _ logarithmic _ corrections to a closed @xcite gaussian chains of blobs .",

    "we conclude with a summary of our results .",
    "as in our previous study we investigate the properties of unknotted and unconcatenated rings in the framework of the bond fluctuation model ( bfm)@xcite .",
    "many static and dynamic properties of linear chains are known for this computationally efficient , coarse grained lattice model .",
    "a small number of chemical repeat units is mapped onto a lattice monomer such that the relevant characteristics of polymers  excluded volume and connectivity  are retained .",
    "each monomer blocks a unit cell of the three dimensional cubic lattice from further occupancy .",
    "adjacent monomers along a polymer are connected via one of 108 allowed bond vectors of lengths @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "here and in the following all spatial distances are measured in units of the lattice spacing .",
    "this set of bonds allows for 87 different bond angles and , hence , results in a good approximation to chains in continuous space .",
    "the bond vectors are chosen such that the local excluded volume interactions prevent the rings from crossing each other during their motion .",
    "this conservation of the topology ensures that the rings remain neither knotted with themselves nor concatenated with one another during the course of the simulation .",
    "we evolve the ring conformations _ via _ random local monomer displacements .",
    "as explained in the introduction , a crucial parameter is the overlap number , which increases only very weakly with @xmath8 , but much more strongly with the persistence length . in order to tune the persistence length ,",
    "we impose a simple intramolecular potential which favours straight bond angles : @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 denotes the complementary angle between two successive bonds and @xmath39 the dimensionless energy scale ( setting @xmath40 ) .",
    "this potential has been used and investigated in various studies on linear polymer chains at filling fraction @xmath41 of occupied lattice sites @xcite .",
    "this is of importance because it is reasonable to assume that on short length scales ( for long enough chains ) neither ring closure nor topological constraints are pertinent .",
    "this statement will be corroborated later in section [ sec : densestatics ] when we discuss the local ring structure ( fig .",
    "[ fig : df ] ) . note for now that other local quantities like the mean bond length @xmath42 , ( i.e. the mean stiffness energy per monomer ) or the acceptance rate @xmath43 are identical for rings and their linear counterparts . hence , one expects to find the same local rigidity @xmath44 for rings as for linear chains where @xmath45 is easily obtained from the mean - square end - to - end vector  and the known flory exponent of linear chains .",

    "not surprisingly the quantities featured in tab .  [",
    "tab : dilutesigma ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : densesigma ] depend somewhat on the volume fraction @xcite .",
    "note that at the density @xmath41 of occupied lattice sites , many static and dynamic features of _ molten _ linear polymer materials are reproduced by the bfm .",
    "for example , the single chain conformations obey gaussian statistics down to the screening length @xmath47 of the excluded volume interaction obtained by the static structure factor @xcite .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to values @xmath48 because we found tentative evidence for the onset of a nematic order at values @xmath49 . due to",
    "the lower conformational entropy rings tend to order nematically at lower stiffnesses than linear molecules .",
    "( for linear chains an isotropic to nematic transition is found close to @xmath50 @xcite . )",
    "moreover , increasing the stiffness also decrease the number of statistically independent segments , and we want to keep finite @xmath8 effects low , even for small ring lengths .    the algorithm described above has been implemented on a massively parallel cray t3e computer@xcite . using a 2 dimensional geometric decomposition of the simulation grid of linear extension @xmath51 , we employ 64 t3e processors .",
    "the simulations involve about @xmath52 hours of single processor cpu time .    as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : dense ] , this allows us to investigate ring systems with 131072 monomers and chain masses up to @xmath3 .",
    "the data for flexible rings have been used as starting configurations for simulations at higher persistence length . in most cases rings diffused at least a spatial distance of their radius of gyration before any conformational data were collected .",
    "the simulation runs were extended up to five times the relaxation time for sampling the ring conformations .",
    "note that we could not meet this stringent criterion for the semi - flexible ( @xmath53 ) systems at our largest mass @xmath3 .",
    "the resulting data appear to be time independent , and we presume them to be equilibrated , but they have not diffused over a radius of gyration . these three data points ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) have to be taken with care .    as can be deduced from tab .",

    "we have checked for ( the remaining ) finite size effects ( not shown ) : the ( negative ) curvature in the data points is surprisingly weak and _ similar _ for linear chains and rings .",
    "it is slightly stronger for the radius of gyration than for the diameter which probes larger distances . while we can not rule out that the asymptotic exponents of the ring chains are slightly different from their linear counterparts , for all practical purposes of relevance here",
    "we may conclude that neither the ring - closure nor the non - selfknottedness constraint are pertinent .",
    "we are now in the position to rescale the effects of the persistence length for both linear chains and rings by estimating for the linear chain the number  of correlated monomers along the chain and the associated kuhn length @xmath73 ( @xmath42 being the measured mean length of the bfm bond ) . rewriting @xmath74 yields @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "obviously this scaling - based definition of  and   is arbitrary to within prefactors of order one .",

    "note that this scaling and the ( supposed ) exponential decay is sometimes preferred to define the number of correlated monomers  and the persistence length  rather than our definition based on the measured effective bond length @xmath25 and the well - known ( and for rings confirmed ) flory exponent .",
    "however , the correlation function for dilute chains ( both linear and rings ) does certainly _ not _ decrease as a pure exponential ( not shown ) .",

    "we note a weak @xmath39-dependence due bfm related lattice effects : a slightly different set of bond vectors is preferred .",

    "note that the curves for linear dilute chains ( not included ) are very similar .",
    "the only qualitative difference is the  hump \" between the plateau and the guinier regime .",
    "it is due partially to the ring closure as one can easily see by calculating the static structure factor for a gaussian ring ( solid line ) .",
    "while dilute rings essentially behave like their linear counterparts , this becomes very different for unconcatenated rings in the melt .",
    "this is shown in the dramatic decrease of the chain size of rings ( full symbols ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsn ] as compared with dilute reference rings ( open symbols ) .",
    "certainly , linear chain sizes also decrease with increasing density due to the screening of the excluded volume correlations @xcite , but to nowhere near this extent , as fig .",

    "[ tab : densesigma ] . ) for flexible rings ( @xmath95 ) the data points ( for @xmath96 to @xmath3 ) are fitted by an ( effective ) exponent @xmath97 . for our stiffest rings",
    "we observe @xmath98 .",
    "this last result is indeed consistent with the compact la scaling behaviour predicted for rings at high enough overlap .",
    "these results are also in agreement with the density distribution of a ring around its center of mass , shown for rings in fig .",
    "[ fig : gr ] .",
    "we see that for flexible rings ( main figure ) the overlap @xmath99 must be very small ; nearly all monomers from neighbouring rings are expelled . from the flory exponent @xmath100 measured above one expects the density inside the ring to decrease as @xmath101 .",
    "this is confirmed . in the inset we present the corresponding plot for semi - flexible rings ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "since the effective flory exponent is @xmath103 we expect the density inside the ring to be independent of the ring size .",
    "the ring length independence of the density is observed for @xmath104 for @xmath105 ( not shown ) and @xmath106 for @xmath102 .",
    "this supports the idea that the la regime is reached earlier for stiffer rings .",
    "though rings in this regime show compact scaling ( @xmath107 ) the asymptotically constant density @xmath108 is fairly small .",
    "thus the density of _ other _ rings in the correlation hole of a given ring is _ larger _ for stiff than for flexible rings ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gr ] ) .",
    "this holds for the ring sizes studied ; it does not exclude similar strong overlap behaviour for flexible , but much larger rings .",
    "we have to stress , however , that the above exponents are only _ effective _ exponents .",
    "the curves are strongly ( negatively ) curved as one can easily visualise by plotting @xmath109 versus @xmath8 ( not shown ) .",
    "alternatively , one can characterise this curvature _ via _ the differential flory exponent @xmath110 defined from the increase between chain length @xmath8 and @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "this reveals ( not shown ) that @xmath110 decreases continuously from @xmath34 , i.e. nearly gaussian behaviour , for smaller rings down to the slopes indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsn ] for the largest masses we were able to simulate . in our previous study",
    "@xcite we have attributed the observed curvature to classical finite - size effects which also appear for linear chains .",
    "that is , we have not attributed them to topological effects , but excluded volume interactions visible due to the finite number of blobs . if one admits this as the _ only _ physical origin of the curvature ( excluding , e.g. , additional length scales ) it is indeed reasonable to attempt to obtain the asymptotic exponent by classical finite - size extrapolation method . in this method ,",
    "the local slope @xmath110 ( obtained from the diameter and the radius of gyration ) is plotted versus the reduced blob size @xmath112 where @xmath6 is itself given in a self - consistent manner by the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "this works generally well for linear polymers . proceeding along these lines we obtained an asymptotic exponent of @xmath113 ( which we now obtain directly after including @xmath3 ) .",
    "this value happened to coincide with the cd picture ( @xmath14 @xcite ) which made us perhaps more confident than we should have been ( in ref.@xcite ) of having characterised the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the excluded volume effects ( and their screening ) do certainly contribute to the general crossover scenario .",
    "this is shown below when we discuss the structure factor ( fig .",
    "[ fig : df ] ) . but a danger remains that we may have missed additional physics , in the form of an additional length scale ( not included in the simple cd picture ) , which controls the behavior of molten rings .",
    "thus one of the key claims made in ref .",
    "@xcite was that the only relevant length scale in dense rings is the chain size itself .",
    "this was shown in various scaling plots , e.g. , of the reduced mean ring",
    " area \" @xmath114 .",
    "the area @xmath115 is defined as a signed quantity ( the component in that direction of the vector area of a ring ) that vanishes for any configuration in which the ring exactly retraces its own steps .",
    "qualitatively , one expects that a ring which is only very weakly threaded by the surrounding rings has a very small area .",
    "this should hold in particular while we approach the la limit .",
    "the reduced area @xmath116 has been ( log - linear ) plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : an ] versus ring mass @xmath8 for dilute rings ( empty symbols ) and rings in the melt ( full symbols ) of different flexibility . for ( long enough )",
    "_ dilute _ rings the ratio is indeed chain length ( and persistence length ) independent . for the dense limit",
    "however , we now find evidence for ( logarithmic ) corrections to the expected cd scaling ( plateau ) .",
    "the reduced area decreases systematically as a function of mass  this is in contrast to what was deduced from a ( linear - linear ) plot in ref .",
    "note that the ratio decreases also with respect to @xmath39 : stiffer rings are likely to get less threaded by other rings .",
    "this is consistent with the la picture where stiffer ( and hence larger ) rings are forced to retrace their own steps in a network of fixed obstacles .",
    "more stringent tests for the cd picture are posed by the following two scaling analyses which try to allow for a varying persistence length under the assumption of no new additional length scale for topological interactions .",
    "they are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rkg ] and in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] . in the first we replot the reduced ring size @xmath77 versus the number of statistical units @xmath78 as we did in section  [ sec : diluterings ] for dilute rings .",
    "the values of  and  used in the fig .",
    "[ fig : rkg ] for the dense linear chains and rings are the same as for the dilute systems @xcite .",
    "the difference to the behaviour of linear chains is striking : the ring data for different @xmath39-lines _ diverges _ while the linear chain data clearly collapses ( on the expected slope @xmath117 ) .",
    "this is a physically unsound result ; flexibility - dependent universality classes for rings are difficult to accept .",
    "the second scaling test is the  classic \" @xmath118 versus @xmath119 mentioned in the introduction @xcite .",
    "this is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] .",
    "both ring diameter ( full symbols ) and radius of gyration ( empty symbols ) at @xmath41 have been included . as reference chain size @xmath19 we used the measured radius of gyration for a dilute ring of given @xmath39 .",
    "again , the scaling attempt fails to account for data of more than one chain stiffness .    for the moment",
    "we may conclude that there is clear evidence for one or more additional length scales . at this point , we still do not know how this hypothetical length scale depends on ring and persistence lengths , nor do we know what physics it represents : however , since it arises for rings and not for linear chains , we can presume a topological origin .",
    "another striking effect which we are able to see due to the persistence length variation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eiej ] for the bond - bond correlation function of dense rings . as before for dilute chains",
    "this correlation function becomes chain length independent for the large masses indicated in the figure .",
    "for flexible rings the correlation function drops down slightly below zero within three monomers and approaches then zero from below .",
    "when the persistence length is increased a most remarkable negative correlation becomes visible indicating that the polymer is likely to fold back after 10 monomers for ( @xmath102)@xcite .",
    "needless to say that the correlation function for dilute rings does not show anything faintly similar .",
    "the position and the depth of this anti - correlation dip increases with @xmath39 .",
    "we stress that the position and the shape of the dip are chain length independent .",
    "if this effect has something to do with the additional length scale  mentioned above , as we believe , this is a piece of evidence for its chain length independence .",
    "this observation forms the basis for the next scaling proposal attempted in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] .",
    "we assume here that there is one additional , mass independent length scale .",
    "hence , the associated number  of monomers between the topological obstacles is also mass independent , but depends on the local conformational properties .",
    "these are complicated as will be revealed below ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : df ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : rn ] ) .",
    "however , as we have observed above ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rsn ] ) , short rings are reasonable approximated by gaussian statistics and we may write @xmath120 , where @xmath121 is some effective exponent close to @xmath122 characterising the ( messy ) statistics at distances @xmath123 .",
    "we want to plot @xmath124 versus @xmath125 where @xmath6 denotes either the diameter ( full symbols ) or the radius of gyration ( empty symbols ) .",
    "we still need to fix the persistence length dependence of . for simplicity",

    "hence , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "this assumes that the effect of @xmath39 is to increase @xmath129 ( allowing the asymptotic regime to be accessed for smaller @xmath8 ) by increasing @xmath6 at ( nearly ) constant .",
    "this idea is very much the opposite of what we tried in fig .",
    "[ fig : rkg ] where we had @xmath78 and stiffer chains with fewer statistical units were considered as being effectively  shorter \" . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uv ] this simple new proposal is successful although a weak dependence of  on @xmath39 can not be ruled out .",
    "moreover , it is self - consistent : the local statistics is indeed well described by the gaussian behaviour @xmath130 .",
    "this might be interpreted as the @xmath33 limit of the cd proposal .",
    "the data collapse over two orders of magnitude in @xmath131 justifies _ a posteriori _ the neglect of a stiffness dependence of . at large distances data points for",
    "_ different _ persistence lengths fall together on one slope of @xmath132 which is consistent with the la picture .",
    "note the later crossover of the radius of gyration onto the @xmath133-slope .",
    "this might be related to the fact that  probes smaller distances .",

    "note that both curves correspond to roughly the same time period _ and _ the same mean value of the monomer displacement .",
    "the center of mass diffusion constant differs , however , by an order of magnitude .",
    "hence , the major difference in the dynamic behaviour does not stem from a difference in the local dynamics ( e.g.  a slight decrease of the acceptance ratio of the monte carlo moves due to the additional bond angle potential ) , but reflects the interplay between conformations / topology and the dynamics .",
    "notably , the monomer mean square displacements for flexible rings are gaussian distributed , while the distribution of semi - flexible systems is non - gaussian .",
