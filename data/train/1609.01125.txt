    "the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) survey of the inner galaxy @xcite has discovered a large number of very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath4 100 gev ) sources .",
    "about half of them have been firmly identified as supernova remnants ( snrs ) and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) .",
    "however , there is still a significant fraction of vhe sources that has not been identified due to the lack of counterparts in the radio / x - ray or gev @xmath0-ray band @xcite .",
    "therefore , searching for the counterparts of these unidentified vhe sources in longer wavelength bands is very helpful to identify and classify them . in the gev band , more than seven years survey data from the fermi large area telescope ( fermi - lat ) provides a good opportunity to hunt for the unidentified vhe sources . indeed ,",
    "several unidentified vhe sources have been detected with the fermi - lat data @xcite .",
    "hess j1427 - 608 is one of the unidentified vhe sources discovered by the hess galactic plane survey @xcite .",
    "the tev image shows that it is only slightly extended with a symmetric gaussian function with width of @xmath5 = @xmath6 .",
    "this source is detected with an integral flux above 1 tev of @xmath7 = @xmath8 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 and a power - law spectrum with an index of @xmath11 = 2.16 .",
    "no nearby snr or pulsar was detected in the vicinity of hess j1427 - 608 @xcite .",
    "the x - ray counterpart of it , suzaku j1427 - 6051 , was reported by @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spatial morphology is clearly extended with a gaussian width of @xmath5 = @xmath12 and the spectrum is well fitted by a power - law with an index of @xmath11 = @xmath13 , implying non - thermal x - ray continuum emission . the unabsorbed flux in the 2 - 10 kev band is @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite has discussed the possible nature of hess j1427 - 608 as a pwn or non - thermal snr .",
    "each one can explain some of the observational facts but face difficulties .",
    "no radio counterpart was detected in the direction of hess j1427 - 608 . in the second fermi - lat catalog ( 2fgl ;",
    "* ) , a gev source , 2fgl j1427.6 - 6048c , which is located in the vicinity of hess j1427 - 608 , was reported .",

    "furthermore , the power - law spectrum index of 2fgl j1427.6 - 6048c is @xmath11 = 2.7 @xcite , which can not connect with the tev spectrum of hess j1427 - 608 well .",
    "it is very likely that 2fgl j1427.6 - 6048c is not associated with hess j1427 - 608 .",
    "meanwhile , it should be noted that no source in the third fermi - lat source catalog ( 3fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is associated with 2fgl j1427.6 - 6048c .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out a complete analysis of this region using more than 7 years fermi - lat pass 8 data to investigate the @xmath0-ray emission of hess j1427 - 608 . in section 2",
    ", we describe the data analysis and results , including the spatial , spectral and timing analysis .",
    "the possible nature of hess j1427 - 608 based on the multi - wavelength spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting is discussed in section 3 and the conclusion of this work is presented in section 4 .",
    "the following analysis is performed using the latest fermi - lat pass 8 data with _ source _ event class from august 4 , 2008 ( mission elapsed time 239557418 ) to november 4 , 2015 ( mission elapsed time 468288004 ) .",
    "considering the impact of point spread function ( psf ) and the complex diffuse emission from the galactic plane , we only select events with energies between 3 gev and 500 gev .",
    "furthermore , in order to reduce the contamination from the earth limb , the events with zenith angles larger than @xmath15 are excluded .",
    "the region of interest ( roi ) we analyse is a @xmath16 square region centered at the position of hess j1427 - 608 ( r.a.@xmath17 , dec.@xmath18 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we analyse the data using the fermi _ sciencetools _ version v10r0p5 and the instrument response function ( irf ) of p8r2_source_v6 . to model the galactic diffuse emission and isotropic diffuse background , gll_iem_v06.fits and iso_p8r2_source_v6_v06.txt are adopted .",
    "in addition to the diffuse backgrounds , the sources included in the 3fgl and located within the roi are added to the model to account for @xmath0-ray emission . in the following analysis , the standard binned likelihood method with gtlike",
    "is applied .      in each gtlike run , the normalizations and spectral parameters of sources with distance smaller than @xmath19 to hess j1427 - 608 , as well as the normalizations of the two diffuse backgrounds , are left free during the fitting . after including in the sky model the emission from 3fgl sources and the two diffuse backgrounds , we create a @xmath20 test statistic ( ts ) map centered at hess j1427 - 608 with gttsmap , as shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : tsmap ] . as can be seen from this ts map",
    ", there are still some significant excesses ( marked by green crosses ) that are not included in the model .",
    "specially , there are some complicated excesses to the west of the roi center , which we mark as new source a and b. these excesses are spatially consistent with the two `` wings '' of the kookaburra complex ( hess j1420 - 607 & hess j1418 - 609 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the two  wings \" are two extended @xmath0-ray sources and argued to be pwn candidates by @xcite . @xcite",
    "explored high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from these two sources with fermi - lat and concluded that hess j1420 - 607 was a pwn candidate , and the emission from hess j1418 - 609 was dominated by a pulsar .",
    "besides the new source a and b , we find an significant excess at the roi center , the position of hess j1427 - 608 .",
    "this source , referred as source t , is the focus of this work .",
    "those three new sources are added in the model as point sources with power - law spectra .",
    "their accurate positions are obtained with gtfindsrc command .",
    "the resulting coordinates and ts values of them are listed in table [ table : newpts ] .",

    ", this ts map is relatively clean with only small residuals .",

    "the distance between source t and the central position of hess j1427 - 608 is only @xmath26 , within the @xmath24 error circle of the fermi - lat data . to better understand the spatial correlation between source t and hess j1427 - 608 , as well as candidate counterparts in other wavelengths ,",

    "[ fig : tsmap2 ] , source t is well coincident with hess j1427 - 608 and suzaku j1427 - 6051 .",

    "the spectral indices of protons and electrons are set equal to 2.0 in view of the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism and the magnetic field strength is adopted to be a typical value of @xmath28 @xmath3 g to reduce the number of free parameters in the model .",
    "based on this , a cutoff energy of @xmath29 tev and total energy above 1 gev of @xmath30 for electrons are needed to explain the flux in radio and x - ray band .",
    "the total energy of protons above 1 gev is @xmath31 .",
    "however , this parameter strongly depends on the values of gas density and distance adopted here .",
    "since there is no evident cutoff in the photon spectrum in the tev energy band , the cutoff energy of protons should be larger than @xmath32 tev for the @xmath0-ray spectra with an index of 2.0 obtained above . for comparison ,",

    "hess j1427 - 608 is a good candidate to accelerate cr protons up to several hundreds tev or even pev energies .",
    "this is a good opportunity for the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) to test the pevatron nature of hess j1427 - 608 .",
    "note that for a distance of 8 kpc , the pair production absorption of the vhe photons by the infrared and/or cmb photons is non - negligible @xcite , and the extension of the power - law spectrum to pev energies should be treated as an upper limit .    as can be seen in fig .",

    "-ray sed for several of the most prominent snrs and hess j1427 - 608 .",
    "the energy fluxes of several sources with relatively flat spectra are scaled downward by one order of magnitude for the sake of clarity.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    considering that most of the galactic vhe sources are identified to be pwne or snrs , here we discuss these two possibilities as the origin of hess j1427 - 608 .",
    "first , we discuss the possibility that the emission comes from a snr . for comparing between hess j1427 - 608 and several of the most prominent snrs , we plot the @xmath0-ray sed of them in fig .",
    "[ fig : snr - sed ] .",
    "the energy fluxes of several snrs are adjusted for the sake of illustration @xcite , as shown in the legend of fig .",
    "[ fig : snr - sed ] .",
    "as can be seen , these snrs can be divided into three classes . the first class is known to be interacting with molecular clouds , such as ic 443 @xcite , w44 @xcite , w51c @xcite , w28 @xcite , w49b @xcite and ctb 37a @xcite .",
    "these snrs are old and typically brighter in the gev than in the tev band . and the @xmath0-ray emissions of these sources are considered to be from hadronic process .",
    "especially , ic 443 , w44 and w51c have shown the characteristic `` @xmath33 bump '' @xcite , which are considered to be the most direct evidence that protons are accelerated in snrs . differing from this class , the second class , such as rx j1713 - 3946 @xcite , rx j0852 - 4622 @xcite , rcw 86 @xcite , sn1006 @xcite and ctb 37b @xcite , has harder spectra in the gev band and is brighter in the tev band than in the gev band .",
    "the sources in this class are middle - aged snrs and generally thought to have the leptonic origin for the @xmath0-ray emission although several of them are still being debated . the third class in fig .",
    "[ fig : snr - sed ] includes cas a @xcite and tycho @xcite , which are the youngest snrs . and the @xmath0-ray spectra of these two snrs can be fitted by a power law extending from the gev to tev band , which can be well explained as the hadronic emission .",
    "like cas a and tycho , hess j1427 - 608 also has a flat @xmath0-ray spectra from gev to a few tens of tev and can be fitted well by a power law with an index of 2.0 .    for the leptonic scenario of hess j1427 - 608",
    ", we compare the fitted parameters in table [ table : model ] with those the second class mentioned above in fig .",
    "[ fig : snr - sed ] .",
    "and we find that the total energies of electrons of these snrs are in the order of @xmath34 erg and the fitting result of hess j1427 - 608 is also in coincidence with that under the assumption of distance to be 8 kpc .",
    "however , the fitting magnetic field strength of hess j1427 - 608 is at least two times lower than those of other snrs , which may be attributed to variations in the progenitor and its environment .",
    "however , the x - ray flux is dominated by a central bright source instead of a shell structure of other snrs .",
    "the model predicts a sharp cutoff beyond the hess energy range which can be tested with future cta observations . for the hadronic scenario ,",
    "parameters in our model are compared with snrs whose @xmath0-ray emissions are expected to be dominated by @xmath33 decay .",
    "the total energy of protons of hess j1427 - 608 , @xmath35 , is significantly higher than the typical energy of particles , assuming that @xmath36 of the supernova kinetic energy of @xmath37 erg is transferred to the energy of particles . on the one hand",
    ", this source may be left from a hypernova explosion which releases a substantially higher energy than typical supernova .",
    "on the other hand , much higher value of @xmath38 depending on the gas density and the distance means that hess j1427 - 608 may be closer or the ambient environment of this source may be denser . comparing with the first class snrs , also known as snrs interacting with molecular clouds leading to prominent thermal x - ray emissions , the x - ray emission from hess j1427 - 608 is dominant by non - thermal process .",
    "the absence of shell structure in the x - ray band for hess j1427 - 608 and no adjacent snrs or molecular clouds founded around make it distinct from others although several dark clouds are reported near the direction of hess j1427 - 608 in the simbad database .",
    "in addition , the flat @xmath0-ray spectra of hess j1427 - 608 from gev to a few tens of tev is also significantly different from that of the first class snrs but similar to that of the third class snrs , especially tycho , which also emit the non - thermal x - ray emissions . for hess j1427 - 608",
    ", the fitting cutoff energy of @xmath39 tev or even 1 pev for protons is about one order of magnitude higher than the values of most snrs , which suggests that hess j1427 - 608 is a promising pev cr accelerator ( pevatron ) .",
    "however the absence of shell structure in the x - ray band and the weak radio emission are also challenging to this possible origin .",
    "the @xmath0-ray emission from pwne is dominated by the ics process @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed the pwn hypothesis of hess j1427 - 608 with the x - ray and tev data , and indicated that a simple one - zone model with magnetic filed strength of about 5 @xmath3 g would roughly explain the sed , and our result is consistent with that .",
    "our gev data , in combination with the flux upper limit in the radio band , however , favors a more complex broken power - law model .",
    "in addition , @xcite also modelled the multi - wavelength data of hess j1427 - 608 as a pwn .",
    "the fitting parameters of the leptonic scenario listed in table [ table : model ] are comparable with that of pwn vela - x @xcite .",
    "the x - ray , gev and tev luminosities of hess j1427 - 608 are @xmath40 = @xmath41 erg s@xmath10 , @xmath42 = @xmath43 erg s@xmath10 , and @xmath44 = @xmath45 erg s@xmath10 @xcite , respectively .",
    "these estimated luminosities are within the value range of known pwne or pwn candidates which have emissions in the x - ray and @xmath0-ray bands @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the x - ray and @xmath0-ray luminosities is approximately to be 1 , which is consistent with the value of magnetic field strength in our fitting and the value of about 5 @xmath3 g is also typical for pwne . @xcite and @xcite studied a large sample of pwne and derived the relations among @xmath46 , @xmath47 , spin - down energy  and characteristic age @xmath48 of the pulsars .",
    "the ratio between the gev and x - ray luminosities of hess j1427 - 608 is estimated to be about 7.44 , and according to these relations in @xcite and @xcite , the value of  and @xmath48 of a pulsar to power hess j1427 - 608 are suggested to be @xmath49 erg s@xmath10 and 11 kyr , respectively .",
    "the values of  and @xmath48 are typical for vela - like pulsars .    for the pwn hypothesis",
    ", the discussion above indicates that there may exist a vela - like pulsar in the vicinity of hess j1427 - 608 .",
    "the detection of a pulsar near hess j1427 - 608 will strongly support such a scenario .",
    "therefore , the future observations , especially the pulsation search in the radio and other energy bands , are of great importance to address this hypothesis .",
    "we investigate more than seven years data of the fermi - lat in the direction of the unidentified tev source hess j1427 - 608 .",
    "a point source is detected with a significance of @xmath21 .",
    "this gev source is positionally coincident with hess j1427 - 608 , and the gev spectrum can connect with the tev spectrum smoothly .",
    "these facts suggest that this source is very likely the gev counterpart of hess j1427 - 608 .",
    "we collect multi - wavelength data to constrain the radiation model of hess j1427 - 608 .",
    "both the leptonic and hadronic scenarios can fit the sed . at present",
    "it is difficult to exclude either one considering the large uncertainties of the data .",
    "a remarkable spectral feature of this source is its @xmath50 spectrum over four decades of energies without obvious cutoff .",
    "this is unique among all currently detected @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "if cr protons are responsible for the @xmath0-ray emission , the highest energy of protons should exceed a few hundred tev and even pev .",
    "this makes hess j1427 - 608 a promising pev cr accelerator ( pevatron ) .",
    "unfortunately , the nature of hess j1427 - 608 is not clear yet . either a snr or a pwn seems to be plausible .",
    "the low strength of magnetic field and the absence of shell structure in the x - ray band indicate that hess j1427 - 608 may be a pwn rather than a snr . however , its flat @xmath0-ray spectrum in a wide energy range is more close to some snrs but different from typical pwne .",
    "further multi - wavelength observations , in the radio and vhe @xmath0-rays , are crucial to understand its nature ultimately . especially the precise measurements of the @xmath0-ray energy spectrum up to hundreds of tev energies by , e.g. , the cta , will crucially test its pevatron nature .",

    "<S> can be well fitted by a single power - law function with an index of 2.0 , without obvious indication of spectral cutoff toward high energies . </S>",
    "<S> such a result implies that hess j1427 - 608 may be a pev particle accelerator . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible nature of hess j1427 - 608 according to the multi - wavelength spectral fittings . given the relatively large errors , either a leptonic or a hadronic model can explain the multi - wavelength data from radio to vhe @xmath0-rays . the inferred magnetic field strength is a few @xmath3 g , which is smaller than typical values of supernova remnants ( snrs ) , and is consistent with some pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the flat @xmath0-ray spectrum is slightly different from typical pwne but similar to that of some known snrs . </S>"
