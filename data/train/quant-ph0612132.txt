    "among the main differences between quantum and classical information is the fundamental impossibility to exactly duplicate an unknown quantum state .",
    "this was established by the no - cloning theorem of dieks @xcite and wootters and zurek @xcite ; for a review , see ref . @xcite .",
    "while _ exact _",
    "cloning is thus impossible , it remains an important goal to _ approximately _ clone quantum states .",
    "this possibility , which is particularly important for quantum communication and cryptography , was first discussed by buek and hillery @xcite , who showed that it is possible to create copies ( approximate clones ) of unknown quantum states with a quality that does not depend on the initial state .",
    "approximate cloning can be optimized in different ways . in so - called asymmetric cloning , the amount of information transferred from the input state to the copy is an adjustable parameter .",
    "the quality of the copy and the distortion that the cloning process causes on the original system both depend on this parameter : if the quality of the copy increases , the distortion of the original necessarily increases simultaneously @xcite .",
    "this is quantified by the fidelity of the two output systems , which is defined as the overlap of these states with the input state .",
    "this tradeoff relates , e.g. , the amount of information that an eavesdropper can extract from a quantum communication channel to the error rate of the transmitted information @xcite .",
    "asymmetric quantum cloning was first proposed for copying a single qubit to a single copy qubit @xcite , and subsequently extended to arbitrary dimensions ( including the continuous case ) @xcite .",
    "an implementation of universal asymmetric cloning in an optical experiment was proposed locally @xcite and at a distance @xcite .",
    "an experimental realization of @xmath0 asymmetric cloning was reported by zhao _",
    "et al_. @xcite using two entangled photon pairs .",
    "the quality of the cloning can be improved if the initial state is restricted to part of the full hilbert space .",
    "an example of this state - dependent cloning is phase - covariant cloning @xcite , where the input state is an equal - weight superposition of two basis states .",
    "the goal is then to optimally clone the state in such a way that the phase information is conserved .    in this paper , we construct a two - qubit quantum logic circuit that implements the optimal asymmetric @xmath0 phase - covariant cloning @xcite for arbitrary input phase .",
    "our cloning machine does not require any ancilla qubits and uses only two gate operations .",
    "the cloning process is implemented experimentally in an nmr system , using nuclear - spin qubits . for",
    "the gate operations we use controlled geometrical phase gates and demonstrate the trade - off in fidelity for the two output qubits .",
    "in the following , we consider phase - covariant cloning : the original qubit to be cloned is in an equal - weight superposition of the two basis states , @xmath1 with an unknown phase difference @xmath2 .",
    "we clone this state onto a second qubit that is originally in state @xmath3 .",
    "the cloning is acomplished by a unitary operation acting on the initial product state @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the operation can be specified by its effect on the two orthogonal initial states @xmath5 and @xmath6 : @xmath7 or by its matrix representation @xmath8 this operation is equivalent ( up to local operation and phases ) to @xmath9 , and the rotation angle @xmath10 can be used to adjust how much information is transferred to the second qubit .    , while qubit b is the blank one which initially in state @xmath3 .",
    "the unitary operation @xmath11 denotes @xmath12 and @xmath13 denotes @xmath14.,width=7 ]    after the cloning operation , the partial density operators for the two qubits are @xmath15 @xmath16    the state - overlap between the original and the two output qubits are @xmath17 the choice of the angle @xmath10 thus determines how much information is transferred from qubit a to qubit b : for @xmath18 , the overlap of qubit a with the initial state is 1 , while the overlap of the copy qubit is just the random value @xmath19 .",
    "when @xmath20 , we obtain the case of optical symmetric cloning , with @xmath21 , which has been shown to be the optimal value for symmetric phase - covariant cloning @xcite . for @xmath22 ,",
    "the information is transferred completely to the copy qubit , with @xmath23 .",
    "compared to the logic circuit of the symmetric cloning machine proposed in ref @xcite , this scheme needs fewer logic gates .",
    "we therefore expect it to perform better in practice , being less affected by experimental imperfections , such as errors in rotation angles of radio - frequency pulses .",
    "geometric quantum phases @xcite have the remarkable property that they depend only on global parameters ( e.g. the area of a circuit ) and are therefore not sensitive to some local variations of the trajectory .",
    "it was therefore suggested , that quantum gate operations using geometric gates may be less susceptible to experimental imperfections and therefore yield higher fidelity @xcite    we therefore used geometric phase gates to implement the two controlled gate operations required for the cloning operation ( [ e : un ] ) ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . we first discuss the relevant operation for a single qubit and then extend the procedure to the controlled operations .      within the two - level system , we consider two orthogonal states @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which undergo a cyclic evolution described by the operator @xmath26 : @xmath27 .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 is thus the total phase difference of the two states acquired during this circuit .    in the computational basis ( @xmath3 , @xmath29 )",
    ", the cyclic states can be written as @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the spherical coordinates of the state vector on the bloch sphere .",
    "for an arbitrary input state @xmath33 with @xmath34 , after the cyclic evolution for the @xmath35 state , the output state is @xmath36,where    @xmath37    this operation becomes a purely geometric gate operation if the dynamic contribution to the total phase @xmath28 vanishes .",
    "the cyclic trajectories used in the experiment .",
    "@xmath24 is transported along the path a - b - c - a , and @xmath25 transported along the path a-b-c-a.,width=6 ]    in the experiment , we use a nonadiabatic geometric phase and transform the input states along geodesic circuits on the bloch sphere , as shown in fig .",
    "2 . here , the cyclic states are @xmath38 . for the circuit shown in fig .",
    "2 , the solid angle subtended by the circuit is equal to @xmath10 , the rotation angle during the second part of the circuit .",
    "the geometric phase becomes thus @xmath39 .    for the circuit of fig .",
    "2 , we may substitute the above values for @xmath40 and @xmath28 .",
    "the propagator becomes then @xmath41      we now apply this geometrical gate to controlled operations in a two - qubit system where qubit a is the control qubit , while qubit b undergoes the geometric circuit if qubit a is in state @xmath29 but remains invariant if the control qubit is in state @xmath3 .",

    "if we use a rotating frame with a frequency of @xmath49 , the hamiltonian vanishes for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , while it becomes @xmath52 for @xmath53 .",
    "this hamiltonian generates controlled rotations around the z - axis . to generate the trajectories of fig .",
    "2 , we rotate the rotation axis using radio - frequency pulses . to generate a @xmath54 rotation around the @xmath55-axis , e.g.",
    ", we use the sequence @xmath56 where the notation for the rotations is @xmath57 , and @xmath58 stand for free evolution under the control hamiltonian for the duration @xmath59 . the circuit of fig . 2",
    "is thus generated by the sequence @xmath60    this represents the first gate operation of fig .",
    "1 . for the second operation",
    ", we have to reverse the roles of control and target qubit and apply the following sequence to qubit a : @xmath61 now setting the rf frequency to @xmath62 .",
