    "it was soon noticed that the metric ( [ eq1.1 ] ) has an apparently singular behaviour at the `` schwarzschild radius '' @xmath4 .",
    "for instance , a clock at rest in the metric ( [ eq1.1 ] ) and located at a radius @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) exhibits , when its ticks are `` read '' from infinity via electromagnetic signals , a redshift equal to [ eq1.2 ] = = .",
    "the redshift ( [ eq1.2 ] ) goes to infinity as @xmath7 .",
    "therefore the `` schwarzschild sphere '' @xmath8 has the observable characteristic of being an infinite - redshift surface .",
    "similarly , one finds that the force needed to keep a particle at rest at a radius @xmath6 goes to infinity as @xmath7 .",

    "we hope that this short review has allowed the reader to grasp the richness of the issue of black - hole entropy .",
    "thirty years after the original proposal of bekenstein and the discovery by hawking of the quantum radiance of black holes , the issue remains somewhat cloudy .",
    "string theory has brought very significant progress by allowing one to interpret the microscopic degrees of freedom of certain _ extremal _ ( supersymmetric ) black holes in terms of a sort of `` analytic continuation in the string coupling @xmath254 '' of systems of very massive , ( ramond - ramond ) charged string solitons ( dirichlet branes ) .",
    "however , it is frustrating that the @xmath242-brane description does not apply to the regime of large ( effective ) string coupling @xmath254 where these systems are believed to `` transform into '' black holes . we have sketched the limited progress made in string theory for understanding the microscopic degrees of freedom of _ non extremal _ ( non supersymmetric ) black holes , and , in particular , the simplest schwarzschild ones .",
    "a plausible picture emerged of a reversible transformation between schwarzschild black - hole states ( when @xmath479 ) into self - gravitating massive string states ( when @xmath480 ) .",
    "however , the lack of supersymmetry for such states limits the secure applicability of present string technology to the regime @xmath481 .",
    "the extension of the results to @xmath482 is physically plausible but not technically justified . in addition , all stringy calculations fail to give a precise hilbert - space description of the microscopic structure of black holes in the regime ( @xmath483 , or its bps equivalent ) where the considered `` internal structure '' has become a large , quasi - classical black hole . in particular , the quantum description of the large spacetime region constituting the interior of a quasi - classical black hole ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and of all the excitations it contains ( such as the `` lost '' parts of the hawking particle creation phenomenon ) , remain somewhat mysterious ( see @xcite for a recent attempt at describing the quantum state of a quasi - classical black hole in a unitary way ) . clearly",
    "the issue of black - hole entropy will continue to exercize the sagacity of many researchers for many years to come , and will continue to provide one of our few handles on the physics of quantum relativistic gravity , _ i.e. _ the domain where @xmath484 , @xmath485 and @xmath1 all play important roles .",
    "i wish to thank bertrand duplantier for useful comments , vincent pasquier for bringing wheeler s recollection to my attention , and the kavli institute for theoretical physics for hospitality while this review was completed .",
    "this work was supported in part by the national science foundation under grant no .",
    "phy99 - 07949 .",
    "here is an excerpt from john wheeler s book @xcite about the genesis of the discovery of the concept of black - hole entropy by jacob bekenstein :     one afternoon in 1970 bekenstein  then a graduate student  and i were discussing black - hole physics in my office in princeton s jadwin hall .",
    "i told him the concern i always feel when a hot cup of tea exchanges heat energy with a cold cup of tea . by allowing that transfer of heat i do not alter the energy of the universe , but i do increase its microscopic disorder , its information loss , its entropy .",
    "the entropy of the world always increases in an irreversible process like that .",
    "_ `` the consequence of my crime , jacob , echo down to the end of time , '' _ i noted .",
    "_ `` but if a black hole swims by , and i drop the teacups into it , i conceal from all the world the evidence of my crime .",
    "how remarkable ! '' _",
    "bekenstein , a man of deep integrity , takes the lawfulness of creation as a matter of utmost seriousness .",
    "several months later , he came back with a remarkable idea .",
    "_ `` you do nt destroy entropy when you drop those teacups into the black hole .",
    "the black hole already has entropy , and you only increase it ! '' _",
    "bekenstein went on to explain that the surface area of a black hole is not only analogous to entropy , it is entropy , and the surface gravity of a black hole ( measured , for example , by the downward acceleration of a rock as it crosses the horizon ) is not only analogous to temperature , it is temperature . a black hole is not totally cold ! ...     999 k. schwarzschild , `` on the gravitational field of a masspoint according to einstein s theory '' ( in german ) , _ sitzungsber .",
