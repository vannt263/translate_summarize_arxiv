    "the quantum group @xmath3 is known to admit a coloured extension by introducing some continuously varying colour parameters associated to the generators .",
    "in such an extension , the associated algebra and the coalgebra are defined in a way that all hopf algebraic properties remain preserved .",
    "such extensions have been introduced in @xcite and studied by various authors @xcite in recent years .",
    "however , some of the basic algebro - geometric structure underlying these coloured extensions still needs to be established . as such",
    ", we shall focus on the coloured extension of the most intuitive quantum group @xmath3 .",
    "while some aspects of this example have already been studied from both , the standard @xmath4-deformations as well as the jordanian ( nonstandard ) @xmath5-deformations @xcite , it has only recently been shown @xcite that the contraction procedure could be used to obtain the coloured jordanian quantum groups from their coloured @xmath4-deformed counterparts .",
    "in particular , the coloured extension of @xmath3 was treated in detail in @xcite to obtain a new coloured extension of jordanian @xmath6 .",
    "+ in the present paper , we investigate the algebra dual to the coloured extension of @xmath3 by generalising two well - known approaches to the problem : the ( algebraic ) @xmath2-matrix approach @xcite and the geometric approach @xcite due to sudbery and dobrev .",
    "we first clarify the notion of duality between a coloured quantum group and its dual _ i.e. _ the coloured quantised universal enveloping algebra .",
    "we then generalise the @xmath2-matrix approach to establish duality for the coloured extension of @xmath3 and we obtain a new coloured quantum algebra corresponding to @xmath7 and exhibit its hopf algebra structure .",
    "the coloured @xmath2-matrix procedure naturally leads us to formulate a constructive differential calculus @xcite on the coloured extension of @xmath3 .",
    "+ furthermore , we propose a coloured generalisation of the geometric notion of duality for quantum groups _",
    "i.e. _ regarding the dual algebra as the algebra of tangent vectors at the identity of the group .",
    "this generalisation could also be of significance in establishing the duality for the coloured extension of jordanian quantum groups .",
    "the coloured extension of the quantum group @xmath3 is governed by the coloured @xmath2-matrix @xcite , @xmath9 which is nonadditive _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath10 .",
    "it satisfies the so - called coloured quantum yang - baxter equation @xmath11 which is in general multicomponent and @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are considered as ` colour ' variables .",
    "the @xmath15 relations are also extended to incorporate the coloured extension as @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) in which the entries of the @xmath19 matrices carry colour dependence _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the coproduct and counit for the coalgebra structure are given by @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the quantum determinant @xmath24 is group - like but not central . the antipode is given by @xmath25 and depends on one colour variable at a time .",
    "the full hopf algebraic structure can be constructed resulting in a coloured extension of @xmath3 within the framework of the @xmath26 formalism .",
    "since @xmath12 and @xmath13 are continuous variables , this implies the coloured extension of @xmath3 has an infinite number of generators .",
    "the colourless limit @xmath27 gives back the ordinary single - parameter deformed quantum group @xmath3 , and the monochromatic limit @xmath28 gives rise to the uncoloured two - parameter deformed quantum group @xmath29 .",
    "in this section , we investigate in detail the dual structure for the coloured extension of @xmath3 employing the @xmath2-matrix approach . in doing so , let us denote the generators of the yet unknown dual algebra by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the following pairings hold @xmath32 all other pairings give zeroes and the notation @xmath33 in the subscript in the above relations means _ either _ @xmath12 _ or _",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath35 matrices corresponding to the coloured extension of @xmath3 are @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 by definition . the coloured @xmath39 functionals can be expressed as @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the notation @xmath45 in the subscript means @xmath12 ( _ respectively _ @xmath13 ) .",
    "so , @xmath46 means @xmath47 ( _ resp . _",
    "@xmath48 ) each one of @xmath49 and @xmath50 depends on both @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the notation @xmath49 implies that the generators of the dual carry @xmath12 dependence , and similarly @xmath50 implies that the generators of the dual carry @xmath13 dependence .",
    "the duality pairings are then given by the action of the functionals @xmath49 and @xmath50 on the @xmath19-matrices @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 again , according to the notation introduced @xmath54 implies @xmath51 _ or _ @xmath52 and",
    "@xmath55 implies @xmath49 _ or _ @xmath50 .",
    "for vanishing colour variables , the coloured @xmath39 functionals reduce to the ordinary @xmath39 functionals for @xmath3 .",
    "the commutation relations of the algebra dual to a coloured quantum group can be obtained from the modified or the _ coloured _ @xmath1 relations @xmath56 using the coloured @xmath39 functionals where @xmath57 and @xmath58 . using the above formulae",
    ", we obtain the commutation relations between the generating elements of the algebra dual to the coloured extension of @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath59=b_{\\mu } \\qquad & \\left[d_{\\lambda},b_{\\mu}\\right]=-b_{\\mu } \\qquad & \\\\ \\left[a_{\\lambda},c_{\\mu}\\right]=-c_{\\mu } \\qquad & \\left[d_{\\lambda},c_{\\mu}\\right]=c_{\\mu } \\qquad & \\\\ \\left[a_{\\lambda},d_{\\mu}\\right]=0 \\qquad & \\left[h_{\\lambda},h_{\\mu}\\right]=0 \\qquad & \\left[h'_{\\lambda},\\bullet\\right]=0 \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath60\\ ] ] @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are as before .",
    "the relations satisfy the @xmath64 exchange symmetry .",
    "the associated coproduct of the elements of the dual algebra is given by @xmath65 the counit @xmath66 where @xmath67 and the antipode is @xmath68 thus we have defined a new single - parameter coloured quantum algebra corresponding to @xmath7 , which in the monochromatic limit defines the standard uncoloured two - parameter quantum algebra for @xmath7 .",
    "we now proceed towards a coloured generalisation of the constructive differential calculus @xcite for the coloured extension of @xmath0 .",
    "analogous to the standard uncoloured quantum group , a bimodule @xmath69 ( space of quantum one - forms @xmath70 ) is characterised by the commutation relations between @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the _ coloured _ quantum group corresponding to @xmath0 @xmath72 and the linear functional @xmath73 is defined in terms of the coloured @xmath39 matrices @xmath74 thus , we have @xmath75 \\omega\\ ] ] in terms of components , this can be written as @xmath76 \\omega_{kl}\\ ] ] using the expressions @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 . from these relations , one can obtain the commutation relations of all the left - invariant one - forms with the elements of the coloured extension of @xmath0 the left - invariant vector fields @xmath80 on @xmath81 are given by the expression @xmath82 the vector fields act on the elements @xmath83 of the coloured quantum group as @xmath84 furthermore , using the formula @xmath85 , we obtain the action of the exterior derivative on the generating elements @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath92 generates @xmath69 as a left @xmath81-module .",
    "this defines a first order differential calculus @xmath93 on the coloured extension of @xmath3 . since the colour variables @xmath12 and @xmath13 are continuously varying , the differential calculus obtained is infinite - dimensional . the differential calculus on the uncoloured single - parameter quantum group @xmath3 is easily recovered in the colourless limit and that of the uncoloured two - parameter quantum group @xmath29 in the monochromatic limit",
    "it is well - known that two bialgebras @xmath94 and @xmath81 are in duality if there exists a doubly nondegenerate bilinear form @xmath95 such that for @xmath96 and @xmath97 , we have @xmath98 @xmath99 for the two bialgebras to be in duality as hopf algebras , @xmath94 and @xmath81 further satisfy @xmath100 it is enough to define the pairing between the generating elements of the two algebras .",
    "pairing for any other elements of @xmath94 and @xmath81 follows from these relations and the bilinear form inherited by the tensor product .",
    "the geometric approach for duality for quantum groups was motivated by the fact that , at the classical level , an element of the lie algebra corresponding to a lie group is a tangent vector at the identity of the lie group .",
    "let @xmath101 be a given hopf algebra generated by non - commuting elements @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "the @xmath4-analogue of tangent vector at the identity would then be obtained by first differentiating the elements of the given hopf algebra @xmath101 ( polynomials in @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) and then putting @xmath106 later on ( i.e. , taking the counit operation analogous to the unit element at the group level ) .",
    "the elements thus obtained would belong to the dual hopf algebra @xmath107 .",
    "the approach is due to sudbery @xcite and dobrev @xcite and has proved to be quite a powerful tool in understanding the quantum group duality from a geometric point of view . in what follows in this section , we propose to give a coloured generalisation of such a geometric picture of duality using the example of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath108 denote the coloured extension of @xmath0 . then , as a hopf algebra @xmath108 is generated by elements @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the dual basis is given by all monomials of the form @xmath111 where @xmath112 , and @xmath113 is the unit of the algebra @xmath114 .",
    "we use a normal ordering as follows ; first put the diagonal elements from the @xmath115- matrix then use the lexicographic order for the others . let @xmath116 be the algebra generated by tangent vectors at the identity of @xmath108 . then @xmath116 is dually paired with @xmath108 .",
    "the pairing is defined through the coloured @xmath4-tangent vectors as follows @xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are the sets of generating elements of the dual algebra ( which has unit @xmath120 ) .",
    "more compactly , one can write @xmath121 explicitly , we obtain @xmath122 where differentiation is from the right . as a consequence of the above pairings ,",
    "the following relations hold @xmath123 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 as before .",
    "furthermore , @xmath124 the action of the monomials in @xmath116 on @xmath125 and @xmath126 then lead to the coloured @xmath4-commutation relations between the generators of the dual algebra .",
    "we have investigated the structure of the coloured extension of the quantum group @xmath3 and its dual algebra . after establishing the notion of duality , the dual algebra has been derived explicitly using the @xmath2-matrix approach .",
    "we not only obtain a new coloured quantum algebra corresponding to @xmath7 but also show that such a coloured generalisation of the @xmath2-matrix approach leads to formulating a constructive differential calculus for the coloured case .",
    "the colourless and the monochromatic limits of both the dual algebra as well as the differential calculus are in agreement with already known results for @xmath3 and @xmath29 . +",
    "in the later part of the paper , we have proposed a generalisation of the geometric picture of duality to incorporate the coloured extensions of quantum groups .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate in detail this setting in the context of the coloured jordanian quantum groups .",
    "the results easily extend to the higher - dimensional and multi - parametric cases .",
