    "there are compelling reasons for comparing the dynamical properties of satellite galaxies to isolated galaxies .",
    "such comparisons are likely to shed light on formation and evolution mechanisms for both dwarf irregular ( dirr ) and dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies . it is now known that these two classes of galaxies share the same stellar mass  stellar metallicity relation @xcite , which limits the amount of stellar stripping associated with possible transformations of dirrs to dsphs .",

    "* ) , analytic arguments @xcite and idealized numerical simulations @xcite indicate energy injection alone is unlikely to fully explain tbtf because the low stellar content of the milky way satellites places a strong limit on the amount of feedback available ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "environmental effects such as tides and ram pressure are therefore central to baryonic solutions to tbtf @xcite .",

    "another way to frame tbtf is that dark matter simulations predict more dense satellites than are observed .",
    "however , the field of the local group has no galaxy denser than the densest satellite of the mw or m31 .",

    "[ fig : sigmavlum ] shows velocity dispersions ( not circular velocities ) versus luminosities for both field and satellite dwarf galaxies .",

    "<S> we also computed velocity dispersions , taking into account the measurement uncertainties on individual stars . </S>",
    "<S> none of the isolated galaxies is denser than the densest local group satellite galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the isolated dwarf galaxies have no obvious distinction in the velocity dispersion  half - light radius plane from the satellite galaxies of the milky way and m31 . </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of the isolated and satellite galaxies dynamics and structural parameters imposes limitations on environmental solutions to the too - big - to - fail problem , wherein there are fewer dense dwarf satellite galaxies than would be expected from cold dark matter simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this data set also has many other applications for dwarf galaxy evolution , including the transformation of dwarf irregular into dwarf spheroidal galaxies . </S>",
