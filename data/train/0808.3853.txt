    "the latter hypothesis , however , was resting on indirect evidence , and still needs to be examined theoretically , which is one of the motivations of the present paper .    a _ continuum model _  @xcite of lfps incorporated the inhomogeneities of the extracellular medium into continuous spatial variations of conductivity ( @xmath1 ) and permittivity ( @xmath2 ) parameters .",

    "we start by outlining a macroscopic model with frequency - dependent electrical parameters ( section  [ sec - theor ] ) , and we discuss the main physical causes for this frequency dependence ( section  [ sec - freqdep ] ) .",
    "we then constrain the model to macroscopic measurements of electrical parameters , and provide numerical simulations to test the model and reproduce the experimental observations ( section  [ sec - sim ] ) .",
    "finally , we propose a possible way to test the model experimentally ( section  [ sec - test ] ) .      in this section ,",
    "we derive the equations governing the time evolution of the extracellular potential .",
    "we follow a formalism similar to the one developed previously  @xcite , except that we reformulate the model macroscopically , to allow the electrical parameters ( the conductivity @xmath1 and permittivity @xmath2 ) to depend on frequency , as demonstrated by macroscopic measurements  @xcite .",
    "the physical causes of this macroscopic frequency dependence will be examined in section  [ sec - freqdep ] .",
    "we begin by deriving a general equation for the electrical potential when the electrical parameters are frequency dependent .",

    "[ eqgeneral ] in the extracellular medium to obtain the frequency dependence of lfps .",
    "however , in practice , this equation can not be solved because the structure of the medium is too complex to properly define the limit conditions .",
    "the associated values of electric parameters must be specified for every point of space and for each frequency , which represents a considerable difficulty .",
    "one way to solve this problem is to consider a macroscopic or mean - field approach .",
    "this approach is justified here by the fact that the values measured experimentally are averaged values , which precision depends on the measurement technique . because our goal is to simulate those measured values , we will use a macroscopic model , in which we take spatial averages of eq .",
    "[ eqgeneral ] , and make a continuous approximation for the spatial variations of these average values .",
    "this type of approximation can be found in the classic theory of electromagnetism ( see for example chapters 9 and 10 in maxwell s treaty for electricity and magnetism  @xcite ) .    to this end",
    ", we define macroscopic electric parameters , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , as follows : @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the volume over which the spatial average is taken .",
    "we assume that @xmath39 is of the order of @xmath40 , and is thus much smaller than the cortical volume , so that the mean values will be dependent of the position in cortex .",
    "because the average values of electric parameters are statistically independent of the mean value of the electric field , we have : @xmath41 where the first term in the righthand represents the `` dissipative '' contribution , and the second term represents the `` reactive '' contribution ( reaction from the medium ) . here , all physical effects , such as diffusion , resistive and capacitive phenomena , are integrated into the frequency dependence of @xmath36 and @xmath35 .",
    "we will examine this frequency dependence more quantitatively in section  [ sec - freqdep ] .",

    "we can also assume @xmath45 such that @xmath46    because @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the expressions above ( eqs .",
    "[ ff ] ) can also be written in the form : @xmath49    we note that starting from the continuum model  @xcite , where only spatial variations were considered , and generalizing this model by including frequency - dependent electric parameters , gives the same mathematical form as the original model ( compare with eq  49 in ref .",
    "this form invariance will allow us to introduce in section  [ sec - freqdep ] the surface polarization phenomena by including an _ ad hoc _ frequency dependence in @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the physical causes of this macroscopic frequency dependence is that the cortical medium is microscopically non - neutral ( although the cortical tissue is macroscopically neutral ) .",
    "such a local non - neutrality was already postulated in a previous model of surface polarization  @xcite .",
    "this situation can not be accounted by eq .",
    "[ eqgeneral ] if @xmath50 and @xmath51 are frequency independent ( in which case @xmath52 when @xmath53 ) .",

    "finally , a fundamental point is that the frequency dependences of the electrical parameters @xmath50 and @xmath51 can not take arbitrary values , but are related to each - other by the kramers - kronig relations  @xcite : @xmath54 and @xmath55 where principal value integrals are used .",

    "note that , contrary to frequency dependence , the spatial dependences of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are independent of each other , because these dependences are related to the spatial distribution of elements within the extracellular medium .      to obtain an expression for the extracellular potential ,",
    "we need to solve eq .",
    "[ eqgeneralm ] , which is possible analytically only if we consider a simplified geometry of the source and surrounding medium .",
    "the first simplification is to consider the source as monopolar",
    ". the choice of a monopolar source does not intrinsically reduce the validity of the results because multipolar configurations can be composed from the arrangement of a finite number of monopoles  @xcite .",
    "in particular , if the physical nature of the extracellular medium determines a frequency dependence for a monopolar source , it will also do so for multipolar configurations .",
    "a second simplification will be to consider that the current source is spherical and that the potential is uniform on its surface .",
    "this simplification will enable us to calculate exact expressions for the extracellular potential and should not affect the results on frequency dependence .",
    "a third simplification is to consider the extracellular medium as isotropic .",
    "this assumption is certainly valid within a macroscopic approach , and justified by the fact that the neuropil of cerebral cortex is made of a quasi - random arrangement of cellular processes of very diverse size  @xcite .",
    "this simplified geometry will allow us to determine how the physical nature of the extracellular medium can determine a frequency dependence of the lfps , independently of other factors ( such as more realistic geometry , propagating potentials along dendrites , etc ) .",

    "we successively consider two different cases of extracellular medium : first , `` non - reactive '' media , in which the current passively flows into the medium ; second , `` reactive '' media , in which some properties ( such as charge distribution ) may change following current flow . for each medium , we will consider two types of physical phenomena , the current produced by the electric field , and the current produced by ionic diffusion , as schematized in fig .",

    "note that , if the electric field primes over ionic diffusion , then we have the situation described by model  n above .      in reality ,",

    "such charge densities will necessarily be influenced by the electric field or by ionic diffusion .",
    "as above , we first consider the case with only electric field effects and will consider next the influence of diffusion and the two phenomena taken together .",
    "electric polarization is a prominent type of `` reaction '' of the extracellular medium to the electric field . in particular",

    "it was shown previously in a theoretical study that this `` surface polarization '' phenomena can have important effects on the propagation of local field potentials  @xcite .",

    "consequently , the domain defined by extracellular fluid is said to be _",
    "linearly connex_. in this case , the electric potential arising from a current source is necessarily continuous in the extracellular fluid .",
    "second , in a first approximation , we can consider that the cellular processes surrounding sources are arranged randomly ( by opposition to being regularly structured ) and their distribution is therefore approximately isotropic .",

    "asymptotically , the system will reach an equilibrium where the polarization will neutralize the electric field , such that there is no electric field inside the cells ( zero current ) .",
    "now suppose that , in the asymptotic regime , there would still be a current flowing in between cells ( in the extracellular fluid ) , then we have two possibilities .",

    "measurements in aqueous solutions of nacl and in gray matter  @xcite , gives values of @xmath96 comprised between 1  ms and 100  ms for frequencies around 10  hz .",
    "thus , the model predicts that in the gabriel et al .",
    "experiments , the transformation of electric current carried by electrons to ionic current in the biological medium necessarily implies an accumulation of ions at the plates of the capacitor .",
    "this ion accumulation will in general depend on frequency , because the conductivity and permittivity of the biological medium are frequency dependent .",
    "this will create a concentration gradient across the biological medium , which will cause a ionic diffusion current opposite to the electric current .",

    "it is important to note that this parameter choice is entirely dependent on the ratio between ionic diffusion current and the current produced by the electric field , and thus will be depend on the particular experimental conditions .",

    "the main difference between these models is that the cole - cole model is phenomenological and has never been deduced from physical principles for low frequencies , unlike the present model which is entirely deduced from well - defined physical phenomena .",

    "4 electrodes were aligned and spaced by 3  mm in monkey cortex .",
    "the first and last electrodes were used to inject current , while the two intermediate electrodes were used to measure the extracellular voltage .",
    "the voltage was measured at different frequencies and current intensities .",
    "one important point in this experimental setup is that the intensity of the current was such that the voltage at the extreme ( injecting ) electrodes saturates .",
    "one of the consequences of this saturation was to limit ionic diffusion effects , as discussed by the authors  @xcite .",
    "this voltage saturation will diminish the concentration difference near the source ( we would have an amplification if this was not the case ) .",
    "it follows that , in the logothetis et al .",
    "experiments , the ratio between diffusion current and electric field current is very small .",
    "thus , in this case we use values of parameters @xmath144 very different from those assumed above to reproduce gabriel et al .  experiments , in particular @xmath145 . as we will see in the discussion section",
    ", this situation may be different from the physiological conditions .",
    "nevertheless , the large distance between electrodes suggests that the relation between current and voltage is linear because the current density is roughly proportional to the inverse of squared distance to the source .",
    "consequently , we can suppose that in the logothetis et al .",

    "thus , in this experiment , most  if not all  of the extracellular current is due to electric - field effects .    in this situation , the conductivity ( eq .  [ apparent ] ) becomes : @xmath146 which is similar to the `` model p '' above .",
    "moreover , taking the same maxwell - wagner time @xmath91 as above for gabriel et al .",
    "experiments ( which corresponds to a cutoff frequency of 1  hz ) , we have for frequencies above 10  hz : @xmath147 similar to a resistive medium .    thus , in the logothetis et al",
    ".  experiments , the saturation phenomenon entrains current propagation in the biological medium as if the medium was quasi - resistive for frequencies larger than 10  hz .",
    "this constitutes a possible explanation of the contrasting results in logothetis et al .  and gabriel et al",
    ".  measurements .      the third type of experimental observation is the fact that the power spectral density ( psd ) of lfps or eeg signals displays 1/f frequency scaling  @xcite . to examine",
    "if this 1/f scaling can be accounted for by the present formalism , we consider a spherical current source embedded in a continuous macroscopic medium .",
    "we also assume that the psd of the current source is a lorentzian , which could derive for example from randomly occurring exponentially decaying postsynaptic currents  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ dsp ] ) .    to simulate this situation we used the `` diffusion - polarization '' model with ionic diffusion and electric field effects in a reactive medium .",
    "we have estimated above that surface polarization phenomena have a cutoff frequency of the order of 1  hz , and will not play a role above that frequency .",
    "so , if we focus on the psd of extracellular potentials in the frequency range larger than 1  hz , we can consider only the effect of ionic diffusion ( in agreement with the gabriel et al .",
    "experiments  see above ) .",
    "thus , we can approximate the conductivity as ( see eq .  [ apparent ] ) : @xmath148 where @xmath85 is a constant .",
    "it follows that the extracellular voltage around a spherical current source is given by ( see eq .  [ impedance ] ) : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the radius of the source .",
    "+     figure  [ dsp ] here     in other words , we can say that the extracellular potential is given by the current source @xmath151 convolved with a filter in 1/@xmath152 , which is essentially due to ionic diffusion ( warburg impedance ; see refs .",
    "a white noise current source will thus result in a psd scaling as 1/f , and can explain the experimental observations , as shown in fig .",
    "experimentally recorded lfps in cat parietal cortex display lfps with frequency scaling as 1/f for low frequencies , and 1/f@xmath153 for high frequencies",
    "[ dsp]a - b ) .",
    "following the same procedure as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we reconstructed the synaptic current source from experimentally recorded spike trains ( fig .",
    "[ dsp]c - d ) .",
    "the psd of the current source scales as a lorentzian ( fig .",
    "[ dsp]e ) as expected from the exponential nature of synaptic currents . calculating the lfp around the source and taking into account ionic diffusion ,",
    "gives a psd with two frequency bands , scaling in 1/f for low frequencies , and 1/f@xmath153 for high frequencies",

    "this is the frequency scaling observed experimentally for lfps in awake cat cortex  @xcite .",
    "we conclude that ionic diffusion is a plausible physical cause of the @xmath0 structure of lfps for low frequencies .",
    "two important points must be noted .",
    "first , the diffusion - plolarization model does not automatically predict @xmath0 scaling at low frequencies , but rather implements an @xmath0 filter , which may result in frequency scaling with larger slopes .",
    "second , the same experimental situation may result in different frequency scaling , and this is also consistent with the diffusion - polarization model .",
    "these two points are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ dsp2 ] which shows a similar analysis as fig .",
    "[ dsp ] but during slow - wave sleep in the same experiment .",
    "the lfp is dominated by slow - wave activity ( fig .",
    "[ dsp2]a ) , and the different units display firing patterns characterized by concerted `` pauses '' ( gray lines in fig .",
    "[ dsp2]b ) , characteristic of slow - wave sleep and which are also visible in the reconstructed synaptic current ( fig .",
    "[ dsp2]c ) .",
    "the psd shows a similar scaling as @xmath154 as for wakefulness , but the scaling at low frequencies is different ( slope around -2 at low frequencies ; see fig .",
    "[ dsp2]d ) .",
    "the psd reconstructed using the diffusion - polarization model displays similar features ( compare with fig .",
    "[ dsp2]e ) .",
    "this analysis shows that the diffusion - polarization model qualitatively accounts for different regions of frequency scaling found experimentally in different frequency bands and network states .",
    "+     figure  [ dsp2 ] here       in this final section , we examine a possible way to test the model experimentally .",
    "the main prediction of the model is that , in natural conditions , the extracellular current perpendicular to the source is dominated by ionic diffusion .",
    "the experiments realized so far  @xcite used macroscopic currents that did not necessarily respect the correct current flow in the tissue .",
    "we suggest to create more naturalistic current sources by creating ionic currents using a micropipette placed in the extracellular medium . by using periodic current injection during very short time",
    "@xmath155 compared to the period ( small duty cycle ) , we can measure using the same electrode the extracellular voltage @xmath156 ( using a fixed reference far away from the source ) .",
    "if the period of the source is shorter than the relaxation time of the system , the voltage will integrate , which is due to charge accumulation .    because @xmath156 is directly proportional to the amount of charge emitted as a function of time during @xmath155 ( capacitive effect of the extracellular medium ) , the time variation of @xmath156 is directly proportional to the ionic diffusion current .",
    "in such conditions , if the extracellular medium is purely resistive , as predicted by logothetis et al .",
    "experiments , the relaxation time should be very small , of the order of @xmath157 @xcite , which would prevent any integration phenomena and charge accumulation for frequencies below @xmath158  hz .",
    "if the medium has a slower relaxation , due to polarization and ionic diffusion , then we should observe voltage integration and charge accumulation for physiological frequencies ( @xmath126  1000  hz ) .    to illustrate the difference between these two situations , we consider the simplest case of a non - reactive medium ( as in model  d above ) , in which the current can be produced by ionic diffusion or by the electric field , or by both . to calculate the time variations of ionic concentration and extracellular voltage",
    ", we consider the current density : @xmath159 + \\sigma \\vec{e}\\ ] ] according to the differential law for charge conservation and poisson law , we have : @xmath160 when ionic diffusion is negligible compared to ohm s law , we have : @xmath161 it follows that the charge density is given by : @xmath162    on the other hand , if ionic diffusion is the primary cause of current propagation in the extracellular medium , then the relaxation time should be much larger and thus , integration should be observed .",
    "when ionic diffusion is dominant , we have : @xmath163 instead of eq .  [ pe ] .",
    "the general solution is : @xmath164    the difference between the expressions above ( eqs .",
    "[ sol1 ] and [ sol2 ] ) shows that the time variation of charge density is different according to which current dominates , electric field current or ionic diffusion current .",
    "the same applies to the electric potential between the electrode and a given reference , because this potential is linked to charge density through poisson s law .",
    "therefore , this experiment would be crucial to clearly show which of the two current primes for currents perpendicular to the source ( this would not apply to longitudinal currents , like axial currents in dendrites ) . in the hypothetical case of dominant ionic diffusion ,",
    "the cortex would be similar to a warburg impedance and one can estimate the macroscopic diffusion coefficient using eq .",
    "[ sol2 ] .",
    "thus , using a micropipette injecting periodic current pulses , it should be possible to test the capacity of the medium to create charge accumulation for physiological frequencies .",
    "if this is the case , this would constitute evidence that ionic currents are non - negligible in the physiological situation .",
    "in the present paper , we have proposed a framework to model local field potentials , and which synthesizes previous measurements and models .",
    "this framework integrates microscopic measurements of electric parameters ( conductivity @xmath1 and permittivity @xmath2 ) of extracellular fluids , with macroscopic measurements of those parameters ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) in cortical tissue  @xcite .",
    "it also integrates previous models of lfps , such as the _ continuum model _",
    "@xcite , which was based on a continuum hypothesis of electric parameters variations in extracellular space , or the _ polarization model _",
    "@xcite , which explicitly considered different media ( fluid and membranes ) and their polarization by the current sources .",
    "the present model is more general and also integrates ionic diffusion , which is predicted as a major determinant of the frequency dependence of lfps .",
    "this `` diffusion - polarization '' model also accounts for observations of @xmath0 frequency scaling of lfp power spectra , which is due here to ionic diffusion , and is therefore predicted to be a consequences of the genesis of the lfp signal , rather than being solely due to neuronal activity ( see ref .",
    "finally , this work suggests that ephatic interactions between neurons can occur not only through electric fields but that ionic diffusion should also be considered in such interactions .",
    "as discussed in section  [ simplif ] , the present model rests on several approximations , which were necessary to obtain the analytic expressions used here .",
    "these approximations were that current sources were considered as monopolar entities ( longitudinal currents such as axial currents in dendrites were not taken into account ) , the current source was spherical and the extracellular medium was considered isotropic .",
    "because multipolar effects can be reconstructed from the superposition of monopoles  @xcite , the monopolar configuration should not affect the results on frequency dependence , as long as the extracellular current perpendicular to the source is considered .",
    "similarly , the exact geometry of the current source should have no influence on the frequency dependence far away from the sources .",
    "however , in the immediate vicinity of the sources , the geometric nature and the synchrony of synaptic currents can have influences on the power spectrum  @xcite .",
    "another assumption is that the extracellular medium is isotropic , which was justified within the macroscopic framework followed here .",
    "these factors , however , will influence the exact shape of the lfps .",
    "more quantitative models including a more sophisticated geometry of current sources and the presence of membrane excitability and action potentials should be considered ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the main prediction of the present model is that ionic diffusion is an essential physical cause for the frequency dependence of lfps .",
    "we have shown that the presence of ionic diffusion allows the model to account quantitatively for the macroscopic measurements of the frequency dependence of electric parameters in cortical tissue  @xcite .",
    "ionic diffusion is responsible for a frequency dependence of the impedance as @xmath165 for low frequencies ( @xmath126  1000  hz ) , which directly accounts for the observed @xmath0 frequency scaling of lfp and eeg power spectra during wakefulness  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ dsp ] ) .",
    "note that the eeg is more complex because it depends on the diffusion of electric signals across fluids , dura matter , skull , muscles and skin .",
    "however , this `` filtering '' is of low - pass type , and may not affect the low - frequency band , so there is a possibility that the 1/f scaling of eeg and lfps have a common origin . the present model is consistent with the view that this apparent `` @xmath0 noise '' in brain signals is not generated by self - organized features of brain activity , but is rather a consequence of the genesis of the signal and its propagation through extracellular space  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the fact that ionic diffusion may be responsible for @xmath0 frequency scaling of lfps is not inconsistent with other factors which may also influence frequency scaling .",
    "for example , the statistics of network activity  and more generally network state  can affect frequency scaling .",
    "this is apparent when comparing awake and slow - wave sleep lfp recordings in the same experiment , showing that the @xmath0 scaling is only seen in wakefulness but @xmath166 scaling is rather seen during sleep  @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ dsp2 ] ) . in agreement with this , recent results indicate that the correlation structure of synaptic activity may influence frequency scaling at the level of the membrane potential , and that correlated network states scale with larger ( more negative ) exponents  @xcite .",
    "we also investigated ways to explain the measurements of logothetis et al .",
    "@xcite , who reported that the extracellular medium was resistive and therefore did not display frequency dependence , in contradiction with gabriel et al .",
    "@xcite measurements .",
    "we summarize and discuss our conclusions below .    in gabriel",
    "experiments  @xcite , one measures permittivity and conductivity in the medium in between two metal plates .",
    "this forms a capacitor , which ( macroscopic ) complex impedance is measured .",
    "this measure actually consists of two independent measurements , the real and imaginary part of the impedance .",
    "these values are used to deduce the macroscopic permittivity and macroscopic conductivity of the medium . however , at the interface between the medium and the metal plates , the flow of electrons in the metal corresponds to a flow of charges in the tissue , and a variety of phenomena can occur , which can interfere the measurement .",
    "the accumulation of charges that occurs at the interface between the electrode and the extracellular fluid implies a polarization impedance , which depends on the interaction between ions and the metal plate .",
    "because this accumulation of charge implies a variation of concentration , the flow of ions may involve an important component of ionic diffusion .    in logothetis et al .",
    "experiments , a system of 4 electrodes is used , the two extreme electrodes inject current in the medium , while the two electrodes in the middle are exclusively used to measure the voltage .",
    "this system is supposed to be more accurate than gabriel s , because the electrodes that measure voltage are not subject to charge accumulation . however , the drawback of this method are nonlinear effects .",
    "the magnitude of the injected current is such that the voltage at the extreme electrodes saturates .",
    "this voltage saturation also implies saturation of concentration ( capacitive effect between electrodes ) , which limits ionic diffusion currents .",
    "thus , the ratio between ionic diffusion currents and the currents due to the electric field is greatly diminished relative to gabriel et al .  experiments .",
    "we think that natural current sources are closer to gabriel et al .",
    "situation for several reasons .",
    "first , the magnitude of the currents produced by biological sources is far too low for saturation effects .",
    "second , the flow of charges across ion channels will produce perturbations of ionic concentration , which will be re - equilibrated by diffusion .",
    "the effects may not be as strong as the perturbations of concentrations induced by gabriel et al .",
    "type of experiments , but ionic diffusion should play a role in both cases .",
    "this is precisely one of the aspects that should be evaluated in further experiments .",
    "the logothetis et al .",
    "experiments were done using a 4-electrode setup which neutralizes the influence of electrode impedance on voltage measurements  @xcite .",
    "this system was used to perform high - precision impedance measurements , also avoiding ionic diffusion effects  @xcite . indeed , these experimental conditions , and the apparent resistive medium , could be reproduced by the present model if ionic diffusion was neglected .",
    "the present model therefore formulates the strong prediction that ionic diffusion is important , and that any measurement technique should allow ionic diffusion to reveal the correct frequency - dependent properties of impedance and electric parameters in biological tissue .",
    "the critical question that remains to be solved is whether , in physiological conditions , ionic diffusion plays a role as important as suggested here .",
    "we propose a simple method to test this hypothesis .",
    "the frequency dependence could be evaluated by using an extracellular electrode injecting current in conditions as close as possible to physiological conditions ( a micropipette would be appropriate ) . by measuring the integration of the extracellular voltage following periodic current injection",
    ", one could estimate the `` relaxation time '' of the medium with respect to charge accumulation .",
    "if this relaxation time occurs at time scales relevant to neuronal currents ( milliseconds ) rather than the fast relaxation predicted by a purely resistive medium ( picoseconds ) , then ionic diffusion will necessarily occur in physiological conditions , which would provide evidence in favor of the present mechanism .",
    "in this appendix , we evaluate the ratio between ionic diffusion currents and electric field currents in the extracellular space directly adjacent to the source .",
    "this ratio measures if the ionic diffusion current perpendicular to the membrane is greater than the electric field current .",
    "we will design this ratio by the term @xmath167 .",
    "we have in general @xmath168 + \\sigma \\nabla v ~ , \\ ] ] where the first term in right hand is the electric current density produced by ionic diffusion , while the second term is that produced by differential ohm s law .    for a displacement @xmath169 in the direction across the membrane ( from inside to outside )",
    ", we have approximatively : @xmath170_{\\delta r = 10 nm}+\\sigma_{\\omega } \\delta v_{\\delta r = 10 nm}\\ ] ]    suppose that we have a spherical cell of @xmath171 radius , embedded in sea water and at resting potential .",
    "the resting membrane potential is a dynamic equilibrium between inflow and outflow of charges , in which these two fluxes are equal on ( temporal ) average .",
    "fluctuations of current around this average in the extracellular medium around the membrane have all characteristics of thermal noise  @xcite because the shot noise ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) is zero when the current is zero on average , such that the net charge on the external side of the membrane varies around a mean value with the same characteristics as white noise ( thermal noise ) .",
    "these fluctuations will therefore be present also at the level of the membrane potential . in this appendix",
    ", we evaluate the order of magnitude of the electric current caused by ionic diffusion , relative to the electric field for this situation of dynamic equilibrium .",
    "first , the ratio between the membrane voltage noise and the variation of total charge concentration is given by @xmath172 because the cell s capacitance is given by @xmath173 ( @xmath174 )    second , mass conservation imposes : @xmath175_{tot } ~ , \\ ] ] where @xmath176 and @xmath177 is the volume of the spherical shell containing the charges . because the charges are not uniformly distributed inside the cell , but rather distributed within a thin spherical shell adjacent to the membrane , because the electric field developed across the membrane is very intense ( of the order of @xmath178 ) ,",
    "thus , the width of the shell is of the order of @xmath179 , where the volume of the spherical shell is approximately equal to @xmath180 . in this case",
    ", we have for monovalent ions ( @xmath181 ) @xmath182_{tot } \\simeq 2.2\\times10^{-38}\\delta[c]_{tot}=2.2\\times10^{-38}\\delta[c]_{\\delta r = 10 nm}\\ ] ] if we assume that the variation of concentration on the adjacent border of the exterior surface of the cell is over a width of @xmath183 .    in this case",
    ", we have @xmath184_{\\delta r = 10 nm}}{\\delta   v_{membrane } } = \\frac{k_1}{k_2 } \\simeq 10^{27}~ c / m^3v\\ ] ]    third , the potential difference between the cell surface and @xmath183 away of it , is given by @xmath185    consequently , the ratio between ionic diffusion current and electric diffusion current caused by thermal noise in sea water obeys @xmath186_{\\delta r = 10 nm}\\delta t}{\\sigma_{\\omega}^{sea}\\delta v_{\\delta r = 10 nm } } = \\frac{e d_{sea}k_1}{\\sigma_{\\omega}^{sea } k_2}\\simeq \\frac{10^{2}}{\\sigma_{\\omega}^{sea } } ~ , \\ ] ] where the diffusion constant of @xmath187 or @xmath188 in sea water is of the order of @xmath189 .",
    "this implies that the ratio @xmath73 is much larger than 1 for frequencies @xmath1261000  hz because @xmath190 of sea water is necessarily @xmath191 .",
    "because tortuosity is given by @xmath192 , and is comprised between 1.6 and 2.2 ( for small and large molecules , respectively ) in cerebral cortex  @xcite , the macroscopic diffusion constant in cortex is certainly larger than @xmath193 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath194 where @xmath195 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this evaluation shows that the phenomenon of ionic diffusion is essential to determine the current field in the cortex .",
    "finally , we note that we did not need to evaluate the absolute magnitude of @xmath196 in our evaluation .",
    "this evaluation is valid for a physical situation where we have a permanent white noise over a distance of 10  nm , independently of the intensity of this noise ( which in practice will depend on many factors , such as the size of the cell , the number of ion channels , etc ) .",
    "in this appendix , we calculate the frequency dependence of ionic diffusion current outside of a spherical current source .",
    "we consider a constant variation of ionic concentration , @xmath197 , on the surface of the source , and a null variation at an infinite distance ( warburg conditions ) .",
    "the diffusion equation for a given ionic species is @xmath198 where @xmath197 is the perturbation of concentration @xmath199 of ion @xmath200 around the steady - state value , and @xmath201 is the associated diffusion coefficient .",
    "this diffusion coefficient depends of the ionic species considered and the structure of the medium .",
    "because the geometry of the problem and the limit conditions respect spherical symmetry , we use spherical coordinates . in this coordinate system",
    ", we have @xmath202\\ ] ] because @xmath197 does not depend on @xmath203 and of @xmath204 ( spheric symmetry ) .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath197 with respect to time gives : @xmath205 which general solution is given by : @xmath206    for a variation of concentration at the source border which is independent of frequency and which satisfies the warburg hypothesis ( the variation of concentration tends to zero at an infinite distance  @xcite ) , we have : @xmath207 where @xmath73 is the distance between the center of the source and @xmath150 is the radius of the source .    thus , the electric current density produced by ionic diffusion is given by : @xmath208 where @xmath209 is the charge of ions @xmath200 .    because we can consider that the source and extracellular medium form a spherical capacitor , the voltage difference between the surface of the source and infinite distance is given by @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the capacitance value .",
    "thus , the electric impedance of the medium is given by : @xmath212    for a source of radius @xmath213 and a macroscopic ionic diffusion coefficient of the order of @xmath214 , and for frequencies @xmath215 1  hz , we can approximate the impedance by : @xmath216    the same expression for the impedance is also obtained in cylindric coordinates or planar cartesian coordinates ( not shown ) .",
    "note that if several ionic species are present , then the superposition principle applies ( fick equations are linear ) and therefore the contribution of each ion will add - up .",
    "the diffusion constants for different ions are of the same order of magnitude ( for na@xmath217 , k@xmath217 , cl@xmath218 , ca@xmath219 ) , so no particular ion would be expected to dominate .",

    "<S> the power spectrum of local field potentials ( lfps ) has been reported to scale as the inverse of the frequency , but the origin of this `` @xmath0 noise '' is at present unclear . </S>",
    "<S> macroscopic measurements in cortical tissue demonstrated that electric conductivity ( as well as permittivity ) is frequency dependent , while other measurements failed to evidence any dependence on frequency . in the present paper , we propose a model of the genesis of lfps which accounts for the above data and contradictions . </S>",
    "<S> starting from first principles ( maxwell equations ) , we introduce a macroscopic formalism in which macroscopic measurements are naturally incorporated , and also examine different physical causes for the frequency dependence . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that ionic diffusion primes over electric field effects , and is responsible for the frequency dependence . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the contradictory observations , and also reproduces the @xmath0 power spectral structure of lfps , as well as more complex frequency scaling </S>",
    "<S> . finally , we suggest a measurement method to reveal the frequency dependence of current propagation in biological tissue , and which could be used to directly test the predictions of the present formalism . </S>"
