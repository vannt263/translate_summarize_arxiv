    "understanding the physical properties of devices of micron- and nano - meters sizes is of interest these days since the trend is in miniaturizing them .",
    "such devices may need to be kept under certain environmental condition such as a particular temperature in order for them to optimally operate .",
    "we envision heat pumps ( or refrigerators ) of similar sizes that provide such favorable condition .",
    "on the other hand , heat engines of similar sizes may provide energy to these devices in order for them to perform different tasks .",
    "this paper deals with a model of such tiny heat engine or , conversely , heat pump and explores the details .",
    "the idea of microscopic ( or brownian ) heat engine working due to non - uniform temperature first came up with the works of bttiker @xcite , van kampen @xcite , and landuaer @xcite while they were involved in exposing the significance of the now influential papers of landauer on blowtorch effect @xcite .",
    "later works took models of brownian heat engine and dealt with the energetics only at the quasi - static limit @xcite .",
    "energetics considerations for such engine operating in a finite time were first addressed by dernyi et al . @xcite and recently by us @xcite .",
    "these two works of us also revealed that the quasi - static limits of either the heat engine or the heat pump behave exactly like that of a carnot s heat engine or heat pump .    in our first paper @xcite",
    ", we considered a brownian particle moving through a highly viscous medium in a periodic sawtooth potential ( with or without load ) assisted by the thermal kick it gets from _ alternately _ placed hot and cold heat reservoirs along its path .",
    "the heat reservoirs were placed in such a way that the whole left side of each sawtooth from its barrier top is coupled to the hot reservoir while the whole right side is coupled to the cold reservoir .    in the present work , instead of coupling the whole left side of each sawtooth to the hot reservoir we let it be hot within a narrower but varying width located at a position that can also vary as a parameter .",
    "this will introduce two additional parameters to the model and , thereby , address a more general problem . by evaluating the way energy exchange takes place between the particle and the medium ,",
    "we explore the conditions under which the model works either as a heat engine or as a heat pump .",
    "one new result is the existence of a third region in the parameter space where the model works neither as a heat engine nor as a heat pump with rich phase diagrams .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we will consider our model in the absence of external load . in this case",
    "we will show that the model works only as a heat engine and , at quasistatic limit , the efficiency goes to that of carnot efficiency . in section iii",
    "we will consider our model in the presence of external load and explore how current , efficiency and coefficient of performance of the model vary with change in model parameters of interest .",
    "we will identify the different operating regions ( as a heat engine , as a refrigerator or neither of the two ) of the model in phase diagrams .",
    "section iv deals with summary and conclusion .",
    "the model consists of a brownian particle which moves in a viscous medium in a periodic sawtooth potential where the background temperature is also periodic but piecewise constant as shown in fig . 1 . here",
    "u(x ) denotes the potential of the sawtooth with a barrier height of @xmath1 .",
    "one of the maxima of the potential is located at x=0 and the two minima on the left and right sides of this maximum potential are located at @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "two dimensionless parameters , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , specify the position and width of each hot locality such that @xmath4 describes the position of the left side of the hot locality from the nearest barrier top while @xmath6 describes the width of the hot locality , both in units of @xmath7 . here one should note that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are limited to take values between zero and one : @xmath10 and @xmath11 . on the other hand , in our previous work @xcite both @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "are taken to have a fixed value of one .",
    "the quantities @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the figure denote the temperature values of the hot and cold localities , respectively .",
    "a third parameter , @xmath14 , relates the temperature of the hot locality with the cold locality such that @xmath15 .",
    "the potential , @xmath16 , for our model is a series of identical sawtooth potentials .",
    "one sawtooth potential around x=0 is described by @xmath17,&if $ -l_{1 } < x \\le 0$;\\cr     u_{0}[{-x\\over l_{2}}+1],&if $ 0 < x \\le l_{2}$;\\cr     } \\ ] ] and this potential profile repeats itself such that @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "note that @xmath16 is determined by three parameters : @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature profile is given by @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the heavyside function .",
    "this temperature profile repeats itself with the same period as that of the potential : @xmath24 .",
    "the presence of hot and cold regions coupled to the different parts of the sawtooth potential determines the brownian particle to be driven unidirectionally and attain a steady state current , @xmath25 .",
    "a general expression for the steady state current of the brownian particle in any periodic potential ( with or without load ) is derived in appendix a. using the particular potential and temperature profiles of eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , we have evaluated the expressions for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 in appendix a , eqs .",
    "( a10 , a11,a12 , and a13 ) , and found an exact closed form expression for the steady state current @xmath25    @xmath30    the expressions for @xmath26 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath29 are given in appendix b. the drift velocity , @xmath33 , is then given by @xmath34    as an approximation , we neglect the energy transfer via kinetic energy due to the particle recrossing of the boundary between the regions @xcite and find the energetics of the particle as it exchanges energy with the heat reservoirs . in one cycle the brownian",
    "particle is in contact with the hot region of width @xmath35 while the particle is in contact with the cold region of width @xmath36 .",
    "when the particle moves through the hot region , it takes an energy @xmath37 which enables it not only to climb up the potential of magnitude @xmath38 but also acquire energy @xmath39 to overcome the viscous drag force within the hot interval .",
    "hence during one cycle , the amount of heat flow out of the hot reservoir , @xmath37 , is given by @xmath40 the net heat flow per cycle from the brownian particle to the cold reservoir , @xmath41 , is by a similar argument given by @xmath42 the difference between @xmath37 and @xmath41 is the useful work : @xmath43 this is exactly the amount of work required to transport the brownian particle moving with a drift velocity @xmath33 through one cycle in the viscous medium .",
    "it is important to emphasize at this point that in the absence of external load the model works only as heat engine . following the definition of generalized efficiency introduced in @xcite , the efficiency of the engine , @xmath44 ,",
    "is given by @xmath45 one can notice that the magnitude of the current approaches to zero when @xmath1 goes to zero .",
    "this corresponds to the quasistatic limit of the engine ; i.e. @xmath46 . evaluating the efficiency at quasistatic limit",
    ", we found that    @xmath47    which is exactly equal to the efficiency of a carnot engine .    in order for us to explore how current and efficiency vary with change in one of the newly introduced parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ", we first introduce three scaled parameters : scaled length @xmath48 , scaled barrier height @xmath49 and scaled current @xmath50 where @xmath51 ; @xmath52 being boltzmann s constant .    for fixed values of @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ,",
    "the current @xmath56 is plotted as a function of @xmath9 as shown in fig .",
    "2 . when @xmath57 , the whole sawtooth potential is coupled with cold reservoir .",
    "hence there is no net current as can be seen in the figure . increasing the width of the hot locality leads to an increase in the current .",
    "we also plot the engine efficiency , @xmath44 , as a function of @xmath9 as shown in fig .",
    "the figure shows that @xmath44 increases with increase in @xmath9 .",
    "one can fix the width of the hot locality , @xmath9 , and investigate the influence of shifting the position of the hot locality along one side of the sawtooth potential .",
    "figure 4 is a plot of @xmath56 versus @xmath8 for a given values of @xmath58 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the figure shows that the current @xmath56 increases as @xmath8 increases which implies that positioning the hot locality near the potential minimum produces the highest possible value of current than putting it anywhere else .",
    "likewise , plot of @xmath44 versus @xmath8 in fig .",
    "5 shows similar feature as in fig . 4 in the sense that one gets highest possible efficiency if the hot locality is put near the potential minimum than anywhere else .",
    "in the next section we will consider our model to also have external load .",
    "consider the model in the presence of a constant external load @xmath59 as shown in fig .",
    "the potential profile will then change from @xmath16 described by eq .",
    "( 1 ) to @xmath60 .",
    "similar to the previous section , the closed form expression for steady state current @xmath61 in the presence of external load is derived and given by @xmath62 the expressions for @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given in appendix c. the drift velocity , @xmath67 , is then given by @xmath68    before we begin exploring various properties of the model , we introduce a scaled quantity associated with the load : @xmath69 .",
    "we will then have a total of six parameters that can be controlled independently : @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath14 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath72 . fig .",
    "7 is a plot of ( scaled ) current @xmath56 versus @xmath9 for fixed values of all the other parameters .",
    "the figure shows that the current monotonously increases with @xmath9 being negative for small values of @xmath9 ( hot locality width ) and then becoming positive beyond a certain value of @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that in the interval where the current is negative external work is being done _ on _ the engine while in the interval where the current is positive the engine _ does _ work not only against the viscous medium but also against the load . in order to find whether the engine works either as a heat engine , or as a refrigerator or other wise",
    ", we need to find energy exchange between the particle and the heat reservoirs .",
    "when the model behaves as a heat engine , the current takes postive value ( see fig . 7 ) and in one cycle the particle takes heat energy @xmath73 from the hot reservoir of amount @xmath74 and gives off an amount of heat @xmath75\\ ] ] to the cold reservoir . the net work , @xmath76 , done by the heat engine in one cycle",
    "is given by the difference between @xmath73 and @xmath77 : @xmath78 the generalized efficiency of the heat engine will then be given by @xmath79 on the other hand , when the model works as a refrigerator heat flows out of the cold reservoir and enters the hot reservoir driven by the external work of amount @xmath80 done on the refrigerator per cycle . in the region where the model works as a refrigrator",
    ", the coefficient of performance ( cop ) of the refrigerator , @xmath81 , is given by @xmath82\\over f(l_{1}+l_{2})}.\\ ] ]    the quasi - static limit of the engine corresponds to the case where the current approaches to zero either from the heat engine side or from the refrigerator side .",
    "we have found that this limit is satisfied when @xmath83 this is the boundary demarcating the domain of the operation of the engine as a refrigerator from that as a heat engine .",
    "evaluating the expression for both @xmath44 and @xmath81 as we approach this boundary , we analytically found that they are exactly equal to that of carnot efficiency and carnot cop , respectively : @xmath84 and @xmath85    we now explore how the @xmath44 and @xmath81 behave as a function of @xmath9 fixing all other parameters . within the region where the model works as a heat engine ,",
    "we find the efficiency to monotonously decrease from its maximum value ( carnot efficiency ) as the width , @xmath9 , of the hot locality increases ( see fig . 8) . on the other hand , within the region where the model works as a refrigerator the cop linearly increases with increase in @xmath9 until it attains its maximum possible value ( carnot refrigerator ) as shown in fig .",
    "before we plot the phase diagrams showing regions where the model works as a heat engine , as a refrigerator and as neither of the two we think that it is illustrative to know how @xmath86 and @xmath87 behave with scaled load , @xmath72 .",
    "we introduce two scaled quantities @xmath88 and @xmath89 corresponding to @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "figs . 10a and 10b show plots of @xmath90 versus @xmath72 and @xmath91 versus @xmath72 , respectively , after fixing the other parameters .",
    "note that fig .",
    "10a shows that @xmath92 is always positive while figure 10b shows that @xmath93 takes a negative value within some interval values of @xmath72 .",
    "the quantity @xmath94 is always positive . in the region that @xmath93 is negative ,",
    "the model works neither as a heat engine nor as a refrigerator since under this situation external work is supplying energy to _ both _ the hot and cold reservoirs .",
    "we have found that when @xmath95 the model works as a heat engine while the model works as a refrigerator when @xmath96 the model works neither as a heat engine nor as a refrigerator if @xmath97    we plot the three operation regions of the model in fig .",
    "the figure demonstrates that in the parameter space of @xmath98 , the model works as a heat engine , as a refrigerator or as neither of the two for fixed @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "one can see in the phase diagram that for @xmath101 , the model works neither as a heat engine nor as a refrigerator when @xmath102 .",
    "in fact in this region , @xmath93 is negative as can be seen in fig.10b .",
    "figure 12 shows the three regions in @xmath103 parameters space in which the model operates as a heat engine , as a refrigerator and as neither of the two for fixed @xmath104 , @xmath53 , @xmath55and @xmath54 .",
    "we considered a simple model of a brownian heat engine and explored how current , efficiency and performance of a refrigerator behave as model parameters of interest vary . in the absence of external load ,",
    "the model works as a heat engine while in the presence of external load the model works as a heat engine , as a refrigerator or neither of the two depending on the values in the parameter space . at a quasistatic limit the efficiency as well as",
    "the cop of the engine goes to that of carnot efficiency and carnot cop . in this paper",
    "we reported an extended version of the work @xcite .",
    "the result we obtained shows that unlike the previous work , there are regions that the model may work neither as a heat engine nor as a refrigerator determined by the width of hot locality .    in this work , we found a closed expression for the steady state current .",
    "this enabled us to explore the energetics of the brownian heat engine not only at the quasistatic limits but also while operating at any finite time .",
    "this is a clear exposition of the power of having analytic expression for the concerned physical quantities .",
    "consider motion of a brownian particle in any periodic potential , @xmath16 , and temperature , t(x ) , profiles where both have the same periodic length of @xmath105 as shown in fig .",
