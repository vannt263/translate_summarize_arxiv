    "for a compact lie algebra @xmath0 , the question of finding possible spectra of the sum of two elements from @xmath1 has been answered in great details and turned out to be related to many different areas of mathematics , including representation theory , combinatorics , symplectic geometry , geometric invariant theory and others , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , the non - compact case seems to remain untouched , for a reason that the non - compact coadjoint orbits do not possess the necessary nice properties and the sum of two non - compact orbits can in general cover pretty much arbitrary spectra .    however , there is a class of coadjoint orbits in a quasi - hermitian semisimple lie algebra @xmath2 , which we call admissible , and which share certain properties of the compact case . for example , the moment map for the maximal torus action on such orbits is proper and the image is semi - bounded .",
    "the set of admissible orbits forms a double cone ( i.e. the union of a cone and its negative ) , and if we denote by @xmath3 the interior of one of its halves . in this setup",

    "for example , if @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive real numbers and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two matrices , which are @xmath9-conjugate to @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively , then possible eigenvalues @xmath12 of their sum @xmath13 must necessarily satisfy the reversed triangle inequality : @xmath14 .    in general , given two admissible @xmath15 with prescribed spectra @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively ,",
    "we show that the possible spectra of @xmath13 belong to a convex polyhedral set @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the polytope that solves the problem for the maximal compact subalgebra @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the cone defined by the positive non - compact roots .",
    "the main ingredients here are the weinstein s generalization of the kirwan convexity theorem for semisimple lie groups @xcite , the hilgert - neeb - plank abelian convexity theorem for non - compact manifolds @xcite , the bates - lerman local normal form @xcite , and the sjamaar s construction of local cones @xcite .    in the last section",

    "now , combining this with the commutativity of reduction in stages , we are able to compute the local moment cones .",
    "let us first describe the hamiltonian structure on @xmath149 more explicitly .",
    "the manifold @xmath150 carries a natural closed two - form ( the minimal - coupling form , see @xcite ) , which is non - degenerate in a @xmath65-invariant neighborhood of @xmath151 .",
    "now , identifying @xmath152 with @xmath153 by means of left translations , the action of @xmath154 on @xmath149 is given by : @xmath155 which is hamiltonian with the moment map : @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the moment map for the linear symplectic action of @xmath110 on @xmath158 and @xmath159 is the natural projection .",
    "note , since both @xmath111 and @xmath110 are compact , @xmath160 is proper .",

    "therefore @xmath164 descends to the following @xmath65-equivariant diffeomorphism : @xmath168 now , using the equivariant darboux theorem , one can see that this map is in fact a symplectomorphism . if we perform the above reduction in stages , namely first with respect to @xmath110 , and then by @xmath111 , we can present @xmath146 as an iterated bundle : @xmath169 over the coadjoint orbit , diffeomorphic to @xmath170 , with the fiber @xmath171 .",
    "the space @xmath172 is a hamiltonian @xmath111-space with the moment map @xmath173 , which is a restriction of @xmath99 to @xmath172 .",

    ", @xmath176 is a slice at @xmath126 for a coadjoint action on @xmath177 .",
    "thus , restricting @xmath178 to a sufficiently small @xmath65-invariant neighborhood of @xmath179 $ ] , we obtain a @xmath65-equivariant embedding into an open neighborhood of @xmath126 .",
    "hence there is a @xmath65-invariant neighborhood @xmath130 of @xmath180 $ ] in @xmath146 , so that @xmath99 becomes the bundle map of associated bundles over @xmath181 .",
    "therefore @xmath182 , and the image @xmath183 is a bundle over @xmath184 with the fiber @xmath185 .",
    "if @xmath130 is small enough , we get : @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the moment image of @xmath188 as a hamiltonian @xmath111-space .",
    "hence the description of local moment map reduces to computing the local moment map of the hamiltonian @xmath111-space @xmath172 .",
    "note that since @xmath111 compact and @xmath185 is proper , we can use the vertex criterion given in ( * ? ? ?",

    "the space @xmath172 is a symplectic quotient of @xmath193 by @xmath110 with the moment map : @xmath194 where we shifted the moment map by @xmath126 .",
    "let us assume that @xmath110 is abelian , which is the case for an open dense set of elements in @xmath104 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the isotropy group @xmath111 , which contains @xmath110 , is a subgroup of @xmath66 for a dense open subset of elements @xmath195 .",
    "therefore we can think of @xmath110 as a subgroup of @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath110-moment map image of @xmath158 is the cone : @xmath196 where @xmath197 are the weights of the representation of @xmath110 on @xmath158 .",
    "for @xmath198 , consider the coadjoint orbit @xmath199 through @xmath89 .",
    "if we regard @xmath200 as a hamiltonian @xmath111-space and reduce it with respect to @xmath111 , we obtain @xmath201 .",
    "it is a hamiltonian @xmath110-space with the moment map ] thus the reduction of @xmath201 with respect to @xmath202 is non - empty if and only if : @xmath203 if we regard @xmath200 as a @xmath110-space and first reduce with respect to @xmath204 to obtain @xmath205 , and then reduce with respect to @xmath206 , then we obtain the very same space , according to the general result for reduction in stages @xcite .",
    "hence this space is non - empty if and only if @xmath207 is in the moment image of @xmath205 .",
    "this implies that the local moment cone is the set : @xmath208 or , equivalently , that there is some neighborhood @xmath130 of @xmath126 in @xmath136 such that : @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the natural projection . combining this with the previously mentioned theorem of weinstein @xcite , which also asserts the connectedness of the fibers of @xmath211",

    ", we deduce that @xmath220 .",
    "hence we have : @xmath221 on the other hand , the cones at the extremal points have a very simple form . using ( * ? ? ? * remark 5.18 ) for the moment map image of coadjoint orbits , the cone at those points is given by @xmath222 .",

    "let @xmath238 be a dominant integral weight with respect to the compact positive roots and let @xmath158 be a irreducible unitary @xmath135-module with highest weight @xmath239 .",
