    "hot massive stars have a great impact on the surrounding interstellar medium ( _ ism _ ) and play a crucial role in the chemical evolution of galaxies .",
    "their strong ultraviolet radiation is responsible for the ionization of nearby @xmath1 regions where their stellar winds blow vast bubbles .",
    "their supersonic wind outflows and the supernova explosion at the end of their evolution transfer energy and momentum to the _ ism _ and disperse the material processed in the stellar interiors , thus setting the conditions for the formation of subsequent generations of stars .",
    "the determination of the physical parameters of massive stars is therefore of great interest , yet complicated .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy is needed .",
    "modeling the stellar atmosphere requires to account for the expanding wind , the non local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) conditions and the so called line - blanketing that modifies the flux distribution , especially at short wavelengths .",
    "spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and far ultraviolet ranges ( hereafter uv and far - uv ) is a powerful tool to study the winds of massive stars since these spectral regions contain the resonance lines of the most abundant ions in the wind . in this work",
    "we analyse spectra from the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) @xcite , covering the 905 - 1187region , in conjunction with spectra at longer wavelengths ( 1200 - 2000 ) from the _ international ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ iue _ ) , the _ orbiting retrievable far and extreme ultraviolet spectrometers _ ( _ orfeus _ ) and the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _",

    "hd  93205 and hd  168076 , the unsaturated profile may also be due to flux from the cooler companion star , whose contribution we estimate to be @xmath38 15% of the observed flux . a comparison of _ wm - basic _ and _ cmfgen _ models calculated with parameters suitable for the early - o type stars is under way ( @xcite ; bianchi , garcia , & herald , in preparation ) , to investigate the effect of a different treatement of the shocks on the  @xmath201238.8,1242.8 doublet .",
    "we compile previous determinations of the stellar parameters for our program stars from the literature in table [ t_prev ] .",
    "our effective temperatures are consistently lower than those derived in other works , with the only exception of the strmgren and h@xmath63 photometric studies by @xcite and @xcite . @xcite derived temperatures for the carina stars of our sample lower than ours by @xmath154,000  k on average .",
    "@xcite assigned a temperature of 28,200  k to hd  190429 ( without resolving the system ) , closer to what we would expect for the secondary than to what we found for hd  190429a ( 37,500  k ) . @xcite performed strmgren and h@xmath63 photometry of hd  168076 and derived a temperature higher than ours by 16,000  k. the calibration of @xcite , based on the comparison of the equivalent widths of hydrogen and helium lines with plane - parallel hydrostatic non - lte model predictions , was used by @xcite and @xcite for several objects of our sample , yielding temperatures higher than our results by @xmath51 10,000  k. temperatures obtained from fitting balmer lines and optical and lines with plane - parallel non - lte hydrostatic models are @xmath15 10% @xcite to @xmath1520% @xcite higher than ours .",
    "@xcite compared the _ iue _ spectrum of hd  93250 to _ wm - basic _ models of = 50,000  k ( approximately the same as derived by @xcite ) ,  = 4.0 and = 12 , with different mass - loss rates around @xmath33=5.6@xmath54m@xmath36 yr@xmath19 .",
    "their synthetic spectra did not include shocks effects and either produce  @xmath51371.0 in excess or can not reproduce the  @xmath201718.0,1718.5 line .",
    "in our work we used those lines , together with  @xmath51169 +  @xmath51176 and  @xmath201118.0,1128.0 , to set the upper limit of the effective temperature of the dwarf stars to @xmath1542,000  k ( see section [ s_models ] ) and we obtained a consistent fit of all spectral features by including the effects of shocks in the calculations .    in figure [ tefflum ]",
    "we compare the effective temperatures and luminosities obtained for the total sample of o3-o7 type stars analysed in this work and in paper  i with previous empirical calibrations ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "our   values for o3-o6 dwarf stars are lower than these calibrations , the differences ranging between 9,000 - 10,000  k , 6,000 - 9,000  k and 4,000 - 7,000  k respectively .",
    "the discrepancy is smaller for the o4-o7 supergiants ( 6,000 - 10,000  k , 4,000 - 6,000  k and 2,000 - 3,500  k , respectively ) .",
    "the derived luminosities for both dwarf stars and supergiants are also lower , by an average of 7% and 10% respectively , than both the calibrations of @xcite and @xcite . for the o4  if@xmath0 supergiant",
    "the luminosity is also lower , but the discrepancy is within the error bars .",
    "the lower temperatures from our analysis are due to two main improvements .",
    "on the one hand , the use of _ fuse _ data enables the assessment of x - rays from shocks and thus a correct ( consistent ) derivation of the wind ionization . on the other hand , the inclusion of line - blanketing effects in the analysis yields lower effective temperatures than pure hydrogen and helium model analyses .",
    "optical spectra analyses of massive stars with spherical , hydrodynamic , wind - blanketed , non - lte synthetic spectra also revised the temperature scale downwards @xcite .",
    "our derived   values are still lower . temperatures of o3  v and o4  v stars , according to the scale of @xcite ( based on calculations with the cmfgen code ) are @xmath2147,500  k and @xmath2144,500  k , whereas we have obtained 41,000  k and 40,000 - 39,000  k. from the work of @xcite , who fit balmer , and optical lines with fastwind @xcite , we can interpolate a temperature of 41,250  k for an o4  if@xmath0 , i.e. @xmath154,000  k higher than we derived for hd  190429a .",
    "@xcite , proceeding similarly , obtained 46,000  k for hd  93250 ( in contrast with our result , 40,000  k ) and 41,000  k for hde  303308 ( in agreement within the error bars with our value , 40,000  k ) .",
    "the remaining disagreement between these results and ours may originate in the fact that the analyses are based on optical and uv data respectively .",
    "we are planning to analyse optical spectra of the sample stars to check the consistency of our results from the uv and far - uv .",
    "the spectral lines in the fuse and iue ranges constrain @xmath33   as well .",
    "the mass - loss rate we derived for hd  190429a ( 1.2@xmath55m@xmath36 yr@xmath19 ) agrees with the values derived from h@xmath17 by @xcite ( @xmath64m@xmath36 yr@xmath19 ) , @xcite ( 1.26@xmath55m@xmath36 yr@xmath19 ) , @xcite ( 8.6@xmath54m@xmath36 yr@xmath19 ) and @xcite ( @xmath65m@xmath36 yr@xmath19 ) .",

    "* ir ) . for the dwarf stars the mass - loss rates derived in the literature are at least one order of magnitude higher than ours . for hd  93250 ,",
    "the exceptionally high value of @xmath33=@xmath67 @xcite was determined from radio fluxes at 8.54 ghz , but the data may be contaminated by non - thermal emission ; for this object , there is also one measurement lower than ours by one order of magnitude . in view of the systematic differences for dwarf stars , we used the `` recipe '' of @xcite , based on the radiation pressure driven wind theory , to predict the mass - loss rates of the sample stars from their derived photospheric parameters .",
    "the predictions are presented in table [ t_models ] .",
    "the mass - loss rate derived for hd  190429a agrees with the prediction . for dwarf",
    "stars our values are lower than predicted by a factor of @xmath152 ( @xmath154 for hd  64568 ) .    in general ,",
    "the stellar masses we have obtained are lower than values determined in previous works , as shown in table [ t_prev ] . in the case of hd  93205 ,",
    "the mass had been derived from the orbital parameters of the binary system : @xmath37 31.5 @xcite , @xmath37 32.6 @xcite , @xmath37 37 @xcite . for this star",
    "we derive 30@xmath68 , lower than previous determinations but compatible within the errors . the primary mass yields a mass of the secondary of 13@xmath69   for a mass ratio of q=0.423 @xcite , a mass significantly lower than derived for other o8  v stars in eclipsing systems like , for example , dn  cas , for which @xcite give 24 .",
    "however , it must be emphasized here that the uncertainty in  and   ( see section [ s_fit_v ] ) makes the derived value of the stellar masses much more uncertain than other parameters ( like   and @xmath33 ) .",
    "hopefully the mass determination will be refined with a consistent analysis of optical spectra , planned as a future work .",
    "our results improve the empirical calibration of the wind momentum - luminosity relation ( wlr ) .",
    "the wlr relates the so - called modified wind momentum @xmath70 @xmath33@xmath71 to the luminosity of the star as @xmath72 @xcite . in the past few years",
    "a big effort has been made to calibrate the wlr @xcite for its promising application to distance determinations . in figure [ windmom ]",
    "we plot the wlr for the total sample of stars studied in this paper and in paper  i. our points are mostly consistent with the theoretical relation of @xcite within the error bars .",
    "we are planning to extend our modeling of far - uv and uv spectra to a larger sample of o type stars and to the optical range .",
    "the lower   values ( compared with previous results / calibrations ) have great implications for understanding the ionisation of @xmath1 regions , since cooler stars would produce less photons energetic enough to ionize hydrogen ( @xmath73 912 ) .",
    "for instance , the ionizing flux from a star of = 40,000  k amounts to only 30% of the flux from a = 50,000  k star with the same radius .",
    "we are indebted to adi pauldrach for assisting us with the use of the _ wm - basic _ code .",
    "this work is based on data obtained by the nasa - cnes - csa _ fuse _ mission operated by the johns hopkins university .",
    "the data from the _ iue _ satellite presented in this paper were obtained from both the ines archive and the multimission archive at the space telescope science institute ( mast ) .",
