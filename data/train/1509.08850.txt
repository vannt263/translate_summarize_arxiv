    "before diving into mathematical details , it is useful to summarize the main result , which is really quite simple if we allow ourselves to ignore some technical matters we will discuss later on . the treatment here is non - relativistic , so transformations between frames are galilean .    start with the wave equation for acoustic waves in a _ uniform _ and _ stationary _ background .",

    "an avoided crossing type of behavior is present at the resonance , where @xmath26 , but there is an additional branch where @xmath27 is present as well , so this is not tunneling of the standard type .",

    "we want to view @xmath30 as a function of the variables @xmath19 which form a conjugate pair on the _ ray phase space_. the frequency @xmath3 appears as a parameter .    in wkb theory ,",
    "the dispersion function @xmath30 is the ray hamiltonian . in a two - dimensional ray phase space ,",
    "the zero locus of the hamiltonian ( @xmath5 ) is also the set of rays . for example , in figure  ( [ fig : dispersion2kv ] ) we show the rays near the event horizion @xmath31 for the special case where @xmath32 , and a linear velocity profile , @xmath33 , hence the event horizon is at @xmath34 .",
    "the arrows on the rays indicate the direction of the ray evolution given by hamilton s equations  @xcite ( subscripts denote partial derivatives ) : @xmath35    the smooth central branch that passes near the origin is a right - moving wave associated with the root @xmath36 .",
    "this is the ` incoming ' wave .",
    "a little algebra shows that the group velocity for this wave @xmath37 at the event horizon .",
    "the other branch , associated with @xmath38 , forms an avoided crossing , typical of tunneling . for those branches of the dispersion surface , as @xmath25 approaches zero @xmath39 .",
    "the hamilton equations for these rays show that disturbances propagate from large- to small-@xmath4 , meaning that to find the disturbances that escape from the vicinity of the event horizon into the subsonic region ( to the left in figure  [ fig : dispersion2kv ] ) we must specify initial data on the rays _ at _ the event horizon . upon discretization",
    ", we have found the high-@xmath4 behavior changes dramatically ( as will be discussed in a separate paper ) , hence it would be good to avoid having to specify our initial data in that region , if possible , a point made by unruh and jacobson previously .",
    "we should also note that @xmath39 is usually interpreted as the signature of a ` resonance . '",
    "however , there is nothing fundamental in a mathematical sense about this characterization , since @xmath40 going to infinity at a particular point in @xmath25 can be removed by a linear canonical transformation .",
    "for example , we can use the linear symplectic transformation given in  ( [ eq : rotation ] ) , which we will discuss momentarily . a more invariant way to characterize a resonance using normal form theory",
    "is given in chapter 6 of  @xcite , and we will use that method here .    as will be shown in section  [ sec : wkb ] , the wkb - based intuition reflected in the expression  ( [ eq : dispersionintro ] ) is valid _ away _ from the event horizon , but it breaks down in the immediate vicinity of the horizon because wkb is invalid there .",
    "a local treatment must be developed in order to compute the @xmath1-matrix connecting incoming and outgoing wkb solutions .",
    "we summarize the approach here briefly , with details given in later sections of the paper .",
    "the linearized equations of one - dimensional gas dynamics , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : continuity1])-([eq : pressure1 ] ) , will be derived from a variational principle  ( [ eq : variational1 ] ) , and a hamiltonian field theory is then developed using standard methods .",
    "the canonical field variables are the particle displacement , @xmath41 , and the momentum density , @xmath42 . written in terms of this canonical formulation , time evolution",
    "is governed by a @xmath0 schrdinger - type equation  ( [ eq : schrodingerform ] ) .",
    "the associated @xmath0 weyl symbol is [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : schrodingereq ] ) and  ( [ eq : symbold ] ) ] : @xmath43 to focus on the key points of this heuristic discussion here , we simplify by setting the density @xmath44 equal to unity , ignoring moyal terms in the product @xmath45 ( defined in  ( [ eq : moyal ] ) below ) , and using a constant sound speed .    notice that the symbol matrix @xmath46 is _ not _ self - adjoint , but it becomes self - adjoint ( for real @xmath25 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 ) when we multiply it by @xmath47 times the symplectic matrix , @xmath48 , defined in  ( [ eq : symplecticj ] ) .",
    "this important fact is a general characteristic of brizard s theory  @xcite .    to isolate the tunneling process as much as possible , we need to bring the symbol matrix  ( [ eq : asymbol ] ) into normal form .",
    "then the @xmath0 operator associated with that symbol will provide us with the simplest _ local wave equation _ , valid in the immediate vicinity of the event horizon .    to compute the normal form , we start with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the _ non - self - adjoint _ @xmath46 .",
    "the eigenvalues are : @xmath49,\\ ] ] with the associated eigenvectors @xmath50 note that the @xmath51 sign convention has been chosen to denote the eigenvalue and polarization associated with @xmath52 .",
    "the eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal with respect to the complex form of the symplectic inner product , defined as @xmath53 that is @xmath54 .",
    "we have normalized them so @xmath55 .",
    "let s focus on the event horizon that occurs when @xmath31 . in that case ,",
    "the dispersion function @xmath56 is the one associated with the tunneling . for simplicity ,",
    "let s assume once more that @xmath57 is constant , choose our origin such that this occurs at @xmath34 , and linearize @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the length scale characteristic of the flow at the event horizon .",
    "this implies @xmath61 the zero locus in @xmath25 and @xmath4 of @xmath62 , for @xmath63 , has the characteristic avoided - crossing ( hyperbolic ) shape for the rays .",
    "we will discuss this more in a moment .    returning to the normal form calculation",
    ": for a fixed ( but arbitrary ) frequency @xmath3 , choose @xmath64 by solving @xmath65 : @xmath66 now construct the _ constant _ ( in @xmath25 and @xmath4 ) matrix @xmath67 from the eigenvectors : @xmath68 note that @xmath69 is not unitary , but instead satisfies @xmath70 note also that @xmath69 is non - invertible when @xmath71 .",
    "this is a singular limit , reflected in the fact that  ( [ eq : qdagjq ] ) remains true for all @xmath63 .",
    "the next step is to compute the new symbol matrix @xmath72 this new matrix is self - adjoint by construction because @xmath73 is self - adjoint for all real @xmath25 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "it is important to note the use of a _ congruence _ transformation here , not a similarity transformation .",
    "the reason that a congruence appears here is that we derive the wave operator [ in section  [ sec:1dhydro ] , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : action1 ] ) ] from a variational principle , which for the linearized dynamics is a bi - linear form .",
    "more details regarding the appearance of congruence transformations in ray phase space methods for multicomponent wave equations can be found in appendix c.2 of  @xcite .",
    "we should note that _ diagonalizing _",
    "@xmath74 , as opposed to bringing it into normal form , requires use of the eigenvectors of @xmath75 , not @xmath46 .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath74 are @xmath25- and @xmath4-dependent .",
    "this leads to problems when we try to apply the congruence transformation within the variational principle  ( [ eq : action1 ] ) , because the entries of the congruence transformation @xmath76 become operators , not constants  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the eigenvalues of @xmath74 are complicated functions of @xmath25 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 , because they include the coupling .",
    "the coupling mixes the different wave behaviors and makes physical interpretation more difficult .",
    "the normal form , in contrast , isolates as much as possible the _ uncoupled _ dispersion functions , closely related to  ( [ eq : dplusminus ] ) .",
    "the next step in the normal form calculation is to taylor expand @xmath74 about @xmath77 , writing @xmath78 .",
    "we keep only the leading terms in @xmath79 in each of the four entries .",
    "( higher order corrections can , of course be included if they are deemed necessary .",
    "see  @xcite for a discussion . ) after a little algebra , we find @xmath80 we identify @xmath81 and @xmath82 as the uncoupled dispersion functions at the event horizon , and @xmath83 is the coupling between them .",
    "( note that the eigenvalues of @xmath84 given in  ( [ eq : dplusminus ] ) , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , depend upon @xmath4 , while @xmath81 and @xmath82 depend upon @xmath79 . )",
    "the coupling is usually evaluated at the base point of the taylor expansion in ray phase space [ here @xmath87 , setting it equal to a constant value  @xcite .",
    "this simplification is often sufficient to get good results .",
    "but in the present case , setting @xmath88 implies zero coupling .",
    "we carry the coupling term along to remind ourselves it is not exactly zero .",
    "neglect of the coupling is required to recover the hawking result outlined below .",
    "the entry @xmath81 is the dispersion function for a right - moving wave with group velocity @xmath89 at the event horizon , as can easily be verified using the hamilton equations with @xmath81 as ray hamiltonian .",
    "this is the ` incoming wave ' .",
    "the entry @xmath82 is the wave undergoing tunneling when @xmath90 .",
    "we now consider this avoided crossing separately .",
    "@xmath91 we emphasize once more that while @xmath56 in  ( [ eq : dminus ] ) is an eigenvalue of @xmath84 , @xmath92 is a diagonal element of the normal form  ( [ eq : normalform ] ) , and a function of @xmath93 , not @xmath4 .",
    "the ray equations , using @xmath82 as the ray hamiltonian , are : @xmath94 this implies that disturbances that start near @xmath95 at very small spatial scales ( large @xmath40 ) propagate toward smaller @xmath40 , while moving away from the origin in @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , the ray starting with @xmath95 and large _ negative _ @xmath4 leaves the region of the resonance traveling to the left , i.e. it ` escapes ' from the event horizon and propagates into the subsonic region @xmath96 .",
    "now consider the following linear canonical transformation : @xmath97 this is a rotation by @xmath98 , and it puts  ( [ eq : db ] ) into the tunneling normal form ( see , for example , page 243 , eq .",
    "( 6.41 ) , and figure 6.7 on page 244 of  @xcite ) : @xmath99.\\ ] ]    linear canonical transformations on ray phase space induce related unitary transformations in the associated hilbert space of wave functions .",
    "this change of representation is a generalization of the fourier transform , called the _",
    "for example , the unitary transform that takes wave functions in the @xmath25-representation to wave functions in the @xmath100-representation is : @xmath101 where @xmath102 the inverse of  ( [ eq : metaplecticxx ] ) is simply @xmath103 see appendix e of  @xcite for details .    because @xmath100 and @xmath104 form a canonical pair , if we choose the @xmath100-representation to write our wave equation , we have the familiar association @xmath105 implying that the equation governing the mode shape for frequency @xmath3 is : @xmath106\\psi(x)+\\frac{\\partial ^2\\psi}{\\partial x^2}=0.\\ ] ] the solution of this equation can be written in terms of parabolic cylinder functions , and the @xmath1-matrix elements connecting incoming and outgoing rays computed .",
    "the transmission coefficient ( relating the outgoing and incoming _ amplitude _ on the ray ) is @xmath107 ( note that in the case of tunneling the incoming ray connects smoothly to the _ transmitted _ ray , not the converted ray .",
    "see section 6.2 and problems 6.4 and 6.5 of  @xcite for details . )    as already mentioned , the linear canonical transformation  ( [ eq : rotation ] ) from @xmath108 generates a unitary transformation on the hilbert space of wave functions .",
    "therefore , so long as we keep track of incoming and outgoing pairings ( using the rays ) , the @xmath1-matrix elements are unchanged .",
    "this allows us to compute the connection coefficients for the original @xmath25-representation    the _ energy _ associated with the outgoing transmitted ray is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude , so it is related to the energy on the incoming ray using @xmath109 .",
    "total energy is conserved , so the energy on the _ converted _ ray is proportional to @xmath110 . in figure  [ fig : dispersion2kv ] we show , for example , the energies for the transmitted and converted rays for an initial disturbance that starts with unit amplitude and large _ negative _ @xmath4 .    to this point , these results are entirely classical .",
    "the connection with ` hawking radiation ' from a black hole is through the following analogy .",
    "rewrite the exponent in the _ energy _ transmission coefficient as [ from  ( [ eq : tau ] ) we find @xmath111 : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is planck s constant , @xmath114 is boltzmann s constant , and @xmath115 is an ` effective temperature ' : @xmath116 note that this effective temperature is inversely proportional to the length scale .",
    "( in the famous result by hawking , the effective temperature of a black hole is inversely proprtional to the mass , while the schwarzschild radius is proportional to the mass .",
    "this means that the temperature and characteristic length scale at the event horizon are in the same inverse relation as here . )",
    "if we consider laboratory acoustics and transitional flow , for example with jet nozzles , we can choose approximate values for the transition region at the throat of the nozzle .",
    "for example , following unruh , we choose the length scale @xmath117 , and the sound speed , @xmath118 .",
    "this gives @xmath119 implying that we can only observe the ` thermal ' character of the emission if we look in the mhz range of frequencies , and this in an extremely turbulent environment .",
    "( unruh  @xcite acknowledges that this is a challenging measurement to make , though he points out that it is easier than using a laboratory - scale black hole ! )    our primary interest in this paper is in the theoretical formalism , in particular an examination of the unruh model from the perspective of ray phase space .",
    "the normal form method presented here requires a modification of earlier methods , and the symplectic inner product  ( [ eq : sympinner ] ) plays a key role , which is new .",
    "the extension used here should be applicable to other problems where this symplectic structure appears ( e.g. all those covered by brizard s theory of linearized mhd ) .",
    "this completes our summary of the main points .",
    "we now move to the derivation of the acoustic model from one - dimensional gas dynamics , the canonical formulation , and wkb .",
    "the approach followed here is a special case of the general theory presented in brizard  @xcite .",
    "we use a cold ideal fluid model in one spatial dimension , @xmath25 , which has as dependent variables the density , @xmath120 , the velocity , @xmath121 , and the pressure @xmath122 .",
    "these quantities obey the following evolution equations : @xmath123 @xmath124 and @xmath125 where the subscripts denote partial derivatives and @xmath126 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "we recognize the first equation as the statement of mass conservation , the second of momentum conservation , and the third is required for the evolution following fluid trajectories to be adiabatic with the equation of state @xmath127 .",
    "it is important to note that the derivation of the acoustic model given below is non - physical in the sense that we start with nonlinear one - dimensional inviscid fluid flow , then linearize around a given ( time stationary ) spatial profile in density and background flow .",
    "this means that we are ignoring the formation of shocks , which are well - known to occur in this system of pdes .",
    "now linearize eqs .",

    "the constant @xmath131 is a formal expansion parameter .",
    "expand in powers of @xmath131 and collect terms .",
    "the zeroth order equilibrium must satisfy @xmath132 we note that the last condition , combined with the first , implies @xmath133 .",
    "notice , further , that these equilibrium conditions imply that the pressure , density , and velocity profiles are not independent . in particular , the sound speed profile is [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : soundspeed2 ] ) ] : @xmath134 this is not independent of the background velocity profile , @xmath135 .",
    "a little algebra shows that @xmath136 this , of course , does not preclude these two velocities from becoming equal one another , which is the situation of interest to us .    at first order in @xmath131",
    "we have @xmath137 ( n.b .",
    "the first term on the rhs of eq .",
    "( [ eq : momentum1 ] ) is missing in eq.(15 ) of  @xcite . ) following brizard , we now replace the three fields @xmath138 with the first order particle displacement @xmath139 .",
    "the variations in the field quantities are determined by the particle motions through the following identities @xmath140    these identities are inserted into the first - order evolution equations to derive the evolution equation for the particle displacement . in particular , the first - order momentum conservation law  ( [ eq : momentum1 ] ) becomes , after some straightforward but lengthy algebra , @xmath141 note that this result requires use of the zeroth order equilibrium conditions  ( [ eq : density0 ] ) and  ( [ eq : energy0 ] ) .",
    "note also that  ( [ eq : xievolution ] ) agrees with eq .  ( 22 ) of brizard  @xcite , when that expression is reduced to one spatial dimension , and zero magnetic field .",

    "we will report on this elsewhere .                  in this paper , to be consistent with much of the literature on the topic , we use the term _ tunneling _ to refer to a process whereby one incoming ray",
    "can ` split ' into two outgoing rays , but that only a single polarization is involved , hence the problem can locally be reduced to a scalar one by galerkin methods . if two polarizations are involved in the resonance , then we can only reduce the problem to a local @xmath0 representation , which is called _",
