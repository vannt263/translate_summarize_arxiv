    "the handlebody group is finitely presented .",
    "thus @xmath8 can be equipped with a word norm that is unique up to quasi - isometry .",
    "hence , the handlebody group carries a well - defined large - scale geometry .",
    "however , this large scale geometry is not compatible with the large - scale geometry of the ambient group @xmath7 .",
    "namely , we showed in @xcite that the handlebody group is an exponentially distorted subgroup of the mapping class group of the boundary surface for every genus @xmath9 . here ,",
    "a finitely generated subgroup @xmath10 of a finitely generated group @xmath11 is called _ exponentially distorted _ if the following holds .",

    ", there is no such bound with sub - exponential growth rate .    as a consequence ,",
    "it is not possible to directly transfer geometric properties from the mapping class group to the handlebody group . in this note",
    "we initiate an investigation of the intrinsic large - scale geometry of the handlebody group .",
    "a particularly useful geometric invariant of a finitely presented group @xmath11 is its _ dehn function _ , which can be defined as the isoperimetric function of a presentation complex for @xmath11 ( see section  [ s : upperbound - and - dehn - function ] for a complete definition ) .",
    "although the dehn function itself depends on the choice of a finite presentation of @xmath11 , the growth type of the dehn function does not .",

    "the mapping class group @xmath7 of @xmath4 is automatic @xcite and hence has quadratic dehn function .",

    "the dehn function of the outer automorphism group @xmath16 of a free group @xmath17 on @xmath5 generators is exponential @xcite .",
    "however , since the kernel of the projection from the handlebody group to @xmath18 is infinitely generated @xcite , this fact also does not restrict the dehn function of @xmath8 .",
    "the goal of this note is to give an upper bound for the dehn function of @xmath6 .",
    "we show    [ dehn ] the handlebody group @xmath6 satisfies an exponential isoperimetric inequality , i.e. the growth of its dehn function is at most exponential .",
    "the strategy of proof for theorem  [ dehn ] is similar to the strategy employed in @xcite to show an exponential upper bound for the dehn function of outer automorphism groups of free groups .",
    "we construct a graph which is a geometric model for the handlebody group ( a similar construction is used in @xcite in order to show exponential distortion of handlebody groups ) .",

    "a simple disk system is a collection of pairwise disjoint , pairwise non - homotopic embedded disks in @xmath0 which decompose @xmath0 into simply connected regions .",
    "we then use a a surgery procedure for disk systems to define a distinguished class of paths in this geometric model .",
    "although these paths are in general not quasi - geodesics for the handlebody group ( see the example at the end of this note ) , they are sufficiently well - behaved so that they can be used to fill a cycle with area bounded by an exponential function in the length of the cycle .",
    "the organization of this note is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce disk systems and special paths in the disk system graph .",

    "note that minimal position of disks is not unique ; in particular the intersection pattern @xmath25 is not determined by the isotopy classes of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
