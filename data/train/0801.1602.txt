    "under the usual assumptions of optical pumping and/or coherent population trapping , the lindblach - kossakowski master equation describing the dynamics of the density operator admits multiple time - scales . in this paper , we are studying the fast / slow structure resulting from a separation between    * the life - times of the excited and unstable states assumed to be short . *",
    "the oscillation periods , assumed to be long , associated to the energies of the other stable states and to the rabi pulsation generated by the control , coupling the unstable and stable states in a quasi - resonant way .",
    "usually , the elimination of the fast dynamics is performed in terms of coherence vector gathering in a single column the coefficients of the density matrix . in this form",
    ", the system is not written in a standard form  @xcite ( also called tikhonov normal form ) with a clear splitting of the coherence vector into two sub - vectors : a fast sub - vector and a slow one . some tedious linear algebra and changes of variables",
    "are then needed to put the system into the standard form in order to perform the adiabatic ( quasi - static approximation ) elimination of the fast dynamics .",
    "moreover with such coherence vector we loose the physical interpretation of the master equation in terms of hamiltonian and jump operators , explained in  @xcite .",
    "the main contribution of this note is to propose a more intrinsic elimination of the fast part of the dynamics by using only matrix manipulations for systems with a structure sketched on figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "the main theoretical guide is the geometric theory of singularly perturbed differential systems initiated in  @xcite and center manifold techniques to approximate the invariant slow manifold  @xcite .",
    "such theoretical guides have been already used in  @xcite in the context of reduction of kinetics combustion schemes .",
    "these guides avoid here the use of the coherence vector and provide a slow dynamics that is also a markovian master equation of lindbald - kossakowski type with a slow hamiltonian and slow jump operators .",
    "this slow master equation describes the dynamics of the density matrix of the open quantum system that lives in the hilbert space spanned by the stable states .",
    "as far as we know , such formulation of the slow dynamics is new , even in the physicist community , and could be of some interest for the control .",
    "in particular , the controls appear explicitly in the decoherence terms and the output map .",
    "the note is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec:3scales ] is devoted to the modeling of systems depicted on figure  [ fig : model ] , to the three time - scales structure and to the elimination ( by averaging , i.e. , by the rotating wave approximation usually used by physicists ) of the fastest time - scale attached to the transition frequencies between the stable and unstable states .",
    "the resulting model , equation   with complex value controls @xmath0 and measured output @xmath1 , still admits two time - scales , an asymptotically stable fast part and a slow part .",
    "extraction of the slow part is the object of section  [ sec : adi ] where the approximation theorem  [ thm : main ] is proved . for readers not interested by these technical developments , we have summarized at the end of this section  [ sec : adi ] the main formula for deriving the slow master equation   from the original slow / fast one . in section  [ sec : phys ] , we compute the slow approximation when the hamiltonian @xmath2 corresponds to   and provides physical interpretations in terms of slow hamiltonian and slow jump operator depending directly on the control amplitudes @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : num ] , we compare , numerically on a five - level system , the slow / fast master equation with the slow one .    a preliminary version of these results can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the authors thank guilhem dubois from lkb for several discussions on the physics underlying coherence population trapping .",
    "such master equations typically describe coherent population trapping when a laser irradiates an @xmath3-level system  @xcite .",
    "the system is composed of @xmath4 ( fine or hyperfine ) ground states @xmath5 having energy separations in the radio - frequency or microwave region , and an excited state @xmath6 coupled to the lower ones by optical transitions at frequencies @xmath7 ( see figure  [ fig : model ] ) .",
    "naturally , the decay times for the optical coherences are assumed to be much shorter than those corresponding to the ground state transitions ( here assumed to be metastable ) .",
    "the quantum markovian master equation of lindblad - kossakowski type , modeling the evolution of a statistical ensemble of identical systems given by figure  [ fig : model ] , reads ( see  @xcite for a tutorial and up - to - date exposure on such master equations ) : @xmath8 \\notag    \\\\&\\quad    + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^n   \\gamma_k ( 2q_k\\rho q_k^\\dag - q_k^\\dag q_k\\rho-\\rho q_k^\\dag",

    "the hermitian operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the free hamiltonian and the interaction hamiltonian with a coherent source of photons @xmath13 : @xmath14 the @xmath15 being coupling and constant parameters . moreover , the quantum jump operators @xmath16 corresponding to the spontaneous emission from the state @xmath6 towards @xmath17 are given as follows @xmath18 one easily has the following relations @xmath19 the transition frequencies , @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the eigenvalues of @xmath23 corresponding to the energy levels @xmath6 and @xmath17 , respectively ) , are supposed to be much larger than the decoherence rates @xmath24 .",
    "the control field @xmath25 is assumed to be in the quasi - resonant regime with respect to the natural frequencies of the system : @xmath26 where the complex amplitudes @xmath27 are varying slowly and where @xmath28 are the small de - tuning frequencies .",
    "we have thus three different time scales :    1 .   the very fast time - scale associated to the optical frequencies @xmath29 .",
    "2 .   the fast time - scale associated to the life times of the excited state @xmath6 , @xmath24 .",
    "3 .   the slow time - scale associated to the laser amplitude @xmath30 and to the other atomic transition frequencies @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "we are interested here by the slow time - scale of system   where the control @xmath25 is given by   with the following time - scales separation : @xmath33 with @xmath34 , @xmath32 .",
    "elimination of the fastest time - scales is standard .",
    "it corresponds to the so - called rotating wave approximation and can be justified by averaging techniques .",
    "this is not the object of this note and thus we just recall here the resulting master equation : @xmath35+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k=1}^n \\gamma_k ( 2q_k\\rho q_k^\\dag - q_k^\\dag q_k\\rho-\\rho q_k^\\dag q_k).\\ ] ] calculating the secular terms of @xmath36 , the effective hamiltonian @xmath2 is given as follows : @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",

    "we can therefore take @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a small positive parameter .",
    "thus we have a master equation with the following structure : @xmath45+\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{\\overline\\gamma_k } { 2\\epsilon}(2q_k\\rho q_k^\\dag - q_k^\\dag q_k\\rho-\\rho q_k^\\dag q_k),\\ ] ] where @xmath46 s and @xmath2 ( given by   for example ) have the same orders of magnitude but where @xmath47 is a small parameter .",
    "define , with @xmath48 , @xmath49 we have @xmath50 and therefore @xmath51 is a bijective map .",
    "this map is a sort of `` change of variables '' decoupling the slow part from the fast part of the dynamics .",
    "note that , in the slow part , @xmath52 , we have somehow removed the fast dynamics associated to the optical state @xmath6 .",
    "indeed , this change of variable leads to a standard form : @xmath53+[h,\\rho]p - p[h,\\rho]p ) , \\label{eq : tikhfast}\\\\ & \\imath\\hbar\\frac{d}{dt}\\rho_s=(1-p)[h,\\rho](1-p)\\notag\\\\ & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad+\\frac{1}{\\big(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\overline\\gamma_k\\big)}\\sum_{k=1}^n \\overline\\gamma_k q_k[h,\\rho]q_k^\\dag.\\label{eq : tikhslow}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 only appears in first equation defining @xmath55 .",
