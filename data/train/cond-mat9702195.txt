    "one - dimensional interacting fermion systems , tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquids,@xcite have recently attracted much attention due to their anomalous response to local perturbations .",
    "recent extensive studies @xcite on transport properties of tl liquids with an impurity revealed that repulsively interacting fermions have vanishing transmission probability through a potential barrier in the low - energy limit .",
    "this is because the interaction between fermions strongly enhances the backward scattering at the barrier .",
    "thus , a single defect effectively cuts a tl liquid into two disconnected ones at zero temperature.@xcite this implies that the local density of states ( ldos ) at the defect is reduced for low energy , and according to kane and fisher@xcite it shows a power - law energy dependence , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a parameter characterizing the tl liquid .",
    "this picture was , however , questioned recently by oreg and finkelstein,@xcite who claimed based on a mapping to a coulomb gas problem that the ldos at the defect is enhanced , rather than suppressed , in the low - energy limit for weakly interacting fermions .",
    "this controversy motivates us to reexamine this issue .",
    "the orthogonality catastrophe@xcite in a tl liquid is another interesting subject which has been discussed by several authors.@xcite they showed that the overlap between the ground state of a pure tl liquid @xmath3 and that of a tl liquid with a single scatterer @xmath4 vanishes in the limit of large system size : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the length of the system .",
    "the exponent @xmath7 is due to the forward - scattering potential and depends on its strength.@xcite it can be calculated directly using a unitary transformation .",
    "the other exponent @xmath8 due to the backward scattering is believed to be independent of the strength of the potential and take a universal value , @xmath9.@xcite in refs .  , and the exponent @xmath8 is calculated by assuming that a backward scattering center can be replaced with an impenetrable potential barrier .",
    "oreg and finkelstein,@xcite however , questioned the validity of the assumption and argued that the exponent of the fermi - edge singularity due to a backward scattering center is zero , which implies @xmath10 . on the other hand , kane _",
    "et al._@xcite used a renormalization - group equation which becomes exact in the limit of weak repulsive interaction between fermions .",
    "they could describe a crossover from the high - energy regime to the low - energy regime , and obtained the same exponent @xmath11 in the low - energy limit .",
    "the result of a recent direct numerical calculation of the overlap integral@xcite is also consistent with @xmath11 .",
    "it is known that , when the tl - liquid parameter @xmath2 is 1/2 , the bosonized hamiltonian containing a nonlinear term representing the backward scattering can be transformed to a quadratic hamiltonian of fermions.@xcite this is essentially the same technique as the emery - kivelson solution of the two - channel kondo problem.@xcite the exact results on the conductance@xcite and non - equilibrium noise spectra@xcite were obtained using this refermionization technique .",
    "it is thus natural to expect that exact calculation should also be possible for the above - mentioned problems .",

    "<S> the orthogonality catastrophe in a tomonaga - luttinger liquid with an impurity is reexamined for the case when the interaction parameter or the dimensionless conductance is @xmath0 . by transforming bosons back to fermions , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is reduced to a quadratic form , which allows for explicit calculation of the overlap integral and the local density of states at the defect site . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent of the orthogonality catastrophe due to a backward scattering center is found to be 1/8 , in agreement with previous studies using different approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependence of the core - hole green s function is computed numerically , which shows a clear crossover from a non - universal short - time behavior to a universal long - time behavior . </S>",
    "<S> the local density of states vanishes linearly in the low - energy limit at @xmath0 .    2 </S>"
