    "recently , a large number of applied problems have been formulated on fractional differential equations and consequently considerable attention has been given to the solutions of those equations .",
    "fractional space derivatives are used to model anomalous diffusion or dispersion , a phenomenon observed in many problems .",
    "there are some diffusion processes for which the fick s second law fails to describe the related transport behavior .",
    "this phenomenon is called anomalous diffusion , which is characterized by the nonlinear growth of the mean square displacement , of a diffusion particle over time .",
    "the anomalous diffusions differ according to the values of @xmath0 , where @xmath0 is the order of the fractional derivative .",
    "some works providing an introduction to fractional calculus related to diffusion problems are , for instance , @xcite . in this work",
    "we will be interested in the anomalous diffusion , called supperdiffusion , for @xmath1 and experimental evidence of this type of diffusion is already reported in several works @xcite .",
    "fractional derivatives are non - local opposed to the local behaviour of integer derivatives .",
    "therefore , different challenges appear when we try to derive numerical methods for this type of equations .",
    "numerical approaches to different types of fractional diffusion models are increasingly appearing in literature .",
    "we can found recent work on numerical solutions for the fractional diffusion equation describing superdiffusion @xcite and also for several transport equations including this type of diffusion @xcite .",
    "some other works consider subdiffusion , which is represented by a time fractional derivative of positive order and less than one @xcite .",
    "however , the challenges for these equations are different from the ones that arise when we consider a space fractional derivative of order @xmath2 .    numerical methods , for models with superdiffusion ,",
    "have been obtained with mathematical techniques which do not necessarily consider a second order discretization for the fractional derivative to achieve second order accuracy . in this work ,",
    "we present a second order approximation for the fractional riemann - liouville derivative of order @xmath0 , @xmath3 .",
    "this approach uses some of the tools described in @xcite and also applied in @xcite to derive an approximation for the caputo fractional derivative defined in bounded domains . here",

    "there are very complete works about the fractional calculus @xcite , where the theoretical properties of this type of derivative are studied in detail .",
    "another way to represent the fractional derivative is by the grnwald - letnikov formula , that is , @xmath21 } ( -1)^k \\left(\\begin{array}{c } \\alpha \\\\ k \\end{array } \\right)u(x - k\\delta x , t ) . \\quad",
