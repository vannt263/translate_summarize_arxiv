    "the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions  @xcite offers a unique chance to explore the properties of hot and dense elementary matter . throughout his scientific life ,",
    "klaus kinder - geiger has given new , creative and stimulating impulses to this exciting field of physics  @xcite .",
    "in the last years of his life , he had focused his attention on the very early phase of such collisions , when most of the energy is transfered to partonic degrees of freedom .",
    "his parton cascade description @xcite for the early stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions has become very important for our understanding of the experimental results gathered at the sps at cern @xcite .",
    "it will be crucial to the interpretation of data which will be collected at the star detector at rhic @xcite .",
    "rhic will begin operation in 1999 with four detectors : two medium scale ones , brahms and phobos , as well as two large scale detectors , phenix and star .",
    "the main emphasis of the star ( solenoidal tracker at rhic ) detector will be the correlation of many ( predominantly hadronic ) observables on an event - by - event basis",
    ".    the great energy range and beam target range accessible with rhic will allow a dedicated systematic search for the quark - gluon phase matter at energy densities an order of magnitude above the transition domain .",
    "this occurs not only because the rapidity density of hadrons is expected to be 24 times larger than in central sps collision , but also because pqcd dominated mini - jet initial conditions are finally reached in the collider ( @xmath1 agev ) energy range .",
    "a whole class of new signatures involving hard pqcd probes ( high @xmath2 and jets ) becomes available .    at yet higher energies at lhc , quark - gluon plasma research efforts and planning",
    "are centered around the alice detector .",
    "its design is similar to that of star .",
    "alice will be the only large scale heavy ion detector setup at lhc . at @xmath3 atev",
    "even bottom quarkonia are copiously produced and transverse momenta twice as high ( @xmath4 gev / c ) will be readily measurable to probe even deeper into the multiparticle dynamics of a qgp .",
    "in the last few years researchers at brookhaven and cern have succeeded to measure a wide spectrum of observables with heavy ion beams , @xmath5 and @xmath6 . while these programs continue to measure with greater precision the beam energy , nuclear size , and centrality dependence of those observables , it is important to recognize the major milestones for relativistic heavy ion physics passed thus far in that work .",
    "the experiments have conclusively demonstrated the existence of strong nuclear @xmath7 dependence of , among others , @xmath8 and @xmath9 meson production and suppression , strangeness enhancement , hadronic resonance production , stopping and directed collective transverse and longitudinal flow of baryons and mesons  in and out of the impact plane , both at ags and sps energies  , and dilepton - enhancement below and above the @xmath10 meson mass .",
    "these observations support that a novel form of `` resonance matter '' at high energy- and baryon density has been created in nuclear collisions .",
    "the global multiplicity and transverse energy measurements prove that substantially more entropy is produced in @xmath11 collisions at the sps than simple superposition of @xmath12 would imply .",
    "multiple initial and final state interactions play a critical role in all observables .",
    "the high midrapidity baryon density ( stopping ) and the observed collective transverse and directed flow patterns constitute one of the strongest evidence for the existence of an extended period ( @xmath13  fm / c ) of high pressure and strong final state interactions .",
    "the enhanced @xmath9 suppression in @xmath14 relative to @xmath15 also attests to this fact .",
    "the anomalous low mass dilepton enhancement shows that substantial in - medium modifications of multiple collision dynamics exists , probably related to in - medium collisional broadening of vector mesons .",
    "the non - saturation of the strangeness ( and anti - strangeness ) production shows that novel non - equilibrium production processes arise in these reactions .",
    "finally , the centrality dependence of @xmath8 absorption in @xmath6 collisions presents further hints towards the nonequilibrium nature of such reactions .",
    "is there evidence for the long sought - after quark - gluon plasma that thus far has only existed as a binary array of predictions inside teraflop computers ?    as we will discuss , it is too early to tell .",
    "theoretically there are still too many `` scenarios '' and idealizations to provide a satisfactory answer .",
    "recent results from microscopic transport models as well as macroscopic hydrodynamical calculations differ significantly from predictions of simple thermal models , e.  g.  in the flow pattern .",
    "still , these nonequilibrium models provide reasonable predictions for the experimental data .",
    "we may therefore be forced to rethink our concept of what constitutes the deconfined phase in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "most probably it is not a blob of thermalized quarks and gluons .",
    "hence , a quark - gluon plasma can only be the source of _ differences _ to the predictions of these models for hadron ratios , the @xmath0 meson production , dilepton yields , or the excitation function of transverse flow .",
    "and there are experimental gaps such as the lack of intermediate mass @xmath16 data and the limited number of beam energies studied thus far , in particular between the ags and sps .    in the future ,",
    "the field is at the doorstep of the next milestone : @xmath11 at @xmath17 agev are due to begin at rhic / bnl in the summer of 1999 , and at even higher energies ( @xmath18 atev ) at lhc / cern in the next millennium .    here",
    ", the results of klaus kinder - geiger are of great importance for an understanding of the data to come : any theoretical description of the early stages of events observed with these machines , reaching extremely high energy and matter densities , must take care of the partonic degrees of freedom ( see @xcite , and fig .",
    "[ pcm ] ) .",
    "one way of doing this is the use of parton cascade models , as initiated and furthered by klaus .",
    "in the present survey of relativistic heavy ion collisions , we employ two sharply distinct nonequilibrium models , namely the macroscopic 3-fluid hydrodynamical model @xcite and the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamical model , urqmd @xcite .",
    "the first model assumes that a projectile- and a target fluid interpenetrate upon impact of the two nuclei , creating a third fluid ( in the present version baryon free , see , however , @xcite ) via new source terms in the continuity equations for energy- and momentum flux .",
    "those source terms are taken from energy- and rapidity loss measurements in high energy @xmath19-collisions .",
    "the equation of state ( eos ) of this model assumes equilibrium only in each fluid separately and allows for a first order phase transition to a quark gluon plasma in fluid 1 , 2 or 3 , if the energy density in the fluid under consideration exceeds the critical value for two phase coexistence .",
    "pure qgp can also be formed in every fluid separately , if the energy density in that fluid exceeds the maximum energy density for the mixed phase .",
    "the urqmd model , on the other hand , assumes an independent evolution of hadrons , strings , and constituent quarks and diquarks in a nonequilibrium multiparticle system .",
    "the collision terms in this system of coupled boltzmann ( partial differential-/integral- ) equations are taken from experimental data , where available , and otherwise from additive quark model and string phenomenology .    what is the role of partonic degrees of freedom in relativistic heavy ion reactions at the sps ?",
    "[ pcm ] shows the time evolution of the energy density @xmath20 in central @xmath6 reactions at 160 agev as obtained within _",
    "a ) _ the parton cascade approach vni @xcite of klaus kinder - geiger , _",
    "b ) _ the urqmd model @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that in both models and at early times of the collision , a large fraction of the energy density is contained in partonic degrees of freedom ( vni ) or to nearly equal parts in constituent diquarks and quarks from the strings and in virtual hadrons .",
    "this ( virtual ) `` partonic '' phase in @xmath6 reactions at 160 agev is , however , not to be identified with an equilibrated qgp .",
    "note that the absolute values differ by a factor 2 in the two models and depend heavily on the rapidity cuts imposed to discriminate between virtual free streaming and interacting matter .",
    "while there is currently a strong debate whether ( equilibrated ) deconfined matter may have been produced at the cern / sps , it is widely expected that in collisions of heavy nuclei at rhic a qgp will be formed .",
    "the consequence is that at rhic , both , partonic and hadronic , degrees of freedom have to be treated explicitly .",
    "a large step in that direction has been recently undertaken by modeling the initial parton dynamics in the framework of the parton cascade model , performing hadronization via a cluster hadronization model and configuration space coalescence , and finally describing the hadronic phase either by a hadronic after - burner @xcite or by a full microscopic hadronic transport approach @xcite .",
    "technically the latter approach is realized by combining vni @xcite for the initial phase and hadronization with urqmd @xcite for the later , hadronic , reaction stages .",
    "the resulting reaction dynamics indicates a strong influence of hadronic rescattering on the space - time pattern of hadronic freeze - out and on the shape of transverse mass spectra .",
    "the upper frame of figure  [ tevol ] shows the time evolution ( in c.m .",
    "time , @xmath21 ) of the rapidity density dn / dy of partons ( i.e. quarks and gluons ) and on - shell hadron multiplicities at @xmath22 .",
    "note that there are no distinctly separate time scales for the three reactions stages discussed earlier in this article : hadronic and partonic phases may evolve in parallel and both , parton - parton as well as hadron - hadron interactions occur in the same space - time volume .",
    "the overlap between the partonic and hadronic stages of the reaction stretches from @xmath23  fm / c up to @xmath24  fm / c for the midrapidity region .",
    "the calculation indicates that this overlap occurs not only in time but also in coordinate space ",
    "partonic and hadronic degrees of freedom occupy the same space - time volume during this reaction phase @xcite .",
    "hadronic resonances like the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 ( which are the most abundantly produced baryonic and mesonic resonance states ) are formed and remain populated up to @xmath27  fm / c , indicating a considerable amount of hadronic rescattering .",
    "hadron yields saturate at time - scales @xmath28  fm / c .",
    "since resonance decays have not been factored into this estimate of the saturation time , this number should be viewed as an upper estimate for the time of chemical freeze - out .",
    "rates for hadron - hadron collisions per unit rapidity at @xmath29 are shown in the lower frame of figure  [ tevol ] , i.e. all hadron - hadron collisions for hadrons with @xmath30 were taken into account .",
    "meson - meson and meson - baryon interactions dominate the dynamics of the hadronic phase .",
    "due to their larger cross sections baryon - antibaryon collisions occur more frequently than baryon - baryon interactions .",
    "however , both are suppressed as compared to meson - meson and meson - baryon interactions .",
    "this is due to the large meson multiplicity , which creates a `` mesonic medium '' in which the baryons propagate .",
    "a comparison of calculations with and without hadronic rescattering shows that e.g. the proton and antiproton multiplicities change by a factor of two due to hadronic rescattering , whereas the ratio of their yields remains roughly constant .",
    "evidently chemical freeze - out of the system occurs well into the hadronic phase and not at the `` phase - boundary '' .",
    "the collision rates indicate that interactions cease at @xmath31  fm / c at which point the system can be regarded as kinetically frozen out .",
    "since the saturation of the hadron yields occurs earlier , there is a clear separation between chemical and kinetic freeze - out .",
    "let us now discuss the results obtained from hadronic probes , such as observed production of @xmath0 mesons , enhancement of strange baryons , light mesons , and particle ratios . observed hadrons include feeding by the decay of resonances .",
    ".[meanb ] the average square of the transverse distances of the charmonium states and the total quarkonium - nucleon cross sections @xmath32 . for the @xmath33 two values arise , due to the spin dependent wave functions ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "@xmath35 are the perturbative qcd contribution at different energies . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "debye screening of heavy charmonium mesons in an equilibrated quark - gluon plasma may reduce the range of the attractive force between heavy quarks and antiquarks @xcite .",
    "mott transitions then dissolve particular bound states , one by one .",
    "na38 found evidence of charmonium suppression in light ion reactions .",
    "then also in @xmath15 such suppression was observed .",
    "new preliminary @xmath6 data of na50 show `` anomalous '' suppression .",
    "one of the main problems in the interpretation of the observed suppression as a signal for deconfinement is that non - equilibrium dynamical sources of charmonium suppression have also been clearly discovered in @xmath15 reactions , where the formation of an equilibrated quark - gluon plasma is not expected .",
    "a recent development is the calculation of the hard contributions to the charmonium- and bottonium - nucleon cross sections based on the qcd factorization theorem and the non - relativistic quarkonium model @xcite . including non - perturbative contributions",
    ", the calculated @xmath15 cross section agrees well with the data .    the numerical calculation shown in tab .",
    "[ meanb ] was done for charmonium states produced in midrapidity at sps energy and in the target fragmentation region at rhic and lhc .",
    "one can see that the hard contribution to the cross section is just a correction at sps energies , but at rhic energies both contributions become comparable and at lhc it dominates ( one neglects here that the dglap equation ( dokshitser - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) should be probably violated  @xcite ) .    whereas these descriptions of nuclear absorption can account for the @xmath15 observation , the corrections needed for an extrapolation to @xmath11 reactions are , however , not yet under theoretical control .",
    "purely hadronic dissociation scenarios have been suggested @xcite which could account for @xmath8 and @xmath9 suppression without invoking the concept of deconfinement ( `` comover models '' ) .",
    "suppression in excess to that due to preformation and nuclear absorption is ascribed in such models to interactions of the charmonium mesons with `` comoving '' , but probably off - equilibrium , mesons and baryons , which are produced copiously in nuclear collisions .",
    "[ jpsi_dyet ] shows an urqmd calculation which employs a microscopic free streaming simulation for @xmath8 production and a microscopic transport calculation for nuclear and comover dynamics as well as for rescattering @xcite .",
    "the dissociation cross sections are calculated using the qcd factorization theorem @xcite , feeding from @xmath9 and @xmath33 states is taken into account , and the @xmath36 dissociation cross sections increase linearly with time during the formation of the charmonium state . taking into account the non - equilibrium `` comovers '' ( @xmath37 ) ,",
    "the agreement between theory and data is reasonable ( fig .",
    "[ jpsi_dyet ] ) . new , unpublished data agree better with the model predictions , but the high and low @xmath38 regions remain to be studied carefully in the experiment . at present",
    ", no ab initio calculation does predict sudden changes in the suppression .",
    "in fact , from three - fluid calculations , even with qgp phase included , only a moderate change of the average and local energy density with bombarding energy is predicted .",
    "this seems to strongly speak against drastic threshold effects in the charmonium production .",
    "the strong dependence of these results on details , such as the treatment of the formation time or the time dependent dissociation cross section , remain to be studied further .",
    "furthermore , quantum effects such as energy dependent formation and coherence lengths must be taken into account @xcite before definite statements can be made with regard to the nature of the @xmath8 suppression .",
    "interpretations of the data based on plasma scenarios are also increasingly evolving away from the original mott transition analog @xcite .",
    "hence , the theoretical debate on the interpretation of the pattern of charmonium suppression discovered by na38/na50 at the sps is far from settled .",
    "it is not clear whether the suppression is the smoking gun of nonequilibrium dynamics or deconfinement .",
    "it is not likely to be due to simple debye screening .",
    "the major goal of further theoretical work is not to continue to try to rule out more `` conventional '' explanations , but to give positive proof of additional suppression by qcd - calculations which actually _ predict _ the @xmath38-dependence of the conjectured signature .",
    "consistency tests and a detailed simultaneous analysis of all other measured observables are needed , if at least the same standards as for the present calculations are to be hold up .      the study of particle ratios has recently attended great interest at the ags @xcite and at the sps @xcite .",
    "one assumes a thermalized system with a constant density @xmath39 ( box profile ) , a constant temperature @xmath40 and a linear radial and longitudinal flow velocity profile @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "these parameters are assumed to be the same for all hadrons / fragments . at some time @xmath43 and density @xmath44 ,",
    "the system decouples as a whole ( a horizontal freeze - out in the @xmath45-plane ) and the particles are emitted instantaneously from the whole volume of the thermal source . a complete loss of memory results , due to thermalization ",
    "the emitted particles carry no information about the evolution of the source . if one wants to use the inverse slope parameter  @xmath46 as thermometer @xcite , the feeding from @xmath47 s etc .",
    ", as well as the radial flow need to be incorporated into the analysis .",
    "the same holds for the use of d / p , @xmath48/p etc . as an entropymeter@xcite .",
    "in addition , the proper hagedorn volume correction can be applied @xcite .",
    "a two parameter fit ( @xmath49 , t , @xmath50 is fixed by strangeness conservation ) to the hadronic freeze - out data describes the experimental results well , if feeding is included @xcite .",
    "does this compatibility with a thermal source proof volume emission from a globally equilibrated source ?",
    "the ideal gas thermal fit to experimental data for hadron ratios in @xmath51 collisions at 200 agev gives values for the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath52 which can be used as input for a @xmath53 chiral mean - field model @xcite extended to finite temperatures @xcite .",
    "feeding from the decay of higher resonances is included .",
    "one finds that in such a model ( which selfconsistently contains a chiral phase transition at @xmath54 mev ) the ideal gas model values @xmath55 mev and @xmath56  mev lead to strong deviations from the experimental data . only the @xmath57-ratio is in a good agreement , in contrast to the ideal gas model .",
    "hence , the system can not be close to the chiral phase transition  the @xmath46 and @xmath58 values extracted from the free thermal model can not be identified with the real temperature and chemical potential of the system !",
    "the chiral mean - field model does reproduce the data compiled in @xcite for relative abundances in @xmath6 collisions at 160 agev ( fig .",
    "[ ratios_urqmd_chiral ] , left ) for @xmath59 mev and @xmath60 , much lower than the thermal model results @xcite ( @xmath61  mev , @xmath62 mev ) .",
    "the microscopic urqmd transport model is in good agreement with the measured hadron ratios of the system @xmath51 at cern / sps @xcite .",
    "a thermal model fit to the calculated ratios yields a temperature of @xmath63 mev and a chemical potential of @xmath64  mev .",
    "however , these ratios exhibit a strong rapidity dependence",
    ". thus , thermal model fits to data may be distorted due to different acceptances for the individual ratios .",
    "hadron ratios for the system @xmath6 are predicted by urqmd and can be fitted by a thermal model with @xmath65  mev and @xmath66  mev ( fig .",
    "[ ratios_urqmd_chiral ] , right ) . analyzing the results of non - equilibrium transport model calculations by an equilibrium model may , however , be not meaningful .",
    "there is a problem in the definition of equilibrium in itself : do heavy ion collisions ever reach a thermalized system ? or are there transient steady states off equilibrium @xcite ? due to the rapid dynamics of the system ,",
    "the assumption of detailed balance is not fulfilled in the initial stage .",
    "this drives the system into a steady state far from equilibrium , but stationary in time .",
    "this steady state is easily visible in an enhanced production of light mesons , as compared to thermal models .    during the initial off - equilibrium stage of energetic nuclear collisions , a large amount of entropy",
    "can be produced @xcite .",
    "the subsequent expansion is , on the other hand , often assumed to be nearly isentropic .",
    "the entropy produced during the compression stage is closely linked to the finally observable relative particle yields .",
    "this entropy production can be calculated @xcite within three - fluid hydrodynamics .",
    "the entropy per net participating baryon , @xmath67 , saturates rapidly as a function of cm - time and is essentially time independent for later times when the freeze - out is reached .",
    "the chemical composition of the fireball is given by the net baryon density , the net ( zero ) strangeness of the system , and the specific entropy @xmath67 , as described for the thermal model above .",
    "the hadron ratios thus obtained are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ratiosws ] . at ags and sps energies , they are quite close to the data @xcite .",
    "for such a simple estimate of hadron production in nuclear collisions , deviations from the experimental ratios by up to factors of two have to be expected .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig_ratiosws ] that the simultaneous measurement of various hadron ratios , like @xmath68 , d@xmath69 and , in particular , @xmath70 ( provided antibaryons also reach chemical equilibrium ) allows to determine the produced entropy in the energy range between the ags and the sps .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath71-ratio is practically constant .",
    "the total specific entropy @xmath67 produced within the three - fluid model is consistent with the @xmath67 values extracted from data using relative particle yields from the thermal model .",
    "one finds @xmath72 for ags and @xmath73 for sps energies .",
    "the excitation function of the specific entropy @xmath74 does not exhibit any threshold signatures of the phase transition to the qgp incorporated in the eos .",
    "this is due to the gradual transition through the wide coexistence region in the energy density between @xmath75  10100  agev .",
    "let us now turn to multi - strange signals . in nucleon nucleon collisions ,",
    "the production of particles containing strange quarks is strongly suppressed as compared to the production of particles with @xmath76 and @xmath77 quarks due to the higher mass of the @xmath78 quark pair .",
    "it has been speculated that the yield of strange and multi - strange mesons , ( anti- ) baryons and anti - hyperons ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 ) should be enhanced in the presence of a qgp .",
    "the study of ( multi)strange hyperons by the wa97 @xcite and the na49 collaborations show an enhancement of strangeness production for central collisions when studying the centrality dependence of various strange particle yields ( @xmath81 ) in @xmath6 collisions at 158 agev as compared to @xmath82 collisions at 158 agev .",

    "simple energy densities estimated from rapidity distributions and temperatures extracted from particle spectra indicate that initial conditions could be near or just above the domain of deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "still the quest for an _ unambiguous _ signature remains open .",
    "directed flow has been discovered  now a flow excitation function , filling the gap between 10 agev ( ags ) and 160 agev ( sps ) , would be extremely interesting to look for the softening of the qcd equation of state in the coexistence region .",
    "the investigation of the physics of high baryon density ( e.g. partial restoration of chiral symmetry via properties of vector mesons ) is presently not accessible due to the lack of dedicated accelerators in the @xmath101 agev regime .",
    "however , dedicated accelerators would be mandatory to explore these intriguing effects in the excitation function .",
    "it is questionable whether this key program will actually get support at cern .",
    "also the excitation function of particle yield ratios ( @xmath102 ) and , in particular , multistrange ( anti-)hyperon yields , can be a sensitive probe of physics changes in the eos .",
    "the search for novel , unexpected forms of @xmath53 matter , e.g. _ hypermatter _ , _ strangelets _ or even _ charmlets _ is intriguing .",
    "such exotic qcd multi - meson and multi - baryon configurations would extend the present periodic table of elements into hitherto unexplored dimensions .",
    "a strong experimental effort should continue in that direction .    for applications to nuclear collision observables , an extension of the qgp concept to non - equilibrium conditions is required .",
    "the popular use of simple fireball models may provide convenient parameterizations of large bodies of data , but they will never provide a convincing proof of new physics .",
    "microscopic transport models are required that can address simultaneously all the observables and account for experimental acceptance and trigger configurations .",
    "present work in parton cascade dynamics is based largely on analogy to transport phenomena in known abelian qed plasmas .",
    "a significant new feature of qcd plasmas is its ultrarelativistic nature and the dominance of ( gluon ) radiative transport .",
    "these greatly complicate the equations .",
    "the role of quantum coherence phenomena beyond classical transport theories has only recently been established within idealized models .",
    "much further work will be required in this connection .",
    "the outstanding theoretical task will be the development of practical ( vs. formal ) tools to compute quantum non - equilibrium multiple collision dynamics in qcd .",
    "experiments and data on ultra - relativistic collisions are essential in order to motivate , guide , and constrain theoretical developments .",
    "they provide the only terrestrial probes of non - perturbative aspects of qcd and its dynamical vacuum .",
    "the understanding of confinement and chiral symmetry remains one of the key questions at the beginning of the next millennium .",
