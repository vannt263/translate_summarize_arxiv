    "self - regulated feedback from accreting supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in gaseous protogalaxies is thought to play a key role in establishing the @xmath0@xmath1 relation observed in local quiescent galaxies , between smbh mass and bulge - star velocity dispersion : @xmath5 with @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the accreting smbh drives a wind , which sweeps the surrounding ambient medium into a shell .",
    "there is then a critical smbh mass above which the wind thrust pushing the shell outwards ( proportional to @xmath0 ) can overcome the inward gravitational pull of the dark matter ( related to @xmath1 ) and the smbh itself . at this critical mass ,",
    "the shell may be blown out of the galaxy , cutting off fuel to the smbh and locking in an @xmath0@xmath1 relation @xcite . supporting this scenario",
    "are observations of strong outflows in local active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , both on large scales ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and closer to the smbhs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter in particular have speeds and mechanical luminosities similar to those needed for smbh winds to have cleared the gas from now - normal spheroids at high redshift , when the systems were active .",
    "the dynamics of a swept - up shell of gas depend on whether or not the region of shocked wind material immediately behind the shell is able to cool .",
    "if the shocked gas cools efficiently then the region is geometrically thin and the swept - up shell is pushed outwards by the ram pressure of the wind .",
    "this momentum - driven regime is expected to be the case initially in the case of smbh feedback @xcite , and thus many authors have considered the @xmath0@xmath1 relation that results if the feedback is entirely momentum - driven ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in @xcite we considered shells moving outwards in non - isothermal , spherical dark matter haloes that have peaked circular speed curves .",
    "we showed that the critical smbh mass above which any shell can escape tends to the limiting value ( for haloes much more massive than the smbh , independent of any further details of the dark matter density profile ) @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the peak value of the circular speed in the dark matter halo ; @xmath9 is the electron scattering opacity ; and @xmath10 is a spatially constant gas - to - dark matter mass fraction .",
    "the peak circular speed defines a natural `` characteristic '' velocity dispersion for a non - isothermal galaxy : @xmath11 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : msig ] ) then implies an @xmath0@xmath1 relation , which has a slope and an intercept that are near the observed values ( see figure 2 below ) .",
    "if the shocked gas can not cool then the region behind the shell is geometrically thick and hot .",
    "the outflow is energy - driven and the shell is pushed outwards by the thermal pressure of the shocked material . in the context of smbh feedback , an initially momentum - driven shell is expected to transition to energy - driven , probably quite early on when the shell is still at relatively small galactocentric radius (  [ sec : edriven ] below ; cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , in this paper we investigate the implications of _ purely _ energy - driven feedback for the @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "in  [ sec : edriven ] we derive the large - radius coasting speed , @xmath12 , of an energy - conserving shell in a dark - matter halo modelled as a singular isothermal sphere with velocity dispersion @xmath13 .",
    "we find that for the shell to coast at the escape speed of a truncated isothermal halo ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) requires @xmath15 where @xmath0 is the ( fixed ) smbh mass driving a wind of speed @xmath16 .",
    "this @xmath0@xmath1 relation differs from that resulting from momentum - driven outflows ( equation [ [ eq : msig ] ] ) , both in the power on @xmath13 and in the explicit dependence on @xmath3 .    in  [ sec :",
    "gultekin ] we apply our escape condition for energy - conserving feedback to the @xmath0@xmath1 relation defined observationally by a standard sample of low - redshift , quiescent early - type galaxies and bulges @xcite .",
    "we use equation ( [ eq : intro_result ] ) to infer the black hole wind speeds that would have had to occur during the main epoch of galaxy and smbh formation , if this simple model is to account for the individual @xmath0 and @xmath1 values for each galaxy or bulge in the @xcite sample .",
    "this gives a distribution of @xmath17 for these galaxies in the past . in ",
    "[ sec : vwindc_dist ] we compare this distribution directly to the distributions of @xmath17 observed for fast outflows in different samples of local agn @xcite .",
    "our main result is a remarkable similarity between these distributions . in particular ,",
    "the median smbh wind speed we infer for the normal galaxies of @xcite is @xmath18 , while the median of the outflow speeds in low - redshift agn is @xmath19 according to @xcite or @xmath20 according to @xcite",
    "in the self - regulated feedback scenario the black hole wind sweeps up a shell of ambient gas as it moves outwards .",
    "this gives rise to two shock fronts , one propagating forwards into the ambient medium and one propagating back into the wind material .",
    "the resulting shock pattern has a four - zone structure : 1 ) the freely flowing wind ; 2 ) the shocked wind region lying between the wind shock and the contact surface that separates material originally in the wind from material originating in the ambient medium ; 3 ) the shocked ambient medium , lying between the contact surface and the ambient shock , also containing the original swept - up shell that gave rise to the shock fronts ; and 4 ) the undisturbed ambient medium .    in detail , the dynamics of the swept - up shell depend on three timescales : the flow time of the shell , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the radius of the shell and @xmath23 is the shell velocity ; the dynamical time of the wind , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the radius of the wind shock and @xmath3 is the wind velocity ; and the cooling time of the shocked wind , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "if @xmath27 , then the shocked wind region cools before more energy is injected into the region from the freely flowing wind .",
    "the material in the region is then confined to a thin shell ( so @xmath28 ) and the shell is effectively driven outwards by a transfer of momentum from the wind impacting on its inner side , corresponding to a momentum - driven outflow .    if , instead , @xmath29 , then the most recently shocked material can not cool in the time it takes to travel across the shocked wind region .",
    "the region is thick and hot and drives the shell outwards with its thermal pressure , corresponding to an energy - driven outflow .    in the intermediate case ,",
    "@xmath30 , the shell is in a partially radiative phase where most of the material cools and condenses into a thin shell but the most recently shocked material has not cooled and occupies most of the volume of the region . in this regime the outflow conserves neither energy nor momentum .    for a wind from an smbh , with cooling primarily by inverse compton scattering @xcite ,",
    "the cooling rate is ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the velocity of a post - shock electron ; @xmath33 is the post - shock electron energy ; @xmath34 is the radiation energy density ; and @xmath9 is the electron - scattering opacity .",
    "we take @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the eddington luminosity of a black hole of mass @xmath0 , and @xmath37 for the electron energy .",
    "then , the cooling time , @xmath38 , is less than the dynamical time of the wind , @xmath39 , at radii @xmath40 when the wind shock is inside this radius , the shocked wind region is thin , so @xmath28 and the shell is momentum - driven .",
    "the cooling time exceeds the flow time of the shell , @xmath41 , at radii @xmath42 for typical shell velocities @xmath43 .",
    "this is in rough agreement with @xcite ( @xcite ; see their equation [ 6 ] ) , although they replace @xmath44 with an estimate for the terminal velocity of a momentum - driven shell and normalize to a higher fiducial @xmath3 than we do ( see sections [ sec : gultekin ] and [ sec : vwindc_dist ] below for more about typical wind speeds ) .",
    "in any case , the radius in equation ( [ eq : r_edriven ] ) is comparable to the sphere of influence of a @xmath45 black hole in a stellar distribution with velocity dispersion @xmath46 . as such",
    ", smbh outflows can be energy - conserving over much of their evolution , and accordingly we focus on _ purely _ energy - driven feedback in what follows .",
    "@xcite noted that a self - regulated feedback scenario can also be applied to nuclear star clusters in galaxy centres to explain the @xmath47@xmath1 relation observed by @xcite . in that case , cooling by atomic processes gives a shorter cooling timescale with a strong dependence on the wind speed ( equation [ 9 ] of @xcite ) , and a slower wind speed results in a longer dynamical time .",
    "thus , outflows from nuclear clusters can cool efficiently and be momentum - driven to much larger radii than in the black hole case .    whether momentum- or energy - driven , the equation of motion for a shell of swept - up gas moving out into the dark - matter halo of a protogalaxy against the inwards gravitational pull of both the smbh and the dark matter behind the shell",

    "by contrast , the solid line running through the data in figure [ fig : msigma ] is the smbh mass required for energy - driven shells to escape singular isothermal spheres , from equation ( [ eq : sis_result ] ) with a fixed smbh wind speed of @xmath127 ( and assuming a wind optical depth @xmath110 and a gas - to - dark matter mass fraction @xmath128 ) . with @xmath17 set to a constant to draw this line",

    "it is not clear how selection effects , observational biases or limitations due to instrumentation may have either affected the measurement of relatively slow outflows , or perhaps even prevented their inclusion in studies designed to focus on `` ultra - fast '' systems .",
    "it is also worth noting that the probability that the @xmath17 measurements of @xcite and @xcite are drawn from the same parent distribution is a formally inconclusive @xmath156 the same as in the comparison between the @xcite distribution of @xmath3 for their agn and ours for the normal galaxies . as such",
    ", it is not clear that any of the data suffice yet to allow a robust comparison at a very detailed level between distributions of observed smbh wind speeds and those inferred from any model .",
    "this makes it even more noteworthy that the median of the @xmath3 distribution we have obtained in this paper lies within a factor @xmath1573 of the median @xmath3 of two different observed distributions .",
    "ultimately , our results are encouraging for the general idea that there is a parallel between the strong nuclear outflows found in local agn and the kind of black hole feedback that is routinely assumed to have been a key part of galaxy formation and the establishment of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation .",
    "they also lend support to the relevance of energy - driven feedback specifically , and to the simple sort of modelling that we have applied to assess its role quantitatively .",
    "we have looked at the behaviour of energy - conserving supershells of swept - up ambient gas driven into isothermal protogalaxies by black hole winds . at large radii ,",
    "such shells tend to a constant coasting speed , @xmath12 , that depends on the black hole mass , @xmath0 , the black hole wind speed , @xmath3 , and the velocity dispersion of the halo , @xmath13 . for a shell to coast at the escape speed of a truncated isothermal halo ( i.e. , @xmath158 ) requires @xmath159 as in equations ( [ eq : mvwind_gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : sis_result ] ) .",
    "we applied this escape condition for energy - conserving feedback to the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation for the sample of quiescent early - type galaxies and bulges of @xcite .",
    "we used equation ( [ eq : sis_result ] ) to infer the black hole wind speed that each galaxy would have had during an active phase if our simple model is to account for the measured value of @xmath0 in the galaxy , given its observed @xmath1 . in this approach , scatter in the observed @xmath0@xmath1 relation directly reflects a distribution of wind speeds from the smbhs in the protogalaxies .",
    "we compared the distribution of wind velocities we obtained for the normal galaxies in @xcite to the observed distributions of outflow velocities in two different samples of local agn @xcite .",
    "the distributions are strikingly similar .",
    "most notably , the median of our inferred wind velocities , @xmath18 , is within a factor @xmath1573 of the median of the observed distribution of wind speeds of both @xcite ( @xmath19 ) and @xcite ( @xmath160 ) .",
