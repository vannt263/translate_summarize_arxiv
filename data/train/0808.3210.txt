    "let @xmath2 be a variety over a finite field @xmath3 , and let @xmath4 denote the bounded derived category of @xmath0-adic mixed constructible sheaves on @xmath2 . recall that the _ weights _ of an object @xmath5 are certain integers defined in terms of the eigenvalues of the frobenius morphism on the stalks at @xmath6 at @xmath3-points of @xmath2 .",
    "an object is said to be _ pure _ of weight @xmath7 if both it and its verdier dual have weights @xmath8 .",
    "the theory of weights and purity plays a vital role in the proof and in applications of the weil conjectures  @xcite .",
    "two of the most astonishing consequences of the weil conjectures occur in the theory of perverse sheaves , developed in  ( * ? ? ? * chap . 5 ) .",
    "they are ( i )  the purity theorem  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thorme  5.3.5 ) , which states that every perverse sheaf has a canonical filtration with pure subquotients ( and in particular that every simple perverse sheaf is pure ) , and ( ii )  the decomposition theorem  ( * ? ? ?",

    "* thorme i ) ) .",
    "these two theorems are the source of much of the power of the theory of perverse sheaves for applications in representation theory and other areas .    in this paper , we seek analogues of these results in the setting of derived categories of equivariant coherent sheaves .",
    "let @xmath9 be a scheme of finite type over an arbitrary field , and let @xmath10 be an affine algebraic group acting on @xmath9 with finitely many orbits .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the bounded derived category of @xmath10-equivariant coherent sheaves on @xmath9 .",
    "the category of _ staggered sheaves _",
    ", introduced in  @xcite , is the heart of a certain nonstandard @xmath1-structure on @xmath11 .",
    "this category shares some of the key properties of perverse sheaves : for example , every object has finite length , and the simple objects arise via the `` @xmath12 functor '' from irreducible vector bundles on orbits .    in @xmath11",
    "there is no single best notion of weight or purity as there is in the @xmath0-adic setting .",
    "rather , there is a large number of such notions parameterized by _ baric perversities _ , which are certain integer - valued functions on the set of @xmath10-orbits in @xmath9 .",
    "more precisely , in  @xcite we associated to each baric perversity a _ baric structure _ ( a certain kind of filtration of a triangulated category ) on @xmath11 , which we use here to simulate the formalism of weights .",
    "we call an object @xmath13 _ pure _ of baric degree @xmath14 if both it and its serre  grothendieck dual lie in the `` @xmath8 '' part of the baric structure .",
    "( a result of s.  morel  @xcite essentially states that frobenius weights give rise to a baric structure on @xmath4 , so the theory of @xmath0-adic mixed perverse sheaves could be redeveloped using the language of baric structures as well . )",
    "the main results of the present paper ( which are theorems [ thm : purity ] , [ thm : purity2 ] , and [ thm : decomposition ] ) come in two incarnations , a `` baric '' one and a `` skew '' one . in the baric version , they state that under some reasonable hypotheses , every staggered sheaf has a canonical filtration with pure subquotients , and every pure object of @xmath11 is a direct sum of shifts of simple staggered sheaves .",
    "the skew versions consist of essentially the same statements , but with purity replaced by a new concept called _ skew - purity_.    an outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in section  [ sect : prelim ] by fixing notation and recalling relevant results about baric structures and staggered sheaves . in sections  [ sect :",
    "pure ] and  [ sect : purep ] , we construct two @xmath1-structures on the full triangulated subcategory of pure objects of baric degree @xmath14 in @xmath11 , called the _ purified standard @xmath1-structure _ and the _ pure - perverse @xmath1-structure_. ( the latter is defined in terms of the former . ) we also prove that the heart of the pure - perverse @xmath1-structure is contained in that of the staggered @xmath1-structure . in section  [",
    "sect : ic ] , we study simple objects in the pure - perverse @xmath1-structure .",
    "they , like simple staggered sheaves , are characterized by a certain uniqueness property , and this allows us to prove that every simple staggered sheaf lies in the heart of a suitable pure - perverse @xmath1-structure .",
    "this is a major step towards the baric version of the purity theorem , whose proof is completed in section  [ sect : purity ] .",
    "next , in section  [ sect : orbit ] , which is essentially independent of the rest of the paper , we give a combinatorial classification of staggered @xmath1-structures on a variety consisting of a single @xmath10-orbit .",
    "this allows us to give an elementary criterion for a certain @xmath15-vanishing condition that appears as a hypothesis throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "section  [ sect : ext - van ] contains some results on vanishing of higher @xmath16-groups ; these lay the the groundwork for the definition of skew - purity in section  [ sect : skew ] .",
    "the skew version of the purity theorem is proved in section  [ sect : purity2 ] , and both versions of the decomposition theorem are proved together in section  [ sect : decomp ] .",
    "finally , section  [ sect : example ] gives a brief example .",
    "let @xmath9 be a scheme of finite type over a field @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath10 be an affine algebraic group over @xmath17 , acting on @xmath9 .",
    "assume that @xmath10 acts on @xmath9 with finitely many orbits . here , and throughout the paper , an _ orbit _ is a reduced , locally closed @xmath10-invariant subscheme containing no proper nonempty closed @xmath10-invariant subschemes .",

    "only the results of sections  [ sect : pure ] and  [ sect : purep ] hold in such great generality .",
    "the main results do not , and it simplifies the discussion to impose these conditions at the outset .",
    "we uniformly adopt the convention that terms like `` open subscheme , '' `` closed subscheme , '' and `` irreducible '' are always to be interpreted in a @xmath10-invariant sense .",
    "that is , `` open subscheme '' should always be understood to mean `` @xmath10-invariant open subscheme , '' and a subscheme is `` irreducible '' if it is not a union of two proper closed ( @xmath10-invariant ) subschemes",

    "a perversity @xmath66 is said to be _ monotone _ if whenever @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 .",
    "a number of constructions in the sequel depend on the choice of a perversity .",
    "we will often refer to specific kinds of perversities , such as `` baric perversities , '' `` deligne  bezrukavnikov perversities , '' and `` staggered perversities . ''",
    "these are not intrinsically different kinds of objects ; rather , the adjectives serve merely to indicate how a particular perversity will be used ( _ e.g. _ , to construct a baric structure ) .    given a perversity @xmath65 , we define three different kinds of `` dual perversity , '' as follows : @xmath69 a perversity is called _ comonotone _ if its dual is monotone .",
    "this condition is , of course , ambiguous , but the intended type of duality will be clear from context whenever this term is used .    the _ middle perversity _ of a given kind ( baric , deligne ",
