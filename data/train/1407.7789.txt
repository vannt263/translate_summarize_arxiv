    "calculating the thermal properties of materials is important for predicting the thermodynamic stability of structural phases and assessing their importance for a variety of applications .",
    "the lattice thermal conductivity , @xmath0 , is a crucial design parameter in a wide range of important technologies , such us the development of new thermoelectric materials @xcite , heat sink materials for thermal management in electronic devices @xcite , and rewritable density scanning - probe phase - change memories @xcite .",
    "high thermal conductivity materials , which typically have a zincblende or diamond - like structure , are essential in microelectronic and nanoelectronic devices to achieve efficient heat removal @xcite , and have been intensively studied for the past few decades @xcite .",
    "low thermal conductivity materials constitute the basis of a new generation of thermoelectric materials and thermal barrier coatings @xcite .",
    "the determination of the thermal conductivity of materials is computationally demanding since it requires calculation of multiple - phonon scattering processes , that are the origin of the lattice resistance to heat transport .",
    "the methods most commonly used currently to calculate the thermal conductivity are based on solving the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) .",
    "this solution involves the calculation of the phonon frequencies , group velocities , and the harmonic and anharmonic interatomic force constants ( ifcs ) @xcite . in particular , the third - order anharmonic ifcs are required in order to incorporate the effects of three phonon scattering processes @xcite . the standard method to calculate these anharmonic ifcs",
    "is based on density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "deinzer et al .",
    "@xcite used density functional perturbation theory ( dfpt ) to obtain third - order ifcs to study the phonon linewidths . in the last decade , this method has been successfully used to solve the bte and predict the thermal conductivity of different materials @xcite .",
    "such evaluation of the higher - order ifcs requires electronic structure calculations for multiple large supercells , each of which has a different set of atomic displacements .",
    "these first principles solutions of the bte are therefore computationally extremely expensive .",
    "a variety of simple methods have been devised to evaluate the thermal properties of materials at reduced computational cost .",
    "early approximate implementations to compute the lattice thermal conductivity were based on semi - empirical models to solve the bte , in which some parameters are obtained from fitting to experimental data @xcite .",
    "this reduces the predictive power of the calculations .",
    "an alternative approach to calculating thermal conductivity is based on the green - kubo formula , which employs molecular dynamics simulations to calculate thermal currents over long time periods after thermal equilibrium is reached @xcite .",
    "this technique takes into account high order scattering processes , but the usage of semi - empirical potentials leads to errors on the order of 50@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the methods described above are unsuitable for rapid generation and screening of large databases of materials properties in order to identify trends and simple descriptors for thermal properties @xcite . to accomplish this , we chose to implement a much cheaper approach , the `` gibbs '' quasi - harmonic debye model @xcite .",
    "this approach does not require large supercell calculations since it relies merely on first - principles calculations of the energy as a function of unit cell volume .",
    "it is thus much more tractable computationally and is eminently suited to investigating the thermal properties of entire classes of materials in a highly - automated fashion , in order to identify promising candidates for more in - depth experimental and computational analysis .",
    "we incorporate this model in a new software library , the automatic gibbs library ( ) , within the aflow @xcite and materials project @xcite frameworks for high - throughput computational materials science , and use it to construct a database of computed compound thermal conductivities and debye temperatures .",
    "the  software library implements the `` gibbs '' method @xcite in the aflow @xcite framework ( c++ based framework ) and the materials project @xcite ( python implementation ) .",
    "the library includes automatic error handling and correction to facilitate high - throughput computation of materials thermal properties .",
    "the principal ingredients of the calculation are described in the following sections .      in thermodynamics ,",
    "the equilibrium state of a system at a constant temperature and pressure minimizes its gibbs free energy @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a configuration vector containing all the information about the system s geometry , @xmath4 is the total energy of the crystal ( obtained , for example , from an electronic structure calculation ) , @xmath5 is the vibrational helmholtz free energy , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the pressure and volume .",
    "it is assumed here that the electronic and intrinsic point defect contributions to the helmholtz free energy is small , which is a good approximation for most materials at temperatures significantly below their melting point . in the quasi - harmonic approximation ,",
    "the helmholtz vibrational energy is @xmath8\\!g(\\vec{x } ; \\omega ) d\\omega , \\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the phonon density of states .",
    "as mentioned before , calculation of the full phonon density of states is computationally demanding , requiring electronic structure calculations for multiple supercell configurations .",
    "instead , the `` gibbs '' method uses a quasi - harmonic debye model , where the helmholtz free energy is expressed in terms of the debye temperature @xmath10 @xmath11 , \\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the number of atoms in the unit cell and @xmath13 is the debye integral @xmath14    in isotropic solids , changes in the geometry can be treated as isotropic changes in the volume , such that the magnitude of the configurational vector @xmath3 is equal to the cube root of the volume , i.e. @xmath15 . the value of @xmath16 can thus be calculated as@xcite @xmath17^{1/3 } f(\\sigma ) \\sqrt{\\frac{b_s}{m}}.\\ ] ] here , @xmath18 is the mass of the unit cell , @xmath19 is the adiabatic bulk modulus , and @xmath20 is given by @xmath21^{-1 } \\right\\}^{\\frac{1}{3}},\\ ] ] in the assumption that the poisson ratio @xmath22 is constant .",
    "the value of the poisson ratio can be set as an input to  separately from the dft calculations , e.g. , to the experimentally measured value .",
    "for the calculations described in this paper this value is set at 0.25 , which is the theoretical value for a cauchy solid @xcite .",
    "the poisson ratio @xmath22 for crystalline materials is typically in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 .",
    "since the function @xmath20 behaves approximately linearly with values running from 0.9 to 0.7 when @xmath22 is in the range from 0.2 to 0.3 , this approximation has only a small effect on the results .",
    "we have checked this by performing the  calculations using the literature values of the poisson ratio where they are available .",
    "the correlation between calculated and experimental values of the thermal conductivity is typically within a few percent of that obtained with the constant value of 0.25 .",
    "the adiabatic bulk modulus , b@xmath23 , can be approximated by the zero temperature limit of the isothermal compressibility ( neglecting zero - point contributions ) , which we will refer to as b@xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the configuration vector of the unit cell geometry .",
    "the gibbs free energy of the system can be expressed as a function of the unit cell volume @xmath27 where @xmath16 as a function of volume is evaluated from equations ( [ debyetemp ] ) and ( [ bulkmod ] ) , and @xmath28 is obtained from a set of dft calculations for unit cells with different volumes . minimizing the gibbs free energy with respect to volume , the equilibrium configuration at @xmath29 is determined , and additional properties , including the equilibrium @xmath10 , bulk modulus , heat capacity , thermal coefficient of expansion , etc .",
    "can be evaluated .      in order to calculate the thermal properties for a particular material with a particular structure , first a set of dft ( e.g. vasp @xcite ) calculations which only differ by isotropic variations in the unit cell volume",
    "are set up and run using the aflow or materials project framework .",
    "the resulting @xmath28 is fitted by a polynomial , to calculate the adiabatic bulk modulus , @xmath19 , as a function of volume from equation ( [ bulkmod ] ) .",
    "the @xmath19 values are then used to calculate the debye temperature @xmath10 for each unit cell volume from equation ( [ debyetemp ] ) .",
    "next , the vibrational helmholtz free energy @xmath30 as a function of volume , is calculated using equation ( [ helmholtzdebye ] ) for a given value of the temperature , @xmath31 .",
    "the zero - pressure gibbs free energy as a function of volume is then obtained by @xmath32 this gibbs free energy is fitted by a polynomial which is minimized with respect to volume to find the equilibrium volume for any given value of @xmath31 , at zero pressure .",
    "the polynomial is an expansion in @xmath33{v}$ ] .",
    "therefore , finite pressure can be added simply to the coefficient of the @xmath34 term .",
    "the volume which minimizes this modified polynomial for @xmath35 is the equilibrium volume that gives the gibbs free energy for each requested @xmath29 .",
    "this equilibrium volume is used to calculate the bulk modulus and debye temperature of the material as a function of @xmath6 and @xmath31 , from equations ( [ bulkmod ] ) and ( [ debyetemp ] ) , respectively .",
    "the dft calculations to obtain @xmath28 were performed using the vasp software @xcite with projector- augmented - wave pseudopotentials @xcite and the pbe parameterization of the generalized gradient approximation to the exchange - correlation functional @xcite .",
    "the energies were calculated at zero temperature and pressure , with spin polarization and without zero - point motion or lattice vibrations .",
    "the initial crystal structures were fully relaxed ( cell volume and shape and the basis atom coordinates inside the cell ) .",
    "an additional 100 different volume cells were calculated for each structure by increasing or decreasing the relaxed lattice parameter in fractional increments of 0.005 . numerical convergence to about 1 mev / atom was ensured by a high - energy cut - off ( 30% higher than the maximum cutoff of each of the potentials ) and a 8000 k - point monkhorst - pack @xcite or @xmath36-centred ( in the case of hexagonal unit cells ) mesh .",
    "the grneisen parameter describes how the thermal properties of a material vary with the unit cell size .",
    "it is defined by the phonon frequencies dependence on the unit cell volume @xmath37 debye s theory assumes that all mode frequencies vary with the volume in the same ratio as the cut - off frequency ( debye frequency ) , so the grneisen parameter can be expressed in terms of @xmath10 @xmath38 and calculated using the mie - grneisen equation @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the vibrational internal energy @xmath41.\\ ] ]    the expression in eq .",
    "( [ gamma_micro ] ) can also be related to the macroscopic definition via a weighted average with the heat capacities for each branch of the phonon spectrum @xmath42 that leads to the thermodynamic relations @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the density of the material .",
    "an alternative expression for the grneisen parameter was derived by slater under the assumption of a constant poisson ratio @xcite @xmath45    equations ( [ gruneisen_theta ] ) , ( [ miegruneisen ] ) , and ( [ slatergruneisen ] ) have all been implemented within the . unless otherwise specified , the values of the grneisen parameter listed in the results and used to calculate the thermal conductivity are obtained using equation ( [ miegruneisen ] ) , as this is generally considered more accurate than equation ( [ gruneisen_theta ] ) @xcite .      in the",
    ", the thermal conductivity is calculated by the method proposed by slack @xcite using the debye temperature and the grneisen parameter @xmath46{4}}{20 \\pi^3(1 - 0.514\\gamma^{-1 } + 0.228\\gamma^{-2 } ) } \\times \\\\ \\nonumber   & & \\times \\left ( \\frac{k_b \\theta_\\acoustic}{\\hbar } \\right)^2 \\frac{k_b m v^{\\frac{1}{3}}}{\\hbar \\gamma^2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the volume of the unit cell and @xmath48 is the average atomic mass . it should be noted that the debye temperature in this formula , @xmath49 , is slightly different than the traditional debye temperature , @xmath10 , calculated in equation ( [ debyetemp ] ) .",
    "instead , @xmath49 is obtained by only considering the acoustic modes , based on the assumption that the optical phonon modes in crystals do not contribute to heat transport @xcite .",
    "this @xmath49 is referred to as the `` acoustic '' debye temperature @xcite .",
    "it can be derived directly from the phonon dos by integrating only over the acoustic modes @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it can be calculated from the traditional debye temperature @xmath10 @xcite @xmath50 to demonstrate the distinction between these two quantities , we include the values of both @xmath10 and @xmath49 , as calculated using , in the tables of results in the following sections .",
    "the thermal conductivity at temperatures other than @xmath49 is estimated by @xcite : @xmath51    in principle , the grneisen parameter in equation ( [ thermal_conductivity ] ) should also be derived only from the acoustic phonon modes @xcite . however , unlike the case of @xmath10 and @xmath49 , there is no simple way to extract it from the traditional grneisen parameter .",
    "instead , it must be calculated from equation ( [ gamma_micro ] ) for each phonon branch separately and summed over the acoustic branches .",
    "this requires calculating the full phonon spectrum for different volumes , and is therefore too computationally demanding to be used for high - throughput screening .",
    "the dependence of the expression ( [ thermal_conductivity ] ) on @xmath52 is weak @xcite , thus the evaluation of @xmath53 using the traditional grneisen parameter introduces just a small systematic error which is insignificant for screening purposes .",
    "pearson and spearman correlations have been implemented separately from , in order to analyze the results for entire sets of materials .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient @xmath54 is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "it is calculated by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the mean values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the spearman rank correlation coefficient @xmath44 is a measure of the monotonicity of the relation between two variables .",
    "the raw values of the two variables @xmath60 and @xmath61 are sorted in ascending order , and are assigned rank values @xmath62 and @xmath63 which are equal to their position in the sorted list .",
    "if there is more than one variable with the same value , the average of the position values are assigned to each .",
    "the correlation coefficient is then given by @xmath64    it is useful for determining how well the ranking order of the values of one variable predict the ranking order of the values of the other variable .",
    "we used the  to calculate the the debye temperature , grneisen parameter and thermal conductivity for a set of 75 materials with the diamond , zincblende , rocksalt and wurzite structures , and 107 half - heusler compounds .",
