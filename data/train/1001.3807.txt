    "what are the entanglement properties of quantum many - body states which characterize ground states of hamiltonians with local interactions ?",
    "the answer seems to be `` an area law '' : the bipartite entanglement between any region and its complement grows as the area separating them  and not as their volume , as is the case for a random state ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "moreover , particular corrections to this scaling law are linked with critical points ( logarithmic corrections ) or topological order ( additive corrections )",
    ". a rigorous general proof of the area law , however , could up to now only be given for the case of one - dimensional systems  @xcite , where an area law has been proven for all systems with an energy gap above the ground state , whereas the currently strongest result for two dimensions  @xcite requires a hypothesis on the eigenvalue distribution of the hamiltonian . surprisingly , there is a completely general proof in arbitrary dimensions if instead , we consider the corresponding quantity for thermal states  @xcite , and similar links to topological order persist  @xcite .",
    "the area law can be taken as a guideline for designing classes of quantum states which allow to faithfully approximate ground states of local hamiltonians .",
    "there are several of these classes in the literature : matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite and projected entangled pair states ( peps )  @xcite are most directly motivated by the area law , but there are other approaches such as mera ( the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz )  @xcite which e.g.  is based on the scale invariance of critical systems ; all these classes are summarized under the name of tensor network or tensor product states . though the main motivation to introduce them was numerical ",
    "they consitute variational ansatzes over which one minimizes the energy of a target hamiltonians and thus obtains an approximate description of the ground state",
    " they have turned out to be powerful tools for characterizing the role of entanglement in quantum many body systems , and thus helped to improve our understanding of their physics .    in this paper , we are going to present a theoretical framework which allows us to understand how mps and peps appear as ground states of local hamiltonians , and to characterize the properties of their ground state subspace .",
    "this encompasses previously known results for mps and particular instances of peps , while simultaneously giving rise to a range of new phenomena , in particular topological effects .",
    "our work is motivated by the contrast between the rather complete understanding in one and the rather sparse picture in two dimensions , and we will review what is known in the following .",
    "we will thereby focus on analytical results , and refer the reader interested in numerical aspects to  @xcite .",
    "matrix product states ( mps )  @xcite form a family of one - dimensional quantum states whose description is inherently local , in the sense that the degree to which two spins can be correlated is related to their distance .",
    "the total amount of correlations across any cut is controlled by a parameter called the _ bond dimension _ , such that increasing the bond dimension allows to grow the set of states described .",
    "mps have a long history , which was renewed in 1992 when two apparently independent papers appeared : in  @xcite , fannes , nachtergaele , and werner generalized the aklt construction of  @xcite by introducing the so - called finitely correlated states , which in retrospect can be interpreted as mps defined on an infinite chain ; in fact , this work layed the basis for our understanding of mps and introduced many techniques which later proved useful in characterizing mps  @xcite .",
    "the other was  @xcite , where white introduced the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm , which can now be understood as a variational algorithm over the set of mps . in  @xcite ,",
    "mps were explained from a quantum information point of view by distributing `` virtual '' maximally entangled pairs between adjacent sites which can only be partially accessed by acting on the physical system .",
    "this entanglement - based perspective has since then fostered a wide variety of results .",
    "motivated by the extreme success of dmrg , people investigated how hard or easy the problem of approximating the ground state of a 1d local hamiltonian ( or simply its energy ) was .",
    "the history of this problem is full of interesting positive and negative results .",
    "a number of them was devoted to prove that every ground state of a gapped 1d local hamiltonian can be approximated by an mps  @xcite ; this was finally proven by hastings  @xcite , justifying the use of mps as the appropriate representation of the state of one - dimensional spin systems .",
    "very recently , also in the positive , it was shown that dynamical programming could be used to find the best approximation to the ground state of a one - dimensional system within the set of mps with fixed bond dimension in a provably efficient way  @xcite . on the other hand , in the negative it could be shown",
    "that finding the ground state energy of hamiltonians whose ground states are mps with a bond dimension polynomial in the system size is np - hard  @xcite ; this is based on a previous result of aharonov _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite proving that finding the ground state energy of 1d hamiltonians is qma - complete ( the quantum version of np - complete ) .",
    "as we have seen , mps provide the right description for one - dimensional quantum spin chains .",
    "therefore , and given their simple structure , one can employ mps to improve our understanding of the physics of one - dimensional systems .",
    "one field in which significant insight could be gained was the characterization of symmetries in terms of entanglement .",
    "first , the relation between string order parameters and localizable entanglement was explained in  @xcite . in  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , global symmetries in generic mps have been characterized , and related to the existence of string order parameters , thus explaining many of the properties of string order , for instance its fragility @xcite .",
    "this characterization of global symmetries was generalized to arbitrary mps in @xcite , where it was used to shed light on the hamiltonian - free nature of the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem as well as to find new @xmath3invariant two - body hamiltonians with mps ground states , beyond the aklt and majumdar - ghosh models .",
    "other examples of mps with global symmetries were already provided in @xcite .",
    "recently , also reflection symmetry has been investigated , showing how it provides topological protection of some mps such as the odd - spin aklt model , as opposed to the even - spin case  @xcite .",
    "mps have also been extremely useful in understanding the scaling of entanglement in quantum spin chains , where special attention has been devoted to the case of quantum phase transitions . in @xcite , mps were used to give examples of phase transitions with unexpected properties , namely analytic ground state energy and finite entanglement entropy of an infinite half - chain ; the entanglement properties of these examples were further analyzed in @xcite . in @xcite , mps theory was used to compute how the geometric entanglement with respect to large blocks diverges logarithmically with the correlation length near a critical point , and thus takes the role of an order parameter ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "apart from that , mps theory has been used to decompose global operations ( such as cloning or the creation of an entangled state ) into a sequence of local operations  @xcite , to characterize renormalization group transformations and their fixed points in 1d @xcite , to understand which quantum circuits can be simulated classically @xcite , or even to propose new numerical methods to solve differential equations @xcite or to compress images @xcite .",
    "but what is it that makes mps so useful in deriving all these results ?",
    "the main reason seems to be that mps , despite being able to faithfully represent the states of one - dimensional systems , have a simple and well - understood structure , which makes them quite easy to deal with .",
    "for instance , as shown in @xcite , they naturally reflect the schmidt decomposition at any cut across the chain , which makes dealing with their entanglement properties particularly easy .",
    "if one moreover restricts to the physically relevant case of translational invariant states , it turns out that one can fully characterize the set of all translationally invariant mps by bringing them into a canonical form  @xcite ; in fact this canonical form constitutes one of the main ingredients in many of the results mentioned above .    in the canonical form ,",
    "the matrices characterizing the mps obtain a block diagonal form , and the properties of the state can be simply read off the structure of these blocks . in particular , for the case of one block ( termed the _ injective _ case ) , it can be shown that the mps arises as the unique ground state of a so - called `` parent '' hamiltonian with local interactions , which moreover is frustration free .",
    "for the _ non - injective _ case where one has several blocks , the number of blocks determines the degeneracy of the parent hamiltonian , and the ground state subspace is spanned by the injective mps described by the individual blocks  @xcite . beyond that",
    ", the injective case has other nice properties , such as an exponential decay of correlations . for the case of an infinite chain ,",
    "all these properties were proven in @xcite , together with the fact that the parent hamiltonian of an injective mps has an energy gap above the ground state .",
    "the block structure of the canonical form is also useful beyond the relation of hamiltonians and ground states , and e.g.  allows to read off the type of the rg fixed point of a given 1d system .",
    "projected entangled pair states ( peps ) constitute the natural generalization of mps to two and higher dimensions , motivated by the quantum information perspective on mps which views them as arising from virtual entangled pairs between nearest neighbors  @xcite .",
    "though there has not yet been a complete formal proof that peps approximate efficiently all ground states of gapped local hamiltonians , this could be proven under a ( realistic ) assumption on the spectral density in the low - energy regime  @xcite , showing that peps are the appropriate class to describe a large variety of two - dimensional systems .",
    "however , as compared to mps , peps are much harder to deal with : for instance , computing expectation values of local observables , which would be the key ingredient in any variational algorithm such as dmrg , is a # p - complete problem , and thus in particular np - hard  @xcite .",
    "this poses an obstacle to numerical methods , and different ideas to overcome this problem have been proposed ( we refer again to @xcite for numerical issues ) .",
    "fortunately , the bad news comes with good ones : the increase in complexity allows to find a much larger variety of different interesting behavior within peps as compared to mps ; for instance , in @xcite it is shown that there exist peps with a power - law decay of two - point correlation functions , something which can not be achieved for mps .",
    "there have been identified various different classes of peps which exhibit rich properties . to start with , in  @xcite it has been shown how the interpretation of the 2d cluster state as a peps can be used to understand measurement based quantum computation  @xcite  a way of performing a quantum computation solely by measurements  by viewing it as a way to carry out the computation as teleportation - based computation on the virtal maximally entangled states underlying the peps description .",
    "this motivated the search for different models for measurement based quantum computation , and indeed models with very different properties have been subsequently proposed  @xcite .",
    "another category of examples has been found with regard to topological models , where it was realized that many topologically ordered states have a peps representation with a small bond dimension : the case of kitaev s toric code was observed in @xcite , and this was later generalized to all string net models in @xcite . yet , despite their ability to _ describe _ these states , up to now peps did not help much in _ understanding _ the topological behavior of these states , which is one of the things we will assess in this work .",
    "as we have seen , the class of peps is rich enough to incorporate states with a variety of different behaviors .",
    "however , given the complexity of topological systems or of ( measurement based ) quantum computation , is this class still simple enough to prove useful as a tool to improve our understanding of 2d systems ?",
    "that is , can peps help to uncover new effects and relations in nature , or to give a better understanding of the mechanisms behind quantum effects in two dimensions ?",
    "judging from the experience with one - dimensional systems , in order to do so it would be highly desirable to have an understanding of the structure of peps comparable to the one obtained using the canonical form in one dimension .",
    "as it turns out , in the case of `` injective '' peps , several 1d results can be transferred ; in particular , injective peps appear as unique ground states of their parent hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "also , in  @xcite it is shown how global symmetries can be characterized in injective peps , which helped to understand the mechanism behind the 2d version of the lieb - schultz - mattis theorem  @xcite , to define an appropriate analogue for string orders in 2d  @xcite , and to improve the peps - based algorithms used to simulate 2d systems with symmetries  @xcite .",
    "while these results illustrate that peps are a useful tool to understand properties of quantum states which appear as unique ground states of local hamiltonians , it is also true that some of the most interesting physics in two dimensions takes place in systems which do not have unique ground states , but rather lowly degenerate ones , such as systems with symmetry broken phases or states with topological order .    yet , in order to be able to fully apply the toolbox of peps to the understanding of these systems , it would be crucial to have a mathematical characterization of the structure of peps , providing a framework similar to the one which proved so useful for one - dimensional systems : is there a canonical form for peps which allows to easily determine their properties , and how can it be found ?",
    "how do peps appear as ground states of local `` parent '' hamiltonians , and what is the ground state degeneracy ?",
    "what is the structure of the ground state subspace , and how do these states relate to the peps under consideration ?      in this paper , we introduce a framework for characterizing both mps and peps in terms of symmetries of the underlying tensors .",
    "this classification allows us to rederive all results known for one - dimensional systems , while it can be equally applied to the characterization of two- and higher - dimensional peps states , answering the aforementioned questions : using the characterization based on symmetries , we prove how peps appear as ground states of local hamiltonians with finitely degenerate ground states , and how these states can be obtained as variants of the original state .",
    "subsequently , we demonstrate the power of our framework by using it to explain in a simple and coherent way the topological properties of these ground states : we prove that these states are locally indistinguishable and can be transformed into each other by acting on a restricted region , we explain the origin of the topological entropy , and we discuss how to renormalize these states based on their symmetries .",
    "we also discuss the excitations of these hamiltonians , and demonstrate how to understand their anyonic statistics as a consequence of their symmetries .",
    "thus , the characterization of peps in terms of symmetries provides a powerful framework which allows to explain a large range of their properties in a coherent and natural way .",

    "first , we define the `` projector ''  the map which creates the physical system from the virtual layer .    for an mps given by a tensor @xmath12 , @xmath27 is the map which maps the virtual system to the physical one .",
    "the definition extends directly to peps .",
    "the importance of the map @xmath28 lies in the fact that it tells us how virtual and the physical space of the mps are connected . on the one hand",
    ", it tells us which physical states can be created by acting on the virtual degrees of freedom , and on the other hand , it tells us which virtual configurations  which in turn enforce physical configurations on the surrounding sites  can be realized by acting on the physical system .",
    "thus , studying the properties of @xmath29 will allow us to infer properties of the mps .",
    "let us now see which simplifications we can make in the analysis of @xmath29 , given that we are only interested in the non - local properties of the mps ( peps ) . define @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "then , @xmath29 can be inverted on @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively : @xmath34 note that @xmath33 characterizes the local support of the mps : projecting sites @xmath35 on any basis state @xmath36 leaves us with @xmath37{\\left|i_1\\right\\rangle}$ ] ( where @xmath38 ) , and thus , the single - site reduced operator is supported on @xmath33 .",
    "thus , we can restrict the mps to the subspace @xmath39 , i.e. , each local system can be mapped to a @xmath40dimensional system by a local isometry , i.e. , without changing any non - local properties .",
    "this implies that we can w.l.o.g .",

    "the framework for understanding rg fixed points by mapping between isomorphic representations suggests the extension to the case of renormalization flows , e.g.  by considering the tensor product of individual bond symmetries . for instance , one could use the fact that the normalized character of the tensor product of any faithful representation converges to the character of the regular representation , up to global phases , to show that rg flows converge towards @xmath114isometric peps .",

    "<S> we introduce a framework for characterizing matrix product states ( mps ) and projected entangled pair states ( peps ) in terms of symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to understand how peps appear as ground states of local hamiltonians with finitely degenerate ground states and to characterize the ground state subspace . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we apply our framework to show how the topological properties of these ground states can be explained solely from the symmetry : we prove that ground states are locally indistinguishable and can be transformed into each other by acting on a restricted region , we explain the origin of the topological entropy , and we discuss how to renormalize these states based on their symmetries . finally , we show how the anyonic character of excitations can be understood as a consequence of the underlying symmetries .    </S>",
