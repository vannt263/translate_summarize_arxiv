    "the ` @xmath5-cold dark matter ' ( @xmath5cdm ) model is now broadly accepted as the standard paradigm in cosmology .",
    "this model completely specifies the initial conditions for the formation of cosmic structure , as well as the values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "thus , in principle , it is possible to calculate the predicted evolution of objects of any kind , provided that the relevant astrophysical processes are understood .",
    "the complexity of these processes makes computer simulations the ideal tool to investigate the formation of structure in the universe .",
    "there is a long history of attempts to simulate the formation of spiral galaxies from @xmath5cdm initial conditions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "early on an ` angular momentum problem ' was identified . in the @xmath5cdm model ,",
    "galaxies are generally assembled by mergers .",
    "as fragments merge , their angular momentum , which is primarily invested in their orbits , is transferred to the outer halo .",
    "thus , if these fragments already carry within them the majority of the baryons which will make up the final galaxy , then these baryons will end up in a slowly rotating central spheroid rather than in a disc @xcite .",
    "the likely solution to the problem was also identified early on : the baryons must be kept from cooling into the fragments , perhaps by some form of feedback , until the merging activity has subsided after which they can cool smoothly to form a disc @xcite .",
    "the nature of the angular momentum problem and the key role of feedback were explicitly demonstrated by @xcite who simulated the formation of three galaxies  all in the same dark matter halo  assuming three different models of feedback powered by the energy liberated in supernovae ( sne ) .",
    "the resulting three galaxies spanned the whole range of morphological types , from a pure spheroid to a disc galaxy with bulge - to - total mass ratio of 0.5 .",
    "@xcite explored these galaxies further and showed how , when the feedback is not strong enough to prevent gas cooling early on , a spheroid forms , whereas strong feedback can result in the formation of a disc by infall of gas which approximately conserves its angular momentum .",
    "the physical processes that establish the feedback loops required for disc galaxies to form are poorly understood , but almost certainly involve sne energy and perhaps also energy extracted from a central black hole ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these processes occur on scales which are many orders of magnitude below those that can be followed directly in galaxy simulations from @xmath5cdm initial conditions .",
    "they must therefore be treated as ` sub - grid ' physics .",
    "a number of authors have attempted this kind of modelling using various recipes leading to a new generation of simulations which are producing increasingly realistic disc galaxies @xcite .",
    "although a full physical understanding of how galactic feedback processes work seems a long way away , it is worth trying to identify or constrain the ` macroscopic ' properties to which those processes must give rise for a galaxy simulation to be successful .",
    "since it seems clear that much of the activity must take place early on , a promising approach is to investigate how different feedback models influence the properties of surviving fragments which appear today as satellites of the main galaxy .",
    "this is the approach we take in this paper : we focus on the luminosity function and metallicity of satellites and examine how these properties are affected by different models of feedback .",
    "the properties of satellites are interesting in their own right .",
    "for example , their luminosity function has often been claimed to pose a major problem for the cdm model because the number of satellites seen around the milky way is several orders of magnitude smaller than the number of substructures that survive the collapse of galactic haloes in @xmath0-body simulations @xcite . however , there are various feedback processes that could explain why only a tiny fraction of subhaloes manage to make stars .",
    "sn heating is clearly one of them @xcite ; another is the photoionization of gas at early times , which suppresses gas cooling and raises the thermal pressure of the gas , preventing it from accreting onto small dark matter haloes @xcite .",
    "these processes can be readily modelled using semi - analytic techniques and such studies have shown that indeed they greatly reduce the number of visible satellites ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "some doubt has recently been cast on the validity of these important conclusion because both the early studies and the more recent , but similar ones by @xcite and @xcite , were based on gnedin s ( 2000 ) filtering mass description of reionization which appears to overestimate significantly the suppression of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite , however , have shown that even with the weaker suppression advocated by @xcite , acceptable satellite luminosity functions can still be obtained .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations are well suited for studying complex processes such as reionization and sn feedback _ ab initio _ , with a minimum of simplifying assumptions .",
    "an earlier generation of galaxy simulations showed that at least the brightest satellite galaxies are produced in acceptable numbers @xcite .",
    "these simulations , however , lacked the numerical resolution required to study the bulk of the observed milky way satellites .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper include a number of baryonic processes known to be relevant to galaxy formation .",
    "in particular , we model sn feedback as winds , a phenomenological approach which was originally introduced by @xcite .",
    "@xcite modified this treatment allowing the wind speed and mass - loading to vary with galaxy properties , while @xcite introduced a model in which the energy in the winds reflects the timed - release of sn energy . unlike in previous simulations , @xcite considered the case in which wind particles are allowed to interact hydrodynamically with interstellar medium ( ism ) particles and found that due to hydrodynamical drag in the ism , both the _ effective _ wind speed and the _ effective _ mass - loading ( i.e. the wind speed and mass - loading when the wind leaves the star - forming region ) change significantly from the _ input _ wind speed and mass - loading .",
    "this type of wind models are also used in recent cosmological simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "winds are now observed in many star - forming galaxies .",
    "earlier data @xcite suggested that their properties were independent of galactic properties .",
    "more recent observations @xcite , however , have reversed this view : galaxies with higher circular velocity and higher star formation rates appear to drive faster winds . in this paper , we consider two types of wind models , both of which assume that all the energy released from sne is converted into the kinetic energy of the winds . in one case ,",
    "the wind speed is assumed to be constant , as in @xcite and as suggested by the earlier data @xcite . in the other case ,",
    "the wind speed is assumed to be proportional to the local velocity dispersion , as suggested by the more recent data @xcite .",
    "similar , but different wind models have been used successfully to investigate the ejection of intergalactic metals @xcite and the galaxy mass - metallicity relation of massive galaxies ( @xmath6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we describe our simulations , providing brief descriptions of our modelling of baryonic processes ( section  2.1 ) , the energetic and chemical feedback due to stellar evolution ( section  2.2 ) and the implementation of winds ( section  2.3 ) . in section  3",
    "we present our results .",
    "we first focus on the properties of the central galaxies ( section  3.1 ) .",
    "we then address how the luminosity functions and metallicities of the satellite galaxies are affected by different feedback prescriptions ( section  3.2 ) . in section  3.3",
    "we perform convergence tests by using a higher resolution simulation .",
    "finally , in section  4 , we discuss the results and summarise our main conclusions .",
    "we selected the three most massive objects from the sample of six aquarius haloes described in @xcite .",
    "the aquarius haloes , extracted from a large cosmological simulation , were chosen to be relatively isolated and to have masses suitable to host a milky way - like galaxy . with one exception , which is not in our sample , they all have a relatively quiet merger history since @xmath7 .",
    "the three most massive haloes are : aq - a , aq - c , and aq - d .",
    "halo aq - a has the quietest merger history of the whole sample and has been studied in the most detail to date .",
    "all our simulations follow galaxy formation within a periodic cube of side @xmath8  mpc in a @xmath5cdm cosmology with parameters : @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "these values are the same as those adopted for the millennium simulation  @xcite and the aquarius project , and , within the uncertainties , are consistent with the current set of constraints from the wmap 1-year @xcite and 5-year @xcite data .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation in all six aquarius haloes have been presented by @xcite .",
    "these have similar resolution to our simulations but use a different code and focus on different issues .",
    "they employed a slightly lower value of the mean baryon density , @xmath11 , than us . in that work ,",
    "aq - c , produced the most disc - dominated galaxy and had the smallest mass fraction in subhaloes within @xmath12 ( the radius inside which the density is fifty times the critical density ) .",
    "aq - d has a similar halo mass to aq - a and aq - c smaller than these haloes ] .",
    "the concentration parameter of this halo is the smallest of the three we have chosen . , for haloes aq",
    "- a , aq - c , and aq - d , obtained by fitting an nfw density profile  @xcite , are @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , respectively @xcite . ]",
    "since hydrodynamic simulations are much more computationally expensive than @xmath0-body simulations with the same number of dark matter particles , we are only able to simulate haloes at the lowest and next - to - lowest resolution employed in @xcite ( corresponding to levels 5 and 4 in that paper ) . to test for numerical convergence , we carried out a high resolution simulation of aq - d , to which we refer as aq - d - hr ( which corresponds to level 4 ) . in table",
    "[ resolution ] , we summarise the halo properties , the particle masses and the gravitational softenings used for the simulations .",
    "the simulation code was developed from an early version of gadget-3 .",
    "this is similar to the publicly available gadget-2 @xcite , but it has a more efficient load - balancing algorithm .",
    "we have modified gadget-3 to follow a number of additional physical processes as follows .    both photo - heating by a spatially uniform , time - evolving ultraviolet background and radiative cooling depend on gas metallicity , as described in  @xcite , by assuming the gas to be optically thin and in ionization equilibrium .",
    "we use the ultraviolet background given by @xcite which is switched on at z = 9 ( see also @xcite )",
    ". the cooling / heating routine described by @xcite computes the cooling / heating rates individually for eleven elements whose contribution to the radiative cooling is significant ( h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ca , and fe ) . in the simulations , we track only nine elements and we take s and ca to be proportional to si ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as in @xcite , we use the smoothed metallicity , rather than the particle metallicity ( which is normally used ) , to compute the photo - heating and radiative cooling rates and to give the initial amount of each individual chemical element to newly - born stars .",
    "@xcite found that the particle metallicity underestimates the metallicity of relatively unenriched gas compared to the smoothed value and thus significantly underpredicts the total stellar mass formed in their cosmological simulations .",
    "using the particle metallicity is particularly problematic when a small fraction of metal enriched particles are ejected as winds , as in our simulations .",
    "star formation is modelled as in @xcite .",
    "that is , we treat an sph particle whose density exceeds a threshold density for star formation ( @xmath16 ) as a hybrid particle that contains two distinct phases : hot ambient gas and cold clouds , as in @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the clouds have a fixed mass spectrum and the star formation rate in a giant molecular cloud is a function of the ambient pressure according to the two - phase model of @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced an alternative to the hybrid particle approach in which the cold clouds are represented by sticky particles ( and hot , warm , and diffuse phases are represented by sph particles ) .",
    "while this model shares many physical processes with our model , such as cloud formation by thermal instability and cooling and evaporation by thermal conduction , it allows the cloud mass spectrum to evolve with time through coagulation .",
    "stellar evolution is modelled as in @xcite , with two exceptions : ( i ) we employ the more realistic chabrier initial mass function ( imf , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , instead of the salpeter imf @xcite ; and ( ii ) we use metallicity - dependent stellar lifetimes and chemical yields @xcite .",
    "the code does not assume the instantaneous recycling approximation .",
    "the production of metals by sne and agb stars , stellar mass loss and sn feedback all take place on the timescale dictated by stellar evolution considerations .",
    "it is however important to note that published nucleosynthesis yields and stellar lifetimes vary significantly amongst authors .",
    "a detailed discussion of this topic may be found in @xcite .",
    "the stellar population synthesis model p@xmath17gase2 @xcite is used to calculate the luminosity of the simulated galaxies .",
    "we now discuss the technical implementation of important `` subgrid '' processes included in our simulations .      in our simulations each star particle represents a simple stellar population ( ssp ) , specified by its imf , age , and metallicity . all stars more massive than @xmath18",
    "are assumed to explode as sne  ii .",
    "as the simulation proceeds , the supernova energy , mass loss , and associated metals produced by a star particle are spread out over neighbouring particles .",
    "we use the lifetime and yields given by @xcite .",
    "while it would be most natural to distribute these quantities at each of the timesteps used to compute the dynamics , this proves to be prohibitively expensive computationally ( particularly for sne  ia ) .",
    "we adopt instead a more economical stochastic scheme , introduced by @xcite , in which the distribution operation takes place within a smaller number of discrete time intervals during the lifetime of an individual star particle .    from the time a star particle is born until it reaches the age , @xmath19 ,",
    "corresponding to the lifetime of an @xmath18 star , ( @xmath20  myr for solar metallicity ) , the distribution of mass , metals and supernova energy to neighbouring particles occurs in a series of discrete events set by a timestep , @xmath21 , of magnitude a fiftieth of @xmath22 .",
    "after an age @xmath23 there are no more sne  ii , and a longer controlling timestep is introduced : @xmath24 = 100 myrs .",
    "this longer step is chosen specifically to follow sne  ia , but it is also sufficiently small to allow the distribution of elements produced by agb stars , as well as stellar mass loss from the ssp as a whole . in general ,",
    "the dynamical timestep , @xmath25 , is much shorter than either @xmath21 or @xmath24 . as a precaution , however , for star particles with an age less than @xmath22 , the dynamical time is explicitly limited to a maximum of half of @xmath21 .    for a star particle with an age , @xmath26",
    ", we define the conditional probability that the star particle undergoes a discrete event resulting in the distribution of energy , mass , and metals during a particular dynamical timestep , @xmath25 , as follows :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the sn  ii rate for the ssp of age @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the age when the previous sn  ii timestep finished .",
    "the sn  ii rate , @xmath28 , can be directly computed from the imf , @xmath31 , and the stellar lifetime , @xmath32 as @xmath33 where the imf is normalised as @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the upper and lower limits of the imf respectively .",
    "( we assume @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) the total number of sne  ii produced by an ssp of @xmath39 is @xmath40 .",
    "we generate a uniform random number between zero and one at every @xmath41 .",
    "when @xmath42 exceeds this number , the energy , mass , and metals expelled by the ssp during the interval @xmath30 to @xmath43 are distributed over the neighbouring gas particles and the probability is set to zero until the end of this sn  ii timestep during @xmath21 is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the energy released by each supernova which , throughout this paper , we take to be @xmath46 .    the energy , metals and mass produced by a particle are distributed amongst its 40 nearest neighbouring gas particles at each of these discrete events .",
    "it is important that each quantity that is being redistributed be accurately conserved . to ensure that this happens",
    ", the fraction of each quantity received by the @xmath47-th gas particle neighbouring the star is given by @xmath48 , where the subscript @xmath49 runs over all 40 neighbours .",
    "we find that the results are relatively insensitive to the exact number of neighbours , with 32128 particles producing similar behaviour .",
    "the same procedure applies after an age @xmath22 , except that the timestep is now @xmath24 .",
    "we calculate the sn  ia rate using the scheme of @xcite with the updated parameters of @xcite .",
    "we take chemical yields and stellar mass loss from intermediate mass stars from @xcite .",
    "further details may be found in @xcite , @xcite and references therein .    in summary ,",
    "our method for treating feedback and mass loss allows us to perform the expensive neighbour search only once per star particle per sn timestep and results in the correct distribution of sne in time , even with large sn timesteps , when averaged over many particles .",
    "note that the method guarantees a single distribution event per star particle per sn timestep .      in our subgrid model of feedback ,",
    "sn explosions give rise to a wind by imparting kinetic energy to nearby gas particles .",
    "we assume that all of the energy released from sne is potentially available to power the kinetic energy of the wind . hence in terms of feedback efficiency ,",
    "there is no difference among our models . in order to prevent gas particles outside star - forming regions from being launched as winds , we assume that only star - forming gas particles ( @xmath50 @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the threshold density above which star formation can occur ) are eligible to become wind particles .",
    "if low density gas particles ( @xmath53 ) receive feedback energy , we simply add it to their internal energy .    during",
    "any given timestep , an eligible gas particle may receive supernova energy , @xmath54 , from one or more neighbouring star particles .",
    "if this happens , then the particle is selected to become a wind particle during that timestep with a probability : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mass of the gas particle and @xmath1 is the initial wind speed .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is discussed later in this subsection .",
    "having decided whether a particle is to become a wind particle or not , we set its value , @xmath57 .",
    "this procedure ensures that the kinetic energy is injected _ locally _ and that the generation of winds is consistent with the timed release of sn energy and metals .",
    "this is an important difference from the widely used wind model of @xcite in which the wind particles are selected stochastically from all the star - forming gas ( i.e. with @xmath58 ) in the simulation and are therefore not local to young star particles .",
    "a different implementation of locally generated winds can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is possible for @xmath59 to exceed unity .",
    "we deal with this situation using an iterative procedure .",
    "firstly , the particle is added to the wind and we record both its label and the value of its ` excess ' energy , @xmath60 .",
    "having considered all eligible gas particles to decide which become wind particles , we then revisit those with excess energy and redistribute this energy to neighbouring non - wind gas particles .",
    "we then consider those particles whose density makes them eligible to be selected as a wind particle , recompute @xmath59 including the reassigned excess energy from @xmath54 in eqn .",
    "[ p_w ] , and decide whether they are converted into wind particles or not in the usual way . if there are still values of @xmath59 which exceed unity , a further iteration is begun , and these iterations continue until there is no more excess energy to redistribute . in practise",
    "no more than two iterations are ever required .",
    "when a particle is selected as a wind particle , its velocity , @xmath61 , is incremented as : @xmath62 the unit vector @xmath63 is chosen at random to be either parallel or anti - parallel to the vector @xmath64 , where @xmath65 ideally would be chosen to be the velocity of the centre of mass of the galaxy . since it is difficult to determine this velocity as the simulation proceeds , we instead select the average velocity of the neighbouring 40 dark matter particles as a proxy .",
    "the gravitational acceleration , @xmath66 , on the other hand , includes contributions from matter everywhere in the simulation . in practise , for the central regions of haloes and subhaloes , both the magnitude and direction of @xmath66",
    "are largely determined by the local mass distribution .",
    "adding a velocity according to eqn .",
    "[ direction - eq ] leads to wind particles being ejected preferentially along the rotation axis of a spinning object , thus generating an ` axial wind ' @xcite .",
    "note that while the momentum is not strictly balanced when a single particle is placed in the wind , the momentum and angular momentum are statistically conserved because of the random orientation of the momentum kick along direction @xmath67 . since the physical mechanisms that drive the outflows in galaxies are not well understood and the mass in winds is hardly constrained by observations , we adopt two phenomenological models for the properties of the winds ( both of which assume that all of the supernova energy is available to power the outflows ) .",
    "the first model ( which we label ` vw ' for ` variable wind ' ) assumes that the initial wind speed , @xmath68 , is proportional to the one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath2 , determined from the 40 neighbouring dark matter particles of the gas particle in question .",
    "that is , in the vw model , @xmath69 , as suggested by recent data @xcite . here",
    ", we are taking the local velocity dispersion as a proxy for the circular velocity .",
    "we have checked that the local velocity dispersion measured at the position of a star - forming gas particle is strongly correlated with the maximum of the circular velocity profile of its host ( sub)halo , @xmath70 , and that the relation between them ( @xmath71 ) does not evolve with redshift .    in order to characterise the ` vw ' models",
    ", we discuss wind properties by assuming the instantaneous recycling approximation and considering only sne  ii as the energy source for the winds . while we do not make these assumptions in the simulations , considering this simplest of cases is instructive . with these assumptions ,",
    "the energy ejection rate , @xmath72 , is proportional to the star formation rate , @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , the mass flux in the winds in the ` vw ' models , @xmath74 , can be written as : @xmath75 because the wind speed , @xmath1 , is proportional to the local dark matter velocity dispersion , @xmath2 . from these considerations ,",
    "the wind mass - loading , @xmath76 , can be expressed as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a parameter defined by the imf and the feedback efficiency .",
    "we give the values of @xmath78 in our models in table  [ params ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we adopt the chabrier imf and make use of all the sn energy to power the kinetic energy of the winds .    for the second wind model ( which we label ` cw ' for ` constant wind ' ) ,",
    "we assume a constant initial wind speed , which implies a constant mass - loading . this type of wind model has been widely used in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in both",
    "the ` vw ' and ` cw ' models , we assume that newly launched wind particles are _ decoupled _ from hydrodynamical interactions for a brief period of time in order to enable the winds to emerge from a location close to the surface of their star - forming region with the _ specified _ wind velocity and mass - loading .",
    "this wind decoupling has been widely used in simulations since it was introduced by @xcite .",
    "@xcite compared _ coupled _ ( i.e. not decoupled ) and _ decoupled _ winds in detail and found that coupled winds blow bubbles and drive turbulence or create channels in the gas disc , while decoupled winds remove fuel for star formation without disturbing the gas disc .",
    "more importantly , for a given set of ( input ) wind speed and mass - loading , coupled winds are more efficient at suppressing star formation in low mass galaxies because they drag gas along ; consequently the mass - loading when they leave the star - forming region ( i.e. the effective mass - loading ) is much larger than the input one . on the other hand ,",
    "coupled winds are less efficient in high mass galaxies because they suffer large energy losses due to drag in the high - pressure ism and the decelerated winds can not escape from the galaxy ( or often even from the star - forming region )  @xcite .    since we wish to investigate the effects of two different feedback models on the population of satellite galaxies , in which wind speed and mass - loading depend differently on the galaxy properties , we employ _ decoupled _ winds in this paper in order to specify the _ effective _ wind velocity and mass - loading as inputs .",

    "previous sph simulations had already shown that an acceptable match to the abundance of bright satellites can be obtained from @xmath5cdm initial conditions @xcite , thus confirming the conclusion from early semi - analytic studies that the so - called ` satellite problem ' in the cdm cosmology @xcite disappears when proper account is taken of the baryonic processes involved in galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "our high - resolution simulation , however , extends the comparison with the luminosity function to much fainter magnitudes than previous sph simulations .",
    "the ` vw ' feedback model that produces an acceptable satellite luminosity function , also produces an acceptable luminosity - metallicity relation for the satellites .",
    "by contrast , the ` cw ' model fails to reproduce this relation for the same reasons that it fails to reproduce the luminosity function : the constant mass - loading leads to an iron abundance in satellites with @xmath149 which is essentially independent of luminosity , contrary to what is observed .",
    "none of our ` vw ' models reproduces the oxygen - to - iron abundance ratio measured for dwarf satellites .",
    "there are several possible reasons for this discrepancy : the star formation timescale may be too long , the model of sne  ia or the imf that we have adopted may be incorrect , or our assumed oxygen yield may be too low . given the large uncertainties in the value of the yield , the imf and sne  ia rates , we do not consider this shortcoming of our models to be fatal although further work is required .",
    "for example , a top - heavy imf in these metal - poor objects could provide the solution although it is unclear whether such a radical assumption would destroy the agreement of the model with other observables .    based on our estimate of the minimum resolved circular velocity of subhaloes in the simulations , we find that subhaloes hosting satellites in the ` vw ' models are reliably resolved down to the faintest magnitude .",
    "thus , the faint - end slope of the satellite luminosity function and the luminosity - metallicity relation in the ` vw ' models are robust .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed by a direct convergence study of one model ( ` vw5@xmath2 ' of the aq - d ) : low- and high - resolution simulations give consistent results . on the other hand , in the ` cw ' models in which the smaller wind mass - loading factor allows satellites to form in halos with small values of @xmath70 , the faint - end slope of the satellite luminosity function",
    "could be affected by limited numerical resolution although we estimate that any such effects would be restricted to the extreme faint end .",
    "barring the alpha - to - iron ratio , we conclude that an energy - conserving wind model in which the mass loading scales inversely with square of velocity dispersion provides a viable model for feedback as judged by the properties of satellite galaxies .",
    "our preferred wind model is different from the ` momentum - driven ' wind models favoured by @xcite in order to explain the mass - metallicity relation of large galaxies . in this kind of model ,",
    "the wind speed is proportional to @xmath2 as in our ` vw ' models , but the mass - loading scales as @xmath150 ( rather than as @xmath113 ) .",
    "it could be that the mechanisms that drive galactic outflows in small and large galaxies are different .    in ` vw ' models with wind speed , @xmath151 ,",
    "the mass loading is large in small galaxies .",
    "winds therefore remove substantial amounts of star - forming gas , but much of this material eventually falls back onto the galaxy . as a result , the star formation in small satellites is episodic and has a much longer timescale than in the ` cw ' models in which the gas is expelled from the small halo , never to return .",
    "these general properties underlie the different predictions for the number density of faint galaxies and their chemical properties in the different models .",
    "the star formation histories of the satellites retain no obvious imprint of the reionization of gas at early times .",
    "accretion onto larger haloes , on the other hand , often affects subsequent star formation and , in low mass satellites ( @xmath152 ) , it truncates it altogether .",
    "only 5% of subhaloes whose circular velocities are higher than the minimum resolved value ( @xmath153 ) in the high - resolution simulation ( aq - d - hr ) host satellites .",
    "the vast majority of subhaloes do not manage to make a visible galaxy and remain dark .",
    "the mechanisms that distinguish visible from dark satellites are investigated in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to volker springel for providing us with the gadget-3 code and to joop schaye , claudio dalla vecchia , and rob wiersma for providing us with tabulated radiative cooling and heating rates .",
