    "these experiments exploit the interaction blockade inhibiting first - order tunneling processes . however , for the interaction blockade the spin fluctuations arising from superexchange are diminished due to the small amplitude .",
    "there is great current interest in accomplishing long - ranged anti - ferromagnetic ordering with ultracold fermions in optical lattices .",

    "the realization of fermionic high - spin systems with ultracold atoms promises a deeper understanding of fundamental spin - spin interactions @xcite .",

    "we find a regime dominated by superexchange with large amplitude and strong spin fluctuations in _ shallow _ potentials .",
    "usually , the observation of superexchange with ultracold quantum gases requires deep lattices with a large interaction gap @xmath2 that suppresses the first - order tunneling @xmath3 . in the latter regime ,",
    "the superexchange has small amplitudes @xmath4 and is therefore extremely sensitive to thermal fluctuations . in a high - spin system ,",
    "spin - changing collisions lift the pauli blocking of an initially prepared band - insulator state with @xmath5 .",
    "this causes the initial state to be unstable which in general allows strong particle - number fluctuations to arise @xcite .",

    "[ fig_fluctuations],scaledwidth=90.0% ]    in this paper we discuss the realization of a pure superexchange model with high - spin fermions .",
    "first , we introduce the corresponding superexchange as well as the full microscopic hamiltonian . in the subsequent sections ,",
    "we demonstrate that the superexchange hamiltonian @xmath16 can be realized with particles of spin @xmath17 in an optical lattice in a surprisingly wide range of parameters , including shallow lattices with large amplitudes @xmath4 . here , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) creates ( annihilates ) a particle on lattice site @xmath20 in the spin - state @xmath21 and obeys the fermionic commutation relations .",
    "the first part of this hamiltonian describes spin - changing collisions with an amplitude @xmath22 as depicted in figure [ fig_schemes](a ) .",
    "two particles on a lattice site exchange their spins while preserving the total magnetization , i.e. , @xmath23 . the second part of the hamiltonian represents superexchange processes ( figure [ fig_schemes](b ) ) .",
    "these second - order tunneling processes exchange particles on neighboring lattices sites , which preserves the density distribution but can lead to strong spin - fluctuations already in a double - well system .",
    "the corresponding amplitude @xmath4 accounts for the increased interaction energy @xmath2 in the virtually occupied intermediate state .",
    "the interaction energy itself is omitted in as a constant offset , since neither spin - changing collisions nor the superexchange affects the particle - number distribution .",
    "the first - order tunneling ( figure [ fig_schemes](c ) ) is not present in the hamiltonian and any intersite dynamics is mediated by superexchange processes .",
    "a system of fermionic particles with spin @xmath17 in an optical lattice can be used to realize the hamiltonian .",
    "the full microscopic description is given by the hamiltonian @xmath24 the number operator @xmath25 counts particles on a lattice site @xmath20 .",
    "in contrast to the superexchange hamiltonian , the full model allows for first - order tunneling @xmath26 , e.g. , @xmath27 ( figure [ fig_schemes](c ) ) and a corresponding change in onsite - interaction energy @xmath2 .",
    "the spin - changing collisions represent a small perturbation of the standard hubbard hamiltonian @xmath28 .",
    "we assume an amplitude of @xmath29 , which is a realistic value for @xmath1 ( see section [ sec_spin - dependent ] ) .    in this work , we investigate the dynamics of the band insulating ground state @xmath30 of the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath31 .",
    "the robust experimental preparation of this two - component band insulator as well as the control over the spin - changing collisions @xmath32 via a magnetic field has been demonstrated in reference @xcite . in the following",
    "we discuss the dynamics of in a double - well and a four - well plaquette potential .",
    "both setups can be realized experimentally @xcite and can be solved numerically exact .",
    "we show that the time evolution is governed by the superexchange model even in the absence of a direct interaction blockade .",
    "this effect depends on the existence of the fluctuationless eigenstate of the unperturbed hamiltonian in shallow lattices .",
    "note that there is no such eigenstate in bosonic systems where the realization of a pure superexchange model is only possible in deep lattices .",
    "by superimposing two optical lattices of a short wavelength @xmath33 and a longer wavelength @xmath34 an array of double - well potentials can be realized @xcite .",
    "the preparation of the initial state can be achieved by loading atoms with @xmath5 into the optical lattice of the short wavelength before ramping up the second lattice to separate the individual double - wells .",
    "the time evolution can be determined by means of exact diagonalization of the microscopic hamiltonian . for a wide range of parameters @xmath6",
    "we investigate the dynamics and evaluate the time - dependent particle - number fluctuations @xmath35 . in figure [ fig_fluctuations](a ) the time - averaged value of @xmath36 is shown as a function of @xmath6 ( solid black line ) and compared with the corresponding value of the ground state ( dashed line ) . for deep lattices , fluctuations are exponentially suppressed for decreasing @xmath6 due to an interaction blockade @xmath2 .",
    "surprisingly and in contrast to the ground state , we also find an exponential suppression of @xmath36 in shallow lattices for increasing @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , the time evolution of the band insulator is governed by the superexchange hamiltonian for almost all lattice depths .",
    "this phenomenon allows the simulation of the superexchange hamiltonian with ultracold atoms without an interaction blockade , i.e. , with large amplitudes @xmath4 .    in the case of vanishing tunneling @xmath37 , i.e. , in a very deep lattice , both sites undergo in - phase rabi oscillations induced by the spin - changing collisions ( figure [ fig_double - well](a ) ) .",
    "the state remains fluctuationless due to a large interaction blockade @xmath2 . after an evolution time of @xmath38",
    ", the state will eventually be the band - insulator @xmath39 . in both states ,",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath41 , no tunneling is possible due to the pauli principle . for all other times , however , the state is in a superposition of @xmath42 and @xmath43 on both wells . for a finite amplitude @xmath44",
    "first - order tunneling is in principle possible ( figure [ fig_schemes](c ) ) .",
    "surprisingly , the numerical results show very low occurrence of particle - number fluctuations @xmath36 even and especially for large values of @xmath6 .",
    "thus , the dynamics of is described by the superexchange operator .",
    "fig_double - well ] shows the time evolution for various parameters @xmath6 calculated with the full hamiltonian ( solid lines ) and with the superexchange hamiltonian ( dotted lines ) . only at values of @xmath45 , where @xmath36 has a maximum , finite deviations between the two models are present ( figure [ fig_double - well](b ) ) . in shallow lattices ,",
    "periodic oscillations with full amplitude are reestablished ( figure [ fig_double - well](c ) ) .",
    "superexchange processes take place on a short time - scale , leading to the population of onsite states with finite magnetization @xmath46 such as @xmath47 ( black lines in figure [ fig_double - well](b , c ) ) .",
    "this directly corresponds to a non - zero value of spin fluctuations @xmath48 , whereas particle - number fluctuations @xmath36 are negligible .",
    "in contrast , in deep lattices spin fluctuations remain small . here , @xmath11 is on the order of @xmath49 and thus the black line in figure [ fig_double - well](a ) is not visible .",
    "the time - averaged value of the spin fluctuations in the evolution of is shown as a blue line in figure [ fig_fluctuations](a ) .",
    "we can identify two distinct regimes : one with almost no spin fluctuations @xmath50 for small @xmath6 and one with large spin fluctuations @xmath51 for large @xmath6 .",
    "the crossover between the two distinct regimes discussed above is not a unique feature of the double - well but occurs also in other few - well systems . in the following",
    "we identify the underlying mechanism of the fluctuationless time - evolution in shallow potentials for the particular case of a four - well plaquette .",
    "this mechanism is , however , general for all few - well systems that show the discussed behavior .",
    "a four - well plaquette is the natural extension of a double - well potential in two dimensions .",
    "it is equivalent to a one - dimensional four - well lattice with periodic boundary conditions and has been recently realized experimentally @xcite . despite the increased complexity compared with the double - well , the hamiltonian can still be diagonalized for a four - well lattice allowing to investigate the time - evolution of the initially prepared band - insulator exactly .",
    "the hamiltonian has a number of symmetries that can be exploited to reduce the numerical effort .",
    "these symmetries are the spatial translation , spin - flip , quadrupole and particle - hole symmetry .",
    "furthermore , the initial state also obeys several symmetries and we can restrict the basis to the corresponding subspace .",
    "we investigate a wide range of parameters and find the two regimes with @xmath52 , known from the double - well .",
    "the spin fluctuations @xmath11 that arise from the initial state and the ground state properties of the system ( figure [ fig_fluctuations](b ) ) are very similar to the double - well system .",
    "in contrast to the results of the double - well , however , strong fluctuations appear at certain values of @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenspectra allow for a qualitative understanding of the two limits @xmath37 and @xmath53 and also explain the emerging resonances with high fluctuations @xmath36 .    in deep potentials",
    "@xmath37 , the onsite interaction @xmath2 is the dominating energy scale of the hamiltonian and the eigenstates separate in groups of fock states with integer @xmath2-excitations that are perturbed by @xmath26 and @xmath32 .",
    "the spectrum is shown in figure [ fig_plaquette](b ) , where each marker corresponds to an eigenstate @xmath54 with an energy @xmath55 and particle - number fluctuations @xmath36 .",
    "the latter directly correspond to the interaction energy @xmath56 @xmath57 red markers have finite overlap with the initial state , which is clearly confined to the group of eigenstates without fluctuations . here",
    ", the interaction blockade @xmath58 causes the dynamics to be determined by the superexchange hamiltonian , which is used in conventional realizations with ultracold atoms @xcite .",
    "the time - evolution of the initial state is shown in figure [ fig_plaquette](a ) , where the solid lines correspond to the full model and the dotted lines to the superexchange model .",
    "note that due to the very small amplitude of the superexchange @xmath4 spin fluctuations @xmath11 are suppressed and merely cause a slow dephasing of the onsite rabi oscillations .    in very shallow potentials ,",
    "the tunneling operator @xmath26 is the dominating energy scale of the hamiltonian .",
    "the spectrum for @xmath59 is shown in figure [ fig_plaquette](f ) . in a finite lattice",
    ", the spectrum is gaped due to the discrete energies of the bloch functions . in the case of four lattice sites and taking into account the conservation of momentum , the gap is @xmath60 .",
    "when this is large compared with @xmath2 and @xmath22 , the spectrum separates in groups with @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an integer number .",
    "the initial state obeys @xmath63 and @xmath64 and consequently lies in the group with @xmath65 . for @xmath66 , in this group the eigenenergies are given by the interaction energy @xmath67 , similar to the regime of the interaction blockade , as indicated by the dashed lines in the spectra .",
    "since the spin - changing collisions present only a small perturbation @xmath68 , the band isolator state is only perturbed by states with @xmath69 . for these states ,",
    "the particle - number fluctuations are small and the band isolator state can only develop small particle - number fluctuations .",
    "interestingly , a subordinate energy gap @xmath70 arises between fluctuationless states with @xmath69 ( including @xmath40 ) and states with particle - number fluctuations and an energy @xmath71 . due to the tunneling - energy gap",
    ", the interaction blockade is reestablished in sufficiently shallow potentials , where now @xmath22 is the competing energy scale instead of @xmath3 .",
    "the gap @xmath58 amplifies the suppression of particle - number fluctuations for the initial state , but is not a necessary requirement for @xmath72 .",
    "the surprisingly low fluctuations in very shallow potentials thus arise from a tunneling - energy gap @xmath73 and a subordinate interaction blockade . in figure [ fig_plaquette](e ) the time evolution for @xmath59",
    "is shown , where no deviations between the full model and the superexchange model can be seen .",
    "the time evolution of figure [ fig_plaquette](e ) in units of @xmath74 is identical for all lattice depths with @xmath75 and sufficiently small fluctuations @xmath36 ,",
    "i.e. , away from resonances in figure [ fig_fluctuations](b ) .    in the parameter regime @xmath76 ,",
    "neither an interaction blockade @xmath58 nor a tunneling - energy blockade @xmath73 inhibits particle - number fluctuations ( see figure [ fig_plaquette](d ) ) .",
    "the eigenenergies are not determined by the interaction energy only and thus do not directly correspond to the particle - number fluctuations .",
    "however , few eigenstates have finite overlap with the initial state and thus , only at specific parameters @xmath6 fluctuations arise . at these resonances ,",
    "the time evolution of the full model and the superexchange model differ significantly , as can be seen in figure [ fig_plaquette](c ) .",
    "the superexchange model ( dotted line ) predicts the same behavior as for very shallow potentials , whereas the correct calculations are strongly affected by the occurrence of triply occupied sites , which is plotted as a dashed blue line .",
    ", where the interaction - energy shifts have to be taken into account .",
    "( b ) the bias can be tuned to fulfill the resonance condition for certain particle - number distributions @xmath77 , allowing for the measurement of triply occupied wells ( blue line ) .",
    "[ fig_measure_triplons],scaledwidth=65.0% ]    an experimental proof of superexchange processes and the absence of first - order tunneling is the demonstration of strong spin fluctuations and vanishing particle - number fluctuations .",
    "the former can be accessed in an experiment with @xmath1 via the population of new spin components , as discussed in section [ sec_spin - dependent ] .",
    "the latter can be measured in an optical double - well setup with the technique illustrated in figure [ fig_measure_triplons](a ) .",
    "first , the lattice with the short wavelength @xmath33 is ramped up to freeze the populations . afterwards",
    ", the relative phase between the two lattice beams is tuned to introduce a bias @xmath78 between the wells . that way the third vibrational mode of the deeper well can be brought into resonance with the first one of the shallower well .",
    "the required bias @xmath79 between the left ( l ) and the right ( r ) well depends on the single - particle energies @xmath80 of the vibrational modes @xmath20 and the particle - number distribution @xmath77 that introduces interaction energy shifts .",
    "when a tunneling process occurs , the interaction energy on the left well is reduced by @xmath81 , while it is increased on the right well by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is given by the wave - function overlap of the lowest mode with the third one .",
    "this technique has already been successfully demonstrated in reference @xcite .",
    "for every given particle - number distribution we schematically plot the resonance of a transfer to the third band as a function of the applied bias @xmath78 in figure [ fig_measure_triplons](b ) .",
    "the blue line corresponds to the case of three particles in the left and one in the right well .",
    "we assume a width of @xmath84 for the resonances , which is a pessimistic assumption compared with the measured width in the experiment of reference @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig_measure_triplons](b ) shows that it is clearly possible to tune the bias to a value such that particles will be transferred to the third band only if there are exactly three particles on the shallower site .",
    "the population of the third mode can be measured by means of the band - mapping technique afterwards .",
    "as a concrete example , we now consider @xmath1 prepared in the @xmath85 manifold as a possible species for an experimental realization of high - amplitude superexchange . as the initial state",
    "we suggest a mixture of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which allows for rich spin - dynamics and is the most similar to a band insulator in a @xmath88 system . without tunneling , i.e. , in very deep lattices",
    ", rabi - oscillations between @xmath89 and @xmath90 occur in phase on every lattice site in analogy to the @xmath88 system .",
    "when tunneling is allowed , however , more complicated dynamics arise .",
    "consecutive to tunneling processes , new spin - components can be populated by other spin - changing collisions , e.g. @xmath91 .",
    "states with @xmath92 are only occupied by third - order processes and we neglect them in our simulations as their influence on the qualitative behavior is assumed to be small .",
    "this reduces the system effectively to 6 spin components .",
    "the spin fluctuations @xmath11 are no directly measurable quantity , however the population of the new spin components is proof for the occurrence of tunneling or superexchange processes .",
    "another difference compared with the spin-3/2 system is that the interaction energies @xmath2 and @xmath22 are no longer spin - independent but slightly differ from each other @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the microscopic hamiltonian to 6 spin components is straight forward , when the spin - dependent interaction energies are known . for our simulations we use parameters from @xcite . as a characteristic quantity for the potential depth",
    "we use the ratio @xmath93 , where the interaction energy @xmath94 corresponds to a spin - preserving collision in the initial state .",
    "the energy @xmath95 of the spin - changing collision @xmath96 is significantly smaller with @xmath97 .",
    "the quadratic zeeman - energy must be used to tune the spin - changing collisions into resonance , because the initial and final state of a spin - changing collision have different interaction energies . of course",
    ", this can not be done for all spin states at the same time and the exact time - behavior depends on the applied magnetic field .",
    "our simulations are performed with @xmath98 , but any other value near the resonance is suitable .    in figure [ fig_6_components](a , b )",
    "the time - behavior of the @xmath99-components is plotted for the double - well and the plaquette .",
    "they differ from the behavior of a @xmath88 system with spin - independent interaction energies in several ways . in the case of spin - dependent interactions",
    "the superexchange operator @xmath100 can be approximated by the matrix elements @xmath101 between an initial state @xmath102 and a final state @xmath103 with exactly two particles per lattice site , respectively .",
    "the sum is over all possible intermediate states @xmath104 and @xmath105 . for flat lattices ,",
    "the time - evolution can be described by this operator as can be seen by comparing the dotted lines with the solid lines in figure [ fig_6_components](a , b ) .",
    "the new spin - components @xmath106 and @xmath107 occur after a few milliseconds , which corresponds to an increase in spin fluctuations @xmath11 . in the plaquette",
    "the coherent rabi - oscillations are damped out rapidly in strong contrast to the spin-3/2 system , where they last for arbitrarily long times .",
    "the reason for this is the larger number of different frequencies due to the spin - dependency of the interaction strengths .    concerning the appearance of particle - number fluctuations @xmath36 , however , the qualitative behavior is identical to the spin-3/2 system , as shown in figure [ fig_6_components](c ) .",
    "the population of the components @xmath10 and @xmath108 ( dashed lines ) is proportional to the average spin fluctuations @xmath11 ( dotted lines ) .",
    "this is an intriguing advantage of the high spin @xmath109 as opposed to a pure spin-3/2 system . only for certain values of @xmath6 resonances with triply occupied sites",
    "occur , while for a wide regime of parameters , the state remains fluctuationless . due to the additional components , spin fluctuations increase to @xmath51 even in deep lattices for very long evolution times .",
    "the particle - number fluctuations , as discussed in section [ sec_measuren ] , as well as the population of the new spin - components are quantities that are accessible experimentally . in combination",
    "they are direct evidence for superexchange processes in the absence of direct tunneling . in conclusion",
    ", @xmath1 is a suitable atomic species for the proposed experiments to simulate superexchange hamiltonians in shallow lattices .",
    "we have found a mechanism for fermionic high - spin systems that allows for the investigation of superexchange processes in shallow lattices , i.e. , at large amplitudes @xmath4 .",
    "this regime corresponds to much faster time scales than in deep lattices and was not accessible yet .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics of an initially band - insulating state with two components has been calculated , and we found the intersite dynamics to be fully dominated by the superexchange .",
    "although , in general , spin - changing collisions circumvent pauli blocking and therefore allow for strong particle - number fluctuations in shallow lattices , we have shown that the first - order tunneling is strongly suppressed in few - well potentials while strong spin fluctuations arise via superexchange processes .",
    "the underlying mechanism is driven by an emerging tunneling - energy gap that reestablishes an interaction gap , which is usually only expected in deep lattices .",
    "furthermore , we have investigated the crossover of superexchange regimes with weak and strong spin fluctuations in deep and shallow lattices , respectively .",
    "we have discussed the experimentally relevant case of optical double - well and plaquette potentials .",
    "we have simulated the time evolution for a pure spin-3/2 system as well as for realistic parameters of @xmath1 and have shown that in both cases it is governed by the superexchange hamiltonian .",
