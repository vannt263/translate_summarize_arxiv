    "the study of traversable wormholes has received considerable attention from researchers for the past two decades .",
    "although lacking observational evidence , wormholes are just as good a prediction of the general theory of relativity as black holes . in particular , we refer to the pioneering work of visser @xcite , who proposed a theoretical method for constructing a new class of traversable lorentzian wormholes from black - hole spacetimes .",
    "this construction proceeds by surgically grafting two schwarzschild spacetimes together in such a way that no event horizon is permitted to form .",
    "the resulting structure is a wormhole spacetime in which the throat is a three - dimensional thin shell . in recent years",
    ", visser s approach was adopted by various authors for constructing thin - shell wormholes by similar methods , generally requiring spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "the approach is of special interest because it minimizes the amount of exotic matter required .",
    "all the exotic matter is confined to the shell .",
    "more recently , sur , das , and sengupta @xcite discovered a new black - hole solution for einstein - maxwell scalar field systems inspired by low - energy string theory .",
    "they considered a generalized action in which two scalar fields are minimally coupled to an einstein - hilbert - maxwell field in four dimensions , @xmath0,\\ ] ] where @xmath1 @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the curvature scalar , @xmath4 is the maxwell field tensor , while @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two massless scalar or pseudo scalar fields , which are coupled to the maxwell field .",
    "this coupling is described by the functions @xmath7 and @xmath8 . here",
    "@xmath9 acquires a non - minimal kinetic term @xmath10 . in the context of low - energy string theory ,",
    "fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 can be identified as massless scalar dilaton and pseudo scalar axion fields , respectively .    with the above action",
    "( 1 ) , sur , _ et al . _",
    ", @xcite found the most general class of black - hole solutions and obtained two types of metrics , classified as asymptotically flat and asymptotically non - flat .",
    "since we are interested in obtaining a thin - shell wormhole from this new black hole , we adopt the asymptotically flat metric given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 where , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the exponent @xmath16 is a dimensionless constant stricly greater than 0 and stricly less than 1 .",

    "in this paper we present a new kind of thin - shell wormhole by surgically grafting two charged black holes in generalized dilaton - axion gravity .",
    "the exotic matter required for its physical existence may possibly be collected from scalar fields that built the black holes .",
    "various aspects of this thin - shell wormhole are analyzed , particularly the equation of state relating pressure and density .",
    "also discussed is the attractive or repulsive nature of the wormhole , as well as the energy conditions on the shell .",
    "our final topic is a stability analysis to determine the conditions under which the wormhole is stable to linearized radial perturbations .",
    "a comparison to the stability of other thin - shell wormholes in the literature is also made .",
    "the mathematical construction of our thin - shell wormhole begins by taking two copies of the black hole and removing from each the four - dimensional region @xmath23 we now identify ( in the sense of topology ) the timelike hypersurfaces @xmath24 denoted by @xmath25 .",
    "the resulting manifold is geodesically complete and consists of two asymptotically flat regions connected by a throat .",

    "the lanczos equations now yield @xcite @xmath32 and @xmath33 to understand the dynamics of the wormhole , we assume the radius of the throat to be a function of proper time , or @xmath34 . also , overdot and prime denote , respectively , the derivatives with respect to @xmath27 and @xmath35 . for a static configuration of radius @xmath35 , we obtain the respective values of the surface energy density and the surface pressures . for a static configeration of radius @xmath35 ,",
