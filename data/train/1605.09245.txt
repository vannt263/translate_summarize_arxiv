    "<S> we report on doppler - free laser spectroscopy in a cs vapor cell using a dual - frequency laser system tuned on the cs d@xmath0 line . using counter - propagating beams with crossed linear polarizations , an original sign - reversal of the usual saturated absorption dip and large increase in doppler - free atomic absorption is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is explained by coherent population trapping ( cpt ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of laser intensity and light polarization on absorption profiles is reported in both single - frequency and dual - frequency regimes . in the latter , </S>",
    "<S> frequency stabilization of two diode lasers was performed , yielding a beat - note fractional frequency stability at the level of @xmath1 at 1 s averaging time . </S>",
    "<S> these performances are about an order of magnitude better than those obtained using a conventional single - frequency saturated absorption scheme .    in gas cell experiments , </S>",
    "<S> saturated absorption spectroscopy or doppler - free spectroscopy @xcite is an elegant technique to circumvent doppler broadening and to allow the detection of natural - linewidth resonance dips in the bottom of absorption profiles . </S>",
    "<S> this method , frequently used to stabilize the frequency of a laser to a particular atomic line , is applied in atomic frequency standards @xcite , magnetometers @xcite , laser - cooling experiments @xcite or atom interferometry . </S>",
    "<S> laser fractional frequency stability in the 10@xmath2@xmath310@xmath4 range at 1 s integration time can be obtained by combining saturated absorption techniques and narrow - linewidth diode lasers @xcite . in a common saturated absorption scheme , </S>",
    "<S> two counter - propagating laser beams of same frequency , a pump - beam and a probe beam , derived from a single laser beam , overlap one another in an atomic vapor cell . </S>",
    "<S> since both beams have the same frequency , the doppler effect brings different velocity groups into resonance with each beam . on resonance , </S>",
    "<S> only atoms presenting zero velocity along the light propagation axis actually experience the two beams with the same laser frequency . </S>",
    "<S> if the pump - beam intensity is high enough , the ground state is depleted and therefore the absorption of the probe beam is reduced compared to the case without pump beam . in this case , a so - called lamb dip , with lorentzian profile , appears at the resonance frequency of the atomic transition in the bottom of a gaussian doppler - broadened absorption profile . </S>",
    "<S> the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the doppler - free lamb dip can be at low laser intensity as small as the natural linewidth of the atomic transition ( 4.6 mhz for the cs d@xmath0 line ) . </S>",
    "<S> this process is relatively easy to understand in the case of a simple two - level atom with a single - frequency laser system . in real experience , </S>",
    "<S> alkali atoms exhibit a complex multi - level energy structure with hyperfine structure splitting and numerous zeeman sub - levels , especially in the cs case ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> such multi - level structures can lead , under appropriate conditions , to a sign reversal of saturation resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> + in the present article , we report on a doppler - free laser frequency stabilization setup on cs d@xmath0 line using a coherent bi - chromatic optical field . </S>",
    "<S> this setup was initiated in the frame of the development of a high - performance cs vapor cell atomic clock based on coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite . in many cs cpt clocks , including chip - scale atomic clocks @xcite , the laser is modulated at 4.6 ghz ( half of the cs atom clock frequency ) . in this configuration , </S>",
    "<S> both first - order optical sidebands induce the cpt process and the laser carrier frequency needs to be frequency - stabilized 4.6 ghz away from cs resonance transition . in csacs , </S>",
    "<S> the laser frequency is currently stabilized onto the bottom of a homogeneously broadened optical line detected in the buffer - gas filled cpt cell , leading to modest laser frequency stabilization . in a high - performance cpt clock @xcite , enhanced stabilization of the laser frequency </S>",
    "<S> is required . in that sense </S>",
    "<S> , we investigated the possibility to perform doppler - free spectroscopy in a cs vapor cell with a dual - frequency laser field . here </S>",
    "<S> , in this two - frequency configuration , two different transitions are involved in the saturated absorption scheme , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 are the hyperfine quantum numbers of the ground ( excited ) states , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> using counter - propagating beams with crossed linear polarizations , the detection of high - contrast natural - linewidth reversed dips is demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of polarization and laser intensity on absorption profiles is shown , supported by a qualitative theoretical approach . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the dual - frequency configuration allows to enhance greatly the dip - based frequency discriminator slope and the laser frequency stabilization compared to the usual single - frequency doppler - free spectroscopy . </S>",

    "<S> the power of the reflected beam is measured by a photodiode . </S>",

    "<S> + figure [ fig : spectres ] shows typical transmission signals detected by the photodiode ( pd in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the transition doublet @xmath6 and @xmath10 is shown . with parallel polarizations , </S>",
    "<S> the usual narrow lamb dip , with lorentzian profile , appears in the bottom of both doppler - broadened absorption gaussian - profile lines . </S>",
    "<S> with crossed polarizations , the dip is totally vanished in the bottom of the @xmath10 transition . in the dual - frequency regime , with crossed polarizations , a significant sign - reversal of the dip and large increase in doppler - free atomic absorption </S>",
    "<S> is observed , especially at high laser power . </S>",
    "<S> + the dip reversal can be explained by cpt effects which are cancelled for counter - propagating waves . </S>",
    "<S> we give here a simple qualitative explanation . a detailed theoretical investigation should take into account all the 25 involved zeeman sub - levels and can be only numerically computed .    , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively . ]    </S>",
    "<S> when a multilevel atom is irradiated by a wave connecting in a coherent way two sub - levels of the ground state to a same excited level , forming a @xmath14 scheme , the atom can be placed in a light - uncoupled linear superposition of both sub - levels . </S>",
    "<S> the atom no longer absorbs the light in this so - called dark state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a linearly polarized monochromatic wave propagating along the quantification @xmath15-axis is @xmath16 polarized . in null magnetic field and at optical resonance , a zeeman sub - level of the excited state @xmath17 will then be linked to two sub - levels of the ground state @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions allow the existence of a dark state that will disappear for increasing magnetic field , as soon as the zeeman splitting is larger than the cpt resonance linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> this effect is known as the non - linear hanle effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an example of full density matrix numerical calculation is reported in @xcite . according to the linear polarization along the @xmath20-axis or @xmath21-axis , </S>",
    "<S> the dark state is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the dipole moments of the involved transitions . </S>",
    "<S> equal field amplitudes are assumed . </S>",
    "<S> note that both dark states are orthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the atoms driven in a dark state by a polarized wave will absorb the perpendicularly polarized wave ( bright state ) .    </S>",
    "<S> consider now atoms of a gas irradiated by this wave and the reflected counterpropagating wave . at non - zero values of the optical detuning @xmath24 , because of the doppler shift , one travelling wave is resonant for atoms of the axial velocity class @xmath25 ( @xmath26 is the wave number ) while the reflected wave is resonant for atoms of the velocity class @xmath27 . in that way </S>",
    "<S> , a fraction of atoms interacting with only one of the two waves is trapped in a dark state whatever the polarization of the other wave . at optical resonance </S>",
    "<S> the atoms of velocity class @xmath28 are resonant for both counter - propagating waves . </S>",
    "<S> when the polarization of the two fields is the same , dark states are common , less atoms can absorb the probe wave and the expected saturated absorption dip is observed . </S>",
    "<S> according to ( [ eq : dsxy ] ) , when the polarization vectors are orthogonal , atoms in the dark states of the pump beam become bright and absorbing for the probe , and vice - versa . in this case , the absorption of both beams is increased and the lamb dip is reversed . a similar effect has already been investigated for linear and elliptical polarizations in the hanle configuration @xcite . in this study , </S>",
    "<S> the monochromatic laser was tuned at resonance and the probe beam power was recorded versus the magnetic field . in hanle configuration , </S>",
    "<S> the linewidth is limited by the cpt resonance width , inversely proportional to the zeeman coherence lifetime . in the present experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field is kept null . </S>",
    "<S> then , the sub - doppler resonance cancels when no more atoms interact with both waves simultaneously , i. e. when @xmath29 , with @xmath30 the linewidth of the optical transition . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that this cpt effect occurs when @xmath31 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it explains why we observe this phenomenon only on the ( @xmath10 ) transition ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : spectres ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> + the same effect occurs with a bichromatic beam carrying two optical frequencies frequency - split by the hyperfine - transition frequency . </S>",
    "<S> since the doppler - shift difference related to both frequencies is negligible in this case , hyperfine coherences between zeeman sub - levels of both hyperfine states are also built . </S>",
    "<S> the previous argument is still valid . if the pump and probe beams have the same linear polarization , dark states are dark for both beams and the saturated absorption dip is observed . </S>",
    "<S> if pump and probe beams are orthogonally polarized , dark states are no more identical . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at @xmath32 , assuming an optically thin medium and equal field amplitudes , the low - frequency @xmath33 component of pump beam ( @xmath34 polarized ) and high frequency @xmath35 component of probe beam ( @xmath36 polarized ) induce the dark states : @xmath37 where @xmath38 holds for @xmath39 , respectively , and @xmath40 for @xmath41 or @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> dark states of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : dshf ] ) are orthogonal . </S>",
    "<S> a higher absorption is expected at optical resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs for zeeman dark states and ( @xmath43 ) dark states , but not for ( @xmath44 ) dark states . in monochromatic and bichromatic cases , several state linear superpositions with @xmath45 , can coexist . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the atomic transit time across the beam is short , the steady - state is not reached and these dark states should be poorly populated . </S>",
    "<S> + in the case of crossed polarizations , we measured the evolution of the lorentzian dip versus the total laser power incident in the cell for both single - frequency and dual - frequency regimes . for each laser power , the absorption profiles of the cs d@xmath0 line spectrum are each fitted by the sum of a gaussian ( doppler broadened profile ) and a lorentzian function ( doppler - free dip ) . </S>",
    "<S> figures [ fig : fwhm - dip - p ] , [ fig : signal - dip - p ] and [ fig : slope - dip - p ] report the full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , height and height / fwhm ratio of the lorentzian dip signal detected in the bottom of the doppler - broadened profile versus the total laser power incident in the cell . </S>",
    "<S> we observe on fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fwhm - dip - p ] that the power broadening of the one - frequency dip is larger than in the two - frequency case . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously , the amplitude of the dip is dramatically increased in the dual - frequency case ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : signal - dip - p ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are attributed to optical pumping effects . in the single - frequency case , </S>",
    "<S> the atomic system is an open system , causing the atoms to be pumped into the other hyperfine ground state and leading to a higher effective saturation parameter @xcite . at the opposite , in the dual - frequency regime , </S>",
    "<S> the atomic system is closed , avoiding the loss of atoms . in the latter regime , </S>",
    "<S> a significant result is the important increase of the dip height with laser power , particularly for transitions connecting the ( @xmath46 ) excited level . on fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : slope - dip - p ] , we observe that the ratio signal / fwhm of the dip ( slope of the frequency discriminator for laser frequency stabilization ) is significantly increased in the dual - frequency regime . for a laser power of 500 @xmath9w , in the case of the transition to @xmath46 , </S>",
    "<S> the dip - based frequency discriminator slope is about an order of magnitude higher than in the single - frequency case . </S>",
    "<S> + laser frequency stabilization experiments were performed to compare single and dual - frequency regimes . for this purpose , two laser systems , named ls1 and ls2 , were implemented . </S>",
    "<S> both systems are mounted on distinct optical tables separated by about 2 meters and linked by an optical fiber . </S>",
    "<S> ls1 is similar to the system described in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : setup ] . </S>",
    "<S> ls2 uses a distributed bragg resonator ( dbr ) laser and a phase eom ( peom ) driven at 9.192 ghz . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> hyperfine cpt is induced by the carrier and one of the first - order sideband . </S>",
    "<S> the second first - order sideband is 9.192 ghz out of resonance and neglected here . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the gain on the frequency discriminator slope in the dual - frequency regime compared to the standard single frequency regime was found to be about the same for mz eom and peom - based setups . </S>",
    "<S> different tests were performed . in test 1 , each laser is in the free - running regime . in test 2 , ls1 operates in the dual - frequency stabilization regime ( dfsr ) whereas ls2 is in the single - frequency stabilization regime ( sfsr ) . </S>",
    "<S> for ls1 , the mz eom is driven at 4.6 ghz with carrier suppression . </S>",
    "<S> the laser direct output ( carrier ) is shifted 4.6 ghz away from cs resonance and the dual - frequency mz eom output beam is sent into the cell for laser stabilization . for ls2 , the peom microwave modulation is turned off and the peom output beam is sent into the cell for laser stabilization onto a cs transition . in test 3 , </S>",
    "<S> both laser systems operate in the dfsr . </S>",
    "<S> ls1 is configured as in test 2 and the peom of ls2 is driven at 9.192 ghz . in all tests , the single - frequency direct output of each laser ( before eoms ) </S>",
    "<S> is sent into a beam splitter cube . </S>",
    "<S> a laser beat - note at 4.596 ghz is detected by a fast photodiode , amplified and band - pass filtered . </S>",
    "<S> this signal is compared to a 4.621 ghz signal from a high - performance microwave synthesizer driven by a hydrogen maser . </S>",
    "<S> a final beat - note at 25 mhz is low - pass filtered and counted by a frequency counter ( hp 53132a ) . </S>",
    "<S> laser frequency is stabilized by modulating the laser injection current and demodulating it synchronously with a lock - in amplifier at the output of the photodiode . </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth of laser frequency servos is about 1 khz . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 reports the laser beat - note stability for each test .    </S>",
    "<S> w. ]    in the free - running regime , the laser beat - note fractional frequency stability is @xmath47 at 1 s averaging time . in test 2 where one of the laser is stabilized through a standard single - frequency saturated absorption scheme , </S>",
    "<S> results are similar to those reported in @xcite and improved at the level of @xmath48 at 1 s and @xmath49 at 100 s. in test 3 , where both lasers are stabilized through a dual - frequency doppler - free spectroscopy setup , the laser beat - note frequency stability is improved by almost 10 yielding @xmath1 at 1 s and @xmath50 at 1000 s. for a laser power of 500 @xmath9w , this improvement is in correct agreement with the increased frequency discriminator slope reported in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : slope - dip - p ] . </S>",
    "<S> the bump at 500 s on allan deviation plots is suspected to come from the room air conditioning cycle period . </S>",
    "<S> degradation of the frequency stability at higher time scales could be explained by temperature variations , fiber perturbations or laser amplitude variations along time . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion , we reported the detection of natural - linewidth and high - signal inverted resonance dips through doppler - free spectroscopy in a cs vapor cell using a dual - frequency laser system . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has demonstrated excellent laser frequency stabilization at the level of 10@xmath51 at 1 s and 100 s integration time for a single laser , a gain of an order of magnitude compared to performances obtained with a conventional single - frequency laser system in similar conditions . </S>",
    "<S> this system can be used in various applications including cpt atomic clocks , laser spectroscopy , non - linear optics and laser - cooling experiments . </S>"
