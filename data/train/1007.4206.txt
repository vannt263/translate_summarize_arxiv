    "custodial symmetry  @xcite is a natural ingredient in models of strong electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) fields can be partly composite in these models  @xcite , i.e. an admixture of elementary and composite states , acquiring a mass from their composite components .",
    "thus , heavier fields are naturally more composite , and also have a sizable mixing with composite states of the strong sector with the same sm quantum numbers .",
    "these composite states come , however , in full multiplets of the custodial symmetry , the custodians , which can be relatively light and couple strongly to the partly composite sm field .",
    "then , it is natural to expect , for instance , new light fermionic resonances with a large mixing with the top  @xcite .    the leptonic sector can be similarly realized with an extra global symmetry implying tri - bimaximal mixing  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the tau can be more composite than naively expected from its mass .",
    "tau custodians , the custodial symmetry partners of the composite state mixing with the elementary tau , can then be relatively light , coupling sizably only to the tau  @xcite .",
    "moreover , these new resonances do not disturb the very precisely measured properties of the tau lepton because its coupling to the @xmath2 boson is protected by a subgroup of the custodial symmetry  @xcite .   coupling  @xcite . ]    in this letter we investigate the lhc reach for such new leptonic resonances",
    ". they can be pair produced with electroweak ( ew ) strength through the exchange of a sm gauge boson , decaying almost exclusively into taus and a vector or scalar sm boson .",
    "this analysis is crucial because signatures with taus in the final state are typically deemed challenging and therefore not the first choice for new physics searches .",
    "such a signature could however very well be the first hint , and maybe the only one for a while , of the explicit realization of the lepton spectrum in models of strong ewsb .",
    "pair production of these new resonances with the taus subsequently decaying into leptons appears to be the cleanest , model independent channel for these searches .",
    "assuming collinearity and no other source of missing energy we can fully reconstruct the two taus .",
    "equality of the invariant mass of the two reconstructed new leptons then allows to reduce the background and reconstruct the custodian masses .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we review the main features and signatures at the lhc of the tau custodians in section  [ taucustodians : sec ] .",
    "the details of the analysis and the results are given in section  [ analysis : sec ] and our conclusions in section  [ conclusions : sec ] .",
    "the simplest realization of tau custodians with a protected @xmath3 coupling consists of two vector - like lepton doublets with hypercharges @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the script @xmath7 indicates the current basis .",
    "the relevant part of the yukawa and mass lagrangian reads , in the basis with diagonal charged lepton yukawa couplings , @xmath8 \\tau^{(0)}_r   - m \\big [ \\bar{l}^{(0)}_{1l } l^{(0)}_{1r}+ \\bar{l}^{(0)}_{2l }    l^{(0)}_{2r } \\big]+\\mathrm{h.c . }",
    "+ \\ldots,\\ ] ] where the dots denote kinetic terms and other terms in the lagrangian not involving the new leptons .",
    "@xmath9 is the sm higgs doublet and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the second pauli matrix , @xmath12 gev is the higgs vev , and @xmath13 are the third generation sm leptons . in the class of models we consider ,",
    "the coupling to @xmath14 , @xmath15 or any right - handed neutrino is negligible .",
    "after ewsb , the lepton mass matrix @xmath16 is diagonalized with the usual bi - unitary rotations , @xmath17 , which in our case take the very simple form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "all relevant physics can be parameterized in terms of @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . however , it is simpler to use as alternative parameters @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath23 , where the latter two fully describe the model , with the left - handed mixing parameter @xmath26 in particular , assuming @xmath27 gev we have @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "( thus @xmath30 , @xmath31 is an excellent approximation . )",
    "the resulting physical spectrum consists of three degenerate leptons with mass @xmath23 and charges @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively @xmath35 and a heavier charge @xmath33 lepton with mass @xmath36    in the physical basis the lepton couplings to the sm gauge bosons and to the higgs can be written without loss of generality @xmath37 \\psi^j_q z_\\mu , \\\\ \\mathcal{l}^w&= & \\frac{g}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\bar{\\psi}^i_q \\gamma^\\mu \\big [ v^{ql}_{ij } p_l + v^{qr}_{ij } p_r \\big ] \\psi^j_{(q-1 ) } w^+_\\mu + \\mathrm{h.c . } , \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{l}^h&= & -\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\bar{\\psi}^i_q y^{q}_{ij } p_r \\psi^j_q + \\mathrm{h.c.},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 runs over the electric charges in the spectrum ( @xmath39 ) and @xmath40 are the chirality projectors . in our case ,",
    "the neutral gauge couplings read @xmath41 and the charged ones @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the corresponding entry of the pmns matrix  @xcite .",
    "finally , the corresponding yukawa couplings read @xmath44 an explicit example , including numerical values for these couplings in the context of composite higgs models , can be found in  @xcite .",
    "note that ew single production of these states in association with a tau lepton is proportional to @xmath30 or @xmath25 , and therefore very sensitive to the particular value of the latter .",
    "pair production , on the other hand , is proportional to the electric charge , to @xmath31 or to @xmath45 , and then less sensitive to the precise value of @xmath25 unless @xmath46 .",
    "the three leptons with mass @xmath23 always decay into a tau lepton and a sm gauge boson @xmath47 whereas the heavier one always decays to a tau and a higgs @xmath48 provided @xmath49 . for smaller @xmath45 values the corresponding decay channels into another heavy lepton and a gauge or higgs boson open up .",
    "this is an exciting possibility , since it allows for a richer phenomenology but requires a large mixing ( for instance , @xmath50 for @xmath51 gev ) . mixing angles",
    "that large require a detailed analysis of indirect constraints to assess the phenomenological viability of the model and we defer it to a future publication .",
    "hence , we restrict ourselves to the case in which all new leptons only decay to tau leptons and a sm scalar or vector boson .    new leptons can be singly produced in association with a tau or pair produced at the lhc .",
    "single production , which may be relevant for the early lhc run @xmath52 1 fb@xmath1 at @xmath53 tev , is very sensitive to the values of the couplings in the model , as just stressed .",
    "the relatively light masses and large couplings that can be tested in this early run not only require an analysis of current ew constraints but a dedicated study of the lhc reach , which will be presented elsewhere .",
    "pair production , on the other hand , is ew and model independent to a large extent . the two heavy leptons then decay into two taus and two sm bosons , which in turn will result in ten fermions in the final state .",
    "we are in the best position to beat the background if we consider fully leptonic tau decays . besides , we will require a @xmath2 in the final state decaying into leptons for the same reason .",
    "due to the relatively large mass of the heavy leptons , the two taus are largely boosted and therefore their decay products highly collimated . assuming full collimation , we can completely reconstruct the two taus despite having four neutrinos in the final state if there is no further source of missing energy .",
    "thus , we consider the following channels @xmath54 together with the conjugated ones .",
    "the signature we are interested in is therefore @xmath55 even though we have to pay an important price due to the leptonic branching ratios @xmath56 [ @xmath57 , @xmath58 , the dramatic reduction of backgrounds overcomes this signal suppression .",
    "besides the multilepton final state , the full reconstruction of the taus decaying leptonically and that the pair produced heavy leptons have the same mass allows us to further reduce the background down to an almost unobservable level .",
    "as explained in the previous section , we consider pair production of tau custodians for it is model independent .",
    "the corresponding branching ratios , together with the energy required to produce two heavy states makes the cross section too small to have a significant number of events in the early lhc run .",
    "we thus concentrate on the nominal energy @xmath0 tev .",
    "the backgrounds we have considered are @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the corresponding cross sections .",
    "one @xmath2 in all channels and both tops in the @xmath61 channel have been required to decay leptonically and the cross section reported includes the corresponding branching ratios and some minimal cuts . in all cases",
    "we have generated up to @xmath62 jets at the partonic level with alpgen v2.13  @xcite , and used the pgs4  @xcite fast deterctor simulation after passing the events through pythia  @xcite for hadronization and showering ( with the mlm matching algorithm ) .",
    "our signal events are generated with madgraph / madevent v4  @xcite and taus are decayed with tauola  @xcite . in all cases",
    "we have included initial and final state radiation but no pile - up effects .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : xsecsr01 ] the signal production cross section , including the @xmath2 leptonic branching ratio but not decaying the tau leptons , as a function of the heavy mass @xmath23 ( and assuming a higgs mass @xmath63 gev ) .    .",
    "the dotted ( solid ) line corresponds to @xmath64 tev .",
    "the cross section includes the leptonic @xmath2 decay but not the tau decays , i.e. @xmath65 .",
    "[ fig : xsecsr01 ] , scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in order to reduce the background we have implemented the following cuts    * * basic cuts*. we require at least two positively and two negatively charged isolated leptons ( electrons or muons ) , two jets and missing energy with @xmath66 we keep the hardest four leptons and two jets if their multiplicity is larger . * * leptons*. we require two same flavour , opposite charge leptons to reconstruct a @xmath2 , and the other two not to be back to back ( so that the two taus can be reconstructed assuming collinearity ) , @xmath67 * @xmath68 .",
    "the two jets in our signal come from the decay of a sm boson .",
    "we therefore impose a cut on the invariant mass of the two jets @xmath69 * * @xmath70 reconstruction*. we use the two leptons not reconstructing the @xmath2 and the transverse missing energy to infer the tau four - momenta  @xcite .",
    "first , we assume all momenta in the tau decays are aligned @xmath71 where @xmath72 stands for the spatial components @xmath73 and @xmath74 denotes the sum of the momenta of the neutrinos coming from the @xmath75 decay .",
    "@xmath76 are the fraction of @xmath75 momentum taken by @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "they are fixed by momentum conservation in the transverse plane @xmath78 these lie between 0 and 1 if all transverse missing energy , measured with infinite precision , comes from collinear tau decays .",
    "thus , we require @xmath79 and use them to reconstruct the @xmath75 four - momenta @xmath80 * * pair production*. we require the two reconstructed heavy leptons to have the same mass within 50 gev , @xmath81 where @xmath82 corresponds to the invariant mass of @xmath75 and either @xmath83 or @xmath84 .",
    "( we select the pairing giving the smaller difference . ) * * mass reconstruction*. finally we require the invariant mass of the @xmath85 pairing to peak around a test mass within 50 gev . @xmath86    we have applied the analysis described above to the signal , for different values of the custodian mass @xmath23 , and to the background . in order to estimate the statistical significance of the result we use @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the number of signal and background events , respectively , after all cuts have been imposed  @xcite .",
    "we require a minimum number of 3 signal events and @xmath90 for a @xmath91 discovery .",
    "an example of the efficiency of each cut on the signal and on the main backgrounds for two sample custodian masses @xmath92 gev and @xmath93 gev is shown in table  [ tab : cuts ] .",

    "new light leptonic resonances related to the tau lepton through custodial symmetry , tau custodians , can be a natural occurrence in models of strong ewsb , if a global symmetry governs the lepton spectrum .",
    "thanks to the custodial symmetry , they can be light and strongly coupled to the tau without conflict with ew precision or flavour data .",
    "pair production of tau custodians provides a clean , model independent channel , that results in two taus and two gauge or higgs bosons .",
    "requiring at least one @xmath2 decaying into electrons or muons , leptonic tau decays and no further source of missing energy , we end up with a final state with four charged leptons ( electrons or muons ) , missing energy and two jets .",
    "the large number of leptons allows for a very efficient reduction of the main backgrounds .",
    "the relative large mass of the custodians results in highly boosted taus with very collimated decay products .",
    "assuming complete collimation , we can fully reconstruct both taus , despite the presence of four neutrinos in the final state .",

    "this analysis is crucial in the context of models of strong ewsb due to the difficulty of observing pair production of tau custodians because they only decay into taus , and this could be the very first experimental signature of the explicit realization of the lepton spectrum in these models .",

    "a rough estimate indicates that they could give a similar sensitivity .",
