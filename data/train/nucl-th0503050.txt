    "<S> we investigate the properties of @xmath0he , @xmath1he , @xmath2he , @xmath3li and @xmath4o nuclei in nuclear matter of finite temperature and density . </S>",
    "<S> a dyson expansion of the many - body green function leads to few - body equations that are solved using the integro - differential equation approach ( idea ) and the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) methods . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the latter method allows us to trace the individual movement of the wave packet for each nucleon and the formation and disintegration of quasi - nuclei in a changing thermodynamical nuclear matter environment .    </S>",

    "<S> one particular interesting example is the liquid gas phase transition usually related to multi - fragmentation into light nuclei  @xcite . for more and other experiments </S>",
    "<S> see e.g.  @xcite . in practical calculations of heavy ion collisions  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , formation of clusters is described by kinematical ( or geometrical ) constraints that allow certain nucleons to combine to larger clusters or larger clusters to disintegrate . in some simulations these constraints </S>",
    "<S> are supplemented by a probability to occur that is either related to some fit parameter or in more microscopic approaches to the nucleon nucleon cross section . depending on the specific approach , e.g. statistical multi - fragmentation models  @xcite , microscopic transport models such as boltzmann type  @xcite , quantum molecular dynamics  @xcite , or recent more intermediate type of event generators  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the algorithms that deal with fragmentation are rather educated and powerful . despite the decisive role of fragmentation , </S>",
    "<S> the exact conditions under which fragments are formed and which properties they have in such an excited nuclear many - body system are little known . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , even for a particular heavy ion collision at a given energy the formation of fragments could be at different stages under quite different conditions .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameters that are introduced into the simulation to accommodate fragmentation might be calculated microscopically . to motivate the objective of our present work we remind the reader how the conditions of deuteron formation are achieved in a microscopic statistical description of heavy ion collisions such as the boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) approach . to this end </S>",
    "<S> an overlap integral is introduced that cuts momentum components and hence geometrically describes the effect of pauli blocking . to be more specific , formation of deuterons </S>",
    "<S> is only allowed if  @xcite @xmath5 holds , where @xmath6 denotes the c.m . </S>",
    "<S> momentum of the cluster and @xmath7 the relative momentum of the nucleons inside the wave function @xmath8 of the deuteron . </S>",
    "<S> the pauli blocking is achieved by the nucleon momentum distribution function @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the cut - off @xmath10 is a parameter that needs to be fixed . </S>",
    "<S> originally it has been treated as a fit parameter with a typical value of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that it is possible to connect this parameter to a microscopic calculation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> using in - medium deuteron wave functions leads to @xmath12 not quite the value used to fit to experiments . </S>",
    "<S> it could be that the higher value of @xmath13 simulates also evaporation from larger clusters that is not present in the microscopic approach used in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical interpretation of ( [ eqn : cut ] ) is due to the mott transition that occurs when the binding energy of the cluster vanishes because of medium effects . for an early paper on a microscopic calculation of the deuteron s mott transition see @xcite . in the present work </S>",
    "<S> we proceed further along the pathway of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite investigating the mott transition for larger clusters up to @xmath4o using rigorous few - body equations that include the dominant medium effect , i.e. self energy corrections and pauli blocking . </S>",
    "<S> this also extends previous investigations on the behavior of the nucleon deuteron reaction  @xcite , the @xmath0he/@xmath0h  @xcite and the @xmath14-particle  @xcite along this lines . </S>",
    "<S> these investigations were based on the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) equations @xcite which were modified to include the effects of the medium .    because of the pauli blocking the effective interaction between nucleons becomes energy ( @xmath15 ) dependent . to be specific we choose a temperature of @xmath16 mev that is characteristic for heavy ion collisions and also relevant for neutron stars . in the present work we first endeavor to transform the @xmath15-dependent nucleon - nucleon interaction to an @xmath15-independent one using the marchenko inverse scattering method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this paves the way to go beyond three- and four - nucleon systems described by integral equations in momentum space by using configuration space formalisms . </S>",
    "<S> we employ here two such formalisms , namely the idea @xcite and the amd @xcite methods . </S>",
    "<S> the former method is based on the assumption that the dominant correlations in the medium are still of two - body nature and thus one can obtain faddeev - type equations for the corresponding two - body amplitudes . the amd method , on the other hand , enable us to study changes in the density of the clusters embedded in the medium and obtain expectation values @xmath17 for the center of the wave packets for each nucleon within the cluster . in our studies </S>",
    "<S> we consider , the @xmath0he , @xmath1he , @xmath2he , @xmath3li and the @xmath4o nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> the dyson expansion of the many - body green function is used to obtain thermodynamic cluster green functions for the @xmath18-nucleon system embedded in nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster green functions are evaluated for an uncorrelated medium . </S>",
    "<S> hence , they can be formulated as resolvents and respective resolvent equation can be derived for @xmath18 quasi - nucleons that can be tackled with few - body techniques , however , modified effective potentials and self energies ( masses ) . at a two body level </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the well known @xmath19-matrix equation  @xcite , @xmath20 with @xmath21.the corresponding schrdinger - type equation is @xmath22 the @xmath23 is the fermi function given by @xmath24 with @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used an effective mass approximation , i.e. the quasi - particle energy @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 the constant shift @xmath28 can be absorbed in a redefinition of the chemical potential @xmath29 . for simplicity </S>",
    "<S> we take the effective masses used in previous calculations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the two - body system is at rest in the medium , then the kinetic energy term ( [ h0 ] ) is written as @xmath30 while the effective interaction that appears in ( [ t2 ] ) and ( [ h0 ] ) is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the two - body center of mass energy . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 denotes the continuum edge as explained , e.g. , in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    to transform this potential to an equivalent @xmath15-independent one </S>",
    "<S> , we employed the marchenko inverse scattering method @xcite which does not require to choose _ a priori _ the shape and range of the potential . </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger equation is transformed to an integral one for the non - local function @xmath34 , @xmath35 where the kernel @xmath36 is given by the fourier transform of the @xmath37-matrix , @xmath38h^{(+)}_\\ell(kr ' )        { \\rm d}k \\\\        & + & \\sum_{n=1}^{n_b }       a_{n \\ell}h^{(+)}_\\ell(b_n r)h^{(+)}_\\ell(b_n r')\\ . \\label{frr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equation , @xmath39 is the riccati - hankel function and @xmath40 are the asymptotic normalization constants for the bound states @xmath41 . the solution of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ march ] ) can then provide us the underlying local @xmath15-independent interaction @xmath42 . @xmath43 </S>",
    "<S> more details and practical aspects of the method can be found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we only stress here that the marchenko equation is fully equivalent to the schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> however , while in the latter equation one uses the knowledge of the potential from which the physical information of the underlying system can be extracted via the wave - function , in the marchenko equation the information at hand is the scattering and bound state data embedded in the @xmath37-matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> an efficient way to study systems with @xmath44 is to employ the idea method to the @xmath18-body . </S>",
    "<S> the method is based on hyperspherical harmonics and the @xmath18-body wave function , due to pairwise acting forces , can be written as a sum of faddeev - type amplitudes for the pairs @xmath45 , @xmath46}({\\bf x } ) \\sum_{i < j\\le a }     f({\\bf r}_{ij},r ) , \\label{psiex}\\ ] ] where @xmath47}({\\bf x})$ ] is a harmonic polynomial of minimal degree @xmath48 and @xmath49 is the hyper - radius @xmath50 . using ( [ psiex ] ) one obtains the faddeev - type equation for the amplitude @xmath51 @xmath52}({\\bf x})f({\\bf r}_{ij},r)=-v(r_{ij } )          h_{[l_m]}({\\bf x } )   \\sum_{k < l\\le a}f({\\bf r}_{kl},r ) . \\label{fana}\\ ] ] this equation may be modified by introducing in both sides the average of the potential over the unit hypersphere , _ </S>",

    "<S> in contrast to the idea which is based on the faddeev decomposition of the wave function , in the amd method @xcite one assumes that the antisymmetrized wave function for the a - nucleons is given by a slater determinant @xmath58 \\label{wfa}\\ ] ] constructed from the the @xmath59-th nucleon wave function @xmath60\\,|\\chi_i\\rangle\\,.\\ ] ] in the above equations @xmath61 is the parity projection operator , @xmath62 is a set of ( complex ) parameters parameterizing the nucleon , @xmath63 , @xmath64 is a width parameter for the wave packet and @xmath65 is the spin - isospin function for the nucleon @xmath59 . to obtain the solution </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath14 particle acts as an attractive center for the two neutrons forming a halo nucleus which are escaping with increasing @xmath78 . in the case where only a wigner force is considered , the two neutrons are escaping in either side of the @xmath14 particle . </S>",
    "<S> however , the inclusion of spin - isospin component in the nuclear force generates two sub - clusters consisting of an @xmath14 cluster and the two neutrons which tend to split first prior an overall disintegration occurs . </S>",
    "<S> these differences are best seen on the two  dimensional fig . </S>",

    "<S> our conclusions can be summarized as follows . </S>",
    "<S> i ) the dynamical behavior of a nucleonic cluster in a medium can be reliably studied using a combination of methods namely , a cluster mean field approximation of the dyson green function expansion , an inverse scattering method for transforming the @xmath15-dependent potential to an @xmath15-independent one and few - body methods . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) the construction of the @xmath15-independent interactions paves the way to study the behaviour of light nuclei ( a@xmath953 - 20 ) in a medium using configuration space formalisms . </S>",
    "<S> iii ) the use of the amd method allows us to trace the individual movement of the nucleonic wave packet and the formation of sub - clusters when the density increases . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is particularly suited to explore correlations as has been done , e.g. , for light clusters in a recent experiment  @xcite , and also get insight into a possible evaporation mechanism of light clusters . </S>",
    "<S> iv ) the use of wigner forces alone seems to be insufficient for a proper description of the clusters while the inclusion of the majorana force generated dramatic changes in the clustering picture of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> however , in order to obtain a complete picture on the behavior of quasi - nuclei in a changing nuclear matter environment , more realistic forces that include also the bartlett and heisenberg components as well as an ls - force should be employed . </S>",
    "<S> although the effects of the former two components are expected to be small , the role played by the latter force in these extremely loose bound systems could be quite important and therefore its inclusion in studies concerning disintegration of clusters is warranted . </S>"
