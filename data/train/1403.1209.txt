    "for one - dimensional ( 1-d ) strongly correlated quantum systems , the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite and matrix product states ( mps ) in general @xcite have emerged as a powerful tool for the calculation of ground state and excited state properties . since its invention , the dmrg has been extended to treat dynamical correlation functions @xcite as well as real time evolution @xcite , and nowadays is considered the method of choice for tackling 1-d quantum systems .    regarding spectral functions , the first attempt with dmrg involved a continued fraction expansion @xcite .",
    "this method failed however to produce reliable results for large systems .",
    "a major improvement was the introduction of the correction vector ( cv ) method @xcite and its variational dynamical dmrg ( ddmrg ) formulation @xcite .",
    "both methods are known to give highly accurate spectral functions for 1-d systems .",
    "they suffer however from two major drawbacks : first , one has to invert a large , non - hermitian and possibly ill - conditioned system of equations in a dmrg - like fashion , and second , one has to do full dmrg - like calculations for every single @xmath2 value . a similar approach has also been proposed in @xcite , where the cv method was used as an impurity solver within dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite for a multi - orbital system .",
    "more recently , the continued fraction expansion has been combined with an mps parametrization of the krylov vectors @xcite , yielding decreased computational cost as compared to the ddmrg @xcite method while giving results of comparable accuracy .",
    "in other recent work @xcite , mps methods were combined with the chebyshev expansion technique of the kernel polynomial method ( kpm ) @xcite to obtain highly accurate spectral functions for the isotropic heisenberg model .    in the present paper , we propose to extend the kpm by postprocessing computed chebyshev moments with linear prediction , which drastically improves the spectral resolution while the chebyshev moments are accessible with far lower computational effort compared to ddmrg @xcite .",
    "we also extend the approach to treat interacting quantum impurity problems and implement a dmft self - consistency cycle with the improved kpm as an impurity solver .",
    "our approach avoids the simultaneous targeting of ground state and excited - state necessary in ddmrg , which may be especially important for multi - orbital impurity solvers . for the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) @xcite",
    ", we obtain accurate results over a broad parameter range . for the dmft ,",
    "our results show a sharp peak within the hubbard bands of the hubbard model in the vicinity of the mott - hubbard transition .",
    "we also introduce an expansion in powers of @xmath0 instead of @xmath1 , which completely avoids an energy truncation necessary in the original kpm method and leads to improved stability . in general , the advantages of the proposed chebyshev expansion of mps are : ( i ) the spectral function can be calculated directly for real frequencies , also at zero temperature ; ( ii ) the flexibility to arbitrarily discretize the hybridization function allows for good energy resolution at all frequencies , and results as precise as ddmrg ; ( iii ) the method is applicable not only to impurity models , but to any 1-d model with short - range interactions .",
    "the kernel polynomial method @xcite is a numerical method for expanding greens functions @xmath3 and spectral functions @xmath4 of many - body quantum systems in orthogonal chebyshev polynomials @xmath5 . to make this document self contained , we will in the following",
    "describe the basic properties of the kpm . in the mathematical literature ,",
    "two types of chebyshev polynomials are used : those of first and those of second kind . for the spectral function , we will only need those of the first kind which will be called chebyshev polynomials henceforth .    for a quantum system with hamiltonian @xmath1 at temperature @xmath6 , the spectral function for the unoccupied part ( @xmath7 ) and occupied part ( @xmath8 ) of the spectrum has the form @xmath9 where we shifted the ( non - degenerate ) ground state @xmath10 to zero energy ; @xmath11 and @xmath12 are bosonic or fermionic annihilation and creation operators , respectively .",
    "the chebyshev expansion converges only in the interval @xmath13 $ ] , since the chebyshev polynomials @xmath14 are unbounded as a function of their order @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "the hamiltonian therefore has to be rescaled by some factor @xmath17 , such that the single particle excitation energies are moved into the interval @xmath13 $ ] , @xmath18 henceforth , we assume that @xmath1 has been rescaled to @xmath19 ( see also sections [ sec : implementation ] and [ sec : exp_tau ] ) .    by inserting a representation of the dirac delta function in terms of the orthogonal chebyshev polynomials @xmath20 into eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectral_function ] ) , one arrives at @xmath21 the method amounts to computing the expectation values @xmath22 of the @xmath15-th chebyshev polynomial . for many - body systems",
    ", this is of course a highly non - trivial task .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials satisfy the recursion relation @xmath23 the computation of @xmath24 can therefore be performed through a corresponding recursion relation for the many - body quantum states @xmath25",
    "if @xmath19 has been properly rescaled , then this recursion relation will converge .",
    "the product relations of the chebyshev polynomials allow the moments @xmath26 and @xmath27 to be calculated already from the states @xmath28 and @xmath29 using @xcite @xmath30 if not stated otherwise , results in this paper were obtained from these reconstructed moments .",
    "the above procedure requires only the ability of applying an operator @xmath19 to a state @xmath31 and of computing overlaps of the resulting states with @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "the moments for the occupied part of the spectrum ( @xmath34 ) can be generated by changing @xmath35 to @xmath11 in the first line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : recurr ] ) . the full spectral function @xmath36 is obtained by combining @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and using @xmath39 : @xmath40 + 2\\sum_n[\\mu_n^++(-1)^n\\mu_n^-]t_n(\\omega)\\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{1-\\omega^2}}\\left(\\mu_0 + 2\\sum_n\\mu_n t_n(\\omega)\\right)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "note that the decay of the positive ( negative ) moments @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) with @xmath15 is qualitatively different from that of @xmath44 : the spectral function @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) has a step at the fermi - energy @xmath45 , which corresponds to an _ algebraic _ decay of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) @xcite of order 1 ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the added moments @xmath44 on the other hand corresponds to a smooth analytic spectral function for which the moments converge much faster ( exponentially ) to zero @xcite .",
    "the recursion relation given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : recurr ] ) can be implemented straightforwardly in an mps framework @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", the hamiltonian @xmath19 is brought into a matrix product operator ( mpo ) form @xcite , formally similar to the mps representation of a quantum state .",
    "the auxiliary dimension @xmath47 of the corresponding mpo - matrices is typically between 4 and 6 . in general , the application of an mpo of bond dimension @xmath47 to an mps of bond dimension @xmath48 ( denoted @xmath49 in the following ) leads to an mps with increased bond dimension @xmath50 . to make successive applications like in eq .",
    "( [ eq : recurr ] ) feasible , the state is then _ compressed _ by a variational procedure @xcite back to bond dimension @xmath48 .",
    "this is the same procedure as done in standard dmrg calculations .",
    "the corresponding systematic error is quantified by the fidelity @xmath51 which measures the relative distance of the compressed and original state , and can be estimated by the truncated weight , which is the sum of the discarded eigenvalues of the density matrix @xcite .",
    "when @xmath19 has not been rescaled over the full bandwidth of @xmath1 , compression reintroduces modes with energies outside the convergence interval ( @xmath52 ) , which would result in a rapidly diverging recurrence . to overcome this divergence",
    ", an energy - truncation scheme has to be used to project out such high energy modes , at the cost of introducing a new systematic error and extra computational effort . in section [ sec : exp_tau ] we present a generalization of the kpm method without any need for energy truncation .",
    "energy truncation is done similar to a dmrg run @xcite by sweeping back and forth ( @xmath53 times each ) through the system . at each site ,",
    "high energy modes are projected out by applying a projection operator .",
    "it is obtained by a lanczos tri - diagonalization , which yields a set of approximate eigenenergies @xmath54 and eigenstates @xmath55 .",
    "the projection operator @xmath56 projecting out modes with @xmath57 is then given by @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is the number of steps in the lanczos procedure . for a detailed study on the effect of the @xmath59 on the accuracy of the moments @xmath60 see ref .  .",
    "the appropriate size of @xmath59 depends on the rescaling parameter @xmath17 which determines the level - spacing of @xmath61 .",
    "if the recurrence relation shows divergence , @xmath59 is increased until the recursion becomes stable .",
    "further runs with different @xmath17 and @xmath59 are required to ensure parameter - independence of the results .",
    "we typically used @xmath17 equal to 10 - 20 times the bandwidth @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "when @xmath17 is chosen too small , it can not be compensated by increasing @xmath59 or @xmath64 , and the results become unstable .",
    "an additional drawback of the energy truncation approach is that in contrast to ground state or compression algorithms , it is _ not variational _ in character , hence no notion of optimality can be associated with it , and convergence of the method is not guaranteed .",
    "energy truncation has been speculated to be the major limiting factor of accuracy @xcite . in our calculations , we find that both usual matrix compression _ and _ energy truncation limit the accuracy of a simulation .      for convergence of the chebyshev recurrence ,",
    "any one - to - one mapping @xmath66 of the spectrum of @xmath1 into @xmath13 $ ] is sufficient .",
    "a natural choice for @xmath66 is to employ the exponential function , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the ground state energy , and @xmath69 is a small energy shift which avoids getting too close to the boundary @xmath70 . since the exponential function is bounded , no energy rescaling and no truncation step is needed .",
    "another advantage of this approach is that one can use a trotter - decomposition of @xmath67 , with sufficiently small @xmath71 , which is a standard tool for solving time dependent many - body systems @xcite .",
    "for small @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and thus the spectral resolution is approximately constant .",
    "however , the positive and negative branches of the zero frequency peak of @xmath36 now have to be calculated separately and then patched to give the full spectral function .",
    "a substantial drawback of this procedure is that both patches contain a jump at the fermi energy @xmath45 ( which is mapped to @xmath73 ) .",
    "using eq.([eq : momentrelation ] ) on the moments @xmath74 of @xmath66 results in a spectral function where the fermi edge of the hole part is mapped to @xmath75 and the fermi edge of the particle part is mapped to @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the resulting function has _",
    "two jumps_. the added moments @xmath77 then decay only algebraically , which requires many moments to be calculated and which is not well suited for linear prediction ( see below ) .",
    "the disadvantages are avoided by calculating the chebyshev moments of @xmath78 .",
    "then the spectral function is smooth over the whole expansion interval . as a result , eq.([eq : momentrelation ] ) can be used to good advantage and the full spectral function @xmath79 of @xmath66 can be obtained via moments @xmath80 .",
    "it can be mapped back to @xmath36 by plotting @xmath81 vs.  @xmath82 .",
    "we show initial results with this improved expansion in section [ sec:1-exp - tauh ] .",
    "steps and sharp features of @xmath36 will quite generally lead to ringing artefacts , known as gibbs oscillations , due to the necessarily finite expansion order of the moments @xmath44 .",
    "the usual remedy @xcite is to multiply @xmath44 by damping factors @xmath83 , i.e. , @xmath84 , and using @xmath85 instead of @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : momentrelation ] ) .",
    "different damping factors @xmath86 are related to different constraints on the expansion of @xmath36 ( like causality , smoothness , and so on ) , and have been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite .",
    "a common choice @xcite is lorentz damping @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the finite number of chebyshev polynomials employed , and @xmath89 is a parameter .",
    "while removing unwanted gibbs oscillations to an extent depending on @xmath89 , this damping also leads to a reduction of spectral resolution .",
    "in the following we will present a different approach to correct gibbs oscillations by numerically predicting the decay of the moments @xmath60 , using a linear prediction algorithm @xcite .",
    "linear prediction is a simple yet powerful tool to predict the behavior of a time series of equidistant data points .",
    "it is based on the ansatz that a data point @xmath90 can be approximated by a fixed linear combination of the previous @xmath91 data points : @xmath92 the fixed coefficients @xmath93 are obtained ( `` trained '' ) by minimizing the cost function @xmath94 using a _ training window _ of @xmath95 known data points . here , @xmath96 is a weighting function which we choose to be constant . the minimizing condition @xmath97 yields a set of linear equations , also known as the normal equations : @xmath98 with @xmath99 .",
    "the coefficients in @xmath100 are obtained by inverting the matrix @xmath101 , i.e. , in vector notation @xmath102 . for reasons of numerical stability of the algorithm",
    ", we use a pseudo - inverse with a cutoff @xmath103 instead of the full inverse of @xmath101 .",

    "( [ eq : predictlambda ] ) it is clear that the sequence of predicted data points will diverge if any @xmath113 .",
    "these divergences can arise due to numerical inaccuracies in the training moments , or when the spectral function has some weight outside the interval @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "in such cases these eigenvalues can be either set to zero or , as done in the present paper , renormalized to unity by .",
    "the choice should not matter as long as the corresponding coefficient @xmath114 is small .",
    "( [ eq : predictlambda ] ) also shows that linear prediction is best suited to reproduce time series ( which may contain oscillations ) with an exponentially decaying envelope .",
    "it is therefore advantageous to use prediction on the added moments @xmath115 , which will indeed decay exponentially when @xmath36 has no singularities in the expansion interval @xcite ( see above ) , rather than on @xmath116 and @xmath34 separately .",
    "similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , we subdivided our data as @xmath117 , which we found to give stable and accurate results .",
    "in general , an impurity model consists of a local interacting quantum system which is in contact with an infinite bath of non - interacting degrees of freedom , typically fermionic ones . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the single impurity anderson model ( siam ) @xcite , an archetypal impurity model .",
    "it consists of a single impurity with interaction , immersed in a sea of non - interacting spin - half fermions , given by the hamiltonian @xmath118 here , @xmath119 denotes the interaction , @xmath120 the energy - momentum dispersion of the bath , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 is the hybridization between impurity states with creation operator @xmath123 and bath states @xmath124 with annihilation operator @xmath125 .",
    "the impurity potential @xmath126 contains the chemical potential @xmath127 .",
    "the effect of the bath can be fully described by the spectrum of the hybridization function @xmath128 , with an imaginary part @xmath129 .",

    "@xmath140 determines the hybridization strength @xmath141 and @xmath142 .    in order to make it amenable to a numerical treatment",
    ", the infinite chain is cut at finite length @xmath143 , which is equivalent to a low - energy cutoff of the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "for other hybridization functions and arbitrary discretizations , one has to resort to numerical techniques @xcite with high precision arithmetics for the mapping of the higher dimensional impurity problem onto a chain geometry .    the siam hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : siam_disc ] ) is the starting point for various numerical schemes @xcite designed to compute ground state properties as well as dynamical properties of the impurity model , the most famous one being wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite .",
    "one of the most significant effects of a finite interaction is the redistribution of spectral weight of the impurity spectral function into three distinct features , the so - called upper and lower hubbard satellites , and a zero - frequency peak , the abrikosov - suhl ( or kondo ) resonance .",
    "the latter shows an exponentially decreasing width with increasing interaction , and determines the low - energy physics of the model .",
    "though nrg yields highly accurate results for this low - energy part of the spectrum , the high - energy features of the spectral function are usually poorly resolved due to the small number of points used in the logarithmic bath discretization at high energies .",
    "typical values of the discretization parameter range from @xmath144 to @xmath145 .",
    "smaller values drastically increase the computational effort for finding the ground state of the system , since an increasing number of states has to be kept during the nrg - iterations , which eventually becomes impossible to continue .",
    "also , the central assumption of scale - separation of energies is no longer valid . using more sophisticated methods , the resolution at finite frequencies can be improved . in refs .  , the spectral function was obtained by averaging over many different discretizations ( @xmath146-averaging @xcite ) in combination with using a very narrow broadening of the delta peaks obtained from nrg .",
    "this averaging procedure smoothens out the peaked structure of each single nrg - spectrum .",
    "an advantage of mps - based methods over nrg is the possibility to use an arbitrary discretization of the energy mesh for the bath spectral function , which can be used to increase the resolution of high energy features of the spectral function . in particular , the use of a linear instead of a logarithmic mesh at high energies helps to resolve high energy features of the spectral function .",
    "another shortcoming of the nrg is the exponential increase of computational cost with the number of impurity orbitals . for an @xmath147-orbital model , every orbital couples to its own bath of free electrons . in nrg",
    ", all local degrees of freedom have to be treated as a single site , giving a scaling of @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the local hilbert space dimension of a single orbital .",
    "in contrast , for mps , a simple unfolding of the problem can reduce the complexity down to @xmath150 for suitable models @xcite .",
    "for the siam , one can separate the two spin - degrees of freedom by unfolding the chain of spinful electrons into two chains of spinless fermions , interacting which each other at a single site .",
    "all calculations in this paper have been obtained using such a mapping .      dynamical mean field theory",
    "( dmft ) @xcite is a powerful method for the calculation of properties of strongly correlated models and materials .",
    "the central object of this theory is the local greens function @xmath151 of the full model at a given site .",
    "the basic idea of dmft is to approximate the effect of the interacting lattice electrons surrounding a given site by an appropriately chosen bath of free electrons at energies @xmath152 and hybridization of strength @xmath153 with the local site , yielding a hybridization function @xmath154 .",
    "the lattice problem is thus mapped onto an _ impurity _ problem of siam type .    in the dmft self consistency cycle , from the self - energy @xmath155 , the lattice greens function @xmath156 is calculated through the standard dyson equation of the lattice .",
    "then a non - interacting impurity greens function @xmath157^{-1}= \\sigma(\\omega_+ ) + [ g(\\omega_+)]^{-1}$ ] defines a siam with hybridization @xmath158^{-1}$ ] .",
    "we obtain the greens function @xmath156 of this siam by our mps solver ; from @xmath156 a new self - energy @xmath159^{-1 } - [ g(\\omega_+)]^{-1}$ ] is calculated . with this new self - energy",
    "the self - consistency cycle is iterated until converegency .    as for the mps implementation ,",
    "let us note that the impurity greens function can be obtained from the chebyshev moments @xcite through @xmath160 in the calculations , the small imaginary shift @xmath161 acts as a regularization parameter .",
    "it is set to a small non - zero value ( @xmath162 ) to make sure that the spectral density remains positive even in the presence of small gibbs - like oscillations at the band edges .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider the hubbard model on a bethe lattice with infinite connectivity , for which the dmft gives the exact solution @xcite . in this special case , the new siam hybridization function",
    "can also be calculated directly from the last iteration s green function : @xmath163 where @xmath131 is half the bandwidth of the free lattice model .",
    "as a first test for our method , we study the siam in the non - interacting limit ( @xmath164 ) , also known as the resonating level model ( rlm ) , which is exactly solvable . each component of our method can therefore be benchmarked separately and the calculated quantities can be compared to exact results . for @xmath164 the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "<S> we improve a recently developed expansion technique for calculating real frequency spectral functions of any one - dimensional model with short - range interactions , by postprocessing computed chebyshev moments with linear prediction . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved at virtually no cost and , in sharp contrast to existing methods based on the dampening of the moments , improves the spectral resolution rather than lowering it . </S>",
    "<S> we validate the method for the exactly solvable resonating level model and the single impurity anderson model . </S>",
    "<S> it is capable of resolving sharp kondo resonances , as well as peaks within the hubbard bands when employed as an impurity solver for dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) . </S>",
    "<S> our method works at zero temperature and allows for arbitrary discretization of the bath spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> it achieves similar precision as the dynamical density matrix renormalization group ( ddmrg ) , at lower cost . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose an alternative expansion , of @xmath0 instead of the usual @xmath1 , which opens the possibility of using established methods for the time evolution of matrix product states to calculate spectral functions directly . </S>"
