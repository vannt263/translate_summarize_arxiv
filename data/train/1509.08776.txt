    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) occurs with three - level atoms when a pair of optical transitions simultaneously addressed by a weak probe and strong coupling field share a common atomic state @xcite .",
    "this dramatically modifies the optical susceptibility of an atomic vapor as a result of quantum interferences between competing scattering channels @xcite . even though the refractive index in such a gas may differ from unity by less than a part per million , the dispersion line width can be deeply sub - natural , leading to a giant group index of refraction . critically , this enhanced dispersion is accompanied by reduced absorption . because of this , and",
    "the fact the dispersion is dynamically controllable , eit and related techniques have generated widespread interest for a number of applications , including slowing and storage of light @xcite , optical magnetometry @xcite , and precision timekeeping @xcite .",
    "here we study eit in the @xmath2 configuration in a heated potassium vapor .",
    "in contrast with more commonly used alkali atoms such as cesium and rubidium , eit in potassium is complicated by the fact that the frequency scale of doppler broadening is comparable to the ground state hyperfine splitting .",
    "this can result in unwanted probe absorption from atoms that are in the wrong combination of internal state and velocity class to undergo eit .",
    "however the relatively small hyperfine splitting in potassium also offers some practical advantages , for example with respect to the generation and detection of a mutually coherent pair of probe and coupling beams .",
    "furthermore in studies of coherent population trapping ( cpt ) with potassium , it was shown that the overlapping doppler profiles of the hyperfine ground states lead to reduced optical pumping and therefore enhanced cpt contrast when compared to cesium @xcite .",
    "this work was later extended to eit in antirelaxation - coated cells @xcite .",
    "the effects of optical pumping on cpt with cold potassium atoms also have been studied with an eye towards nuclear beta decay experiments with radioactive @xmath11k and @xmath12k @xcite .",
    "the small hyperfine splitting in potassium additionally makes it possible to enter the paschen - back regime at significantly lower magnetic fields than in cesium or rubidium @xcite .",
    "more recently @xmath2-eit - based cooling was used to enable lattice - site - resolved studies of correlated many - body states of quantum degenerate @xmath5k fermi gases @xcite , and ladder - eit spectroscopy of rydberg states in heated @xmath4k has been studied for future experiments with rydberg - dressed quantum gases of @xmath5k @xcite . in the present work",
    "we show how the richness of potassium eit can be enhanced with the addition of a uniform magnetic field .",
    "the resulting zeeman shifts lift the manifold degeneracies to induce a magneto - optical anisotropy whose polarization dependence highlights the role of coherence .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the experimental setup , and investigate the effects of vapor pressure and laser detuning on the group index of the gas . in section 3",
    "we study the system under the influence of an applied longitudinal magnetic field , and for different coupling beam polarizations .",
    "we exploit our configuration of co - propagating and spatially mode - matched probe and coupling beams to demonstrate a heterodyne measurement of the circular dichroism of the gas .",
    "we observe a significant dependence of the anisotropy on the angle between linear probe and coupling beam polarizations . a multi - level theoretical model is introduced and used to verify this result .",
    "finally , in section 4 we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "we implement eit on the d@xmath3 ( @xmath13 ) lines of potassium , shown schematically in fig .  [ exp_setup](a ) . the relatively small isotope shifts and hyperfine splittings mean that all of the d@xmath3 transitions for the two most naturally abundant potassium isotopes occur within a single doppler - broadened profile . given the @xmath14 abundance of @xmath4k ,",
    "the @xmath6k lines are typically not observed in our experiment ( see fig .  [ exp_setup](b ) ) , but the probe and coupling beams still address multiple @xmath4k transitions . considering the relative oscillator strengths and our typical detunings , we associate the probe with the @xmath15 manifold of @xmath4k transitions , and the coupling beam with @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the total electronic plus nuclear angular momentum and primes denote an excited state .",

    "[ exp_setup](c ) .",
    "the coupling beam is obtained from an external cavity diode laser running at a wavelength @xmath24  nm , and the probe beam , detuned blue by around @xmath25  mhz , is generated by splitting off a small fraction of the laser power and double - passing an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) .",
    "the two beams are recombined on a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) and coupled into orthogonal axes of a single - mode polarization - maintaining fiber .",
    "the beams are collimated together out of the fiber to a @xmath26 intensity diameter of @xmath27  mm .",
    "because the probe and coupling beams are co - propagating , the two - photon eit transition is effectively doppler - free ; from the ground - state hyperfine splitting , we calculate a broadening of 600  hz , which is negligible for even our narrowest features .",
    "since the interference effect responsible for eit is independent of the coupling beam detuning @xmath19 , a large fraction of atoms can contribute to the signal with relatively little dependence on the laser frequency .",
    "the relevant scale is set by the single - photon doppler width @xmath28 , which is typically @xmath29  mhz in half - width at half - maximum ( hwhm ) .",
    "we therefore are able to make all of the measurements described here without any active stabilization of the laser frequency .",
    "the probe and coupling beams co - propagate through a commercial reference cell with an internal length of @xmath30  mm and a natural abundance of potassium , with no buffer gas or anti - relaxation coating .",
    "thin - foil resistive heaters at each end of the cell control the vapor pressure and prevent condensation of potassium on the windows .",
    "although the heater wires trace out a meandering path to reduce stray magnetic fields , we find it necessary to momentarily turn them off during measurements in order to obtain the best transparency features .",
    "the assembly is placed within an aluminum lens tube sealed with anti - reflection - coated windows at each end and wrapped in thermal insulation . to control the magnetic field a solenoid",
    "is wound around the lens tube and the system is placed in a 24  cm long , two - layer cylindrical mu - metal shield without end caps .",
    "after the cell , the probe and coupling beams are separated by another pbs , and the probe power is detected with a biased photodiode whose output current is loaded by the 1  m@xmath31 input impedance of a digital oscilloscope .",

    "the real part @xmath37 describes a phase shift picked up by the probe light as it traverses the cell , with @xmath38 , and the imaginary part @xmath39 describes absorption through the absorption coefficient @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the wavenumber .",
