    "interactions between localized defects which are mediated by the continuum they are embedded in , play an important role in many areas of physics .",
    "typical examples are the rkky interaction between spins in a fermi liquid or the interaction between vortices in superfluids . in the present work , we discuss interactions between impurities in 1d quantum liquids .",
    "this study is motivated by the recent realization of strongly interacting `` atomic quantum wires '' with ultracold gases of both bosonic @xcite and fermionic atoms @xcite and the proposal @xcite , that single atoms in optical traps which are embedded in a superfluid reservoir allow to realize an atomic analog of a quantum dot with a tunable coupling to the environment .",
    "such quantum dots may be used to store qubits , which , under certain conditions , can be completely decoupled from their environment .",
    "arrays of these dots thus appear as ideal candidates for quantum information processing .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to study the induced interactions of such dots , mediated by the environment they are embedded in .",
    "similar questions arise also for quantum dots in solid state realizations , e.g. in carbon nanotubes @xcite , where the interaction is mediated by electrons in the intervening wire .",
    "quite generally , for both bosons and fermions , the low energy properties of a gapless 1d quantum liquid are described by the so called luttinger liquid ( ll ) phenomenology @xcite : the effective theory is a hydrodynamic energy functional characterized by the velocity of sound @xmath0 and the luttinger interaction parameter @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , for fermions , @xmath2 corresponds to the non - interacting case , while @xmath3 for repulsion . for repulsive bosons , in turn",
    ", one has @xmath4 , with @xmath5 in the limit of weak interactions , where a gross - pitaevskii or bogoliubov approximation applies . as shown by kane and fisher @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite for a recent discussion ) , the interaction of a single impurity with a ll depends crucially on the value of @xmath1 : for @xmath4 , the impurity is irrelevant for the low energy properties .",
    "a 1d bose liquid is therefore effectively superfluid , although there is no true condensate @xcite . for @xmath3",
    "the impurity changes the ground state of the liquid in a non - perturbative way , effectively cutting it into two disconnected parts . in this case",
    ", we will see that the induced interaction between two impurities is essentially a casimir - like effect .",
    "indeed , at low energies , two impurities at distance @xmath6 define a box with reflecting boundary conditions for the phonon modes of the quantum liquid , which leads to an attractive casimir interaction energy proportional to @xmath7 with @xmath0 the sound velocity .",
    "the case @xmath2 is marginal and corresponds to a non - interacting fermi gas in 1d or - equivalently - , a system of hard core bosons , the tonks - girardeau gas @xcite . in the following",
    "we will study the interactions mediated by the 1d quantum liquid between two impurities for the various cases , including fermions with spin .",
    "we focus our analysis on the case of _ static _ impurities , while the situation of a slow time dependence , relevant for atomic quantum dots , where the interactions depend on the internal states is only discussed qualitatively at the end of the paper .",
    "before considering the generic situation of impurities embedded in a sea of interacting particles , we first address the marginal case @xmath2 of non - interacting fermions . for simplicity",
    "we start from a gas of @xmath8 non - interacting spinless fermions in the presence of two localized impurities separated by a distance @xmath6 .",
    "considering cold gases in atomic quantum wires , the solution of this problem is not just an academic exercise . indeed , since fermions in a single hyperfine state have no s - wave interactions due to the pauli principle , they realize an ideal fermi gas at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "we assume that the particles are contained in a periodic box of length @xmath9 with average density @xmath10 .",
    "the ( grand canonical ) partition function of the liquid at a given temperature @xmath11 may be expressed in terms of a functional integral over the grassman fields @xmath12 representing the fermions : @xmath13 the corresponding action of an ideal gas is @xmath14 , \\label{eq : sfl}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the imaginary time running from @xmath16 to @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the chemical potential ( we use units such that @xmath19 ) .",
    "the fields are anti - periodic in imaginary time . for short range interactions , appropriate for cold atoms ,",
    "the interaction of the impurities with the liquid can be described by an additional contribution @xmath20 proportional to the local density at the impurity positions @xmath21 . here",
    ", the index @xmath22 labels the impurities , while the coupling constants @xmath23 describe the strength of collisions between the atoms in the liquid and the impurities .",
    "the expression for @xmath24 is based on assuming an effective pseudopotential for the interaction between the impurity and the quantum liquid .",
    "more precisely , the interaction should be replaced by a spatial integral of the detailed impurity potential with the microscopic density operator of the liquid . in the present section dealing with non - interacting fermions ,",
    "there is no need of a high energy cutoff , as one can directly work with the well behaved microscopic theory .",
    "however , in order to discuss the low energy behavior and to make contact with the following sections dealing with interacting fermions using the luttinger liquid phenomenology , we introduce a high energy cutoff @xmath25 .",
    "its value can be estimated as @xmath26 , where @xmath0 is the characteristic velocity of excitations ( @xmath27 in an ideal fermi gas ) , @xmath28 is the impurity size and @xmath29 is the chemical potential ( at zero temperature ) with @xmath30 , the fermi momentum . as will become clear from our results below , the coupling constants @xmath23 are then - up to a factor @xmath31 - identical with the dimensionless backscattering amplitudes @xmath32 for fermions at the impurities .",
    "microscopically , they are thus determined by the solution of the single particle scattering problem off a single impurity . in practice",
    ", an appreciable value of the backscattering amplitude requires the impurity size to be smaller or of the order of the interparticle spacing , since otherwise the fourier component of the potential at @xmath33 is close to zero , and hence the dimensionless coupling constants @xmath34 vanish .",
    "therefore , in the following , we will take @xmath35 .",
    "the grassman fields @xmath12 are free everywhere apart from the points @xmath36 and hence can be easily integrated out by the following standard trick : first we formally introduce four @xmath37-functions into the integrand @xmath38\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\delta[\\bar{\\psi}(x_{\\alpha},\\tau)-\\bar{\\eta}_{\\alpha}(\\tau ) ] \\,e^{-s_\\mathrm{fl}-s_{i}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are the new grassman variables describing the fermions at the location of the individual impurities .",
    "then we introduce a set of auxiliary fields @xmath40 using the identity @xmath41 to rise the @xmath37-functions into the action . finally , we integrate out the fermionic fields @xmath12 , which appear only quadratically , by fourier transformation : @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 where @xmath45 , and the summation is over the fermionic matsubara frequencies @xmath46 .",
    "the trivial prefactor @xmath47 arises from the integration over the fermionic fields in the absence of impurities , giving the grand partition function of the homogeneous liquid .",
    "the fields @xmath40 depend only on imaginary time @xmath15 , or frequency @xmath46 in the fourier representation and thus the integral over @xmath48 can be easily calculated . since for a sufficiently large separation @xmath49 ,",
    "the interaction energy is small , the relevant frequencies are small compared to the fermi energy @xmath50 .",
    "an expansion to leading order in @xmath51 then gives @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the characteristic frequency @xmath55 will play an important role in our subsequent discussions .",
    "physically it represents the inverse flight time for a characteristic excitation in the liquid between the locations of the two impurities , which naturally obeys the inequality @xmath56 provided the impurities are much further apart than the average distance between two fermions in the liquid .",
    "it is also the quantization energy between the two impurities . in order to obtain the impurity interaction directly from the partition function , we integrate out the auxiliary fields @xmath40",
    ". this results in an action @xmath57 which only depends on the four time dependent grassman fields @xmath39 which describe the fermi field at the impurity positions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath59 are defined by @xmath60 ) can now be written as @xmath61 where @xmath62 comes from the integration of the auxiliary fields : @xmath63 the total effective action @xmath64 is quadratic in the grassman fields @xmath39 and thus the integration can be done exactly to yield @xmath65 , with @xmath66\\ .\\ ] ] here , the @xmath67 are the dimensionless backscattering amplitudes , characterizing the interaction of the impurities and the liquid .",

    "the expression ( [ f12 ] ) is ill defined as it stands , since it contains both the energy of zero - point fluctuations in the gas , as well as the formally divergent self - energies of the separate impurities . the relevant interaction energy associated with a change of the separation of the two impurities",
    "is given by : @xmath71\\nonumber \\\\ & = & f ( \\gamma_{\\alpha},r)- f ( \\gamma_{\\alpha},\\infty ) .",
    "\\label{renorm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the renormalization thus requires subtracting first the free energy of the liquid without the impurities ( @xmath72 , vacuum energy ) and then the free energy of the system when the impurities are very far apart ( @xmath73 , self - energy of the impurities ) . while both the vacuum energy and the individual self - energies are infinite in the absence of a cutoff , the renormalized interaction ( [ renorm ] ) is finite and independent of the cutoff ( see also the discussion below in section [ classical ] ) .    at low temperature @xmath74",
    "we can switch from summation to integration according to @xmath75 , so that the effective interaction energy between the impurities can be expressed as : @xmath76 the integral can be performed analytically to yield our final result for the impurity interaction at @xmath77 : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the di - logarithmic function @xcite and @xmath80 is the real part .",
    "obviously the interaction quite generally falls off very slowly like @xmath81 with an amplitude , which is a strictly periodic function .",
    "its period @xmath82 is equal to the average inter - particle distance .",
    "this is a characteristic property of degenerate fermions , essentially reflecting the well known friedel oscillations of the density ( see below ) .",
    "trivially , the interaction vanishes , if one of the scattering amplitudes @xmath83 is zero .",
    "a simple expression for the renormalized interaction energy @xmath84 is obtained in two limiting cases .",
    "first , if the interaction of the impurities with the liquid is weak @xmath85 , we can expand the di - logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dilog ] ) to obtain : @xmath86 in the limit of strong impurities @xmath87 , we find in turn the result @xmath88 which is completely independent of the scattering amplitudes . in this case , the interaction energy @xmath84 can be represented as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a periodic function bounded as follows @xmath91 where : @xmath92 a simple way of understanding the slow @xmath81-decay and the oscillations with period @xmath93 may be obtained in the weak scattering limit eq .",
    "( [ eq : v12idealweak ] ) .",
    "indeed , the density perturbation created by a single impurity of strength @xmath94 at position @xmath95 is asymptotically given by : @xmath96 this expression for the friedel oscillations in a spinless 1d non - interacting fermi gas is valid in the limit where @xmath97 and @xmath98 @xcite . since the impurities couple to the local density",
    ", the interaction energy ( excluding self - energies ) of the system of two weak impurities is simply obtained from @xmath99 where @xmath85 . when renormalized @xmath100 , this interaction energy coincides with eq .",
    "( [ eq : v12idealweak ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the result may be derived by using the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) as shown in the appendix [ app : rpa ] .",
    "the analysis in this section is readily generalized to the case of a fermi gas with spin .",
    "in fact for non - magnetic impurities , such as considered in the current article , the two spin modes are decoupled and therefore the energy due to the presence of the two impurities is simply multiplied by a factor of two .",
    "it should be emphasized that the calculation above , can be immediately extended to the case of noninteracting fermions in two or three dimensions @xmath101 , giving rise to an interaction energy for weak coupling of the form @xmath102 where @xmath103 are the dimensionless backscattering amplitudes of the impurities .",
    "this result follows most simply by considering the density fluctuations @xmath104 induced by a single impurity at position @xmath105 .",
    "as discussed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite they exhibit friedel oscillations proportional to the dimensionless backscattering amplitude @xmath106 at the fermi energy .",
    "the resulting interaction energy is then simply given by @xmath107 .",
    "in fact , this is a special case of a general result @xcite , that the asymptotic interaction between two impurities is determined by the product of their backscattering amplitudes . in the presence of short range repulsive interactions between the fermions",
    ", we expect that the result ( [ 23d ] ) remains qualitatively correct in the case of two and three dimensions .",
    "this is based on the existence of a fermi liquid description in @xmath101 , which guarantees that the low energy properties are qualitatively unchanged from those of a fermi gas .",
    "for example , assuming that the static density response function at @xmath108 is given by the particle - hole bubble @xcite , the renormalization factor @xmath109 in the single - particle green function will give rise to a fermi liquid correction factor @xmath110 in @xmath84 . this argument , however , neglects possible vertex corrections in the density response which may lead to an enhancement rather than a suppression of the amplitude of the friedel oscillations .",
    "in fact this effectively happens in the one - dimensional case , where the vanishing @xmath111-factor gives rise to friedel oscillations , which decay more slowly than in the noninteracting case ( see below ) . while we are not aware of a quantitative calculation of the @xmath112-density response in fermi - liquids , it is very likely that they will give rise only to finite , multiplicative corrections to eq .",
    "( [ 23d ] ) .",
    "as we will see below , however , the situation in one dimension is quite different from that in @xmath101 in the sense , that even qualitatively the asymptotic form of the interaction is _ not _ given by the friedel oscillation picture , even for very weak impurities .    finally , we mention a recent work dealing with neutron matter .",
    "_ @xcite consider a neutron star crust , which is modeled as a degenerate non - interacting neutron gas ( i.e. an ideal 3d fermi gas ) containing various kinds of defects or inhomogeneities ( such as nuclei or bubbles ) immersed in it .",
    "these authors compute the interaction energy between two defects resulting from the quantum fluctuations of the fermi sea of neutrons .",
    "they obtain expressions similar to eq .",
    "( [ 23d ] ) , which can be interpreted as rkky - like interactions between defects .",
    "in addition , they discuss the influence of the shape of the defects and consider situations with more than two defects .",
    "realistic fermi systems consist of interacting particles . in three and also in two dimensions , it is possible to describe even strong interactions by landau s fermi liquid theory .",
    "as is well known , however , this concept fails in one dimension .",
    "here we consider fermions with repulsive short - range interaction . at low - energy",
    "such a system exhibits a gapless excitation spectrum with a linear dispersion , characteristic for the universality class of luttinger liquids ( ll ) @xcite .    for simplicity , we start by considering spinless fermions , for which the low - energy description is given by the following hydrodynamic action : @xmath113 .",

    "we consider repulsive interactions for which @xmath3 .",

    "the associated cutoff length @xmath116 is of order @xmath117 .",
    "of course , for a quantitative calculation of the scale at which the low energy description applies , a microscopic model is needed , which allows to determine nonuniversal properties . for single impurities in luttinger liquids",
    "this problem has only recently been discussed , see @xcite . since we are concerned with the interaction at distances much longer that the average interparticle separation , only the low energy properties are relevant , which are well described by the hydrodynamic action ( [ eq : llaction ] ) .",

    "the first term is just the constant hartree self - energy of the impurities , which - of course - does not contribute to the renormalized interaction energy @xmath84 .",
    "in addition , there are terms containing @xmath123 due to forward scattering .",
    "they describe quantum corrections to the self energies but again are irrelevant for the interaction @xmath84 between two widely separated impurities .",
    "the dominant term for this interaction is the contribution proportional to @xmath124 , which is due to backward scattering .",
    "in addition there are higher order terms like @xmath125 , however these are less relevant in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense @xcite . taking only the most relevant part of the interaction , the coupling between the impurities and the ll leads to the following nonlinear contribution to the action @xmath126\\approx \\int_0^{\\beta } \\mathrm{d}\\tau \\sum_{\\alpha=1,2 } 2 \\tilde{g}_{\\alpha } \\rho_0 \\cos[2\\sqrt{\\pi k}\\theta(x_\\alpha)+ 2 p_{f}x_{\\alpha}]\\ , \\label{eq : sitheta}\\ ] ] where we introduced the renormalized field @xmath127 by @xmath128 .",

    "by contrast , the factor @xmath140 which comes from the integration over the auxiliary fields , describes the change in the phonon modes due to the constraint on the fermi fields at the positions of the two impurities .",
    "similar to the noninteracting situation , this contribution depends on the associated characteristic frequency @xmath55 and is crucial in obtaining a finite interaction energy @xmath84 which is independent of the cutoff .    the remaining and now non - trivial functional integral over the time - dependent fields @xmath141 is of the same form as the one which appears in the context of quantum brownian motion in a periodic potential @xcite .",
    "indeed the effective action ( 29 ) basically describes two quantum particles subject to ohmic dissipation of dimensionless strength @xmath142 which move in a periodic potential generated by the backscattering amplitude .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite this problem leads to a localized ground state if @xmath143 with small fluctuations in the field @xmath127 . for a quantum liquid with sufficiently strong interactions between the fermions @xmath144 and strong impurities @xmath145 , the functional integral ( [ eq : smallkz ] ) over the time - dependent fields @xmath141",

    "the quantities @xmath149 play the role of effective frequencies for the evolution of the fields @xmath141 .",
    "the approximation of the original lagrangian ( [ eq : sitheta ] ) by the quadratic form ( [ eq : statphaseint ] ) is equivalent to an adiabatic approximation which describes physical processes occurring slower than a time scale given by @xmath150 . as the typical frequency of interest is @xmath151 , the stationary phase approximation is valid when @xmath152 .",
