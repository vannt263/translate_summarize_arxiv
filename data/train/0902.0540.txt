    "in a symplectic manifold there is a distinguished class of half - dimensional submanifolds on which the symplectic form vanishes .",
    "these are the lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "a pair of lagrangian submanifolds @xmath1 and @xmath2 which are smoothly isotopic but not isotopic through lagrangian embeddings is said to be _",
    "knotted_. a long - standing problem in symplectic topology is to understand lagrangian knotting .",
    "progress has been made in the case of lagrangian 2-spheres in symplectic 4-manifolds , as the following examples illustrate :    [ hindthm ] let @xmath3 be a neighbourhood of the zero - section in the cotangent bundle of @xmath4 , equipped with its canonical symplectic form .",
    "any lagrangian 2-sphere in @xmath3 can be isotoped through embedded lagrangian 2-spheres until it coincides with the zero - section .",
    "let @xmath5 be the plumbing of @xmath6 copies of the cotangent bundle of @xmath4 .",
    "in each homology class containing a lagrangian 2-sphere there are infinitely many smoothly isotopic lagrangian 2-spheres which are pairwise knotted .",
    "seidel s examples are constructed from the zero - sections by a process of iterated dehn twisting .",
    "a dehn twist is a symplectomorphism supported in a neighbourhood of a lagrangian sphere ( see @xcite ) and seidel s construction relies on the fact that the square of a dehn twist is isotopic to the identity smoothly but not through symplectomorphisms .",
    "actually showing that the images of the zero - sections under iterated dehn twists are non - isotopic involves calculating floer homology groups .",
    "hind s result is a beautiful application of the theory of punctured holomorphic curves . in the preprint @xcite",
    ", he also claims that any lagrangian sphere in seidel s @xmath7 space is isotopic to one obtained by iterated dehn twisting of a zero section .",
    "the present paper studies the isotopy question for lagrangian 2-spheres in _ symplectic del pezzo surfaces_.    a symplectic del pezzo surface is the symplectic manifold underlying a smooth complex projective surface with ample anticanonical line bundle .",
    "equivalently it is one of the following symplectic 4-manifolds :    * @xmath8 equipped with the product of the area-1 fubini - study forms on each factor ( this also arises as the khler form on a smooth quadric hypersurface in @xmath9 ) , * a symplectic blow - up @xmath10 of @xmath0 ( with its anticanonical symplectic form @xmath11 ) in @xmath12 symplectic balls of equal volume such that @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an exceptional sphere and @xmath15 is a line in @xmath0 .",
    "note that all these manifolds are monotone and support a complex structure for which the monotone symplectic form is khler .",
    "let us review what is known about lagrangian 2-spheres in del pezzo surfaces :    * @xmath0 , @xmath16 : neither of these spaces contains an embedded lagrangian 2-sphere .",
    "this is clear for homology reasons : by weinstein s neighbourhood theorem any lagrangian 2-sphere has self - intersection @xmath17 , but there is no such homology class in either of these spaces .",
    "* @xmath18 : this space contains a unique lagrangian 2-sphere up to isotopy .",
    "this theorem was also proved by hind @xcite . *",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 : it is easy to find lagrangian spheres in these spaces , but seidel has shown that the corresponding squared dehn twists are hamiltonian - isotopic to the identity , so there is no obvious way to produce knotting .",
    "* @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 : again , it is easy to find lagrangian 2-spheres in these spaces",
    ". it follows from some results of seidel on the symplectic mapping class groups of these spaces @xcite that knotting occurs .",
    "the main theorem of the present paper is the following :    [ bigthm ] there is no lagrangian knotting in @xmath19 , @xmath20 or @xmath21 .",
    "it is possible to find @xmath7 and @xmath26 configurations of lagrangian spheres inside @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively and",
    "a corollary of the theorem is that although two homologous lagrangian spheres in these configurations are isotopic , the isotopy must pass through lagrangian spheres which leave the @xmath27-neighbourhoods .",
    "the theorem is proved by first showing that one can find a lagrangian isotopy taking any 2-sphere @xmath1 to another sphere @xmath2 which is disjoint from some set of divisors .",
    "the divisors are chosen so that their complement is symplectomorphic to ( a compact subset of ) @xmath28 , whereupon hind s theorem guarantees that any two such spheres are lagrangian isotopic .",
    "achieving disjointness from divisors requires the technology of symplectic field theory and takes up most of the paper .",
    "the idea behind proving disjointness is to find a family of almost complex structures @xmath29 and a family @xmath30 of @xmath31-holomorphic curves representing the relevant configuration of divisors such that :    * @xmath32 is the standard complex structure and @xmath33 is the standard configuration of divisors , * @xmath34 is disjoint from @xmath1 .",
    "then it is not hard ( see section [ isoprf ] ) to construct a disjoining isotopy of @xmath1 from @xmath33 .",
    "the almost complex structures @xmath31 are obtained by a process called `` stretching the neck '' around @xmath1 ( see diagram [ nstretch ] below ) .",
    "the @xmath31-holomorphic curves are proven to exist in section [ singularpseudo ] .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath30 as @xmath35 is analysed using symplectic field theory and it is shown in sections [ prf ] and [ prf2 ] that for large @xmath36 , @xmath30 must be disjoint from @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath37    we should also remark that for higher blow - ups , similar arguments work to disjoin lagrangians from divisors , but it is hard to find divisors whose complements are as well - understood as @xmath28 .",
    "for example , a lagrangian sphere in the homology class @xmath38 in @xmath10 ( @xmath39 ) can be disjoined from the exceptional spheres @xmath40 .",
    "blowing - down these @xmath41 exceptional spheres leaves us with @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath2 are lagrangian spheres in the homology class @xmath38 in @xmath10 ( @xmath39 ) then we can isotope them both into the complement of the exceptional spheres @xmath40 and blow - down these spheres to points @xmath42 .",
    "a corollary of theorem [ bigthm ] is that any two lagrangian spheres in @xmath19 are smoothly isotopic and we can choose that smooth isotopy to avoid the @xmath41 points @xmath42 .",
    "the result is a smooth isotopy of @xmath1 and @xmath2 in @xmath10 .",
    "this is certainly a symplectic phenomenon , as one can always knot smoothly embedded spheres topologically ( for example by connect - summing locally with a smoothly knotted @xmath43 ) .    in outline :    * in section [ prelim ] we will review some basic facts about symplectic del pezzo surfaces , their homology and lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "we also clarify the statement of theorem [ bigthm ] and reformulate it as theorem [ isothm ] .",

    "we give details of the setup for neck - stretching in our case and prove some basic properties of the limit .",
    "* sections [ prf ] and [ prf2 ] analyse the sft limits of our families of pseudoholomorphic curves under neck - stretching and deduce disjointness of certain pseudoholomorphic curves from @xmath1 .",

    "recall that under symplectic blowing up , a ball of volume @xmath69 is replaced by a symplectic @xmath70-sphere of area @xmath71 , so the cohomology class of @xmath66 is again @xmath64 . since @xmath66 is khler for the complex structure of the del pezzo surface , by moser s theorem it is symplectomorphic ( indeed isotopic ) to @xmath44 .",
