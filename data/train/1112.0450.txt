    "they found that the cleavage activity decreases approximately 10-fold as the tension increases from 30 fn to 700 fn .",

    "they found that for the loop size larger than 100 base pair distance ( @xmath1 nm ) , a tension of 0.5 pn can increase the looping time by more than two order of magnitude .",
    "there is room for improvement in their approach , however , on the evaluation of the free energy that can be valid for short end - to - end distance of the chain as well as a description of detailed kinetic process using the mean first - passage time approach .    in this paper , in an effort to understand the basic physical mechanism of the biopolymer looping in a coherent manner , we perform brownian dynamics simulation of semiflexible polymers treated as extensible wormlike chain , combined with one - dimensional theory of barrier crossing over the free energy of loop formation . for analytical understanding ,",
    "we use , as an example , the mean - field wormlike chain model  @xcite , which is shown to be a good approximation for the free energy for the chain lengths we consider here . with static tensions , we find that the looping time , defined as the mean first - passage time to cross the free energy barrier , steeply increases with the applied tension @xmath2 , in an agreement with our simulation results but distinct from the previous theoretical result  @xcite . for the case of time - dependent tension , we consider dichotomically fluctuating tension , where the looping times are found to be reduced , consistent with the experiment  @xcite .",
