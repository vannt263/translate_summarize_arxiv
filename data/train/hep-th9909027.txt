    "d - branes @xcite are indispensable objects in string theories to the understanding of their non - perturbative aspects , including various dualities @xcite . one way to examine string dualities",
    "is to use the d - brane action which is a low energy effective action of massless fields induced on the d - brane @xcite .",
    "for example , taking the worldvolume dual of the d@xmath1-brane action , we obtain a nambu - goto string action with a tension rotated by @xmath2 duality transformation which is conjectured to exist in type iib superstring theory @xcite .",
    "similar analyses have been performed for other cases , such as d@xmath3-brane ( @xmath4 ) actions or super-@xmath3-brane actions @xcite . as another argument on string dualities using d - brane action",
    "we cite ref .",
    "@xcite , which shows that the bps mass spectra given as a volume factor of the d - brane action describing compactified d - branes are consistent with u - duality .",
    "the d - brane actions used in the above analyses are the ones given by the lowest order calculation in the string @xmath0 model approach @xcite , or in the open string partition function approach @xcite , in addition to the ordinary scattering amplitude approach @xcite .",
    "higher order calculations of the d - brane actions have been known through the latter approaches @xcite , in the trivial background of the massless sector of the closed string excitations ( flat metric and no kalb - ramond two - form field ) .",
    "this adds to the d - brane action higher derivative ( @xmath5 ) corrections , which , however , may ruin the dualization procedure of refs .",
    "terms ) are calculated and its consistency with string dualities is checked @xcite . ]",
    "therefore , a systematic framework which gives higher derivative corrections to the d - brane action is highly desired .    since d - branes are defined as hypersurfaces on which the boundaries of the string worldsheets can sit , the boundary states @xcite describe the dynamics of the d - branes well . a part of the d - brane action ( more precisely , couplings to the fields of the closed string excitations ) is encoded in the boundary state @xcite . however , this boundary state is defined as an eigen state of the boundary conditions for the oscillating modes of the attached string , the explicit form of the boundary state has been given only for simple backgrounds which give linear boundary conditions .",
    "one of those configurations is the constant field strength on the d - brane .",
    "therefore , boundary states including general configuration of the boundary gauge field give us a method to calculate the higher derivative corrections to the d - brane action .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a d - brane sector was introduced to the system of covariant closed bosonic string field theory ( sft ) @xcite .",
    "the d - brane action corresponds to the source term in this sft , and the boundary state is a constituent of it .",
    "the dynamical degree of freedom of the boundary state adopted there was only the constant field strength . in this scheme of sft ,",
    "a @xmath0 model gauge transformation was realized is such a way that it yields a constant shift of the gauge field strength in the boundary state .    in this paper",
    ", we present a generalized boundary state , which is constructed by a gauge transformation in the sft .",
    "this boundary state incorporates the non - constant modes of @xmath6 and gives the derivative corrections to the d - brane actions .",
    "our new boundary state is defined for an arbitrary gauge field configuration @xmath7 , and we carry out the explicit calculations up to the second order in the derivatives on @xmath6 .",
    "this boundary state includes divergences , and the requirement for these divergences to vanish gives a constraint on the configuration of the gauge field @xmath7 .",
    "this constraint is shown to be identical with the vanishing of the @xmath8 function in a string @xmath0 model , hence we regard this constraint as an equation of motion for the gauge field .",
    "after this regularization procedure for the boundary state , we obtain the higher derivative corrections to the d - brane action , by extracting relevant parts in the boundary state .",
    "it is expected that this generalized boundary state serves as an useful tool for the investigation of the dualities or other dynamics in string theory .",
    "the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows . in the next section , after summarizing the properties of the boundary states adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite , this boundary state is generalized to the one which has non - constant @xmath6 boundary coupling . in sec .",

    "[ sec : extending ] , we calculate the correction to the d - brane action . the final section is devoted to our conclusion and discussions .",
    "we include an appendix where the calculation of the formula appearing in this paper is given .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a certain sector of the boundary state is related to the low energy effective action of d - branes @xcite . the boundary state adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite and in most of the literatures has a single free parameter , that is ,",
    "_ constant _ field strength of the gauge field on the d - brane .",
    "therefore the obtained effective action on the d - brane contains only the constant field strength . in this section ,",
    "we generalize the boundary state so that it includes _ non - constant _ modes of the field strength , in order to calculate the corrections to the d - brane action .",
    "these corrections correspond to the derivative corrections , since we expand the field strength by derivatives .",
    "first let us summarize the relevant properties of the boundary state with the constant field strength .",
    "the boundary state @xmath9 is defined as an eigen state of the boundary conditions for open bosonic strings @xcite : @xmath10 the brst invariance of the boundary state is a consequence of eqs.([x_b=0 ] )  ( [ pi_c_b ] ) .",
    "the oscillator representation of @xmath11 reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 the orthogonal matrix @xmath14 is defined as @xmath15 .",
    "although the front factor @xmath16 is arbitrary , this can be fixed by various ways @xcite . here",
    "we shall follow ref.@xcite , where the gauge invariance principle for the d - brane ( source ) term in the closed sft action has fixed the front factor .",
    "only when the front factor is given by @xmath17 the boundary state is subject to the following sft gauge transformation : @xmath18 where the @xmath19 product denotes three string interaction vertex .",
    "a string field @xmath20 is a gauge transformation parameter @xmath21 with @xmath22 and we have defined the gauge transformation for the variable @xmath23 as @xmath24 for verifying the gauge transformation ( [ b*f ] ) , we have used a relation on the @xmath19 product @xmath25 for the above @xmath20 ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "the gauge transformation for the closed string field is given by @xmath26 therefore with the transformation parameter ( [ lambda ] ) , the inhomogeneous part of the gauge transformation ( [ transp ] ) generates a shift of a component kalb - ramond gauge field @xmath27 in @xmath28 by @xmath29 .",
    "( our notation of sft is given in ref .",
    "this fact is expected from the gauge symmetry of the string @xmath0 model , which is defined as @xmath30 and @xmath31@xcite .",
    "note that in the string @xmath0 model approach , this gauge transformation @xmath32 generates all the modes of the gauge field @xmath7 on the boundary .",
    "therefore , in order to generalize the boundary state to the one incorporating the functional degree of freedom @xmath7 ( or @xmath6 ) , it is natural to demand the following relation for the new boundary state @xmath33 : @xmath34 in this relation the parameter string field @xmath20 is defined by ( [ lambda ] ) for an _ arbitrary _ function @xmath35 , and the gauge transformation law concerning @xmath7 is @xmath36    since the gauge transformation ( [ gaugetr ] ) generates an arbitrary deformation of @xmath7 by the parameter @xmath35 , @xmath37 is obtained by `` integrating '' eq .",
    "( [ transnew ] ) . for this purpose",
    "we use the following formula for the star product @xmath38 between the present @xmath20 and an arbitrary string functional @xmath39 ( the derivation is given in app .",
    "[ app : star ] ) : @xmath40 this is a generalization of the identity ( [ precon ] ) . assuming that the ghost part of the new boundary state is given by the same form ( eq .  ( [ ghostf ] ) ) as before , the second term on the rhs of eq .  ( [ star ] ) acting on the state @xmath41 vanishes due to the ghost boundary condition ( [ pi_c_b ] ) .",
    "then the desired generalized boundary state @xmath41 is obtained by exponentiating the operator on the rhs of ( [ star ] ) : this definition is very natural in the sense of path - integral approach of string @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "the boundary state is regarded as an initial or final wave functional for the path - integral .",

    "the new boundary state ( [ bnew ] ) is reduced to the previous one ( [ bou ] ) when the dynamical variable is restricted to the constant field strength @xmath51 since the neumann part of the previous boundary state ( [ bou ] ) is written in a form @xmath52    our @xmath41 satisfies various desired properties .",

    "one of the other properties of @xmath41 is the brst invariance which is important to understand loop - corrected equations of motion for closed string theory @xcite where we consider only the linearized part .",
    "the equation of motion follows as @xmath58 hence multiplying @xmath59 on this expression we obtain a constraint @xmath60 .",
    "this constraint of the brst invariance of the boundary state is also deduced from the gauge invariance of the whole sft action@xcite . ] .",

    "the new boundary state ( [ bnew ] ) for a general ( polynomial ) @xmath7 is made of products of the operators @xmath68 s at the same point @xmath0 and therefore it inevitably contains divergences .",
    "we shall show in this subsection that these divergences can be absorbed into the redefinition of the gauge field as @xmath69 .",
    "we require that the divergent part @xmath70 to vanish , in order to obtain a well - defined boundary state .",
    "eventually , constraint equation is found to be identical with the vanishing of the @xmath8 function of the string @xmath0 model coupling .",
    "thus this requirement of no - divergence coincides with the condition of the conformal invariance in the string @xmath0 model .    for studying the divergences in the new boundary state",
    ", we divide @xmath71 into the zero mode and the non - zero mode part @xmath72 , @xmath73 and taylor - expand @xmath74 around the zero mode @xmath75 as @xmath76 we denote the contribution of the second term on the rhs of ( [ aexpand ] ) to @xmath42 $ ] ( [ u[a ] ] ) by @xmath77 and that of the rest terms by @xmath78 , and express @xmath42 $ ] as @xmath79=v u_0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] explicitly , we have @xmath80 and @xmath81 in ( [ v ] ) we have written explicitly only those terms where the total number of derivatives acting on @xmath6 is at most two .",
    "since the operator @xmath77 acting on @xmath82 generates the `` old '' boundary state ( [ bou ] ) with @xmath83-dependent field strength ( cf . , eq .",
    "( [ dividef ] ) ) , @xmath84 the new boundary state ( [ bnew ] ) is expressed as @xmath85 note that the approximation to the first order with respect to the derivative acting on the field strength , where @xmath78 is put to be @xmath1 , does _ not _ reduce @xmath41 to the previous ( brst invariant ) boundary state @xmath9 considered in the ref .",
    "actually , the decomposition of @xmath42 $ ] into @xmath86 does not respect the brst invariance at each order in the expansion of @xmath78 .",
    "next , we shall evaluate the representation ( [ vb ] ) by expressing it only by the creation operators acting upon @xmath87 .",
    "namely , we change all the annihilation operators in @xmath78 into the creation ones with use of the neumann boundary condition satisfied by @xmath87 : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is an orthogonal matrix defined by @xmath90 the calculation is straightforward and we here present only the results ( see app .  [",
    "app : div ] for the detailed calculation ) .",
    "the unitary operator @xmath78 reexpressed in terms of creation operators contains two kinds of divergences , @xmath91 adopting the zeta function regularization , @xmath92 , we find that the @xmath93 divergence is absorbed into the redefinition of the field strength @xmath94 : @xmath95 { { \\left| b\\bigl(f(x)\\bigr)\\right\\rangle}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the redefined @xmath96 containing the @xmath93 divergence is given by @xmath97.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we have kept only those terms written explicitly in eq.([v ] ) .",

( [ aren ] ) should put equal to zero .",
    "therefore we obtain a constraint on the configuration of the gauge field @xmath100 at a glance one recognizes that this @xmath101 is identical with the beta function for the gauge field coupling in the string @xmath0 model @xcite .",
    "hence the constraint ( [ beta ] ) for the generalized boundary state coincides with the conformal invariance condition in the string @xmath0 model .",
    "we shall explain the detailed correspondence between our formalism and the string @xmath0 model approach in the next subsection .",
    "we have seen in the previous subsection that the divergences immanent in the newly defined boundary state coincide with the result in the string @xmath0 model .",

    "however , two approaches appear to be clearly different in the following respect : although the @xmath0 model approach gives a loop contribution to the gauge potential itself , the divergences in the boundary state show up in the form of the redefinition of the field strength . in this subsection",

    "the origin of this coincidence is studied in the @xmath0 model side , and we have found that the divergences in the new boundary state can be identified with the one - loop contribution to the worldsheet propagator in the string @xmath0 model .    utilizing this boundary state ,",

    "there still remains many subjects to be studied . in this paper",
