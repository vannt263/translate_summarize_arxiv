    "the problem of combining the results of several independent searches for a new particle and producing a confidence level ( cl ) has become very important at the lep collider in its high - energy phase of running .",
    "typically , both the expected number of signal events and the expected number of background events are small , and few candidate events are observed in the data for any particular search analysis . the ability to exclude the presence of a possible signal at a desired cl is often improved significantly by combining the results of several searches , particularly if the sensitivity is limited by the collected luminosity , and not by a kinematic boundary .",
    "in addition , sophisticated search analyses may provide information about the observed candidates , such as one or more reconstructed masses or other experimental information relating to the expected features of the signal .",
    "these variables provide better discrimination of signal from background , and also help to indicate which signal hypothesis is preferred among many .",
    "sometimes no such information is available , and these search analyses must be combined with other types of analyses for an optimal cl . binning the search results of the analyses in their discriminant variables and treating each bin as a statistically independent counting search provides a simple , uniform representation of the data well suited for combination .",
    "often , as is the case with searches for mssm higgs bosons at lep2 , a broad range of model parameters which affect the production of signal events must be considered and exclusion limits placed for all possible values of these parameters .",
    "the expected experimental signatures of the new particles in general vary with the model parameters which govern their production and decay , and the combination of complementary channels provides the best exclusion for all values of the parameters .",
    "a rapid procedure for computing confidence levels is therefore necessary in order to explore fully the possibilities of the model .",
    "this article describes an efficient , approximate method of computing combined exclusion confidence levels in these cases , allowing also for the possibility of uncertainty in the estimated signal and background .",
    "for the case of @xmath0 independent counting search analyses , one may define a test statistic @xmath1 which discriminates signal - like outcomes from background - like ones .",
    "an optimal choice for the test statistic is the likelihood ratio  @xcite .",
    "if the estimated signal in the @xmath2 channel is @xmath3 , the estimated background is @xmath4 , and the number of observed candidates is @xmath5 , then the likelihood ratio can be written as @xmath6 with @xmath7 this test statistic has the properties that the joint test statistic for the outcome of two channels is the product of the test statistics of the two channels separately , and that it increases monotonically in each channel with the number of candidates @xmath5 .",
    "the confidence level for excluding the possibility of simultaneous presence of new particle production and background ( the @xmath8 hypothesis ) , is @xmath9 _ i.e. _ , the probability , assuming the presence of both signal and background at their hypothesized levels , that the test statistic would be less than or equal to that observed in the data .",
    "this probability is the sum of poisson probabilities @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the test statistic computed for the observed set of candidates in each channel @xmath12 , and the sum runs over all possible final outcomes @xmath13 which have test statistics less than or equal to the observed one .",
    "the confidence level @xmath14 may be used to quote exclusion limits although it has the disturbing property that if too few candidates are observed to account for the estimated background , then any signal , and even the background itself , may be excluded at a high confidence level .",
    "it nonetheless provides exclusion of the signal at exactly the confidence level computed . because the candidates counts are integers , only a discrete set of confidence levels is possible for a fixed set of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "a typical limit computation , however , involves also computing the confidence level for the background alone , @xmath15 where the probability sum assumes the presence only of the background .",
    "this confidence level has been suggested to quantify the confidence of a potential discovery , as it expresses the probability that background processes would give fewer than or equal to the number of candidates observed .",
    "then the modified frequentist confidence level @xmath16 is computed as the ratio @xmath17 this confidence level is a natural extension of the common single - channel cl=1-@xmath16  @xcite , and for the case of a single counting channel is identical to it .",
    "the task of computing confidence levels for experimental searches with one or more discriminating variables measured for each event reduces to the case of combining counting - only searches by binning each search analyses results in the measured variables .",
    "each bin of , _",
    "e.g. _ , the reconstructed mass , then becomes a separate search channel to be combined with all others , following the strategy of  @xcite and the neutrino - oscillation example of  @xcite . in this case , the expected signal in a bin of the reconstructed mass depends on the hypothesized true mass of the particle and also on the expected mass resolution . if the error on the reconstructed mass varies from event to event such that the true resolution is better for some events and worse for others , then the variables @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 may be binned in both the reconstructed mass and its error to provide the best representation of the available information . by exchanging information in bins of the measured variables , different experimental collaborations",
    "may share all of their search result information in an unambiguous way without the need to treat the measured variables in any way during the combination .    for convenience , one may add the @xmath3 s , the @xmath4 s , and the @xmath5 s of channels with similar @xmath21 and retain the same optimal exclusion limit , just as the data from the same search channel may be combined additively for running periods with the same conditions . the same search with a new beam energy or other experimental difference should of course be given its own set of bins ( which may be combined with others of the same @xmath21 ) .",
    "the task of summing the terms of equation  [ clsbequation ] can be formidable . for @xmath0 channels , each with @xmath22 possible outcomes , there are @xmath23 terms to compute .",
    "this sum is often carried out with a monte carlo  @xcite , selecting representative outcomes of the experiment and comparing their test statistics with the test statistic computed with the data candidate event counts .",
    "another alternative , described in this article , is to compute the probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the test statistic for a set of channels , and iteratively combine additional channels by convoluting with the pdfs of their test statistics .",
    "the pdf of the test statistic for a single channel is a sum of delta functions at the accessible values of @xmath24 .",
    "these may be represented as a list of possible outcomes @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the test statistic for the @xmath2 channel if it were to have @xmath27 events , and @xmath28 is the poisson probability of selecting @xmath27 events in the @xmath2 channel if the underlying average expected rate is @xmath29 when computing @xmath30 , or only @xmath4 when computing @xmath31 .",
    "the list is formally infinitely long , but one may truncate it when the total probability sum of the outcomes in the list exceeds a fixed quantity , or one may select all @xmath27 such that @xmath32 .",
    "for the case of two channels , one forms the probabilities and test statistics for the joint outcomes multiplicatively , @xmath33 to form a representation of the pdf of the test statistic for the joint outcomes of two channels .",
    "one may then iteratively combine all channels together and use the list to compute the confidence level by adding the probabilities of outcomes with test statistics less than or equal to that observed .",
    "this reintroduces the computational difficulty of enumerating all possible experimental outcomes , and hence one needs to introduce an approximation to limit the complexity of the problem .",
    "the approximation is to bin the pdf of the test statistic at each combination step",
    ". the cumulative pdf may be obtained from the listing of outcomes by sorting them by their test statistics and accumulating the probabilities .",
    "then fine bins of the cumulative pdf may be filled with possible outcomes .",
    "a useful binning covers very small probabilities logarithmically in order to represent small cl s more exactly , and has a uniform binning for larger probabilities .",
    "the finer the bins , the more precise the computed cl will be ; in the limit of infinitely fine bins , the problem reduces once again to adding the probabilities of all possible outcomes .    to guarantee a conservative cl for setting limits ,",
    "one may , at each combination step , record as a possible experimental `` outcome '' the smallest test statistic within a bin coupled with the largest accumulated probability within the same bin .",
    "the list now consists of test statistics and the cumulative probability of observing that test statistic or less , and the differential pdf of @xmath1 may be recovered from it .",
    "the process is then repeated iteratively for all channels to be combined .",
    "the running time on a computer is proportional to the number of channels , the number of bins kept in the pdf of @xmath1 , and increases with the expected number of events in the channels . to improve the accuracy of the approximation ,",
    "the search channels should be sorted in order of @xmath21 , with the channels with the largest @xmath21 combined last .",
    "once all channels have been combined , the test statistic is computed for the candidate events observed in the experiment and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath16 may be computed using equations  [ clsbdefinition ] , [ clbdefinition ] and  [ clsdefinition ] .",
    "furthermore , the pdfs of @xmath1 in the signal+background and background hypotheses allow computation of the expected confidence levels @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , assuming the presence only of background .",
    "these are indications of how well an experiment would do on average in excluding a signal if the signal truly is not present , and are the important figures of merit when optimizing an analysis for exclusion .",
    "when computing @xmath35 , the outcomes are already ordered by their test - statistic and only the probabilities are needed : @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the number of entries in the table of the pdf of @xmath1 for the background - only hypothesis , and @xmath39 is the @xmath40 probability in the list , where the test statistic @xmath1 increases with increasing @xmath27 . for total expected backgrounds of more than about 3.0 events in channels with non - negligible sensitivity to the signal , @xmath41 .",
    "the values of @xmath34 and @xmath36 can be computed similarly , although the pdf of @xmath1 is needed in the @xmath8 hypothesis as well as the background - only hypothesis .",
    "@xmath42,\\ ] ] and @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the @xmath40 entry in the pdf table of @xmath1 for the @xmath8 hypothesis , and @xmath45 is its corresponding value of @xmath1 .",
    "the difference between this method and that described by cousins and feldman  @xcite is the choice of test statistic ( referred to as the `` ordering principle '' in  @xcite ) .",
    "the likelihood ratio of equation  [ likelihoodratioequation ] has the advantages that it is the most powerful test statistic for distinguishing the @xmath8 hypothesis from the background - only hypothesis , and also because it does not depend on the range of possible models of new physics considered when testing a particular signal hypothesis . with the test statistic of  @xcite",
    ", a signal hypothesis can be excluded because other signal hypotheses fit the data better .",
    "the use of the test statistic of  @xcite does not allow the exclusion of the entire model space under study ",
    "one must be careful to include the null hypothesis of no new particle production in the space of models to be tested .",
    "in addition , there may be more than one new physics signal present in the data .",
    "the method of  @xcite is ideal for the case in which the possible model space is fully known , and it is known that exactly one of the points in model space corresponds to the truth .    for purposes of discovery , @xmath46 indicates the probability that the background could have fluctuated to produce a distribution of candidates at least as signal - like as those observed in the data .",
    "this probability depends on the signal hypothesis because channels with small @xmath21 do not contribute as much to the computation of @xmath31 as those with large @xmath21 . in the case that a particle of unknown mass is sought , analyses which reconstruct the mass provide discrimination among competing signal hypotheses when a clear signal is present , rather than the presence of an excess of candidates .",
    "nonetheless , the probability in the upper tail of the @xmath1 distribution in the @xmath8 hypothesis may be used to exclude a signal hypothesis because it does not predict enough signal to explain the candidates in the data .",
    "the effect on the confidence levels from systematic uncertainties in the signal estimations @xmath47 and background estimations @xmath48 can be accommodated by a generalization of the method of cousins and highland  @xcite .",
    "this approach was originally created for one - channel searches with systematic uncertainty on the signal estimation only .",
    "a very similar approach for handling background uncertainty is described by c. giunti in  @xcite .",
    "the generalization of this technique to the case of many channels with errors on both signal and background is summarized here .",
    "when forming the list of the probabilities and test statistics of possible outcomes for a channel , each entry in the list is affected by the systematic uncertainties on the signal and background estimations for that channel .",
    "this effect is computed by averaging over possible values of the signal and background given by their systematic uncertainty probability distributions . for purposes of implementation",
    ", these probability distributions are assumed to be gaussian , with the lower tail cut off at zero , so that negative @xmath18 or @xmath19 are not allowed .",
    "when computing the pdf of @xmath1 for the @xmath8 case , the probability to observe @xmath27 events in channel @xmath49 with estimated signal @xmath50 and estimated background @xmath51 , is @xmath52 which is used in each entry in the list of equation  [ plistequation ] . while the denominator is a product of error functions ,",
    "the numerator may be computed numerically . when computing the pdf of @xmath1 for the background - only case , the averages are only done over the background variation .    to extend this to the multichannel case ,",
    "additionally the test statistic must be averaged over the systematic variations because it , too , depends on @xmath3 and @xmath4 : @xmath53 this average is also computed numerically . it is computed both when the sum over all possible experimental outcomes is performed and when the test statistic is computed for the data candidates , ensuring that the data outcome is identical with one of the possible outcomes in the pdf tables .",
    "this is important for confidence levels computed with a single channel , when all outcomes are listed in the pdf table .",
    "the above algorithm has been tested in a variety of ways . for general use , a program implementing it is available at + http://home.cern.ch/@xmath54thomasj/searchlimits/ecl.html .    * if a single channel has 3.0 expected signal events , no expected background events , and no observed candidates , then @xmath55 as expected from an exact computation .",
    "@xmath56 in this case . for experiments with few possible outcomes , this technique yields exact cl s . *",
    "if this single channel is broken up into arbitrarily many pieces ( say , a few hundred ) , equally dividing up the 3 expected signal events , each with no background or candidates , the limit is the same as that for the single channel . *",
    "if a channel with no expected signal , but some expected background ( and corresponding data candidates ) is added to the combination , then @xmath16 is not changed significantly , while @xmath30 and @xmath31 reflect the relationship between the expected background and the observed candidate count . * a more realistic example requiring",

    "for each pair of @xmath58 and the signal count , histograms of the expected signal and background were formed in fine bins from 0 to 100  gev/@xmath57 .",
    "the candidates were also histogrammed using the same binning as the signal and background .",

    "this latter test statistic is the event count weighted by the signal / background ratio , and it is combined additively from channel to channel . +",

    "the exclusion fraction is smaller than 5% for low expected signal rates , a consequence of the use of the bayesian @xmath62 , where some of the exclusion power is lost by dividing by @xmath31 .",
    "alternatively , one may use @xmath30 exclusively , which would give the proper limit . in the latter case , the sensitivity @xmath34",

    "the results of this test are shown in table  [ cousinshighlandreptable ] .",
    "because the binning of the pdf of the test statistic @xmath1 has a finite resolution , experimental outcomes with very small probabilities of occurring are not represented correctly .",
    "when using the conservative choice of filling the bins described above , these outcomes are overrepresented in the final outcome . for the purposes of discovery , however , this approach is not conservative .",
    "when computing the cl for a potential discovery , one must compute the sum of probabilities of fluctuations of the background giving results that look at least as much like the signal as the observed candidates , or more .",
    "conversely , one may add up all the probabilities for outcomes less signal - like than observed and subtract it from unity .",
    "this involves precise accounting of many outcomes with small probabilities , and the approximation presented here will not suffice .",
    "the most useful case for this technique is in forming cl limits near the traditional 90% , 95% , and 99% levels .",
    "another limitation is that correlations between the systematic uncertainties of different search channels are not incorporated .",
    "if the results of a search are binned in a discriminant variable , the signal estimations in neighboring bins may share common uncertainties , as may the background estimations .",
    "similarly , if several experimental collaborations perform similar searches using similar models for the signal and background , then their results will share common systematic uncertainties .",
    "a monte carlo computation of the confidence levels is needed when the effects of correlated errors are expected to be large . the effect can be estimated by replacing blocks of correlated parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 with biased values and recomputing the confidence levels .",
    "the technique described in this article also requires that the value of the test statistic is defined for each single - bin counting search channel , and that these test statistics may be combined to form a joint test statistic .",
    "more complicated test statistics which can not be separated into contributions from independent channels can not be used with this technique .",
    "a monte carlo approach is suggested in order to use such test statistics .",
    "the likelihood ratio test statistic of equation  [ likelihoodratioequation ] , because it combines multiplicatively , is well suited for this technique .",
    "special care has to be taken in the case that candidate events can have more than one interpretation .",
    "a single event may appear in more than one bin of an analysis or may appear in two separate analyses due to ambiguities in reconstruction or interpretation .",
    "the most rigorous treatment of such cases is to construct search bins which contain mutually exclusive subsets of the search results .",
    "for example , one may wish combine three counting channels , a , b , and c , and candidate events may be classified as passing the requirements of a , b , or c separately , while some may pass the requirements of both a and b , or both a and c , etc . in this case",
    ", one would construct seven exclusive classification bins , a , b , c , ab , ac , bc , and abc , and proceed as before . in general , if a combination has a total of @xmath0 bins , then there are @xmath72 possible classifications of each event if multiple interpretations are allowed",
    ". the nature of the analyses will necessarily reduce the size of this possible overlap problem , and only cases in which significant overlap is expected for signal or background events need to be considered .",
    "an efficient technique for computing confidence levels for exclusion of small signals when combining a large number of counting experiments has been presented .",
