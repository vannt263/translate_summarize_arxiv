    "the aim of these lectures is to explain how to apply controlled path ideas  @xcite to solve simple problems in singular pdes .",
    "the hope is that the insight gained by doing so can inspire new applications or the construction of other more powerful tools to analyze a wider class of problems .",
    "we discuss some problems involving singular stochastic non ",
    "linear parabolic equations from the point of view of controlled paths .",
    "to understand the origin of such singular equations , we have chosen to present the example of a homogenization problem for a singular potential in a linear parabolic equation .",
    "this point of view has the added benefit that it allows us to track back the renormalization needed to handle the singularities as effects living on other scales than those of interest .",
    "the basic problem is that of having to handle effects of the microscopic scales and their interaction through non ",
    "linearities on the macroscopic behavior of the solution .",
    "mathematically , this problem translates into the attempt of making schwartz s theory of distribution coexist with non  linear operations which are notoriously not continuous in the usual topologies on distributions .",
    "this is a very old problem of analysis and has been widely studied .",
    "the additional input which is not present in the usual approaches is that the singularities which force us to treat the problem in the setting of schwartz s distributions are of a stochastic nature .",
    "so we dispose of two handles on the problem : the analytical one and the probabilistic one .",
    "the right mix of the two will provide an effective solution to a wide class of problems .",
    "a first and deep understanding of these problems has been obtained starting from the late 90s by t. lyons  @xcite , who introduced a theory of _ rough paths _ in order to settle the conflict of topology and non  linearity in the context of driven differential equations , or more generally in the context of the non  linear analysis of time ",
    "varying signals .",
    "nowadays there are many expositions of this theory  @xcite and we refer the reader to the literature for more details .    in  @xcite ,",
    "the notion of _ controlled paths _ has been introduced in order to extend the applicability of the rough path ideas to a larger class of problems that are not necessarily related to the integration of odes but which still retain the one  dimensional nature of the directions in which the irregularity manifest itself .",
    "the controlled path approach has been used to make sense of the evolution of irregular objects such as vortex filaments and certain spdes .",
    "later hairer understood how to apply these ideas to the long standing problem of the kardar ",
    "zhang equation  @xcite , and his insights prompted the researchers to try more ambitious approaches to extend rough paths to a multidimensional setting .    in  @xcite , in collaboration with p. imkeller",
    ", we introduced a notion of _ paracontrolled distributions _ which is suitable suitable to handle a wide class of spdes which were well out of reach with previously known methods .",
    "paracontrolled distributions can be understood as an extension of controlled paths to a multidimensional setting , and they are based on new combinations of basic tools from harmonic analysis .    at the same time , hairer managed to devise a vast generalization of the basic construction of controlled rough paths in the multidimensional and distributional setting , which he called the theory of _ regularity structures _",
    "@xcite and which subsumes standard analysis based on hlder spaces and controlled rough path theory but goes well beyond that .",
    "just few days after the lectures in mambucaba took place , it was announced that martin hairer was awarded a fields medal for his work on spdes and in particular for his theory of regularity structures  @xcite as a tool for dealing with singular spdes .",
    "this prize witnesses the exciting period we are experiencing : we now understand sound lines of attack to long standing problems , and there are countless opportunities to apply similar ideas to new problems .",
    "the plan of the lectures is the following .",
    "we start by explaining `` energy solutions ''  @xcite , a notion of solution to ( a particular class of ) singular pdes which has the advantage of being comparably easy to handle but which also has the inconvenience of not having a comprehensive uniqueness theory so far .",
    "this will allow us to introduce the reader to spdes in a progressive manner , and also to introduce gaussian tools ( wick products , hypercontractivity ) and to present some of the basic phenomena appearing when dealing with singular spdes .",
    "next we set up the analytical tools we need in the rest of the lectures : besov spaces and some basic harmonic analysis based on the littlewood ",
    "paley decomposition .",
    "next , in order to motivate the reader and to provide a physical ground for the intuition to stand on , we discuss a homogenization problem for the linear heat equation with random potential .",
    "this will allow us to derive the need for the weak topologies we shall use and for irregular objects like white  noise from first principles and `` concrete '' applications .",
    "the homogenization problem also allows us to see the renormalization effects appear naturally and to track their mathematical meaning . starting from these problems",
    "we introduce the two  dimensional parabolic anderson model , the simplest spde in which most of the features of more difficult problems are already present , and we explain how to use paraproducts and the paracontrolled ansatz in order to keep the non  linear effect of the singular data under control .",
    "then we go on to discuss the more involved situation of the stochastic burgers equation in one dimension , which is one of the avatars of the kardar ",
    "zhang equation .",

    "the first issue one encounters when dealing with singular spdes is the ill  posed character of the equation , even in a weak sense .",
    "typically , the non  linearity does not make sense in the natural spaces where solutions live and one has to provide a suitable smaller space in which it is possible to give an appropriate interpretation to `` ambiguous quantities '' that are featured in the equation .",

    "we can then define products of suitable distributions and solve  ( [ eq : pam - intro ] ) as well as many other interesting singular spdes .      keeping the homogenization problem as leitmotiv for these lectures",
    ", we could consider also space  time varying environments @xmath850 .",
    "the scaling of the temporal variable is chosen so that it is compatible with the diffusive scaling from a microscopic description , where @xmath851 has typical variation in space and time in scales of order @xmath852 .",
    "assume that @xmath853 , then when the random field @xmath165 is gaussian , zero mean , and with short  range space  time correlations , the natural choice for the magnitude of the macroscopic fluctuations is @xmath854 .",

    "a gaussian computation shows that the random field @xmath762 , solution to @xmath856 ( e.g. with zero initial condition ) , stays bounded in @xmath857 as @xmath696 .",

    "the kpz equation was derived by kardar ",
    "zhang in 1986 as a universal model for the random growth of an interface  @xcite . for a long time",

    "the only way to make sense of kpz was to apply the cole - hopf transform  @xcite : solve she  ( [ eq : heat - intro ] ) ( which is accessible to it integration ) and set @xmath869 .",
    "but there was no intrinsic interpretation of what it means to solve  ( [ eq : kpz - intro ] ) . finally in 2012 , hairer  @xcite used rough paths to give a meaning to the equation and to obtain solutions directly at the kpz level . in section  [ sec : rbe ]",
    "we will sketch how to recover his solution in the paracontrolled setting .",
    "applications of the techniques used by hairer to solve the kpz problem to a more general homogenization problem with ergodic potentials ( not necessarily gaussian ) have been studied in  @xcite .      in  @xcite",
    ", hairer introduces a theory of regularity structures which can also be considered a generalization of the theory of controlled rough paths to functions of a multidimensional index variable .",
    "hairer fundamentally rethinks the notion of regularity .",
    "usually a function is called smooth if it can be approximated around every point by a polynomial of a given degree ( the taylor polynomial ) .",
    "naturally , the solution to an spde driven by say gaussian space - time white noise is not smooth in that sense .",
    "so in hairer s theory , a function is called smooth if locally it can be approximated by the noise ( and higher order terms constructed from the noise ) .",
    "this induces a natural topology in which the solutions to semilinear spdes depend continuously on the driving signal .    at this date",
    "it seems that the theory of regularity structures has a wider range of applicability than the paracontrolled approach described in  @xcite , but also at the expense of a very deep conceptual sophistication .",
    "there are problems ( like the one  dimensional heat equation with multiplicative noise and general nonlinearity ) that can not be solved using paracontrolled distributions , but these problems seem also quite difficult ( even if doable and work in progress ) to tackle with regularity structures .",
    "moreover , equations of a more general kind , say dispersive equations or wave equations , are still poorly ( or not at all ) understood in both approaches .",
    "as we have tried to motivate in the previous sections we are looking for a theory for pam which describes the possible limits of the equation @xmath870 driven by sufficiently regular @xmath236 but as @xmath236 is converging to the space white noise @xmath38 . from this point of view we are looking for a priori estimates on the solution @xmath29 to  ( [ eq : pam - eta ] ) which depend only on distributional norms of @xmath236 .",
    "so in the following we will assume that we have at hand only a uniform control of @xmath236 in @xmath871 for some @xmath751 .",
    "for the application to the 2d space white noise we could take @xmath872 , but we will not use this specific information in order to probe the range of applicability of our approach and we will only assume that the exponent @xmath873 is such that @xmath874 .    assume for a moment that we are in the simpler situation @xmath756 and @xmath875 and let us try to solve equation  ( [ eq : pam - eta ] ) via picard iterations @xmath876 starting from @xmath877 . since @xmath206 preserves the @xmath878-regularity ( which can be seen by identifying @xmath878 with the classical space of bounded hlder  continuous functions of space ) , the product @xmath879 is well defined as an element of @xmath880 for all @xmath59 since @xmath881 and we are in condition to apply corollary  [ cor : product ] below on the product of elements in hlder  besov spaces . now by lemma  [ lem : schauder ] , the laplacian gains two degrees of regularity so that the solution @xmath882 to @xmath883 , @xmath884 , is in @xmath878 .",
    "from here we obtain a contraction on @xmath806 for some small @xmath409 whose value does not depend on @xmath470 , which gives us global in time existence and uniqueness of solutions . note that in one dimension the space white noise has regularity @xmath885 ( see exercise  [ exo : wn besov ] ) so taking @xmath886 we have determined that the one  dimensional pam can be solved globally in time with standard techniques .",
    "when the condition @xmath881 is not satisfied we still have that if @xmath887 then @xmath888 by the standard parabolic estimates of lemma  [ lem : schauder ] .",
    "however with the regularities at hand we can not use corollary  [ cor : product ] anymore to guarantee the continuity of the operator @xmath889 . moreover , as already seen in the simpler homogenization problems above this is not a technical difficulty but a real issue of the regime @xmath760 .",
    "we expect that controlling the model in this regime can be quite tricky since limits exists when @xmath890 but the limiting solution still feels residual order one effects from the vanishing driving signal @xmath236 .",
    "this situation can not be improved from the point of view of standard analytic considerations .",
    "what is needed is a finer control of the solution @xmath29 which allows to analyse in more detail the possible resonances between the fluctuations of @xmath29 and those of @xmath236 .    before going on",
    "we will revise the problem of multiplication of distributions in the scale of hlder ",
    "besov spaces , introducing the basic tool of our general analysis : bony s paraproduct .",
