    "in ferromagnetic systems , modulated phases appear due to the competition between short - range exchange interactions and the unavoidable long - range dipolar ones . in the particular case of thin films with strong out - of - plane anisotropy ,",
    "this competition produces a stripe phase at zero field ; in this phase , parallel stripes with alternated out - of - plane magnetization are formed .",
    "these kinds of patterns are usually found in magnetic garnets @xcite and also in ultra - thin films , such as fe on cu @xcite . usually , in these systems",
    "a high out - of - plane field transforms the stripe phase in a bubble phase . under certain conditions magnetic garnets",
    "can also develop zigzags patterns and other complex magnetics structures @xcite .",
    "in the stripe phase , a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the film plane increases the period of the stripes stretching the thickness of the stripes aligned to the field and shrinking the stripes pointing in the opposite direction @xcite . in some of these systems , a significant change in the stripe period is observed when either the temperature or the magnetic field changes . using a smectic like model relying on effective local interactions energies such as bending and compression , sornette @xcite proposed the following mechanism for zig - zag formation . in order to accommodate the enhancement of the stripe period as the field",
    "is increased , the system has to eject lines , i.e. , domain walls , and this is conducted by the nucleation and climbing of dislocations . however ,",
    "when the field is decreased and the stripe period shrinks , the nucleation of a new stripe by edge dislocations is not observed .",
    "instead , the system develops an undulation instability when a threshold in dilative strain is reached ; a further decrease of the field transforms this sinusoidal undulation into a zigzag pattern .    in other systems with a reduced out - of - plane anisotropy , a canted phase can appear , i.e. , in addition to the stripes with out - of - plane magnetization , an in - plane magnetization component is present @xcite . in this canted spin configuration ,",
    "an in - plane field parallel to the stripes should induce a stripe width variation @xcite , however , this effect is difficult to be observed experimentally and hitherto there are few experiments @xcite showing the effect , aside from certain cases in which an oscillating field is needed in order to unpin the stripes @xcite .",

    "[ fig5:loops_w017d015 ] ) were obtained with numerical simulations , while the single spin model predictions for each case are @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "we see that the values predicted by the single - spin approximation for @xmath120 agree very well with the values coming from monte carlo simulations .",
    "this indicates that the chosen value for @xmath52 accurately describes the numerical data and that the single - spin approximation gives a good description of the transition occurring at @xmath120 and the appearance of the zigzag patterns .",
    "however , the values predicted for the saturation field @xmath126 do not agree with the numerical simulations .",
    "this points to the limitations of the single - spin model to take into account thermal fluctuation and also to the fact that dipolar interactions are not accurately described by an effective anisotropy when the magnetization is mainly in the plane .    summarizing ,",
    "the zigzag mechanism that emerges from the present analysis is a direct consequence of cubic anisotropy , which gives rise to two pairs of effective local minima that exchange stability as the field changes .",
    "for instance , the appearance of a bubble state depends on the ratio between the cubic anisotropy and the effective uniaxial anisotropy that takes into account dipolar energy contributions .",
    "the single absolute minimum at high fields transforms , as the field is decreased ; first , in two minima with the magnetization in the film plane , and then , by a further reduction of the field , in two minima with out - of - plane magnetization .",
    "close to the transition from two absolute minima in the plane to two absolute minima out of plane , the energies of these four minima are similar .",
    "the proximity between the energy of the minima allows the formation of bubble lines without paying so much energy , which in turn produces a reduction of the dipolar energy and the appearance of the zigzag patterns .",
