    "it has long been an open question whether young stars could be the agents of dispersal of their parent molecular clouds through the combined effects of their outflows @xcite .",
    "the answer to this question depends on whether the outflows have the requisite kinetic energy to overcome the gravitational binding energy of the cloud , as well as the efficiency with which outflows can transfer momentum , in both magnitude and direction , to the surrounding cloud .    for considerations of molecular cloud dispersal , addressing the question of the adequacy of outflow momenta",
    "has historically lagged behind determinations of outflow energetics .",
    "this is because evaluation of the available energy sources needed to account for the observed spectral linewidths in a cloud is adequate for quantitative estimates of outflow energies .",
    "however , in order to address whether the requisite momentum for cloud dispersal exists in a given case requires well - sampled , sensitive , large - scale mapping of sufficiently large areas to encompass entire molecular clouds .",
    "such observing capability has been beyond reach until the last few years , with the implementation of `` rapid '' or `` on - the - fly '' mapping capabilities at large - aperture millimeter telescopes .",
    "the fact that many outflows powered by young stellar objects actually extend well beyond their parent molecular cloud boundaries has been recognized only recently , with the advent of large - scale , narrowband optical imaging surveys that have revealed shock - excited herbig - haro objects at parsec - scale separations from their exciting sources @xcite and from equally large - area , sensitive , millimeter line maps that show parsec - scale molecular outflows @xcite .",
    "the millimeter line maps of parsec - scale flows have been almost exclusively confined to instances of single , well - isolated cases , due to the tremendous confusion of multiple outflows in regions of clustered star formation , such as are found in ngc 1333 ( sandell & knee 1998 ; knee & sandell 2000 ) , @xmath7 oph , serpens @xcite , or circinus @xcite .",
    "the l1448 dark cloud , with a mass of 100 m@xmath5 over its @xmath8 1.3 pc @xmath2 0.7 pc extent as traced by c@xmath9o emission , @xcite , is part of the much more extensive ( 10 pc @xmath2 33 pc ) perseus molecular cloud complex , which contains @xmath10 1.7 @xmath2 10@xmath11 m@xmath5 , at a distance of 300 pc @xcite .",

    "the class i source , l1448 irs 1 , lies close to the western boundary of the cloud , just outside the lowest nh@xmath6 contours in the maps of @xcite .",

    "due to its brightness , high - velocity extent ( @xmath15 70 km s@xmath13 ) , and symmetrically spaced co bullets , the l1448c molecular outflow has been the object of much study , unlike the flows from its neighbors , the 7@xmath4 ( in projected separation ) protobinary , l1448n(a ) & ( b ) , just 1.2@xmath1 to the north , or l1448 irs 2 , 3.7@xmath1 to the northwest ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "identification of these flows was aided by noting the position angle of the low - excitation h@xmath16 flow , centered on l1448n(a ) , to be distinct from the position angle of the co flow from l1448n(b ) , defined by the direction of the line joining l1448n(b ) with the newly discovered herbig - haro object , hh 196 @xcite .",
    "recent , wide - angle ( @xmath8 70@xmath1 field - of - view ) , narrowband optical imaging of the entire extent of the l1448 cloud has resulted in the discovery of several systems of herbig - haro objects , some displaced several parsecs from any exciting source @xcite . in order to investigate the link between high - velocity molecular gas and the newly discovered herbig - haro objects , as well as to study the possibility of cloud dispersal via outflows , we acquired new , sensitive , large - scale co j@xmath141@xmath30 maps of a substantial portion of the l1448 cloud .",
