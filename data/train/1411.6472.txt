    "scientists have suggested that mhd waves propagating on flowing magnetic flux tubes can become unstable as the flow speed exceeds some critical value , and the developing instability ( usually the kelvin  helmholtz ) might trigger turbulence which causes heating . magnetic flux tubes existing in the photosphere and chromosphere of the sun",

    "the ambient magnetic field is nearly vertical and often unipolar , and interacting with the emerging field gives rise to reconnection followed by mass ejections , with collimated hot - plasma flows commonly termed jets ( yokoyama & shibata 1995 ) . after the launch of _ hinode_/xrt it was discovered that these jets occur more frequently than previously thought , at a frequency of @xmath26 jets per day ( savcheva _ et al . _  2007 ) and 10 jets per hour ( as reported by cirtain _ et al . _",

    "the small - scale solar eruptions there also exist large scale solar mass eruptions called coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) , which are probably the most important sources of adverse space weather effects ( see , _ e.g. _ , howard _ et al . _  2006 ; zhang _ et al . _  2007",

    "very recently , according to aulanier ( 2014 ) `` no more than two distinct physical mechanisms can actually initiate and drive prominence eruptions : the _ magnetic breakout _ and the _ torus instability_. in this view , all other processes ( including flux emergence , flux cancellation , flare reconnection and long - range couplings ) should be considered as various ways that lead to , or that strengthen , one of the aforementioned driving mechanisms . ''",
    "studies using the data sets from ( among others ) the _ soho _ , _ trace _ , _ wind _ , _ ace _ , _ stereo _ , and _ sdo _ spacecraft , along with ground - based instruments , have improved our knowledge of the origins and development of cmes at the sun ( webb & howard 2012 ; joshi _ et al . _  2013a , b ; landi & miralles 2014 ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that cmes are the results of eruptions of magnetic flux ropes ( mfrs ) ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) . however , there is heated debate on whether mfrs exist prior to the eruptions or if they are formed during the eruptions .",
    "several coronal signatures , for example , filaments , coronal cavities , sigmoid structures , and hot channels ( or hot blobs ) , are proposed as mfrs and observed before the eruption , which support the pre - existing mfr scenario ( see , _ e.g. _ , cheng _ et al . _  2011",
    "; zhang , cheng & ding 2012 ; patsourakos , vourlidas & stenborg 2013 ; vourlidas 2014 ; green & kliem 2014 ; cheng _ et al . _  2014 ; chen , bastian & gary 2014 ; howard & deforest 2014 ; vemareddy & zhang 2014 ) .",
    "according to the second scenario , a new flux rope forms as a result of the reconnection of the magnetic lines of an arcade ( a group of arches of field lines ) during the eruption itself .",
    "observational support for this mechanism was recently reported by song _",
    "et al . _  ( 2014 ) .",
    "the authors present an intriguing observation of a solar eruptive event that occurred on 2013 november 21 with the aia/_sdo _ , which shows the formation process of the mfr during the eruption in detail .",
    "after all , the majority of observations support the view that , in at least some cmes , flux rope formation occurs before launch .",
    "thus , we are convinced to accept the expanded definition of the cme suggested in vourlidas _",
    "et al . _  ( 2013 ) : `` a cme is the eruption of a coherent magnetic , twist - carrying coronal structure with angular width of at least @xmath44 and able to reach beyond @xmath45  @xmath46 which occurs on a time scale of a few minutes to several hours . ''",
    "it is well - known that kelvin ",
    "helmholtz instabilities occur when two fluids of different densities or different speeds flow onto each other . in the solar atmosphere , which is made of a very hot and practically fully ionized plasma ,",
    "the two flows come from an expanse of plasma erupting off the sun s surface as it passes by plasma that is not erupting .",
    "the difference in flow speeds and densities across this boundary sparks the instability that builds into the waves .",
    "when the instability reaches its nonlinear stage , vortices might form , reconnection might be initiated and plasma structures might detach . a concise but very good exploration of kh instabilities in the solar atmosphere in view of their interpretation from observations we can find in taroyan & ruderman ( 2011 ) .",
    "a general review of the effects of fundamental parameters like magnetic field , shear velocity and wavenumber on the growth rate of the magnetic kh instability occurring in the solar atmosphere have been presented by cavus & kazkapan ( 2013 ) .",
    "considering two semi - infinite flowing magnetized plasmas , they studied the conditions for occurrence and non - occurrence of instability that are determined for the different values of magnetic field , shear velocity and wavenumber in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the authors obtained the critical values of shear velocity of @xmath47@xmath48  kms@xmath32 and magnetic field of @xmath49@xmath45  g , which are consistent with observations .",
    "kh instability and resonant flow instability for a coronal plume in more realistic geometries ( slab and cylinder ) have been studied by andries & goossens ( 2001 ) .",
    "they obtained an analytical inequality for the occurrence of kh instability and showed that the instability that will most probably occur in coronal plumes is due to an alfvn resonance of slow psedosurface ( body ) mhd modes .",
    "kh instability of kink waves in soft x - ray coronal jets and solar spicules ( in cylindrical geometry ) were investigated by vasheghani farahani _",
    "et al . _  ( 2009 ) and zhelyazkov ( 2012a ) , respectively .",
    "it was shown in both cases that kink modes are stable against the kh instability because the critical jet s speeds turned out to be far beyond the velocities accessible for considered jets  in particular , for the soft x - ray coronal jet that velocity must be at least @xmath50  kms@xmath32 , and @xmath51  kms@xmath32 for spicules",
    ". the critical speed of vasheghani farahani _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2009 ) was numerically confirmed and refined by zhelyazkov ( 2012b ) ( see also zhelyazkov 2013 and references therein)the updated critical speed is @xmath52  kms@xmath32 . a more careful evaluation yields @xmath31  kms@xmath32 , that velocity lies at the upper limit of soft x - ray coronal jet speeds ( shimojo & shibata 2000 ; madjarska 2011 ) .",
    "a major step in studying the waves and instabilities in magnetically structured solar atmosphere is the consideration of a twist of the background magnetic field .",
    "twisted magnetic flux tubes have been investigated for many years primarily in the context of tube stability or in relation to the mhd wave resonant absorption .",
    "magnetic tubes are subject to the kink instability when the twist exceeds a critical value ( lundquist 1951 ; hood & priest 1979 ) .",
    "oscillations and waves and their stability in twisted magnetic flux tubes without flow have been studied in the framework of the normal mode analysis in earlier works ( see dungey & loughhead 1954 ; roberts 1956 ; trehan & reid 1958 ; bogdan 1984 ; bennett , roberts & narain 1999 ; erdlyi & carter 2006 ; erdlyi & fedun 2006 ; erdlyi & fedun 2007 ; erdlyi & fedun 2010 ; ruderman 2007 ; carter & erdlyi 2008 ; ruderman & erdlyi 2009 ) .",
    "most of these papers deal with relatively simple twisted magnetic configurations : incompressible plasma cylinders / slabs surrounded by perfectly conducting unmagnetized plasma or a medium with an untwisted homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "erdlyi & fedun ( 2006 ) were the first to study the wave propagation in a twisted cylindrical magnetic flux tube embedded in an incompressible but also magnetically twisted plasma . in the series of papers by erdlyi and collaborators listed above there have been studied the dispersion relations of kink ( @xmath6 ) and sausage ( @xmath53 ) mhd modes in various more complex geometries and magnetic field topologies ( for details , see zhelyazkov & zaqarashvili 2012 ) .",
    "the only work studying the wave propagation in a twisted magnetic tube with a mass density variation along the tube is that of ruderman ( 2007 ) . with an asymptotic analysis",
    ", he showed that the eigenmodes and the eigenfrequencies of the kink and fluting - like oscillations are described by a classical sturm  liouville problem for a second - order ordinary differential equation .",
    "transverse oscillations of coronal loops have been studied by ruderman & erdlyi ( 2009 ) who explored the effects of stratification , loop expansion , loop curvature , non - circular cross - section , loop shape , and magnetic twist on the damping of kink waves due to resonant absorption .",
    "an extended review of alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere ( both in untwisted and twisted flux tubes ) was recently presented by mathioudakis , jess & erdlyi ( 2013 ) .",
    "one important question is how a flow along a twisted magnetic flux tube will change the dispersion properties of the propagating modes and their stability .",
    "it turns out that the flow may decrease the threshold for the kink instability , as was tested experimentally in a laboratory twisted plasma column ( furno _ et al . _  2007",
    "this observation was theoretically confirmed by zaqarashvili _",
    "et al . _  ( 2010 ) .",
    "the authors studied the influence of axial mass flows on the stability of an isolated twisted magnetic tube of incompressible plasma embedded in a perfectly conducting unmagnetized plasma .",
    "two main results were found .",
    "first , the axial mass flow reduces the threshold of the kink instability in twisted magnetic tubes .",
    "second , the twist of the magnetic field leads to the kh instability of sub - alfvnic flows for the harmonics with a sufficiently large azimuthal mode number @xmath54 .",
    "et al . _  ( 2011 ) also studied the equilibrium and stability of twisted magnetic flux tubes with mass flows , but for flows along the field lines .",
    "the authors focused on the stability and oscillatory modes of magnetic tubes with a uniform twist in a zero - beta plasma surrounded by a uniform cold plasma embedded in a purely longitudinal magnetic filed . regarding the equilibrium",
    ", the authors claimed that the only value of the flow that satisfies the equations for their magnetic field configuration is a super - alfvnic one .",
    "the main conclusion is that the twisted tube is subject to the kink instability unless the magnetic field pitch is very high , since the lundquist criterion is significantly lowered .",
    "this is caused by the requirement of having an alfvn mach number greater than @xmath55 , so the magnetic pressure balances the magnetic field tension and fluid inertia .",
    "the authors suggest that this type of instability might be observed in some solar atmospheric structures , such as surges .",
    "et al . _  ( 2010 ) in the zero - beta approximation , in cylindrical geometry , investigated the stability of azimuthal shear flow with a sharp jump of the velocity at the cylinder boundary .",
    "they obtained an analytical expression for the dispersion relation of the unstable mhd modes and found that fluting - like modes can develop a kh instability in timescales comparable to the period of kink oscillations of the flux tube .",
    "the kh instability growth rates increase with the magnitude of the azimuthal wavenumber and decrease with the longitudinal wavenumber",
    ". however , the presence of a small azimuthal component of the magnetic field can suppress the kh instability . in studying kh instability of kink waves in photospheric twisted flux tubes",
    "zhelyazkov & zaqarashvili ( 2012 ) have shown that the stability of the waves depends upon four parameters , the density contrast between the flux tube and its environment , the ratio of the background magnetic fields in the two media , the twist of the magnetic field lines inside the tube , and the value of the alfvn mach number ( the ratio of the jet velocity to alfvn speed inside the flux tube ) .",
    "they assumed that the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the tube is proportional to the distance from the tube axis and that the tube is only weakly twisted ( that is , the ratio of the azimuthal and axial components of the magnetic field is low ) . it was obtained that for an isolated twisted photospheric flux tube ( magnetically free environment ) with density contrast of @xmath56 ( the ratio of the surrounding plasma density to that of the tube itself ) , magnetic field twist of @xmath57 , and alfvn speed @xmath58  kms@xmath32 , can trigger an instability of the kh type of @xmath6 mode .",
    "any none - zero environment magnetic field slightly increases that critical jet speed for instability onset .",
    "et al . _  ( 2012 ) have shown that ion ",
    "neutral collisions may play a relevant role for the growth rate and evolution of the kh instability in solar partially ionized plasmas such as in , for instance , solar prominences .",
    "they investigated the linear phase of the kh instability at an interface between two partially ionized magnetized plasmas in the presence of a shear flow and found that in the incompressible case , the kh instability is present for any velocity shear regardless of the value of the collision frequency . in the compressible case , the domain of instability depends strongly on the plasma parameters , especially on the collision frequency and the density contrast . for high - collision frequencies and low - density",
    "contrasts the kh instability is present for super - alfvnic velocity shear only . for high - density contrasts the threshold velocity shear can be reduced to sub - alfvnic values . for the particular case of turbulent plumes in prominences ,",
    "soler _ et al .",
    "_  ( 2012 ) concluded that sub - alfvnic flow velocities can trigger the kh instability thanks to the ion  neutral coupling .",
    "zaqarashvili , vrs & zhelyazkov ( 2014a ) in exploring the kh instability of twisted cylindrical magnetic flux tubes in the solar wind have obtained that twisted magnetic flux tubes can be unstable to kh instability when they move with regard to the solar wind stream .",
    "it was found also that the external axial magnetic field stabilizes kh instability , therefore , the tubes moving along parker spiral are unstable only for super - alfvic motions .",
    "however , even a slight twist in the external magnetic field leads to kh instability for any sub - alfvnic motion .",
