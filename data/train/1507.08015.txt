    "recently , an interesting new approach for physical security in massive multiple - input multiple - output ( @xmath1 ) communication systems was introduced by dean and goldsmith  @xcite and called `` physical layer cryptography '' , or a massive @xmath1 physical layer cryptosystem ( @xmath4 ) . in this scenario , the channel state information ( @xmath5 ) is known at the legitimate transmitter as well as all the other adversaries and legitimate receivers .",
    "the eavesdropper has also the knowledge of the @xmath5 between legitimate users .",
    "the idea is to replace the information - theoretic security guarantees of previous physical layer security methods with the weaker complexity - based security guarantees used in cryptography .",
    "more precisely , the idea of  @xcite is to precode the information data at the transmitter , based on the known @xmath5 between the legitimate users , so that the decoding of the received vector would be computationally easy for the legitimate user but computationally hard for the adversary .",
    "the goal of this approach is to trade - off a weaker , but still practical , complexity - based security guarantee in order to avoid the less practical additional assumptions required by existing information - theoretic techniques , such as higher noise level in  @xcite and/or less antennas for the adversary than for legitimate parties in  @xcite , while still retaining the `` no secret key '' location - based decryption feature of physical - layer security methods .    in  @xcite , a @xmath4",
    "is presented that is claimed to achieve the above goal of the complexity - based approach , using a singular value decomposition ( @xmath2 ) precoding technique and @xmath6-pam constellations at the transmitter .",
    "namely , it is claimed that , under a certain condition on the number @xmath7 of legitimate sender s transmit antennas and the noise level @xmath8 in the adversary s channel ( which we call the _ hardness condition _ of  @xcite ) , the message decoding problem for the adversary ( eavesdropper ) , termed the @xmath9 problem in  @xcite , is as hard to solve on average as it is to solve a standard conjectured hard lattice problem in dimension @xmath7 in the worst - case , in particular , the @xmath10 variant of the approximate shortest vector problem in arbitrary lattices of dimension @xmath7 , with approximation factor polynomial in @xmath7 .",
    "for these problems , no polynomial - time algorithm is known , and the best known algorithms run in time exponential in the number of transmit antennas @xmath7 , which is typically infeasible when @xmath7 is in the range of few hundreds ( as in the case of massive @xmath1 ) .",
    "significantly , this computational hardness of @xmath9 is claimed to hold even if the adversary is allowed to use a large number of receive antennas @xmath11 _ polynomially larger _ than @xmath7 and @xmath12 used by the legitimate parties , and with the same noise level as the legitimate receiver ( @xmath13 ) . consequently ,",
    "under the widely believed conjecture that no polynomial - time algorithms for @xmath10 in dimension @xmath7 exist and the hardness condition of  @xcite , the authors of  @xcite conclude that their @xmath4 and the corresponding @xmath9 problem is secure against adversaries with run - time polynomial in @xmath7 .",
    "_ our contribution .",
    "_ in this contribution , we further analyse the complexity - based @xmath4 initiated in  @xcite , to improve the understanding of its potential and limitations .",
    "our contributions are summarized below :    * we show , using a linear receiver known as zero - forcing ( @xmath0 )  @xcite , an algorithm with run - time polynomial in @xmath7 for the @xmath9 problem faced by an adversary against the @xmath4 in  @xcite .",
    "we analyze the decoding success probability of this algorithm and prove that it is @xmath14 even if the _ hardness condition _ of  @xcite is satisfied , if the ratio @xmath15 exceeds a small factor at most logarithmic in @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "this contradicts the hardness of the @xmath9 problem conjectured in  @xcite to hold for much larger polynomial ratios @xmath17 .",
    "moreover , we show that the decoding success probability of an adversary against the @xmath4 of  @xcite using the @xmath0 decoder is approximately the same ( or greater than ) as the decoding success probability of the legitimate receiver if @xmath18 is approximately greater than or equal to @xmath12 , assuming an equal noise level for adversary and legitimate receivers .",
    "our first contribution implies that the @xmath2 precoder - based @xmath4 in  @xcite still requires for security an undesirable assumption limiting @xmath18 to be less than that of the legitimate receiver , similar to previous information - theoretic techniques .",
    "* as our second contribution , we investigate the potential of the general approach of  @xcite assuming @xmath0 decoding by the both adversary and legitimate receiver , by studying the generalized scenario where one allows arbitrary precoding matrices by the legitimate transmitter in place of the @xmath2 precoder of the scheme in  @xcite . to do so , we define a decoding advantage ratio for the legitimate user over the adversary , which is approximately the ratio of the maximum noise power tolerated by the legitimate user s decoder to the maximum noise power tolerated by the adversary s decoder ( for the same `` high '' success probability ) .",
    "we derive a general upper bound on this advantage ratio , and show that , even in the general scenario , the advantage ratio tends to 1 ( implying no advantage ) , if the ratio @xmath19 exceeds a small constant factor ( @xmath20 ) . thus a linear limitation ( in the number of legitimate user antennas ) on",
    "the number of adversary antennas seems inherent to the security of this approach . on the positive side , we show that , in the case when legitimate parties and the adversary all have the same number of antennas ( @xmath21 ) , the upper bound on the advantage ratio is quadratic in @xmath7 and we give experimental evidence that this upper bound can be approximately achieved using an inverse precoder .",

    "in fact , users @xmath67 and @xmath68 know the channel matrix @xmath69 ( via some channel identification process ) , while adversary @xmath70 has the knowledge of both channel matrices @xmath72 and @xmath69 .",

    ", one can ensure that @xmath68 s error probability @xmath103 is less than any @xmath107 .",

    "<S> , we show that if the eavesdropper uses a number of receive antennas much larger than the number of legitimate user antennas , then there is no advantage , independent of the precoding scheme employed at the transmitter . on the positive side , for the case where the adversary is limited to have the same number of antennas as legitimate users </S>",
    "<S> , we give an @xmath3 upper bound on the advantage and show that this bound can be approached using an inverse precoder .    physical layer cryptography , massive @xmath1 , zero - forcing , singular value , precoding . </S>"
