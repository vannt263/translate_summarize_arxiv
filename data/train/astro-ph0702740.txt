    "blazars are one of the most extreme classes of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , distinguished by high luminosity , rapid variability , high polarization , radio core - dominance ( and therefore flat [ @xmath5 radio spectra ) , and apparent superluminal speeds .",
    "their broad - band emission extends from the radio up to the gamma - rays , and is dominated by non - thermal radiation ( synchrotron and inverse - compton ) , likely emitted by a relativistic jet pointed close to our line of sight .",
    "this so - called `` relativistic beaming '' gives rise to many interesting effects , which explain most blazar features ( see the appendix of * ? ? ?",
    "the properties of misdirected blazars are consistent with those of radio galaxies .",
    "indeed , unified schemes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ascribe the differences between `` beamed '' ( i.e. , with their jets forming a small angle w.r.t . the line of sight ) objects and the so - called `` parent population '' to orientation effects . within the blazar class , which includes flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and bl  lacertae objects , these are thought to be the beamed counterparts of high- and low - luminosity radio galaxies , respectively .",
    "the main difference between the two blazar classes lies in their emission lines , which are strong and quasar - like for fsrq and weak or in some cases outright absent in bl  lacs .    as a consequence of their peculiar orientation with respect to our line of sight ,",
    "blazars represent a rare class of sources , making up considerably less than @xmath6 of all agn @xcite .",
    "therefore , previously available blazar samples suffered from small number statistics and relatively high limiting fluxes ( until recently @xmath7 1 jy and a few @xmath8 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 in the radio and x - ray band respectively ) . the small size of these samples ( @xmath11 objects ) implies also that the derivation of beaming parameters based on luminosity function studies , and therefore the viability of unified schemes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is considerably uncertain , especially at low powers .",
    "moreover , as our understanding of the blazar phenomenon is mostly based on relatively bright and intrinsically luminous sources , we have only been sampling the tip of the iceberg of the blazar population .",
    "for example , the best ( and only ! ) radio luminosity function ( lf ) of bl lacs is still the 1 jy one , which is about 15 years old @xcite .",
    "the situation is only slightly better for fsrq .",
    "@xcite have recently studied the fsrq lf and evolution using the parkes 0.25 jy sample , while @xcite had to use the @xcite 1 jy sample to study the epoch - dependency of the fsrq lf .",
    "( the fact that @xcite used a 2 jy sample for their review paper gives an idea of how slow progress in this field is . )",
    "this state of affairs , and the lack of a sizeable sample which includes both fsrq and bl lacs , has so far also prevented a specific test of the suggested possible evolutionary link between fsrq and bl lacs @xcite .",
    "the large majority of all known blazars have been discovered either in radio or x - ray surveys ( but see * ? ? ? * for a recent optically - selected bl lac sample identified from the sloan digital sky survey ) .",
    "previous work has shown that x - ray and radio selection methods yield bl lacs with somewhat different properties , especially as regards the frequency at which most of the synchrotron power is emitted , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of most radio selected bl lacs peak , in a @xmath13 notation , in the ir / optical bands , and these sources are now referred to as lbl ( low - energy peaked bl lacs : * ? ? ?",
    "by contrast , x - ray surveys select mostly hbl ( high - energy peaked bl lacs ) , whose energy output peaks in the uv / x - ray bands .",
    "the question of which of the two bl lac subclasses is the most numerous one has been a topic of debate in the past few years .",
    "this is not simply a demographical issue but touches upon the details of jet physics and the so - called `` blazar sequence '' ( see below as well as * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "in this respect , we note that @xcite and @xcite have recently demonstrated that , contrary to previous ( lack of ) evidence and the predictions of the blazar sequence , fsrq with seds similar to those of hbl , or hfsrq , do indeed exist , although these sources fail to reach @xmath12 values as extreme as those of hbl .",
    "one way to answer this population question is through relatively deep number counts .",
    "however , bl lac number counts are still based on samples put together in the early nineties and , therefore , at relatively high fluxes .",
    "furthermore , while the strong evolution of fsrq down to the ( still relatively high ) fluxes sampled seems established , the issue of bl lac evolution is still quite open .",
    "x - ray selected samples ( mostly hbl ) have generally shown indications of ( small ) negative evolution , i.e. , with sources being less luminous and/or less numerous in the past ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ; this result has been recently challenged by @xcite ) .",
    "radio - selected samples ( mostly lbl ) , on the other hand , have exhibited very weak , if any , evolution @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that no sample , so far , has studied the evolutionary properties and lf of fsrq , hbl , and lbl , within the same survey .",
    "deeper , sizable blazar samples , have started to be assembled in the past few years by us ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i and ii respectively ; see also @xcite ) and others ( rgb : @xcite ; rex : @xcite ; hrx : @xcite ; class : @xcite ; and sedentary : * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite for a review ) .",
    "some of these samples take advantage of the fact that blazars are relatively strong radio and x - ray sources and therefore use a double radio / x - ray selection method . ] .    in paper",
    "i and ii we presented the methods , most of the identifications , and some preliminary results of the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) , a large - area ( @xmath14 deg@xmath15 depending on x - ray flux ) survey which reaches relatively faint x - ray ( @xmath16 erg @xmath9 s@xmath10 ) and radio ( @xmath1 mjy , depending on declination ) fluxes . in this paper",
    "we present the radio number counts , evolutionary properties , and luminosity functions of blazars in the dxrbs sample , which is at present almost completely ( @xmath17 ) identified .",
    "there are various features that make dxrbs a unique sample with which to address various issues :    1 .",
    "dxrbs is currently the faintest and largest blazar sample with nearly complete identifications ; it therefore allows us to reach fainter and intrinsically weak blazars , thereby providing further tests of unified schemes ; 2 .",
    "dxrbs includes both fsrq and bl lacs _ within the same sample _ ; it is then possible to compare the properties of the two classes , including number densities , luminosity functions , and evolution , independently of selection effects due to different sample criteria and definitions .",
    "this is vital also to test the idea of an evolutionary link between the two classes ; 3 .",
    "dxrbs includes both lbl and hbl _ within the same sample _ ; this has never been achieved before and makes it possible to compare the properties of the two classes independently of obvious effects due to the different selection bands and methods , hbl being normally x - ray selected and lbl being typically radio - selected ; 4 .",
    "dxrbs reaches radio ( and x - ray ) fluxes faint enough to provide definite tests to the so - called `` blazar sequence '' @xcite , which posits an inverse dependence of @xmath12 on intrinsic power .",
    "this scenario not only envisions the non - existence of fsrq with seds similar to those of hbl , which are present in dxrbs , but predicts also a dominance of hbl in x - ray and relatively deep radio surveys , which , until now , could not be proven or disputed due to the lack of deep samples ;    the dxrbs survey and its selection criteria , the sky coverage of the x - ray catalogue we have used , wgacat , and the sample selection and identifications are described in   2 . in ",
    "3 we analyze the dxrbs completeness , while ",
    "4 describes the dxrbs number counts , and ",
    "5 discusses the sample evolutionary properties .",
    "we obtain the dxrbs luminosity functions in   6 , while ",
    "7 summarizes our conclusions .    throughout this paper spectral indices",
    "are written @xmath18 and the values @xmath19 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 have been used @xcite . to compare some of our results with previous work at times",
    "we have also adopted an @xmath22 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 ( empty universe ) cosmology .",
    "preliminary results on some of the topics addressed in this paper were presented by @xcite .",
    "the selection technique and identification procedures used for dxrbs have been described in paper i and ii . we summarize here our final sample selection , discuss the wgcat sky coverage , and present our sample definition and identifications .",
    "dxrbs takes advantage of the fact that all blazars are relatively strong x - ray and radio emitters .",
    "selecting x - ray and radio sources with flat radio spectra ( one of the defining properties of the blazar class ) is therefore a very efficient way of finding these rare sources . by adopting a spectral index cut @xmath25 dxrbs selects all fsrq ( defined by @xmath26 ) and basically all bl lacs , and excludes the large majority of radio galaxies .",
    "dxrbs initially was the result of a cross - correlation of all serendipitous ( i.e. , excluding targets ) x - ray sources in the publicly available _ rosat _ database wgacat95 ( first revision : * ? ? ? * ) , having quality flag @xmath27 ( to avoid problematic detections ) , with a number of publicly available radio catalogues ( the chosen x - ray and radio catalogues were selected on the basis of their large area and low flux limit ) . north of the celestial equator , we used the 6 and 20 cm green bank survey catalogues gb6 and north20 cm @xcite , while south of the equator we used the 6 cm parkes - mit - nrao catalogue pmn @xcite . for objects south of the celestial equator , where a survey at a frequency different from the one of the pmn ( 6 cm ) was missing when we started this project ( the nvss [ @xcite ] , now available , reaches in any case only @xmath28 ) , we conducted a snapshot survey with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 3.6 and 6 cm .",
    "this not only gave us arcsecond radio positions for our southern sources ( we use the nvss for the northern ones ) but also radio spectral indices unaffected by variability .",
    "note that the primary selection has been done at 6 cm , as the 20 cm catalogues are used to derive spectral indices .",
    "a second version of wgacat was released in may 2000 . in the course of the work on this version ,",
    "white , giommi , and angelini became aware of a problem with the coordinates for 345 sequences in wgacat95 , caused by an error in converting the header of the event files .",
    "this error caused an offset in the source declination up to 1 arcmin but typically less .",
    "the fraction of sources affected is very small , @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the pmn and gb6 correlation respectively . for objects satisfying our completeness criteria ( see   [ definition ] ) , no source was mistakenly included because of this error , while only one had to be added .",
    "the @xmath31 wgacat positional errors ( see paper i for more details ) range from 13 arcsec for the inner @xmath32 of the pspc field to 53 arcsec for the @xmath33 ring .",
    "the x - ray / radio matching was done as follows .",
    "wgacat was correlated with both gb6 and pmn catalogues with a radius of 1.5 arcmin , excluding however sources for which the ratio between x - ray / radio offset and positional error was larger than 2 for the inner region ( @xmath34 arcmin ) of the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) ( as for such relatively large correlation radii one expects a non - negligible number of spurious matches ; see   [ cross ] ) . in the northern hemisphere",
    "the resulting sample was then correlated with the north20 cm catalogue with a radius of 3 arcmin , as the positional uncertainties of the north20 cm catalogue are considerably worse than those of the gb6 catalogue ( 160 arcsec at the 90% level compared to @xmath35 arcsec at the @xmath36 level respectively ) , and the @xmath37 cm spectral index calculated . in the south we derived the @xmath37 cm spectral index from pmn and nvss data , summing up the flux from all nvss sources within 3 arcmin from the pmn position for @xmath38 , while we used our own atca observation to derive the @xmath39 cm spectral index for @xmath40 ( this slightly different criterion translates in an estimated loss of only three blazar candidates : see details in paper ii and also   [ definition ] ) . finally , we excluded from our candidate list the following sources : clearly resolved out by our atca observations , with @xmath41 , within @xmath42 from the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc , smc ) and m 31 , and within @xmath43 from the orion nebula .",
    "the sensitivity of the _ rosat _ pspc instrument , besides the obvious dependence on exposure time and background intensity , is a strong function of the position in the field of view .",
    "consequently , the area of the sky covered at any given flux ( usually known as the sky coverage ) is a complex function of flux .",
    "two basic factors are responsible for the off - axis radius dependence : 1 .",
    "the decrease of the instrument effective area at large offset angles ( vignetting effect ) ; 2 .",
    "the degradation of the point spread function ( psf ) with distance from the center .",
    "both factors can be described analytically by the following relationships which give the minimum detectable count rate @xmath44 in a pspc ]      where @xmath46 is the exposure time in seconds , @xmath47 the off - axis radius expressed in arc minutes , and @xmath48 the value of the local background ( counts / pixel / s ) . the dependence on @xmath46 and @xmath48 , in background limited exposures ( @xmath49 ) , is given by the factor @xmath50 while the reduced sensitivity at large off - set angles due to vignetting and the psf degradation is described by the exponential term @xmath51 $ ] and is negligible at low ( @xmath52 ) off - axis angles .    the form of eqs .",

    "( [ skycov1 ] ) and ( [ skycov2 ] ) are somewhat conservative since some sources can still be detected just below the threshold , but it ensures that the number of spurious sources and source confusion are reduced , so that wgacat can be used for statistical studies .    the wgacat sky coverage has then been computed simply inverting the sensitivity laws ( [ skycov1 ] ) and ( [ skycov2 ] ) for each field .",

    "the above defining criteria were met by 219 blazar candidates , of which 77 were previously known sources .",

    "4 ) . if our spectrum did not cover the positions of both these emission lines we have adopted for bl lacs ( i.e. , weak - lined radio - loud agn ) a limit of 5   on the rest frame equivalent width of any detected emission line , which is the same as that used for the 1 jy sample @xcite .    tab .",

    "this resulted in eleven sources with @xmath98 mjy , pspc offset outside the 13 and 24 arcmin range (   [ definition ] ) , and @xmath25 being added to our sample .",
    "we can then safely consider dxrbs complete for @xmath98 mjy and @xmath109 ( the region of the sky covered by both gb6 and north20 catalogues ) .",

    "also , for simplicity we included in our cross - correlation only sources with @xmath113 mjy in the area covered by the southern , tropical , and equatorial surveys ( @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) , which is the _ maximum _ declination - dependent flux limit for these surveys , and sources in the zenith survey ( @xmath116 ) with @xmath117 mjy , which is its limit .",

    "_ bottom _ : the integral radio luminosity function of bl lacs in two redshift bins ( dashed and dotted lines ) and fsrq in three redshift bins and at @xmath386.[blfs],width=359 ]    a few interesting points can be made : 1 .",
    "the different evolutionary properties of fsrq and bl lacs are visually apparent .",
    "namely , splitting the bl lac lf into two redshift bins is equivalent to a simple luminosity split , with the two lfs overlapping without discontinuity ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a similar result in the x - ray band ) .",
    "the fsrq lfs , on the other hand , clearly display an `` evolution '' , with the lfs in different redshift bins being shifted with respect to one another , as already discussed in   [ fslf ] ; 2 .",
    "bl lacs are @xmath1 times more numerous than fsrq , the former having a total number density @xmath387 gpc@xmath335 for @xmath388 w / hz , the latter having a total number density @xmath389 gpc@xmath335 for @xmath390 w / hz .",
    "this is not simply due to the fact that bl lacs reach lower powers , as the bl lac number density above @xmath391 w / hz is @xmath392 gpc@xmath335 , i.e. , a factor @xmath393 larger than that of fsrq above the same radio power , due to the fact that the fsrq lf is flatter than that of bl lacs ( @xmath394 vs. @xmath395 ) .",
    "the fact that fsrq are @xmath221 times _ more _ abundant in our sample (   [ counts ] ) is due to the fact that fsrq evolve , which means they are more luminous and their fluxes are `` boosted '' , and to our flux limit .",
    "bl lacs are in fact expected to `` catch up '' at lower radio fluxes , becoming the dominant blazar class below @xmath171 mjy @xcite ; 3 .",
    "all of the above , including the rough overlap between fsrq and bl lac lf in the @xmath396 w / hz regime , is in perfect accordance with the unified schemes of @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "namely , a scenario in which bl lacs are beamed fr is and fsrq are beamed fr iis explains the larger number densities , lower radio powers , and steeper lf of the former ( see also figs . [ lfblbeaming ] and [ lffsbeaming ] ) .",
    "finally , the observed lfs constrain a possible evolutionary link between the two classes .",
    "it has in fact been suggested ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that a `` genetic '' link might be present between fsrq and bl lacs , with some of the former switching from a short - lived , high accretion rate regime to a long - lived , low accretion rate regime .",
    "this would imply a decrease in the fsrq number density at lower redshifts , which is not seen and goes also against the evidence discussed in ",
    "[ evolution ] ( see fig . [ vevabanded ] ) .",
    "[ blfs ] shows in fact that the fsrq lf evolves smoothly to @xmath386 , while that of bl lacs has no redshift dependence .",
    "one could then infer that any evolutionary connection between fsrq and bl lacs has then to be limited and can not affect the bulk of the blazar population .",
    "one caveat , however , is that radio power makes up a very small fraction of the total , bolometric luminosity , and is also not likely to be related to the episodes of large accretion of cold gas discussed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have used a well - defined , complete sample selected from the deep x - ray radio blazar survey ( dxrbs ) to probe the radio number counts , evolution , and luminosity functions of blazars down to 5 ghz fluxes ( @xmath1 mjy ) and powers ( @xmath2 w / hz ) about one order of magnitude deeper than previously available .",
    "our sample includes 129 flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) and 24 bl lacs detected in the radio and x - ray bands over @xmath397 deg@xmath15 .",
    "great care has been taken in assessing the completeness of the sample and the effects of its double x - ray / radio selection , which are relevant for other on - going surveys as well .",
    "our main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "our number counts agree with previous estimates at higher radio fluxes ; the surface densities of bl lacs and fsrq reach @xmath398 deg@xmath399 and @xmath305 deg@xmath399 respectively at @xmath400 mjy .",
    "the two blazar sub - classes have different evolutionary properties .",
    "fsrq evolve as strongly as optically selected quasars , at least up to redshift @xmath3 , with evidence of no evolution and a decline in space density at higher redshifts for high - power sources .",
    "bl lacs , on the other hand , do not evolve .",
    "this is true also for high - energy peaked bl lacs ( hbl ) , at variance with some previous results based on x - ray selected samples , which had found evidence of negative evolution .",
    "fsrq and bl lac redshifts are also widely different , with the former covering the @xmath292 range with @xmath293 and the latter having @xmath294 and @xmath295 .",
    "3 .   the observed radio luminosity functions are in good agreement with the predictions of unified schemes , with fsrq getting close to their expected minimum power ( @xmath401 w / hz ) .",
    "the idea that blazars are radio galaxies seen with their jets close to our line of sight seems then to work also at relatively low powers .",
    "4 .   despite the fact that the large majority of dxrbs blazars are fsrq , bl lacs are intrinsically @xmath1 times more numerous , again in agreement with unified schemes . 5 .",
    "the observed relative numbers of hbl and lbl are different from those predicted by the so - called `` blazar sequence '' .",
    "the lbl / hbl ratio is roughly constant and @xmath210 in the radio band , instead of the predicted decrease down to @xmath402 at our flux limits .",
    "the opposite behavior is seen in the x - ray band , where a marked ( sevenfold ) _ increase _ in the lbl / hbl ratio is observed going to lower fluxes , instead of the slight _ decrease _ expected .",
    "the available evidence supports a scenario in which hbl are intrinsically a small minority ( @xmath4 ) of all bl lacs .",
