    "in recent years , the study of airy beams has attracted great interest in optics and atomic physics due to their unusual features such as the ability to remain diffraction - free over long distances while they tend to freely accelerate during propagation , this was showed theoretically and experimentally by siviloglou @xmath1 @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the origin of these strange features , explained by berry and balazs in 1979 , is due to a non - trivial solution of the schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics for a free particle and the caustic envelope overlapped by the superposition of a plane wave @xcite .",
    "these self - accelerating airy beams have also inspired prominent research interests and potential applications such as : optical micromanipulation @xcite ; plasma physics @xcite ; optical microscopy @xcite ; and , recently , the growing interest in the influence of optical vortices on airy beams @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the holography , which was proposed by dennis gabor in 1948 @xcite , enables the information of the amplitude and the phase of an object or optical wave can be recorded on a holographic recording medium . since the development of the laser in the 1960s , there have been several works of conventional holography that used a laser as a source of coherent light and holographic recording materials such as silver halide films , thermoplastics , and photosensitive materials .",
    "in addition to the conventional holographic method , classical ( or analogical ) holography , several others were proposed as computational ( or numerical ) holographic methods : computer generated holograms , when the recording or construction of the hologram is numerical ( cgh ) @xcite ; and , digital holography , when numerical reconstruction of holograms are recorded with ccd sensors of high resolution @xcite .",
    "additionally , the development of computers and electronic devices that are ever faster and are of higher resolution , such as ccd cameras and the spatial light modulators ( slms ) based on liquid crystal display ( lcd ) or micro mirrors ( dmds ) ; new laser sources ; optical systems and opto - mechanical devices which are also of excellent quality .",
    "this has enabled the experimental implementation of holographic systems of numerical and optical reconstruction of wavefronts of objects and optical beams possible .",
    "photorefractive holography has been presented as a promising technique for dynamic processing of record - holographic reconstruction and holographic interferometry techniques to analyze surfaces and optical wavefronts @xcite .",
    "this is based on the photorefractive effect , consisting in modulation of the refractive index via photoinduction of charge carriers and linear electro - optic effect in some semiconductor crystals with a particular features , the so - called photorefractive crystals ( @xmath3 , sbn , kbt , @xmath4 , @xmath0 , among others)@xcite .",
    "due to the fact that it is a process that occurs at the electronic level of semiconductor crystals with nonlinear optical properties , the holographic networks feature high resolution and short response time , making it possible to act as a holographic recording media that does not require chemical or computational processing for reconstruction of the holographic image and presents indefinite reusability @xcite .    based on all this , we present the experimental generation of airy beams via computational and photorefractive holography .",
    "the airy beam experimental realization was made by a setup of computational and photorefractive holography using a photorefractive @xmath0 crystal as holographic recording medium .",
    "the airy beams and airy beams arrays obtained experimentally are in accordance with the predicted theoretically ; and present excellent prospects for applications in optical trapping @xcite and optical communications systems @xcite .",
    "the solution for airy beams propagating with infinite energy can be obtained by solving the normalized paraxial equation of diffraction in @xmath5d @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the complex amplitude of the electric field associated with planar airy beams ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the dimensionless transverse and longitudinal coordinates ; @xmath10 is an arbitrary transverse scale and @xmath11 is the wavenumber of an optical wave .",
    "an ideal airy beam is immune to diffraction effects , but it possesses infinite energy making its experimental generation impossible .",
    "however , it is possible to obtain a finite - energy version of the ideal airy beam by modulating it with a spatial exponential function on the initial plane @xmath12 , that is , the scalar field in @xmath13 is given by @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the airy function and @xmath16 is a positive quantity which ensures the convergence of eq.[airy_finity ] , thus limiting the infinity energy of the airy beams .",
    "the scalar field @xmath17 is obtained from the huygens - fresnel integral , which is highly equivalent to eq.[paraxial ] and determines the field at a distance of @xmath18 as a function of the field at @xmath12 , that is @xmath19 this equation shows that the intensity profile decays exponentially as a result of modulating it with a spatial exponential function on the initial plane @xmath12 . the term @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the initial position of the peak at @xmath12 , defines the transverse acceleration of the peak intensity of airy beams and describes the parabolic trajectory .",
    "these results are generalized in @xmath22d taking the scalar field and what described the beam as the product of two independent components @xcite , that is : @xmath23 where each of the components satisfies the eq.[paraxial ] .",
    "thus , the initial field to @xmath12 is : @xmath24   \\label{airy_2d_finita}\\ ] ]",
    "with the development of spatial light modulators ( slm ) , the generation of special optical beams ( non - diffractive or diffraction - resistant ) becames possible via holographic techniques due to the ability to individually control each pixel in real time and its high fidelity of signal reconstruction in holographic systems@xcite .    using the fields that described the airy beams , eq .",
    "[ airy_finity ] , we built a computer generated hologram ( cgh ) that is optically reconstructed using a nematic liquid crystal spatial light modulator(lc - slm ) .",
    "due to their simplicity and the fact of not requiring high diffraction efficiency , we used an amplitude hologram implemented on a reflective spatial light modulator .",
    "the hologram is implemented using an amplitude function that consists in varying the coefficient of transmission or reflection of the medium as from the following amplitude function @xcite @xmath25 \\right\\rbrace   \\label{transmisso}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the amplitude and phase of the field complex respectively ; @xmath28 is a spacial frequency of the plane wave using as reference and @xmath29/2 $ ] is the function bias taken as a soft envelope of the amplitude @xmath26 .",
    "the implementation of a pixelated version of the transmittance eq.[transmisso ] on a slm presents remarkable advantages as to the precision , as well as the fact that the object beam and the reference beam are mathematical entities that are specified with versatility and precision .",
    "the plane wave of reference is off - axis and introduces frequencies that separate the different orders of the encoded field .",
    "[ arranjo ] shows the experimental holographic setup for the optical reconstruction process of the holograms ( cghs ) of an airy beam @xcite .",

    "a 4@xmath42 spatial filtering system , where a spatial filtering mask ( i d , bandpass rectangular aperture in the case of @xmath5d airy beam and circular aperture in the case of @xmath22d airy beam ) is placed at the fourier plane , allows selecting and transmission of the light from the signal spectrum generating the encoded signal at the output plane of the holographic setup , the field @xmath43 .",
    "finally , the transversal intensity pattern of the reconstructed airy beam is recorded by a ccd camera `` step by step '' along the propagation axis defined by the distance of propagation invariant finite of the airy beam .",
    "initially , we assume that the complex field that describes the airy beam propagating with energy finite in @xmath5d and @xmath22d is given by the eqs.[airy_finity1 ] and [ airy_2d_finita ] respectively . for the numerical generation of holograms we employ a software developed for cgh generation from the eq .",

    "[ arranjo ] were reconstructed optically by several airy beam types :    * first case * : for an airy beam in @xmath5d with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , displacing the ccd camera on the propagation axis ( z axis ) and capturing the images , it obtained the transversal intensity pattern in a different plane along the direction of propagation fig .",
    "[ transversal_1d_50_0.07_1 ] and [ perfil_1d_50_0.07_1 ] .",
    "the dynamic acceleration can be seen in the fig.[dinamica_1d_50_0.14_2 ] , where the trajectory parabolic is evidenced as a result of the term @xmath49 of the equation [ airy_finity1 ] , remaining almost diffraction free .    *",
    "second case * : in the same way , we reproduced experimentally an airy beam in @xmath22d that propagates with finite energy . for the eq.[airy_2d_finita ] and choosing the same scales @xmath50 and @xmath51 that correspond to a truncation factor @xmath48 we can see in fig.[2d_0,07 ] the behavior of the transverse intensity pattern in different planes along the axis of propagation where the beam is accelerated in the same manner along the @xmath52 axis in the @xmath53-@xmath41 plane .    *",
    "third case * : process of numerical generation of airy beam arrays in a single holographic reconstruction .",
    "thus , considering the fields that define the beams @xmath54 , we take the origins of coordinates spatially displaced on the plane transversal in the direction of propagation @xmath55 we generate a cgh and from the transfer of the holographic pattern to the slm it is reconstructed optically . for a set of @xmath56 airy beams in @xmath57 described by the fields [ airy_2d_finita ] and spatially displaced along the x and y axes , that is @xmath58",
    "using the field @xmath59 as an object beam to generate the chg , we obtained the holographic reconstruction of the matrix of 4 identical airy beams in @xmath22d with @xmath50 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 that correspond to a truncation factor @xmath62 , fig.[transversal_2d ] .",
    "the 4 beams are propagated along the @xmath18-axis and converge symmetrically at the same point due to the parabolic trajectory . in @xmath63 the beams undergo a deflection equal to the initial displacement @xmath64 . at this point , the intensity of the first central peak overlap forming in the origin of the @xmath53-@xmath41 plane a central maximum is well localized .",
    "for the first time to our knowledge , photorefractive holography is being used to generate experimental airy beams .",
    "the recording holographic in photorefractive crystal occurs via photorefractive effect which is a phenomenon where the refractive index of the medium is modulated by the incidence of a beam of light with spatial variation of the intensity .",
    "this modulation is given by @xmath65 in diffusive regime@xcite .",
    "the holographic reconstruction of a wave object ( airy beam ) occur in quasi - real time , where the optical reconstruction is made through diffraction of the reference wave by a hologram recorded in the photorefractive crystal , diffracted wave . in bto crystals",
    "we must consider the optical activity of the medium , this effect acts on the beam so as it propagates through the volume of the crystal polarization is rotated by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the coefficient of optical activity . if @xmath68 is the recording wave length , @xmath69 is the thickness , @xmath70 is the modulation of the incident interference pattern and @xmath71 is the angle between the interfering beams , the diffraction efficiency of photorefractive hologram is given by @xcite : @xmath72      for holographic recording medium we used the bto crystal @xmath73 , of the silenite family , in diffusive regimen with dimensions ( @xmath74 @xmath75 and electro - optical transverse configuration ) .",
    "this crystal has a lower band gap compared to other crystals , such as @xmath76 or @xmath77 , which makes it suitable for wavelengths in the red region , as is the case of the laser he - ne @xmath78 used in our work . for the record and optical reading of airy beams holograms",

    "[ arranjo_fotorrefractivo ] .",
    "the light reflected ( beam 1 ) is used as a reference beam and the light transmitted ( beam 2 ) is used as a object beam , the object beam ( airy beam ) is generated optically from the slm .",
    "the two beams propagating in the direction of the crystal arrive forming an angle of approximately @xmath79 .",
    "in addition , due to the optical activity of the bto crystal @xmath80 , the reference beam and beam object should incise on the surface of the crystal with a polarization angle of @xmath81 with the vertical for at its center both beams are vertically polarized and the interference pattern is maximized .",
    "this choice of polarization direction is made through the polarizing placed in the crystal input @xmath82 .",
    "the combination of the object beam with the reference beam generates a pattern of interference that modulates the refractive index of the crystal via electro - optical effect , allowing the recording of the hologram in the crystal .",
    "for the reconstruction of the hologram , the object beam is blocked and the crystal output is positioned a polarized @xmath83 that blocks the transmitted beam allowing the passage of the diffracted beam that contains information about the hologram , the holographic image . finally , the reconstructed beam is recorded by the ccd camera and transmitted for visualization , storage and processing in the computer .",
    "the interference pattern formed by the airy beam ( object beam ) and the reference beam are incident on the bto crystal surface until the space charge field is maximum and the holographic grating reaches the saturation level ( approximately 30 seconds ) .",
    "then , the object beam is blocked and only the reference beam is focused on the crystal , the reading process , which is diffracted reconstructing the photorefractive hologram and the diffracted beam reconstructed as an airy beam . * first case * : airy beam in @xmath5d with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",

    "the hologram is characterized by the same scales x - y and the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath85 corresponding to @xmath48 .",
    "the results of the optical reconstruction are shown in fig [ airy_2d_bto ] , where we see the evolution of the transverse intensity pattern on the propagation axis .",

    "third case * : process of optical reconstruction of an airy beam array in a single holographic reconstruction .",
    "using the experimental arrangement shown in the fig.[arranjo_fotorrefractivo ] , and the same way as in the case of the single beam in @xmath5d and @xmath22d , we reconstructed optically the holograms arrays recorded in crystal . in the fig [ matriz_bto_2d ] shows the holographic reconstruction of the transverse profile of intensity in different planes along the direction of propagation for an array of 4 airy beams when @xmath84 , @xmath87 corresponding to @xmath62 and spatially displaced by @xmath88 .",
    "we see that the airy beams reconstructed by a photorefractive holographic system are in great agreement with those obtained with the spatial light modulator slm and consequently with theoretical expected outcome . in the bto crystal",
    ", the process of recording and reconstruction occurs dynamically presenting a fast response time for the formation of the holographic network and a high rate of recombination for the quenching of it .",
    "thus , it is interesting to note that for the diffusion regimen and despite the low diffraction efficiency present in the bto crystal it was possible to reconstruct from the block of object beams the diffracted beam with a good contrast on the propagation axis .",
    "one advantage of the generation of airy beam using the photorefractive crystal in relation to the spatial light modulators is the direct generation of the airy beam without the need of a 4-f system , furthermore , the photorefractive crystals have a high resolution which is greater than any liquid crystal display .",

    "the photorefractive holography , the most interesting , presented results where the beams have the same non - diffractive properties initially obtained with the slm and with the theory .",
