    "the broadband spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of blazars are double peaked .",
    "the bump at the ir - optical - uv band is explained with the synchrotron emission of relativistic electrons , and the bump at the gev - tev gamma - ray band is due to the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering ( e.g. , dermer et al .",

    "the seed photons for ic process could be from the local synchrotron radiation on the same relativistic electrons ( i.e. synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) ; e.g. , tavecchio et al . 1998 ) , or from the external photon fields ( ec ; e.g. , dermer et al .",

    "we investigate the relation of @xmath10 to the @xmath126 with a sub - sample of 18 sources in our sample .",
    "the black hole mass @xmath126 of these sources are collected from literature and reported ( see table 3 ) , when more than one black hole masses are got , we use average value .",
    "the @xmath10 as a function of the @xmath126 is shown in figure 12 .",
    "we do not find significant correlations between the two parameters in high data ( @xmath127 , @xmath128 ) and in low state data ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 ) .",
    "the result suggests that the jet power weakly depends on the black hole mass for _ fermi _ tev bl lac jets .     as a function of the black hole mass @xmath126 .",
    "the meanings of different symbols are as same as figure 6.,width=302,height=226 ]    in figure 13 , we show that there is an anti - correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath131 with @xmath132 and @xmath133 , where @xmath11 is the electrons energy at the peaks of the sed . for the log - parabolic electron energy distribution here adopted , the @xmath11 = @xmath134 ( the peak energy of the distribution @xmath135 ) and are calculated as given by paggi et al .",
    "( 2009b ) , @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath11 and @xmath10 is consistent with the prediction of the blazar sequence ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ; ghisellini et al . 1998 ; celotti & ghisellini ( 2008 ) ; ghisellini & tavecchio 2008 ) and is usually explained as that the radiative cooling is stronger in more powerful blazars .     as a function of the @xmath11 .",
    "the meanings of different symbols are as same as figure 6.,width=302,height=226 ]      ) as a function of the changes in @xmath11 , @xmath1 , and @xmath0 .",
    "the straight line is the best linear fit with a slope , @xmath138 and constant , @xmath139 ( @xmath88).,width=302,height=226 ]    the seds of 14 sources in our sample are obtained the low and high tev states .",
    "there are several possibilities that could be invoked to explain the flux variation .",
    "1 ) it is well known that the electron energy distribution is influenced by several processes , such as acceleration , escape and cooling .",
    "it is possible that the evolution of the electron energy distribution leads to the flux variation .",
    "2 ) another reason to explain the flux variation is the change of the doppler boosting factor , presumably due to a change either the bulk velocity or the viewing angle .",
    "raiteri et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that only geometrical ( doppler factor ) changes are capable of explaining flux variation for bl lacs .",
    "3 ) in addition , the emission dissipation at different location in the jet also may cause the flux variation . since the value of the magnetic field @xmath0 is related to the location of the dissipation region . in this case , we expect to find that the change in @xmath0 value is related to the flux variation .",
    "we plot the changes in the flux density at 1 tev ( @xmath140 ) as a function of the changes in @xmath11 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 in figure 14 .",
    "we find a correlation between the changes in the flux density at 1 tev and the changes in the @xmath11 ( @xmath141 , @xmath142 ) , but no statistically correlations between the changes in the flux density at 1 tev and the changes in @xmath1 ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) and @xmath0 ( @xmath145 , @xmath94 ) are found , which suggests the change / evolution of electron energy distribution may be mainly responsible for the flux variation .",
    "our result is similar to zhang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and supports the research results of single tev bl lac , e.g. , zheng et al .",
    "( 2011a , 2011b ) investigated the rapid tev flare in mkn 501 and multi - wavelength variability in pks 2155 - 304 , their result showed that the flux variation is caused by the evolution of electron energy distribution .",
    "paggi et al .",
    "( 2009b ) investigated s5 0716 + 714 , mkn 501 , mkn 421 and found that the flares are directly related to acceleration of the emitting electrons .",
    "in this work , we have modeled the quasi - simultaneous broadband seds of 29 _ fermi _ tev bl lac objects by using a one - zone leptonic ssc model with the log - parabolic electron energy distribution .",
    "we obtain the best - fit model parameters by mcmc sampling method .",
    "then , we systematically investigate the physical properties of _ fermi _ tev bl lac jets .",
    "our main results are the following : ( i ) there is a negative correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 for our source sample , which suggests that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are dependent on each other mainly in thomson regime .",
    "( ii ) there are negative correlations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 for our source sample , which confirms the consistency of the model and is a signature of the energy - dependence statistical acceleration or the stochastic acceleration .",
    "we check the correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath5 , and find that they are significantly correlated .",
    "the result suggests that the curvature of log - parabolic electron energy distribution is attributed to the energy - dependence statistical acceleration mechanism working on the emitting electrons in _ fermi _ tev bl lacs .",
    "we do not find any correlations between @xmath0 and @xmath3 , which may be because the curvature of the electron energy distribution is related to the particle acceleration rather than to the radiative cooling process .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that because we use a `` static '' ssc code and do not consider the evolution of the electron energy distribution , so the effects of radiation cooling on the electron energy distribution are not really addressed in here .",
    "( iii ) by assuming one proton per relativistic electron and the jet power are be carried by relativistic electrons , cold protons , magnetic field ( celotti & ghisellini 2008 ) .",
    "we calculate the jet power in different forms and the radiative power in the stationary frame of the host galaxy .",
    "we find a size relation @xmath6 .",
    "the @xmath7 suggests that the jets are particle dominated in _",
    "tev bl lacs .",
    "the @xmath8 is consistent with celotti & ghisellini ( 2008 ) and means that the mean energy of relativistic electrons approaches @xmath9 in _ fermi _ tev bl lacs .",
    "then , we explore the correlation between @xmath146 and black hole masses with a sub - sample of 18 sources in our sample .",
    "there are not significant correlations whether in high or low state , which suggests that the jet power weakly depends on the black hole mass for _ fermi _ tev bl lac jets . and we find the @xmath131 , which is consistent with the prediction of the blazar sequence .",
    "( iv ) at last , we explore the cause of flux variation .",
    "we only find a correlation between the changes in the flux density at 1 tev and the changes in the @xmath11 , which suggests the change / evolution of electron energy distribution may be mainly responsible for the flux variation in our sample .",
