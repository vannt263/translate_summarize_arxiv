    "that is , prove that for any canonical cvf @xmath94 on @xmath4 , there is a vsf @xmath19 on @xmath68 such that @xmath370 where @xmath325 and @xmath20 is the cvf from the proof of theorem [ annulus ] .",
    "indeed , prove that for any combinatorial surface @xmath68 with @xmath40 having @xmath129 boundary components , then @xmath371 .",
    "we can perform similar constructions with the original stooges .",
    "the resulting cohomology groups are called the * de rham cohomology groups*. let @xmath372 denote the vector space of c@xmath268 scalar fields on @xmath4 , let @xmath373 denote the vector space of c@xmath12 vector fields on @xmath4 and let @xmath374 denote the vector space of c@xmath375 scalar fields on @xmath4 .",
    "we then have the linear maps : @xmath376 these cochain groups are , unlike the combinatorial versions , infinite dimensional vector spaces . nonetheless , as before we can form cohomology groups @xmath377 , @xmath378 , and @xmath379 as before and theorems from algebraic topology tell us that these vector spaces are isomorphic to the vector spaces @xmath380 , @xmath381 , and @xmath382 , respectively . the ambitious reader might like to try to prove this using the techniques from section [ section : refining ] .",
    "the following traditional result is the analogue of example [ annulus ] .",
    "let @xmath383 be a vector field on the annulus @xmath4 from theorem [ annulus ] . prove that @xmath384 but that @xmath20 is not in the image of grad .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath94 is any @xmath385 vector field on @xmath4 with @xmath386 , prove that there is a constant @xmath325 and a c@xmath268 scalar field @xmath19 on @xmath4 such that @xmath387 .",
    "consequently , @xmath378 has dimension 1 .      in the previous sections",
    ", we defined two types of cohomology groups : the combinatorial cohomology groups @xmath353 and the de rham cohomology groups @xmath388 .",
    "the inquiring reader is bound to ask several questions :    1 .   why are they called cohomology _ groups _ rather than , say , cohomology _ vector spaces _ ?",
    "2 .   where does the term `` cohomology '' come from and",
    "is there such a thing as a homology group ?",
    "3 .   how should all this be generalized to higher dimensions ?",
    "the first question is easiest to answer : just as our creation of the combinatorial cohomology groups does nt change much when we replace vector spaces over @xmath18 with vector spaces over some other field ( such as @xmath389 or @xmath390 ) , so it does nt change when we replace the vector spaces @xmath330 with abelian groups .",
    "if you know some abstract algebra , you might enjoy working through the constructions for the case when @xmath18 is replaced by @xmath391 or some other finite abelian group .",
    "the term `` cohomology group '' is derived from this more general setting .    to answer the second and third questions : notice that , in the combinatorial setting , we could also have created vector spaces as follows .",
    "let @xmath392 be the vector space with basis in one - to - one correspondence with the vertices of @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath393 be the vector space with basis in one - to - one correspondence with the set of edges of @xmath75 , each with a fixed orientation .",
    "finally , let @xmath394 be the vector space with basis in one - to - one correspondence with the faces of @xmath4 , each with fixed orientation .",
    "define linear maps @xmath395 and @xmath396 : @xmath397 by defining them on the given basis of the domain vector space as follows . for a face @xmath79 of @xmath75 ,",
    "let @xmath398 be equal to the sum of the elements of @xmath399 corresponding to the edges of @xmath4 with the orientation induced by that of @xmath79 .",
    "for an oriented edge @xmath82 of @xmath75 with initial endpoint @xmath77 and terminal endpoint @xmath78 , let @xmath400 be equal to the basis element of @xmath401 corresponding to the vertex @xmath78 minus the basis element of @xmath399 corresponding to @xmath77 .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath402 is the zero map and so we define vector spaces @xmath403 , @xmath404 and @xmath405 . the vector spaces @xmath406 are called the * homology groups * of @xmath4 and the vector spaces @xmath407 are called the * chain groups * of @xmath68 .",
    "the cochain groups are the dual vector spaces to the chain groups ( hence , the terminology ) and the tilt and whirl functions are the dual maps to the `` boundary '' maps @xmath396 and @xmath395 .",
    "this perspective suggests a way of generalizing the combinatorial setup to higher dimensions : if we have a so - called `` simplicial complex '' ( essentially a higher dimensional graph ) we can form chain groups and homology groups for the simplicial complex in strict analogy with the surface ( 2-dimensional ) case .",
    "the higher dimensional combinatorial cochain groups are then the `` dual '' vector spaces to the chain groups , the higher - dimensional versions of tilt and whirl are the dual maps to the boundary maps and the higher dimensional cohomology groups are quotient vector spaces . in the two - dimensional case",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath408 has the same dimension as @xmath381 .",
    "the higher dimensional version of this ( for objects called `` manifolds '' ) is known as `` poincar duality '' . any algebraic topology book ( such as @xcite )",
    "will have lots more to say about homology and cohomology groups for simplicial complexes and their generalizations .",
    "the best way of generalizing the de rham cohomology groups to higher dimensions is to develop the theory of `` differential manifolds '' and `` differential forms '' .",
    "many vector calculus texts ( eg . @xcite ) have a section on differential forms and more can be learned from books such as @xcite .",
    "the corresponding de rham cohomology theory can be learned from any differential topology book ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude this viewer s guide with one last challenge : for most of the article we have ignored divergence and its impersonator ebb ,    how do ebb and divergence fit into the theory of combinatorial and de rham ( co)homology groups ?",
    "can you prove a  coarse actor s \" version of the divergence ( or gauss ) theorem from vector calculus ?",
    "as is abundantly evident to those who know some algebraic or differential topology , apart from the presentation , very little of the mathematics in this article is actually new .",
    "we believe , however , that is is useful and pedagogically productive to draw explict analogies , phrased in the language of vector calculus , between the combinatorial and differential versions of cohomology theory .",
    "the article was spawned by the difficulty of finding a proof of green s theorem that illuminated , rather than obscured , the basic ideas , but still applied to a very wide class of surfaces and vector fields .",
    "it would be surprising if theorems [ mvtr ] and [ thm : cov ] were genuinly new , but we have not been able to find them in the literature ( although apostol s proof ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 11.36 ) is similar to theorem [ thm : cov ] ) .",
    "we also hope that this article will be useful to students encountering homology and cohomology for the first time and that the basic approach to green s theorem and scalar curl will be helpful to beginning vector calculus students .",
    "the third author has successfully used some of these ideas in the classroom .",
    "we thank otto bretscher and fernando gouva for helpful conversations and colby college for supporting the work of the first two authors ."

    "<S> the basic theorems of vector calculus are illuminated when we replace the original 3 stooges of vector calculus , grad , div , and curl , with combinatorial substitutes .    </S>",

    "<S> the classic episodes involving grad and curl include :    * : in this hilarious episode , we see that a vector field running in circles does no work if and only if it is a gradient field . * : nothing happens when curl hits grad who hits a scalar field . * </S>",

    "<S> we maintain that these issues are due , in part , to grad , div , and curl s excellent acting . with great aplomb </S>",
    "<S> they manage to combine ideas from calculus , geometry , and topology . in this viewer s guide </S>",
    "<S> , we show how the essence of each episode is clarified if we substitute the coarse actors tilt , ebb , and whirl for the good actors grad , div , and curl in each of the classic episodes . </S>",
    "<S> ( although , as we mentioned , we leave the episodes involving ebb to the true aficianados . ) </S>",
    "<S> these coarse actors merely approximate the good actors ; they are defined without the use of limits .    </S>",
    "<S> section [ scenery and actors ] describes the scenery , introduces the actors , and shows how the classic episodes can be reinterpreted so as to make the basic plot lines more evident . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to their simplicity , the episodes with the coarse actors have another advantage over the classic episodes : they do not have to consider the possibility that paths intersect infinitely many times . </S>",
    "<S> for example , letting @xmath0 for @xmath1 $ ] , the curves @xmath2 and @xmath3 are distinct smooth curves that intersect infinitely often in a neighborhood of the origin . </S>",

    "<S> section [ section : refining ] shows that , in fact , the only drawback to the knock - off episodes is their scenery and that by refining the scenery , the acting improves . in more conventional language </S>",
    "<S> : by taking limits we can recover the classic episodes from our approximations . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that the coarse actor whirl becomes the good actor curl and our imitation episode 3 becomes the actual episode 3 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , section [ cohomology ] , shows how the good actor s guild ( also known as de rham cohomology ) to which grad , div , and curl belong has a lot in common with the coarse actor s guild ( also known as simplicial cohomology ) to which tilt , ebb , and whirl belong . </S>",
    "<S> these labor unions organize the actors and clarify their working environment .    as always , there s fine print : to simplify matters , we work for the most part in 2-dimensions ( although in section [ cohomology ] we point to resources for generalizing these ideas to higher dimensions ) . also , there are various topological issues ( usually pertaining to the classification of surfaces and the schnflies theorem ) that are ignored </S>",
