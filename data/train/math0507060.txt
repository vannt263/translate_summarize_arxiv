    "note that this pair is not arbitrary .",
    "it has a property which we called _",
    "good_. a fredholm pair is good if ( roughly speaking ) it remains to be fredholm after conjugation with functions , see  [ good ] .",
    "these pairs act naturally on @xmath26 .",
    "nevertheless the concept of a good fredholm pair is not convenient to manipulate , thus we restrict our attention to the pairs of geometric origin , see  [ adm ] .",
    "we call them _ admissible_. they are the pairs of subspaces which are images of projectors which almost commute with the actions of the algebra @xmath21 .",
    "this concept allows to extract the relevant analytico  functional information out of the cauchy data .",
    "further a morse decomposition of a manifold is translated into this language .",
    "our paper is devoted to the study of the cut and paste technique on manifolds and its effect on indices .",
    "the spirit of these constructions comes from the earlier papers @xcite@xcite or @xcite .",
    "according to the topological and conformal field theory we investigate the behaviour of the index of a differential operator on a manifold composed from bordisms @xmath27 we think of @xmath28 s as objects and we treat bordisms of manifolds as morphisms . starting from this geometric background",
    "we introduce a category @xmath29 , whose objects are _ polarized representations_. the algebra @xmath21 may vary .",
    "we keep in mind that such objects arise when :    * @xmath21 is an algebra of functions on a manifold @xmath22 , * there is given a vector bundle @xmath30 over @xmath22 , then @xmath24 is a representation of @xmath21 , * there is given a pseudodifferential projector in @xmath23 .",
    "the morphisms in @xmath29 are certain correspondences , i.e.  linear subspaces in the product of the source and the target .",
    "a particular case of principal value for our theory are the correspondences coming from bordisms of manifolds equipped with an elliptic operator . precisely : suppose we are given a manifold @xmath31 with a boundary @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , suppose that there is given an elliptic operator of the first order acting on the sections of a vector bundle @xmath30 over @xmath31 .",
    "then the space of the boundary values of the cauchy data of solutions is a linear subspace in @xmath33 . in another words",

    "the riemann - hilbert transmission problem of the cauchy data across a hypersurface is a model for another class of morphisms .",
    "these are called _",
    "twists_. our approach allows us to treat bordisms and twists in a uniform way .",
    "we calculate the global index of an elliptic operator in terms of local indices depending only on the pieces of the decomposed manifold ( see theorems [ chain - ind ] and [ add+twist ] ) .",
    "an interesting phenomenon occurs .",
    "the index is not additive with respect to the composition of bordisms .",
    "instead each composition creates a contribution to the global index ( theorem [ strange ] ) : @xmath51 in the geometric situation this contribution might be nonzero for example when a closed manifold is created as an effect of composition of bordisms .",
    "one can show that if the bordisms in @xmath29 come from connected geometric bordisms supporting elliptic operators with the unique extension property then the index is additive .",
    "the contributions coming from twists are equivalent to the effects of pairings in the odd @xmath52-theory , theorem [ chain - zap ] .",
    "it s a good moment now to expose a fundamental role of the splitting of the hilbert space into a direct sum .",
    "the need of introducing a splitting was clear already in @xcite :    * it was used to the study of fredholm pairs with application to the riemann - hilbert transmission problem in @xcite * splitting also came into light in the paper of kasparov @xcite , who introduced a homological @xmath52-theory built from the hilbert modules .",
    "the program of noncommutative geometry of a.connes develops this idea , @xcite . *",
    "splitting plays an important role in the theory of loop groups in @xcite .",
    "* there is also a number of papers in which surgery of the dirac operator is studied .",
    "splitting serves as a boundary condition , see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these papers originate from @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we omit the technicalities and problems arising for a general elliptic operator .",
    "we concentrate on the purely functional calculus of correspondences .",

    "an equivalence class of the above relation is called a _ polarization _ of @xmath23 .",
