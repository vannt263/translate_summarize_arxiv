    "<S> scientists are always yearning for new and exciting ways to unlock graphene s true potential . </S>",
    "<S> however , recent reports suggest this two - dimensional material may harbor some unique properties , making it a viable candidate for use in optoelectronic and semiconducting devices . </S>",
    "<S> whereas on one hand , graphene is highly transparent due to its atomic thickness , the material does exhibit a strong interaction with photons . </S>",
    "<S> this has clear advantages over existing materials used in photonic devices such as indium - based compounds . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the material can be used to trap light and alter the incident wavelength , forming the basis of the plasmonic devices . </S>",
    "<S> we also highlight upon graphene s nonlinear optical response to an applied electric field , and the phenomenon of saturable absorption . within the context of logical devices </S>",
    "<S> , graphene has no discernible band - gap . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , generating one will be of utmost importance . amongst many others , some existing methods to open this </S>",
    "<S> band - gap include chemical doping , deformation of the honeycomb structure , or the use of carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also discuss various designs of transistors , including those which incorporate cnts , and others which exploit the idea of quantum tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> a key advantage of the cnt transistor is that ballistic transport occurs throughout the cnt channel , with short channel effects being minimized . </S>",
    "<S> we shall also discuss recent developments of the graphene tunneling transistor , with emphasis being placed upon its operational mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we provide perspective for incorporating graphene within high frequency devices , which do not require a pre - defined band - gap . </S>"
