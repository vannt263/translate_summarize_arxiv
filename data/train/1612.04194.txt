    "unless stated specifically otherwise , graph colouring is considered to be an assignment of colours to the vertices of a graph subject to certain conditions . in a _ proper colouring _ of a graph , its vertices",

    "hence , the vertex @xmath64 is not in a rainbow neighbourhood , since it is adjacent to two vertices having the colour @xmath40 and not adjacent to any vertex having colour @xmath42 .",
