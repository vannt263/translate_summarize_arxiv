    "@xcite showed the possibility of energy and angular momentum removal from a keplerian accretion disk by the magnetic field lines that extend from the disk surface to large distance . in the framework of infinite conductivity and self - similar model",
    ", they showed that the magnetic stresses can extract the angular momentum from a geometrically thin accretion disk , which helps matter to accrete , independent of the presence of viscosity .",
    "furthermore , they argued that such a mechanism is responsible for the observed jets / outflows from accreting sources , when magnetic stresses convert a centrifugal outflow into a collimated jet .",
    "the disk matter has been argued to be outflowing through the outgoing field lines .",
    "the time evolution of axisymmetric , weak magnetic fields threading geometrically thin , keplerian accretion disks with finite conductivity in a specific model framework was furthermore investigated by @xcite , however without considering possible angular momentum transfer by the magnetic field . on the other hand , in the presence of infinite conductivity , the magnetic field , in the same model framework which does not consider the contributions from the magnetic stresses ,",
    "would be kept on amplifying by the accretion of gas , till it stops the accretion ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite showed that the radially inward flow is possible for plasma-@xmath2 and prandtl number @xmath3 , in the stationary channel - type flows having small optical depth in the absence of turbulent viscosity , which also could exhibit electromagnetic outflows for smaller prandtl number .",
    "they showed that the large - scale field keeps drifting inward until a stationary state arises , when the magnetic , centrifugal , and gravitational forces become comparable .",
    "this furthermore reveals the flow velocity profile differing significantly from the keplerian profile .",
    "the idea of exploring magnetic stress in order to explain astrophysical systems was , in fact , implemented much earlier .",
    "for example , the solar wind was understood to have decreased sun s angular momentum through the effect of magnetic stresses ( see , e , g . , @xcite ) ,",
    "the proto - stellar gas clouds might have been contracted by magnetic effects ( @xcite ) . in the context of accretion disk , @xcite and",
    "@xcite showed that the energy is possible to be extracted continuously by electromagnetic torques and twisted field lines .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed , by a linear stability analysis of the accretion disks , that angular momentum is possible to be removed by the magnetic torque exerted by a centrifugally driven wind .",
    "the same authors ( @xcite ) also discussed that moderately weak fields can cause sufficient angular momentum loss , via a magnetic wind to balance outward diffusion in geometrically thin accretion disks .",
    "however , plasma-@xmath4 has to be much smaller than unity to explain the tendency of strong flux bundles at the centers of disk to stay confined , as seen in numerical simulations .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite showed , by solving the local vertical structure of a thin accretion disk threaded by a poloidal magnetic field , the shortcoming of launching an outflow and suggested for an existence of additional source of energy for successful launching of the outflow .",
    "however , observationally outflows / jets are mostly found to be emanating from the disk when it is in a hard state ( e.g. @xcite ) , which is non / sub - keplerian .",
    "note that jets appear to be highly heterogeneous with velocities ranging from a few tens of million cm / sec to the escape velocity from the disk .",
    "superluminal sources , however , appear to exhibit jet velocity around the speed of light ( @xcite ) .",
    "the jets are found in disks around stellar mass black hole sources ( e.g. grs  1915 + 105 ) as well as supermassive black hole sources ( e.g. m87 ) .",
    "therefore , most of the modern models describing outflows / jets from the accretion disks are based on sub - keplerian , advective model when the flow has a significant radial velocity , unlike the keplerian disk .",
    "for example , a class of self - similar , advection dominated solutions was proposed by @xcite , in order to describe bipolar outflows from black hole sources , e.g. sgr  a*. later on , such a class of advection dominated solution exhibiting outflows / jets was applied in many other contexts , e.g. core - collapsing disks and gamma - ray bursts ( @xcite ) , low - radiative - efficiency nuclei of elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) .    in a different model framework , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite described advective , sub - keplerian accretion flows in order to explain outflows , quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and spectral states in black hole sources . furthermore , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite described general advective accretion flows ( gaafs ) around black holes and neutron stars and showed the effects of rotation of the black hole on to the solutions .",
    "the last authors also included various cooling effects explicitly and showed how the solutions get affected by the cooling properties .",
    "however , all the above models were formulated in the framework of shakura - sunyaev @xmath0-viscosity ( @xcite ) , when the flows are assumed to be embedded with the plasma-@xmath5 .",
    "hence , the matter transport is assumed to be supported via turbulent viscosity , not by large scale magnetic field , unlike that chosen by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite showed that the transport is also possible in the presence of outflow in a 2.5-dimensional accreting system ; it does not matter whether the outflow is magnetic or hydrodynamic .",
    "note that outflows and even jets can also be formed in the absence of magnetic field .",
    "this is likely to occur when the flow is radiation trapped and the accretion rate is super - eddington or super - critical ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 2.5-dimensional accretion model , proposed by @xcite , will be complete if the effects of ( large scale ) magnetic field is included therein . in that case ,",
    "one presumably can explain outflow of matter plunging through the outgoing magnetic field lines more spontaneously , as @xcite did in the keplerian framework .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , so far there is no attempt to obtain a self - consistent set of advective disk - outflow coupled accretion solutions in the presence of large scale magnetic field , which has lots of implication to explain low / hard state of sources .",
    "this , however , has been discussed in some extent for circumstellar disks around young stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , without discussing the detailed solutions of all the dynamical variables .",
    "the present work steps forward in order to obtain such a set of solutions for black holes .    in various numerical set ups , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of accretion on to magnetized compact objects have already been explored .",
    "as examples , some of them considered axisymmetric systems in the presence of magnetosphere ( @xcite ) , some other aimed at investigating advection of matter and magnetic field in the turbulent / diffusive disks ( @xcite ) , when the field strength decreases due to reconnection and annihilation at a later time .",
    "other groups , explored general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) simulations of magnetically arrested accretion flows and outflows around black holes , for toroidally and poloidally dominated magnetic fields ( @xcite ) .",
    "they furthermore demonstrated the possible extraction of net energy from a spinning black hole via the penrose - blandford - znajek mechanism ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , there were radiation mhd / grmhd simulations of accretion and outflows around black holes , exploring three distinct flow phases including the radiatively inefficient phase which is similar to the flows considered in the present work ( @xcite ) .",
    "some of the mhd simulations investigated the reasons behind the variability in low angular momentum , underluminous accretion flows in the vicinity of a supermassive black hole ( @xcite ) . however , all these works , to the best of our knowledge , considered the cases when any viscosity to be arisen from magnetorotational instability ( mri ) leading effectively to the shakura - sunyaev @xmath0 viscosity ( @xcite ) .    here",
    "we plan to investigate , semi - analytically , the effects of large scale magnetic field , with plasma-@xmath2 yet , on to the advective accretion flows in order to transport matter , however restricted to the simpler 1.5-dimensions .",
    "therefore , we consider the flow variables , averaged over the vertical coordinate , to depend on the radial coordinate only . while the vertical equilibrium assumption corresponds to no vertical component of velocity , we choose the vertical component of magnetic field to be non - zero .",
    "although , in reality , a non - zero vertical magnetic field induces a vertical motion , in the platform of the present assumption , any vertical motion will be featured as an outward motion .",
    "nevertheless , whether it is a vertical or outward transport , our aim is to furnish removal of angular momentum from the flow via magnetic stresses , leading to the infall of matter towards black holes .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in the next section",
    ", we describe the set of magnetohydrodynamic / hydromagnetic equations , at the limit of very large reynolds number , as is the case in accretion disks , describing flow model .",
    "this is basically the set of navier - stokes equation , but in the presence of magnetic shearing stresses ( and lorentz force ) , magnetic induction equation , the condition for the absence of magnetic monopole , and finally the conservation of mass .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the numerical solutions of the set of equations in  3 and its implications . finally , we summarize the results along with a discussion in  4 .",
    "we describe optically thin , magnetized , viscous , axisymmetric , advective , vertically averaged , steady - state accretion flow , in the pseudo - newtonian framework with the @xcite potential . the choice of the pseudo - newtonian framework , for the present purpose , does not hinder any physics , compared to that would appear in the full general relativistic framework .",
    "hence , the equation of continuity , vertically averaged hydromagnetic equations for energy - momentum balance in different directions are given by @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 when we assume that the variables do not vary significantly in the vertical direction such that @xmath12 , when @xmath13 , which is indeed true in the disk flows .",
    "note that @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the degrees of scaling for the radial , azimuthal and vertical components of the magnetic field respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "the vertical component of velocity is zero . here",
    "@xmath16 is the conserved mass accretion rate and the corresponding equation is the integrated version of the continuity equation , @xmath17 is the mass density of the flow , @xmath18 the radial velocity , @xmath19 the total pressure including the magnetic contribution , @xmath20 the force corresponding to the pseudo - newtonian potential for rotating black holes , @xmath21 the angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath22 the viscous shearing stress written following the shakura - sunyaev ( @xcite ) prescription with appropriate modification ( @xcite ) , @xmath23 , the half - thickness of the disk , @xmath24 the entropy per unit volume , @xmath25 the ( ion ) temperature of the flow , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the net rates of energy released and radiated out per unit volume in / from the flow respectively ( when @xmath28 are the respective contributions from viscous and magnetic parts ) .",
    "we furthermore assume , for the present purpose , the heat radiated out proportional to the released rate with the proportionality constants @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , for viscous and magnetic parts of the radiations . @xmath31",
    "indicate the polytropic indices depending on the gas and radiation content in the flow ( see , e.g. , @xcite for exact expressions ) and @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the components of magnetic field .",
    "note that , the independent variables @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the radial and vertical coordinates , respectively , of the flow , expressed in the units of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the newton s gravitation constant , @xmath39 the mass of the black hole and @xmath40 the speed of light . accordingly , all the above variables are made dimensionless , e.g. @xmath18 is expressed in the units of @xmath40 . for any other details , e.g. model for @xmath41 , see the existing literature ( @xcite ) , when @xmath42    we furthermore do not consider the heat generated and absorbed due to the nuclear reactions ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is to emphasize that all the variables appearing in the equations are assumed to be their respective vertically averaged quantities .",
    "hydromagnetic flow equations must be supplemented by ( for the present purpose , steady - state ) equations of induction and no magnetic monopole , given by @xmath43 @xmath44 when @xmath45 and @xmath46 are respectively the velocity and magnetic field vectors and @xmath47 is the magnetic diffusivity . on taking the ratio of the orders of the first to the second ( diffusive ) terms in equation ( [ indt ] ) , we obtain @xmath48 , when @xmath49 being the order of the length scale of the system .",
    "hence , when the reynolds number , @xmath50 , is very large , which is the case for accretion disks , the second term ( which is associated with the magnetic diffusivity ) in equation ( [ indt ] ) can be neglected .",
    "however , this term can be rather important inside some localized regions in certain astrophysical systems due to subtle reasons .",
    "nevertheless , for the present purpose , for simplicity we will neglect this term throughout .",
    "furthermore , as @xmath18 and @xmath21 are assumed to be independent of the vertical coordinate , it is easy to check from the radial component of equation ( [ indt ] ) that @xmath51 ( and hence @xmath52 )",
    ". therefore , the azimuthal and vertical components of equation ( [ indt ] ) , at large @xmath50 , respectively lead to @xmath53 @xmath54 when the radial component of equation ( [ indt ] ) turns out to be trivial . subsequently the equation ( [ nomont ] ) reduces to @xmath55 because of the choice of very large @xmath50 ( ideal mhd ) , there is a perfect flux freezing in the flow .",
    "therefore , a steady advection of the vertical magnetic flux towards the center may lead to the decrease of @xmath4 , making it close to unity and further smaller , in a pure axisymmetric flow , even if the initial @xmath4 was high .",
    "hence , at some point , the back reaction of the field will inhibit accretion , depending on the geometry of the field lines .",
    "although the physics of this process is not captured by the equations above and we also do not intend to discuss such physics , we will show below in  3 the effects of higher magnetic fields , in particular the inner edge ( around the critical radius ) , in the entire flow structure .",
    "this is essentially to capture a situation after significant advection done with a certain field geometry .",
    "henceforth , we will also neglect the second term in the parenthesis of equation ( [ vert ] ) .",
    "the set of equations ( [ con ] ) , ( [ rad ] ) , ( [ azi ] ) , ( [ vert ] ) , ( [ tdss ] ) , ( [ ind1 ] ) , ( [ ind2 ] ) and ( [ nomon ] ) is essentially the modified version of the set of advective accretion disk equations in the presence of a large - scale magnetic effect , which are otherwise discussed in the literature in absence of it . generally , in order to understand the hard state of accretion flows around black holes , the flow is assumed to be purely hydrodynamic with the consideration of a turbulent viscosity arisen due to a weak magnetic field , i.e. mri ( @xcite ) . although , mri is a largely accepted idea , so far , in order to explain the origin of turbulence in accretion disks , there are some subtle issues with it ( e.g. @xcite ) including its applicability in colder disks .",
    "therefore , transport of matter in disks is much more transparent through magnetic stresses , if the flows are embedded with a large scale field .",
    "such magnetic stresses are considered here on the right hand side of the radial , azimuthal and vertical momentum balance equations .",
    "in addition , the magnetic heating due to abundant supply of magnetic energy and the annihilation of the magnetic fields ( @xcite ) , which effects may be small however , is considered in the energy equation such that @xmath56 however , the other related terms in the momentum balance equations are neglected , again in comparison with the remaining terms in the respective equations , for the purpose of the present work .",
    "therefore , even in the absence of turbulent viscosity ( @xmath57 ) and hence viscous stresses , magnetic stresses alone can help in transporting matter in the accretion flows .",
    "such a consideration of large scale magnetic field and hence transport via magnetic stress has , although been considered in circumstellar disks around young stars ( see @xcite for a recent review ) , not yet been considered for advective accretion flows around black holes .",
    "question may arise , if the magnetic field with plasma-@xmath2 is adequate enough to describe infall of matter in order to explain observation .",
    "we will show in the next section that the large - scale magnetic field , even with a significantly large plasma-@xmath4 , can describe advective accretion flows as efficiently as an @xmath0 does .",
    "we have seven equations ( excluding the vertical momentum balance equation , which assures the vertical magnetostatic balance ) and seven variables : @xmath58 , which we plan to solve along with the vertical magnetostatic balance condition .",
    "first , we plan to reduce @xmath59 in terms of other variables and the independent variable @xmath35 alone ( without any other derivatives ) , given by @xmath60\\right)+\\frac{\\gamma_3 - 1 } { 2\\vartheta\\gamma_1 p}\\left[\\frac{\\alpha f_{vis}(p+\\vartheta^2\\rho)\\lambda}{x^2}+ \\frac{3f_m|\\vec{b}|^2\\vartheta}{16\\pi x}\\right]}{\\frac{1}{\\vartheta } -\\frac{\\vartheta\\rho}{2p}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\gamma_1}\\right)}. \\label{dvdx}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as the advective accretion around black holes is necessarily transonic , the flow must pass through a critical radius where @xmath61 when the variables with subscript ` c ' indicate the respective values at that critical radius and the numerator of equation ( [ dvdx ] ) has to be zero for a continuous solution . at the critical radius",
    ", we also prescribe @xmath62 so that the alfvn velocity is a fraction of sound speed therein .",
    "although this is a simpler prescription , other choices do not change the picture , being addressed in this work , qualitatively .",
    "note that a steady mhd flow would normally have three critical points ",
    "fast magnetosonic point , alfvn point and slow magnetosonic point  of which the alfvn point is not a true critical point ( @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining two physically important distinct critical points , corresponding to fast and slow magnetosonic waves , collapse into a single point because of the assumptions made in equation ( [ bcr ] ) .",
    "we typically choose @xmath63 in our various computations ( see the figures ) .",
    "this is to capture a situation when magnetic pressure at the inner edge of the flow is not high enough to hinder radial infall of the matter , i.e. a situation with a weak back reaction of magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , from equation ( [ nomon ] ) , we can write @xmath64 which fixes the profile of @xmath32 throughout the flow .    these four conditions , along with the conditions that @xmath65 ( when @xmath66 being the keplerian angular momentum per unit mass ) and @xmath67 at the beginning of sub - keplerian flow far away from the black hole , i.e. outer boundary , and @xmath68 at @xmath69 serve as important boundary conditions . based on all the conditions , by solving the set of seven coupled differential equations , we can obtain the profiles for all variables including those of @xmath70 and @xmath34 . of course , then , one has to supply @xmath39 , @xmath16 , @xmath0 , @xmath71 and hence @xmath72 and @xmath73 for a flow .",
    "see @xcite for the solution procedure in details .",
    "our main aim is to obtain the solutions of magnetized accretion flows . in other words , the aim is to understand how the large scale magnetic field ( alone ) can influence the mass transfer in accretion process , in particular in the the advective regime .",
    "this is important in the light of our ignorance of the origin of viscosity in accretion flows , which may be arisen from turbulence , as the molecular viscosity therein is well - known to be insignificant .",
    "hence , our venture here is to investigate , if the large - scale magnetic field , however with large plasma-@xmath4 , can govern the same / similar transport of angular momentum as the well - known @xmath0-prescription does .",
    "hence , we plan to understand the relative strengths between the magnetic stress tensors and the viscous stress tensors in order to control advective accretion flows .",
    "our plan is to explore specifically two situations .",
    "( 1 ) flows with a relatively higher @xmath16 and , hence , lower @xmath71 , modelled around stellar mass black holes : such flows may or may not form keplerian accretion disks .",
    "( 2 ) flows with a lower @xmath16 and , hence , higher @xmath71 , modelled around supermassive black holes : such flows are necessarily hot gas dominated advective ( or advection dominated ) accretion flows .",
    "we choose @xmath74 and @xmath75 , when @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the solar mass and the eddington accretion rate respectively .",
    "however , this choice of @xmath16 does not necessarily imply the flow to be purely keplerian , rather advective , which is indeed , in general , under consideration .",
    "such flows have temperature @xmath78k and @xmath79gm / cc ( @xcite ) , which were extensively explored in the context of the formation of shock in hot accretion disks and subsequent outflows and observed spectral states ( @xcite ) .",
    "a relation of @xmath71 ( and @xmath16 ) with the ratio of the gas and radiation content of the flow and the corresponding variations have been discussed by @xcite .",
    "therefore , following previous authors and for the convenience of comparison of the previous results without magnetic fields , we choose @xmath80 along with the intermediate @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "note that while the results depend on the sign of @xmath81 , they do not depend on @xmath82 and @xmath15 .",
    "figure [ stmasm ] compares accretion flows ( 1 ) in the presence of large scale magnetic field , but in the absence of @xmath0-viscosity : magnetic flow , and ( 2 ) in the presence of viscosity , but in the absence of large scale magnetic field : viscous flow .",
    "here we consider @xmath33 to have the same direction as of @xmath21 .",
    "it shows that the large scale magnetic field @xmath83 g , with its distribution in the inner edge of the flow defined by equation ( [ bcr ] ) , is adequately able to transport angular momentum , as viscous flows do with @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively for nonrotating and rotating black holes .",
    "figures [ stmasm]a , b show that the disk sizes are the same for the respective viscous and magnetic sub - keplerian flows with the above mentioned respective @xmath0-s",
    ". however , the transport of angular momentum takes place faster in magnetic flows , where the flows become quasi - spherical at larger radii than at the radii they become in the respective viscous flows .",
    "away from the black hole , @xmath33 increases , which implies that the matter is prone to outflow from the outer region through the magnetic field lines extended outward direction . in a self - consistent model , including the flow variation in the vertical direction , the above features should have been appeared as the increasing magnetic field with the vertical coordinate .",
    "such a model is planned to develop in future . in the present @xmath86-dimensional magnetic flow model , when the magnetic stresses play the main role to remove angular momentum and hence to overcome the centrifugal barrier , as matter advances towards the black hole , the magnetic field decreases .",
    "note that , as shown in figs . [ stmasm]b , d , @xmath21 and @xmath87 both decrease towards the black hole : to overcome large @xmath21 , the flow needs a large @xmath87 and vice verse  they are the self - consistent solutions to each other .",
    "note furthermore that the negative sign in @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ stmasm](d ) is due to our choice of decreasing @xmath33 with increasing @xmath36 , i.e. negative @xmath81 , in the outer edge of the flow ( which results in the same trend of the flow almost throughput , except very inner region ) .",
    "figure [ stmasm](c ) shows that our chosen regime of magnetic flows , allowing a steady infall of matter , corresponds to a relatively high plasma-@xmath4 ( actually inverse of @xmath4 in shown ) .",
    "this furthermore renders lower magnetic pressures in respective flows compared to their maximum allowed values based on the virial theorem / equipartition principle .",
    "as discussed in the previous works ( e.g. @xcite ) , a strong centrifugal effect is depicted in the mach number profiles in fig .",
    "[ stmasm]a ( featured as slowing down the matter at around @xmath88 ) in the high angular momentum flows around nonrotating black holes , compared to the low angular momentum flows around rotating black holes .",
    "now we hypothesize that @xmath33 increases with the increasing @xmath36 , i.e. positive @xmath81 , at the outer edge of the flow ( which results in the same trend of the flow almost throughout , except very inner region ) . in this case , the right hand side of equation ( [ azi ] ) , for a magnetic flow , completely flips sign compared to the negative @xmath81 case .",
    "figure [ stmasp ] shows that as the matter infalls , the toroidal component of magnetic field slows down the azimuthal motion of matter faster , making @xmath89 and , subsequently , inverting the orientation of @xmath21 .",
    "this is effectively due to the change in signs of magnetic stress components : @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "figure [ stmasp]b shows the variation of the magnitude of @xmath21 , as the matter falls in .",
    "@xmath21 is positive far away from the black hole , but it is negative close to the black hole .",
    "the location around @xmath89 reveals a trough - like region in the flow .",
    "hence , in the either sides of @xmath89 , there is a stronger centrifugal barrier which stores matter around @xmath89 ( due to the competition between radial and azimuthal flows ) .",
    "this region is prone to kick the matter out , producing outflows .",
    "hence , if @xmath33 increases with @xmath36 in the flow to start with , then as matter advances towards the black hole , a  potential well \" forms to produce outflows .",
    "note , however , that very close to a rotating black hole , matter will be under the influence of the black hole completely and hence @xmath21 can not have an opposite sign with respect to that of the black hole . therefore",
    ", this solution is not valid very close to the rotating black hole .",
    "indeed , the pseudo - newtonian description is not applicable very close to the black hole .",
    "nevertheless , the above solution implies a possibility of having such an origin of outflows in a magnetized accretion flow in the presence of a finite conductivity ( when the field is not frozen with the matter , when the term associated with magnetic diffusivity in the induction equation is retained ) .",
    "note that the plasma-@xmath2 is maintained throughout the flows .",
    "this furthermore motivates us to check with such a possibility in viscous flows with viscosities @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively for nonrotating and rotating black holes . as shown in figs .",
    "[ stmasp]a , b , the angular momentum profiles in the respective magnetic and viscous flows appear to be similar , which furthermore makes the respective radial velocity profiles similar , unlike the previous cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ stmasm ] , with the positive @xmath21 throughout . in the previous cases ,",
    "the magnetic stresses are able to remove the angular momentum faster than the viscous stresses , in particular at a large distance from a schwarzschild black hole , which is clearly understood from figs .",
    "[ stmasm]a , b .",
    "although the same is true for a kerr black hole , as the disk angular momentum itself is lower there , it does not effectively create any impact on the mach number profiles .",
    "however , due to the choice of larger @xmath0 , in the counterrotating cases , viscous stresses appear to be almost equivalent to the magnetic stresses and hence the radial velocity profiles in either of the respective flows appear similar .",
    "let us now understand in more details , how the various components of magnetic stress are responsible for inflow and/or angular momentum transfer therein .",
    "figures [ bcomp]a , b show the variations of various components of the magnetic field as functions of the radial coordinate , around schwarzschild and kerr black holes , which are responsible for the various components of magnetic stress tensor .",
    "the profiles of field components and their magnitudes are partly dependent on their prescription given by equation ( [ bcr ] ) .",
    "figure [ stmasstr]a shows that the stress tensor component @xmath94 around a schwarzschild black hole increases almost throughout as matter advances towards the black hole .",
    "this implies that the flow is prone to outflow through the field lines , which indirectly helps in removing the angular momentum , which furthermore renders its infall towards the black hole .",
    "however , very close to the black hole , @xmath94 decreases , as indeed outflow is not possible in the near vicinity of the back hole , in particular , once the matter passes through the ( inner ) sonic point . by this radius ,",
    "the flow angular momentum becomes very small which practically does not affect the infall .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath95 decreases till the inner region of accretion flow , implying the matter to be spiralling out and hence removing the angular momentum .",
    "a larger @xmath96 at a larger radius implies a requirement of the removal of larger @xmath21 therein .",
    "this automatically emerges from the self - consistent solutions of the set of equations . nevertheless , close to the black hole , this effect reverses , rendering infall .",
    "finally , the magnitude of @xmath97 increases at a large and a small distances from the black hole ( except around the transition radius ) , which helps infall , in the same way as the shakura - sunyaev viscous stress would do with the increase of matter pressure .",
    "however , at the intermediate zone , the transfer of angular momentum through @xmath97 reverses and a part of the matter outflows . at the keplerian to sub - keplerian transition zone , flow / disk thickness increases , which effectively kicks the matter vertically , showing a decrease of @xmath97 .",
    "most of these features remain unchanged for the flow around a rotating black hole , as shown in fig .",
    "[ stmasstr]b .",
    "however , as a rotating black hole renders a stronger / efficient outflow / jet , here , except at the inner zone , @xmath97 decreases throughout , which helps transferring the angular momentum inwards and kicking the matter outwards .",
    "nevertheless , such a flow does not exhibit a high @xmath21 either so that does not necessarily require an increasing @xmath97 to remove @xmath21 .",
    "figures [ stmasstr]c , d furthermore confirm that the above properties are invariant for the cases of @xmath33 increased with increasing @xmath36 .",
    "the only difference here is that @xmath97 and @xmath95 have opposite signs with respect to the previous cases , when the components of magnetic field considered here are their respective averaged values .",
    "note that all the components of magnetic stress tensor as functions of radius are determined by the associated components of magnetic field .",
    "the components of magnetic field are , however , determined by solving the underlying set of equations self - consistently with their prescription at the inner edge of the flow for the regime of interest .",

    "( 1 ) a counter rotating disk throughout , when @xmath33 decreases with @xmath36 almost throughout ( solid line ) . ( 2 ) a disk having @xmath33 increasing with @xmath36 almost throughout , which is corotating far away , but counterrotating close to the black hole ( dotted line ) .",
    "( 3 ) a disk having @xmath33 increasing with @xmath36 almost throughout , which is counterrotating far away , but corotating close to the black hole ( dashed line ) .",
    "note importantly in the latter two cases that the increasing @xmath33 with disk height induces the change of handedness of the disk during the infall of matter .",
    "however , the profiles of mach number and @xmath4 practically appear similar in all the three cases .        in fig .",
    "[ stmascom ] , we compare the disk hydrodynamics between the magnetic flows with high and low magnetic fields .",
    "as expected , a flow with the higher magnetic field transports the angular momentum much faster , leading to a smaller sub - keplerian flow .",
    "in other words , in the presence of a higher magnetic field , when the magnetic stresses are stronger , the keplerian flow ( when @xmath65 ) as well as the boundary between the keplerian and sub - keplerian flows are able to advance towards the black hole , shrinking the sub - keplerian zone because of efficient angular momentum transfer .",
    "figure [ stmascom]c shows that at a given radius the magnetic pressure , and hence the alfvn speed , is much larger in a flow with the higher magnetic field ( but still @xmath2 ) .",
    "naturally , such a high field magnetic flow would be equivalent to a viscous flow with much larger @xmath0 , compared to the cases shown in fig .",
    "[ stmasm ] .",
    "an even higher magnetic field in the inner region would hinder any infall due to backreactions .",
    "interestingly , in the radii close to the black hole , the sign of @xmath33 becomes distinctly opposite than the outer region in the high magnetic field case .",
    "however , by this radius the required amount of angular momentum has already been transferred outwards in order to advance the matter close to the black hole and hence the change in sign of @xmath33 does not create any physical impact onto the flow . if we vary the conditions chosen in equation ( [ bcr ] ) , e.g. , assume the components of magnetic field inequal , the qualitative picture remains unchanged  the magnetic stress in the presence of a large scale magnetic field could adequately transfer angular momentum . however , it is very important to note that if the strength of magnetic field and the corresponding value at the inner edge around the sonic radius would have been even higher , above a certain value , then the infall would no longer be possible .",
    "this is similar to the situation when above a certain value of @xmath21 at the sonic radius in a given flow , the infall is no longer possible ( see , @xcite ) .",
    "if the flow is gas pressure dominated with larger @xmath71 , then all the above basic features remain the same .",
    "be it radiation or gas dominated , large scale magnetic stresses , yet @xmath2 , can transport angular momentum as efficiently as the @xmath0-prescription does . nevertheless , below we discuss the effects of large scale magnetic field in the gas pressure dominated flows around a supermassive black hole .      the supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy , sgr  a * , presumably exhibits a gas pressure dominated , advection dominated , accretion flow .",
    "this motivates us to undertake this case , when we choose @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and hence an appropriate @xmath100 .",
    "we furthermore choose @xmath101 , when strongly advective matter hardly has a chance to radiate photons .",
    "however , such a flow may also arise around a stellar mass black hole , e.g. microquasars .        the basic features in fig .",
    "[ sumasm ] are similar as those for the stellar mass cases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ stmasm ] . however , due to the gas dominance , and hence lower angular momenta , the mach number profiles practically do not have any centrifugal barrier .",
    "such flows are hotter , with @xmath102k , and more quasi - spherical , compared to the radiation dominated flows , when a very small part of the dissipated heat can be radiated away",
    ". however , the most significant difference in these flows lies in their low magnetic fields , compared to those discussed in  3.1 .",
    "this is due to the largeness of black hole masses in these flows , which leads to a much larger size of sub - keplerian flows , when the dimensional flow size scales as @xmath39 . as a result , due to the law of equipartition ,",
    "the magnetic field decreases significantly compared to the cases of stellar mass black hole , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sumasm]d ( as compared to those shown in fig .",
    "[ stmasm]d ) .",
    "the magnetic flows around nonrotating and rotating , both the black holes , have their viscous counterparts with respective @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "this furthermore confirms that even in gas dominated flows , the large scale magnetic field is able to transfer the angular momentum as efficiently as the @xmath0-prescription does with the most plausible values of @xmath0 .",
    "hypothesizing the increasing @xmath33 with increasing @xmath36 at the outer edge of the sub - keplerian flow , we obtain the same results as those for stellar mass black hole accretion flows described above , except at much lower magnetic fields . like the stellar mass cases , here also a  potential well \" forms which is featured in fig .",
    "[ sumasp]b , rendering the systems to have a zone for producing outflows .",
    "we do not repeat the detailed properties of it .",
    "figures [ sumasp]a , b also show the viscous flows resembling magnetic flows with @xmath105 and @xmath106 respectively for nonrotating and rotating black holes .      as defined in  2 , @xmath107 parametrize the scaling of the variations of @xmath108 respectively in the vertical direction .",
    "this has be to considered because of our averaging the flows in the vertical direction , while the variation of magnetic field in the vertical direction has not been neglected , as has not been for @xmath19 .",
    "interestingly , the solutions practically do not depend on the choices of @xmath82 and @xmath15 . however , with the increase of the magnitude of @xmath81 , which implies the increasing change of magnetic field with the vertical coordinate , the size of sub - keplerian flow decreases",
    "this is because , stronger the vertical variation of magnetic field , larger the change of the magnetic stresses in the vertical direction , on average faster the infall of matter is .",
    "this also argues for the faster rate of throwing the matter via outflows , when the outflows , in a more self - consistent 2.5-dimensional flow , are expected to plunge out via the magnetic field lines in the vertical direction .",
    "hence , with the increase of magnetic field in the vertical direction , the system becomes more prone to outflow matter .",
    "subsequently , a faster rate of outflow renders a faster removal of angular momentum and hence a faster rate of infall . as a result",
    ", the flow could remain keplerian with the aid of adequate mechanisms of angular momentum transfer , till further inner region of the flow .",
    "hence , the boundary between the keplerian and sub - keplerian flows advances towards the black hole .      as the current @xmath109 in the conducting fluid with conductivity @xmath110 and electric field @xmath111",
    "is known to be @xmath112 , faraday s law of induction in the steady - state for axisymmetric accretion disks considered here , as given by equation ( [ indt ] ) , can be recalled as @xmath113 for a flow with very large @xmath50 ( when @xmath114 ) , the @xmath115component of equation ( [ ef ] ) , averaged in @xmath36 and integrated over @xmath116 , is given by @xmath117 when the constant can be identified as @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the elementary surface area in the disk plane and @xmath120 is the magnetic flux . therefore , equation ( [ ef3 ] )",
    "fixes the relation between advection and @xmath34 , and hence the magnetic flux in the accretion flow .",
    "this also can be understood by recasting faraday s law of induction into @xmath121 which furthermore argues for @xmath122 when @xmath123 is the coulomb potential and @xmath124 is a constant vector .",
    "hence , for a steady axisymmetric accretion flow @xmath125 therefore for @xmath126 , @xmath127 is conserved .",
    "the constant @xmath128 or @xmath129 can be fixed from a given boundary condition . in really",
    ", however , the flow is not expected to be purely axisymmetric and , hence , @xmath128 or @xmath129 can also be mimicked as the contribution from non - axisymmetry .",
    "earlier @xcite discussed a model of geometrically thin accretion flows in the presence of weak magnetic field , but assuming @xmath130 which is not true in general .",
    "the constraint on advection arisen in equation ( [ e2 ] ) is clearly visible in the velocity profiles in fig .",
    "[ stmasm]a with respect to the variations of the vertical component of magnetic field shown in fig .",
    "[ bcomp ] . for the magnetic flow around a schwarzschild black hole , @xmath18 first increases steadily with the decrease of @xmath34 at larger radii and",
    "subsequently matter tends to slow down due to centrifugal effect ( with the relative decrease of infall rate @xmath59 ) with the increase of @xmath34 until @xmath131 .",
    "finally , matter plunges into the black hole steadily with a sharp decrease of @xmath34 . for a rotating black hole ,",
    "however , @xmath18 steadily increases with the steady decrease of @xmath34 almost throughout .",
    "nevertheless , very close to the black hole , @xmath34 slightly increases due to the spin effect of black hole , decreasing @xmath59 slightly .",
    "this hints the power of black hole s spin to plunge the matter out .",
    "we have discussed the power of large scale magnetic field in advective accretion flows around black holes in oder to transport angular momentum , enabling infall of matter . in a simpler keplerian , self - similar model framework , such an investigation had been initiated by @xcite long ago , and in the cases of circumstellar disks around young stars ( e.g. @xcite ) , such an approach has been explored .",
    "however , it remained unexplored , to the best of our knowledge , in the advective accretion disk around black holes , when it may exhibit a hard spectral state , until this work .",
    "note that , often , only hard spectral states of disks are associated with the outflows / jets .",
    "we have found that the flows with plasma-@xmath2 exhibit adequate magnetic transport  as efficient as the @xmath0-viscosity with @xmath92 would do .",
    "this is interesting as the origin of @xmath0 ( and the corresponding instability and turbulence ) is itself not well understood .",
    "the maximum required large scale magnetic field is a few factor times @xmath132 g in a disk around @xmath133 black holes and @xmath134 g in a disk around @xmath135 supermassive black holes .",
    "the presence of such a field , in particular for a stellar mass black hole disk when the binary companion supplying mass is a sun - like star with the magnetic field on average @xmath136 g , may be understood , if the field is approximately frozen with the disk fluids ( or the supplied fluids from the companion star remain approximately frozen with the magnetic field ) or disk fluids exhibit large reynolds number .",
    "indeed , all the present computations are done at the limit of large reynolds number , as really is the case in accretion flows , such that the term associated with the magnetic diffusivity in the induction equation can be neglected .",
    "the size of a disk around supermassive black holes is proportionately larger compared to that around a stellar mass black hole .",
    "hence , from the equipartition theory , indeed the magnetic field is expected to be decreased here compared to that around stellar mass black holes .",
    "is there any observational support for the existence of such a magnetic field , as required for the magnetic accretion flows discussed here ?",
    "interestingly , the polarization measurements in the hard state of cyg  x-1 imply that it should have at least @xmath137 mg field at the source of emission ( @xcite ) . in order to explain such high polarization ,",
    "a jet model was suggested by @xcite , which requires a magnetic field @xmath138 g at the base of jet and hence in the underlying accretion disk .",
    "also , the magnetic field in the inner region of accretion disks around more than a dozen black holes has been found to be very high , based on a model relating the observed kinetic power of relativistic jet to the magnetic field of acretion disks ( @xcite ) .",
    "different components of magnetic stress tensor have different roles : @xmath97 controls the infall in the disk plane , whereas @xmath95 renders the flow to spiral outwards and , hence , outflow .",
    "moreover , @xmath139 helps to kick the matter out vertically .",
    "larger the field strength , larger is the power of magnetic stresses .",
    "interestingly , the magnitude of magnetic field decreases , as the steady - state matter advances towards the black hole .",
    "this is primarily because @xmath95 ( and also @xmath97 for a rotating black hole ) decreases inwards almost entirely in order to induce outflow .",
    "this furthermore reveals a decreasing @xmath87 as the output of self - consistent solutions of the coupled set of equations , which is reflected in the @xmath140 profile .    in the present computations",
    ", we have assumed the flow to be vertically averaged without allowing any vertical component of the flow velocity ( but keeping all the components of magnetic field ) .",
    "the most self - consistent approach , in order to understand vertical transport of matter through the magnetic effects which in turn leads to the radial infall of rest of the matter , is considering the flow to be moving in the vertical direction from the disk plane as well .",
    "such an attempt , in the absence of magnetic effects , was made earlier by @xcite in the model framework of coupled disk - outflow systems .",
    "in such a framework , the authors furthermore showed that the outflow power of the correlated disk - outflow systems increases with the increasing spin of black holes .",
    "our future goal is now to combine that model with the model of present work , so that the coupled disk - outflow systems can be investigated more self - consistently and rigorously , when the magnetic field plays indispensable role in order to generate vertical flux in the three - dimensional flows .",
