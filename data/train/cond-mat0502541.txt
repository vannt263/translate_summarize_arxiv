    "the nonconserved case models ordering dynamics in random magnets , and the conserved case models segregation kinetics in disordered binary mixtures . we have studied domain growth for two classes of disordered systems : + ( a ) the _ random - bond ising model _ ( rbim ) , where the exchange interaction has a uniform distribution on the interval @xmath41 $ ] , @xmath161 . in this case",
    ", the critical temperature @xmath162 remains approximately unchanged .",
    "+ ( b ) the _ dilute ising model _ ( dim ) , where the exchange interaction is randomized by the dilution of magnetic atoms with non - magnetic impurities . in this case , the critical temperature @xmath107 ranges from @xmath163 ( in @xmath23 ) to @xmath164 ( @xmath109 in @xmath23 ) .",
    "+ both classes of disorder are of considerable experimental relevance .",
    "the general framework for understanding coarsening in disordered systems is as follows . at early times , the domain sizes are small and domain growth is unaffected by disorder . at late times , the domain boundaries are trapped by disorder sites , and asymptotic growth proceeds via thermally - activated hopping over disorder barriers .",
    "clearly , the asymptotic growth law depends critically on the length - scale dependence of the disorder barrier @xmath12 . in this context , an important study is due to huse and henley ( hh ) @xcite . in the hh scenario ,",
    "the disorder barriers have a power - law dependence on the domain size , @xmath165 .",
    "these result in a logarithmic domain growth law in the asymptotic regime .",
    "we find that our mc results are not in agreement with the hh scenario .",
    "rather , our results are consistent with power - law growth with an exponent @xmath155 which depends on the temperature @xmath1 and the disorder amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "this is in agreement with a number of experiments @xcite , and early simulations of droplet shrinking in disordered systems by oh and choi @xcite .",
    "this scenario arises naturally in the context of logarithmic energy barriers , and the corresponding functional dependence of @xmath0 is in excellent agreement with our numerical results .",
    "our results provide a framework for the analysis of experiments and simulations on domain growth in disordered magnets and binary mixtures .",
    "we hope that our study will motivate fresh experimental studies of this important problem .",
    "in particular , there is a paucity of experimental results on phase separation in disordered mixtures .",
    "a logarithmic @xmath8-dependence of energy barriers was also proposed in the context of spin glasses , see h. rieger , j. phys .",
