    "the understanding of the corresponding non - equilibrium properties is of utmost importance .",
    "this is especially true when one considers potential applications based on the thermal conductivity of materials @xcite and the heat transport within nanodevices @xcite .",
    "being able to describe the dynamics and dissipation of such nanoscale atomic systems is central for modern nanoscience .",
    "for that , one has to consider the central region of interest as an open system surrounded by a heat bath ( an environment ) which is in contact with the system and is kept at a given temperature . for studying the transport properties , one has to consider the proper non - equilibrium conditions , i.e. the central region is connected to two ( or more ) independent heat baths ( kept at their own temperatures ) . hence a heat flow ( transient or stationary depending on the experimental conditions )",
    "is established between the two baths via the central region .    an appropriate general approach for treating this kind of systems",
    "is based on the so - called generalised langevin equation ( gle)@xcite . the gle is an equation of motion containing non - markovian stochastic processes where the particle ( point particle with mass ) has a memory effect to its velocity .    the gle has been derived for a realistic system of @xmath0 particles coupled to a single realistic ( harmonic ) bath , i.e. a bath described at the atomic level @xcite .",
    "the non - markovian dynamics is obtained for the central system with gaussian distributed random forces and a memory kernel that is exactly proportional to the random force autocorrelation function @xcite . solving the gle for complex heterogeneous and extended systems is still a challenge .",

    "note that , for a system at equilibrium , the langevin dynamics applied only to a part of the system can be derived from the gle assuming short - range atomic interactions and the markovian approximation @xcite .",
    "it was also shown in [ ] that thermostatting only some of the degrees of freedom by using the langevin dynamics brings the system , in equilibrium , to the corresponding canonical distribution .",

    "[ ] , the trotter decomposition we use to obtain our gle - md algorithm has been shown to provide a more appropriate description of the velocity correlation functions . an accurate statistical description of the velocities is crucial in the present paper , as we extract the local temperature from the velocities statistical distributions .",
    "it should noted that there can not be any form of coupling between the two baths .",
    "otherwise they would not be independent and therefore it would not be possible to consider them as being kept at their own thermodynamic equilibrium characterised by the temperature @xmath3 .                    the velocity distributions are calculated from the averages of several realisations of each velocity distribution obtained at a given timestep , after the system is thermalised . for @xmath117 = 200 k , the thermalisation is reached after 78 ps of gle dynamics , i.e. after 40000 time - steps with @xmath80 = 2 fs .",
    "the distributions are averaged over all the time - steps in the time range @xmath177 $ ] ps .",
    "calculation using the lg thermostats and the gle-2b approach were performed at equilibrium when the system is uniformly thermostatted at @xmath178 . from the results of these calculations",
    ", we observed that the al nanowire melts down at t = 500 k for the eam inter - atomic potential we used . during the md run",
    ", we observe the formation of the smaller constriction in the middle of the nanowire and eventually all the atoms of the layers a to f end up on the surfaces of the l and r bath regions . at temperatures",
    "t = 400 - 450 , we also obtain the formation of a smaller constriction in the middle of the nanowire ( with atoms moving towards the left and right sides of the constriction ) .",
    "the constriction consists of 3 layers of only 2 atoms in each layer .",
    "this is what we call `` structural instabilities '' , meaning that the central system does not have the same atomic configuration ( layers made of 4 or 5 atoms ) . such strong modifications of the configuration of the system make it difficult to perform a consistent analysis of the ( layer - by - layer ) temperature profiles .",
    "one should notice that the melting of al surfaces , depending on the miller indices @xmath179 , may occur even at temperatures which are 150 to 200 k below the bulk melting temperature [ see for example p. stoltze , j. k. nrskov , and u. landman , phys .",
    "lett . * 61 * , 440 ( 1988 ) ] , i.e. roughly around 730 - 780 k. the coordination of an al atom at the surface is roughly half of that of an atom in the bulk . therefore we believe that it is not surprising that the melting of the nanowire happens at even lower temperature as the coordination of the atoms inside the nanowire is even smaller that the coordination of surface atoms .",
    "the atoms of the bath reduced regions are present in the gle-2b method ( implemented in the lammps code ) , as one needs to calculate the matrix elements @xmath180 for the instantaneous atomic positions of the central system .",
    "however the atoms in the bath reduced regions are kept fixed during the gle-2b runs , hence they do not contribute to the total kinetic energy of the system shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system ] .",
    "futhermore the contribution , to the total potential energy , from these atoms is just a constant throughout the gle-2b runs .",
    "the gle-2b runs , as well as the lg runs with @xmath132 ps , are performed for 120 ps ( 120000 timesteps with @xmath181 fs ) .",
    "the steady state is reached around 80 ps .",
    "the velocity histograms ( from which the local temperature is extracted ) are obtained from statistical averaging over the time range 100 to 120 ps .",
    "for the lg runs with @xmath126 ps , the steady state is reached after a longer time , @xmath114 300 ps .",
    "the velocity histograms are obtained from statistical averaging over the time range 450 to 600 ps ."
