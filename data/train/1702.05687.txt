    "temporal modes of light @xcite are a burgeoning new subspace for both classical and quantum information encoding @xcite .",
    "the temporal mode ( tm ) bases are discrete and in principle infinite dimensional , and truly orthogonal .",
    "these orthogonal modes have overlapping spectra at the same carrier frequency , fully overlap in time , and share the same polarization and transverse spatial mode properties , making them convenient for long - distance communication and interfacing with optical memories @xcite .",
    "co - propagating tms maintain relative coherence across the entire mode space , and experience the same reversible unitary dispersion during propagation in typical media . in order to fully exploit tms as a resource ,",
    "we need highly tm - selective , high - fidelity devices that can generate , sort , store , measure , and generally manipulate them , even at the single - photon level @xcite .",
    "many optically - pumped processes , such as atomic - ensemble raman memories @xcite and nonlinear optical frequency conversion @xcite via three / four - wave mixing @xcite , are already known to be tm sensitive when using pulsed pumps @xcite , and show tm discriminatory behavior at low coupling strengths @xcite . increasing the pump intensities",
    "causes the tm discrimination to peak and regress to smaller values , thus ultimately limiting the maximum selectivity of straight - forward implementations of such processes @xcite .",
    "this loss in selectivity is understood to be a result of time - ordering effects between interacting temporal wave - packets of the participating fields ( be they electromagnetic , polarization - phononic , acoustic , etc . ) convecting through each other at varied group velocities",
    "@xcite . this selectivity limit , however , can be asymtotically overcome @xcite by using interferometric techniques ( `` tm interferometry '' ) in cascaded setups to enhance tm separability up to @xmath3% , even at large coupling strengths @xcite .",
    "this new capability opens new avenues for information processing , including the complete set of operations needed for linear - optical quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "quantum frequency conversion through @xmath5- or @xmath6- nonlinear media is gaining in usefulness as an all - optical means of implementing a fully - programmeable `` quantum pulse gate , '' whose role is to multiplex and demultiplex tms @xcite . the ability of nonlinear frequency conversion to unitarily reshape , and preserve quantum information stored in the tm basis is well known @xcite .",
    "the tm - selectivity of frequency conversion @xcite suffers from the above - mentioned time - ordering - induced upper limit , necessitating an eventual exploration of tm interferometry .",
    "experimental exploration of tm discrimination is still in its nascent stages @xcite . while the theoretically predicted selectivity limit still stands to be broken , other more specific predictions of said theory have yet to be validated . in this paper , we redress this issue both experimentally and theoretically , as well as provide a simple parameter - set guideline to aid in designing similar processes in other systems and spectral regions .    in the following ,",
    "we first model pulsed - pump mediated , second - order - nonlinear - optical frequency conversion between a signal band and an idler band as a set of coupled - mode equations , and define a tm - selectivity figure of merit to characterize the process .",
    "we then showcase high tm selectivity in a parameter regime where the pump and signal pulses propagate with the same group velocity , but the idler group velocity is significantly different .",
    "we illustrate specific predictions of the model for various input conditions , and propose a means of adequately approximating the aforementioned parameter regime by choosing band - carrier frequencies around the ones phase matched for second - harmonic generation ( shg ) in typical off - the - shelf nonlinear waveguides .",
    "we then demostrate tm - selective frequency conversion in a @xmath7 @xmath8 m wide , @xmath7 mm long , mgo : ppln waveguide periodically poled for shg from @xmath9 nm to @xmath10 nm at @xmath11c .",
    "we employ a kerr - modelocked , ultrafast titanium - sapphire laser and a folded treacy - grating pair pulse shaper with a reflective , 2d spatial light modulator , to situate and shape the pump and signal bands at @xmath12 nm and @xmath13 nm respectively , with bandwidths @xmath14 nm .",
    "we use pump pulses with energies of order @xmath15 nj , and pulses of temporal widths of order @xmath1 fs , to verify all the predicted features of our model .",
    "the first two numerically computed , natural schmidt modes of the model achieved a @xmath16-to-@xmath17 contrast ( @xmath18% vs. @xmath19% ) in conversion efficiencies for the two tested pump shapes in both theory and experiment .",
    "while the experiments are carried out using weak coherent - state signals , theory indicates the same conversion efficiencies and tm selectivities would be observed using heralded single - photon wave packets @xcite .",
    "the model for frequency conversion ( fc ) of temporal wave - packet modes in a @xmath5-nonlinear waveguide may be expressed as a pair of coupled - mode equations involving the electric - field envelopes , treated as quantum field operators @xcite .",
    "we designate the letters @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 to denote electromagnetic fields within the three participating frequency bands , namely , the pump , signal , and idler bands , respectively .",
    "the band - central , or carrier frequencies have to be constrained by energy conservation ( @xmath23 ) , and the nonlinear - optical waveguide used for frequency conversion is assumed to be periodically poled to ensure proper phase matching ( @xmath24 , where @xmath25 are wavenumbers and @xmath4 is the poling period ) for the pulses carrier frequencies . if the pulses in question are sufficiently narrowband , we can ignore second- and higher - order dispersion for all three bands , and write the coupled - mode equations as    [ eq1 ] @xmath26    here , @xmath27 is a composite parameter denoting the strength of the interaction , and is linearly dependent on the medium nonlinearity ( @xmath5 ) , and the pump - pulse energy , as well as transverse spatial mode - overlap functions .",
    "the parameters @xmath28 are the corresponding group - slownesses ( inverse group velocities ) for the bands @xmath29 , and the operators @xmath30 denote field - annihilation operators for square - normalized , slowly - varying , complex amplitudes of the temporal modes @xcite within the medium at location @xmath31 along the propagation direction .    we require no additional noise operators in eqs .",
    "[ eq1 ] since quantum fc is in principle a noiseless , unitary process @xcite . in the single - photon case ,",
    "these operators can be replaced by quantum wavefunction amplitudes @xcite . for weak coherent pulses ( as in the case of our experiment ) ,",
    "they can be replaced by complex functions denoting the classical pulse - envelope shapes , because the same equations hold .",
    "the strong classical pump pulse @xmath32 is assumed to be unchanging during fc .",
    "the medium is of length @xmath33 , and @xmath34 defines its input face .",
    "the nonlinearity of the medium is assumed uniform throughout its length .    for given values for all of the parameters defined above , and a known pump - pulse shape @xmath32 , fc in a finite medium",
    "can be treated as a scattering process that relates the input temporal modes @xmath35 to the output modes @xmath36 via a set of green function ( gf ) relations :    @xmath37    each output field @xmath38 is linearly dependent on both input fields @xmath39 , where @xmath40 denotes an input time and @xmath41 denotes an output time .",
    "this formalism is convenient for analysis of temporal - mode selectivity @xcite , as the separability of the four green function subkernels can be quantified via their singular - value decomposition @xcite :    @xmath42    the functions @xmath43 are the input `` schmidt modes '' and @xmath44 are the corresponding output schmidt modes for the _ r _ and _ s _ bands respectively .",
    "the schmidt modes define the sets of `` natural temporal modes '' for the fc problem given a particular pump shape and medium characteristics . for a given integer index @xmath45 , the quartet of modes",
    "are related to each other in a beamsplitter - like transformation through the schmidt coefficients ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) , which obey the unitarity constraint , @xmath48 . in simple terms , if the input state in the @xmath21-band were to be a single photon ( or a weak , coherent pulse ) in the temporal mode @xmath49 , and the @xmath22-band input were to be vacuum , then the probability ( efficiency ) of frequency conversion from @xmath21-band to @xmath22-band would be @xmath50 . the converted component exits in the @xmath22-band in mode @xmath51 , and the unconverted component ( occurring with probability / efficiency @xmath52 ) exits in the @xmath21-band in the mode @xmath53 .",
    "note that each of the four sets of schmidt modes forms a complete basis set for its band and input / output context .",
    "the effect of fc on an arbitrary input temporal mode can be easily computed by expressing said input state in the natural input schmidt - mode basis of the device and employing the schmidt - coefficient beamsplitter relations .",
    "we choose to arrange the schmidt modes in the four sets , and the corresponding schmidt coefficients , in decreasing order of conversion efficiency ( ce ) , such that @xmath54 and so on .",
    "an fc device with perfect mode discrimination would have a non - zero @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , meaning the gf subkernel is separable but not necessarily 100% efficient .",
    "a device with perfect mode _ selectivity _ would have @xmath57 .",
    "to characterize mode - selectivity , we define a figure of merit called selectivity @xmath58 @xcite . it has previously been shown that perfect selectivity can not be achieved in simple inter - pulse interaction systems due to time - ordering corrections @xcite . but",
    "selectivity asymptotically approaching @xmath3% can be achieved in cascaded , multi - stage fc implementations @xcite .",
    "this paper does not address multi - stage fc .",
    "we can condense all of the model parameters into three dimensionless quantities in order to aid mapping settings and results from diverse fc systems to this model . these are @xcite :    @xmath59    where @xmath60 is the temporal - width of the pump pulse , and @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 is an interband coupling strength .",
    "@xmath63 is the signal - idler inter - pulse walk - off relative to pump width , and @xmath64 is the group - velocity mismatch contrast .    through an exhaustive numerical exploration @xcite",
    ", we have previously determined that for good gf separability at low pump energies , as well as the best selectivity ( @xmath65 ) at higher pump energies , the best parameter regime is @xmath66 . by designing the system such that the group - velocity of the pump pulse is identical to that of one of the other bands ( the @xmath21-band , for the definitions in eq . [ eq4 ] ) , and highly different from that of the remaining ( @xmath22 ) band , we can have @xmath67 .",
    "we call this condition the group - velocity matched ( gvm ) regime , and it was first considered in detail in @xcite",
    ". very large @xmath63 , however , are physically inaccessible since realistic nonlinear waveguides have finite length , and the pump pulse needs to remain reasonably narrowband to maintain phase - matching and avoid higher - order dispersion .",
    "the green function solutions for the gvm regime are known in closed analytical form @xcite , which aids in numerical analysis , as well as physical system design .",
    "we have validated these analytical solutions using regime - agnostic wave - mixing simulations based on a numerical split - step implementation of the propagation and interaction of the various fields @xcite . specifically , we propagate the fields and apply dispersion in the fourier domain , and `` mix '' them using fourth - order runge - kutta in the time domain , alternating between the two for every iteration .",
    "we compute the green functions by running the simulation for a basis set of input conditions , and computing the overlap of the resulting outputs with another spanning basis set of functions .",
    "the numerical simulations verify that small deviations from the assumed conditions ( gvm regime , absense of higher - order dispersion , etc . )",
    "do not cause significant departures from the predictions of the analytical solutions .",
    "we present some of these predictions here .            in the gvm regime ,",
    "the group - velocity matched signal ( @xmath21-band ) copropagates with the pump pulse in the medium , and the unmatched idler ( @xmath22-band ) pulse falls behind ( or , in the case of anamolous dispersion , speeds ahead ) of the other two pulses . consequently , as long as @xmath68 in addition to the gvm condition , both the input and output @xmath21-band schmidt modes ( @xmath69 , @xmath70 ) will have the same temporal widths as that of the pump pulse , and the @xmath22-band input and output modes ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) get temporally stretched by a factor of @xmath63 .    in fig .",

    "the complex shape of the pump - pulse envelope fully determines the shape of the dominant @xmath21-band schmidt modes ( fig .",
    "[ fig02](a , d ) ) .",
    "the dominant @xmath22-band schmidt modes , however , are influenced very little by the pump shape , and instead reflect the variation of the medium nonlinearity along the waveguide propagation direction ( fig .",

    "the first ( @xmath76 ) @xmath21-band input and output schmidt modes are nearly identical to the pump pulse shape ( and the first @xmath22-band modes look like flat , square pulses ) . but at higher @xmath62 , the first schmidt mode changes into a temporally skewed version of the pump pulse ( see fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "the schmidt coefficients ( and therefore , the schmidt - mode ce ) are independent of the pump - pulse shape .",
    "figure [ fig03](c ) depicts the rapid rise of the ces of the second and higher schmidt modes with increasing @xmath62 , which results in a cap on the maximum achievable selectivity .",
    "curiously , for a given @xmath62 , different orthogonal pump - pulse shapes would result in mutually orthogonal dominant @xmath21-band schmidt modes , even if the modes cease to resemble the original pump shapes .    in our experiment , we validate these precise predictions by following two approaches .",
    "firstly , for given pump - pulse shape and energy , we maximize the signal ce by attempting to match the @xmath21-input schmidt modes predicted by theory .",
    "we numerically precompute the first schmidt - mode shape for both gaussian and hermite - gaussian pump pulses for a continuous range of @xmath62 .",
    "then the problem of matching the schmidt mode at a given pump power reduces to ce maximization through a scan of the single parameter @xmath62 .    a second means of verifying the model is to keep the signal input pulse shapes static , but delay them with respect to the pump pulse and chart the ce .",
    "for gaussian and first - order hermite - gaussian pump and signal shapes , four surface plots of ce for various input inter - pump - signal delays and pump energies have been numerically generated and plotted in fig .",

    "the @xmath21-band schmidt mode distortions show up as temporal shifts and lobe - peak asymmetries at higher @xmath62 .          in order to take advantage of theoretical predictions",
    ", one must choose the physical system parameters to match the regimes of applicability of said theory .",
    "in the context of tm - selective frequency conversion , the gvm or near - gvm condition ( @xmath66 ) must constrain the selection of waveguide material , length , band central frequencies , and tm bandwidths . at the time of this writing , only two other groups @xcite have addressed experimental frequency conversion in a tm - selective context .",
    "the silberhorn group @xcite use homebuilt , periodically - poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguides with a poling period of about @xmath77 @xmath8 m .",
    "such a period gives the optimum phase - matching for sum frequency generation ( sfg ) from bands centered near @xmath78 nm and @xmath79 nm , into the band around @xmath80 nm . they engineer their waveguide dispersion to achieve perfect gvm ( @xmath67 ) at these wavelengths , and compensate for fabrication errors by tuning the waveguide temperature in the @xmath81c range .",
    "they can thus afford to use longer waveguides ( @xmath82 mm ) and short pulse lengths ( @xmath83 fs ) and obtain large @xmath63 values without having to worry about signal - pump inter - pulse walkoff within the medium during propagation .",
    "although exact gvm is optimum for tm - selectivity , one can deviate from perfect signal - pump gvm and still retain most of its advantages , as long as @xmath66 is satistied .",
    "the kumar / kanter group @xcite hit upon an interesting solution that allows for minor deviation from gvm .",
    "they used a @xmath84 mm long , custom ppln waveguide designed for second - harmonic generation ( shg ) from @xmath85 nm into @xmath86 nm at @xmath87c , and situated their pump ( @xmath88 nm ) and signal ( @xmath89 nm ) bands symmetrically on either side of the shg wavelength , yielding @xmath90 . their pump / signal sources and pulse shapers restricted their temporal widths to around @xmath7 ps , implying @xmath91 .",
    "the theory predicts @xcite that their selectivity would improve significantly with larger pump / signal bandwidths , as we have used here .",
    "we also employ an shg waveguide ( @xmath9 nm to @xmath10 nm at @xmath11c ) for fc by situating the signal and pump bands on either side of the red shg pump band .",
    "typical shg acceptance bandwidths are very narrow . as long as the fc - pump band is sufficiently detuned from the shg - pump wavelength",
    ", so as to avoid pump - only spurious blue - light generation , the relative spectral flatness of normal dispersion ensures near - gvm conditions ( see fig . [ fig05](a ) ) .",
    "one must choose a temporal width that is small enough to ensure @xmath92 ( for large idler - pump walkoff ) , but wide enough to ensure that the pump - signal inter - pulse walkoff within the medium remains a small fraction of the total pulse widths ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "shg waveguides , when pumped at the sum frequency can generate degenerate photon - pairs via spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) . the joint - spectral amplitude of the pairs are tightly anticorrelated in frequency ( fig .",
    "[ fig05](b ) ) , reflecting the narrowness of the shg red - pump acceptance band @xcite .",

    "this behavior makes off - the - shelf waveguides suitable for tm - selective fc experiments .",
    "we derived both our strong pump and weak signal pulses by reshaping the output of a homebuilt , kerr - lens mode - locked , ultrafast ti : sapph laser with pulse duration of about @xmath0 fs .",
    "we tuned the cavity to cause it to lase at @xmath12 nm with a fwhm bandwidth of around @xmath94 nm , at a pulse rate of @xmath95 mhz .",

    "the spatial dispersion of the shaper at the slm was @xmath105 nm / pixel , although , the actual shaper resolution is limited by the spot size . in order to modulate both amplitude and phase , we used silberberg group s @xcite first - order approach , where we form a vertical blazed grating pattern on the slm and pick off its @xmath106 reflection as the output .",
    "different phase ramps may be applied to different wavelengths ( at different horizontal positions ) to affect the amount of power in the @xmath106 reflection , and the phases can be manipulated by vertically shifting the blazed grating upwards / downwards .",

    "[ fig07 ] .        for the bandwidths we chose to work with ( @xmath109 nm ) , the pump band had sufficient power to allow for a frequency - resolved - optical - grating ( frog ) measurement .",
    "a commercial grenouille 8 - 50-usb by swamp optics was employed for this .",

    "<S> quantum frequency conversion ( qfc ) in nonlinear optical media is a powerful tool for temporal - mode selective manipulation of light . </S>",
    "<S> recent attempts at achieving high mode selectivities and/or fidelities have had to resort to multi - dimensional optimization schemes to determine the system s natural schmidt modes . </S>",
    "<S> certain combinations of relative - group velocities between the relevant frequency bands , medium length , and temporal pulse widths have been known to achieve good selectivities ( exceeding @xmath0% ) for temporal modes that are nearly identical to pump pulse shapes , even for high conversion efficiencies . working in this parameter regime using an off - the - shelf , second - harmonic generation , mgo : ppln waveguide , and with pulses on the order of @xmath1 fs at wavelengths around @xmath2 nm </S>",
    "<S> , we verify experimentally that model - predicted schmidt modes provide the high temporal - mode selectivity expected . </S>",
    "<S> this paves the way to the implementation of a proposed two - stage qfc scheme that is predicted to reach near - perfect ( @xmath3% ) selectivity .    </S>",
