    "in general , pns have axisymmetric structures .",
    "the classification of pns into three basic types , round , elliptical and bipolar @xcite , is based on their axisymmetric appearances . however , many pns also possess non - axisymmetric structures .",
    "@xcite proposed a scheme to classify pns according to their departure from axisymmetry .",
    "they considered six categories : ( 1 ) pns where the central star is not at the center of the nebula ; ( 2 ) pns having one side brighter than the other ; ( 3 ) pns having unequal size or shape of the two sides ; ( 4 ) pns where the symmetry axis is bent , e.g. , the two lobes in a bipolar pn are bent toward the same side ; ( 5 ) pns where the main departure from axisymmetry is in the outer regions , e.g. , an outer arc ; ( 6 ) pns showing no large - scale departure from axisymmetry .",
    "they found that about 50% of the analyzed sample has large - scale departures from axisymmetry .",
    "the problem of departure from axisymmetry in pns is usually investigated through the examination of optical images .",
    "this poses a problem because dust also plays a role in making such asymmetry .",
    "for example , in the sample analyzed by @xcite , more than half of the pns they found to have departure from axisymmetry are the types with unequal intensity or size .",
    "this kind of asymmetric appearance can also be caused by dust extinction , even if the intrinsic brightness of the nebula is axisymmetric .",
    "it is very difficult to draw conclusions about the real shapes of pns based only on their apparent optical forms . in order to remove the bias caused by dust extinction while investigating the shapes of pns ,",
    "it is necessary to understand the dust distribution in pns .",
    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars eject large amount of dust and gas in the form of stellar winds .",
    "these stellar grains is a major source of dust grains in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "although the details of dust formation are still poorly understood , the properties of circumstellar dust have been extensively studied in the infrared , e.g. , by the _ infrared astronomy satellite _",
    "( _ iras _ ) and _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) missions .",
    "since pns descend from agb stars , the remnants of the agb dust envelopes should still be present in pns @xcite .",
    "the presence of dust in pns was first detected in ngc  7027 via its infrared emission @xcite .",
    "this infrared excess peaks around 30 @xmath2 m and has a color temperature of @xmath0100  k. although the existence of dust in pns first came as a surprise , its widespread presence is now confirmed by _",
    "iras _ observations @xcite .    while the presence of dust in pns is well established by infrared spectroscopy ,",
    "very little is known about its spatial distribution .",
    "recent development in mid - infrared cameras has just begun to explore the dust distribution of pns ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , a full mapping of the dust distribution of pns has to wait until the development of large - format mid - infrared cameras with high resolution and high sensitivity .",
    "an alternate and underutilized method to derive the dust distribution is by comparing the hydrogen recombination line map of a pn with its corresponding radio free - free continuum map .",
    "the recombination line ( e.g.  h@xmath1 ) and free - free continuum emission are independent tracers of the distribution of the ionized gas , and both of their fluxes are proportional to @xmath3 under optically thin conditions , where @xmath4 is the electron density and _ v _ is the volume of the nebula .",
    "if dust is present , they will have no effect on the long wavelength radio emission , but the h@xmath1 emission will be attenuated by dust . therefore the dust distribution can be indirectly obtained by comparing the h@xmath1 and radio maps , assuming the dust is associated with the ionized gas .",
    "this method has been applied to different objects by various authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper ,",
    "we have derived optical depth maps of five compact pns obtained with the same technique .",
    "compact pns are selected for this study because their small angular sizes allow the assumption that any foreground interstellar extinction is homogeneous over the entire object , so that the different degrees of extinction over a pn are only related to its internal dust distribution .",
    "in a fully ionized region , both the free - free emission and the recombination fluxes are proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electron density .",
    "the ratio of the free - free flux to the h@xmath5 recombination line fluxes under case b ( where recombination to the ground state is excluded ) is given by the following equation @xcite :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the electron temperature , and @xmath8 corrects for the contribution to the free - free flux from he ions . for a he to h number ratio of 0.11 and for he to be equally divided between singly and doubly ionized forms , @xmath9 has a value of 1.258 . under case b , the effective recombination coefficients for h@xmath1 and",
    "h@xmath5 have a ratio of 2.85 @xcite . for @xmath10",
    "k , eq .  [ eq : ff - hb ] can be written as    @xmath11    which can be used to calculate the expected flux of h@xmath1 emission without dust extinction from the flux density of radio continuum emission .    in order to derive the extinction map ,",
    "we begin with the radio continuum and h@xmath1 maps of the same pn at similar angular resolutions .",
    "the expected h@xmath1 emission at each pixel is derived from the radio continuum map , and then divided by the observed h@xmath1 emission map for each object to obtain an extinction map , in which the dust optical depth at each pixel can be calculated . the intensity emitted by an object and received by the observer",
    "is related by the optical depth @xmath12 as    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the intensity emitted by the object , i.e. , the intensity expected to be received by the observer if no dust is present .",
    "therefore the dust optical depth for h@xmath1 emission is obtained by taking the natural logarithm of the ratio of the expected and observed h@xmath1 flux :    @xmath15",
    "in this paper , we have selected five compact pns with known high infrared excesses .",

    "this value is an order of magnitude smaller than the derived optical depth .",

    ", we need to develop a 3-d model .",
    "the details of the model analysis are presented in the next section .",
    "while the classification of pn morphology is based on appearance , this approach is vulnerable to projection effects .",
    "for example , elliptical and bipolar nebulae can appear round when the nebulae are viewed pole - on . in order to study their intrinsic properties ,",
    "there have been many attempts to find the detailed three - dimensional structures of pns @xcite . since many pns have the appearance of limb - brightened elliptical rings that are brightest on their minor axes , it is natural to consider models in which the nebulae have an elongated , hollow shell structure .",
    "models with this simple geometry , such as the prolate ellipsoidal shell discussed by @xcite , are successful in reproducing many of the shapes observed in pns .",
    "this was followed by the work of @xcite who developed a prolate ellipsoidal shell ( pes ) model to fit the radio images of pns .",
    "their model contains a spherical shell with both radial and latitude - dependent density gradients , and the shell is ionized by a central star to various depths at different latitudual directions .",
    "the ionized shell , when viewed at different angles , results in a variety of morphologies seen in pns .",
    "the parameters derived from the pes model reveal the asymmetric distribution of the ionized gas in the nebula .",
    "the pes model was later called the es model and explored extensively by @xcite to investigate the statistical distributions of the asymmetry parameters . however , because of a typographical error in the source code , there are some uncertainties in the derived model parameters in @xcite .    in order to simulate dust extinction effects , we have modified the es model to include a dust distribution with a constant gas - to - dust ratio , and we refer to this model as the dusty ellipsoidal shell ( des ) model . the des model has been used to analyze the observational images , including radio continuum , h@xmath1 , and dust extinction maps to constrain the ionized gas and dust distributions in compact pns .",
    "these different images of the same object provide a way to study the distribution of dust in pns , and also give better constraints on the model parameters than a single radio or optical image would .",
    "one advantage of using the model is that it helps to remove projection effects and to construct the three - dimensional structures of pns .",

    "no asymmetry factor in the longitude direction is needed to reproduce the radio image .",
    "no obvious anti - correlation between optical and extinction maps can be found .",
    "the model images are highly inclined to the line of sight , with @xmath88 .",
    "as in m  1 - 61 , a higher dynamic range image is expected to reveal the bipolar lobes in the ne - sw directions .",
    "as we can see from figures [ fg : bd+30.model ]  [ fg : m3 - 35.model ] , the model images can generally simulate the observed images .",
    "the remaining differences could be accounted for by several effects .",
    "for example , the assumed model geometry may be too simple to reproduce all of the complex small - scale structure of pns .",
    "other causes could include clumpy dust distributions that do not follow a simple constant gas - to - dust ratio .",
    "three out of five pns show an asymmetric density distribution in the longitudinal direction , a departure from axisymmetry . as summarized by @xcite",
    ", four main processes can result in the departure from axisymmetry in pns : interaction with the interstellar medium , mass - loss enhancements due to cool starspots , or a wide or a close binary companion .",
    "they investigated the effects of companions and estimated that about 27% of all pns are expected to acquire non - axisymmetric structure from binary interactions .",
    "nevertheless , the effects of the ism are also worth considering .",
    "since the majority of pns are distributed near the galactic plane where the mean density of the ism is higher , significant interaction between pns and the ism is expected .",
    "such phenomena can be seen from the disturbed emission on the outskirts of some nebulae ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and from some apparently off - centered nuclei ( e.g. , sh 2 - 216 , tweedy et al .",
    "1995 ; kfr 1 and mewe 1 - 4 , rauch et al . 2000 ) .",
    "the electron densities of these five pns are all found to be higher near their equators than near their poles .",
    "the small pole - to - equator density ratios ( @xmath5 ) of some nebulae indicate they would show a bipolar morphology if seen edge - on .",
    "the fraction of intrinsic bipolar pns therefore are likely to be higher than suggested by classification by apparent morphology . since the morphology of pns has been proposed to relate to their physical properties , ( e.g. , bipolar nebulae",
    "have been suggested to correlate with nebulae with more massive central stars ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is therefore important that we have a good understanding of the intrinsic strucures of pns . by using models such as des , we can more reliably estimate the fraction of bipolar nebulae and therefore assess any correlation with physical properties of the pns .",
    "we have derived the dust distribution in five compact pns from their h@xmath1 and radio images . from this study , we are able to determine the extent of contribution by dust extinction to the apparent departure from axi - symmetry in these pns . by comparing these results with simulations generated by the ellipsoidal shell model , we can infer the intrinsic morphologies of the pns .",
    "this method gives a more quantitative approach to the analysis of pn morphology than visual inspection of apparent morphology , and is therefore more capable to deducing proper statistics on the distribution of morphological types of pns .",
