    "early - type galaxies display a large variety of morphologies and kinematics . some of them show little rotation , significant kinematic twists , and kinematically - decoupled components in their centres .",
    "these systems are generally classified as ellipticals ( e ) from photometry alone , and are more common among the most massive objects , which also tend to be redder , metal - rich and to appear nearly round on the sky .",
    "the remaining early - type galaxies show a well - defined rotation pattern , with a rotation axis generally well aligned with the photometric minor axis .",
    "these objects are often less massive , tend to be bluer and can appear very flat on the sky .",
    "these galaxies are generally classified either as e or as lenticulars ( s0 ) from photometry @xcite .    despite the differences between individual objects ,",
    "when considering early - type galaxies as a class , it appears that they satisfy a number of regular relations between their global parameters .",
    "the first to be discovered was the relation @xmath10 between the luminosity and the velocity dispersion of the stars in elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "these authors also already realized that , under simple assumptions , the observed relation implies a variation of the mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath0 ) with galaxy luminosity .",
    "it is now clear that the faber - jackson relation is the projection of a thin plane , the fundamental plane ( fp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which correlates three global observables : the effective radius @xmath1 , the velocity dispersion @xmath11 and the surface brightness @xmath12 at the effective radius .",
    "the relation is of the form @xmath13 .",
    "if galaxies were homologous stellar systems in virial equilibrium , with constant @xmath0 , one would expect a correlation of the form @xmath14 .",
    "the observed relation has instead the form @xmath15 @xcite , with generally good agreement between different estimates and a weak dependence on the photometric band in the visual region ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "one way to explain the observed deviation , or ` tilt ' , of the fp from the virial predictions is to assume a power - law dependence of the @xmath0 on the other galaxy structural parameters ( mainly galaxy mass ) .",
    "the @xmath0 variation could be due to differences in the stellar population or in the dark matter fraction in different galaxies .",
    "other options are also possible however . the virial prediction for the fp",
    "is based on the assumption that galaxies form a set of homologous systems , both in the sense of having self - similar density distributions and in terms of having the same orbital distribution .",
    "these spatial and dynamical non - homologies could then also explain the observed tilt of the fp .",
    "all these possible effects are known to occur in practice , and they must contribute , to some degree , to the observed tilt of the fp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "various attempts have been made to estimate the contribution of the possible effects , with sometimes contradictory results .",
    "a number of authors tried to study the origin of the fp tilt using approximate models .",
    "@xcite used theoretical arguments to show that non - homology , particularly in the surface - brightness profile of galaxies , could in principle play a major role in the tilt .",
    "subsequent studies concluded that non - homology is indeed significant from the indirect argument that the expected change in @xmath0 of the stellar population alone can not explain the observed @xmath0 variation @xcite . from the observed spatial non - homology ,",
    "namely the inverse correlation of galaxy concentration and luminosity @xcite various works concluded that the contribution of the spatial non - homology of galaxies of different luminosities is responsible for a significant fraction of the observed fp tilt @xcite .",
    "these authors constructed simple spherical isotropic models and used large samples of galaxies to estimate the variation in the virial @xmath0 from the variation of the shape of galaxy profiles with luminosity .",
    "although changes in the light - profile shape do not , on their own , significantly affect the tilt of the fp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) they produce a variation in the velocity dispersion profile which may influence the measured @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite constructed detailed dynamical models of smaller samples of galaxies , reproducing in detail the photometry and long - slit spectroscopy observations .",
    "they also investigated the @xmath0 and concluded that the variations observed in the models are consistent with the observed fp tilt .",
    "however , the fact that the spread in their measured @xmath0 values was much larger than that in the fp , made the results inconclusive .    in this work",
    "we revisit what was done in the latter studies , with some crucial differences :    1 .   the quality of our data allows a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of the dynamical @xmath0 determinations ; for our galaxy sample ` sauron `  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper  i ) integral - field observations of the stellar kinematics are available , together with hst / wfpc2 and ground - based mdm photometry in the i - band ( which we reproduce in detail with our models including ellipticity variations ) , and reliable distances based on the surface brightness fluctuations ( sbf ) determinations by @xcite ; 2 .",
    "our sample was extracted from the ` sauron `  representative sample of ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter paper  ii ) , which spans a wide range in velocity dispersion and luminosity , and includes both bright and low - luminosity e and s0 galaxies ; 3 .",
    "in contrast to previous studies the axisymmetric modelling technique we use can also be applied to very flattened galaxies , or objects containing multiple photometric components .",
    "all this allows us to carefully estimate the intrinsic scatter in the correlations between the dynamical @xmath0 and other galaxy observables , and makes it possible to set tight constraints on the measured slopes , for stringent comparisons with previous fp results and predictions of galaxy formation theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    "we present the sample selection and the photometric and kinematical data used . in section  3 we describe the two - integral and three - integral dynamical models used to measure the @xmath0 . in section  4",
    "we study the correlation of the @xmath0 with global galaxy parameters .",
    "we discuss our results in section  5 and summarize our conclusions in section  6 .",
    "the set of galaxies we use for this work was extracted from the ` sauron `  sample of 48 e and s0 galaxies ( classification taken from * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter rc3 ) , which is representative of nearby bright early - type galaxies ( @xmath16 ; @xmath17 mag ) .",
    "as described in paper  ii , it contains 24 galaxies in each of the e and s0 subclasses , equally divided between ` cluster ' and ` field ' objects ( the former defined as belonging to the virgo cluster , the coma i cloud , or the leo i group , and the latter being galaxies outside these clusters ) , uniformly covering the plane of ellipticity , @xmath18 , versus absolute blue magnitude , @xmath19 .",
    "one of the requirements for the subsample defined in the present paper was the availability of an accurate distance determined using the sbf technique by @xcite .",
    "38 objects in the ` sauron `  sample satisfy this criterion .",
    "the second requirement was the availability of _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) photometry obtained with the wfpc2 in the @xmath2-band ( f814w ) .",
    "we selected this band because it is minimally affected by intrinsic dust effects and it is expected to trace well the bulk of the luminous mass in galaxies .",
    "35 galaxies satisfy this second criterion .",
    "the intersection between the two groups with sbf distances and @xmath2-band photometry leads to a sample of 29 galaxies . out of these galaxies",
    "we additionally eliminated the objects showing strong evidence of bars within the ` sauron `  field , from either the photometry ( see section  [ sec : mge ] ) or the kinematics .",
    "specifically we excluded the five galaxies ngc  1023 , ngc  2768 , ngc  3384 , ngc  3489 and ngc  4382 .",
    "we did not attempt to eliminate all possibly barred galaxies from our sample , but at least we excluded the objects for which it makes little sense to deproject the observed surface density under the assumption of axisymmetry and to fit an axisymmetric model , which has to produce a bi - symmetric velocity field aligned with the photometry .",
    "we added the special galaxy m32 , which is not part of the representative sample , to the remaining sample of 24 galaxies .",
    "this last object allows us to sample the low - luminosity end of our correlations , which by construction can not be accessed with galaxies from the main survey .",
    "this leads to a final sample of 25 galaxies .",
    "our photometric data consists of the hst / wfpc2/f814w images already mentioned , together with ground - based photometry obtained , in the same f814w filter , with the 1.3 m mcgraw - hill telescope at the mdm observatory on kitt peak . a relatively large field - of - view of 171@xmath20171",
    "was used for the mdm observations to provide good coverage of the outer parts of our galaxies and to allow for an accurate sky subtraction from the observed frames .",
    "the mdm images are part of a complete photometric survey of the ` sauron `  galaxies , and they will be described in detail elsewhere .",
    "we adopted the wfpc2 images as reference for the photometric calibration and rescaled the mdm images to the same level .",
    "for this we measured logarithmically - sampled photometric profiles on the two images , using circular apertures , after masking bright stars or galaxies within the field .",
    "the sky level of the wide - field ground - based image can be determined easily and accurately by requiring the profile to tend asymptotically to a power - law at large radii .",
    "this leaves two free parameters : the scaling ratio between the ground - based image and the wfpc2 image , and the sky level of the wfpc2 image .",
    "the two parameters were fitted by minimizing the relative error between the two photometric profiles in the region of overlap , while excluding the innermost 3  to avoid seeing effects ( top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "after the fit we merged the two sky - subtracted and scaled profiles into a single one , which was used for the determination of the global photometric parameters ( bottom panel in fig .  [ fig : profiles ] ) .    .",
    "the fit was performed in the region between the two vertical dotted lines , where the wfpc2 and mdm profiles overlap , while excluding the innermost 3  to avoid psf and saturation effects . _",
    "bottom panel : _ fit of a de vaucouleurs @xmath21 growth curve ( green solid line ) to the combined wfpc2@xmath22mdm observed aperture photometry ( diamonds ) .",
    "the two vertical dotted lines define the boundaries of the region that was included in the fit , which is limited to 200  to reduce uncertainties due to the sky subtraction and contamination from nearby galaxies or foreground stars .",
    "the solid vertical line marks the location of @xmath1.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we measured the half - light radius @xmath1 and total galaxy luminosity as in classic studies on the fp of early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , namely from a fit of a de vaucouleurs @xmath21 growth curve to the aperture photometry .",
    "the fit was generally restricted to radii @xmath23 where the growth curve is a good description of the observations .",
    "we also experimented with alternatives : ( i ) fitting a @xcite @xmath24 curve to the profile , ( ii ) fitting a @xmath24 growth curve to the aperture photometry , ( iii ) fitting a @xmath24 growth curve , with the value of @xmath25 fixed by a previous fit to the profile .",
    "we found that the values of @xmath1 obtained with different methods differ substantially in some cases .",
    "this is not too surprising as the determination is based on an extrapolation of the profile .",
    "we adopted the @xmath21 growth curve fit because it allows a direct comparison of our results with previous works on the fp in section  [ sec : fp ] .",
    "another advantage is that with a growth curve approach the profile does not have to be well described by the assumed parameterization , but one just tries to extrapolate the luminosity to infinite radius , starting from the outermost measured photometric points .",
    "this makes the measurement more robust and better reproducible than a profile - fitting approach .",
    "the measured values of the global photometric parameters are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "in this appendix ( tables b1b2 ) we present the ( distance independent ) numerical values of the analytically - deconvolved mge parametrization of the surface brightness of the galaxies in our sample .",
    "the constant - pa models were obtained by fitting the hst / wfpc2/f814w photometry at small radii and the ground - based mdm photometry ( in the same band ) at large radii .",
    "they provide an accurate description of the @xmath2-band surface brightness of the galaxies from @xmath26 to about twice the maximum @xmath27 used in each galaxy ( usually corresponding to 510 @xmath1 ) . the nucleus of ngc  4150 is heavily obscured by dust . for this galaxy",
    "we fitted the nuclear mge model to an hst / nicmos / f160w ( @xmath28-band ) image , which was rescaled to the wfpc2/f814w ( @xmath2-band ) one for calibration , neglecting possible @xmath29 color gradients .",
    "in other galaxies dust and bright foreground stars were simply excluded from the mge fit .",
    "the matching of the different images and the calibration adopted for the mge models is described in section  [ sec : mge ] .",
    "the deconvolved mge surface brightness @xmath30 is defined as follows : @xmath31 ,    \\label{eq : mge_surf}\\ ] ] where the model is composed by @xmath32 gaussian components of dispersion @xmath27 , axial ratio @xmath33 and peak intensity @xmath34 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath35 are measured on the sky plane , with the @xmath36-axis corresponding to the galaxy major axis .",
