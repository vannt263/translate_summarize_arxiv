    "a non - empty finite set together with a finite family of its subsets is called a hypergraph . the elements of the set",
    "are called vertices , and the members of the family are called edges of the given hypergraph .",

    "however , all the problems investigated here could also be considered for the unlabelled case , though most of them are unsolved by now .",

    "we suppose that , in general , two sets @xmath5 and @xmath6 of properties are given , and we consider ( both in an ordered and in an unordered case ) the class of all hypergraphs having all the properties from @xmath5 and having all the dual properties of the properties from @xmath6 .",
    "the properties we consider are : ` to be a cover ' , ` to be @xmath7-dimensional ' , ` to be @xmath7-uniform ' , ` to be without intersecting property ' , etc . , and , clearly , all possible combinations of these properties .",
    "our aim is to find how many hypergraphs of the class defined in such a way have @xmath0-property .",
    "we suggest a more general method for enumerating such classes .",
    "theorem [ trm1 ] , and its consequences theorems [ trm2 ] , [ trm3 ] , [ trm4 ] and [ trm5 ] , constitute the base of the method . for a larger part of the enumerations",
