    "nuclear spin - polarized @xmath0targets have proven to be exceptionally useful in electron scattering for measurements of spin - dependent observables involving the neutron .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ground - state @xmath0nuclear wave function is dominated by a configuration in which the proton spins are antialigned , and the spin of the @xmath0nucleus is , to a good approximation , given by the spin of its sole neutron .",
    "examples of the physics investigated using polarized @xmath0include the spin structure of the neutron  @xcite , the @xmath5 dependence of the generalized gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) integral  @xcite , the electric form factor of the neutron  @xcite , and single - spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis )  @xcite . these experiments , spanning almost two decades , have been made possible by significant advances in the performance of polarized @xmath0targets .",
    "these advances have been due to both an improved understanding of the underlying physics of the targets as well as technological advances including , for example , dramatic progress in the capabilities of commercially available lasers .",
    "spin - exchange optical pumping ( seop ) is one of two techniques that are widely used to spin polarize @xmath0for use as a nuclear target  @xcite .",
    "the other technique is metastability - exchange optical pumping  @xcite , but is not the subject of this work .",
    "first demonstrated in 1960  @xcite , seop is a two step process in which an alkali - metal ( or `` alkali '' for short ) vapor is polarized using optical pumping which subsequently polarizes noble - gas nuclei via spin - exchange collisions @xcite . historically , a pure rubidium ( @xmath6 ) vapor was used to polarize @xmath0for nuclear targets .",
    "however , both calculations  @xcite and measurements  @xcite have shown that potassium ( @xmath3 ) is far more efficient than @xmath6  at transferring its polarization to @xmath0nuclei .",
    "this led to the use of hybrid mixtures of @xmath6  and @xmath3  for improving the efficiency of the polarization process , a technique we will refer to as alkali - hybrid spin exchange optical pumping ( ahseop )  @xcite . in ahseop , the @xmath6  vapor is still polarized by optical pumping , but the @xmath6  polarization is then rapidly shared with the @xmath3 .",
    "the exchange of polarization between @xmath6  and @xmath3  atoms is sufficiently fast that the polarizations of the two vapors are nearly identical .",
    "if the alkali - hybrid mixture is chosen so that there is significantly more @xmath3  than @xmath6 , the spin - exchange efficiency is greatly improved even though it is still @xmath6  that is being optically pumped . for a given amount of laser power , the higher efficiency means that the rate at which @xmath0is polarized can be significantly increased .",
    "the use of ahseop has indeed had a dramatic effect on target performance .",
    "another factor that greatly improved performance was the introduction of spectrally - narrowed diode lasers @xcite , something that for several reasons boosts the maximum alkali polarization that is achievable and thereby also reduces the required laser power .",
    "we will discuss in some detail the impact on target performance of both ahseop and spectrally - narrowed diode lasers .    in this work ,",
    "we present data collected while developing and characterizing 24 glass target cells , each of which was constructed in preparation for one of four polarized @xmath0experiments performed in experimental hall a at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) in newport news , virginia .",
    "those experiments included the small angle gdh experiment ( e97 - 110 , referred to herein as sagdh , which ran in 2003 )  @xcite , a measurement of the electric form factor of the neutron , @xmath7 , at high @xmath5 ( e02 - 013 , referred to herein as gen , which ran in 2006 )  @xcite , an experiment to measure single - spin asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( e06 - 010 , referred to herein as transversity , which ran in late 2008 and early 2009 )  @xcite , and an experiment to measure the twist three matrix element @xmath8 ( e06 - 014 , referred to herein simply as @xmath8 , which ran in 2009 ) . in all cases the target cells included two chambers : a pumping chamber , in which the @xmath2he was polarized , and a target chamber , through which the electron beam passed .",
    "the two chambers were connected by a single  transfer tube \" through which the polarized @xmath2he diffused . all but the target cells made for the sagdh experiment utilized alkali - hybrid mixtures for improved performance .",
    "the results presented here document dramatic improvement in the performance of polarized @xmath0targets , as well as the target properties and operating parameters that made those improvements possible .",
    "the data include the @xmath0polarization achieved under various operating conditions , the time constants associated with the polarization process , and data characterizing the properties of the target cell itself , such as pressure , the ratio of @xmath3  to @xmath6  in the alkali - hybrid mixture , and spin - relaxation rates that are intrinsic to the cell . in roughly half",
    "the cells studied , we also measured the polarization and density of the alkali vapor using faraday rotation techniques . the results presented here",
    "summarize several thousand hours of data taking , and provide a valuable basis upon which to design and build the next generation of @xmath0targets .",
    "in addition to _ direct _ measurements of target - cell properties and target cell performance , it is possible to obtain a particular _ derived _ measurement of a cell property that is critical to target performance . in 2006 , babcock _ et al .",
    "_ reported evidence for a previously unrecognized spin - relaxation mechanism that limits the polarization when using seop to polarize @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this spin - relaxation mechanism is temperature dependent , and empirically , appears to be roughly proportional to the alkali density .",
    "the authors thus characterized the newly recognized spin - relaxation mechanism by a dimensionless parameter referred to simply as @xmath1 , and showed that the maximum polarization that can be achieved in a target is @xmath9 .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 can vary significantly from cell to cell , so it was important to us to measure @xmath1 in our target cells .",
    "we note that in the course of our studies we have observed what appears to be hints of a temperature dependence of the @xmath1 parameter , which would imply that the temperature dependence of the spin - relaxation mechanism characterized by @xmath1 is not exactly the same as the temperature dependence of the spin - exchange rate , a possibility that was indeed pointed out by babcock _",
    "et al .  _ in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "an illustration of the improvements that have been achieved is given by fig .",
    "[ fig : foms ] , in which two relevant figures of merit ( fom ) are plotted for five different target cells .",
    "one fom is the effective luminosity @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the usual luminosity for a fixed - target experiment ( i.e. the product of beam current , target density , and interaction length ) and @xmath12 is the @xmath2he polarization . the luminosity @xmath11 accounts for the actual number of scattering opportunites per unit time per unit area , whereas @xmath13 accounts for the reduction in the statistical precision of some polarization - dependant asymmetry that is sought after .",
    "the quantity that currently limits the number of scattering opportunities in the type of electron scattering experiments described earlier is the number of target spins that can polarized per unit time . in order to quantify the _ potential _ effective luminosity of a target ,",
    "we define another fom as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the total number of @xmath2he atoms in the target , and @xmath16 , defined by eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : gammas ] ) , is a rate that characterizes the buildup of polarization .",
    "[ fig : foms ] suggests that the target antoinette could tolerate even higher luminosities than have already been achieved , although this particular target was never used in beam .",
    "most of the data used to construct fig .",
    "[ fig : foms ] can be found in sections  [ sec : expmeth ] and [ sec : targetproperties ] .",
    "we have assumed , for the four cases shown , beam currents of 3.3 , 8 , 8 , and 12@xmath17 , and polarizations of 0.30 , 0.39 , 0.47 and 0.55 , respectively . ]",
    "-0.1truein    we note that the large values of @xmath18 observed in cells such as antoinette , suggesting untapped potential , inspired the development of a new style of target cell , described recently by dolph _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite , in which gas transfer between the pumping and target chambers is accomplished much more rapidly by using convection instead of diffusion .",
    "faster gas transfer is desirable because in experiments such as transversity ( which used the cell  astral \" in fig .",
    "[ fig : foms ] ) the high luminosity caused significant `` polarization gradients '' ( @xmath19 relative ) between the pumping and target chambers .",
    "without convection - based targets , the polarization gradients in several future approved experiments would be significantly more severe .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : theory ] by discussing the theory and rate equations underlying alkali - hybrid optical pumping , and a computer simulation that guided us in designing our targets .",
    "the simulation , which incorporates several important effects that influence the `` photon demand '' in our targets , provides a fairly realistic description of the optical pumping process , and insight regarding how to best optimize performance .",
    "it clearly shows , for example , the optimal range for the ratio of the @xmath3  to @xmath6  number density and the relationship of laser power & spectral width to target performance .",
    "the simulation also provides a valuable link between the `` line - averaged '' alkali polarization , which we accessed experimentally , and the `` volume - averaged '' alkali polarization , which is the important quantity in determining the @xmath0polarization . in section  [ sec : expmeth ] , we describe our experimental methods for both the construction of our target cells , including how we prepare alkali - hybrid mixtures , and our measurements . in section  [ sec : targetproperties ] , we present data on target performance and compare the observed trends to those evident in our simulations . in section  [ sec : kse ] , we use our data to extract a value of the rate constant that quantifies @xmath3-@xmath0spin exchange . in section",
    "[ sec : x ] , we present our studies of the @xmath0polarization - limiting spin - relaxation mechanism that is characterized by the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the spatial and spectral profile of the light used for optical pumping is modified nonlinearly as it propagates through the alkali vapor .",
    "when insufficient laser intensity or spectrally broad lasers are used for optical pumping , the optical pumping rate and , consequently , the alkali polarization can vary dramatically throughout the pumping chamber .",
    "ultimately , because the spin - exchange rate is relatively slow compared to the @xmath0diffusion rate , the @xmath0polarization depends only on the volume - averaged alkali polarization .",
    "a computer simulation was developed to better understand the influence of the various factors on the alkali polarization .",
    "we describe the underlying theory , simulation , and results below .      in what follows , the two main simplifying assumptions are ( 1 ) the alkali nuclear spin is fully conserved during the optical pumping cycle and ( 2 ) the alkali excited state multipole moments are zero .",

    "we found , however , that the uncertainties in @xmath245 and @xmath246 had only negligible effects on the observed temperature dependence of @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , as we analyzed our data , the identification and elimination of various systematic effects only caused the temperature dependence to become more pronounced while simultaneously decreasing the scatter in our data .",
