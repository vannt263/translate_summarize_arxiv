    "silicates and fe - metal making up terrestrial planets were melted one or more times during the accretionary stage before reaching the final size .",
    "giant collisions with bodies the size of mars or the moon could have melted and even partially vaporized the earth , which has been thought to be the most plausible process for the origin of the moon @xcite .",
    "giant impacts and subsequent magma oceans caused a greenhouse effect in the atmosphere and core formation in the interior because volatile elements were contained .",
    "magma oceans further caused compositional differentiation into mantle and crust , affected the concentration and distribution of volatile element , and controlled the thermal history of the planetary bodies @xcite .",
    "the solidification processes of magma oceans determine the initial compositional differentiation of the silicate portions of planets , whereas the processes of crystallization and differentiation in magma oceans of terrestrial planets are described with fluid dynamics @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that a low - viscosity , vigorously convecting magma ocean is more similar to the atmosphere rather than to the solid mantle .    whether growing mineral grains remain suspended in the melt or settle out",
    "is fundamental to the chemical evolution of a magma ocean .",
    "the process of solidification can be viewed simply as two end members , namely fractional solidification and batch solidification , with natural processes occurring between them .",
    "fractional solidification in a magma ocean requires separation of mineral grains from the flow and effective isolation from interaction with the remaining magma ocean liquids . however , batch solidification maintains the interaction of liquid and crystallized minerals throughout the solidification process .",
    "crystal settling is a fundamental process in a magma ocean of a small planetary body .",
    "crystallization occurs in all regions owing to the almost parallel temperature relationship between adiabat and liquidus , where the density contrast between minerals and liquid is of primary importance .",
    "although the densities of minerals and liquid depend on chemical composition , pressure , and temperature , the dependence differs between solid and liquid , which needs a chemical equilibrium calculation consistent with the fluid dynamics of the magma ocean .",
    "the fluid dynamics of a turbulent magma ocean include crystal separation , formation of a mush layer , and entrainment of those minerals into liquid .",
    "all of these processes are strongly affected by the size , shape , and mutual relationship of multiple minerals and are controlled by cooling of the magma ocean @xcite .",
    "asteroid 4 vesta is the only preserved intact example of a large , differentiated protoplanet @xcite .",
    "it has a basaltic crust , and observations with reflectance spectra have provided convincing evidence for a differentiated interior that includes an ultramafic mantle exposed in the cavity of a massive impact basin and a possible iron - rich core @xcite .",
    "the reflectance spectra of vesta show many similarities to those of howardite  eucrite  diogenite ( he d ) meteorites , where howardite is a breccia of eucrite and diogenite , eucrite is a basaltic achondorite , and diogenite is an orthopyroxenite .",
    "this suggests that vesta is the parent body of he d meteorites .",
    "geochemical , petrological , and geochronological studies have revealed that vesta was melted substantially possibly by the decay of @xmath0al and @xmath4fe .",
    "crystallization modeling of the magma ocean of vesta has produced an olivine mantle , a lower crust rich in diogenites , and an upper crust of basaltic flows and eucrites .",
    "recently , dawn spacecraft observed the surface mineralogy of vesta with the visible and infrared spectrometers ( virs ) , the latter of which revealed spatially resolved hyperspectral images of vesta @xcite .",
    "the results enabled us to estimate regionally localized mineralogical units suggestive of a complex geological and collisional history .    whether vesta was once melted entirely or",
    "partially remains controversial . and proposed a model of the entirely melted magma ocean and discussed whether the mode of crystallization was equilibrium or fractional . on the contrary ,",
    "discussed the difficulty of total melting of small bodies and suggested a model of partially melted mantle including the transport of @xmath0al , a critical heat source , to the upper portion .    in the present work",
    ", we investigate the evolution of the magma ocean at the final stage , and we focus on the roles of physical parameters affecting the evolution of the magma ocean , grain size of crystals , thickness of the lid , and fo@xmath1 .",
    "the grain size of crystals is related to the rate of crystal settling , which controls the rate of chemical differentiation .",
    "the thickness of the lid directly controls the cooling time scale of the magma ocean , and the composition of the minerals and melt varies with fo@xmath1 . in this study",
    ", we evaluate the roles of the three parameters on solidification of a magma ocean under a turbulent flow by consistently calculating the heat balance , settling of crystals , and chemical compositions of melt and crystals .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "a description of our model is given in section 2 , the results of the numerical simulation are shown in section 3 , and the results are discussed in section 4 . finally , we summarize our study in section 5 .",
    "in order to investigate the final evolution of the magma ocean of vesta , we developed a numerical model combining fluid dynamics and thermodynamics .",
    "a plausible range of parameters is constrained , which indicates an orthopyroxenite layer of considerable thickness in which the chemical composition is consistent with that of diogenites .      in this study",
    ", we assumed that the shape of vesta is spherical and that its interior had already been differentiated to form a core .",
    "the thickness of the core , the mantle , and the crust is often assumed to be 120 km , 80 km , and 50 km , respectively @xcite . after the core differentiated , the mantle of vesta was totally molten . with subsequent cooling , olivine crystallized and settled down to form the mantle .",
    "the melt of the partially molten mantle moved to the surface and formed a shallow magma ocean .",
    "the timing of the olivine extraction remains controversial .",
    "reported that the olivine extraction occurred after 80% equilibrium crystallization .",
    "however , estimated 6070% on the basis of @xcite .",
    "the magma ocean would , however , have been viscous enough to suppress the velocity of the convection before the regime .",
    "therefore , we assumed that the olivine extraction occurred after 55% equilibrium crystallization , and the remaining melt fraction , 45% , corresponds to the mass of the crust of vesta .",
    "the critical value was experimentally determined by @xcite , and @xcite , in which 55% is the most typical value .",
    "we set the initial value of the thickness of the shallow magma ocean as 50 km , which is close to that of the crust of vesta obtained by observation .",
    "the calculation of the present work began after the olivine extraction and the formation of the shallow magma ocean .",
    "the schematic illustration of the model is shown in figure [ model ] .",
    "furthermore , we considered the existence of a lid above the shallow magma ocean .",
    "although determined the thickness of the lid to be 250750 m , this estimation remains controversial .",
    "therefore , we varied the thickness of the lid as a parameter to be 1 km , 100 m , and 10 m. if the conductive lid is thick and evolves with time , the lid could have an influence on the chemistry of the magma ocean . in our study , the boundary layer was assumed to be quenched melt ; hence , the conductive lid did not influence the chemistry of the magma ocean because the lid and melt have the same composition .",
    "all of the parameters used in this model are summarized in table [ tb : parameter ] .",
    "the mass of vesta was determined from its perturbation by other asteroids , and the shape was derived from hubble space telescope images @xcite .",
    "the physical parameters of vesta summarized by @xcite were used in the present study .",
    "other physical parameters , thermal expansion , thermal capacity , @xmath0al half - life , and latent heat of the magma ocean were taken from @xcite and .      a convective layer of a fluid is generally described with dimensionless parameters , a rayleigh number ( @xmath5 ) , and a prandtl number ( @xmath6 ) , defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the thermal expansion and @xmath9 is the temperature of the shallow magma ocean .",
    "the temperature in the entire magma ocean can be regarded as being uniform during the cooling because the magma ocean is highly convective where the temperature profile is along the adiabatic profile and because the size of the planetary body is small enough for which the effect of pressure can be neglected .",
    "@xmath10 is the temperature of the top of the shallow magma ocean , i.e. , the bottom of the quenched lid .",
    "@xmath11 is the depth of the fluid layer , @xmath12 is the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath13 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "the rayleigh number characterizes the vigor of the convective flow , which is the ratio of the buoyancy to the viscosity and thermal diffusion .",
    "the convection becomes vigorous with an increase in the rayleigh number .",
    "the prandtl number is the ratio of kinematic viscosity to the thermal diffusivity and measures the effectiveness of thermal diffusion in regulating the flow .",
    "convection has two regimes : soft turbulence and hard turbulence @xcite .",
    "their heat fluxes are described as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the aspect ratio for the mean flow @xcite .",
    "these modes of convection change according to the magnitude of the rayleigh number .",
    "we determined whether the turbulence is soft or hard according to the condition reported by @xcite : @xmath16    when condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) is satisfied , the mode of convection changes from soft to hard .",
    "this change in the convection mode affects the rate of cooling . in our model ,",
    "the rayleigh number is @xmath17 at the beginning and decreases with cooling .",
    "when the crystal fraction of the shallow magma ocean reaches @xmath310% , depending on the parameters , the relationship between the rayleigh number and the prandtl number no longer satisfies the condition ( [ eq : condition ] ) , and the mode of the convection changes to soft .",
    "the heat flux of the convection must match the conductive heat flux propagating the lid , which is expressed as fourier s law : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the thickness of the lid above the magma ocean , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the temperature of the upper part of the quenched crust . the heat flux of the conduction must match the surface heat flux , which can be calculated with the help of the blackbody radiation : @xmath22 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : soft ] ) , ( [ eq : hard ] ) , ( [ eq : conduction ] ) , and ( [ eq : stefan ] ) , we solve the temporal evolution of the temperature of the magma ocean . the initial temperature of the magma ocean t is defined by the bottom and the surface temperatures .",
    "the bottom temperature is defined by the appearance of pyroxene when the magma ocean depth decreases to 50 km , which corresponds to 1670 k. we calculated the @xmath23 and @xmath24 computed by equating the blackbody radiation with the conductive heat flux and convective flux .",
    "we fixed the time step at 100 years and solved the four equations so that each flux was equivalent at each boundary by newton s method .",

    "the distribution of @xmath0al was assumed to be the same as that of al .",
    "the distribution of al is described by calculation of the melts program , as shown below .",
    "we neglected the heat flux from the core and the mantle in our model .",
    "we calculated the phase relations from the liquidus to solidus temperature by using the melts program @xcite .",
    "melts , a software package designed to facilitate the thermodynamic modeling of phase equilibria in natural magmatic systems , was constructed by optimizing nearly 2500 solid  liquid experiments .",
    "we assumed that the composition of the magma ocean of vesta after core formation is a silicate portion of l - chondrite after , which is shown in the first column of table [ tb : composition ] .",
    "the initial composition for the present model calculation was obtained by crystallization and extraction of olivine at fo@xmath1 @xmath34 quartz  fayalite  magnetite ( qfm ) @xmath35 , qfm @xmath36 , and iron  wustite ( iw ) by melts until the depth of the magma ocean decreased to 50 km , which are shown in table [ tb : composition ] .",
    "the magma ocean was regarded to be uniform in terms of chemical composition because it is vigorously convective .",
    "the crystal separation rate from the turbulently convective fluid , as discussed by @xcite , assumes the following : ( a)the crystals are distributed homogeneously in the flow ; ( b)there is no re - entrainment of crystals into the flow once they have settled out ; ( c)crystals influence neither each other nor the nature of the melt ; and ( d)the grain size is uniform .",
    "we applied their model to our crystal separation model , as shown in eqs .",
    "( 10)(16 ) .",

    "we performed these calculations by varying the value of the diameter of the crystal , the thickness of the conductive lid , and @xmath59 as parameters .",
    "the temporal change in temperature of the magma ocean and the thickness of the cumulate layer are shown in figs .",
    "[ lid ] and [ particle ] .",
    "it should be noted that our calculation began at the time of orthopyroxene appearance in the residual magma ocean after mantle olivine separation .",
    "figure [ lid ] shows the change in magma ocean temperature ( a ) and the growth of the cumulate layer ( b ) where the crystal size is fixed at 0.1 cm and fo@xmath1 at iw with the thickness of the conductive lid being a parameter from 10 m to 1 km . the crystalline phase for forming the cumulate layer is orthopyroxene , which will be subsequently discussed in detail .",
    "the rate of temperature decrease is strongly dependent on the thickness of the lid , as shown in fig .",
    "a lid 10 m thick cools to near the solidus temperatures within a few tens of thousands of years , although the cooling is much slower with a lid 1 km thick .",
    "rapid temperature decrease with a thin lid is no surprise because the conductive heat flux increases as the lid becomes thinner .",
    "the thickness of the cumulate layer increases as the conductive lid becomes thinner , which is directly related to the cooling of the magma ocean , as shown in fig .",
    "the magma ocean cools very slowly with a thick lid ; consequently , the growth rate of the cumulate layer is small .",
    "however , this tendency is the case only for the early stage of magma ocean crystallization .",
    "as time passes , the magma ocean with a thicker lid makes a thicker cumulate layer .",
    "figure [ lid ] indicates that the thickening of a lid prolongs the evolution time of the magma ocean such as the growth time of a cumulate layer as far as the grain size of crystals are independent of the cooling time scale .",
    "the role of the grain size of minerals is shown in fig .",
    "[ particle ] , for which the diameter of the crystals varied from 0.01 cm to 1 cm with a fixed lid thickness of 100 m and fo@xmath1 at the iw buffer .",
    "figure [ particle]a shows the cooling of the magma ocean , and fig .",
    "[ particle]b shows the temporal change in the thickness of the cumulate layer .",
    "the magma ocean cools with similar rates for the three cases ( fig .",
    "[ particle]a ) ; however , the thickness of the cumulate layer differs significantly .",
    "the cumulate layer thickness varies by two orders of magnitude with a difference in grain size by one order , which is attributed to the difference in the settling velocity ( eqs .",
    "[ eqn : stokes ] and [ eqn : martin2 ] ) .",
    "figure [ particle]b shows that the crystals with diameters of 0.01 cm ( the blue line in fig .",
    "[ particle ] ) hardly settle down to form a cumulate layer ; that is , most of the crystals are suspended in the magma ocean .",
    "figure [ particle]a shows that the magma ocean with crystal diameters of 1 cm cooled faster than those with smaller sizes , whereas those with diameters of 0.1 cm and 0.01 cm showed no difference in the cooling rate . with a diameter of 1 cm , hard",
    "turbulence changes to soft at 1537 k. if a large number of crystals is settled out , the magma ocean becomes thinner , resulting in an increase in the cooling rate .",
    "no difference in the cooling rate between diameters of 0.1 cm and 0.01 cm means that the crystal separation rate is very slow compared with the cooling rate .    in summary ,",
    "crystallization proceeds almost as a batch process , maintaining chemical equilibrium between crystals and melt if the size of the crystals is smaller than @xmath31 mm . on the contrary , the magma ocean cools rapidly and chemical fractionation is effective if the crystal size is larger than @xmath31 cm even if the lid is @xmath3100 m thick .",
    "therefore , the size of crystals plays a crucial role in the evolution of the magma ocean .      in this section",
    ", we show the chemical aspects of our calculation . as previously shown in fig .",
    "[ particle ] , the physical parameters of the magma ocean , specifically the grain size of crystals , largely affect the evolution of the magma ocean . this in turn affects the chemical compositions of the minerals and melts . figure [ phase ] shows the temporal phase change of the magma ocean after the appearance of orthopyroxene .",
    "it should be noted again that a significant amount of olivine has already crystallized before this point .",
    "moreover , the fraction in the vertical scale represents the relative amount of minerals and melt in the uppermost 50 km at the beginning and less at the later stage , which is shown in figs .",

    "oxygen fugacity is qfm at 200 bar for all four panels .",
    "it should be noted that fig .",
    "[ phase]a and [ phase]b are expressed in the same time scale , but fig .",
    "[ phase]c and fig .",

    "figures [ phase]a and [ phase]b , which have the same lid thickness with different crystal sizes , are similar , suggesting similar chemical evolution of the magma ocean .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that there is little difference in the cooling speed and the rate of crystal settling for the two cases , as shown in fig .",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ phase]c is quite different from fig .",
    "[ phase]a and [ phase]b , where the amount of orthopyroxene does not increase with time and is replaced by clinopyroxene after a considerable time . a comparison of figs .",
    "[ particle]b and [ phase]c reveals that most of orthopyroxene crystallized settled down to the bottom of the magma ocean and that the residual magma ocean retained very small numbers of crystals , as shown in fig .",
    "[ phase]c . the large melt area ( blue ) in fig .",
    "[ phase]c does not represent the delay of crystallization , which cools rather rapidly as shown in fig .",
    "[ particle]a .",
    "figures [ phase]a , [ phase]b , and [ phase]c compare the role of grain size on the chemical evolution and reveal that the effective extraction of orthopyroxene for the case of large grain size ( fig .",
    "[ phase]c ) put the appearance of clinopyroxene ahead .",
    "a thick lid did not affect the process significantly , with minor differences in the consumption of orthopyroxene and the appearance of clinopyroxene ( straight boundary between red and purple in fig .",
    "[ phase]d ) .    from these results , we determined a strong dependence of the crystal settling and cooling rate on the crystal size .",
    "as time progressed , orthopyroxene crystallization stopped , and clinopyroxene began to appear .",
    "we will discuss the formation of orthopyroxenite and the dependence on parameters in the following section .",
    "in this section , we discuss the evolution of the magma ocean of 4 vesta and compare our model with previous models .      the mineral phases and their abundance ratios in the cumulate layer are the same as those in the residual magma ocean in the present model because all of the minerals are assumed to have the same grain size , resulting in settling and maintaining their relative abundance ratios .",
    "therefore , most of the cumulate layer is orthopyroxenite with small amounts of pyroxenite and clinopyroxenite . the sharp boundary between orthopyroxene and clinopyroxene in figs . [ phase]c and",
    "[ phase]d suggests that pyroxenite is almost lacking in these cases .    in terms of the diogenite formation ,",
    "the key point is the amount of orthopyroxene settled .",
    "it is important to note that orthopyroxene settles in the residual magma ocean in the early period of the crystallization .",
    "our objective is to determine how the orthopyroxene crystallizes , settles , and forms a cumulate layer in the crystallization processes .",

    "fo@xmath1 does not have a crucial influence on the formation of the orthopyroxene cumulates .    as shown above , crystal size and thickness of the conductive lid",
    "critically influence the evolution of the magma ocean .",
    "the presence of diogenites ( orthopyroxenites ) requires the formation of an orthopyroxene cumulate layer with considerable thickness in vesta , which was later broken up to be delivered to the earth .",
    "our simulation suggests that small ( @xmath30.01 cm ) crystals can not form a layer of orthopyroxene - dominated cumulate owing to the difficulty in settling in a turbulent magma ocean regardless of the lid thickness and fo@xmath1 .",
    "although a thick cumulate layer of @xmath320 km is formed with crystal diameters of 1 cm , the assumption of a uniform crystal size in the magma ocean would not be feasible .",
    "it is argued that crystals in a magma ocean are likely to be between 0.01 cm and 1 cm in diameter @xcite . in such a case , 1 cm would be the maximum size .",
    "although 1 cm crystals form a thick cumulate layer in a short duration , those 0.1 cm in size can form a cumulate layer @xmath310 km thick when the conductive lid is as thick as 1 km .",
    "the efficiency of the settling will increase if mechanisms are present that lower the cooling speed , such as thick atmosphere formation caused by impact .",
    "the chemical composition of orthopyroxene in the cumulate layer is another crucial factor .",

    "the minimum mg@xmath2 of the orthopyroxene varied from 0.70 to 0.50 according to the parameters .",
    "although fo@xmath1 had little influence on the mg@xmath2 , the thickness of the lid and the grain size affect the mg@xmath2 greatly",
    ". a thinner lid of 10 m with larger particles of 1 cm will produce a low mg@xmath2 because a thinner lid and larger particles accelerate the settling of the particles .",
    "as a result , mg is preferentially incorporated into orthopyroxene in the magma ocean even after the crystallization of olivine , and the mg@xmath2 quickly decreases . little difference was noted in the compositional evolution of orthopyroxene for the cases of 0.1 cm and 0.01 cm , which is also consistent with the fact that the settling and cumulate layer thickening were almost the same for the two grain sizes .",
    "it should be noted that this is the case only when the conductive lid is thin .",
    "if the lid is thicker than 1 km , a considerable difference is exhibited .",
    "previous research has shown that the mg@xmath2 of diogenites varies between 0.74 and 0.80 ( black solid line in fig .",

    "they used a spherically symmetric one - dimensional model that considered accretion , compaction , and melting .",
    "a shallow magma ocean with one to a few tens of kilometers was formed , and its lifetime was 10@xmath6610@xmath67 years . they claimed that cumulate eucrites and diogenites might form through crystallization of the shallow magma ocean .",
    "although they did not consider the chemical composition , our results support their shallow magma ocean model .",
    "our model has an advantage that fluid dynamics , thermal history , and chemical evolution of the vesta magma ocean are consistently solved .",
    "moreover , we showed that orthopyroxenite with a chemical composition consistent with diogenites is successfully reproduced through differentiation of the shallow magma ocean at a later stage with a limited range of cumulate crystal grain sizes and the thickness of the lid .",
    "we determined an appropriate condition of the magma ocean of vesta for producing a thick orthopyroxenite layer by varying the size of the particles , the thickness of the conductive lid , and the @xmath59 as parameters .",
    "a plausible grain size is 1 cm , which produces a cumulate layer as thick as 1020 km .",
    "the thickness of the conductive lid is another critical constraint . if the thickness of the lid is 1 km an orthopyroxenite layer of @xmath320 km is produced when the particle size is 1 cm .",
    "the redox state is also important for diogenite formation .",
    "although it has little influence on the thickness of the cumulate layer , it should be fairly reducing ; @xmath59 at qfm or lower than two orders of magnitude would be desirable , which is consistent with observation and measurements .",
    "our model concludes that the grain size of settled orthopyroxene was as large as 1 cm and that the lid was as thick as 1 km in the late stage of the magma ocean of vesta .",
