    "<S> solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos have provided compelling evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations , implying non - zero neutrino masses @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> solar neutrino oscillations indicate a mass squared difference @xmath0 while atmospheric neutrino oscillations suggest @xmath1 further , attributing the lsnd anomaly to neutrino oscillations implies the existence of a fourth neutrino , a sterile one , with a mass above 1 ev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> cosmology offers further insights on the neutrino mass scales@xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is inevitable that neutrinos have participated in gravitational clustering around massive galaxies , constituting part of the dark matter . </S>",
    "<S> our purpose is to investigate the neutrino clustering effect , obtaining information on the cosmological presence of massive neutrinos .    </S>",
    "<S> the universe today exhibits structure on many scales . </S>",
    "<S> galaxies range in mass , with most bright galaxies having masses of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the sizes and distributions of present - day galaxies reflect the spectrum of initial density fluctuations , seeded by random motion or cosmic strings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that each galaxy attracts the cosmological neutrinos in its neighbourhood , creating a neutrino halo of an average mass @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> our idealized galaxy consists of a spherical massive core ( of a mass @xmath4 and a radius @xmath5 of few kpc ) surrounded by a spherical neutrino halo . </S>",
    "<S> hydrostatic equilibrium prevails @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the neutrino density , m is the neutrino mass and @xmath8 is the pressure of the neutrino gas . </S>",
    "<S> considering that the neutrinos form a degenerate fermi gas we obtain a polytrope rquation @xmath9 with the degeneracy factor @xmath10 ( left - handed neutrinos and right - handed antineutrinos ) . </S>",
    "<S> equs.([eq-1 ] ) and ( [ eq-2 ] ) lead to @xmath11 introducing the ( dimensionless ) variables p and x through @xmath12    @xmath13    @xmath14    equ.([eq-3 ] ) becomes    @xmath15    the variable p is related to the gravitational potential @xmath16 through @xmath17 @xmath18 is the gravitational potemtial at the outer part of the galaxy , where the density vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the numerical solution of equ.([eq-7 ] ) always provides a finite @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the radius @xmath21 of the galaxy is then @xmath22 ( equ.([eq-5 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass of the galaxy ( @xmath23 ) is related to the derivative of @xmath24 at @xmath19 by @xmath25 at @xmath26 the boundary condition is @xmath27 equation ( [ eq-7 ] ) together with the boundary conditions ( [ eq-9 ] ) and ( [ eq-10 ] ) , represents a loaded polytrope @xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar mathematical structures appear in the study of a galactic nucleus , a neutron star , or in the thomas - fermi description of an atom .    </S>",
    "<S> we solved numerically equ.([eq-7 ] ) , using the boundary condition of equ.([eq-10 ] ) and an arbitrary positive value for the derivative of @xmath24 at @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical solution provides a function @xmath24 which rises up to a maximum , then decreases until it vanishes at some point @xmath19 @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluated also the derivative of @xmath24 in the neighbourhood of @xmath19 and subsequently the left - hand side of equ.([eq-9 ] ) , thus determining the ratio @xmath30 . to obtain the desired ratio @xmath30 , we repeat the numerical evaluation with a different value for the derivative of @xmath24 at @xmath31 , until we achieve the predetermined @xmath30 ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical study revealed the following essential features of the loaded polytrope :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the precise value of @xmath19 is largely independent of the ratio @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> more massive neutrino halos provide larger values for the maximum of @xmath24 , but all neutrino densities vanish in the vicinity of @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the radius r of the galaxy is set up by the constant q ( equs.([eq-5 ] ) and ( [ eq-6 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> the scale q , equ.([eq-6 ] ) , is very sensitive to the mass of neutrino m. by increasing the mass of the neutrino by a factor 3 , the size of the galaxy is reduced by a factor 19 . </S>",
    "<S> the overall data are well reproduced with a neutrino mass at 10 ev . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   equ.([eq-6 ] ) gives then the numerical expression @xmath33 for a massive core @xmath34 , we obtain @xmath35 and therefore @xmath36 , in agreement with the data for the size of massive galaxies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is impressive that a scale q which is expressed in terms of fundamental constants , such as the planck constant , the neutrino mass and the newton constant , reproduces accurately the galactic sizes . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   through equ.([eq-4 ] ) we obtain back the neutrino density @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that at small distances , @xmath7 behaves as @xmath37 while the neutrino density diverges as @xmath38 , the total neutrino mass @xmath39 remains finite .    </S>",

    "<S> 1 shows the neutrino density as a function of the rescaled distance x. the upper curve corresponds to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , while the lower curve corresponds to @xmath40 , @xmath42 . near the galactic core , </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino density is high as @xmath43 neutrinos/@xmath44 , and over the uniform density of the big - bang cosmology , the gravitational clustering provides locally an increase by a factor @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> the spherical neutrino halo up to a rescaled distance x , gives a mass @xmath46 , where @xmath47^{3/2}dy.\\label{eq-13}\\ ] ] obviously @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the galactic rotational velocity , due to the neutrino halo , is then @xmath49 fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows the galactic rotation curves ( upper curve corresponds to @xmath40 , @xmath41 , lower curve corresponds to @xmath40 , @xmath42 ) and there is agreement with the trends of the experimental data .    </S>",
    "<S> we may reach our findings by making appeal to an even simpler model@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a gravitational potential well of the size of the galactic halo is filled up with neutrinos , which are treated like a fermi - dirac gas at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the total number of neutrinos is related to the fermi momentum , itself determined by the minimum kinetic energy required for the neutrino to escape from the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> it is found then that the radius of the galaxy is @xmath50 , in full agreement with our results .    </S>",
    "<S> is it possible to detect the cosmological relic neutrinos ? </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational clustering effect we studied here , enhances the local densities , however the average neutrino energy is very small and the corresponding weak cross - section ( of the order of @xmath51 @xmath52 ) renders detection by conventional means highly unlikely @xcite .    the few ev mass scale for the sterile neutrino , that our study suggests , fits nicely with the findings of the reactor and short - based neutrino oscillation experiments@xcite . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the cosmological verdict for a few ev - mass sterile neutrino is rather unclear . </S>",
    "<S> the standard @xmath53 framework provides the constraint @xmath54 ev . a modified though @xmath53 cosmology , with additional radiation , </S>",
    "<S> can accommodate a few ev neutrino@xcite . in another direction , </S>",
    "<S> there is strong evidence for the existence of a 17 kev massive neutrino@xcite-@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence of distinct mass scales for the neutrinos , sub - ev , ev and kev , indicates the complexity of neutrino physics . </S>",
    "<S> clearly we need further experimental information and novel theoretical insights to decode the hidden dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> in summary we presented a simplified model for the gravitational clustering of massive neutrinos in the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> there is no adjustable parameter in our analysis and despite its simplicity the overall features of galactic dynamics are reproduced .    </S>",
