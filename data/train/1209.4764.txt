    "the macroscopic properties of the steady uniform shear flow ( usf ) of monocomponent granular gases have been extensively studied @xcite . the required quantities to close the exact balance equations for the hydrodynamic fields , density , velocity , and internal energy or temperature , are the pressure tensor and the cooling rate , since the heat flux vanishes .",
    "explicit expressions for all the components of the pressure tensor for arbitrary values of the shear rate have been obtained in the literature by using kinetic theory ideas .",
    "in addition , particle simulation methods , molecular dynamics ( md ) and direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc ) techniques , have been employed , and the agreement found between the theoretical predictions and the simulation results can be considered as quite satisfactory . on the other hand , in all the theories we are aware of , no rheological effects for the cooling rate have been reported . actually ,",
    "approximate expressions corresponding to zeroth order in the gradients , i.e. in the shear rate , are always considered .",
    "although it seems that the cooling rate of the steady usf state has never been directly measured in the simulations , the accuracy of the predictions for the steady temperature provides strong support for the smallness of the corrections to the cooling rate due to the finite shear rate .    in this work , the focus is put on the stochastic description of a global property of a granular gas in the steady usf state , namely the total internal energy .",
    "studying fluctuations requires using a mesoscopic description of the hydrodynamics of the system , instead of the macroscopic description provided by the usual hydrodynamic equations . in the case of molecular fluids at equilibrium ,",
    "the standard mesoscopic theory is the fluctuating hydrodynamics proposed by landau and lifshitz @xcite .",
    "this theory has been extended to systems out of equilibrium , mainly in the context of the navier - stokes order , although particular states beyond it have also been addressed @xcite .",
    "recently , a theory for hydrodynamic fluctuations in an isolated dilute granular gas in the homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) has been developed by extending the methods of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics for molecular gases @xcite .",
    "the results are expressed as langevin - like equations for the fluctuating density , velocity , and internal energy fields , that generalize those by landau and lifshitz .",
    "the derived equations are not directly applicable to other ( inhomogeneous ) states of a granular gas and , in particular , to the steady usf state .",
    "then , what is done in the present work is to formulate , without proof , a generalization of the theory in ref .",
    "@xcite based in two main assumptions :    \\(i ) the stochastic deviations of the hydrodynamic fields from their average values in the steady usf state verify the linearization of the general macroscopic hydrodynamic equations around that state , supplemented by a fluctuating random force term , i.e. they obey a set of coupled linear langevin equations .",
    "\\(ii ) the random force terms in the above equations follow from the fluctuating parts of the constitutive relations and also from the intrinsic noise induced by the energy dissipation in collisions .",
    "it is assumed that both noise sources have the same properties as for the hcs , with the only difference that the macroscopic quantities associated to the hcs have to be replaced by their values in the steady usf state .",
    "these two assumptions are prompted and stimulated by the results found in molecular fluids , where similar properties have been derived by different methods and have proven to be useful in many different situations @xcite . since general hydrodynamic equations are only available to navier - stokes order , the study of fluctuations around the steady usf state has to be restricted to that order .",
    "consequently , the results obtained can only be expected to hold for small gradients , that for the steady usf state also means small inelasticity , due to the coupling between gradients and inelasticity that is characteristic of steady states of granular systems .",
    "the work presented here must be clearly differentiated from other studies in which fluctuations of driven granular gases , in contact with some external energy source or thermal bath , have been considered @xcite .",
    "the latter influences the stochastic properties of the granular gas in a nontrivial way and , consequently , it is not clear the relationship between fluctuations in granular systems with and without an external source of noise .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the macroscopic properties of the steady usf state of a granular gas are shortly reviewed , and the theory of fluctuations around that state is formulated .",
    "the navier - stokes order of approximation is considered , since this is the order at which the fluctuating hydrodynamic equations around the homogeneous cooling state are known .",
    "the application of the theory to the total internal energy of the steady usf state is presented in sec .",
    "the fluctuating energy deviations from the macroscopic values obey a linear langevin equation with a non - white noise .",
    "this equation is used in sec .",
    "[ s4 ] to compute the energy fluctuations , as well as the two - time correlation function .",
    "the theoretical results are compared with molecular dynamics simulations of a two - dimensional system of hard disks .",
    "good agreement is found in the quasi - elastic limit , with increasing discrepancy as the inelasticity increases , as expected .",
    "the final section contains some general conclusions and comments .",
    "some of the technical details of the calculations are given in two appendices .",
    "consider a granular gas composed of smooth inelastic hard spheres ( @xmath0 ) or disks ( @xmath1 ) of mass @xmath2 and diameter @xmath3 .",
    "the macroscopic balance equations for the number density @xmath4 , velocity @xmath5 , and internal energy density @xmath6 , at position @xmath7 and time @xmath8 are @xcite @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the pressure tensor , @xmath13 is the heat flux , and @xmath14 is the cooling rate , the latter following from the energy dissipation in collisions . equations ( [ 2.1])-([2.3 ] ) become a closed set of differential equations for the fields @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , once @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are expressed as functionals of them by means of the constitutive relations .",
    "then , the equations provide a macroscopic or hydrodynamic description of the granular gas , whose domain of validity is determined by that of the constitutive relations .",
    "the steady uniform , or simple , shear flow ( usf ) state of a granular gas is characterized by time - independent and uniform number and internal energy densities , and a velocity field given by @xmath21 here , summation over repeated indexes is implicit , @xmath22 is the kronecker delta symbol , and @xmath23 for @xmath1 , while @xmath24 for @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the velocity profile is linear with a constant shear rate @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , the heat flux @xmath19 vanishes . for this steady flow , eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) becomes an identity , eq .",
    "( [ 2.2 ] ) implies that the pressure tensor is uniform , and eq .",
    "( [ 2.3 ] ) reduces to @xmath26 in a hydrodynamic description , @xmath27 is a given function of @xmath25 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( [ 2.5 ] ) expresses the steady internal energy density as a function of the number density and the shear rate . in a compact notation ,",
    "the hydrodynamic equations following from eqs.([2.1])-([2.3 ] ) plus some constitutive relations can be expressed as @xmath30.\\ ] ] with @xmath31 $ ] being a nonlinear space functional of the fields @xmath32 .",
    "the notation indicates that all the space and time dependence on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ 2.6 ] ) is entirely determined from the fields themselves .",
    "consider now the fluctuating mesoscopic fields @xmath33 whose stochastic average , denoted by angular brackets , are the macroscopic fields @xmath34 , @xmath35 and introduce the deviations @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the value of @xmath38 in the steady usf state .",
    "then , it is assumed that the deviations @xmath39 obey langevin - like equations of the form @xmath40 + { \\mathcal f}_{\\beta}({\\bm r},t),\\ ] ] with @xmath41 being a linear term which is related to the hydrodynamic equations by @xmath42 = \\int d{\\bm r}^{\\prime}\\ , \\left ( \\frac{\\delta \\phi_{\\beta}\\left [ { \\bm r},t|\\left\\ { c_{\\gamma } \\right\\ } \\right ] } { \\delta c_{\\lambda } ( { \\bm r}^{\\prime},t ) } \\right)_{\\ { c_{\\gamma}\\}= \\ { c_{\\gamma}^{(0)}\\ } } \\ ,   { \\mathcal c}_{\\lambda}^{\\prime}({\\bm r}^{\\prime},t).\\ ] ] moreover , it is also assumed that the noise terms @xmath43 can be identified from the fluctuating parts of the constitutive relations and the intrinsic fluctuations , both evaluated in the hcs .",
    "the only change to be made is the replacement of the macroscopic properties of the hcs by their values in the steady usf state",
    ".    equation ( [ 2.9 ] ) provides a complete formal theoretical scheme to study hydrodynamic fluctuations in the steady usf state of a granular gas .",
    "nevertheless , a difficulty arises when trying to implement it .",
    "although the macroscopic state of the system is known , at least approximately , to all orders in the shear rate , to get a similar knowledge of the fluctuations and correlations , the most general hydrodynamic equations , i.e. valid for arbitrarily large gradient of all the hydrodynamic fields , should be available .",
    "since this is not the case , attention will be limited in the following to the navier - stokes order .",
    "this restricts the expected validity of the theory to small values of the shear rate @xmath25 and , due to the coupling between @xmath44 and @xmath25 implied by eq .",
    "( [ 2.5 ] ) to values of the coefficient of normal restitution close to unity .    for a dilute gas and keeping only terms up to first order in the gradients of the hydrodynamic fields ,",
    "the constitutive relations are given by @xcite @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the hydrodynamic pressure , @xmath49 is the granular temperature , @xmath50 is the shear viscosity , @xmath51 the ( thermal ) heat conductivity , and @xmath52 the diffusive heat conductivity , which vanishes in the elastic limit .",

    "the specific property to be studied in this paper is the fluctuating total internal energy of the system .",
    "more precisely , the quantity considered is @xmath62 defined by @xmath63 where the integral extends over the volume ( for @xmath0 ) or area ( for @xmath1 ) @xmath64 of the system and @xmath65 is the fluctuating internal energy density .",
    "the deviation @xmath66 is assumed to obey the corresponding particularization of eq .",
    "( [ 2.9 ] ) .",
    "the equation for @xmath62 follows by integration over the volume ( or area ) of the system . at this point ,",
    "the boundary conditions play quite a relevant role , as it is also the case even in molecular systems at equilibrium . for the purposes of the study being presented here , periodic boundary conditions in the lagrangian frame moving with the local macroscopic velocity field are a very convenient choice . first , because they are the boundary conditions consistent with the ones used in the numerical simulations that will be reported later on to test the accuracy of the theoretical predictions .",
    "the second and more fundamental reason is that they lead to a decoupling of the equation for @xmath62 from the equations for the fluctuating number of particles and velocity , so that the former obeys a closed simple langevin - like equation .",
    "the details of the calculations are given in appendix [ apa ] , while only the result will be reported here .",
    "the equation obeyed by @xmath67 reads @xmath68 a dimensionless time scale @xmath69 has been introduced , defined by @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 the parameter @xmath73 is proportional to the mean free path of the gas and @xmath74 is a thermal velocity .",
    "then , it is easily seen that @xmath69 is proportional to the average accumulated number of collisions per particle in the time interval between @xmath75 and @xmath8 .",

    "( [ 4.9 ] ) ) .",
    "the comparison is carried out in fig .",
    "again , a good agrement is found for small inelasticity and an evident systematic discrepancy shows up as the coefficient of restitution decreases .",
    "it is worth to remark that in this case the theoretical prediction can not be improved by incorporating in a trivial way rheological effects , as done above for the energy fluctuations .",
    "it has already been indicated that there are strong evidence that rheological corrections to the cooling rate , if any , are not relevant .",
    "the consequence seems to be that some new physical effects must be incorporated into the theory to extend it to the not small inelasticity region .",
    "in this paper , a recent theory of fluctuations and correlations for a dilute granular gas in the homogeneous cooling state @xcite has been extended in a nontrivial way to a system in the steady uniform shear flow state .",
    "the extension has been carried out by similarity to what happens in molecular systems . from the theory ,",
    "predictions have been derived for the second moment of the internal energy fluctuations and also for its two - time correlation function .",
    "they have been compared with molecular dynamics simulation results , and good agreement has been found in the small inelasticity region , while discrepancies become evident and systematic as the inelasticity increases .",
    "this was expected , as the theory is formulated at the level of the navier - stokes order of approximation , and limitation to small gradients also implies limitation to small inelasticity , because of the coupling between both parameters in the steady usf state .",
    "nevertheless , there is a conceptually relevant difference between fluctuations and time correlations .",
    "while in the former , the role played by rheological effects can be easily foreseen , for instance through the viscosity , in the latter non - newtonian effects seem to be negligible for the cooling rate , that is the quantity governing the rate of decay to navier - stokes order .",
    "therefore , some new physical effects are needed to explain the failure of the theory to describe the decay of the energy time correlation function for high and moderate inelasticity .",
    "in particular , this requires to consider the transport coefficients characterizing the response of the system to small perturbations of the steady shear state @xcite .",
    "it is worth to stress the two main differences of the langevin equation for the total internal energy of the steady usf state as compared with similar equations for equilibrium molecular states .",
    "firstly , the noise source term coming from the fluctuating part of the pressure tensor is not delta correlated in time , i.e. the noise is not white .",
    "secondly , there is another noise term that is intrinsic to the energy dissipation and vanishes in the elastic limit .",
    "both terms are relevant , in the sense of leading to non - negligible contributions to the energy fluctuations and time correlations .",
