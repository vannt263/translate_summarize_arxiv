    "<S> the particle has enough time to enclose all possible solid angles with equal probability . </S>",
    "<S> these plots give the answer to the question that was raised in the beginning of the paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the analytical solution given above was checked against the results of computer experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion process was simulated on a silicon graphics workstation by monte carlo methods . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation methodology was adapted from @xcite ( where more details are given ) and is briefly as follows . </S>",
    "<S> we start the simulation with @xmath100 molecules located at the north pole of a sphere with all molecular dipoles aligned parallel to the spherical surface ( perpendicular to the position vectors ) . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath101 represent the dipoles at zero time , oriented along the laboratory x - axis which is perpendicular to the position vector @xmath102 along the laboratory z - axis . </S>",
    "<S> these molecules are then subjected to random `` kicks '' and allowed to diffuse over the sphere independent of each other . </S>",
    "<S> the diffusion of the dipoles on the spherical surface is effected by rotation of the position vector @xmath103 and the dipole vector @xmath104 by the same three dimensional rotation matrix about a randomly chosen vector @xmath105 normal to the radial position vector @xmath103 . in the simulation , the diffusion constant @xmath106 is chosen to be @xmath107 per time step and the angle of rotation per time step ( one iteration ) is obtained from the corresponding probability equation for planar diffusion , which is valid for very small diffusion lengths . </S>",
    "<S> the orientation of the molecule @xmath104 during diffusion is used as an index of the solid angle swept out by the brownian path . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically evaluate this for each molecule applying the geodesic rule . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath108 and @xmath109 represent the dipole and the radial vectors at time @xmath1 . to determine the orientation of @xmath110 , @xmath108 </S>",
    "<S> is transformed to @xmath111 using a three dimensional rotation matrix with an angle of rotation ( less than @xmath112 ) determined by @xmath113 . </S>",
    "<S> the angle between @xmath111 and @xmath114 is the solid angle enclosed by the brownian path of the diffusing molecule at time @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the solid angles are calculated for all the @xmath100 dipoles at different times . </S>",
    "<S> these are sorted into 360 different bins , each corresponding to one degree increment between @xmath98 and @xmath115 and are plotted in figure 2 .    since the orientation of the molecule is only determined modulo @xmath115 in the simulation , @xmath2 is only measured modulo @xmath115 and not modulo @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> so in effect the function computed by the simulation is @xmath116 . from ( [ finalexp ] ) </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the half integer values of @xmath62 cancel out and the integer values are doubled . </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical expression for @xmath117 is therefore @xmath118 where @xmath62 now increases in _ integer _ steps . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the numerical simulation and the function @xmath117 ( with suitable cutoffs on @xmath62 and @xmath119 ) given above are plotted in figure 2 for different values of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between the simulations and the theory is excellent and the fractional deviation is of order @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the number of molecules in a bin .    in computing the distribution of solid angles , we have chosen all the molecules to be initially at the north pole ( @xmath122 ) and integrated over the final point @xmath58 with a uniform weight , to match with the procedure followed in our simulation . in an experimental situation , where the diffusing particles are excited and observed with external probes </S>",
    "<S> , it may be necessary to consider a weighted average over the initial and final positions of the diffusing particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is easily adapted to take this into account . </S>",
    "<S> one just writes @xmath123 this leads to @xmath124 $ ] , where @xmath125 and the sum is over all eigenstates . in this paper we have set @xmath126 and @xmath127 .    in the problem of diffusion of fluorescent molecules , the tangential component of the orientation of the molecule determines the solid angle enclosed by the diffusing particle only modulo @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because , in parallel transport of a vector , the vector rotates by an angle _ equal _ to the solid angle enclosed by the curve . </S>",
    "<S> as pancharatnam showed @xcite , a quantum two state system transported on the poincar sphere picks up a geometric phase equal to _ half _ the enclosed solid angle . </S>",
    "<S> this measures the solid angle modulo @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution @xmath56 computed in the body of the text describes the distribution of geometric phases . </S>",
    "<S> however , since our simulations were adapted from @xcite , the distribution measured in the simulation is @xmath117 and not @xmath56 .    in @xcite , the generating function for the distribution of solid angles for _ closed _ </S>",
    "<S> brownian paths involved _ only _ the energy eigenvalues of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in the present case of _ open _ brownian paths ( closed by the geodesic rule ) , one needs to use _ both _ the eigenvalues as well as the _ eigenfunctions _ of the hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this is the main difference between @xcite and the present theoretical analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> we have computed the distribution of solid angles for brownian motion on the sphere . </S>",
    "<S> this calculation has also been checked against computer experiments . in simple geometries like the surface of a sphere , </S>",
    "<S> an analytical treatment is possible . in more complicated situations , </S>",
    "<S> one is forced to rely on computer simulations . </S>",
    "<S> monte carlo simulations can be used in two distinct roles . in the present problem , where an analytical treatment is possible </S>",
    "<S> , simulations can be viewed as a computer experiment against which the theory can be tested . </S>",
    "<S> such experiments are much easier to control than real experiments . in cases where an analytical treatment is not possible , </S>",
    "<S> the simulations serve as a substitute for the theory , to be checked against real experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between theory and computer experiments for brownian motion on the sphere also serves as a check on the computer simulations so that these simulations can be confidently used in geometries which can not be treated analytically .    </S>",
