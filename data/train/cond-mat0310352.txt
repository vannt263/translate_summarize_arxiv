    "among the many and varied proposals for constructing quantum computers , spintronic solid state devices occupy a special place because of the prospects of integration with the existing semiconductor technological infrastructure @xcite . at the same time",
    ", superconducting devices have taken an early lead in demonstrating the viability of the building blocks of quantum computing ( qc ) in the solid state , with recent reports of controlled single - qubit operations and entanglement generation @xcite .    in both the spintronics qc proposals , such as quantum dots loss:98,burkard:99,levy:01a - hu:01a , friesen:02 , donor spins in si kane:98-vrijen:00-mozyrsky:01 , electrons on helium @xcite , and the superconducting qc proposals @xcite",
    ", the ability to apply highly localized and inhomogeneous magnetic fields would be a definite advantage , if it could be done without excessive technical difficulties .",
    "in fact the early proposals suggested manipulating individual spin qubits using such localized magnetic fields , e.g. , by a scanning - probe tip or by coupling to an auxiliary ferromagnetic dot loss:98 , but there are significant speed , controllability and other difficulties associated with such methods .",
    "because of these difficulties , in particular the spintronics requirement to resolve single spins , many alternatives to the use of localized magnetic fields have been proposed in spin - based qc .",
    "these alternatives typically avoid the use of magnetic fields altogether : e.g. , @xmath4-factor engineering combined with all electrical control @xcite , optical spin manipulation @xcite , or encoding into the states of several spins bacon:99a - kempe:00-divincenzo:00a , lidarwu:01 .",
    "other alternatives include gate teleportation , which requires controllable exchange interactions and certain two - spin measurements @xcite , and qubits encoded into antiferromagnetic spin clusters , in which case the magnetic field needs to be controlled only over the length scale of the cluster diameter meier:02 . in the context of superconducting qubits it is also possible to avoid using localized magnetic fields by introducing an appropriate encoding @xcite .    , current is @xmath5 and alternates direction as indicated by arrows .",
    "the resulting magnetic field profile is drawn schematically.,height=188 ]    here we revisit the possibility of applying highly localized magnetic fields .",
    "we show that a scheme inspired by magnetic mirrors for cold neutrons @xcite , and more recently cold atoms opat:92,sidorov:96,johnson:98,lau:99,zabow:99 is capable of generating a magnetic field that decays exponentially fast over a length scale comparable to the spacing between nanofabricated quantum dots , and has strength and switching times that are compatible with qc given available estimates of decoherence times .",
    "our scheme uses arrays of parallel current - carrying wires , that is readily implementable with currently available nanotechnology @xcite , and appears well suited for integration with quantum dot nanofabrication methods , as well as with superconducting flux qubits and spin - cluster qubits , where the length scales are larger .",
    "thus we believe that qc with localized magnetic fields deserves a fresh look .",
    "in order to have a concrete application in mind we shall from now on refer to semiconductor quantum dot spin - qubits loss:98,burkard:99,levy:01a - hu:01a , friesen:02",
    ". however , our results are equally applicable to other qubits that are manipulated by localized magnetic fields , such as superconducting flux qubits vdwal:00-friedman:00-blais:00-makhlin:01 .",
    "the first requirement for single - spin magnetic resolution is a magnetic field profile that decays exponentially fast over length scales comparable with the inter - spin spacing .",
    "we will now show , in close analogy to results from magnetic mirrors , how to produce such an exponentially localized magnetic field .",
    "the basic design is one of an array of parallel current carrying wires , with the current direction alternating from wire to wire : see fig .",
    "[ fig : array ] .",
    "we first consider the idealized case of infinitely long wires . in this case",
    "the field can be calculated analytically ( see also vladimirskii:61,opat:92 ) .",
    "let @xmath6 be the magnetic field in the @xmath7 direction generated by @xmath8 infinitely long wires .",
    "we add magnetic field contributions from each wire , to get the field components from @xmath8 wire pairs :    @xmath9    where @xmath5 is the current through each wire and @xmath10 is the reciprocal array constant .",
    "this sum can be computed analytically in the limit @xmath11 using the residue theorem result    .,height=170 ]    @xmath12    where @xmath13 are the poles of @xmath14 , yielding @xmath15the @xmath16-component result shows the basic point : an exponentially localized magnetic field can be generated using a wire array .",
    "the flat top of the @xmath17 profile is a useful design feature , since it implies no exponential sensitivity in the range @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the field magnitude @xmath19 ^{-1/2}\\ ] ] oscillates with period @xmath20 in the @xmath21-direction : see fig .",
    "[ fig : bz ] .",
    "for the purposes of qc , we should ideally be able to address each spin separately . to this end",
    "we propose to center a separate wire array on each quantum dot .",
    "then , as long as the dots are spaced on the order of the lattice constant @xmath20 , we have exponentially sensitive addressability of each dot .",
    "the introduction of multiple arrays is useful in another respect : we can adjust the magnitudes and directions of currents in different arrays so as to exactly cancel the field at all ( or only some ) other dots except the desired one ( or ones ) . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath22 .",
    "the field at position @xmath16 from @xmath23 arrays of wires , with the @xmath24th array having current @xmath25 and intersecting the @xmath16-axis at position @xmath26 ( typically the center of one of the dots ) , is : @xmath27suppose we wish the field to have magnitude @xmath28 at position @xmath26 .",
    "formally , we need to solve : @xmath29.\\]]this is a linear system of @xmath23 equations in the @xmath23 unknowns @xmath25 , so it can always be solved in terms of the @xmath23 positions @xmath26 .",
    "e.g. , the fields with and without the correction are shown , for @xmath30 , in fig .",
    "fig : cancelb .",
    "( solid ) , _ vs _ the field generated by @xmath30 such arrays ( dashed ) , with currents chosen to cancel the field at positions @xmath31.,height=139 ]",
    "for a finite system ( @xmath32 wires , finite length and thickness , non - ideal shape , etc . )",
    ", we can only expect the above results to hold to an approximation .",
    "much of the theory of corrections to finite size effects has already been worked out in @xcite , in the context of atomic mirrors . since for atomic mirrors",
    "the primary concern is specular reflection , there the focus was on reducing the variation of the field magnitude in the planes parallel to the wire arrays . for us",
    "this criterion is unimportant ; instead , our focus is on making the field as localized as possible along the @xmath16-axis .",
    "the first important conclusion in the case of a finite number of wires @xmath8 is that there is a transition from exponential to quadratic ( i. e. , @xmath33 ) decay .",
    "@xcite the transition takes place at the inflection point ( zero second derivative ) of @xmath34 ; however , this is difficult to obtain analytically . to roughly estimate the transition point we compute where the field from a single pair of wires , positioned at the edge of an array of @xmath8 wires ( @xmath35 ) , generates a field of magnitude equal to that from an infinite array : @xmath36 since the transition happens for @xmath37 we neglect @xmath38 in the denominator .",
    "the solution is then @xmath39 numerical calculations show that eq .",
    "( [ eq : zt ] ) overestimates the position of the transition point by about a factor of @xmath3 ; however , after this correction is made , analytics and numerics agree well across several orders of magnitude of @xmath8",
    ".    this logarithmic dependence might appear to pose a severe scalability constraint on our method .",
    "however , this is not the case when we take into account the threshold for fault tolerant quantum error correction steane:02 . for",
    ", it follows from the threshold result that we only need to make the ratio of the peak field ( applied to the desired spin ) to the residual field smaller than , say @xmath40 .",
    "the crucial question thus becomes for what @xmath8 this can be achieved , and this brings us to the idea of endcaps .    as observed in @xcite , near the center of the array",
    "the magnetic field that would be produced by the semi - infinite array of `` missing '' wires is the same ( to first order in @xmath41 ) as that of a pair of wires carrying current @xmath42 and placed with their centers shifted by @xmath43 from the outermost wires in the array .",
    "thus , to cancel this field , one can simply place two `` endcap '' wires carrying currents @xmath44 at these positions . in the context of atomic mirrors",
    "this is important to improve flatness , and hence specular reflection . in zabow:99",
    "it was observed that flatness can be further enhanced by using an _ odd _ number of wires .",
    "some of these schemes can be used to improve _ field localization _",
    ", a criterion not considered orginally .",
    "for instance , we find that the number of wires can be reduced drastically  from @xmath45 to as few as @xmath46 wires  when endcaps are used to achieve a residual field smaller than @xmath47 . by contrast , using an odd @xmath8 is disastrous for localization : for example , residual fields appear at the @xmath48 level for @xmath49 , even including endcap correction . higher ( even ) wire number increases the robustness of the cancellation against experimental uncertainty in the current and position of the endcaps :",
    "@xmath50 is required to maintain @xmath51 for a fractional current variation of @xmath52 and a positional uncertainty of @xmath53 nm , as shown in fig .",
    "fig : optimized .",
    "finally , we note that the corrections arising from the finite length of the wires and the short , perpendicular connecting wires , can also be compensated for by the use of judiciously placed compensating wires @xcite .",
    "of the field of a finite array ( solid lines ) from the field @xmath54 of an infinite array ( grey dashed line , shown for comparison ) .",
    "this array has @xmath50 wires ( including two endcap wires ) , such that main wires are at @xmath55 , and endcap wires are at @xmath56 , carrying current @xmath42 .",
    "field deviations are plotted for a range of endcap currents ( @xmath57 ) and positions ( @xmath58 nm ) .",
    "note that the residual field never exceeds the threshold of @xmath40.,height=170 ]    we now come to estimates of whether the fields and size scales required are feasible in practice .",
    "let us first calculate the magnetic field strength required for single - qubit operations .",
    "a spin can be rotated by a relative angle @xmath59 by turning on the field @xmath60 for a time @xmath61 ( where @xmath62 is the @xmath4-factor , and @xmath63 is the bohr magneton ) .",
    "recent estimates of dephasing times are @xmath64 for electron spins in gaas quantum dots ( a calculation , assuming spectral diffusion is dominant ) @xcite , and a measurement of @xmath65ms for @xmath66 of phosphorus donors in si @xcite .",
    "if we use the more pessimistic of these numbers , and assume a fault tolerance threshold of @xmath40 for qc @xcite , we may estimate the desired operation time as @xmath67s @xmath68ns for an angle @xmath69 .",
    "thus the desired field strength is @xmath70mt .",
    "to evaluate the feasibility of such a specification , we consider an array with periodicity @xmath71 nm , wire radius @xmath72 nm , @xmath73 wires , and length @xmath74 m along the @xmath75-direction .",
    "these dimensions are compatible with the @xmath2 nm length scales of quantum dots @xcite . in order to reach the desired field strength of @xmath76mt , @xmath77ma",
    "would be required .",
    "however , decoherence due to heating with such a current could be a major issue .",
    "an upper bound estimate for the required temperature @xmath78 can be given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the zeeman splitting of the spins in the applied magnetic field @xmath60 .",
    "in our case , we have constrained @xmath60 by the gate time @xmath61 , so we can write @xmath81 , or @xmath82mk for @xmath83ns .",
    "this is feasible with dilution refrigeration technology if the heat load is on the order of @xmath2pw @xcite , comparable to the dissipation of quantum dots @xcite .    for normal metal wires , such a heat load restriction is prohibitive .",
    "the power @xmath84 dissipated is @xmath85 where @xmath24 is the current density , @xmath86 is the total wire length , and @xmath87 is the resistivity .",
    "below @xmath88k , oxygen - free copper can have @xmath89@xmath90 m .",
    "@xcite at @xmath91pw , @xmath92a , which would give @xmath93s  nearly a thousand times slower than our original goal .",
    "although this would be acceptably fast if the decoherence time were @xmath65ms , as in @xcite , the high - purity @xmath87 we have used is optimistic for nanofabricated wires , and the heat generated would increase linearly with the number of qubits manipulated .",
    "one can circumvent resistive heating by using superconductors .",
    "a wire with radius @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the coherence length , can also avoid heating mechanisms associated with vortex movement through the superconductor . for @xmath96 or smaller , where @xmath97 is the penetration depth , the critical current density is due to depairing : @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "these constraints are compatible when @xmath99 , i.e. , mostly type i superconductors . for nb , @xmath100 t , @xmath101 nm , and @xmath102 nm @xcite , so @xmath103a / m@xmath104 .",
    "note that high - temperature superconductors typically have higher @xmath97 and thus lower @xmath105 . in any case",
    ", the critical current density of nb is more than is required : a gate time of @xmath106ns would require @xmath107 .",
    "in conclusion , our results indicate that qc with localized magnetic fields deserves renewed consideration .",
    "we have shown that a method to produce exponentially decaying magnetic fields using an array of current - carrying wires , known in the cold neutron and atom optics communities , is adaptable to solid state quantum computer implementations .",
    "our estimates indicate that in all respects the method is technologically feasible , provided superconducting wires with sufficiently high critical current density ( such as nb ) are used .",
    "our work is motivated by the quest to perform single - spin or flux - qubit rotations , which is a component of a universal set of quantum logic gates . the geometry shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : array ] yields a field that is localized in the @xmath16-direction ; in order to perform arbitrary single - qubit rotations we need to localize the field along another , perpendicular direction . an independent field vector can be produced by a second set of interleaved arrays placed at 45@xmath108 with respect to the original arrays , with current flowing along @xmath109 . with a judicious array placement and @xmath110 , for qubit spacing @xmath111 and any integer @xmath112 , the field direction will be along @xmath113 at all qubits ( this design will need to be optimized similarly to our considerations above  an issue we do not intend to address here ) .",
    "the additional spatial constraints would require only a four - fold increase in @xmath20 for the same currents and wire sizes .",
    "if on the other hand , introducing a second array is undesirable , software  solutions using recoupling and encoding techniques have been developed to still allow for universal qc lidarwu:01 .",
    "these techniques would be considerably simplified by the ability to perform single - qubit operations along one direction .    _",
