    "bismuth - substituted ferrite garnets ( bi : fgs ) are well known to have a giant magnetooptical response@xcite . for this reason ,",
    "they have found widespread use as spatial light modulators , optical switchers and optical isolators .",
    "recently it was realized that bi : fg films with in - plane magnetization allow visualization and detection of magnetic fields@xcite . as basic sensors for magnetooptic imaging",
    "they have been used extensively in studies of magnetic flux in superconductors , domain formation in magnetic materials , currents in microelectronic circuits and recorded patterns in magnetic storage media@xcite . in spite of their successful applications ,",
    "relatively few studies have been directed towards the understanding of the magnetooptical properties of bi : fg films themselves .",
    "of particular interest here is the behaviour and optimization of the faraday rotation spectra .",
    "the dodecahedral sites in garnet crystals can accept several rare - earth ions , and each substitution seems to introduce its own special modification in the properties .",
    "all of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 have been shown to increase the faraday rotation within certain wavelength intervals@xcite . with @xmath0 a very strong faraday rotation",
    "is obtained in the visible range , which together with the fact that the grown crystals are nearly transparent , make them by far the most frequently used material for magnetooptic imaging . for this application",
    "an important point is also that the films with in - plane magnetization are essentially free of magnetic domains .",
    "the understanding of the magnetooptical spectra in garnets is based on the knowledge of the spin orbit interaction in these materials .",
    "the spin orbit interaction generally causes a splitting of both the ground and excited states . however , in many cases it is possible to assume splitting of one of the states .",
    "then only two situations are possible , ( i ) a paramagnetic transition , which is due to a orbital degenerate ground state with a singlet excited state .",
    "( ii ) a diamagnetic transition , which is due to a orbital singlet ground state with a spin orbit split excited state . since the paramagnetic and diamagnetic transitions have quite different lineshapes@xcite , it should in principle be possible to distinguish between isolated diamagnetic and paramagnetic transitions , and therefore obtain a correct interpretation of the spectra .",
    "however , bi : fg materials have several transitions within the uv and visible region , which complicates the interpretation considerably .",
    "this has lead to some controversy regarding the kind of transitions involved , and therefore how to reproduce the spectra theoretically@xcite .",
    "simsa @xmath3 @xmath4 measured the faraday rotation of liquid phase epitaxy ( lpe ) grown bi : fg films with small substitutions of bismuth@xcite . to interprete the spectra",
    ", they introduced one diamagnetic and several paramagnetic transitions . in this way they were able to correctly predict the behaviour of the spectra in the visible and near - infrared region .",
    "however , there were still some deviations between experimental and theoretical data when the bismuth substitution increased .",
    "more recently , matsumoto @xmath3 @xmath4 measured the faraday rotation for bi : fg films made by the gel method@xcite . here",
    "reasonable agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions was obtained with four paramagnetic transitions in addition to the four diamagnetic ones .",
    "however , the inclusion of paramagnetic transitions was not explained .",
    "actually , dionne and allen questioned whether paramagnetic transitions can account for the contribution from bi , since the strong superexchange field of the spin degeneracy exclude zeeman splitting of the ground state , thus leaving a spin singlet ground state@xcite .",
    "in this paper we report experiments and modelling of the faraday rotation spectra in bi : fg films suitable for magnetooptic imaging . to that end",
    "we have grown a series of bi : fg films using the lpe technique , and characterised their chemical composition .",
    "the faraday rotation spectra have been measured for photon energies between @xmath5 and @xmath6 ev , corresponding to wavelengths between @xmath7 and @xmath8 nm .",
    "it is shown that the faraday rotation changes significantly with the amount of substituted gallium and bismuth .",
    "furthermore , the comparison of experimental and theoretical data confirms that the magnetooptic response changes linearly with the bismuth substitution .",
    "single crystal films of bi : fg were grown by isothermal lpe from @xmath9 flux onto ( 100 ) oriented gadolinium gallium garnet ( ggg ) substrates .",
    "the growth takes place while the 30 mm diameter substrate is dipped into the melt contained in a pt crucible . during the growth",
    ", the parameters could be controlled to create low magnetic coercivity and in - plane magnetization in the garnet films .",
    "the thickness of the films was measured using a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) , and their composition determined with an electron microprobe ( emp ) .",
    "thicknesses and compositions of four selected samples are listed in table 1 . for sample 1 , 2 and 4",
    "the film was grown on only one side of the substrate , whereas sample 3 has a 2 @xmath10 thick film on both sides of the substrate .    from table 1",
    "one sees that the films can be represented by the following general formula ; @xmath11(fe_{3-u_{d}}ga_{u_{d}})o_{12}$ ] , where @xmath12 indicates the dodecahedral site , [ ] the octahedral site , and ( ) the tetrahedral site .",
    "note that only the total gallium content @xmath13 can be extracted from the emp , and to determine @xmath14 and @xmath15 separately other techniques such as neutron spectroscopy must be applied .",
    "usually , these techniques require bulk samples , and are not very useful for thin films .",
    "the films also contain small amounts of @xmath16 , typically of the order of @xmath17 . in the theoretical analysis of the faraday spectra",
    ", we will neglect the contribution from pb .",
    "the faraday rotation as a function of wavelength at room temperature was measured using a setup consisting of a monochromatic light source , polarizer , two magnetic helmholtz coils , sample , analyzer and detector .",
    "a schematic drawing is shown in fig .",
    "the helmholtz coils produce a magnetic field up to 1.1 koe along the optical axis , which makes it possible to saturate the faraday rotation of the sample . in this work",
    "all the samples were brought into saturation during the measurements .",
    "the faraday rotation angle was measured as@xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the faraday rotation measured for the combined film and substrate , @xmath20 is the faraday rotation of the bare substrate and @xmath21 is the thickness of the film .",
    "the substrates used in this study are 0.5 mm thick , and give only a small contribution of @xmath22 degrees . in the present study we found that interference effects due to finite thickness as well as the faraday ellipticity could be neglected .",
    "the faraday rotation has been measured across the useful visible wavelength range with an accuracy of @xmath23 degrees .",
    "the wavelength was determined within @xmath24 nm .    shown in figs .",
    "2 - 4 is the observed faraday rotation as a function of energy for samples 1 - 4 . here",
    "@xmath25 is denoted by negative numbers since we follow the sign - convention of refs.@xcite .",
    "one sees that for sample 1 - 3 , the magnitude of @xmath25 increases monotonically with the photon energy .",
    "the largest rotation was found in sample 3 at 2.43 ev where @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "since sample 4 is relatively thin , we were able to measure the spectrum up to 2.53 ev without reducing the accuracy of the measurement .",
    "this revealed a peak in the spectrum near 2.45 ev , where @xmath28 @xmath27 .",
    "our analysis of the faraday rotation spectra is based on the molecular - orbital energy - level diagram of dionne and allen@xcite , shown in fig .",
    "the basic mechanism behind the enhanced faraday rotation is here the cooperative action of @xmath29 ions with degenerate orbital terms that are split further by covalent interaction with @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , substitution of bismuth results in an overlap between the 6p orbit of @xmath0 , 2p orbit of @xmath30 and 3d orbit of @xmath29 . as discussed by shinagawa@xcite , and later by dionne and allen@xcite , this overlap results in an spin orbit splitting @xmath31 associated with the tetrahedral and octahedral sites , see also fig .",
    "[ f5 ] . in the model presented here",
    "we ignore the contribution from transitions other than those introduced by bismuth substitution .",
    "in fact , luig and yig have very similar faraday rotation spectra with a positive peak located near 2.8 ev , but with very low faraday rotation below 2.6 ev@xcite .",
    "this makes our assumption reasonable .    in order to calculate the magnetooptic response , an expression which links the microscopic parameters to the faraday rotation",
    "is needed . in magnetooptics ,",
    "this is usually expressed through the complex permittivity tensor , which for bi : fg has the form , @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the magnetooptical response and @xmath34 the non - magnetooptical part . in the visible region ,",
    "the faraday rotation can be written@xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the the frequency , or equivalently the energy of the light , c is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath37 is the refractive index .",
    "independent measurements show that it is reasonable to set @xmath38 in the visible range@xcite .    assuming that the transitions are of electric dipole nature , the off - diagonal elements derived from first order time - dependent perturbation theory are given by@xcite , @xmath39 the inner sum is over the right- and left - hand circular polarized light , whereas the outer is over the optical transitions in the tetrahedral and octahedral sublattices .",
    "the prefactor @xmath40 denotes a substraction .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath42 represent the resonance energy for right and left - hand circular polarized light , respectively . similarly , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the respective oscillator strengths , while @xmath45 is the half - linewidth of the transition . furthermore , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the electron charge and mass , respectively , whereas @xmath48 is the active ion density .    to first order , it is reasonable to assume that @xmath48 is directly proportional to the bismuth content @xmath49@xcite .",
    "this assumption has also been confirmed by experiments@xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is known that the strong enhancement of faraday rotation is caused by iron - pair transitions , involving both octahedral and tetrahedral transitions simultaneously@xcite . therefore , iron dilution of either sublattice results in a reduction of the active ion density . for these reasons",
    "we propose that the active ion density can be written as , @xmath50 @xmath51 is a constant , and may expected to be 1/3 of the density of rare - earth ions on the dodecahedral site , i.e. @xmath52 @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath54 , this interpretation implies that the dodecahedral site is fully occupied by bismuth .",
    "the oscillator strength for right- and left - hand circular polarized light are given by@xcite , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is planck s constant , @xmath57 is the electric dipole operator , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 being the wavefunction of the ground state and excited state , respectively . using that for the present case one has @xmath60 , we obtain from eq . ( [ a33 ] ) , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is an effective oscillator strength@xcite .",
    "this expression is based on neglecting the difference between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    in order to fully predict the faraday spectra",
    ", one needs detailed knowledge about the quantum mechanical oscillator strengths .",
    "however , this is not easily accessible with so many ions involved , and we will instead treat them as adjustable parameters in the comparison with experimental data . with eq .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) inserted in eqs .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath65^{2 } + 4\\omega^{2}\\gamma_{i}^{2 } } - \\frac{(\\omega_{i}-\\delta_{i})^{2}-\\omega^{2}-\\gamma_{i}^{2}}{\\left[(\\omega_{i}-\\delta_{i})^{2}-\\omega^{2}+\\gamma_{i}^{2}\\right]^{2 } + 4\\omega^{2}\\gamma_{i}^{2 } } \\right\\ } \\,\\,\\ ,   , \\label{a4 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which represents our model for the faraday rotation .",
    "to fit theoretical curves to the experimental data , the product @xmath66 was chosen as free parameter .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ a21 ] ) @xmath48 depends on the gallium and bismuth content . on the other hand , @xmath62 is roughly independent on these two substitutions .",
    "therefore , the product @xmath66 may be adjusted to any substitutions and transitions .",
    "the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath45 were chosen as sample independent , and the values suggested by dionne and allen were used as a starting point in the fitting@xcite .",
    "table 2 presents the parameters we found to give the best fit between the theoretical curves and the experimental data .",
    "note that our values for @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 differs slightly from those of dionne and allen .",
    "a reason for this is that the minimum faraday rotation seems to be shifted slightly towards lower energies as compared to the data analysed in ref.@xcite",
    ". furthermore our values for @xmath70 and @xmath71 are smaller to account for the narrow linewidth near 2.45 ev seen in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] and [ f3 ] the faraday rotation calculated from eq .",
    "( [ a4 ] ) is plotted as solid lines , and show an excellent agreement with experimental data . in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] the dashed and dash - dotted lines represent the contribution to the total faraday rotation from the tetrahedral and octahedral sites , respectively .",
    "note that below 2.2 ev , the main contribution to @xmath72 comes from the transition related to the octahedral site .",
    "[ f4 ] shows the theoretical curve ( solid line ) fitted to the experimental data for sample 4 .",
    "again there is excellent agreement at small photon energies , but some deviation appears above 2.4 ev , where both the experimental and theoretical curves show a peaked behaviour .",
    "in fact the experimental data indicate a stronger peak than the theoretical prediction . there may be several reasons for such a discrepancy .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ a21 ] ) represents a simplification for the present type of fgs .",
    "in particular , we have not considered the canting of the spins or the temperature dependence of @xmath48 .",
    "there is also a possibillity that @xmath67 and @xmath45 should be chosen differently to obtain a stronger peak around 2.45 ev .",
    "finally , it must be noted that we have neglected the transitions associated with pure luig .",
    "we have in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] also plotted theoretical predictions for the case @xmath73 ( dashed curve ) and @xmath74 ( dash - dotted curve ) assuming that gallium content is identical to that of sample 4 .",
    "when @xmath74 it seems possible to obtain a faraday rotation exceeding 6 @xmath27 at 2.3 ev in this material .",
    "the distribution of gallium on the tetrahedral and octahedral sites have been examined by czerlinsky and scott @xmath3 @xmath4 for various garnet - compositions with and without bismuth@xcite .",
    "their results indicated that gallium will replace @xmath29 in both tetrahedral and octahedral sublattices , but with the strongest dilution of tetrahedrally coordinated @xmath29 .",
    "in fact , czerlinsky found that for @xmath75 the distribution is 0.9 ga on tetrahedral sites and only 0.1 on octahedral sites .",
    "although the samples investigated in this study have somewhat different composition , we will assume that the gallium distribution is the same .",
    "then , based on eq .",
    "( [ a21 ] ) the gallium dependence can be removed resulting in a faraday rotation associated only with the bi - content given by , @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] the @xmath79 is displayed as a function of the bismuth substitution .",
    "the experimental data have the same notation as in the previous figures , and are shown for two different energies , 1.97 ev ( 630 nm ) and 2.3 ev ( 540 nm ) , corresponding also to the theoretical curves drawn as solid and dashed lines , respectively . to obtain the theoretical curves we used @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xmath81 , which are the average values of the four samples as calculated from table 2 and the assumed gallium distribution .",
    "the experimental points are located very close to the straight lines , thus indicating that our linear approximation is valid .",
    "however , the linear approximation may not hold for large x , since saturation phenomena could change the behaviour .",
    "in fact , experimental studies by matsumoto @xmath3 @xmath4 indicated breakdown of the linear approximation when @xmath83@xcite .",
    "we have synthesized single crystals of bismuth - substituted ferrite garnets by the liquid phase epitaxy method where ggg substrates are dipped into the flux .",
