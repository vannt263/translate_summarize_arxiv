    "the usual treatment involves deriving a set of coupled quantum transport equations ( qte ) involving cp conserving relaxation terms and cp violating sources derived from scattering amplitudes evaluated using the ctp formalism @xcite@xcite .",
    "there are in general as many qtes as there are particle species in your model so one may be left with a daunting number of coupled inhomogeneous differential equations to solve .",
    "therefore one usually proceeds either by solving the system numerically or by using a set of approximations to reduce the number of qtes to a single one which is then solved in two regions with the solutions matched at the phase boundary .",
    "the former method is very cumbersome and the latter method involves using a set of fast rate approximations to reduce the set of coupled transport equations down to one ( e.g. @xcite and the references therein for this treatment in the mssm ) .",
    "however , recently it has been shown that in the case of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with @xmath2 parity conservation , the assumption of fast yukawa and triscalar rates is infrequently justified @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the practice of solving the equations in two regions effectively approximates the vev profile with a step function and ignores any effects of a thick bubble wall , an assumption we refer to in this paper as the `` ultra thin wall approximation '' . in this work",
    "we show how to analytically go beyond these approximations by deriving an exact solution to a general set of qtes .",
    "we begin by considering the set of qtes that govern the mssm during an electroweak phase transition derived under the assumption of local supergauge equilibrium and null number densities for weak bosons .",
    "this is admittedly not an exact system to begin with but it is useful as an example before we generalizing our method to larger systems of coupled transport equations with multiple cp violating source terms . we also show how to analytically derive an expansion that goes beyond the ultra thin wall approximation .",
    "moreover , we show that once one knows the form of the solution - which has a general form - one can more quickly derive the solution using a parametrized ansatz whose parameters are determined by direct substitution .",

    "we review the closed time path formalism and its use in deriving a set of coupled qtes that govern the behaviour of particle densities across a phase transition . in section [ mssm ]",

    "we show how to re derive this solution quickly using a parametrized ansatz .",

    "we also require the number densities to vanish at @xmath90 .",
    "all exponents therefore have to be positive definite in the symmetric phase .",
    "therefore @xmath91 to ensure number densities go to zero in the broken phase we have a condition on all positive definite exponents @xmath92 finally our continuity conditions need to be met .",
    "the continuity conditions are not met by requiring @xmath69 and its derivatives to be continuous at the phase boundary even though this will give the right number of conditions .",
    "instead we require that @xmath93 and @xmath94 are continuous at @xmath95 . as an example consider the case when the last three @xmath78 exponents are greater than @xmath96 as well as the first three @xmath97 exponents .",

    "the above derivation was cumbersome even for the simple example we used and yet the solution was relatively simple .",
    "now that we know the form of the solution , it is far more efficient to start with this form of the solution as a parametrized ansatz and use the differential equations to work out the parameters of the ansatz .",

    "finally solve the inhomogeneous equation @xmath112    the inhomogeneous solution is then trivially found to be @xmath113 in the broken phase and @xmath114 in the symmetric phase as before .",

    "remarkably , the above method of solving the set of differential equations analytically is at least as fast as using an approximation that assumes the strong sphaleron and yukawa rates are fast in order to reduce our set of transport equations to a single differential equation which one then solves .",
    "in this section we discuss how far generalizations of the above procedure can go .",
    "the generalization of our procedure is trivial to any case where you have only one cp violating source and you can manipulate the transport equations into the cascading form @xmath126 & = & 0 \\nonumber \\\\ d_2[x_1,x_2,x_3 ] & = & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & & \\nonumber \\\\ d_{n-1}[x_1,x_2,x_3 \\cdots x_n ] & = & 0 \\nonumber \\\\ d_{n-1}[x_1,x_2,x_3 \\cdots x_n ] & = & \\delta ( z ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can just use the parametrized ansatz approach defined in the previous section to very quickly derive the solution . much more daunting are the cases where one either has multiple cp violating sources or one can not manipulate the transport equations into the above form . fortunately in this section we will show that in principle an analytical solution can always be found even in the presence of such complications and the parametrized ansatz approach generally reduces the difficulty of problems greatly .      in the mssm",
    "there are several @xmath16 violating sources . handling the extra cp violating",
    "sources however was done by simply noting that they are all proportional to @xmath127 .",
    "this situation becomes far more non trivial in the case where there are numerous cp violating source terms proportional to different functions of @xmath46 .",
    "for example the nmssm has source terms that are a function of the singlet s vev profile , @xmath128 as well as the higgs profiles @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "consider the set of transport equations from the previous section with an extra @xmath16 violating term @xmath131",
    "if we solve the first transport equation as before the second equation becomes @xmath132 the solution to this equation is of course @xmath133 with @xmath134 for reasons given in the appendix .",

    "so in principle one can use the parametrized ansatz approach to simplify the problem here as well so long as one is careful in deriving what to replace @xmath115 with .",
    "the equation structures that we encountered in the mssm were not the only possible structures that could arise . in this brief subsection",
    "we would like to briefly consider other possible equation structures .",
    "consider an equation where the linear terms are missing @xmath139 the procedure is subtly different to before .",
    "the first step is the same as before where we solve for @xmath140 by treating the derivatives of @xmath141 as inhomogeneous source @xmath142 just as before we aim to remove the exponentials and the integral using a series of changes of variables .",
    "this time though our variables changes are @xmath143 which leaves us with a very similar form for the solution ( after a suitable rescaling ) @xmath144 another important extension is to consider the case where we can not reduce the first equation to a differential equation involving only two number densities . in the simplest case",
    "our first equation is a differential operator acting on three number densities @xmath145 in which case we can reduce this to an equation involving only two number density by defining auxillary functions @xmath146 and @xmath147 as follows @xmath148 if @xmath149 and @xmath150 otherwise .",
    "one can then choose @xmath151 such that they cancel the terms @xmath152 in the above transport equation .",
    "we therefore have two techniques to convert a set of transport equations to cascading form - taking linear combinations of equations and using the method immediately described above .",
    "consider the case where we have @xmath153 transport equations and a single cp violating source .",
    "in general there are @xmath154 conditions to satisfy to reorganize the equations into a cascading form .",
    "the most general extension of the use of auxillary functions is to define the following @xmath155 this gives us a total of @xmath156 parameters to use .",
    "we can also take linear combinations of the @xmath157 transport equations that do not contain the cp violating source to meet another @xmath158 conditions .",
    "unfortunately this brings us short of the required @xmath154 conditions . in reality",
    "this analysis is probably unrealistically pessimistic for two reasons .",
    "first , while the initial set of transport equations indeed can have all @xmath153 fields appearing in the relaxation terms of all equations , there are only two derivative terms initially in each transport equation .",
    "thus it may be possible to make careful manipulations that evade the arguments given above .",
    "secondly , the equations tend to have a lot more structure than our naive analysis let on .",
    "for example a number of equations might have the same relaxation term on the right hand side so the combination of two transport equations with this term might remove many coefficients , @xmath159 , for the price of one .",
    "nevertheless it is usefull to consider an unrealistically pessimistic scenario where all conditions need to be met .",
    "the lowest number of densities that are not guaranteed a path that converts our qtes into a cascading form in this overly pessimistic scenario is @xmath160 .",
    "we then have the transport equations @xmath161 with @xmath162 and @xmath63 .",
    "we will now sketch out how a solution can be derived .",
    "let us define @xmath163 in such a way as to remove @xmath164 from the first equation . throughout this argument",
    "the subscript on @xmath165 will denote the number of times a variable has been changed and the superscript will denote the original field that was replaced . repeating this process to remove @xmath166 and",
    "then the resulting @xmath167 allows us to write the first equation in terms of two linear combinations of number densities which can be denoted @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "we can then solve this equation to write both in terms of the variable @xmath63 following the same steps as out lined in previous sections .",
    "the second through to fifth equations now involve four variables only .",
    "one can again use the same trick to eliminate one number density from the second equation leaving us with something in the form -and we are only interested in a general form as we will use a parametrized ansatz approach shortly - @xmath170 one can then define the following changes in variables @xmath171 to cancel the second equations dependants on @xmath69 ( actually this gives us a couple too many parameters so we can set these to 1 ) .",
    "this equation then can also be solved with the usual techniques to write @xmath172 and @xmath173 in terms of a new variable @xmath69 .",
    "the remaining three equations are a function of @xmath63 , @xmath69 and @xmath172 only .",
    "we can use a similar trick to remove the dependency on @xmath69 in the third equation with the variables @xmath174 the remaining equations are now in cascading form and can be solved using the methods prescribed above .",
    "the derivation of the solution to this overly pessimistic case sketched above is very cumbersome .",
    "however , even in this case the solution is identical to what one would get if one used a parametrized ansatz from the start .",
    "using the parametrized ansatz method we can write down the solutions immediately without setting pen to paper @xmath175 with @xmath97 being the @xmath176 roots to the equation @xmath177 with @xmath178 and @xmath179 which can be rewritten as a matrix equation @xmath180 inverting these equations and rescaling by multiplying through by the denominators gives the very simple structure @xmath181 the analogous functions in the mssm also have this form although using a permutation symbol in that case is probably overkill since there would only be two terms contracted with it and one of those terms is zero two out of three times .",
