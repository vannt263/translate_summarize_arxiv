    "<S> we review the notion of symmetry breaking and restoration within the frame of nuclear energy density functional methods . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on key differences between wave - function- and energy - functional - based methods . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we point to difficulties to formulate the restoration of symmetries within the energy functional framework . the problems tackled recently in connection with particle - number restoration serve as a baseline to the present discussion . </S>",
    "<S> reaching out to angular - momentum restoration , we identify an exact mathematical property of the energy density @xmath0 that could be used to constrain energy density functional kernels . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we suggest possible routes towards a better formulation of symmetry restorations within energy density functional methods . </S>"
