    ", a beam of two - level atoms incident upon a two - slit arrangement can show interference pattern .",
    "before to reach the interference region however each atom , initially in the excited state , passes trough either one of two maser cavities which are both in the vacuum state , and makes a transition to the lower state , so that the emitted microwave photon leaves a which - way information in the cavity .",
    "it turns out that the atom - cavity correlations are responsible for a loss of coherence which destroys the interference fringes . following a previous idea of scully and drhl @xcite (",
    "also related to the delayed - choice experiments suggested by wheeler @xcite ) , they show how it is possible to retrieve the interference effects by removing ( erasing ) the _ welcher weg _ information .",
    "+ the experimental arrangement of the optical stern - gerlach model @xcite can be used for a similar quantum optical test of complementarity .",
    "in fact , the interaction hamiltonian of this model gives rise to entangled states in which the translational variables of the atomic center - of - mass are correlated with the cavity and the internal atomic variables . in this case as well as in the case analyzed in ref.@xcite , the presence or the loss of coherence in the atomic spatial distribution out the cavity ,",
    "can be connected to the peculiar correlations between the measuring apparatus ( the cavity field ) and the system being observed .",
    "diffraction and interference effects induced by field measurements have been analyzed by storey , collett and walls @xcite in the raman - nath regime , for virtual atomic transitions in the presence of very large detuning with respect to the rabi frequency . evoking an old question posed by popper @xcite , namely ,",
    "if knowledge alone is sufficient to give uncertainty , they show that the localization of the atom trough the field measurement may be thought as a creation of a virtual slit ( or slits ) and their conclusion is that knowledge alone is sufficient to create uncertainty . according to this vision , here",
    "we show that the knowledge of the field state erases the which - way information concerning two mutually exclusive quantum paths the system can follow . on the contrary ,",
    "the mere possibility of acquiring this information which is stored in the atom - cavity correlations precludes any interference pattern . + a phase space analysis is carried out in sec .",
    "iv in terms of the the wigner distribution for the atomic translational variables .",
    "this analysis allows us to establish a well defined relation between the determinant of the covariance matrix of the wigner function and the distinguishability of the two quantum paths the .",
    "the interaction of a two - level atom with a resonant mode of an optical cavity is usually described , in the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , by the well known jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 account for the internal atomic dynamics , while @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the annihilation and creation operators for the photons of the resonant mode of the cavity standing wave , and @xmath5 is the coupling constant . in this model",
    "one assumes that the atom travels the cavity along a direction which is orthogonal to the cavity axis , with a velocity sufficiently large to treat classically this translational degree of freedom .",
    "however , even if this condition is satisfied the translation degree of freedom along the cavity axis can not be overlooked .",
    "in fact , this dynamics correlates with the dynamics describing the energy exchange between the two - level atom and the cavity field , giving rise , for example , to the optical stern - gerlach deflection , to the non dissipative damping of the rabi oscillations @xcite , and so on .",
    "let us therefore consider the optical stern - gerlach model @xmath6 where the dynamics along the x - direction of the cavity axis is described by the position observable @xmath7 of the atomic center - of - mass and by its conjugate momentum @xmath8 .",

    "we also assume that , at @xmath12 , the state of the global system is given by a factorized form , @xmath13 where the dressed states @xmath14 are eigenstates of the excitation number operator , @xmath15 .",
    "they are also eigenstates of the interaction energy , @xmath16 with opposite eigenvalues , while @xmath17 describes the atomic translational dynamics .",
    "the kets @xmath18 and @xmath19 denote the atom - cavity states in which the single excitation of the system pertains to the atom or to the cavity , respectively . by using the time evolution operator @xmath20 @xcite",

    ", they also show that interference effects in the atomic spatial distribution can appear in agreement with the record of the photon state in the cavity . + for @xmath36 , while @xmath37 , the spatial branches @xmath38 evolve according to the free hamiltonian , and one has    @xmath39^{2}}{4\\,\\beta(t ) }    \\mp \\frac{i}{\\hbar}m\\,a\\,t\\,x\\right\\}.\\ ] ]    as shown by the eq.s ( [ psit ] ) the state of the system splits up into a coherent superposition of two branches travelling in opposite directions and encoding correlations between the internal and the translational dynamics .",
    "this suggests to associate the two orthogonal eigenstates @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the interaction energy to two mutually exclusive quantum paths , the two paths actually differing the one from the other for the opposite direction of the exchanged momentum between the atom and the cavity mirrors ( eq .",
    "( [ phitrapprp ] ) ) .",
    "+ to clarify this point , let us suppose to perform experiments measuring the atomic momentum out of the cavity . for @xmath42 sufficiently large the probability density of finding a particular momentum @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) will be different from zero , as shown by eq.([phitrapprp ] ) , only inside a range @xmath45 around @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "in fact for @xmath43 @xmath48 and for @xmath44 @xmath49 , while for @xmath50 the probability density is practically zero . in each case",
    "( @xmath43 , @xmath44 ) the measured atomic momentum has been acquired by the atom from the mirrors of the cavity by means of a certain number of photon exchanges with the field . for a random sequence of positive and negative momentum exchanges ,",
    "the output distribution of the atomic momentum would be different from zero in a range @xmath45 around @xmath51 .",
    "the final evolution @xmath52 for the initial state @xmath18 is on the contrary compatible with a model in which , in a single experiment where , as above , the atomic momentum is measured , the atom entering the cavity has first @xmath53% probability of exchanging positive or negative momentum with the mirrors , but after the first choice , the system keeps to exchange momentum in the same direction . for either path the atoms exchange momentum with the mirrors , in such a way as to change their average momentum from @xmath54 to @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "as in the double - slit experiment of young , we may observe interference fringes if there is no way to acquire information on the quantum paths . in our case",
    "this information erasure can be accomplished , for example , by measuring the cavity photon state .",
    "in fact , the states @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , are associated to the atom going through both the quantum paths , with definite relative phase , different for the two states .",
    "+ on the contrary , if the above measurement is not made , from eq.([subeq1 ] ) , using the orthonormality of the dressed states , we get a spatial atomic distribution , both inside and out of the cavity , @xmath56 which does not exhibit interference terms since the correlations between the cavity and the atom cause a loss of coherence which destroys the interference .",
    "one can also say that because of the entanglement , the atom imprints in the cavity information about the followed path , which is encoded in the interaction energy and that could also be read by finding out the direction of the exchanged momentum with the mirrors .",
    "this information serves as a which - way identification and leads , as will be shown later , to a classical - like probability distribution in the phase space . in this case",
    ", it is the mere possibility of recovering the information on the direction side of the exchanged momentum that makes distinction between the two paths .",
    "+ let us now suppose that a measurement of the photon field in the cavity is made which records zero photons in the cavity , or one photon .",
    "the atomic state out of the cavity , after the measurement , will be proportional , respectively , to    [ psimesuret ] @xmath57     + if we repeat the measurement for many atoms entering the cavity in the same conditions , the interference patterns of the atoms correlated to the two different records will consequently be given respectively by    [ pmesuredx ] @xmath58    where @xmath38 are given by the eq .",
    "( [ phixtt ] ) .",
    "+ eq.s ( [ psimesuret ] ) and ( [ pmesuredx ] ) show that the measurement of the photon field in the cavity plays the role of  quantum eraser \" which removes the which way information from the cavity and retrieves the interference terms .",
    "it is worth to observe that for the two different records different interference effects will appear in form of  fringes \" and  antifringes \" patterns . + it is however to point out that the distinguishability of the two quantum paths depends on the momentum distribution as induced by the field interaction . in particular , the measurement of a positive or negative momentum exchange with the cavity could be possible only if the distance between the two main peaks is distinctly larger than the uncertainty @xmath59 , that is @xmath60 .",
    "since in our case we assume @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 and the two paths can be distinguished if @xmath63 .",

    "[ fig2 ] ) . + to analyze the spatial atomic distribution given by the eq.s ( [ pmesuredx ] ) , it is convenient to examine first the interference term    @xmath64=\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\,\\pi}\\delta x_{t}}\\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{(x - x_{0})^{2}}{2\\,\\delta x_{t}^{2}}-\\frac { \\left[a\\,t ( t - t/2 ) \\right]^{2}}{2\\,\\delta x_{t}^{2 } } \\right\\}\\cos\\{2\\,\\varepsilon\\,t\\,k[x-(x - x_{0})\\eta(t , t)]\\}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65    the eq .",
    "( [ 2rephiupphidown ] ) shows that for short flight time out of the cavity ( @xmath66 ) and for used values of the parameters , the interference term is of the same order of the main peaks @xmath67 of the spatial distribution , and fringe patterns can be observed . for increasing free flight time @xmath68 and @xmath69",
    ", the main peaks travel far away the one from the other , while the interference term is damped to zero and the fringe patterns disappear .",
    "in fact for @xmath68 , the exponential factor of eq .",

    "the condition on the momentum space does not depend on @xmath72 and implies @xmath73 if this last condition is satisfied , the damping takes place for @xmath74 and consequently , for the parameters used in fig.s [ fig3 ] , @xmath75 .",
    "the loss of the interference fringes is in these cases only due to the increasing distance between the two paths whose superposition is still coherent . as a consequence ,",
    "as will be shown in the next section , the probability distribution in the phase space contains oscillating terms which show disagreement with a classical like behavior .",
    "+    the spatial atomic distributions ( [ pmesured0x ] ) and ( [ pmesured1x ] ) are visualized in fig.s [ fig2]a , [ fig3]a , [ fig4]a and [ fig2]b , [ fig3]b , [ fig4]b , respectively , as a function of @xmath76 , for different values of @xmath42 .",
    "fig.s [ fig2 ] show that for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the probability of finding the atom in the excited state is enforced by the interference term , while the complementary probability of finding it in the ground state is strongly weakened .",
    "the spatial distributions for @xmath68 do not change sensitively .",
    "+ for @xmath79 and @xmath78 , the interference term gives rise to fringes ( fig.[fig3]a ) and antifringes ( fig.[fig3]b ) patterns which are evident up to @xmath80 , while for much longer times disappear .",
    "+ for @xmath81 , the oscillations in @xmath82 of the interference term occur in closer succession and the resulting patterns are shown in fig.s [ fig4]a and [ fig4]b .",
    "some properties of the atomic spatial distribution and of its correlation to the internal dynamics can be better understood by means of the wigner function @xmath83 @xcite .",

    "+ the classicality of the probability distribution has been here recovered by releasing information on the internal dynamics and could be considered as a natural ending up of the distribution if a decay time of the photon in the cavity would be taken into account , after which , the information on the cavity state is irreversibly lost .",
    "+ the positive definition of the wigner function allows to comment on the generalized uncertainty area @xmath98 ( the error box @xcite ) of the whole spatial distribution in the phase space and to relate it to the distance between the gaussian distributions which describe the different paths . the square uncertainty @xmath99 is evaluated as the determinant of the distribution covariance matrix @xmath100 and for @xmath101 it is given by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the adimensional distance in the phase space between the average positions of the two gaussian centered in @xmath104 and @xmath105 , measured in units of @xmath26 and @xmath59 along @xmath82 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "it is to notice that @xmath107 and then @xmath108 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath90 the atom evolves freely and the uncertainty area ( or the determinant of the covariance matrix ) is constant in time as it happens for particle subjected to a potential at most quadratic .",
    "since @xmath109 is the square of the initial uncertainty area , the enlargement of the square area in time is only due to the distance @xmath110 .",

    "the wigner function after the quantum erasure shows on the contrary the positive - negative oscillations typical of a coherent superposition of two quantum paths .",
