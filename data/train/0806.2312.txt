    "details about the scientific results from numerical qcd simulations can be found in @xcite .",
    "considerable effort was invested this past year in preparation for the exploitation of leadership computing facility at argonne ( anl ) and oak ridge ( ornl ) national laboratories .",
    "we have also carried out investigations into the efficient use of multi core architectures for qcd .",
    "our data sharing efforts have progressed , and we continue to extend and refine standards within our collaboration and worldwide . this article is organized as follows : in section [ s : lcf ] we present some highlights of our exploitation of leadership computing resources .",
    "we report on our threading research in section [ s : threading ] .",
    "we discuss data sharing in section [ s : datasharing ] and briefly consider other activities in section [ s : miscellany ] .",
    "during the last year , all of our large community codes have been successfully ported to leadership systems of interest . in particular , the chroma @xcite and mimd lattice collaboration @xcite ( milc ) codes have been deployed on cray xt , bluegene / p and recent cluster hardware while the columbia physics system ( cps ) @xcite has been ported to bluegene / p .",
    "considerable effort has been invested in the optimization of high performance components for these architectures .",

    "the mdwf measurements were made with chroma interfaced to mdwf 1.1.4 on surveyor .",

    "the asqtad numbers are from the milc code on intrepid , both machines being at alcf anl , title=\"fig:\",height=230 ]    we show in the left half of figure [ f : perf ] the performance of the mdwf solver on the bluegene / p at anl .",
    "mdwf is an optimized domain wall fermion ( dwf ) conjugate gradients inverter package  developed at mit @xcite  which incorporates several dwf operator variants .",
    "one can see that the single precision solver achieves some 800 mflops / core ( about 25% of peak ) .",
    "the solver performance is roughly constant over a variety of volumes , indicating good strong - scaling and that the recursive data ordering on node results in effective use of cache for the larger problems .",
    "mdwf has been interfaced with chroma for production use , by jefferson lab ( jlab ) staff .",
    "the milc collaboration have optimized their asqtad conjugate gradients solver for the bluegene / p and the cray xt series , and their gauge force for a variety of platforms .",
    "we show the performance of their asqtad inverter on the argonne bluegene / p in the right hand plot of figure [ f : perf ] .",
    "one can see that the weak scaling is excellent all the way out to 32k cores .",

    "the asqtad production was performed using the milc code while the domain wall fermion production was carried out by colleagues based at columbia university and brookhaven national laboratory ( bnl ) using the cps code .",
    "the dramatic increases in production brought about by the bluegene / p for both sets of data production ( red lines ) are clearly evident .    in summary",
    ", usqcd has completed successful ports of its applications to leadership hardware , and is now reaping the benefits in terms of science production .",
    "in preparation for the arrival of multi - core hardware , jlab staff , in collaboration with epcc in edinburgh uk , have added threading support to one of our key computational kernels , called _ wilson dslash _ @xcite .",
    "this kernel is a 4 dimensional nearest neighbor operator .",
    "we show a 2d schematic picture of the communications patterns in this operator in figure [ f : threadsavings ] for a pure mpi implementation on the left , versus a hybrid - threaded one on the right .",
    "two potential efficiency gains are immediate : first , one can see that threading on - node eliminates on - node messaging ( green arrows in the figure ) .",
    "second , the threading effectively coalesces multiple messages that would have been sent by individual cores into fewer , larger messages sent by the node ( red arrows , ellipses in figure ) which may be advantageous in some networks .",
    "communications patterns of the wilson dslash kernel in 2d on a quad core node for a full mpi application ( left ) and a hybrid threaded - mpi application ( right),width=336 ]    multi - threading on node is typically realized using openmp or some custom thread library .",
    "we have developed a lightweight thread library called qcd multi ",
    "thread ( qmt ) @xcite which enables a data parallel programming technique similar in spirit to openmp : work is supplied to qmt by calling the qmt_call ( ) library function , with a call back procedure that can perform part of the desired work .",
    "qmt then invokes this function , with different parts of the problem from different threads .",
    "when qmt_call ( ) completes , it calls a barrier among the threads to synchronize them . in the work described here we used qmt with a queue based barrier , optimized for the moesi cache coherence protocol on amd barcelona cores .",
    "our numerical experiments consisted of running the wilson dslash operator on several nodes of the jaguar cray xt4 system at ornl , either as a pure mpi or as a hybrid mpi - threaded application , using alternately both openmp and qmt for the threading .",
    "we performed our tests on a single node and then repeated them on 16 nodes which could be mapped as a @xmath0 processor grid communicating in 4 directions .",
    "the tests were repeated using several local volumes : @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "in particular the @xmath0 volume is our hard scaling limit with all sites on the surface and the @xmath3 volume is typically too large to be cache resident .",
    "we have found the @xmath2 volume most efficient with @xmath1 volume case less so due to a worse surface to volume ratio .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ f : threading ] .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ f : threading]a ) that on a single node the qmt and mpi performances are essentially identical . looking at results for 16 nodes , we see that the threaded performances are much improved for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 volumes over the pure mpi case . in the cases of",
    "the smallest and largest volumes there seems to be no difference between the pure mpi and hybrid threaded versions . in the situations where threading results in a gain , using qmt for on - node threading results in a higher performance",
    "than when using openmp .",
    "we then performed a weak scaling benchmark for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 local volumes in an attempt to scale the gains from the hybrid - threaded approach up to a large partition .",
    "our results are shown in figure [ f : threading]b ) .",
    "one can see that for both local volumes , a performance advantage is maintained over pure mpi for as far out as 4096 cores when using qmt .",
    "when using openmp , the weak scaling appears quite erratic , but typically performance is less than the qmt case except for the the 4096 core partition size .",
    "our interpretation of these results is as follows : since single node tests suggest no gain from eliminating on - node messages , we surmise that in our application , threading gains performance over pure mpi due to the collation of off - node messages .",
    "this gain is likely to be network and openmp implementation dependent .",
    "our limiting @xmath0 volume is completely communications bound with very few flops to overlap with communication , hence the low performance in that case for all the approaches tried . in the cases of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 volumes , message collation reduces the number of messages and increases their size , thus taking better advantage of the cray network . in the @xmath3 volume case we fall out of cache and all approaches",
    "appear to perform equally .    in this investigation , we have neglected issues that arise in multi - socket numa architectures such as thread , process and memory affinity .",
    "we have also not explored general multi  core aspects such as the abundance of floating point power versus the comparative lack of memory bandwidth .",
    "partitioned global address space languages such as upc provide a natural programming model for numa based architectures , and aggressive prefetching and double buffering may alleviate the memory bandwidth issue to some degree .",
    "some of these concerns are investigated in @xcite and we intend to explore these issues more fully in future work .",
    "our data sharing efforts have continued in the past year by publishing many of our gauge configurations on the international lattice data grid ( ildg)@xcite , and some through other channels @xcite .",
    "our ildg infrastructure is based jointly at fermi national accelerator laboratory ( fnal ) where the storage element is hosted and managed , and at jlab where one can find the metadata and file catalog web services .",
    "some 11,000 configurations are now published in 16 ensembles through the ildg .",
    "conversely , in the past year several us researchers have joined the ildg virtual organization , in order to use published data shared through ildg",
    ".    within usqcd data sharing has moved forward through the definition of file formats for quark propagators and the implementation of software to read and write the standard within the qio library .",
    "application codes have also been modified to read and write these files .",
    "european collaborators have defined propagator formats that are compatible with the usqcd format and there is some hope that worldwide propagator sharing will eventually be formalized in the ildg .",
    "the usqcd software program , continues its work and collaboration in many other areas not discussed here for lack of space , including the application of workflows to qcd , algorithmic developments , improvements to data analysis , code optimization , visualization and the use of grid technologies .",
    "in this contribution , we presented an overview of software progress in lattice qcd in the us over the past year , with emphasis on performance achieved on leadership computers , and our work on multi  core architectures .",
    "much of this work was carried out in international collaboration , in particular with colleagues in the uk .",
    "we intend to continue progress in the software area in the future in order to carry on with our highly successful exploitation of available resources and to continue producing high quality scientific results and discoveries from lattice qcd .",
