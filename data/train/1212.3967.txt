    "positron emission tomography ( pet ) @xcite is an imaging technique capable of detecting picomolar quantities of a labeled tracer with temporal resolution of the order of seconds .",
    "fdg - pet @xcite is a pet modality in which [ @xmath0f]fluoro-2-deoxy - d - glucose(fdg ) is used as a tracer to evaluate glucose metabolism and to detect diseases in many different organs . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "pet ( and , specifically , fdg - pet ) experiments involve two kinds of problems .",
    "first , signal processing techniques are applied to reconstruct the time dependence of location and concentration of tracer from the measured radioactivity .",
    "second , these dynamic pet data can be processed to estimate physiological parameters that describe the functional behavior of the inspected tissues .",
    "this paper focuses on this second aspect and , specifically , examines fdg - pet data from kidneys and bladder , corrected for radiactive decay , to recover information on renal physiology .",
    "the data processed within the paper have been acquired by means of a pet device for small animals ( mice ) , but the mathematical procedure for the treatment of data is essentially the same as for pet data of humans .",
    "the analysis of tracer kinetics in tissues whose activities have been measured with fdg - pet is typically based on compartmental models @xcite .",
    "this conceptual framework identifies different compartments in the physiological system of interest , each one characterized by a specific ( and homogeneous ) functional role ( therefore a compartment is not necessarily represented by a specific organ or anatomical district ) . as any other tracer ,",
    "fdg is injected into the system with a concentration mathematically modeled by the so - called _ time activity curve _ ( tac ) .",
    "the time dependent concentrations of tracer in each compartment constitute the state variables that can be determined from pet data .",
    "the time evolution of the state variables ( the kinetics of the system ) is modelled by a linear system of ordinary differential equations for the concentrations , expressing the conservation of tracer during flow between compartments .",
    "the ( constant ) micro - parameters describing the input / output rates of tracer for each compartment are called _ exchange coefficients _ or _ rate constants _ , represent the physiological parameters describing the system s metabolism and are the unknowns to be estimated .",
    "the particular case of renal physiology is described in figure [ fig : scheme ] , where :    * kidneys include two compartments , tissue ( parenchyma ) and pre - urine , while a third compartment , the urine , represents the bladder , where tracer is accumulated ; * the tac for blood is determined from regions of interest ( rois ) of the left ventricle drawn on fdg - pet maps at different time steps ; * estimates of the tracer concentration for the bladder and for the two compartment system made of parenchyma and pre - urine are obtained by means of rois including bladder and kidneys , respectively ; and , finally , * the set of unknowns is made of six exchange coefficients , also referred to as micro parameters ( other exchange coefficients , for example the ones describing the circulation for the bladder back to the kidneys , are set to zero for well - established physiological reasons ) .",
    "simpler models for tracer circulation inside kidneys can be found in the literature , involving a smaller number of exchange coefficients .",
    "while the reduction in number allows for an estimate of the unknown exchange coefficients by rather simple mathematical procedures ( such as graphical methods , @xcite ) , this implies a notably less refined description of renal physiology .",
    "c    the present paper introduces a novel method for the reduction of compartmental models like this renal one , whose main advantages are a notable generality and limited computational requirements .",
    "this method is based on spectral analysis and statistical optimization and includes two steps . in the first step ,",
    "we solve the direct problem of determining the explicit formal expressions of the tracer concentration in each compartment , under the assumption that the exchange coefficients are given . according to the properties of these coefficients ,",
    "solutions are classified in four different families . consistently with a spectral analysis approach , the concentrations are expressed as linear combinations of the tac convolved with specific exponential functions . in the second step ,",
    "the inverse problem of determining the six unknown exchange coefficients is addressed by means of an ad hoc implementation of ant colony optimization @xcite , which is a statistical optimization algorithm inspired by evolutionary strategies . in this application",
    "the functional to minimize measures the discrepancy between the experimental concentrations and the analytical forms provided by the solution of the forward problem and also accounts for the blood fraction with which the vascular system of the kidneys is fed up .",
    "the paper content is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the cauchy problem modeling the direct problem .",
    "section 3 determines the exchange coefficients by means of statistical optimization .",
    "section 4 shows some applications to synthetic and real pet measurements .",
    "our conclusions are offered in section 5 .",
    "the state variables of the three - compartment model adopted in this paper are the tracer concentrations in the tissue ( @xmath1 ) , in the pre - urine ( @xmath2 ) and in the urine contained in the bladder ( @xmath3 )",
    ". moreover , the kinetic process in the system is initialized by the tac @xmath4 , representing the tracer concentration in blood .",
    "the usual conditions for compartmental analysis hold , e.g. , tracer is uniformly distributed in each compartment at each instant @xcite , diffusive effects are neglected and physiological processes are in a steady state . the six constant exchange coefficients ( flux rate parameters ) between compartments in contact are denoted as @xmath5 , where the suffixes @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the target and source compartment , respectively . for example , @xmath8 is the rate constant of tracer carried `` to '' the bladder pool @xmath9 `` from '' the pre - urine pool @xmath10 .",
    "we assume @xmath11 for all cases .",
    "conservation of tracer exchanged between compartments leads to the following system of linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients : @xmath12 with initial conditions @xmath13 and where the dependence on time is implicit .",

    "the model equations obtained in the previous section describe the time behavior of the tracer concentration in the three compartments of the renal system , given the tac and the transmission coefficients .",
    "given such equations , compartmental analysis requires the determination of the tracer coefficients by    1 .   utilizing measurements of the tracer concentrations provided by nuclear imaging , and 2 .   applying an optimization scheme for the solution of the inverse problem .    in nuclear imaging experiments",
    ", the reconstructed images can provide information on the tracer concentration in the kidneys and in the bladder as well as in the input arterial blood as measured in the left ventricle .",
    "specifically , an acquisition sequence is set up providing count data sets collected at subsequent time intervals . for each data",
    "set , an image reconstruction algorithm is applied , rois are drawn within the left ventricle , the kidneys and the bladder and the corresponding tracer concentrations are computed .",
    "obviously , the tracer concentration in the kidneys is an estimate of @xmath60 plus the tracer carried by the blood contained in the kidneys vascular system .",
    "this last term can not be identified in the images and will be accounted for in the optimization procedure . specifically , the optimization scheme we will implement minimizes , at each time point , the functional @xmath61 where @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the analytical solutions of the direct problem computed at the given time point ; @xmath62 is the concentration measured from the roi in the bladder at the time point ; @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the concentration measured from the roi on the kidneys , @xmath4 is the value of the tac at the specific time value and @xmath65 measures the blood fraction with which the kidneys vascular system is supplied . in the following",
    "we will assume @xmath66 , which is a physiologically sound value @xcite .",
    "the minimization of functional @xmath67 is realized by means of an ant colony optimization ( aco ) scheme @xcite .",
    "aco is a statistical - based optimization method developed in the 1990s with the aim of providing a reliable although not optimal solution to some non - deterministic polynomial - time hard combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "more recently aco has been generalized to continuos domains and has been applied to a wide range of problems .",
    "aco takes inspiration from the way in which ants find and carry food to their nest . while an ant is going back to the nest",
    "after having taken some food , it releases a pheromone trace that serves as a trail for next ants , which are able to reach food detecting pheromone . since the pheromone decays in time , its density is higher if the path to food is shorter and more crowded ; on the other hand , more pheromone attracts more ants and at the end all ants follow the same trail .",
    "this behavior is paraphrased in aco identifying the cost functional @xmath68 with the length of the path to food , and the pheromone traces with a probability density which is updated at each iteration depending on the value of the cost function for a set of states . in practice , at each iteration , the cost function is evaluated on a set of @xmath69 admissible states , and the states are ordered according to increasing values of the cost function . then aco defines a probability distribution which is more dense in correspondence with the cheaper states and , on its basis , @xmath70 new states are extracted .",
    "a comparison procedure identifies the new best @xmath69 states which form the next set of states .",
    "formally the starting point of the algorithm is a set of @xmath69 states @xmath71 such that @xmath72 that are ordered in terms of growing cost , namely , @xmath73 .",

    "the procedure generates @xmath70 new states @xmath82 , enlarging the set @xmath83 to @xmath84 if @xmath85 are the @xmath70 states of @xmath86 of greater cost , the updated @xmath83 is defined as @xmath87 this procedure converges to an optimal solution of the problem by exploiting the fact that the presence of the weights @xmath88 , in the definition of @xmath81 , gives emphasis to solutions of lower costs since @xmath89 this fact , associated with the influence that a proper choice of parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 has on the shape of the gaussian functions , determines the way in which the method tunes the impact of the worse and best solutions .",
    "the algorithm ends when the difference between any two states of @xmath83 is less than a pre - defined quantity or when the maximum allowable number of iterations is reached .",
    "the initial set @xmath83 of trial states is chosen by sampling a uniform probability distribution .",
    "the implementation of aco for the optimization of the exchange coefficients in @xmath67 is based on the following steps :    1 .",
    "the four aco parameters are fixed as follows .",
    "@xmath69 and @xmath70 are chosen as in @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath69 is a multiple of the number of coefficients to optimize plus one and @xmath92 + 1,\\ ] ] where @xmath93 $ ] indicates the floor ; @xmath91 and @xmath90 are fixed searching for a trade off between the risk of a solution space of a too high complexity and the risk of a too high computational demand .",
    "the values of the tracer coefficients are initialized to six random numbers picked up in the interval @xmath94 ( this choice is based on literature @xcite ) .",
    "the aco procedure is then run using as @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 the solutions in the general full matrix case .",
    "if , during the aco iterations , the reconstructed values for the tracer coefficients become statistically consistent with values for which the associated direct problem is described by a triangular or a diagonal matrix , the algorithm automatically switches to utilize the corresponding solution in the computation of @xmath67 .    in the following section",
    "we show how this statistics - based compartmental analysis works in the case of synthetic data and real measurements recorded by a micro - pet system .",
    "compartmental analysis is a valid approach to physiological studies of animal models by means of pet data .",
    "an albira micro - pet system produced by carestream health is currently operational at the irccs san martino ist , genova and experiments with mice are currently performed by using different tracers , mainly for applications to oncology . in this section",
    "we describe the performance of our approach to compartmental analysis in the case of synthetic data simulated by mimicking albira acquisition for fdg - pet experiments .",
    "then we will describe the results of data analysis for two real experiments , performed by using fdg .      in order to produce the synthetic data we started from six initial values for the tracer coefficients .",
    "these selected values generate a matrix @xmath19 and a vector @xmath95 as in ( [ system-4 ] ) and ( [ system-5 ] ) . the corresponding solution for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 associated to the cauchy problem ( [ system-1 ] )",

    "the solutions , represented in figure [ fig : simulated1 ] , left panel , are sampled at 27 time points corresponding to the distribution of acquisition times experimentally performed by albira. the red line in the panel represents the tac @xmath4 that has been obtained by fitting with a gamma variate function a set of real measurements acquired from a healthy mouse in a very controlled experiment @xcite .",
    "the vectors corresponding to the discretization of @xmath1 and @xmath2 are then summed together and affected by poisson noise ; the same kind of noise is applied to the vector corresponding to the discretization of @xmath3 .",
    "aco is applied 30 times to these synthetic data set to obtain 30 sets of reconstructed values of the exchange coefficients ; in correspondence with each set we then computed the concentration curves and super - imposed them in figure [ fig : simulated1 ] , right panel , thus producing confidence strips for the reconstructed concentrations . in table",

    "this paper deals with renal flow of a radioactive tracer , [ @xmath0f]-fdg , injected into a mouse .",
    "the time evolution of tracer concentrations inside kidney and from kidney to bladder has been modeled by a linear system of ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients .",
    "the time variation of the total concentration of activity inside kidney and bladder ( essentially , the sum of the solutions ) has been estimated through an analysis of micro - pet data .",
    "the six constant exchange coefficients , which provide information on system s physiology and metabolism , have been regarded as unknowns .",
    "the related inverse problem has been solved by applying a statistical optimization procedure , referred to by the acronym aco .",
    "resulting applications to real and synthetic data have been shown and discussed .    the mathematical approach described in this paper",
    "provides estimates of the six unknown coefficients . unlike techniques based on graphical analysis",
    ", it does not require any distinction between irreversible or reversible uptake of tracer , nor identification of a time value after which suitable expressions evaluated from the data become linear in time @xcite .",
    "moreover , the graphical methods provide fewer parameters , usually slopes and intercepts , which can be interpreted as functions of the original model parameters @xcite .",
    "technically , the general character of the optimization procedure based on aco makes it applicable to compartmental model structures of a variety of types , provided measured data on the related total concentrations of activity are available .",
    "for example , no practical restriction on the number of compartments involved is required if the direct problems involved in the aco procedure are solved numerically , instead of finding the analytic representation of the solutions , as we have done in the present paper .",
    "similarly , the fully numeric approach does not require limitations such as the constraint that the system matrix is sign - symmetric @xcite ( indeed , the upper and lower triangular matrices considered in section 2 do not comply with sign - simmetry ) .",
    "we have also seen that application of aco to synthetic data corresponding to an upper triangular matrix leads to the final estimate @xmath96 .",
    "this shows that the aco approach is also capable of recovering vanishing rate constants .    the physiological basis for this study relies on the broad utilization of fdg in the diagnosing and staging of cancer .",
    "in fasting patients , this tracer accurately maps the insulin independent glucose metabolism as an index of aggressiveness and growth rate of neoplastic lesions . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", dynamic pet imaging might provide a quantitative estimation of glucose consumption in cancer by measuring tracer rate constants and serum glucose levels .",
    "however , the long acquisition time requested by this approach conflicts with the routine activity since it can not be applied to the whole body , it is hardly tolerated by patients and it markedly reduces the number of diagnostic procedures . to at least partially overcome this limitation ,",
    "current clinical protocols imply that the whole body is imaged in a single shot late after tracer injection . under this condition ,",
    "glucose consumption is approximated by the measurement of tracer accumulation , normalizing for administered radioactivity and distribution mass . however , although this standardized uptake value ( suv ) is usually considered an adequate surrogate of cancer glucose uptake @xcite it also and equally depends upon tracer bioavailability .",
    "most often this latter variable is neglected since blood fdg clearance by tissues is assumed to be relatively stable in the different patients .",
    "nevertheless , differently from glucose , a significant amount of fdg is excreted in the urines .",
    "this tracer sequestration has been already documented and attributed to the low affinity of glucose symporters dedicated to glucose reabsorption from preurine in the kidney tubules @xcite .",
    "our micropet approach offered the unique advantage to simultaneously measure the time concentration curves defining arterial input function ( measured in the left ventricle ) , kidney tracer handling and urinary sequestration in the bladder without any need to evaluate the complex fdg transit in renal pelvis @xcite and its uncertainties .",
    "this direct estimation documented that tracer exchange from preurine to kidney parenchima is extremely low .",
    "kidney glucose reabsorption is an active process by two na+-dependent symporters present in the apical membrane of tubular cells ( sglt-1 and sglt-2 ) .",
    "the hydroxyl groups in d - glucose play a critical role in the recognition and transportation of glucose out of the proximal tubules of the kidney .",
    "removal of the hydroxyl group at the 2 position of d - glucose diminishes the affinity of this molecule for both the forms of sglt @xcite .",
    "urinary excretion has been most often considered as a limitation for fdg in studying cancer of the urinary tract @xcite .",
    "however , the evidence of an extremely low reabsorption of tracer filtered in the preurine has a more general relevance : it implies that tracer loss caused by glomerular filtration markedly affects fdg persistence in the blood .",
    "accordingly , suv might largely differ in cancer lesions characterized by a similar metabolism being lower in patients with preserved glomerular filtration rate and higher in the presence of an impaired renal function .",
    "the disposal of methods able to estimate the relationship between the easily available glomerular filtration rate and fdg bioavailability might thus improve the clinical standardization of tracer uptake as a marker for tumor aggressiveness , beyond the current standard application of suv .",
