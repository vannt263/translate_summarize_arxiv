    "multiple channels of interaction in a network ( or network layers ) can have nontrivial consequences in the system s dynamics and function  @xcite",
    ". effects of introducing new network layers include catastrophic cascades of failure  @xcite , facilitated cascades  @xcite , and a super - diffusive state  @xcite .",
    "most such studies on multiplex networks have assumed identical dynamics for every node . however , many real - world complex systems consist of heterogeneous agents who could respond differently to their multiplex environment . for example , an individual engaging in a multiplex social network may respond to her social influences coming from multiple layers , and how she integrates those layer - level influences may depend on the individual s personal and communal characteristics .",
    "the consequences of such heterogeneous response to the layer - level influences on dynamic processes on multiplex networks have yet to be characterized and understood .",
    "the threshold cascade model has provided a theoretical tool for understanding the spread of behavior in a social network  @xcite and for studying the cascades of `` knock - on '' default among financial institutions  @xcite . in this stylized model ,",
    "nodes exist in one of two states , active or inactive ( e.g. , a person changed behavior or not , a bank has defaulted or not ) .",
    "initially , each node draws a threshold from a distribution @xmath0 .",
    "an inactive node with degree @xmath1 and with @xmath2 active neighbors activates when its fraction of active neighbors , @xmath3 , exceeds its threshold @xmath4 .",
    "the dynamics are iterated starting from a small fraction @xmath5 of initially active `` seed '' nodes , and then the cascade size @xmath6 , the fraction of active nodes in the steady state , is observed .",
    "previous studies showed that , for a wide range of network densities and threshold distributions , even an extremely small seed fraction @xmath7 can activate a finite fraction of an infinite - size network , an event called a global cascade  @xcite .",
    "recently , some studies have generalized the threshold model to temporal networks  @xcite and to multiplex networks  @xcite .",
    "however , cascades with heterogeneous nodal responses to their multiplex environments are not yet addressed . on this basis , in this paper we explore the effects of heterogeneous responses of nodes to their multiple layers in threshold cascade dynamics on multiplex networks by generalizing the previous work @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the model . the analytical approach for calculating the cascade size for multiplex networks with locally - treelike layers",
    "is presented in section iii . in section iv , we discuss results obtained from the analytical calculations introduced in section iii and from numerical simulations .",
    "section v concludes with a discussion of these results and of ways to make the model more realistic .",
    "to keep theoretical simplicity and analytical tractability , we consider a mixture of populations of two types of nodes with simplified response rules  hereafter called `` or nodes '' and `` and nodes '' . or nodes activate as soon as , in at least one layer , a sufficiently large fraction of their neighbors in that layer are active . and nodes are more stubborn : they activate as soon as , in each and every layer , a sufficiently large fraction of their neighbors in that layer are active .",
    "figure  [ fig : model_illustration ] depicts examples of cascades in small networks containing ( a ) all or nodes and ( b ) all and nodes .",
    "although highly stylized , the two types of response rules can be motivated by real - world multiplex system dynamics . in social systems , for instance ,",
    "the or rule would mean that just one social sphere can convince someone to change behavior , whereas the and rule would mean that a person waits to change behavior until receiving enough influence from all social spheres . as another example , in banking systems , the or rule would mean that a bank engaging in multiple kinds of lending defaults if , for at least one type of lending , sufficiently many of its borrowers of that type defaulted and can not repay the bank , whereas the and rule would mean that a bank defaults once enough of its borrowers of every type have defaulted .",
    "the two response rules have opposite effects . if all nodes respond with the or rule as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_illustration](a ) , then the existence of multiple layers facilitates global cascades  @xcite . on the contrary , if more nodes follow the and rule [ as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_illustration](b ) and  [ fig : model_illustration](c ) ] , then global cascades become rare or even impossible . as the system approaches this extreme of inhibited cascades ,",
    "global cascades appear discontinuously as the network densifies .",
    "we show that this phenomenon is associated with a cusp catastrophe and that it suggests ways to promote or to inhibit cascading phenomena in multiplex networks .",
    "to investigate threshold dynamics on multiplex networks with heterogeneous layer responses , we first present the analytical approach for calculating the mean cascade size , applicable to multiplex networks with sparse , locally - treelike layers . the analytic approach developed for the threshold cascade model on single - layer networks  @xcite",
    "can be generalized to the case of multiplex networks with @xmath8-layers ( `` @xmath8-plex networks '' ) @xcite by following a mean - field - type reasoning similar to other models on multiplex networks  @xcite .",
    "the expected size @xmath6 of a cascade begun from a fraction @xmath7 of initially active seed nodes ( chosen uniformly at random ) can be approximated for locally treelike networks as @xmath9 here , we approximate the ( locally treelike ) graph as a tree , and @xmath10 is the ( limiting ) probability that a node is activated by its children , given that its parent in layer @xmath11 is inactive .",
    "@xmath12 is the joint degree distribution of the @xmath8-plex network , with degree vector @xmath13 .",
    "the sum @xmath14 runs over all @xmath8-component vectors @xmath15 , representing the numbers of active neighbors in each layer , and thus having entries @xmath16 for each layer index @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 is shorthand notation for the binomial probability distribution , @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 is the mean response function , the probability that a node with degree @xmath21 and @xmath15 active neighbors activates , averaged over all thresholds ( described in more detail below ) .",
    "equation   gives the probability that a randomly chosen node is either a seed node ( with probability @xmath7 , given by the first term on the righthand side ) or is not a seed node but is activated by its active neighbors through the response function @xmath22 [ given by the second term on the righthand side of eq .  ] .",
    "the probabilities @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) are obtained as the fixed point of coupled recursion equations that are written vectorially as relations , written vectorially as @xmath24 with the @xmath25-th component of   given by @xmath26 starting from @xmath27 for all @xmath28 .",
    "here , @xmath29 is the probability that a node located @xmath30 hops from the leaves of the tree is activated by its children given that its parent in layer @xmath25 is inactive .",

    "the response function @xmath35 is the probability that a randomly - chosen node with degree @xmath21 , among which @xmath15 are active neighbors , and threshold @xmath36 becomes active .",
    "next we introduce a response function that has heterogeneous layer response rules .",
    "a node in an @xmath8-plex network has @xmath37 neighbors in each layer @xmath17 . at a certain point in time",
    ", this node sees that @xmath38 out of its @xmath37 neighbors in layer @xmath25 are active , and the node responds according to one of the two elementary response rules , @xmath39 or @xmath40 , defined as follows .",
    "@xmath39 denotes the `` or rule '' , for which an inactive node activates when , in at least one layer @xmath25 in which it has neighbors ( i.e. , in which @xmath41 ) , the fraction of active neighbors , @xmath42 , exceeds its threshold @xmath43 .",
    "[ recall the example with a small network shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_illustration](a ) . ] this or rule can be implemented in the response function as @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the indicator function ( @xmath46 if @xmath47 is true , else @xmath48 ) .",
    "likewise , the response function of the `` and rule '' , for which nodes activate when enough neighbors in every layer are active [ recall fig .",
    "[ fig : model_illustration](b ) ] , can be written as @xmath49 [ i.e. , replace @xmath50 with @xmath51 in  ] .    in our model , a random fraction @xmath52 ( respectively , @xmath53 ) of nodes in the network follow the or ( and ) rule , called the or ( and ) nodes [ fig .",

    "global cascades occur on the left of the boundaries , which are obtained by finding local maxima of the number of iterations ( noi ) of the recursion   iterated until successive iterates differ by less than @xmath58 ( step sizes @xmath59 ) .",

    "thus , @xmath70 with poissonian degree distribution in each layer , and @xmath71 . extending the formalism to more than two layers is straightforward and presented in part in  @xcite .",
    "( the degree distribution of correlated multiplex networks was introduced  @xcite , and their robustness was recently studied  @xcite . )      first , we illustrate how changing the fraction of or nodes , @xmath52 , either facilitates or inhibits global cascades and can affect the nature of the appearance of global cascades .",
    "we present the @xmath72-phase diagram displaying the regions of mean degree @xmath60 and threshold @xmath73 for which global cascades are likely and unlikely for various @xmath52 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : critical_line](a ) ] . to obtain the boundary separating these parameter regions , we find local maxima of the number of iterations ( noi ) of the recursion relation  , a procedure comparable to examining the divergence of relaxation time at a phase transition in critical phenomena  @xcite and recently applied to cascading failures in interdependent networks",
    "this method more accurately locates the boundaries than the first - order cascade condition used in previous studies  @xcite because it accounts for nodes activated by more than one neighbor .    if @xmath74 , then all nodes follow the or rule  , which maximally facilitates global cascades compared to the single - layer case [ compare the red boundary with the gray region in fig .",
    "[ fig : critical_line](a ) ]  @xcite .",
    "one can also assess the effect of multiplexity by splitting a given network into multiple layers , which is also found to facilitate cascades for @xmath74  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig .  3 ) .",
    "as @xmath52 decreases , more nodes follow the and rule  , which inhibits cascades and hence shrinks the cascade region [ see the orange , green , purple , and blue boundaries in fig .  [",
    "fig : critical_line](a ) ] .",
    "when @xmath52 is less than approximately @xmath75 , the cascade region becomes smaller than the single - layer case , showing that multiplexity can also impede cascades .",

    "the dashed and solid lines indicate the continuous and discontinuous transition , respectively .",
    "the black dot separates two different transition types . for the single - layer model , the mean degree is @xmath77 , and the thresholds are given by @xmath78 for or nodes and @xmath73 for and nodes . for the duplex model ,",
    "the mean degree is @xmath79 in each layer , and the thresholds are given by @xmath73 for all nodes . ]    before proceeding further , we briefly address the issue of reducibility of multiplex dynamics to an equivalent dynamics on single - layer networks with appropriately chosen heterogeneous threshold distributions . in our example",
    ", an intuitive and reasonable choice would be to set the threshold equal to @xmath78 for a fraction @xmath52 of nodes ( to play the role of or nodes ) and equal to @xmath73 for the rest ( to play the role of and nodes ) on a single - layer network with twice the mean degree , @xmath77 , as that of the layers of duplex network .",
    "the obtained ( @xmath80)-phase diagram of this single - layer model is shown in comparison with that of the original multiplex model for @xmath66 , the case chosen deliberately to display discontinuous transitions in the multiplex model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] ) .",
    "the single - layer model differs from the multiplex dynamics not only quantitatively ( different phase boundaries ) but also qualitatively ( different transition types ) .",
    "this result suggests that `` reducing '' the multiplex dynamics into a single - layer model should be highly nontrivial when the layer - dependent response in multiplex dynamics [ such as eqs .   and  ]",

    "not only does reducing the fraction @xmath52 of or nodes inhibit global cascades ; it can also cause cascades to appear discontinuously .",
    "previous work has shown that if every node in a single - layer network has the same threshold @xmath73 , then the mean cascade size @xmath6 grows continuously and then drops discontinuously with increasing mean degree @xmath60  @xcite . in our multiplex model with a mixture of response rules , the small-@xmath60 transition for global cascade changes from continuous to discontinuous when @xmath52 becomes sufficiently small [ fig .",

    "we find that the noi for these small-@xmath60 transitions exhibits a peak at @xmath83 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : critical_line](c ) , inset ] , and later we show that this value is where the continuous transition becomes discontinuous . in passing , we note that a discontinuous appearance of global cascades was also observed in a single - layer network with heterogeneous thresholds , displaying , however , a quite different phase diagram  @xcite .    the bifurcation diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bifcurves ] , inset ) confirms this discontinuous transition .",
    "the fixed points @xmath84 of recursion   are roots of @xmath85 . in numerically simulated cascades ,",
    "we observe only the smallest root ( plotted as red in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : bifcurves ] ) because we consider small seed - sizes @xmath86 .",
    "bifurcation analysis of @xmath87 reveals that the system undergoes a fold catastrophe : as @xmath60 increases from @xmath88 , two new roots appear in a saddle - node bifurcation , and one of those roots ( the unstable one ) annihilates the small , stable root at another saddle - node bifurcation at the small-@xmath60 transition point , leaving only a large stable root ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bifcurves ] ) .",
    "thus , as the network densifies , global cascades appear discontinuously . increasing the fraction @xmath52 of or nodes beyond @xmath67 eliminates the fold catastrophe , thereby restoring the familiar continuous transition  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : mix ] .",
    "the cusp point @xmath92 marks the parameters at which the line of continuous transitions and the line of discontinuous transitions join .",
    "this point can be associated with tricritical behavior when the initial seed size @xmath93 : the continuous transition line undergoes scaling behavior as it crosses - over to the discontinuous one . to describe the crossover behavior ,",
    "one introduces two new variables @xmath94 and @xmath95 ( called `` scaling fields '' ) @xcite , which are tangential and normal , respectively , to the continuous transition line . in the new coordinate system centered at the estimated cusp point @xmath96 , the two scaling fields obey a power - law relation near the origin as @xmath97 with the crossover exponent @xmath98 ( fig .",

    "initial exponential growth ( i , yellow ) is rapidly slowed due to the `` stubborn '' and nodes ( ii , green ) , but once enough nodes are active the activation resumes the exponential growth , and and nodes overtake or nodes ( iii , blue ) , finally reaching saturation ( iv , gray ) . ]",
    "response heterogeneity affects not only whether cascades appear discontinuously ; it also affects who activates when and how slowly the cascade progresses . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : step ] , a typical global cascade near the cusp point can be qualitatively divided into four stages [ labeled i  iv in fig .",
    "[ fig : step](e ) ] .",
    "initially , activation grows exponentially , and the more susceptible or nodes activate in greater numbers than the and nodes , even though or nodes are less numerous ( because @xmath101 in fig .  [ fig : step ] ) . in stage",
    "ii , the rates of activation slow for both types of nodes .",
    "what is particularly interesting about stage ii is that the presence of and nodes significantly delays the global cascade .",
    "if the goal is to prevent large cascades ( as in bank regulation ) , then stage ii provides a crucial window of opportunity for intervention .",
    "after sufficiently many nodes have activated ,",
    "the and nodes activate at a faster rate and eventually overtake the number of active or nodes ( stage iii ) , as there are more and nodes in the network with @xmath101 .",
    "finally , the activations saturate for a finite system ( stage iv ) .",
    "introducing new network layers , such as adding new social media or creating novel ways of lending , can facilitate or impede threshold - driven cascades , depending on how nodes respond to their multiplex surroundings ( fig .",
    "[ fig : critical_line ] ) . for networks in which most nodes can be activated through any one of the layers ( i.e. , for large @xmath52 ) , global cascades become likely  even for networks that would have been too dense to allow global cascades if there were just one channel of influence . by contrast ,",
    "if most nodes wait to activate until their thresholds are met in each and every layer ( i.e. , if @xmath52 is small ) , then global cascades occur rarely , if at all . however , when global cascades do occur in this small-@xmath52 regime , they appear discontinuously ( and at a larger network density ) as the network densifies ( figs .",
    "[ fig : critical_line ] and [ fig : mix ] ) . at the same time , such discontinuous global cascades take considerably longer to develop ( figs .  2 and 5 ) . the and response rule in our model [ eq .  ]",
    "is analogous to the rule of mutual connectivity in mutual percolation on multiplex networks  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the discontinuous transition observed in our model shares a similar origin with that in mutual percolation  type problems in interdependent and multiplex networks  @xcite .",
    "real multiplex complex systems such as social and financial systems have considerably greater structural and dynamical complexity than the model studied here , including , for example , interlayer correlations @xcite , link overlap @xcite , heterogeneous network structure @xcite , heterogeneous thresholds @xcite , and different types of cascading failure dynamics on weighted networks  @xcite , to name only a few . regarding the multiplex response ,",
    "the two simplified response rules studied in this work could be made more realistic by considering , for example , different combinatorial response rules and/or time - dependent , adaptive response rules @xcite .",
    "we hope that our study of a simple theoretical model can aid in stimulating extensions that better capture real cascading phenomena .",

    "<S> threshold cascade models have been used to describe spread of behavior in social networks and cascades of default in financial networks . in some cases </S>",
    "<S> , these networks may have multiple kinds of interactions , such as distinct types of social ties or distinct types of financial liabilities ; furthermore , nodes may respond in different ways to influence from their neighbors of multiple types . to start to capture such settings in a stylized way , we generalize a threshold cascade model to a multiplex network in which nodes follow one of two response rules : some nodes activate when , in at least one layer , a large enough fraction of neighbors are active , while the other nodes activate when , in all layers , a large enough fraction of neighbors are active . varying the fractions of nodes following either rule facilitates or inhibits cascades . </S>",
    "<S> near the inhibition regime , global cascades appear discontinuously as the network density increases ; however , the cascade grows more slowly over time . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior suggests a way in which various collective phenomena in the real world could appear abruptly yet slowly . </S>"
