    "the idea consists in sampling a density of points proportional to the ground state distribution multiplied by an importance function . in standard cases",
    "the importance function will only depend on space coordinates being the spin fixed , thus : @xmath32 this can be shown to introduce a drift in @xmath27 and to modify the weighting factor , which will not only contain the potential , but also the local energy @xmath33 of the system .",
    "the system we are studying is a two - dimensional electron gas at @xmath34 , in presence of both coulomb and rashba interaction , with the addition of a uniform charge background @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the system can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 includes the electron  electron interaction and the effects of the background .",
    "the hamiltonian in this case does not only contain space coordinate dependent potentials .",
    "the rashba interaction , because of its spin - orbit character , contains spin and momentum operators , which therefore can not be treated like simple weighting factors as in the case shown above . in order to apply the dmc technique ,",
    "a new propagator form is needed , taking into account the particular features of non locality and spin - dependence @xcite .    in order to simplify the following calculations",
    "let us first consider the single - particle hamiltonian given by the kinetic term and the rashba interaction for only one electron . by applying trotter s formula the following form of the green s function",

    "the appearance of the spin - rotating factor in the green s function implies that the spin coordinates of the electrons must be explicitly used . making use of a spinorial representation ,",
    "the spin - state for the @xmath5 electron is given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the amplitudes of the spin state in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 basis .",
    "the propagation of the spin  dependent green s function can then be realized with a rotation of spinors . for each electron @xmath8 the spin ",
    "dependent propagator can be written using the following matrix form : @xmath52}\\equiv o_i = \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left (   \\begin{array}{cc }   \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\\delta r_i\\right ) &    \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{d}\\delta r_i\\right)\\frac{-i\\delta",

    "therefore , during the propagation in imaginary time , an electron with initial coordinates @xmath54 , will be first moved to @xmath55 due to the free propagator @xmath27 , and then to @xmath56 due to rotation according to @xmath57    the approximations introduced after eq . generate an error which must be now taken into account at least to order @xmath42 .",
    "if the spin - orbit propagator just derived were correct , we would expect to obtain @xmath58 this equation does not hold unless the propagator is corrected for a weighting factor @xmath59 it is important to note that the results obtained following this approach coincide with the analytical form of the green s function for the system in absence of coulomb potential . in this case",
    "no error is introduced in @xmath60 because the rashba interaction commutes with the kinetic term of the hamiltonian .    by considering the full many  particle hamiltonian , including the coulomb interaction ,",
    "the total green s function is @xmath61 \\delta \\tau}\\times \\nonumber \\\\ e^{-i\\frac{\\lambda}{d } \\sum^n_{i=1}(\\delta r_i^y\\sigma_i^x -\\delta r_i^x\\sigma_i^y)\\delta\\tau }   g_0(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r'},\\delta \\tau)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when a spin - orbit term is introduced in the hamiltonian , as shown before , the propagator will not leave spin unchanged because space coordinate diffusion becomes related to spin rotation .",
    "this means that also the importance sampling should not be naively applied , but in the total weight , a factor @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively are the old and new spin states , should be taken into account .",
    "it is possible to apply the importance sampling adding a drift term in @xmath27 as usual by considering @xmath65 where the two forms of eq .",
    "are equivalent to first order in @xmath66 .",
    "the factor where spins are unchanged can be included as usual , while the second one can be interpreted as an additional weighting factor .",
    "we point out that in this case the local energy appearing in the weight includes only the the spin ",
    "independent part of the hamiltonian .",
    "we used a trial wave function made of a slater determinant of single particle states multiplied by a jastrow factor accounting for correlations , according to the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a two body pseudopotential of the double yukawa form @xcite .",

    "twist averaged boundary conditions ( tabc ) have been introduced in the algorithm @xcite .",
    "as shown in the electron gas without spin  orbit interactions , this allows to obtain good results without the need to use a very large number of electrons , giving therefore a great improvement in terms of the computational time required .",
