    "the study of the discrete symmetries ( charge conjugation ) , (parity ) , , ( motion reversal ) , and has provided many insights as to the underlying structure of the weak interaction .",
    "noether s theorem reminds us that in general we expect that exact symmetries in nature relate to conservation laws .",
    "hence , any conserved symmetry should lead to a corresponding conservation law that underpins some physical phenomenon .",
    "likewise symmetry violation would lead to the consequence that the conservation law did not work exactly , but was at best a rule of thumb that may be used to make estimates with some degree of uncertainty regarding the accuracy of any conclusion inferred ; for example su(3 ) falls into this category of symmetry .",
    "the symmetries and are known to be broken , and the violation of parity discovered by wu in 1957  @xcite was the first experimental signal of how important it was to understand violation of these symmetries for weak interactions .",
    "parity violation led inextricably to the @xmath0 structure of the weak interaction in the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the fact that there are weak decays to flavour specific final states also highlights the presence of violation .",
    "however a remarkable thing at that time was that was found to be conserved .",
    "hence the large violation of parity and charge conjugation was such that it balanced in the combination .",
    "this assertion remained true until 1964 , when cronin , fitch , christenson and turlay discovered violation in neutral kaon decay as a consequence of trying to improve our understanding of regeneration  @xcite .",
    "it was quickly noted by sakharov as to how important violation was for cosmology  @xcite . without and violation",
    "the matter and antimatter manifest in the big bang would annihilate each other and the residual universe would have been devoid of the large imbalance that we observe today .",
    "it is interesting to note that since that discovery we have found several other manifestations of violation , and also tested the level of violation .",
    "however it took 45 years from the initial discovery for direct violation to be found in kaons  @xcite@xcite . a few years after this",
    ", large ( 10% level ) violation was found studying the longitudinal polarisation basis of a rare decay to a four body final state  @xcite@xcite . on the theoretical side a model of violation",
    "was proposed by kobayashi and maskawa , building on earlier work concerning quark mixing by cabibbo  @xcite@xcite .",
    "with hindsight , after several decades of detailed experimentation , it turns out that this model is the correct leading order description of violation in the sm .",
    "it is worth noting that just as in the case of and violations balancing to conserve ( most of the time ) , that the measured levels of and violation balance such that overall is conserved .",
    "the ramifications of conservation include lorentz invariance , which underpins our understanding of modern physics . at some energy scale",
    "it is expected that quantum effects will become important when trying to describe space - time , and a consequence of this would be lorentz violation , and hence violation . thus far however , experimental evidence continues to support both lorentz and invariance .",
    "the remainder of these proceedings focus on the tests of these discrete symmetries from the perspective of results , with a brief historical interlude followed by more recent results .",
    "the avid reader should refer to the physics of the for more details  @xcite .",
    "the , the experiment and 2 collider at the slac national accelerator laboratory and the belle experiment and kekb collider at kek , were built to discover violation in the decay of neutral mesons .",
    "this primary goal drove the teams building those experimental facilities to build in safety margins in order to be sure that the mission would be accomplished , even if violation turned out to be much smaller than expected by many theorists of the day .",
    "nature was kind , and in 2001 unveiled results showing violation in the decay of a @xmath1 quark to a @xmath2 final state ( modes such as @xmath3 , and @xmath4 were included in this discovery ) .",
    "that was quickly confirmed by , firmly establishing that indeed violation was exhibited in decay , and that it was large .",
    "these two results were published as back - to - back articles in phys .",
    "lett .  @xcite@xcite .",
    "in contrast with kaons , it only took a further two years before direct violation was established in @xmath5 decays via the decay @xmath6 . both violation in the interference between mixing and decay amplitudes and direct violation turned out to be order one effects in decays , in contrast to the @xmath7 levels seen in kaons .",
    "the foresight that led to including safety margins in the design of the has resulted in a richer and broader physics programme than originally envisaged .",
    "banuls and bernabeu proposed using entangled pairs of mesons to test , , and asymmetries  @xcite as a generalisation of the kabir asymmetry measurement proposed in 1970  @xcite that used only a flavour filter basis . using two pairs of orthonormal states , one based on @xmath1-quark flavour and one based on eigenvalue ,",
    "are able to measure 12 asymmetries of which there are four distinct tests of each of , , and  @xcite .",
    "the methodology relies on comparing some reference process with that of the symmetry conjugated one as a function of proper time between two events for the entangled pair of mesons evolving into their flavour and decay filters . the first event is marked by the collapse of the entangled wave function ( at some time @xmath8 ) which coincides with the decay of one of the @xmath9 mesons in the entangled pair , and the second event is marked by the decay of the remaining @xmath9 ( at time @xmath10 ) .",
    "for example one of the four tests of involves comparing the time - dependent ( @xmath11 ) rate of @xmath12 with that of the conjugate transition @xmath13 .",
    "subscript refers to the eigenvalue of the decay filter ; in this case it is odd , corresponding to @xmath14 .",
    "the other pairings of reference and transformed transitions can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite@xcite . ] the standard flavour tagging techniques developed for the violation discovery measurement are used in order to select and mesons , and the selection of even and odd filter basis pairs , for @xmath15 transitions differ by a vs a in the final state ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "as reported in @xcite , the data are consistent with both and violation , whilst is conserved . the significance reported for the observation of violation ( assuming gaussian uncertainties ) exceeds @xmath16 .",
    "thus the level of and violation balance each other .",
    "a number of related measurements have recently been proposed  @xcite@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite is a recent review on violation measurements in mesons , which may be of interest to the reader .    using only a flavour filter basis pair one can define two additional asymmetries .",
    "one of these is the kabir asymmetry , which tests and ( in mixing ) , and the other tests and .",
    "the corresponding asymmetry is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are parameters related to mixing and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are event yields .",
    "the sm expectation for @xmath22 is @xmath23  @xcite@xcite@xcite , which is beyond current experimental reach , however large enhancements are possible in the presence of physics beyond the sm ( c.f .",
    "the d0 measurement of this quantity for @xmath24 mesons  @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "traditional measurements searching for ( and ) violation in mixing use semileptonic decays of mesons ( see for example section 17.5 of  @xcite ) . the experimental signature typically used for this measurement is a pair of semi - leptonic decays reconstructed with same sign leptons , as the first meson decays to fix the initial flavour of the un - decayed , and that meson subsequently mixes before decay .",
    "however those results are systematically limited by the size of control samples to estimate the level of wrong sign events . as a consequence",
    "it is interesting to attempt other ways of performing the same test .",
    "have recently performed a measurement using a combination of hadronic and semi - leptonic tags in order to explore an experimentally distinct final state with the hope of bypassing the traditional systematic limitations .",
    "the semi - leptonic decay @xmath25 with a partially reconstructed @xmath26 is used for this measurement where the asymmetry between @xmath27 and @xmath28 observed in data includes the effect of mixing , and of charge reconstruction bias in the detector , both of which have to be corrected for in order to determine @xmath22 .",
    "hadronic decays used in this analysis are `` kaon tagged '' events , where a neutral meson decays into a final state with a charged kaon .",
    "the charge asymmetry observed in data for these events , in addition to including an overall detector bias , has a correction from the asymmetry in reconstructing the charged kaon , arising from the difference in nuclear cross sections of @xmath29 and @xmath30 in detector material .",
    "the measured value of @xmath22 is @xmath31 , which is compatible with expectations .",
    "however , the uncertainties are considerably larger than the sm level and dominated by systematic uncertainties associated with peaking background contributions and the @xmath32 ( the proper time difference between the decay of the semi - leptonic and hadronic decays in the event ) resolution function model .",
    "hence these uncertainties can be further reduced with input from larger data samples in the future .",
    "has also measured asymmetries for a number of rare decays , and the contribution by simon akar to these proceedings gives a review of some of those recent measurements .",
    "has also searched for violation in charm decays . the details can be found in  @xcite , where time - integrated and time - dependent analyses have been performed . in recent years",
    "there has been a resurgence of interest in this area for two reasons ( i ) charm mixing is now firmly established , which sets the scale for mixing - dependent effects to be manifest and opens the door for such measurements , and ( ii ) in 2011 lhcb reported time - integrated asymmetry difference between @xmath33 and @xmath34 modes that was non trivial . the latest results are compatible with no evidence for violation  @xcite .",
    "there is also interest in the study of triple product asymmetries that probe violation using the longitudinal polarisation basis of a decay ( c.f .",
    "kaon decays ) , in particular the decay modes @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 have been studied  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the results are consistent with conservation , in line with expectations that the charm system exhibits small weak phase differences in the sm , hence small levels of violation .",
    "a recent re - analysis of the data was presented at ckm ",
    "14  @xcite using the methodology introduced in ref .",
    "this shows non - trivial and violations for the @xmath38 and @xmath39 decay , but not for @xmath40 .",
    "these results may ultimately yield deeper insights on the weak interaction and hadronisation .",
    "searches for violation are not confined to quark interactions and following cleo and s lead , has measured the direct asymmetry of @xmath42 . a non - trivial level of violation is expected as a result of the neutral kaon in the final state , as well as -interference and regeneration effects .",
    "the result obtained @xmath43 is compatible with no evidence for violation , however this lies @xmath44 from the sm expectation of @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "in summary has performed many interesting tests of discrete symmetries for @xmath9 , @xmath46 , and @xmath41 decays , and has observed several symmetry violations in meson decay . while stopped taking data several years ago , it is still producing results that are competitive and able to teach us something new about the behaviour of the weak interaction and of these discrete symmetries .",
