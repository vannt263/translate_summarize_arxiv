    "theoretical models predict that sub - stellar objects are much more luminous and hotter when very young ( burrows et al .",
    "consequently , deep imaging surveys of young clusters can yield very low mass sub - stellar objects that will be too faint to study once they have aged , unless they are located extremely close to the sun .",
    "hence , the very low end of the initial mass function can be more effectively probed in young clusters .",
    "several groups have reported deep infrared surveys of young star - forming regions at distances ranging from 140 - 450 pc ( luhman et al .",

    "one way to distinguish between young and old brown dwarfs is to look for gravity - sensitive spectral features .",
    "the radius of field brown dwarfs varies only slightly with mass and age , and therefore the surface gravity ( @xmath2 ) is determined by the mass ( log g@xmath05 ) . at a young evolutionary stage however , lower mass objects will have effective temperatures corresponding to those of late m or early l dwarfs .",
    "furthermore , the radius of these young objects can be as much as three times greater than their eventual equilibrium state ( burrows et al .",
    "2001 ) . as a result",
    ", young objects can exhibit significantly lower surface gravities ( 10 - 100 times ) than the more massive evolved dwarfs of the same spectral type .",

    "gorlova et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that the neutral potassium ( k i ) lines in the @xmath1-band are also sensitive to surface gravity .",
    "in this current paper we present the first results from our survey that focus on young brown dwarfs and their surface gravity spectral indicators .",
    "we show that for ages @xmath85 myr , not only are the k i lines and the feh feature in the @xmath1-band very weak for a given spectral type , but also infrared tio and vo bands , normally not present at the boundary between m and l dwarfs in the old field population , are present for the lowest mass objects .",
    "we also reveal that the optical spectra of very young brown dwarfs exhibit weaker lines of k i , na i , rb i , and cs i ; weaker bands of cah ; and stronger bands of vo than field dwarfs of the same spectral class .",

    "they also claimed a lithium detection of 4.3@xmath120.5   ew , another indication of youth . a spectral type of l1.5@xmath120.5 was assigned based upon the optical spectrum .",

    "( 2001 ) who determined its spectral type to be m9.0@xmath120.5 .",
    "finally , and most importantly , we observed the mira variable io virginis ( m9.5 iii+ ) as a template for very low gravities ( log g@xmath00 ) .",
    "near - infrared ( near - ir ) observations were made with nirspec on the keck ii telescope , using a 0.43   slit to yield a resolution of r@xmath15 2000 at @xmath1-band ( 1.14 - 1.36 ) .",
    "the @xmath1-band was chosen because it contains four strong lines of neutral potassium , feh bands , and a strong 2o band useful for spectral classification ( m03 ) .",
    "a detailed description of nirspec is given elsewhere ( mclean et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "observations were made as a sequence of nodded pairs by positioning the object at two locations along the slit separated by @xmath020 .",
    "each exposure was 300 s and at least two nodded pairs were obtained for each source , giving total integration times of 20 - 60 minutes .",
    "the typical signal - to - noise ratio per resolution element for these observations is 20 - 30 , with the exception of @xmath3 ori 51 which has a signal - to - noise of @xmath010 .",
    "data extraction and reduction techniques were carried out using redspec , the nirspec reduction package ( see m03 for details ) .",
    "optical spectra were obtained at the keck i telescope using the low resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) . for most of the observations listed in table 1 ,",
    "the setup and reduction procedures were identical to those discussed in kirkpatrick et al .",
    "the only exception is the spectrum of g 196 - 3b , which is pieced together from two different lris setups .",
    "the first setup was used on 1999 mar 04/05 , resulting in an 9 - resolution spectrum of g 196 - 3b from 6300 to 10000  . on 2001 feb 19 we used the 300 lines / mm grating blazed at 5000   to cover the interval from 3800 to 8500  .",
    "reductions were identical , and the resulting spectrum has a slightly lower resolution of 11  . because the blue spectrum was taken in better sky conditions , we have constructed a 6300 - 10000   spectrum for g 196 - 3b by combining both data sets : 1999 mar data for @xmath16 @xmath17 8500   and 2001 feb data for @xmath16 @xmath18 8500  .",
    "spectra obtained on 2003 jan 02/03 and 2001 feb 19 have been corrected for telluric absorption .",
    "this was accomplished by observing a g0 dwarf at similar airmass shortly before or after the target observation and interpolating the continuum across the telluric bands to determine the correction .",
    "figure 1 shows the nirspec @xmath1-band spectrum of io vir compared with that of kpno - tau4 and g 196 - 3b .",
    "a remarkable feature in the @xmath1-band spectra is the appearance of a broad absorption band near 1.24 in both the mira variable io vir and the young m9.5 dwarf kpno - tau4 .",
    "these bands are probably not the result of feh , as related features at 1.20 are very weak or absent .",
    "we instead identify these features as the @xmath4 ( @xmath19 ) bandheads of tio ( galehouse et al .",
    "a second feature near 1.18 is attributed to the a - x ( @xmath19 ) band of vo ( cheung et al .",
    "these oxide bands are common in the late type @xmath1-band spectra of mira variables ( hinkle et al .  1989 ; joyce et al .  1998 ) and apparently also present in the low gravity atmospheres of young brown dwarfs .",
    "the k  i doublets ( 1.168,1.177 and 1.243,1.254 ) are absent in the cool , low - gravity atmosphere of io vir and only weakly present in the spectrum of kpno - tau4 , consistent with the behavior noted by gorlova et al .",
    "the 2o band at 1.34 in kpno - tau4 is deeper than expected for an m9.5 object , being more consistent with a l2 dwarf ( m03 ) .",
    "this effect could likely be the result of the 2o band showing some slight sensitivity to gravity , as is the case in giant star atmospheres , but the effect is much less noticable than for the k  i lines .",
    "the spectrum of the l2 dwarf g 196 - 3b exhibits similar features .",
    "the deep absorption in the range 1.14 - 1.20 can be attributed to a mixture of vo , tio and possibly 2o .",
    "we have confirmed the identification of the tio and vo bands by observing these objects at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath10-band ) where the fundamental transitions ( @xmath20 ) are easily detected .",
    "we conclude that the presence of tio & vo , weak k i lines and weak feh absorption in the near - ir spectra of kpno - tau4 and g 196 - 3b are indicative of low surface gravity and hence support their identification as young , low - mass brown dwarfs .",
    "figure 2 shows lris spectra of io vir , kpno - tau 4 , 2massw j0149090 + 295613 ( hereafter , 2m0149 + 29 ; from liebert et al .",
    "1999 ) , g 196 - 3b , and kelu-1 ( from kirkpatrick et al .",
    "the top three spectra show the effects of differing gravity in late m stars .",
    "the m giant io vir exhibits the hallmarks of low - gravity , with very weak or non - existent absorptions by k i and na i , weak absorption by cah , and strong , bowl - shaped depressions by vo .",
    "the presumably solar - age field dwarf 2m0149 + 29 ( m9.5 v ) shows the hallmarks of higher gravity  strong absorptions by k i and na i , strong absorption by cah , and less pronounced features attributable to vo .",
    "the spectrum of kpno - tau 4 shows spectroscopic characteristics intermediate between the field dwarf and the giant ( cf .",
    "briceo et al .",
    "such a gravity signature is expected for a dwarf that is much less massive and/or more extended than a higher mass field counterpart of similar temperature .",
    "this result is consistent with kpno - tau 4 being young .",
    "the bottom two spectra of figure 2 show the young l2 dwarf g 196 - 3b compared to the presumably older field l2 dwarf kelu-1 . again",
    "the spectrum of the younger ( lower - mass ) object shows the signatures of lower gravity , most notably the weaker lines of the alkali elements k i , rb i , na i , and cs i. the li i line shows the opposite effect , as lithium has been largely depleted in the more massive kelu-1 , but is retained in the lower mass brown dwarf g 196 - 3b ( rebolo et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "we now consider the @xmath3 orionis objects .",
    "based on the near - ir and optical signatures of low gravity established in figures 1 and 2 , the comparison of the @xmath1-band and optical spectra of @xmath3 ori 47 and 51 in figures 3 and 4 , respectively , is revealing .",
    "the @xmath1-band spectrum of @xmath3 ori 47 contains strong k  i lines , moderate feh absorption at 1.20 and relatively deep 2o absorption at 1.34 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath1-band spectrum of @xmath3 ori 51 has very weak k  i lines and very weak feh absorption .",
    "although the tio and vo bands are not detected , the weakness of the k  i lines and feh band in the @xmath1-band spectrum of @xmath3 ori 51 is consistent with it being a lower gravity object .",
    "a comparison of the 2o absorption band at 1.34 to the bdss sample ( m03 ) shows that the depth of this band matches most closely with an l0-l1 dwarf for @xmath3 ori 51 .",
    "again , a slightly later ir spectral type suggests that , at our resolution of r@xmath02000 , we could likely be detecting some sensitivity of the 2o band to gravity .",
    "the absence of the @xmath1-band tio and vo bands in @xmath3 ori 51 may be attributed to its somewhat higher surface gravity as compared to kpno - tau4 because of its older age ( @xmath05 myr compared to @xmath01 myr ) and warmer atmosphere although veiling is a viable alternative hypothesis .",
    "the strength of the near - ir spectral features observed in @xmath3 ori 47 are consistent with the known field dwarf 2mass 0345 + 35 ( l0 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "1997a ) plotted at the top of figure 3 for comparison .",
    "based on the equivalent width of the k i lines and the strength of the 2o band at 1.34 , the near - ir data support the conclusion that @xmath3 ori 47 appears to be a much older l0@xmath120.5 dwarf .",
    "figure 4 shows lris spectra for these objects .",
    "a comparison of the spectrum of @xmath3 ori 51 to the m star spectra in figure 2 confirms that it has the signatures of lower gravity , most notably weak na i , bowl - shaped depressions by vo , and weak cah , demonstrating that it is a young object .",
    "for @xmath3 ori 47 , we find that the opposite is true , in contradiction to the claims of zapatero osorio et al .",
    "inset ( a ) in figure 4 shows a comparison of the spectra of g 196 - 3b ( from figure 2 ) and @xmath3 ori 47 in the region around the 6708   li i line .",
    "we find no lithium line down to 2   ew ( li i in g 196 - 3b has ew=6  ) .",
    "inset ( b ) shows a comparison of @xmath3 ori 47 to the low - gravity dwarf g 196 - 3b and to the presumably high - gravity l1.5 v field dwarf 2massw j0832045@xmath21012835 ( hereafter , 2m0832 - 01 ; kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2000 ) in the region near the other alkali lines .",
    "the @xmath3 ori 47 spectrum shows a strong na i doublet at 8183 and 8195   like that of a field l dwarf .",
    "fortunately , this na i doublet falls in a region with very little contamination by telluric oh emission , so the spectrum here is less noisy . even in the wavelength regions where residual oh emission causes more of a problem , such as near the rb i and cs i lines at 7800 , 7948 , and 8521  , absorptions by the alkali elements are obvious and of comparable strength to the absorptions in a field l dwarf .",
    "we classify @xmath3 ori 47 in the optical as an l1.5 , the same spectral type assigned to 2m0832 - 01 , and suggest that within the uncertainties the two spectra are identical .",
    "hence @xmath3 ori 47 appears to be an old , high - mass , field l dwarf .",
    "the l1.5 optical spectral type and 2mass j magnitude of 17.53@xmath120.24 suggest a distance of 120 pc ( see eq . 1 from kirkpatrick et al .",
    "2000 ) , roughly a factor of three closer than the cluster itself .",
    "the higher gravity implies an age closer to that of the sun , which means the mass of this l dwarf is near the stellar / substellar break of 0.075 - 0.080 @xmath22 ( burrows et al .",
    "we conclude that this object shows no signs of youth , is unassociated with the cluster , and is not an object `` reaching the mass boundary between brown dwarfs and giant planets '' near 0.015 @xmath22 as originally reported ( zapatero osorio et al .",
    "the identification of gravity - sensitive spectral features is a powerful technique in the study of brown dwarfs . by comparison with a known object of lower surface gravity ( log g@xmath00 )",
    ", several indicators of low gravity in brown dwarfs have been identified .",
    "we have shown empirically that in the @xmath1-band the @xmath4 ( @xmath19 ) bandheads of tio and the a - x ( @xmath19 ) band of vo appear in very young late - type m or early l objects as a result of low surface gravity .",
    "this is the first detection of these bands in a sub - stellar object . in slightly older brown dwarfs weak feh and k  i features",
    "indicate low gravity .",
    "absorption from 2o in the @xmath1-band is slightly greater than expected for the given spectral type . in optical spectra ,",
    "weak alkali lines of na  i , k  i , rb  i and cs  i , but strong li  i absorption , together with weak cah and strong vo absorption are indicative of low gravity .",
    "older late - m and early - l dwarfs with higher surface gravity always exhibit strong alkali lines in both the visible and near - ir , strong feh in the @xmath1-band , and strong cah around 7000  .",
    "for kpno - tau4 and @xmath3 ori 51 we find optical and infrared spectral features consistent with low gravity and youth , a necessary condition for membership in a young cluster .",
    "g 196 - 3b is also confirmed as a young brown dwarf , consistent with it being coeval with its more massive companion . @xmath3",
    "ori 47 however , does not exhibit any of the features of low surface gravity and we conclude that it is not young and therefore not a low - mass member of the @xmath3 orionis cluster , but instead an early - l field dwarf with a mass near the stellar / substellar boundary .",

    "<S> , we observed and analyzed @xmath1-band and optical spectra of two young brown dwarfs , g 196 - 3b ( 20 - 300 myr ) and kpno tau-4 ( 1 - 2 myr ) , and two possible low mass brown dwarfs in the @xmath3 orionis cluster ( 3 - 7 myr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we report the identification of the @xmath4 bands of tio near 1.24 and the a - x band of vo near 1.18 together with extremely weak @xmath1-band lines of k i in kpno - tau4 . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first detection of tio and vo in the @xmath1-band in a sub - stellar mass object . </S>",
    "<S> the optical spectrum of kpno - tau4 exhibits weak k  i and na  i lines , weak absorption by cah , and strong vo bands , also signatures of a lower gravity atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> g 196 - 3b shows absorption features in both wavelength regions like those of kpno - tau4 suggesting that its age and mass are at the lower end of published estimates . whereas @xmath3 ori 51 appears to be consistent with a young sub - stellar object , @xmath3 ori 47 shows signatures of high gravity most closely resembling an old l1.5/l0 , and can not be a member of the @xmath3 orionis cluster . </S>"
