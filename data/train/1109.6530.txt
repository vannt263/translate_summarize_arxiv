    "these quantum applications require robust cavity - qed based qd devices that rest on the ability to manipulate and control the underlying quantum processes .",
    "such quantum control is usually obtained when the cavity and qd are in the intermediate to strong coupling regime  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental studies have focussed on resonance fluorescence of a qd coupled to a cavity mode  @xcite , and significant progress has been made in the study of an off - resonant qd cavity system that is used to observe resonance fluorescence of a single photon emitter  @xcite .",
    "semiconductor micropillar systems are particularly attractive since a geometrical separation between the pump field and emitted fluorescence signal can be made , facilitating nonlinear quantum optical studies such as intensity power broadening  @xcite .",
    "for semiconductor cavity - qed systems , signatures of acoustic phonon processes have been noted with _",
    "incoherent _ excitation , resulting in off - resonant `` cavity feeding ''  @xcite and an asymmetric ( _ on - resonance _ ) vacuum rabi doublet  @xcite .",
    "various phonon - coupling models have been developed to try and explain these features  @xcite ; for example , data obtained for the linear spectrum of single site - selected dots in cavities show good agreement with photon green function theories  where the phonon coupling is included as a self - energy correction to the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "recently , several works have also experimentally investigated _",
    "coherent _ power ( intensity ) broadening in semiconductor cavity - qed systems .",
    "for example , majumdar _ et .",
    "@xcite studied the role of phonon - mediated dot - cavity coupling on the power broadened pl intensity for a planar photonic crystal system ; with experiments performed at temperatures of @xmath1-@xmath2  k on self - assembled inas qds , the cavity - emitted intensity pl were found to have extraneously broadened linewidths relative to a bare qd ( when compared with calculations from a simple atomic me ) . while _",

    "@xcite have demonstrated that dephasing and coupling due to acoustic phonons is likely the primary ( and _ intrinsic _ ) mechanism that couples the qd and the spectrally detuned cavity mode ; their experiments were performed using self - assembled ingaas / gaas qds embedded in a single cavity layer of a semiconductor micropillar cavity . while the important role of electron - phonon scattering on the linear absorption and emission spectra of self - assembled qds is now becoming better established  @xcite , there appears to be little theoretical work describing phonon effects on pl power broadening in a semiconductor cavity - qed system .",
    "nonlinear resonance fluorescence of an ingaas qd embedded in a high - quality micropillar cavity was recently investigated by ulrich _",

    "@xcite , where , in contrast to atomic cavity - qed , a clear indication of excitation - induced dephasing ( eid ) was found to manifest in a mollow triplet spectra with pump - induced spectral sideband broadening . without cavity interactions , it is well known that the interaction of the driven qd with the underlying phonon reservoir can introduce additional dephasing processes and acoustic phonon sidebands  @xcite . in a cavity system",
    ", these phonon processes can also result in significant coupling between a non - resonant cavity and a qd exciton .",
    "very recently , a polaron master equation ( me ) description of phonon - induced eid in qds and cavity - qed was described by roy and hughes  @xcite ; mccutcheon and nazir have also adopted a polaron me approach to describe pule - excited excitons ( without cavity interactions )  @xcite . in light of these phonon scattering studies and the emerging class of semiconductor cavity - qed experiments , the inclusion of phonon - scattering in the theoretical description of pl power broadening in a cavity - qd system is highly desired .",
    "more generally , one desires accurate quantum optical descriptions of the semiconductor cavity - qed system , where important electron - phonon interactions are accounted for .    in this paper",
    ", we present a quantum me formalism to study the intensity power broadening of a semiconductor cavity - qed system and identify the qualitative features of power broadening in the intensity pl introduced due to electron - phonon interactions .",
    "we exploit a time - convolutionless me ( i.e. , local in time ) for the reduced density matrix of the dot - cavity subsystem , where the system - bath incoherent interaction is treated to second order  @xcite .",
    "the perturbative treatment is performed in the polaron frame which allows us to study the effects of phonon dephasing on the coherent part of the hamiltonian exactly .",
    "importantly , the cw laser driving the qd introduces additional eid effects in addition to pure dephasing due to the phonon reservoir  @xcite . in the appropriate limits ,",
    "the model fully recovers the independent boson model ( ibm )  @xcite and the jaynes - cummings model .",
    "the polaron transform is particularly convenient for studying qd cavity - qed systems as it eliminates the exciton - phonon coupling and introduces a modified dot - cavity coupling and a modified radiative decay rate  @xcite ; in addition , there is a phonon - induced renormalization of the qd resonance frequency through the polaron shift . in the case of an exciton driven system , the rabi frequency of the cw laser",
    "is also renormalized by a temperature - dependent factor which essentially accounts for the dephasing of the cw drive due to phonon coupling .",
    "a similar polaron me approach was previously derived by wilson - rae and imamogl  @xcite , who studied the linear absorption spectrum of a cavity - qed system ; however , their me form  @xcite was non - local in time and is substantially more difficult to solve than the time - convolutionless form  @xcite .    for our coherently - pumped cavity - qed investigations ,",
    "we consider two distinctly different pumping scenarios : @xmath3 the qd is driven by a coherent continuous wave ( cw ) laser field , and @xmath4 the cavity mode is driven by a coherent cw laser field .",
    "we describe the generic features arising due to the relative interplay between phonon - induced dot cavity coupling and eid in the case of a qd driven system , and compare and contrast with power broadening for a cavity driven system ; we also discuss the differences in the integrated pl ( ipl ) for a dot - driven and cavity - driven system . for strong coherent drives ( fields ) ,",
    "the intensity pl contain significant phonon bath signatures over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "to help explain the effects of phonon scattering in these systems , we also derive an effective phonon me , of the lindblad form which is shown , in certain regimes , to yield very good agreement with the full polaron me .",

    "the dynamics of a strongly confined qd can be modeled by considering a quantized electron - hole excitation , where the electron occupies a conduction band state and the hole occupies a valence band state . neglecting quantum spin , the dominant features of a strongly confined qd can be described by the two lowest energy bound states .",
    "this two - level model is then conditioned by the interaction of the electrons with the lattice modes of vibration , i.e. , the acoustic phonons . when the effective two - level system is driven by a cw laser field",

    "transforming to the polaron frame , we eliminate the qd - phonon coupling and introduce a renormalized dot - cavity coupling strength  @xcite . for the case of the qd driven system , the polaron transformation also results in a renormalized rabi frequency , defined below .",

    "the usual ( but in general , _ incorrect _ ) decomposition of the system hamiltonian to include only the noninteracting qd and cavity parts does not take into account the effect of the coherent cw drive on the system hamiltonian . as the cavity and the qd systems",

    "the benefits of our polaron me is that the solution , even with multiphonon and multiphoton effects included , is relatively straightforward , and it has already been used to help explain experiments for coherently - excited dots in the regime of cavity - qed  @xcite . moreover , as we will show below , one can derive a user - friendly lindblad me that contains many of the key features of phonon interactions in cavity - qed systems .    for numerical calculations , we solve the above me with steady - state pumping ( i.e. , @xmath20 are time - independent ) , with the exciton initially in the ground state . prior to these dynamical calculations , we compute the phonon scattering terms in eq .",

    "thus there are no fixed phonon scattering rates for analyzing qd power broadening as a function of pump power , as the phonon scattering rates are pump - dependent .",
    "the same arguments apply for studying power broadening as a function of temperature ; one must obtain the phonon - induced scattering rates for each pump value and temperature .",
    "experimentally , the intensity pl lineshape is usually obtained by measuring the qd exciton intensity ( @xmath67 ) or cavity mode intensity ( @xmath68 ) as a function of increasing pump field . to connect to these quantities , we solve the above me in a jaynes - cummings basis with states @xmath69 , and compute the steady - state exciton and cavity photon populations , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "we make partial use of the _ quantum optics toolbox _ by tan  @xcite , and find that truncation to two - photon - correlations ( two photons or 5 states ) is sufficient / necessary for all the dot driven simulations , while truncation to six - photon - correlations ( six photons or 13 states ) is sufficient / necessary for all cavity calculations that follow .",

    "[ multiphoton_section ] .",
    "our polaron me [ eq .  ( [ sec3eq3 ] ) ] includes both coherent and incoherent contributions from electron - phonon scattering , but some care and insight is needed in extracting the relevant incoherent scattering rates .",
    "it is therefore instructive to construct a simplified phonon - modified me of the lindblad form , which we call an _ effective _ phonon master equation ( epme ) ; we do this by simplifying the term , @xmath79 , appearing in the full time - convolutionless me [ eq .  ( [ sec3eq3 ] ) ] .",

    "further , for a qd - driven system we only include terms proportional to @xmath81 and @xmath82 and ignore cross terms proportional to @xmath83 ; the inclusion of the cross terms do not preserve the lindblad form and contribute very little to the overall broadening lineshape as can be demonstrated numerically . for a cavity - driven system , we again include the phase evolution of the operators @xmath80 with respect to the noninteracting part of the system evolution ; however , the effective lindblad description has only contributions which are proportional to @xmath84since @xmath80 do not depend on @xmath85 .",

    "this approach enables us to treat the coherent interaction between the qd , cavity and the cw laser field to all orders .",
    "central to this approach is the need to account for the internal coupling effects which preserves the detail balanced condition on the system density operator .",

    "we computed the full intensity pl lineshape over a range of frequencies and extracted approximate lorentzianlike linewidths of the @xmath220 fwhm of the power broadening intensity pl for both the qd - driven and cavity - driven system .",
    "the interaction of the qd with the phonon reservoir is seen to introduce qualitatively different features in the intensity pl , especially at high temperatures , and is quite distinct from the case of a typical power broadening lineshape of a two - level atom .",
    "we found a significant narrowing of the qd resonance due to the coherent renormalization of the rabi frequency resulting in a reduced effective drive .",

    "the mean cavity photon number ( which is proportional to the cavity mode intensity ) , was also found to change in the presence of phonon - assisted processes which depended sensitively on dot - cavity detuning and the temperature of the phonon bath .    to help explain the underlying physics of electron - phonon scattering in these cavity - qed systems",
    ", we derived an effective phonon me ( epme ) of the lindblad form , which facilitates a very simple numerical solution to the full me and also allows the extraction of various phonon - induced scattering rates in a physically meaningfully way .",
    "in particular , we identified specific phonon - mediated processes which cause eid of the qd exciton resonance and incoherent exciton pumping .",
    "we also identified lindblad superoperators which mediate coherent interactions between the qd and the cavity mode , resulting in exciton - cavity feeding ",
    "a phenomenon that is becoming more familiar in semiconductor cavity - qed ( e.g. , see refs .  ) .",
    "we also studied the regimes of validity of the effective lindblad solution and found that , for relatively large qd - cavity detunings , the effective lindblad solution produces a very good fit to the full polaron me solution .",
    "however , discrepancies can occur for exciton pumped systems with increasing drives , where one requires the full polaron me to obtain a more accurate fwhm of the exciton resonance . using these polaronic me formalisms",
    ", we found that phonon - induced eid and incoherent coupling between the qd and the cavity is fundamental to obtain a complete picture of power broadening in these semiconductor systems .",
    "in particular , our results demonstrate that the cavity emitted qd - driven intensity pl can display quite profound signatures of the phonon spectral bath function .",
    "a cavity driven system also contains clear signatures of the phonon bath , containing power broadened features that are significantly different to those obtained in atomic qed .",
    "we have demonstrated that pure dephasing of the zpl , frequently cited as being responsible for phonon - scattering effects such as cavity feeding , actually only plays a very minor role here ; the physics of the phonon scattering processes that we identity are manifestly different to the physics of coupled lorentzian oscillators , either with or without pure dephasing of the zpl .",
    "the results presented in this paper should be broad interest for interpreting current and future experimental data from semiconductor cavity - qed systems .",
    "a more rigorous analysis would use the full polaron me and a less rigorous approach would use the epme ; the latter approach allows for a simple and intuitive picture of the underlying physics and can be accurate in certain excitation regimes .",

    "<S> we present a quantum optics formalism to study intensity power broadening of a semiconductor quantum dot interacting with an acoustic phonon bath and a high @xmath0 microcavity . </S>",
    "<S> power broadening is investigated using a time - convolutionless master equation in the polaron frame which allows for a nonperturbative treatment of the interaction of the quantum dot with the phonon reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the full non - lorentzian photoluminescence ( pl ) lineshapes and numerically extract the intensity linewidths of the quantum dot exciton and the cavity mode as a function of pump rate and temperature . for increasing field strengths , multiphonon and multiphoton effects </S>",
    "<S> are found to be important , even for phonon bath temperatures as low as 4  k. we show that the interaction of the quantum dot with the phonon reservoir introduces pronounced features in the power broadened pl lineshape , enabling one to observe clear signatures of electron - phonon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the pl lineshapes from cavity pumping and exciton pumping are found to be distinctly different , primarily since the latter is excited through the exciton - phonon reservoir . to help explain the underlying physics of phonon scattering on the power broadened lineshape , an effective phonon lindblad master equation derived from the full time - convolutionless master equation </S>",
    "<S> is introduced ; we identify and calculate distinct lindblad scattering contributions from electron - phonon interactions , including effects such as excitation - induced dephasing , incoherent exciton excitation and exciton - cavity feeding . </S>",
    "<S> our effective phonon master equation is shown to reproduce the full intensity pl and the phonon - coupling effects very well , suggesting that its general lindblad form may find widespread use in semiconductor cavity - qed . </S>"
