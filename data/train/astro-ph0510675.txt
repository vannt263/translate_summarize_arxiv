    "the x - ray transient xte j1739@xmath0302 = = is highly unusual because of its extremely short outbursts .",
    "the only outburst that was monitored over its full extent was found to last less than one day @xcite . in a companion paper ( @xcite ; henceforth ) , we provide full characterization of the x - ray behavior of xte j1739@xmath0302 and evidence suggesting that similarly short durations characterize all its outbursts .",
    "a pointed _ chandra _ observation led to the unambiguous identification of the optical counterpart to xte j1739@xmath0302 .",
    "this star is cataloged as usno - b1.0 05960585865 = 2mass 17391155 - 3020380 , and will be referred to in the following as star a. here we report on extensive optical and infrared observations of this source , a reddened late o - type supergiant .    as discussed in",
    ", the interest of xte j1739@xmath0302 stems from the fact that there seems to be a large number of similar objects , characterized by supergiant donors , low quiescence x - ray luminosities and short ( @xmath2d ) outbursts , which we term supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) .",
    "photometry of star a was obtained on the night of june 27th , 2004 , with the superb seeing imager ( susi-2 ) attached to the 3.5-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) at la silla , chile .",
    "susi-2 was equipped with a mosaic of two @xmath3 eev ccds in @xmath4 binning mode .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath5/pixel .",
    "standard bessell @xmath6 filters were used to observe the field of xte j1739@xmath0302 and several landolt standard fields @xcite , at a range of airmasses .",
    "bias subtraction and flat fielding were carried out on all frames using _ starlink _ ccdpack software @xcite .",
    "then , using the _ starlink _ gaia software @xcite , aperture photometry was performed on all frames with background subtraction from annular sky regions around each star .",
    "instrumental minus catalog magnitudes were calculated for each of the landolt standard stars and linear fits were performed against airmass .",
    "the resulting extinction coefficient , zero point and color term corrections were applied to the target star , resulting in the magnitudes shown in table  [ tab : phot ] .",
    "intermediate - resolution spectroscopy of the source in the red region was obtained with the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) on the ntt during a run in june 2003 .",
    "the red arm was used in the longslit remd mode , equipped with a mosaic of two @xmath7 mit ccd detectors .",
    "on the night of june 6th , we used grating # 6 to observe the @xmath8 range and grating # 7 to observe the @xmath9 range . on june 7th , we only observed xte j1739@xmath0302 with grating # 7 , now centered so as to cover @xmath10 .",
    "image pre - processing was carried out with _ midas _ software , while data reduction was achieved with the _ starlink _ packages ccdpack and @xcite and figaro @xcite .",
    "analysis was carried out using figaro and dipso @xcite .",
    "the blue part of the spectrum was observed on the night of may 21st , 2004 , with the focal reducer / low dispersion spectrograph ( fors1 ) mounted on the 8.2-m vlt / ut1 _ antu _ telescope .",
    "fors1 was equipped with a thinned @xmath11 tektronix ccd and the g600b grism , which covers the @xmath12 range with a nominal dispersion of 1.2 / pixel .",
    "the final spectrum , calibrated by the fors pipeline , was extracted and analyzed with figaro and dipso .",
    "infrared spectroscopy of the counterpart to xte  j1739@xmath0302 was obtained using spex on the infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) on mauna kea on 2003 may 17th . the @xmath13- and @xmath14-band spectra presented in fig .",

    "spex was used in single - order mode with a 0.3 \" slit , giving a dispersion of 5.51   / pix .",
    "unfortunately , the conditions at the irtf were not photometric , but the seeing was excellent .",
    "we employed a script where data at six separate positions along the slit were obtained . to remove the sky background and dark current from each spex exposure",
    ", we subtracted the median of the other five exposures obtained in an observing sequence .",
    "this process resulted in six background - subtracted exposures from which the spectra were extracted using the normal iraf methods .",
    "the spectra were wavelength calibrated by the extraction of an argon arc spectrum at the position ( aperture ) of each spectrum .",
    "we observed the g2v star hd150698 ( in an identical fashion ) to correct for telluric features .",
    "the procedure for the use of g - type dwarfs to correct for the telluric features in near - infrared spectra has been described by @xcite .",
    "g - stars are useful for telluric correction because they have very few strong absorption lines in the near - infrared . but",
    "simple division of a the spectrum of a program object by that of an early g - type dwarf does leave residual features due to absorption and weak metal lines in the g dwarf spectrum . @xcite",

    "the classification spectrum of the optical counterpart to xte j1739@xmath0302 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : blue ] .",
    "the presence of prominent lines identifies it as an o - type star .",
    "the spectral type of o - type stars is determined by the ratio between  4471  and  4541 , which is unity at o7 ( cf . * ? ? ? * for classification criteria ) . the observed ratio indicates an o8 spectral type .",
    "the presence of strong emission and neutralization of  4686are typical of o - type supergiants . however , the counterparts to high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) sometimes display emission lines arising from the vicinity of the compact object .",
    "for instance , , the optical counterpart to cyg x-1 , displays transient  4686  emission and a variable emission component in h@xmath15 which move in antiphase with the photospheric lines @xcite .",
    "star a , however , can be safely classified as a supergiant , based on a large number of characteristics , such as the strong  4486 , 4504  emission lines or very strong  5696emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vband ] ) . moving to absorption features",
    ", the strong  4089 & 4116  absorption lines clearly identify the object as a supergiant .",
    "this classification is corroborated by the @xmath13 and @xmath14-band spectra , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : irspec ] . the sharp and strong brackett lines , as well as",
    "the sharp and prominent  1.700@xmath16 m line clearly identify the star as a supergiant , while the relatively strong lines at 1.693 , 2.1885@xmath16 m confirm that the star is earlier than o9 .",
    "supergiant of stars displaying  4640 in emission also display  2.116@xmath16 m strongly in emission @xcite .",
    "this line is prominent in star a , though br@xmath17 is in absorption .",
    "@xcite show that late of stars may show br@xmath17 in emission or in absorption , while supergiants earlier than o7 always show it in emission .",
    "the supergiant classification is also borne out by the @xmath18-band spectrum , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iband ] . among early - type stars narrow and deep paschen and lines can only be seen in luminous supergiants @xcite .",
    "the exact luminosity class of the optical components of hmxbs is difficult to establish , as the selective emission lines , which are very sensitive to luminosity , may present emission components not originating from the massive star , likely due to a photoionization wake trailing the x - ray source @xcite .",
    "[ fig : alpha ] shows the shape of the h@xmath15 line in star a on the nights of june 6th and 7th , 2003",
    ". the obvious variability on such short timescale would be quite unexpected on an isolated star .",
    "it resembles strongly changes observed in the h@xmath15 line of .",
    "very similar changes are also observed in the optical counterpart to , which is likely also an o8i supergiant @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : blue ] , we compare the spectrum of star a to those of two stars of similar spectral type , taken from the digital atlas of @xcite , the o8iaf supergiant hd  151804 and the o8.5iab(f ) star hd  112244 .",
    "star a appears to be more luminous than hd  112244 , but clearly less luminous than hd  151804 .",
    "the  4686  line needs to be in emission in order for a star to qualify as of . in star",
    "a , it is only neutralized , which corresponds to an ( f ) subscript .",
    "so the object is most likely o8iab(f ) .      for an o8i star , @xcite lists @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the observed @xmath20 implies @xmath21 .",
    "the object is therefore very reddened .",
    "for such high reddenings , the photometric transformations can be subject to errors due to hidden color terms owing to the very different spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the standard stars and the target .",
    "we attempted to correct for this effect by including among the standards some very red stars from landolt s selected area sa  110 .    from our observed colors and the intrinsic colors for an o8i star , we find @xmath22 . this value is higher than the standard @xmath23 , suggesting that the reddening to xte j1739@xmath0302 is not standard . in order to derive a good estimate of the reddening and distance",
    ", we used the @xmath24 code for parameterized modeling and characterization of photometry and spectroscopy implemented by @xcite .",
    "we used as input the sed of a tlusty stellar model with parameters @xmath25k and @xmath26 , roughly corresponding to an o8i supergiant according to the observational calibration of @xcite , our optical photometry and the @xmath27 photometry from 2mass .",
    "the program attempts to fit an extinction law from @xcite to the data . in order to allow for hidden color terms ,",
    "we run the code both with the photometric errors and adding an extra @xmath28mag error to each optical band .",
    "the results were almost indistinguishable .",
    "the best fit is obtained for @xmath29 , @xmath30 . adopting these values",
    ", the code derives a dereddened @xmath31 . for an o8i supergiant ,",
    "@xcite give @xmath32 , which implies @xmath33 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath34kpc . the error in this distance",
    "is most likely to be dominated by the uncertainty in the @xmath35 calibration . for realistic errors of @xmath36mag in the @xmath37 ,",
    "the distance falls in the range @xmath38kpc .",
    "therefore xte  j1739@xmath0302 is certainly much closer than the distance to the galactic bulge .",
    "the reddening to isolated stars can also be estimated from the strength of the diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) in its spectrum .",
    "a good number of prominent dibs are seen in our spectra of star a. however , the relationship between the strength of the interstellar bands and @xmath39 is not well established for values of the reddening as high as seen in star a , mainly because of the scarcity of data points .    according to the recent study by @xcite most bands present a non - linear behavior in this very - high - reddening regime .",
    "we note in pass that the interstellar dibs in the spectrum of star  a are comparable in strength to those of the counterpart to 4u  1907 + 09 , which @xcite claim to be stronger than in any other spectrum observed to date . along the light of sight studied by @xcite , only two interstellar bands ,",
    "those at 5780  and 5797  seem to follow the linear relationship seen at lower reddenings .",
    "we can not use 5797  because , in our spectrum , it appears blended with at least another dib at 5795  and the photospheric  5801 & 5812  lines ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vband ] ) .",
    "this leaves us with the 5780  line as the only trustworthy indicator of interstellar reddening .",
    "applying the calibration of @xcite , we find @xmath40 ( where the error comes mainly from the uncertainty in the equivalent width of the line ) .",
    "this value agrees surprisingly well with the spectrophotometric determination .",
    "until recently , it was widely believed that high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) with supergiant donors were always persistent x - ray sources , while be / x - ray binaries were mostly transients , though some of them were persistent low - luminosity x - ray sources ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "supergiant hmxbs are believed to be powered by direct accretion from the strong radiative wind of the supergiant .",
    "they display typical x - ray luminosities in the @xmath41 range , which are relatively constant over the long run , though presenting strong short - term stochastic variability @xcite .",
    "the behavior of xte  j1739@xmath0302 differs from this pattern in two important respects . on the one hand ,",
    "its quiescent x - ray luminosity is rather lower than this ( @xmath42 ) and the lightcurve shows abrupt `` outbursts '' lasting only several hours . as discussed in , several other x - ray sources display similar short outbursts and have ob supergiants as mass donors .",
    "we have termed this class of objects sfxts .    a third interesting property of xte  j1739@xmath0302 is the fact that the absorption column density derived from the fits to x - ray spectra is not only larger than the expected interstellar absorption , but also highly variable .",
    "the optical extinction to the source @xmath43 transforms to a @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast , the hydrogen column densities measured at different times range from @xmath45 to 38 @xmath46 , clearly suggesting that most of the absorption seen in the x - ray spectra is intrinsic to the source .",
    "similarly variable absorption has been observed in a number of sources recently detected by the _",
    "integral _ satellite .",
    "these objects are generally very absorbed , resulting in very hard x - ray spectra @xcite , which explain the lack of detections by previous missions .",
    "these objects have been dubbed `` obscured _ integral _ sources '' ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "many of these new _ integral _ sources display x - ray pulsations and are hence hmxbs , while several others are also likely to be hmxbs ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , among them some with rather unusual properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "two of the new _ integral _ sources , igr  j17544@xmath02619 and igr  j16465@xmath04507 have already been shown to come within the sfxt category .",
    "however , there does not appear to be a direct correlation between high obscuration and fast outbursts . as a matter of fact , igr  j17544@xmath02619 , which also has as counterpart a late o - type supergiant @xcite , seems to show lower and less variable absorption than xte  j1739@xmath0302 ( cf .",
    "* though this could well be due to the limited number of observations ) .",
    "there is nothing in the optical / ir spectrum of star a that can provide an explanation to its x - ray behavior . in the optical , xte",
    "j1739@xmath0302 is very similar to the wind - fed supergiant system 4u  1907 + 09 @xcite , which has a donor of approximately the same spectral type and is extincted by a similar amount .",
    "4u  1907 + 09 is believed to be at @xmath47kpc and it is so more than one magnitude fainter than star a. the x - ray properties of 4u  1907 + 09 and xte  j1739@xmath0302 are , however , completely different . 4u  1907 + 09 is a persistent x - ray source showing increased emission every @xmath48d , in correspondence with the periastron passage of a neutron star , which is in a relatively eccentric orbit ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "its average x - ray luminosity @xmath50 @xcite is typical of wind - fed hmxbs .",
    "the exact shape of the lightcurve in a wind - fed hmxb depends on many parameters , perhaps most fundamentally on the wind structure ( determined by the evolutionary status of the supergiant ) and the orbital eccentricity .",
    "4u  1907 + 09 and gx  301@xmath02 show strong peaks near periastron , while other systems have smoother lightcurves . but none of the wind - fed hmxb studied in detail so far has properties similar to those of xte  j1739@xmath0302 .    in principle , one could perhaps attribute the very low quiescence luminosity of xte  j1739@xmath0302 to a very wide orbit , but the strong variations in the shape of h@xmath15 between two consecutive nights would support a relatively close interaction , as ( at least one component of ) h@xmath15 should be tracing the vicinity of the compact object . in any case , it seems that the exact meaning of a `` quiescent state '' is difficult to define for xte  j1739@xmath0302 and igr  j17544@xmath02619 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the detection of possible fast outbursts from vela x-1 and cyg x-1 rules out a correlation between low x - ray luminosity and fast outbursts or between a particular type of compact object and fast outbursts , strongly suggesting that the physical mechanism behind the fast outbursts is related to the accretion of material from the wind of a supergiant .",
    "whatever the cause for this behavior , xte  j1739@xmath0302 is the first member of a new class of hmxb to be fully characterized .",
    "the fact that it has only been detected because it happens to be very close to a frequently observed source opens the possibility that a substantial population of similar low x - ray luminosity objects exists .",
