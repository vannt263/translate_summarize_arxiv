    "with the recent discovery of the higgs boson the last missing piece of the standard model ( sm ) has been unveiled and all the parameters of the theory measured .",
    "the success of the standard model in describing all the measured observables at colliders contrasts with the failure of the theory to explain some non - collider observations , such as dark matter , matter - antimatter asymmetry , etc .    among the various completions of the standard model proposed so far ,",
    "supersymmetric ( susy ) theories remain the most attractive option .",
    "not only they screen the electroweak ( ew ) scale from ultraviolet ( uv ) sensitivity to new physics thresholds but they successfully predict the unification of gauge couplings and may provide with a natural wimp dark matter candidate .    on the other hand , indirect hints for a small hierarchy between the scales of electroweak and supersymmetry restoration ( e.g. flavor observables , searches for edms , lep bounds on the higgs mass ) , have found stronger support from the recent discovery of a moderately heavy sm - like higgs @xcite and from the absence of any evidence of superpartners in the first lhc runs at 7 and 8 tev ( see e.g. @xcite ) . while the scale of supersymmetry may still be low ( there are still various arguments in favor of this scenario ) , hopefully within the reach of the next lhc run , it is fair to say that our confidence in predicting the new physics scale based on naturalness arguments weakened substantially @xcite . the suspicion that other mechanisms may explain the strength of the weak interactions is becoming stronger and alternative scenarios to low energy susy already exist @xcite .",
    "it is thus useful to look for different ( more - experimentally - driven ) methods to infer the scale of the superpartners . one natural candidate is the value of the higgs mass , which in supersymmetry is calculable in terms of the couplings and the soft susy breaking parameters .    in particular , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) the tree - level higgs mass is predicted to lie below the @xmath4-boson mass up to quantum corrections logarithmically sensitive to the susy breaking scale .",
    "therefore the measured value of the higgs mass gives non - trivial constraints on the spectrum and couplings of the mssm , allowing to shrink the allowed energy range for the superpartners .",
    "given the logarithmic ( in)sensitivity of the higgs mass value to the susy scale , high precision is required in such calculation to reliably determine the allowed parameter space of the theory . besides , the experimental value is now known with per mille accuracy @xmath5  gev @xcite .",
    "the effort in the higgs mass calculation has been remarkable , reaching the two - loop and in some cases the three - loop level , with different techniques and schemes , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "some of the computations , however , are only valid for small susy breaking scales , where log - corrections do not need resummations ; in fact currently available computer codes have a very limited range of applicability compared to the allowed parameter space .",
    "moreover , different computations and/or computer codes disagree among themselves , in some cases substantially more than the expected / claimed level of uncertainties .    given the important role played by the higgs mass in constraining supersymmetric models , the limitations of the existing codes and the disagreements in the literature , we felt the need to revisit the computation .",
    "we put special emphasis on the relevant parameter space to reproduce the experimental value of the higgs mass , on the study of the uncertainties and on the possible origin of the differences with other methods . in this paper",
    "we recompute the higgs mass in the mssm using the effective field theory ( eft ) approach , which allows to systematically resum large logarithms and to have arbitrary big hierarchies in the spectrum , exploiting the mass gap hinted by the largish value of the higgs mass and the absence of new physics at the lhc .",
    "our computation follows very closely the ones in @xcite , providing independent checks of such computations .",
    "we improved them in various ways .",
    "we added all the dominant susy threshold corrections including the contributions from bottom and tau sectors , which become important at large @xmath0 . in this way we provide the state of the art in the eft calculation of the higgs mass .",
    "we performed the computation in both the @xmath1 and the on - shell ( os ) schemes , the latter has the advantages of ensuring the correct decoupling limits and keeping the theoretical errors under control in the whole parameter space .",
    "we point out that large logarithms arising from splitting the fermions from the scalar superpartners in split susy scenarios do not need resummation in the whole region of parameters space relevant for the observed higgs mass .",
    "we also find that @xmath6  gev may not necessarily bound the susy scale to lie below @xmath7  gev ( and much below at large @xmath0 ) , but it might extend at arbitrarily high scales .",
    "another outcome of our computation is that , even at maximal stop mixing , the average stop mass is required to be above the tev scale in order to reproduce the correct higgs mass in the mssm .",
    "we also performed a study of the various possible uncertainties , showing that for most of the parameter space we are dominated by the experimental ones .",
    "we identified some of the sources of disagreement between existing computations / codes .",
    "we implemented the computation in a new computer code , , which we make public @xcite and which allows to reliably compute the mssm higgs mass ( and its uncertainties ) even when big hierarchies are present in the spectrum . avoiding slow numerical integrations ,",
    "the code is fast enough to be used to set the experimental value of the higgs mass as a constraint on any other susy parameter .",
    "finally we also explore the implications of the higgs mass on two of the simplest susy scenarios : minimal gauge mediation ( mgm ) and anomaly mediation .",
    "in particular in the first case we show how the value of the higgs mass allows to determine the complete spectrum of the superpartners .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : computation ]",
    "we describe our computation of the higgs mass in the effective field theory approach , we study the theoretical uncertainties and we compare our results with the existing ones . in section  [ sec : results ] we present the implications of our computation for the susy spectrum in different regimes , in particular we show the constraints from the higgs mass in the parameter range relevant for susy searches at hadron colliders , we explored the region of very large @xmath0 and we comment on the ( non ) importance of extra log resummation when the susy spectrum is split . in section  [ sec : code ] we briefly introduce , a new code to compute the higgs mass using the eft technique . in section",

    "whenever a theory presents a gap in its energy spectrum effective field theory techniques become a very powerful tool .",
    "they exploit the hierarchy of scales to allow a perturbative expansion in powers of the energy gap .",
    "this simplifies the theory getting rid of irrelevant degrees of freedom and couplings .    applied to supersymmetry , as the scale of the superpartners",
    "is raised , the standard model becomes a better and better eft , with corrections from higher dimensional operators decoupling fast , as powers of @xmath8 , the ratio between the ew and the susy scale . at leading order in this expansion the presence of supersymmetry at low energy reduces to a boundary condition for the sm couplings evolved at the susy scale , where they have to match with the full supersymmetric theory .    from the bottom up the technique reduces to taking the measured sm couplings at low energy , evolving them up to the superpartner scale and matching them to the full supersymmetric theory living at high scales .",
    "the non - trivial relations between the couplings in the supersymmetric theory ( in particular between the higgs quartic , the gauge - yukawa couplings and the soft terms ) translates into a non - trivial condition on the soft susy parameters .",
    "equivalently one can leave the physical higgs mass as a free parameter to be determined as a function of the uv susy parameters . imposing the physical value for the higgs mass then gives the constraint .",
    "the use of this technique in the computation of the higgs mass in the mssm is quite old @xcite , however its utility in natural susy spectra was limited since corrections from higher dimensional operators could not be neglected in that case .",

    "unless specified otherwise , the gauge couplings @xmath9 , the yukawa couplings @xmath10 and the higgs quartic coupling @xmath11 are assumed to be the sm ones in the @xmath12 scheme while the soft parameters ( masses and trilinear couplings ) are in the @xmath1 or os schemes . in particular when we refer to our @xmath1 or os results it means that the soft masses are @xmath1 or os while the couplings are always taken to be the sm ones in the @xmath12 scheme .",
