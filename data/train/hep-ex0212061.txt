    "one of predictions of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is that at high @xmath0 the longitudinally polarized virtual photons @xmath5 fluctuate into hadronic components , e.g. @xmath6 pairs , whose transverse size @xmath7 decreases with @xmath8 , @xmath9 at large @xmath0 the values of @xmath10 are significantly smaller than the size of the nucleon .",
    "_ color transparency _ ( ct ) is a phenomenon of pqcd , whose characteristic feature is that small color - singlet objects interact with hadrons with small cross sections @xcite .",
    "cross section for the interaction of such small object , or small size configuration ( ssc ) , with a hadron target has been calculated in pqcd using the factorization theorem @xcite , as : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gluon distribution function in the nucleon .",
    "observing ct in particular kinematics would prove experimentally the applicability of the pqcd factorization theorem for those kinematics .",
    "such a proof provides important complementary support to a class of spin physics experiments , for example related to measurements of generalized parton distributions at compass @xcite .",
    "the prerequisite for observing ct is to select a sample containing ssc s via a hard process ( i.e. with large @xmath13 , high @xmath14 , or large produced mass ) . for hard exclusive @xmath15 leptoproduction , in addition to large @xmath0 , selection of the longitudinally polarized mesons",
    "is required . to probe the ssc",
    " nucleon cross sections one should study absorption of the ssc propagating through nuclear matter . in order to clearly observe ct",
    "it is necessary that the ssc lives long enough to traverse distances larger than the size of the target nucleus , and that the ssc stays small while propagating through the nucleus .",
    "these requirements are characterized in terms of the coherence length @xmath16 ( the distance traversed by the @xmath6 fluctuation of the virtual photon in the target nucleon / nucleus system ) and by the formation length ( the distance in the target system after a scattering needed for the @xmath6 fluctuation to develop into a hadron ) .",
    "we consider here only exclusive _ coherent _ vector meson @xmath17 production at small @xmath18 .",
    "we analysed the coherent and incoherent channels in refs @xcite . for near - forward ( @xmath19 )",
    "coherent production and complete ct , one expects that the cross section for the nuclear target is related to that for the nucleon target , provided that @xmath20 , by : + @xmath21    usually in experiments the @xmath22-integrated coherent cross section is measured , for which ct predicts an approximate @xmath23 dependence . without ct ,",
    "if a hadron propagates in nuclear matter , the expected @xmath24-dependence is weaker ; @xmath25 for the cross sections comparable to the pion  nucleon cross section .    in searches for ct",
    "a commonly used quantity , measured in experiments , is the _ nuclear transparency _",
    "@xmath26 which is the ratio of the cross section per nucleon for a selected process on a nucleus @xmath24 to the corresponding cross section on a free nucleon .",
    "we concentrate on exclusive coherent vector meson production ( evmp ) , which could be studied at the compass experiment @xcite .",
    "kinematic variables used in this paper are listed in table [ kinvar ] .",
    ".kinematic variables used in the text .",
    "[ kinvar ] [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "we compare compass capabilities to demonstrate ct to those of previous experiments in which exclusive coherent @xmath27 leptoproduction on nuclear targets was studied . for the comparison we must also select experiments which covered @xmath0 range extending to large values , bigger than 2 gev@xmath1 .",
    "the only experiment which published such high @xmath0 exclusive coherent data is the nmc experiment @xcite .",
    "nmc has published data on coherent exclusive @xmath27 production on @xmath28 , c and ca targets .",
    "the muon beam energy was 200 gev and the data cover the ranges @xmath29 and @xmath30 fm . due to the moderate statistics of the data the @xmath0-dependence of nuclear absorption",
    "was not obtained at sufficiently large or at fixed @xmath16 , which is necessary to unambigously demonstrate ct .",
    "the compass data at medium and large @xmath0 ( ft trigger ) will cover the kinematic range similar to that of the nmc data .",
    "the expected statistics for the carbon target will be about 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the nmc data for the same target .",
    "this increase is in particular due to higher beam intensity and larger acceptance in the compass experiment .",
    "in addition compass will use also lead target and will extend measurements to small @xmath0 . due to large statistics splitting of compass data in several @xmath0 and @xmath16 bins as well as the selection of events with longitudinal or transverese @xmath27 polarization will be possible .",
    "we have simulated and analysed exclusive @xmath31 muoproduction at the compass experiment using thin nuclear targets of carbon and lead .",
    "for muon beam energy of 190 gev and a trigger for medium and large @xmath32 , the covered kinematic range is @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "good resolutions in @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath22 ( @xmath37 ) and @xmath38 are feasible .",
    "an efficient selection of coherent events is possible by applying cuts on @xmath37 . in order to obtain the samples of events initiated with a probability of about 80% by either @xmath5 or @xmath39 ,",
    "the cuts on the @xmath31 decay angular distribution of @xmath38 will be used .",
    "the search for ct could be facilitated by using the events with @xmath40 values exceeding the sizes of the target nuclei .",
    "the fraction of such events is substantial and the covered @xmath32 range seems sufficient to observe ct .",
    "we showed high sensitivity of the measured ratio @xmath41 of nuclear transparencies for lead and carbon for different models of nuclear absorption .",
    "good statistical accuracy of the measured @xmath41 may be achieved already for one year of data taking .",
    "these measurements , taken at different @xmath32 intervals , may allow to discriminate between different mechanisms of the interaction of the hadronic components of the virtual photon with the nucleus .    in conclusion ,",
    "the planned comprehensive studies of exclusive vector meson production on different nuclear targets at the compass experiment are able to unambiguously demonstrate ct .",
