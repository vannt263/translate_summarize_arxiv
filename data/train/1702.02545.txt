    "solar energy conversion consists on the production of electrical energy in the form of current and voltage from electromagnetic energy : i.e. , incident light including infrared , visible , and ultraviolet ( uv ) @xcite .",

    "dye sensitized solar cells ( dsscs ) as low - cost solar cell , clean , and renewable energy sources became a practical root for photovoltaic cells when regan and graetzel @xcite , in the late 1980s , have fabricated dsscs composed of a porous layer of titanium dioxide ( tio@xmath4 ) nanoparticles immersed under an electrolyte solution and , covered with a dye molecule that absorbs sunlight .",
    "such a technique expanded the use of semiconductors with wide band gap such as gan , sno@xmath0 , sic , and zno which makes possible the conversion of higher energy photons .",
    "ten years before this invention , a. fujishima and k. honda @xcite discovered the effect of photosensitization of the tio@xmath4 electrode under uv irradiation for the photocatalytic water splitting .",
    "it is well known that interfacial charge recombination is a serious problem for photocatalytic and photovoltaic based devices @xcite .",
    "such a phenomena causes a loss of photo - generated electrons .",
    "it affects the open circuit voltage by decreasing the concentration of electrons in the conduction band of the semiconductor and , also the photo - current by decreasing the forward injection current . from this point of view",
    ", nanostructures , in regard of their large surface to volume ratio , present an inconvenience , i.e. , by increasing the probability of charge recombination .",
    "an attempt to reduce the recombination rate consists of using a bilayer of a metal - oxide semiconductors electrode for high - performance nanomaterial - based dsscs .",
    "one of the proposed systems are core - shell structures , which are derived from the nanoparticles and can reduce the charge recombination by forming a coating layer . an established electric field that may assist the separation of the electrons in the solid - solid interface",
    "can form energy barriers at the electrode - electrolyte interface .",
    "for this reason , several materials have been tested such as sno@xmath0/tio@xmath4 @xcite , sno@xmath0/zno @xcite , tio@xmath4/nb@xmath0o@xmath5 @xcite , zno / al@xmath0o@xmath6 @xcite , and zno / tio@xmath4 @xcite . in the case of zno and tio@xmath7 their similar photovoltaic performances did not come from similarity in properties but from compensating ones @xcite .",

    "they demonstrated that surface diffusion of the zno atoms at elevated annealing temperature can be suppressed and , the efficiency of dsscs was enhanced with more than 30@xmath9 .",
    "the effect of the interface zno / tio@xmath4 was also tested on the performance of polymer solar cells .",
    "it has been found that zno nanorod coated with tio@xmath4 layer demonstrates a significant reduction of the recombination rate and that the tio@xmath4 interface layer functions as an efficient photo - generated exciton quencher and assisted charge collection@xcite .",
    "zno / tio@xmath0 hybrid nanostructures demonstrate also a higher catalytic activity@xcite , where an enhanced charge transfer / separation process with fine interfaces was observed .    understanding the mechanism of zno / tio@xmath4 heterojunction and how the physical characteristics are affected by the solid - solid reaction",

    "our final relaxed double heterostructure is depicted in fig .",

    "if comparing atomic bond lengths in the relaxed system to those in the respective ideal - bulk structure of tio@xmath4 and zno , one may note that these lengths are less distorted in the right interface than those of the left one ( see table [ table.s2 ] ) .",

    "@xcite in which the cbo estimated to be @xmath129 ev for @xmath130 nm thick zno that decreases upon thickness expansion of zno . while measurements on wurtzite zno / rutile - type tio@xmath4 by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) @xcite evaluate vbo ( cbo ) to be @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) ev .",
    "in summary , an extensive study on the nature of the interface between zno ( wurtzite ) and tio@xmath0 ( anatase ) has been presented by means of dft(+u ) simulations .",
    "our structural analysis allowed us to obtain ; an accordance between the atomic planes of the two materials in the tio@xmath37}\\parallel$]zno@xmath38}$ ] interface direction , and a misfit dislocation in the perpendicular direction tio@xmath39}\\parallel$]zno@xmath40}$ ] , in agreement with experimental observations @xcite . using the ground state energy calculations , we found two most stable configurations that have different interface hybridization , from which our double heterostructure tio@xmath0/zno / tio@xmath0 has been constructed .",
    "besides , the non - equivalence of the atomic environment and the presence of more dangling bonds in the left interface makes it less stable than the right one .",
    "the study of the electronic properties at gga+u level shows that valence band is maintained by o@xmath2 orbitals of zno , whereas conduction band arises mainly from @xmath1 orbitals of titanium in which zn@xmath133 were slightly pushed up .",
    "furthermore , by using the double - macroscopic average technique , we evidence an heterojunction type ii but we observed a worthy difference in energy levels between the two interfaces ( left and right ) , resulting in an electron accumulation in the cb of the left shell of tio@xmath0 rather than the right one .",
    "such a double interface system demonstrates an efficient charge separation and increasing of excited electron lifetime , in particular , when tio@xmath0 is used as a shell with a suitable thickness . in practical point of view , despite of the difficulty to experimentally realize such interface orientations , and for the multiple advantages mentioned above , zno / tio@xmath0 heterostructures offer a better possibility of use in photocatalytic and photovoltaic based devices , especially the sandwich structure tio@xmath0/zno / tio@xmath0 .",
