    "the kondo - lattice model ( klm ) has found widespread application as a basic model for the description of itinerant carriers interacting with local magnetic moments formed by inner shells of the constituting atoms .",
    "it was successfully applied in the theoretical description of the europium chalcogenides @xcite , aspects of the physics of manganites @xcite and the diluted magnetic ( iii , mn)v semiconductors @xcite .",
    "it has long been known that the klm , although it forms a complicated many - body problem not solvable in general , has a non - trivial , exactly solvable limiting case - the ( ferro-)magnetic polaron@xcite .",
    "this magnetic polaron is set up by adding one electron into the otherwise empty conduction band and a ferromagnetically saturated background .",
    "shastry and mattis@xcite gave a detailed discussion of the spectral properties of the polaron in terms of the retarded one - electron green s function ( gf ) .",
    "berciu and sawatzky @xcite have extended the gf solution to describe complex lattices and longer ranged exchange interactions .",
    "knowledge of the gf allows for the direct calculation of the bare line shape of a photo emission experiment@xcite via the spectral density ( sd ) .",
    "this strength of the gf approach comes at the expense of getting only indirect information about the underlying eigenstates of the one - electron quantum system .",
    "therefore other approaches have solved schrdinger s equation directly to get this state information@xcite .",
    "sigrist  et .",
    "al.@xcite gave a rigorous proof , that the ground state for a system with antiferromagnetic exchange coupling is of incomplete ferromagnetic order .",
    "we found these derivations to be incomplete in one way or another and there is , to our knowledge , no exhaustive derivation of the eigenstates for the finite system of @xmath0 lattice sites in the literature until now .    in the limit @xmath1 the free dispersion of the electron becomes a continuous function of the wavevector .",
    "it was van hove who pointed out in his seminal papers @xcite that in case of a continuous ( free ) spectrum the interaction part of the hamiltonian can lead to persistent effects not amenable to scattering theory .",
    "this self - energy effects can be of dissipative nature ( finite lifetime of quasi - particles ) and/or cloud effects ( formation of a new quasi - particle with infinite lifetime ) .",
    "both effects are present in the problem of the magnetic polaron .",
    "the phenomenon of decaying states has attracted the interest of many physicists . far from being comprehensive here",
    "we just want to mention the works , that have inspired us to the present investigation .",
    "nakanishi @xcite proposed an extended quantum theory , that contains complex eigenvalues of the hamiltonian which can be associated with an unstable particle . to this aim",
    "he constructed the analytic continuation of the propagator for that particle and found poles in the continuation . by introducing a complex distribution he was able to construct a new eigenstate of the hamiltonian with complex eigenvalue ( equal to the pole position ) leading to an exponential decay of the particle in time .",
    "deviations from an exponential decay law at long times and the importance of the van hove singularity on the lower bound of the spectrum was discussed by hhler@xcite and khalfin@xcite .",

    ". the spectral density of up / down - electrons is discussed in detail .",
    "the complete eigenstates for the finite lattice are derived in section [ sec : eigenstates ] .",
    "section [ sec : thermodynlim ] is devoted to the problems arising in the limit of an infinite lattice .",
    "new ( scattering ) eigenstates are constructed and the time - dependent schrdinger equation is solved for arbitrary initial conditions .",

    "in section [ sec : dod ] a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the quantum system for two different initial conditions is given .",
    "the connection to the scattering states and the limitations of scattering theory are discussed .",
    "finally we give a summary and draw conclusions in section [ sec : sumcon ] .",
    "throughout the paper we are concerned with the s - f - like hamiltonian : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , describing free electrons hopping trough the lattice and undergoing a local ( contact ) interaction with immobile local moments formed by the inner shells of the underlying atoms .",
    "the @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) denote the creation ( annihilation ) operator of an electron with spin @xmath8 at lattice site @xmath9 .",
    "+ the above hamiltonian constitutes a highly involved many - body problem not solvable for the general case .",
    "it has long been known , however , that there exists a non - trivial solution in the limiting case of one electron in the otherwise empty conduction band moving in a lattice of fully ferromagnetically ordered background spins ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "+ the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) does not distinguish energetically between different configurations of the localized spins in case of an empty band .",
    "one could enforce a fully aligned ground state by introducing an additional direct exchange term of heisenberg type between the localized spins as was done in some works @xcite .",
    "this additional term would lead to a true magnon dispersion of the localized moments ( which is flat in our case ) and to energy corrections of the eigenstates where a magnon is present .",
    "since these energy corrections are small ( typical magnon energies are 2 - 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the electronic energies ) and the additional term would complicate the already involved calculations we omit this term and choose the fully aligned state out of the highly degenerate ground - state manifold `` by hand '' .",
    "one has to keep in mind , however , that the dynamics of the localized spins are mediated only by the electron .",
    "+ if not stated otherwise we will use the following model - parameters for the concrete evaluation of our theory .",

    "one expects significant changes in the down - spectral density compared to the mean - field result due to correlation effects .",
    "especially possible spin - flips of the down - electron should result in a finite lifetime of quasi - particles as is indicated by the complex - valued self - energy . inspecting ( [ eq : self_green_down ] ) reveals , that states with finite lifetime can be expected exactly in the energy range of the up - spectrum because the self - energy has a finite imaginary part there .",
    "these states are commonly called the _ scattering states_. in order to fulfill ( [ eq : centerofgrav ] ) for the center of gravity one then should find additional states ( of infinite lifetime ) above ( @xmath24 ) or below ( @xmath25 ) the scattering states as real roots of the denominator of ( [ eq : green_down ] ) at least for sufficiently large @xmath16 .. ] in the next section we will show , that there is exactly one such additional state called the _ bound state _ or _ polaron state_. + to illustrate our findings we have plotted the down - spectral density and the quasi - particle density of states ( qdos ) in fig .",

    "+ when @xmath16 is smaller ( @xmath31 ev , lower figure ) parts of the polaron - band dip into the scattering states .",
    "there is still a visible polaron dispersion in the scattering region , but now in form of a peak with finite linewidth implying a finite lifetime of the quasi - particle .",
    "we will show in a later section ( [ sec : dod ] ) , that each quasi - particle peak in the scattering states is associated with a pole in the suitably analytically continued propagator leading to an exponential contribution in the decay dynamics .",
    "the polaron dispersion is strongly disturbed at the positions of the van hove singularities ( horizontal dashed lines ) of the scattering spectrum .",

    "in this section we derive the complete eigensystem for a finite lattice ( @xmath0 lattice sites ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "although parts of this derivation can be found in the literature @xcite , to our knowledge , the complete spectrum was never calculated .",
