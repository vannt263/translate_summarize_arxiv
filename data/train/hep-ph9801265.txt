    ", the @xmath2-wave scattering amplitudes of longitudinally polarized @xmath3  bosons manifestly violate unitarity beyond a critical energy scale @xmath4  @xcite .    in the minimal standard model ( msm )  @xcite ,",
    "an isodoublet of scalar fields is introduced , leading to a single observable higgs resonance which damps the rise of those scattering amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "however , the running higgs self - coupling  @xmath5 increases with energy and becomes strong at some large scale  @xmath6 which is indicated by a landau pole in the one - loop running coupling constant  @xcite .",
    "this scale depends exponentially on the higgs mass  @xmath7 and approaches the tev range from above for @xmath8 .",
    "low - energy electroweak observables in the fermion / gauge boson sector of the standard model are affected by radiative corrections which depend logarithmically on  @xmath7 . from the high - precision data at lep1 , slc , and the tevatron ,",
    "an upper limit of @xmath9 has been derived at the @xmath10 level  @xcite .",
    "this limit is not sharp : excluding one or two observables from the analysis weakens the bound significantly  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the limit is strictly valid only within the context of the minimal model .",
    "if the higgs mass is as large as several hundred gev , effects from new physics at the strong - interaction scale  @xmath6 could show up at low energies in form of anomalous couplings .",
    "additional degrees of freedom which invalidate the msm calculation could also exist .",
    "thus , a higgs resonance in the range @xmath11 is still a realistic possibility .",
    "future colliders such as the lhc and @xmath12 linear colliders will explore the heavy - higgs mass energy range .",
    "one expects that such a heavy higgs resonance will be found if it exists , and that from a precise analysis of its profile further conclusions on the symmetry - breaking sector of the msm can be drawn . in order to separate anomalous effects",
    ", the predictions from the msm should be known as accurately as possible .",
    "the results of this paper are a step in this direction .",
    "a heavy higgs boson is not a quasi - stable particle that can safely be treated in zero - width approximation .",
    "rather , the width of the higgs resonance will exceed  @xmath13 if @xmath14 . in a gauge theory",
    "the resummation of feynman diagrams for an unstable particle is not uniquely defined within the framework of perturbation theory . for the higgs sector ambiguities arise when different representations of the fields , which nevertheless are simply related by field redefinitions , are compared .",
    "however , amplitudes for longitudinal @xmath3  boson scattering have to satisfy low - energy theorems  @xcite analogous to those satisfied by pion scattering amplitudes in low - energy qcd  @xcite , which in general are violated if the higgs width is introduced in a nave way .    for many practical purposes",
    ", it may be sufficient to overcome these problems by ad - hoc prescriptions .",
    "nevertheless , for a deeper understanding , and if the theoretical predictions are to be used for comparison with experiment , the uncertainties have to be under control .",
    "therefore , we show in the present paper how different descriptions and approximations valid in the low - energy and high - energy ranges and in the resonance region can be combined to yield a unified resummation prescription which is valid within the whole perturbative range .",
    "applying matching and resummation procedures consistently , representation and renormalization - scheme dependence disappears order by order in the perturbative expansion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following two sections we introduce the higgs resonance in the context of goldstone boson scattering and discuss different representations of the higgs and goldstone fields in the lagrangian . in particular , we give a one - parameter formula which interpolates between the linear and non - linear representations . in sec.[sec : reson ] we state the conditions that have to be imposed on the goldstone boson scattering amplitude , and in sec.[sec : resum ] we show how they resolve the apparent ambiguities which arise when the finite width of the higgs boson is taken into account .",
    "the next three sections are devoted to the explicit calculation of the higgs lineshape at leading and next - to - leading order .",
    "finally , we discuss representation dependence and its use for estimating higher - order effects and conclude .",
    "for a quantitative analysis , the higgs lineshape should be calculated within the full msm . the physical picture , however , is clearer if only the leading contributions for high energies and for a large higgs mass are taken into account .",
    "for this reason , we shall discuss the higgs resonance within the framework of the equivalence theorem ( et )  @xcite which relates the unphysical goldstone modes in a @xmath15 gauge to the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the @xmath3 bosons in unitary gauge . in this approximation ,",
    "one consistently neglects terms of order @xmath16 compared to those of order @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "corrections induced by the top quark yukawa coupling are smaller than higgs coupling corrections if @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "we thus neglect them in the present paper , deferring their inclusion to a future publication .",
    "if the yukawa couplings are set to zero , the theory has a global @xmath20 symmetry  @xcite that is spontaneously broken to the diagonal @xmath1 . from this fact one can conclude  @xcite : ( i )",
    "the three goldstone modes can be kept massless consistently to all orders .",
    "( ii ) for all @xmath0 goldstone scattering amplitudes , the dynamical dependence on the mandelstam variables @xmath21 is determined by a single function @xmath22 which is equal to the amplitude for @xmath23 scattering . here",
    "@xmath24 denote the goldstone modes associated with the longitudinally polarized @xmath3 bosons .",
    "( iii ) as @xmath25  goes to zero , the real part of the amplitude @xmath26 vanishes like  @xmath25 , and the imaginary part which arises at one - loop order vanishes like  @xmath27 . in this limit",
    "both terms are determined completely by low - energy quantities , independent of the existence of a higgs resonance .",
    "( iv ) for very high energies , the higgs mass can be neglected , and the theory approaches a massless @xmath28 theory . in this limit",
    "the @xmath20 symmetry is manifest in the scattering diagrams ; it is only slightly broken by the renormalization conditions necessary to match the asymptotic behavior with the low - energy theory , as will be described below .",
    "the lagrangian describing the msm higgs sector in the absence of yukawa and gauge couplings reads @xmath29 }               + \\frac{m^2}{4}{{\\rm tr}\\left[\\sigma^\\dagger\\sigma\\right ] }           - \\frac{m^2}{8v^2}\\left({{\\rm tr}\\left[\\sigma^\\dagger\\sigma\\right]}\\right)^2,\\ ] ] here @xmath30 is a @xmath31 matrix that transforms under @xmath20 as @xmath32 and has a vacuum expectation value @xmath33 .",
    "it may be parameterized in terms of four real scalar fields @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) as @xmath37\\ ] ] where @xmath38 are the pauli matrices . in this parameterization",
    "the symmetry is represented linearly , and renormalizability  _ i.e. _ , the logarithmic high - energy behavior  is manifest .    on the other hand",
    ", a non  linear representation @xmath39 may be preferred for the description of low  energy scattering amplitudes , since the higgs field can be integrated out to leading order by letting @xmath40 , resulting in a non - linear @xmath41  model where the power  like low  energy behavior is manifest .",
    "furthermore , in this representation individual terms can be identified more easily in the full unitary - gauge msm amplitudes , since the derivative couplings in the goldstone interactions correspond to the momentum factors in the longitudinal polarization vectors of massive vector bosons .",
    "the physics derived from a lagrangian , however , is independent of the particular representation chosen for the fields ; it depends only on the number of degrees of freedom , their symmetry properties , and on numerical parameters .",
    "in fact , @xmath2matrix amplitudes  as opposed to off - shell greens functions  are invariant under a wide class of non - linear field transformations , if the independent parameters of the theory are expressed in terms of measurable quantities  @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the fields @xmath42 in terms of @xmath43 , and vice versa , can easily be worked out order by order .",
    "hence , the linear and the non - linear representations yield the same results if _ all _ feynman diagrams to a given order in the perturbative expansion are taken into account .    in order to make representation dependence explicit",
    ", one may introduce a one - parameter family of field representations which includes both representations mentioned above : @xmath44.\\ ] ] here @xmath45 is an arbitrary parameter .",
    "taking @xmath46 , the linear representation  ( [ linear ] ) is reproduced .",
    "the choice @xmath47 corresponds to the non - linear representation  ( [ nonlinear ] ) .",
    "if the feynman rules derived by inserting  ( [ eta - rep ] ) into the lagrangian  ( [ sigma - l ] ) are used to calculate a physical quantity , the parameter  @xmath45 must drop out of the result if all diagrams up to a given order of the expansion parameter chosen are taken into account . in this sense",
    "the parameter  @xmath45 achieves a similar meaning as the gauge parameter  @xmath48 of the electroweak theory .",
    "we will come back to this fact in sec.[sec : eta ] .",
    "at lowest order , the amplitude for @xmath23 scattering is easily calculated as @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "as anticipated , this expression does not depend on  @xmath45 .",
    "it satisfies the requirements mentioned in sec.[sec : theory ] :    * at low energies , it approaches the expression @xmath51 . generally speaking",
    ", the sum of the diagrams in any fixed order @xmath52 of the perturbative expansion vanishes like @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the leading - order low - energy behavior is not modified by higher - order corrections . * at high energies , the amplitude @xmath55 approaches a constant value .",
    "higher - order corrections modify this by adding logarithmic terms of order @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "however , this amplitude can not be used in the resonance region since it diverges at @xmath58 .",
    "resonant diagrams need to be resummed , leading to the introduction of the higgs width which to leading order is given by @xmath59 several approaches to deal with this problem are possible  @xcite .",
    "let us list some of them as they are applied to the leading - order expression  ( [ a - lo ] ) :    1 .   *",
    "@xmath2-matrix approach . *",
    "the higgs pole term is separated with a constant residue , and the correct pole position in the complex plane is inserted .",
    "the remainder , the non - resonant part , is left untouched at this order : @xmath60 the constant width @xmath61 is only introduced for @xmath62 , as indicated by the @xmath63  function . 2 .   *",
    "fixed width in common denominator . *",
    "all terms , including the non - resonant part , are collected into a single fraction before the pole position in the denominator is shifted : @xmath64 3 .",
    "* resummation of self - energies . *",
    "the separation is done by grouping feynman diagrams in two classes : resonant and non - resonant . in the resonant diagrams  ( fig.[fig : dyson ] )",

    "if the @xmath25-dependence is kept , one finds @xmath65 ^ 2}{s - m^2 + im\\gamma(s)\\,\\theta(s ) }      + 2\\lambda\\frac{\\eta^2 s - ( 1-\\eta)^2m^2}{m^2}\\ ] ] where the @xmath25-dependent width is also representation dependent , @xmath66 ^ 2.\\ ] ] 4 .",
    "* kinematical scaling of a constant width @xmath61 . *",
    "the phase space available for the decay of a state with mass @xmath67 into massless particles scales proportional to  @xmath25 . applying this observation to the intermediate higgs state in goldstone scattering , one",
    "is led to @xmath68 where @xmath61 itself is independent of @xmath25 .    _ a priori _ ,",
    "no single approach is preferred . in principle , the inclusion of higher - order corrections can be done as to remove the discrepancies between different formulae . however , the differences can be numerically large at tree - level .",
    "this has been explicitly verified for the analogous problem of the @xmath69 and @xmath70  resonances  @xcite .",
    "[ note that for the @xmath69  resonance , the kinematical - scaling and self - energy resummation schemes , approaches ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , coincide in a linear gauge . ]",
    "considering the higgs resonance , we observe that the expressions @xmath71 to  @xmath72 are not in accordance with the low - energy theorem .",
    "the amplitude  @xmath71 approaches a constant for @xmath73 .",
    "the version  @xmath74 has the correct power behavior , but the normalization is changed to an unphysical complex value .",
    "[ recall that for @xmath54 an imaginary part is allowed only at order  @xmath27 . ]",
    "even worse , the expression @xmath72 depends on  @xmath45 , _ i.e. _ , on the representation chosen for the higgs sector .",
    "by contrast , the expression  @xmath75 which is seemingly introduced by an _",
    "ad hoc _ replacement , satisfies both low - energy and representation - independence requirements .",
    "apparently , the ambiguity in finding a correct resonance description can be removed by the condition that the low - energy theorem should be maintained to all orders .",
    "this additional requirement , which has no counterpart for the @xmath69  resonance , restricts the possible parameterizations of the higgs resonance . as will be demonstrated in the following sections , imposing the low - energy theorem on the amplitude in each order of the perturbative expansion unites the @xmath2-matrix approach with the concept of kinematical scaling .",
    "furthermore , it provides matching conditions which fix the renormalization of the independent parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "a scheme based on the representation - dependent expression  @xmath76 can be set up to give identical results , as shown in sec.[sec : eta ] .",
    "in perturbation theory the property of a feynman diagram to be one - particle reducible or irreducible is not well defined ; it depends on the particular representation chosen for the fields  [ cf.([decomp - eta ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , a resummation of `` resonant '' diagrams is ambiguous in general .",
    "this observation naturally leads to a parameterization of a resonance inspired by @xmath2-matrix theory  @xcite , which we will adopt as a starting point for the treatment of the higgs lineshape .",
    "however , as we have seen in the previous section , for the higgs resonance this approach is not manifestly consistent with the low - energy theorem , if finite - order perturbation theory is applied .",
    "for this reason , we first review the various perturbative expansions and the conditions they have to satisfy . in particular , four energy ranges with different expansion parameters",
    "have to be distinguished :    1 .   the low - energy region ( @xmath77 ) : the amplitude is expanded in powers of @xmath78 . the leading term and the imaginary part of the next - to - leading term",
    "are fixed by the low - energy theorem .",
    "2 .   the perturbative region ( @xmath79 , but excluding the resonance region where @xmath80 ) : the amplitude is expanded in powers of @xmath81 .",
    "3 .   the resonance region ( @xmath82 ) : the distance from the pole is of the order of the width @xmath83 .",
    "any feynman diagram contributing to @xmath23 can be characterized by non - negative integers @xmath52 and @xmath84 to be of the order @xmath85 where @xmath84 counts the number of resonant propagators , and all @xmath25-dependence that is not determined by the pole terms has been absorbed in the @xmath86 piece .",
    "all terms with a fixed @xmath52 are formally of the same order and need to be resummed .",
    "the high - energy region ( @xmath87 ) : neglecting everything that is suppressed by powers of @xmath88 , any term can be assigned non - negative integers @xmath52 and @xmath84 to be of the order @xmath89 all terms with a fixed @xmath52 are formally of the same order and need to be resummed . this can be accomplished by renormalization - group methods , introducing a running coupling and field anomalous dimensions .    in each of these expansions the individual terms are representation - independent : for the perturbative expansion in  @xmath5 , this follows from the general theorems mentioned above . regarding the expansion in powers and logarithms of  @xmath25 , the corresponding pieces can in principle",
    "be identified in a measurement of physical scattering processes .",
    "let us first look at the resonance region .",
    "the full @xmath2-matrix has no multiple poles , but only a simple pole at the complex position @xmath90 .",
    "this defines two real representation - independent constants @xmath91 and @xmath61 , which can be interpreted as the physical mass and physical width of the higgs resonance and @xmath61 from the corresponding feynman amplitudes can be technically quite involved at higher orders . ]",
    "@xcite . from re - expanding the complex pole around @xmath58",
    "we recover the expansion  ( [ res - representation ] ) , and we observe that resonant terms , _",
    "i.e. _ those with order @xmath92 , can be summed up into @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "this is the usual dyson series . assuming that any field - strength renormalization of the external goldstone particles is included in the amplitude @xmath95 , the relation  ( [ dyson - res ] ) defines two more real observable quantities @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "if the definition of the expansion parameter  @xmath5 is given in terms of physical observables , the constants @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 have perturbative expansions that are independent of the representation and of any intermediate renormalization scheme order by order .",
    "the remaining part of the full amplitude @xmath95 can be collected in a function @xmath99 which we may call the non - resonant piece .",
    "the result for the total amplitude is @xmath100 with these definitions the function  @xmath99 also has a perturbation expansion in which each term is representation- and scheme - independent separately , and its higher - order terms scale like @xmath101 in the low - energy limit .    in a real calculation",
    "the quantities @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 can be computed only to finite order .",
    "it is this truncation which spoils the low - energy theorem , as we have observed in the lowest - order example of the preceding section .",
    "however , we are free to rewrite the exact expression  ( [ dyson ] ) in such a way that the correct low - energy behavior is preserved even for the truncated series . to this end , we evaluate  ( [ dyson ] ) for @xmath102 : @xmath103 thus , the modified function @xmath104 vanishes like @xmath25 for @xmath54 .",
    "it remains to introduce the piece  ( [ a - hat ] ) in the complete expression  ( [ dyson ] ) . rewriting  ( [ dyson ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath105 to all orders .",
    "[ recall that @xmath106 with a constant width  @xmath61 . ]    by extracting the factor  @xmath107 in the numerator , we have effectively introduced a kinematical scaling proportionaly to  @xmath25 of the constant higgs width in the denominator .",
    "when the result is re - expanded in the low - energy region , the imaginary part of the denominator enters only at order  @xmath27 , allowing the imaginary parts of the first and second term to cancel up to order  @xmath25 at each order in the loop expansion .",
    "this is necessary to satisfy the low - energy theorem order by order . as we shall see later ,",
    "the _ real _ part of the order-@xmath25 term is divergent ; here the low - energy theorem serves as a matching condition @xmath108 which can be employed to define the renormalized coupling  @xmath5 in terms of @xmath91 and the low - energy quantity @xmath109 .",
    "it is easily verified that the result  ( [ impdyson ] ) is correct in the other energy ranges : at @xmath58 , terms have been shifted between the resonant and the non - resonant piece .",
    "however , if the width is calculated to order @xmath52 , one has to calculate @xmath110 only up to order @xmath111 to ensure that the normalization of the peak amplitude is unchanged .",
    "for @xmath112 the resonant part in  ( [ dyson ] ) vanishes like @xmath113 , and only @xmath99 is of importance . in  ( [ impdyson ] )",
    "both parts contribute for @xmath114 .",
    "however , since there is no cancellation required , this fact is irrelevant .",
    "we have not yet considered the resummation of logarithms in the high - energy limit . for @xmath87",
    ", the theory eventually approaches a massless @xmath28 model .",

    "in the previous sections we have been careful to work only with representation - independent quantities . in a practical calculation it may be useful to take the feynman rules derived from  ( [ sigma - l ] , [ eta - rep ] ) , and use the fact that the parameter  @xmath45 drops out of all physical results as a check of the calculation .",
    "however , it is also instructive to look at representation dependence from a different viewpoint :    as mentioned in the introduction , in the non - linear representation ( @xmath47 ) the power - like low - energy behavior is manifest in each individual feynman diagram . by contrast , at high energies the complete amplitude rises logarithmically ; for individual diagrams this applies only in the linear representation ( @xmath176 ) . in both representations",
    "the respective opposite limit is also reproduced correctly , but it requires large cancellations between different feynman diagrams .",
    "these cancellations would be spoiled by a nave introduction of the higgs boson width .",
    "therefore , instead of rearranging the perturbation series in the way described in the preceding sections , one is tempted to interpolate the two representations by introducing an @xmath25-dependent @xmath45  parameter . of course , this makes no sense in the lagrangian , but in a scattering amplitude @xmath25 is an external parameter , and since the full amplitude is independent of @xmath45 , this manipulation can only affect higher - order terms which are not yet included in the perturbative result .",
    "a natural choice is @xmath196 which has the appropriate limits @xmath197 not surprisingly , this exactly reproduces  ( [ seymour ] ) when inserted into  ( [ decomp - eta ] ) with  ( [ gamma(eta ) ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to extend this trick to higher orders . if working to order @xmath52 , all diagrams with @xmath84 resonant higgs propagators and @xmath198 loops should be evaluated in the general representation  ( [ eta - rep ] ) and resummed .",
    "this requires computation of the same set of one - particle irreducible diagrams that are needed in the scheme described before .",
    "if the result is re - expanded in powers of  @xmath5 , the @xmath45-dependence disappears up to order  @xmath52 .",
    "however , the full expression is representation - dependent .",
    "it seems reasonable that by making @xmath45 a function of @xmath25 , the complete expression fulfils all requirements in the various energy ranges if the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath199 in addition , the condition @xmath200 enforces to leading order the kinematical phase space scaling @xmath201 on the resonance peak .    in this way ,",
    "a valid formula for the resonance peak can be obtained from a direct resummation of self - energies .",
    "the disadvantage is that the parameter  @xmath45 must be kept in the calculation .",
    "however , by comparing the result for different ( reasonable ) functions @xmath202 that satisfy the above conditions , the residual representation dependence from higher orders can be quantified , and the theoretical uncertainty in the description of the higgs line shape be estimated .",
    "the increase of the running higgs self - coupling limits the use of perturbation theory to energies below the landau pole which arises at one - loop order in the high - energy limit .",
    "however , within the perturbative region the procedure described in the present paper is sufficient for a consistent treatment of the higgs resonance in the goldstone - boson approximation : the physical higgs mass  @xmath91 is defined as the real part of the pole position .",
    "the other free parameter , the coupling constant  @xmath5 , is fixed by imposing the low - energy theorem which is a consequence of the custodial @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "this matching condition restricts possible parameterizations of the higgs resonance and determines the proper inclusion of the higgs width .",
    "the resummation of logarithms in the high - energy region can be performed in a massless theory , and the result can be added to the amplitude derived in the massive theory in such a way that double - counting is avoided .",
    "the massless theory has one free parameter which is determined by a matching condition at a scale @xmath128 .",
    "the final formula  ( [ amp - full ] ) describes the higgs resonance for all energies , and has been evaluated explicitly to leading ( lo ) and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in  ( [ a0-full ] ) and  ( [ a1-full ] ) , respectively .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig : lineshape ] for a higgs mass @xmath203 . at low energies ,",
    "the lo and nlo curves are virtually indistinguishable : the lo formula  ( [ a0-full ] ) already reproduces the one - loop imaginary part exactly in this limit . beyond the resonance , the lo result rises rapidly towards the landau pole , whereas the nlo curve stays at moderate values of the amplitude .",
    "the transition to the high - energy region at the matching point @xmath204 [ cf.([improved - mu0 ] ) ] is sharp in lo , but smooth in nlo .    to verify that our parameterization is in accordance with unitarity requirements , in fig.[fig : uni ] we plot the deviation of the partial - wave eigenamplitude @xmath126  @xcite from the unitarity circle , the latter given by @xmath205 .",
    "here elastic unitarity is respected for the formulae  ( [ a0-full ] ) and  ( [ a1-full ] ) almost perfectly up to @xmath206 , and approximately up to energies as high as @xmath207 . by contrast , in nlo a fixed - width formula as it directly follows from @xmath2-matrix theory ( [ dyson ] ) misses this requirement both at low energies and in the resonance region , although it is formally equivalent to our result  ( [ amp - full ] ) if all orders are included .",
    "[ note that higher - order terms will restore unitarity in any scheme which is consistent in perturbation theory . ]",
    "the extension to higher orders is straightforward .",
    "two - loop corrections to the goldstone scattering amplitude and higher - order renormalization group coefficients have been calculated in  @xcite .    at low energies the transversal degrees of freedom of the gauge bosons are important , and",
    "the gauge couplings and vector boson masses can not be neglected .",
    "although results for physical processes can be obtained from the goldstone - boson approximation by means of the effective  @xmath70 approximation , for numerically reliable predictions the results of this paper have to be embedded in a full standard - model calculation .",
    "in particular , qed bremsstrahlung corrections affect the lineshape and should be included in conjunction with the process - dependent one - loop corrections in the electroweak standard model  @xcite",
    ". this problem will be approached in a future publication .",
    "if a heavy higgs resonance has been chosen by nature for breaking the electroweak symmetry , it is mandatory to have complete theoretical control over the lineshape in order to separate effects which could indicate physics beyond the minimal model .",
