    "in a previous paper@xcite we developed a formal approach , for the description of the relativistic dynamics , which lead to what we called _ gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effect_. this approach is based on the description of the standard relative dynamics in the context of the _ natural splitting _ , introduced by cattaneo and subsequently developed by himself , ferrarese and collaborators .",
    "the formulation that we gave of the gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effect holds in exact theory , and it generalizes some old results obtained at first order approximation@xcite . in the previous paper we used this approach to calculate the sagnac time delay , for matter or light beams counter - propagating in a rotating reference frame in flat space - time . in doing so",
    ", we exploited the formal analogy between matter ( or light ) beams counter propagating in circular trajectories in gravitational or inertial fields , and charged beams propagating in a region where a magnetic potential is present . here",
    "we apply the formalism of the gravito - magnetic aharononv - bohm effect for studying the sagnac effect in curved space - time .",
    "tartaglia@xcite studied the general relativistic corrections to the sagnac effect in kerr space - time , while an approach similar to ours , i.e. based on a gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effect , was developed by cohen and mashhoon@xcite , who studied the gravito - magnetic time delay in the weak gravitational field of a rotating source , at first order approximation .",
    "our formalism allows to generalize these results to arbitrary stationary and axially symmetric geometries , in full theory without any approximations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : gem_desc ] we recall the main features of the gravito - magnetic description of dynamics , in sections [ sec : ab ] and [ sec : gem_ab ] we illustrate , respectively , the aharonov - bohm effect and the gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effect . in section [ sec : sagnac ] we study the sagnac effect in flat and curved space - time .",
    "by applying cattaneo s splitting , the dynamics of massive or massless particles , relative to a given time - like congruence @xmath0 of unit vectors @xmath1 , can be described in terms of a `` gravito - electromagnetic '' analogy . here",
    "we briefly review the main features of this approach , in order to formulate , in the following sections , the gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "the details of the calculations may be found in @xcite .",
    "the congruence @xmath0 defines the physical reference frame with respect to which the particles move , and an observer at rest on this physical frame has a world - line which coincides with one of the world - lines of the congruence .",
    "let @xmath2 be the components of the unit vectors field @xmath1 in coordinates adapted to the congruence .. ] their expression in terms of the metric tensor @xmath3 is @xmath4    then , if we introduce the _ gravito - electric potential _ @xmath5 and the _ gravito - magnetic potential _",
    "@xmath6 , defined by    @xmath7    we can write the _ gravito - magnetic field _    @xmath8    and the _ gravito - electric field _ : @xmath9    in analogy with the definitions of classical electromagnetism .",

    "this description has been obtained without any approximations , consequently it applies to arbitrary congruences , in both flat and curved space - time . of course , if one performs a first order approximation , the gravito - electromagnetic analogy that we have obtained corresponds to the well known gravito - electromagnetic description of the weak field approximation of general relativity ( see for instance @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .    if the particles are not free , but are acted upon by an external force field @xmath46 , eq .",

    "for instance , the constraints that force a particle to move along a circular path ( or guide ) are external fields : this is what happens to beams of particles that propagate in a rotating ring interferometer , which is the typical situation of the sagnac effect .",
    "we recall here that the gravito - magnetic effects are related to the rotational features of the congruence we deal with .",

    "the phase of the two wave functions , at each point of the pattern , is modified , with respect to the case of free propagation ( @xmath66 ) , by the magnetic potential .",
    "the magnetic potential - induced phase shift has the form@xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the oriented closed curve , obtained as the sum of the oriented paths @xmath69 and @xmath70 relative to each component of the beam .",
    "( [ eq : ab ] ) expresses ( by means of stoke s theorem ) the phase difference in terms of the flux of the magnetic field across the surface @xmath71 enclosed by the curve @xmath68 .",
    "aharonov and bohm@xcite applied this result to the situation in which the two split beams pass one on each side of a solenoid inserted between the paths .",
    "thus , even if the magnetic field @xmath63 is totally contained within the solenoid and the beams pass through a @xmath72 region , a resulting phase shift appears , since a non null magnetic flux is associated to every closed path which encloses the solenoid .",
    "tourrenc@xcite showed that no explicit wave equation is demanded to describe the aharonov - bohm effect , since its interpretation is a pure geometric one : in fact eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab ] ) is independent of the physical nature of the interfering charged beams , which can be spinorial , vectorial or tensorial .",
    "so , if we deal with relativistic charged beams , their propagation is described by a relativistic wave equation , such as the dirac equation or the klein - gordon equation , depending on the nature of the beams themselves . from a physical viewpoint",
    ", spin has no influence on the aharonov - bohm effect because there is no coupling with the magnetic field which is confined inside the solenoid .",
    "moreover , if the magnetic field is null , the dirac equation is equivalent to the klein - gordon equation , and this is the case of a constant potential . as far as we are concerned , since in what follows we neglect spin , we shall just use eq .",
    "( [ eq : ab ] ) and we shall not explicitly refer to any relativistic wave equation .",
    "indeed , things are different when a particle with spin , moving in a rotating frame or around a rotating mass , is considered . in this case a coupling between the spin and the angular velocity of the frame or the angular momentum of the rotating mass appears ( this effect is evaluated by hehl - ni@xcite , mashhoon@xcite and papini@xcite ) .",
    "hence , the formal analogy leading to the formulation of the gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effect , which is outlined in the following section , holds only when the spin - rotation coupling is neglected .",
    "in this section , on the basis of the gravito - electromagnetic description of the relativistic dynamics that we recalled before , we introduce the _ gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effect_. this enables us to outline an analogy between matter ( or light ) beams , counter - propagating around circular orbits , in stationary and axially symmetric geometries , and charged beams , propagating in a region where a magnetic potential is present . + in eq .",
    "( [ eq : motogenf ] ) the general form of the equation of motion , relative to a congruence @xmath0 , is given in terms of the gravito - electric field @xmath73 , the gravito - magnetic field @xmath74 and the external fields .",
    "in particular , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : motogenf ] ) a gravito - magnetic lorentz force appears @xmath75    by following the analogy between the magnetic and gravito - magnetic field , we want to study the phase shift induced by the gravito - magnetic field on beams of matter or light particles which , after being coherently split , make a complete round trip , in opposite directions , along a circumference .",
    "the analogue of the phase shift ( [ eq : ab ] ) for the gravito - magnetic field turns out to be @xmath76 where @xmath37 refers to the standard relative mass or standard relative energy of the particles of the beams ( see section [ sec : gem_desc ] ) .",
    "the phase shift ( [ eq : gab ] ) has been obtained on the basis of the formal analogy between eq .",
    "( [ eq : genlorentz11 ] ) and the magnetic force : @xmath77 by means of the substitution @xmath78 we recall here that in order to have a gravito - magnetic field , the geometry of the congruence @xmath0 has to be stationary : hence a gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effect arises in stationary geometries .    as we said before",
    ", the standard relative time is the proper time for an observer or a measuring device at rest in the congruence @xmath0 , which constitutes the reference frame with respect to which the beams propagate .",
    "consequently , the proper time difference corresponding to ( [ eq : gab ] ) is obtained according to    @xmath79    and it turns out to be @xmath80    we want to point out that both ( [ eq : gab ] ) and ( [ eq : deltatau1 ] ) have been obtained taking into account the hypothesis that the two beams ( particles ) have the same velocity ( in absolute value ) relative to the reference frame defined by the congruence @xmath0 . in particular ,",
    "if we refer to a rotating frame in flat space - time , this hypothesis coincides with the condition of `` equal velocities in opposite directions '' that we imposed in order to obtain the sagnac effect by using a direct approach@xcite .    as we shall see below , the time delay ( [ eq : deltatau1 ] ) corresponds to the sagnac time - delay : hence , eq . ( [ eq : deltatau1 ] ) clearly evidences the `` universal '' character of the time delay sagnac effect , since the mass ( or more correctly , the energy ) of the particles of the interfering beams does not appear .",
    "so , the sagnac effect turns out to be an effect of the geometry of space - time , and it can be considered universal , in the sense that it is the same , independently of the physical nature of the interfering beams .",

    "it is well known that when observing the interference between light or matter beams ( such as light beams , electron or neutron beams and so on ) counter - propagating in flat space - time along a closed path in a rotating interferometer a fringe shift @xmath81 arises .",
    "this phase shift can be interpreted as a time difference between the propagation times ( as measured by a clock at rest on the rotating interferometer ) of the co - rotating and counter - rotating beam . in @xcite we already showed that the sagnac effect , for both matter and light beams , counter - propagating in a interferometer rotating in flat space - time , may be obtained by following a formal analogy with the aharonov - bohm effect : in a sense , it might be thought of as a gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effect . however",
    ", this procedure can be generalized to study the sagnac effect in curved space - time , in order to obtain the general relativistic corrections .",
    "in other words , we can study the interference process of matter or light beams in a rotating frame in curved space - time in terms of gravito - magnetic aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "this corresponds to calculating the phase shift ( [ eq : gab ] ) and the time difference ( [ eq : deltatau1 ] ) as measured , respectively , by a uniformly rotating interferometer and by an observer , provided with a standard clock .",
    "the time difference corresponds to the delay between the propagation time of the co - propagating and counter - propagating beam ( see figure [ fig : sphere ] ) . in what follows ,",
    "the two beams are supposed to have the same velocity ( in absolute value ) with respect to the rotating frame .    for studying the sagnac effect in stationary and axially symmetric geometries ,",
    "it is sufficient to express the space - time metric in coordinates adapted to a congruence of rotating observers . generally speaking the metrics we deal with",
    "are given in coordinates adapted to a congruence of asymptotically inertial observers ; if the coordinates are spherical , the passage to a congruence of observers uniformly rotating in the equatorial plane is obtained by applying the ( azimuthal ) coordinate transformation : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the ( constant ) angular velocity .",
    "+ then , it is simple to apply the formalism that we have described so far .",
    "the following steps give a prescription for calculating the sagnac effect in arbitrary stationary and axially symmetric geometries in both flat and curved space - times .",

    "we consider beams counter propagating around the source of gravitational field , in its equatorial plane , along circular orbits of radius @xmath87 .",
    "the flat space - time metric , in cylindrical coordinates has the form : @xmath88 by performing an azimuthal transformation @xmath89 we get @xmath90    then , the non null components of the vector field @xmath91 , evaluated along the trajectories @xmath92 are @xmath93 where @xmath94 . as to the gravito - magnetic potential",
    ", we have @xmath95    consequently , the phase shift ( [ eq : gab ] ) becomes @xmath96 and the proper time difference is    @xmath97    eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltatau ] ) agrees with the well known sagnac time delay ( see for instance@xcite ) .",
