    "however , for the configuration of one channel occupied only in the constriction and two channels occupied in the segment with soi , the spin - polarization reaches up to @xmath2 .",

    "the conductance spin polarizations on different strength of rashba soi are shown in fig .",
    "[ polar3 ] .    in order to understand a critical role of the constriction for the appearance of a higher spin polarization in this system configuration .",

    ". actually , the intermixing among these four states plays the main role in achieving a large polarization . for @xmath182 ,",
    "the form of the perturbed wavefunctions indicates that the distortion of @xmath183 and @xmath139 from @xmath184 and @xmath185 is greater than that of @xmath131 and @xmath186 from @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , the state @xmath187 is more likely to be scattered into the state @xmath131 than the state @xmath189 to be scattered into @xmath183 .",
    "the probability of @xmath187 being scattered into the state @xmath186 is smaller than that of @xmath190 into @xmath139 .",
    "namely , @xmath191 is larger than @xmath192 and @xmath165 is larger than @xmath193 .",
    "the term @xmath177 is positive .",
    "however , if there is no the constriction to confine the electron to the lowest channel , the incident electron can occupy two channels in the left semi - infinite wire . according to the above analysis ,",
    "the lowest channel ( the states @xmath194 and @xmath190 ) gives a positive contribution to @xmath177 , but the second channel ( the states @xmath195 and @xmath196 ) will give a negative contribution to @xmath177 .",
    "therefore , the polarization is reduced due to the contributions of two channels being cancelled partially .",
    "besides , when two channels are occupied by incident electrons , the interference term @xmath178 will be also reduced . for the case without the constriction , the polarization is plotted in fig . [ polar2 ] .",
    "it is shown that the polarization is small and nonzero only when the right lead supplies at least two channels@xcite . however , the polarization would be enhanced if there is a constriction which supplies one channel in the region of constriction and two channels in the soi segment(four subbands if spin indexes are counted ) .",
    "the simplest structure is the width of constriction to be half of the width of wire @xmath197 .",
    "since the above discussion is for @xmath182 , i.e. , for right - going electrons , the main contribution to @xmath173 comes from the interference between states @xmath183 and @xmath139 .",
    "( [ pi ] ) shows that this interference oscillates with the longitudinal length in @xmath5 .",
    "the period of the oscillation is @xmath198 .",
    "the oscillation of the polarization @xmath199 along with the length of the soi segment is plotted in fig .",
    "length(a ) . in the numerical calculations the fermi wave vector",
    "is taken @xmath200 , so we have @xmath201 and @xmath202 . therefore , the period of the oscillation is @xmath203 .",
    "the structure of the oscillation with other periods is caused by the interference between @xmath131 and @xmath186 , and the reflection amplitudes from the right interface of the soi segment , which can be seen in the fourier spectrum fig .",
    "length(b ) . for different lengths of the soi wire , the conductance spin polarizations as functions of fermi wave vector",
    "have been shown in fig .",
    "[ length2 ] .",
    "the numerical results show that the polarization is sensitive to the length of the soi segment .",
    "especially , when @xmath204 , the large spin polarization may be kept over a wide range of incident energy .",
    "the above calculations show the effect of the length of soi segment on the spin polarization .",
    "the width of soi segment is influential in the generation of higher spin polarization .",
    "let us look at the dimensionless form of hamiltonian first , the dimensionless coefficient of soi takes the form as @xmath205 and the energy takes the form as @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the width of the wire . from these",
    "we see that the dimensionless values of the soi strength and the energy are proportional to @xmath207 and @xmath208 , respectively . in the dimensionless formalism , the transport of an electron with energy @xmath30 through a quantum wire of width @xmath6 with the soi strength @xmath209 is entirely equivalent with that of an electron with energy @xmath210 through a wire of width @xmath211 with the soi strength @xmath212 , where @xmath213 is an arbitrary real number .",
    "if the soi segment is widened ( @xmath214 ) from the width @xmath6 to @xmath211 and and the energy of indicant electrons is decreased from @xmath30 to @xmath210 , but the soi strength @xmath209 is retained unchanged , the only change is the dimensionless soi strength is increased from @xmath13 to @xmath215 in the dimensionless formalism . in another word , when we widen the wire from @xmath6 to @xmath211 , keeping the soi strength unchanged is equivalent to heighten the dimensionless soi strength @xmath216 times if the energy of indicant electrons is reduced to @xmath217 so that the dimensionless energy does not change .",
    "the net effect is to augment the soi in the region of segment and leads to enhance the spin polarization .",
    "this effect can be understood qualitatively in another way . as known that the spaces between the discrete energy levels become small when the width of the wire increases , so that the contribution from the soi is increased .",
    "then , the sub - band mixing becomes stronger .",
    "if we decrease the energy of incident electrons correspondingly so that scattering from one - channel to two - channel is retained , the higher polarization is generated .",
    "although the sharp boundary conditions in the geometry of system configuration and in the strength of soi have been considered in our calculations , both the effect of spin filtering and its enhancement should be robust and not sensitive to the specific choice of boundary condition if only a constriction and a soi segment are presented . to be compared",
    "we smooth the boundary by adding two short segments with sequently increasing widthes and soi strengths between the constriction and the soi segment .",
    "the numerical results provide the evidences that the amplitude of the spin polarization is almost unchanged ( see fig .",
    "[ polar1](c ) ) .",
    "only change is the resonant structure .",
    "the boundary for the wire only decides the resonant structure of the conductance spin polarization , which could be seen in our perturbative analysis , but not reduce the spin - filtering effect significantly .",
    "in essence , the spin polarization arises from the distortion of the transverse wavefunction of the soi segment @xmath218 from the wavefunction of the wire without soi @xmath219 due to the sub - band mixing .",
    "the enhancement of the spin - filtering is less dependent of the boundary .",
    "the alpha - squared scaling for the strength of spin filtering does remain even in cases with gradual changed boundaries .",
    "differing an width uniform wire in the presence of a soi section , in which the contributions of the lowest two incoming channels to the polarization of the transmitted current always cancel each other partially , it is evident that the interference and the scattering in the present configuration , due to the configuration of a constriction confining the incident electrons to occupy one channel only while the outgoing electrons occupy two channels , increase the spin polarization significantly .",
    "in summary , we have investigated numerically the spin - filtering in a quantum wire with a constriction and a soi segment .",
    "the results show a higher conductance spin polarization generated in the transverse direction in comparison to configuration without the constriction . the spin polarization has been analyzed with the scattering processes and the perturbation theory .",
    "it is found that the enhancement is mainly due to the presence of a constriction which confines the incident electrons to occupy only one channel .",
    "the significant spin - filtering occurs when the constriction supplies one channel and the soi wire supplies two channels .",
    "the spin - filtering mainly arises from the scattering between the constriction and the soi segment .",
    "the sub - band mixing effect and the interference of different spin - states induced by the soi segment dominate the spin - filtering effect in the scattering process .",
    "in addition , in contrast to that the polarization is in the third order of @xmath13 for a uniform wire , the induced conductance spin polarization in present system configuration is in the second order of @xmath13 .",
    "the predication of a higher spin - filtering effect in present configuration is able to be observed experimentally .",
    "the studies have been extended to the case of gradual change in space between the constriction and the soi segment .",
    "it is shown that a higher spin - filtering occurs also if only the constriction supplies one channel and the soi wire supplies two channels .",
    "although the present paper only consider the rashba soi , the significant effect of spin - filtering in the longitudinal direction instead of in the transverse direction can be retained if the linear dresselhaus soi is utilized instead of the rashba soi .",
    "however , the spin - filtering will be reduced if both rashba and dresselhaus soi are presented .",
    "the spin - filtering vanishes if two kinds of soi have the same strength .",
    "the reason is that the dispersion relation becomes rigorously parabolic again and the sub - band mixing disappears .",
