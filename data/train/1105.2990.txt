    "precise interferometric measurement plays a key role in many scientific and technological applications , such as quantum metrology , imaging , sensing and information processing @xcite .",
    "the fundamental sensitivity bounds of phase measurement in the mach - zehnder interferometer ( mzi ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1a ] , are of broad interest for those areas . for @xmath1",
    "identical uncorrelated particles , the error about the phase measured in mzi on the average decreases as @xmath2 which is the shot - noise limit ( snl ) . in 1980s , it was pointed out that by using coherent light together with squeezed vacuum we could beat snl @xcite .",
    "it is also shown that using noon state @xcite and quantum entanglement allows interferometric sensitivity that also surpasses this limit . instead of snl ,",
    "the ultimate limit imposed by quantum mechanics is the heisenberg limit ( hl ) with a generally accepted form @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "experiments exploring those topics have been performed in various systems with photons @xcite , ions @xcite , cold - atoms @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite",
    ". however , it seems to be indicated in some works that the hl with form @xmath3 could be violated while the experiments are performed with a fluctuating number of particles @xcite .",
    "then , hl for an unfixed number of particles has become a focus of great attention as well as contention in all the parameter estimation schemes .    in this letter",
    ", we investigate the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) in two kinds of two - path interferometers for a fluctuating number of photons since the well - known cramr - rao bound ( crb ) whose leading role is played by qfi is often used to estimate sensitivity of phase measurement . to achieve the maximum qfi and the lowest crb , we should use the optimal states , and implement the optimal measurements ( optimal povm ) .",
    "we investigate the measurement applied in two kinds of linear two - path interferometers , as shown in fig .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ f1a ] is for mzi , and fig .",
    "[ f1b ] is a modified mach - zehnder interferometer ( mmzi ) where the first beam - splitter is replaced by an entangled photon source .",
    "we show that the optimal measurement scheme can be expressed by a group of compatible observables .",
    "we confirm that the maximum qfi for a definite photon number probability distribution , written as @xmath0 , is saturated with a superposition of noon states in mmzi .",
    "in particular , we present a superposition of noon states with a specified probability distribution and a finite average photon number .",
    "we find that qfi for this state can be infinite , i.e. an arbitrary high phase sensitivity is obtained by cramr - rao inequality while it still has a finite average photon number .",
    "apparently , this phase sensitivity does not violate heisenberg uncertainty relation , but seems to break hl .",
    "nevertheless , crb is only asymptotically tight for infinitely many trials of measurements under the unbiased estimate assumption @xcite , and it includes no prior information of the phase probability distribution @xcite .",
    "therefore , hl can merely be violated under some very special situation , for example the phase is in a restricted neighborhood near zero as the case of distinguishing states , and the limit obtained by crb is of little use when we consider the resources required for the prior information of the problem @xcite .",
    "similar theoretical results based on the quantum speed limit @xcite are also obtained in ref .",
    "although crb can sometimes grossly underestimate the achievable error , qfi and crb are still of great use for many applications in quantum techniques such as parameter estimation for noisy systems @xcite , limits of imaging @xcite , distinguishability of states @xcite and quantum zeno effect @xcite .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] , we demonstrate the optimal measurement scheme by simultaneous measurements in linear two - path interferometers . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , we obtain the maximum qfi in the optimal measurement scheme . in sec",
    ".  [ iv ] , we discuss the measurement scheme written as one operator . in sec .",
    "[ v ] , we present a superposition of noon states with infinite qfi and finite average photon number .",
    "superpositions of noon states in mmzi and dual fock states in mzi are compared in sec .",
    "finally , a conclusion is given in sec .",
    "two - path optical interferometers are widely studied to estimate a completely unknown optical phase @xmath4 from the photon numbers observed in two ports of the output . here",
    "we express the quantum mechanics of two - path interferometers in terms of the spin-@xmath5 algebra of the schwinger representation , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the annihilation operators of the two paths .",
    "eigenstates of @xmath9 can be defined as usual by fock space representation as , latexmath:[\\ ] ] qfi of each superposed state is @xmath93 .",
    "hence , qfi of the intermediate state eq .",
    "( [ dualfock ] ) can be calculated to be @xmath94 .",
    "then qfi of the tmsv is @xmath95 . in comparison , for a superposition of noon states with a same probability distribution as tmsv , @xmath96 ,",
    "the qfi is @xmath97 .",
    "this state saturates the maximum qfi for this probability distribution of total photon number .",
    "crbs of these two states are shown in fig .",
    "[ f3a ] .",
    "second example : similar as the state in eq .",
    "( [ supernoon ] ) , we consider a superposition of dual fock states with the same probability distribution of the photon number , @xmath98 .",
    "when @xmath75 , the average photon number is @xmath99 , and qfi can be calculated as , @xmath100\\rightarrow\\infty$ ] .",
    "subsequently , it is with a zero crb similar as the state in eq .",
    "( [ supernoon ] ) .",
    "the results of these two states are plotted in fig .",
    "note that for probability distribution @xmath101 , the photon number of noon state is @xmath102 in comparing with that of dual fock state .",
    "we can see that when @xmath103 , qfi for noon state case is larger than case of dual fock state ; when @xmath104 , crbs of both states are zeroes .    generally , for any pure intermediate state written as eq .",
    "( [ intermediate ] ) , the form of superposed state @xmath57 and the distribution of photon number @xmath45 are both important to achieve a high qfi in linear two - path interferometers , which can be regarded as the effects of entanglement as well as superposition . a similar discussion can also be found in ref .",
    "another interesting result is that the states with infinite qfi might not have any zeno dynamics since the quantum zeno time scale expressed in terms of qfi , written as @xmath105 @xcite , approaches zero .",
    "we propose that the maximum qfi of states with a fluctuating or fixed number of particles takes the form , @xmath0 in two - path interferometer .",
    "our result shows the superposed noon states by simultaneous measurements achieve this optimal qfi in mmzi .",
    "we also present a specified superposition of noon states with probability distribution related with riemann zeta function .",
    "this state has an infinite qfi but with a finite average photon number via linear two - path interferometer measurements .",
    "we also compare the case of dual fock state in mzi with that of noon state in mmzi .",
    "our work presents that the advantage of this unbounded quantum fisher information can be obtained by only a few superposed terms , which will be beneficial to the future development of quantum technology .",
    "we assume that the entangled photon source in fig .",
    "[ f1b ] could produce superposed noon states .",
    "one area for future research is to prepare superposed noon states when some achievements have been made for the formation of high - noon states @xcite .",
