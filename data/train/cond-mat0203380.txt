    "the nature of fluctuations in both the metallic state @xcite,@xcite , and in disordered insulators @xcite , @xcite , has been a matter of interest for both theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "whereas in the metallic regime the basic aspects of fluctuations have been elucidated , in the regime of hopping transport the nature of fluctuations is still an open field .",
    "the deep insulating regime , dir , where transport occurs via variable range hopping ( vrh ) , is defined as the regime where the localization length is the smallest scale compared to the elastic mean free path and hopping lengths , i.e. , @xmath2 respectively@xcite .",
    "coherence effects are possible in this regime because phase breaking events occur at the hopping length@xcite , which is larger than @xmath3 .",
    "important signatures of quantum interference in disordered insulators are the classic magneto - fingerprints , or reproducible fluctuations in the conductance with magnetic field , and a low field positive magneto - conductance .",
    "an important property of mesoscopic conductance fluctuations in the metallic phase is their ergodicity . at the mesoscopic level ,",
    "the sample size is less than thermal diffusion length or the dephasing length , whatever is shorter , such that sample to sample fluctuations are visible and the system does not self - average .",
    "although it was not rigorously proven , the ergodic hypothesis was meant as the ability of the magnetic field ( or energy ) to induce conductance fluctuations equivalent to sample to sample fluctuations ( lee - stone criterion ) @xcite . in contrast , experimental results show that log - conductance mesoscopic fluctuations in the dir without spin - orbit scattering are not ergodic in the lee - stone sense@xcite , i.e. , the variance over samples is larger than the variance over field .",
    "such samples involve hopping lengths that are , at most , 6 to 10 times the localization length .",
    "precise measurements of ladieu et al@xcite and orlov et al@xcite have shown that a ) field fluctuations do not decorrelate disorder fluctuations , b ) field fluctuations do not change the identity of the hop , c ) the field average of the variance over the samples is larger than the sample average of the variance over the field and d ) there exist a decorrelation field @xmath4 defined by the field correlation function , which defines a equivalent new sample .",
    "the question of the ergodic nature of fluctuations with and without so has not been addressed , to our knowledge , from the theoretical side .",
    "our plan of this work is first to address the problem of fluctuations and the question of ergodicity in dir within the nss model .",
    "we undertake this task through the verification of concepts concerning ergodicity , which we first define with mathematical rigor in the next mostly technical section .",
    "then in section [ sec : nssmodel ] we explain the nss model and define the random processes we want to analyze . in section[sec : fluctuations ] we carry out the program described in section [ sec : ergodicconcepts ] and verify the non - ergodic behavior of fluctuations . in section [ sec : corrcoopdiff ]",
    "we define the main theoretical objects of this work , the cooperon and diffuson analogs of weak localization theory , with the help of which , we can explain to some degree the decaying behavior of the correlation function .",
    "finally we conclude by discussing and comparing our results with experiments .",
    "in the preceding section one we introduced the question of ergodicity of fluctuations . here we introduce the mathematical concepts that will permit us to establish the ergodic nature of the fluctuations .    given a physical quantity @xmath5 depending on the disordered hamiltonian @xmath6 and magnetic field @xmath7 , we denote by @xmath8 the sample to sample average , or disorder average , and by @xmath9 the field average for a given sample or disorder realization . in order to be able to estimate the sample average from the field average of a given sample",
    "the following conditions must be satisfied : a ) @xmath10 @xmath11^{2}}\\rightarrow 0 $ ] and b ) @xmath12 .",
    "the verification of both conditions is known as _ ergodicity in the mean square sense _ ( mss ) , or the random function @xmath13",
    "is said to be ergodic in the mean - square limit@xcite .",
    "the condition @xmath14 is a measure of global stationarity . which means that these averages are independent of @xmath7 .",
    "one can cast conditions a ) and b ) into a single statement on the disorder fluctuations of the field average , i.e .",
    ", @xmath15 , where @xmath16 means variance over disorder@xcite .",
    "this property implies that for one realization of disorder there are enough equivalent samples within the magnetic scale , such that the average in the field , with regard to disorder , does not depend in statistical sense on the particular realization .",
    "this means that @xmath17@xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of realizations , and a sharp distribution of @xmath20 over disorder holds .",
    "one could also ask for the possibility of making estimates of @xmath21 from @xmath22 , ( here @xmath23 means the variance over the field b of @xmath24 ) , or more generally , try to make an estimate of another function of the basic process @xmath25 .",
    "the necessary and sufficient conditions such that one can estimate @xmath26 from one realization of disorder with the field average @xmath27 ( the so called law of strong numbers ) , is given by slutski s theorem .",
    "one can write : @xmath28@xmath29@xmath30 @xmath31 , with : @xmath32}\\times \\overline{[g(f({\\cal h},b))-\\overline{% % \\ g(f({\\cal h},b))}\\ ] }   \\label{defcorrelationfunction}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the correlation function for @xmath34 and @xmath35}$ ] .",
    "one can easily realize that a strong decaying behavior of the correlation function with correlation lenght @xmath36 will be a sufficient condition for ergodicity in the mss , i.e. @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , it is also a necessary condition",
    ".    usually , for the application of the theorem stationarity in the wide sense of @xmath38 can be assumed , i.e. , @xmath39 does not depend on @xmath7 and @xmath40should depends only on @xmath41@xcite . in this work",
    "we are interested in testing the ergodicity in two cases : @xmath42 for the average and @xmath43for the variance .",
    "the first case corresponds to the usual meaning of ergodicity in statistical mechanics .",
    "the second case , usually named the lee - stone criterion , refers to the equivalence of sample to sample fluctuations and magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "we examine now the fluctuations in the dir in two and three dimensions and define the random process @xmath44 .",
    "this is obtained from the nguyen , spivak and shklovskii@xcite model ( nss ) .",
    "the nss model s crucial insight is that coherence is maintained within a mott hopping length , where the conductance is a sum of coherent _ forward directed feynman paths _ which interfere which each other .",
    "the nss model describes the quantum behavior of the critical ( bottleneck ) hop in the miller - abrahams network@xcite .",
    "the existence of many randomly oriented critical hops tend to average the macroscopic conductance , eliminating fluctuations@xcite . here",
    ", we focus on the low temperature regime where critical hops do not trivially self average@xcite@xcite , i.e. , the percolation correlation length @xmath45 is such that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the percolation correlation length exponent , @xmath48 is the spatial dimension and @xmath49 a disorder parameter .",
    "this is the mesoscopic regime @xcite .",
    "we will first find the fields above which the process @xmath50 can be considered stationary and test the ergodicity criterion in the mean square limit .",
    "we then calculate the correlations functions and their decaying behavior .",
    "invoking slutski s theorem , we confirm non - ergodic behavior as established by the finiteness of the mean square criterion , ( @xmath51 @xmath52 ) .",
    "we then proceed to test the ergodicity of fluctuations .",
    "non - ergodicity of fluctuations is implied by the weakly decaying behavior of the correlation function .",
    "we find this consistently . here",
    ", we find good quantitative agreement with the measurements of orlov et al @xcite .",
    "we derive the cooperon and diffuson analogs of the weak localization theory for dir with the help of which the non ergodic behavior can be explained .",
    "furthermore , the predictions for the case with so are made .    in the two dimensional nss model ,",
    "impurities are placed on the sites of a lattice of main diagonal length @xmath53 ( the hopping length , @xmath54 mott s law ) .",
    "we apply a magnetic field @xmath7 , perpendicular to the plane , changing only the phases of the electron paths .",
    "the overall tunneling amplitude is computed by summing all forward directed paths between two diagonally opposed points , each contributing an appropriate quantum mechanical complex @xmath55 matrix weight given by the hamiltonian : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the site energy , and @xmath58 represents the nearest neighbor couplings or transfer terms which includes a randomly chosen su(2 ) matrix describing a spin rotation due to strong so scattering . within the nss model , we choose site energies to be @xmath59 with equal probability @xcite @xcite . without so the coupling terms are diagonal in spin space @xmath60 and the green s function between the initial and final site is given by @xmath61 , \\label{enss}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the phase gained through path @xmath63 due to the magnetic vector potential , @xmath64 represents all directed paths that go from @xmath65 to @xmath66 through the lattice and @xmath67@xcite . in the presence of spinorbit scattering the green s function is the @xmath68 matrix : @xmath69[\\prod_{i_{\\gamma ^{\\prime } } } u_{i_{\\gamma ^{\\prime } } } ] e^{\\sum{i\\phi_{i_{\\gamma^{\\prime}}}}}\\ , \\label{enssso}\\ ] ] the green s function consist of sum of terms , one for each path , each being a product of random numbers and random su(2 ) matrices , and a deterministic disorder independent phase factor from the magnetic vector potential@xcite .",
    "the complex function @xmath70 ( a complex matrix function in the presence of so ) contains the interference information including correlations due to crossing of paths , and the factor @xmath71 is the leading contribution to the exponential decay of the localized wavefunction .",
    "we use the transfer matrix approach in order to compute @xmath72 , exactly , for each realization of disorder@xcite .",
    "our random processes in question represent the log - conductance .",
    "they are @xmath73 and with so @xmath74where @xmath75@xcite . in his work",
    "we measure the magnetic field @xmath7 or changes in magnetic field @xmath41 in flux units @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the flux quantum .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows typical fluctuations of the log - conductance as a function of the sample and the magnetic field . without so",
    ", the figure clearly shows that the average of @xmath78 dominates the fluctuations , i.e. , the average behavior is visible for a single sample .",
    "as the average @xmath79 first increases proportional to @xmath7 , crossing over to a slower growth as @xmath80 dictated by the magnetic length @xmath81 @xcite , the process is not stationary .",
    "however , in the latter regime of slow growth , one finds a field above which the process can be considered as essentially stationary in the same fashion as in the metallic regime . in this regime , while the log - conductance tends to saturate , the fluctuations persist as in mesoscopic fluctuation theory in metals@xcite .",
    "furthermore , we note that the average behavior is periodic in half the flux quantum @xmath82 per @xmath83 ( only one half of a period is shown ) .",
    "this periodicity reveals an average field coupling to @xmath84@xcite which has been demonstrated theoretically@xcite . in three dimensions ,",
    "the fluctuations are appreciably larger than the average behavior .",
    "once more , persistent fluctuations beyond the average conductance saturation field are observed .",
    "the existence of such persistent fluctuations were first surmised by sivan et al@xcite and zhao et al@xcite .",
    "with so , there is no tendency to build an average , and there are in general soft changes in the fluctuations in marked contrast with the sharp changes without so .",
    "this peculiarity will be explained later .",
    "one marked feature of figure 1(with and without so ) , are the fact that disorder fluctuations do not decorrelate the field fluctuations , which is the reason of the remarkable similarity with fig.2 of the work of @xcite .",
    "the key point in both figures is that the the fluctuations do no decorrelate at the scale of fields shown in the figures , suggesting non - ergodic behavior .",
    "following the concepts of section two , we analyze the ergodicity of the log - conductance fluctuations more carefully . to achieve this",
    "we have to check two points : first if stationarity is reasonably fulfilled and second , we have to verify the ergodicity condition and the decaying behavior of the correlation function .",
    "fig.[fig2]a shows the quantities @xmath85(stars ) and @xmath86^{2}}$ ] ( diamonds ) in the absence of so ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "the field averaging interval is @xmath88 $ ] . in this figure as the field @xmath89 is increased from zero to 0.09 in @xmath90 $ ] units , the diamonds move downward overlapping the stars sooner for smaller t. therefore , the field above which the process can be considered quasi stationary increases with the hopping length t such that both quantities tend to coincide for larger @xmath91 .",
    "this feature is of importance for calculating other quantities , as any question on ergodicity presumes at least quasi - stationarity . in the case of so ( @xmath92 ) , fig.[fig2]b shows effective stationarity of the process @xmath93 essentially independent of @xmath94 and @xmath53 . @xmath95 does not tend to zero with increasing @xmath96 ; on the contrary , it increases with a power of t@xcite , which is an indicator of non - ergodic behavior as there is no self - averaging as one increases the hopping length t ( see kramer and mackinnon @xcite ) .",
    "the last result establishes non - ergodic behavior in the mean square sense with and without so . to further substantiate this result",
    "we calculate the correlation functions .",
    "[ fig3]a shows the correlation function for three values of the hopping length @xmath53 and some values for @xmath94 . one sees a very weakly decaying behavior on the physical field scale ( @xmath76 ) and a tendency to decay faster for bigger @xmath91 , indicating that when the process becomes quasi stationary there is a tendency to a faster decaying correlation function .",
    "[ fig3]b with so shows that the correlations function depends essentially only on @xmath97 and the decaying is even weaker with a functional form depending on t. now , the basic argument against ergodicity is that the decaying behavior of the correlation functions is such that it is not possible to construct enough ensembles from the field fluctuations data and therefore non - ergodic behavior is established . to illustrate this point",
    ", we write @xmath98 $ ] . in order to have enough emsembles in the field scale within the validity of the model ( @xmath99 @xmath100 in our units )",
    ", there should be a decorrelation field @xmath4 @xmath101 such that large number of samples could be defined , so that one would get @xmath102-could be satisfied .",
    "this , on the other hand , implies that the condition for ergodicity of the variance , which in general requires a stronger decaying behavior of the correlation function for process @xmath103 than the condition required for ergodicity in the mean square sense , is not at all fulfilled@xcite .",
    "therefore , one should expect that the lee and stone criterion of ergodicity on the relative magnitude of the field and sample fluctuations is not realized . to check this point",
    "one has to compare the magnitude of the variance in field and sample to sample fluctuations .",
    "the idea of further averaging over disorder and over the field , respectively , is the same as in statistical mechanics using different initial conditions to improve the statistics .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the averages @xmath104    @xmath105    without so we find the characteristic @xmath91dependence shown in fig.[fig2 ] shows up as a crossing of both types of averages .",
    "there is again a clear tendency to saturate as @xmath91increases whereas the difference of the saturated averages widens with increasing t. this tendency is clearly seen in the case with so where there is a much weaker dependence on @xmath91 as expected from fig.[fig2 ] and the crossing observed in the previous case is absent .",
    "in this section we develop the concepts of the cooperon and diffuson in the context of strong localization .",
    "these objects are used to explain qualitatively and semi - quantitatively non - ergodic behavior in the mean square sense and the relative magnitude of the field and sample fluctuations found in experiments . for this purpose ,",
    "the following relation is straightforwardly derived : @xmath106={\\rm var}_{d}[f(b+\\delta b , t)]+{\\rm var}% _ { d}[f(b , t)]+2c(f({\\cal h},b,\\delta b , t ) )   \\label{nonlinear}\\ ] ]    this relation is valid for both processes @xmath107 and @xmath108@xcite . for the sake of clarity , the composite process inside the brackets on the left side of eqn.[nonlinear ]",

    "three things deserve explanations : first for large enough @xmath117 , the above mentioned functions show almost no dependence on @xmath91and @xmath117 at fixed t ; secondly , the ratio @xmath118/$ ] @xmath119\\ $ ] is around two , for big enough t and @xmath120 which is a landmark of the symmetry changing from unitary to simpletic ; thirdly , one observes a very rapid decaying on the dependence on @xmath7 , which can be traced to the saturation behavior of the cooperon as we will see .    recall that on the metallic side , an analogous behavior has been described which identifies two fundamental contributions to the field effect : the cooperon and the diffuson@xcite@xcite .",
    "these contributions can be distinguished by the way they enclose the magnetic flux ; while the cooperon is sensitive to ( @xmath121 , the diffuson only responds to field changes @xmath41 . in the insulating regime , a mechanism similar to the cooperon which saturates is associated with a positive magneto - conductance ( mc )",
    "this has been observed as a general effect@xcite@xcite .",
    "a semi quantitative explanation for the behavior of the functions @xmath122\\ $ ] and @xmath123 $ ] and their ratio can be found with the help of the cooperon and diffuson analogs . to achieve this goal",
    ", we consider the moments of process of @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( further below it will become clear why ) . in the former case",
    "they are given by @xmath126^{n}}$ ] .",
    "recall from equations [ enss ] and [ enssso ] that this product can be visualized as a set of n paths , each one defined by the respective term in the product .",
    "these paths eventually intersect each other at some values of their length . in order to have nonzero contributions after disorder average",
    ", the paths must pair up , as a consequence of th chosen distribution of the energies @xcite .",
    "neutral paths ( field independent ) are formed by pairing @xmath127 and @xmath128 at the same field ( phase cancels ) . on the other hand ,",
    "charged paths ( field sensible ) are formed by pairing either @xmath129 and @xmath130 or @xmath131 and @xmath132 . in the absence of paired path intersections ,",
    "self interference kills charged paths ( their contribution decays exponentially fast ) .",
    "nevertheless , if intersections are considered , one can have path exchanges for short distances , yielding a magnetic field coupling which is analogous to the magneto - conductance , the source of the initial decaying of the correlation function .",
    "there are three possible diagrams at a paired path crossing , two of which are depicted in fig.7 . without so the spin indexes can be ignored ,",
    "one obtains @xcite : a ) one partner from @xmath131 pairs with one from @xmath132 while one from @xmath133 and one from @xmath130 follow a different path .",

    "finally , one can have combination c ) where one partner comes from @xmath131 and the other from @xmath133 , leaving @xmath132 and @xmath130 to pair up .",
    "the latter combination is called uncharged and encloses no field .",
    "note that all previous cases satisfy overall neutrality so that the contributions are real as expected .",
    "the contribution of the replica cooperon and diffuson are the same at zero field and there is an additional contribution from the uncharged diagram .",
    "further progress is achieved using the replica argument .",
    "the replica - moment argument @xcite , maps the @xmath135-th moment problem onto the problem of @xmath136 bosons with contact interaction .",
    "these interactions renormalize due to the diagrams above , making path interactions field dependent .",

    "<S> this finding corroborate the behavior of the fluctuations of the field average of the log - conductance and permit us to invoke slutski s theorem to conclude that the whole stochastic process defined by the log - conductance is non - ergodic in the mean square sense in both cases . as a consequence the commonly used criterion to test the ergodicity based on the equivalence of the variance in disorder and the variance in the field is not fulfilled . using the replica approach , we derive the weak localization analogs of the  cooperon and diffuson which permits us to analyze in qualitative form the decaying behavior of the correlation function . </S>",
