    "in computer science one usually considers either finite computations or infinite ones .",
    "the infinite computations have length @xmath0 , which is the first infinite ordinal .",
    "the theory of automata reading infinite words , which is closely related to infinite games , is now a rich theory which is used for the specification and verification of non - terminating systems , see @xcite .",
    "connections between automata theory and set theory have arosen in the study of monadic theories of well orders .",
    "for example , gurevich , magidor and shelah proved in @xcite that the monadic theory of @xmath15 , where @xmath15 is the second uncountable cardinal , may have different complexities depending on the actual model of * zfc * ( the commonly accepted axiomatic framework for set theory in which all usual mathematics can be developped ) , and the monadic theory of @xmath15 is in turn closely related to the emptiness problem for automata reading transfinite words of length @xmath15 .",
    "another example is given by @xcite , in which neeman considered some automata reading much longer transfinite words to study the monadic theory of some larger uncountable cardinal .",
    "however , the cardinal @xmath15 is very large with respect to @xmath0 , and therefore the connections between automata theory and set theory seemed very far from the practical aspects of computer science .",
    "indeed one usually thinks that the finite or infinite computations appearing in computer science are  well defined \" in the axiomatic framework of mathematics , and thus one could be tempted to consider that a property on automata is either true or false and that one has not to take care of the different models of set theory ( except perhaps for the continuum hypothesis * ch * which is known to be independent from * zfc * ) .    in @xcite",
    "we have recently proved a surprising result : the topological complexity of an @xmath0-language accepted by a @xmath2-counter bchi automaton , or of an infinitary rational relation accepted by a @xmath11-tape bchi automaton , is not determined by the axiomatic system * zfc*. in particular , there is a @xmath2-counter bchi automaton @xmath3 ( respectively , a @xmath11-tape bchi automaton @xmath12 ) and two models @xmath16 and @xmath17 of * zfc * such that the @xmath0-language @xmath1 ( respectively , the infinitary rational relation @xmath18 ) is borel in @xmath16 but not in @xmath17 .",
    "we prove in this paper other surprising results , showing that some basic questions on automata reading infinite words actually depend on the models of * zfc*. in particular , we prove the following result : there exists a @xmath2-counter bchi automaton @xmath3 such that the cardinality of the complement @xmath4 of the @xmath0-language @xmath1 is not determined by * zfc*. indeed it holds that :    ( 1 ) .",

    "there is a model @xmath6 of * zfc * in which @xmath4 has cardinal @xmath7 .    ( 3 ) . there is a model @xmath8 of * zfc * in which @xmath4 has cardinal @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "notice that there are only these three possibilities for the cardinality of the complement of an @xmath0-language accepted by a bchi @xmath2-counter automaton @xmath3 because the @xmath0-language @xmath1 is an analytic set and thus @xmath4 is a coanalytic set , see @xcite .",
    "we prove a very similar result for the complement of an infinitary rational relation accepted by a @xmath11-tape bchi automaton @xmath12 . as a corollary ,",
    "this proves that the continuum hypothesis may be not satisfied for complements of @xmath2-counter @xmath0-languages and for complements of infinitary rational relations accepted by @xmath11-tape bchi automata .    in the proof of these results",
    ", we consider the largest thin ( i.e. , without perfect subset ) effective coanalytic subset of the cantor space @xmath19 , whose existence was proven by kechris in @xcite and independently by guaspari and sacks .",
    "an important property of @xmath20 is that its cardinal depends on the models of set theory .",
    "we use this fact and some constructions from recent papers @xcite to infer our new results about @xmath2-counter or @xmath11-tape bchi automata .    combining the proof of the above results with shoenfield s absoluteness theorem",
    "we get that basic decision problems about @xmath2-counter @xmath0-languages or infinitary rational relations are actually located at the * third level * of the analytical hierarchy . in particular , the problem to determine whether the complement of a @xmath2-counter @xmath0-language ( respectively , infinitary rational relation ) is countable is in @xmath13 .",
    "this is rather surprising if compared to the fact that it is * decidable * whether an infinitary rational relation is countable ( respectively , uncountable ) .",
    "as a by - product of these results we get a ( partial ) answer to a question of castro and cucker about @xmath0-languages of turing machines .    the paper is organized as follows .",
