    "searching and staying up - to - date with scholarly literature is an essential part of scientific research . with the advent of the world - wide web ( www ) and the evolution of electronic publishing , a powerful environment",
    "was created to open the vast universe of scientific literature on a world - wide scale . in early 1994",
    "the www had become sophisticated enough to allow the search of electronic resources via `` web forms '' . over the past decade , this environment matured into an unavoidable and indispensable fact of life and tools have emerged in it that have become a crucial ingredient in scientific research .",
    "being able to search vast amounts of data electronically obviously facilitates the review process , but applying advanced technologies such as pattern recognition to the electronic data or by allowing nested searches , one is able to produce results that are unattainable in conventional , non - electronic ways . in that sense",
    "one can argue that the available electronic search tools on the www even further scientific research .    using a straight - forward search engine ( google , yahoo , msn , altavista , ... ) results in thousands of documents , ranked by some sophisticated algorithm .",
    "even with the advanced versions of these tools , we still find ourselves awash in information . to search the electronic , scholarly literature , scientists need to be able to zoom in on bibliographic data using additional descriptors and search logic .",
    "what scholarly tools are available for specialists in astronomy and ( astro)physics ? the principal bibliographic services are the nasa astrophysics data system ( nasa ads ) , google scholar , inspec and the astronomy and astrophysics abstracts .",
    "important additional resources are the science citation index ( isi web of science ) , scopus and zetoc .",
    "although these tools allow researchers to zoom in on the scholarly literature , they do not offer additional tools to determine the most popular or most cited papers in a given subject . especially for staying up - to - date ,",
    "it is essential to be notified of the most popular and most cited papers .",
    "late 2003 , the ads introduced the _ myads _",
    "service @xcite , a fully customizable newspaper covering ( journal ) research for astronomy , physics and/or the arxiv e - prints .",
    "this service will give the user an overview of the most recent papers by his / her favorite authors , and the most recent , most cited and most popular papers in a particular subject area .",
    "additionally , the user will see an overview of citations to his / her papers . between a fifth and a quarter of all",
    "working astronomers already subscribe to myads @xcite .",
    "_ myads - arxiv _ is a fully customizable , open access , virtual journal , covering the most important papers of the past week in physics and astronomy . in other words , for the specialist",
    ", the myads - arxiv service provides a one stop shop for staying up - to - date in his / her field of interest .",
    "myads - arxiv is based on the existing services of the nasa astrophysics data system ( see @xcite and wikipedia ) and the arxiv e - print repository ( see @xcite @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the ads repository is completely synchronized with the arxiv e - prints system .",
    "each night ads bibliographic records are created for all the e - prints that were newly added . the references are also extracted from the e - prints and matched against existing records in the ads . thus we add lists of references to the bibliographic records and we use these references to maintain citation statistics . both of these elements are used in the myads - arxiv service .",
    "the service also uses readership information from both the ads and the arxiv to compute the most popular papers in a subject area . by this continuous influx of information ,",
    "myads - arxiv provides the subscriber with a service that is as up - to - date as your morning newspaper .",
    "the service provides a weekly overview , which offers the unique view on what is happening in a field , and a daily notification . why is this view unique ? it is * fully customizable * because you specify the queries that determine the results .",
    "myads - arxiv is an * open access * service , because it is _ totally free _",
    "( no subscription costs ) .",
    "furthermore , it is a * virtual journal * , because the overview is a regularly appearing collection of scholarly papers , that are only available in electronic format ( the vast majority of e - prints have not yet been published as journal papers ) .",
    "last but not least , myads - arxiv covers the * most important * papers of the past week .",
    "this follows from concordance between e - printed and published papers , and citation statistics : in astronomy and physics , the most important papers are submitted as e - prints first @xcite .",
    "the url for the service is * http://myads.harvard.edu*. from here , you can set up your account and specify the queries for the myads - arxiv service .",
    "a maximum of 2 subject queries and 1 author query can be specified .",
    "the results page is like an an automatically generated newsletter . for each of your subject queries",
    ", you will get an overview of the `` recent '' , `` most popular '' and `` most cited '' papers .",
    "the `` recent '' papers are the newly ( i.e. since the previous query ) added entries in the e - print database that match your query .",
    "the `` most popular '' papers are found by looking at the also - read statistics for the top 100 of all papers that match your query and the `` most cited '' papers are obtained from the reference lists of the papers that match your query , published in the previous three months .",
    "the link to this newsletter is public , so it can be shared with colleagues .",
    "there is also a daily alerting service , showing you the latest e - prints in the categories of your choice , sorted according to a query specified by you ( or e - print number if you did not specify one ) .",
    "entries that match you query are preceded by an asterisk .",
    "why is myads - arxiv so unique and powerful ? it is because of the combination of the following two factors : the search capabilities of the myads - arxiv service guarantees the proper selection of bibliographic records for your queries , and the quality of the e - prints guarantees the relevance and importance of the bibliographic records .",
    "the unique machinery that powers the queries consists of _ reference resolving _ ( associating reference strings with existing bibliographic records , see @xcite ) , _ bibcode matching _ ( setting up the e - print / paper concordance ) , _ second order operators _ ( operations on results lists ) and _ also - read statistics _ ( `` people who read paper x , also read paper y '' , see @xcite ) . by associating reference lists in newly added papers with already existing records , we keep citation statistics up - to - date , which allows us to generate lists of `` most cited papers '' . with the reads statistics",
    ", we can construct a list of `` most popular papers '' , using the second order operators .",
    "the bibcode matching procedure is only relevant in cases where the preprint already appeared in a journal .",
    "titles , abstracts and author lists are indexed , so that they are available for searching .",
    "the quality of the e - prints is reflected in the observation : the most important papers in astronomy and physics appear as e - prints on the arxiv .",
    "this fact is illustrated by figure 1 ( left ) , which shows for a number of important astronomy and physics journals , the fraction of e - printed papers for the top 100 most cited papers , during the period of 1992 through 2005 . over 90%",
    "appears as e - print first ( for month .",
    "notices ras and nucl .",
    "b , it is even 100% ) .",
    "just the effect of primacy through early access is not enough to explain the fraction of e - printed papers in the top 100 most cited papers ( at a given moment ) . according to @xcite",
    "there is an effect called `` self - selection bias '' that results in a further increase of citation rates for e - printed papers .",
    "`` because papers in the arxiv are not refereed ... this suggests that authors self - censor or self - promote , or that for some reason the most citable authors are also those who first use the new publication venue '' @xcite .",
    "the papers are not cited more because they are read more , they are cited more and read more because of their quality .",
    "figure 1 ( right ) illustrates the fact that e - printed papers are cited and read more than papers that did not appear as e - print .",
    "the rule `` better searches give better results '' most definitely applies to the myads - arxiv service .",
    "based on the sophisticated search capabilities of the ads , myads - arxiv will provide the most powerful results for those who are able to characterize a field in a couple of keywords and key phrases .",
    "additionally , the use of `` simple logic '' allows a user to really zoom in on a specific research field .",
    "the myads - arxiv service is unique in the world of electronic libraries and publishing .",
    "no other electronic newsletter or alerting service produces a view on the scholarly physics and astronomy literaturei as comprehensive as this service . from the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics press release in spaceref.ca ( article number 16658 ) on the myads - arxiv service : `` it s the best thing since two pieces of sliced bread were assembled to make a sandwich , '' said paul ginsparg , professor of physics and information science at cornell university ( april 17 , 2005 ) .",
