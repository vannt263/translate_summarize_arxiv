    "such bcds that are making _ all _ of their stars in the on - going starburst could be considered to be local examples of primeval galaxies ( thuan & izotov 1998 ) and they would be fundamentally different from old galaxies which began forming their first stars over 10  gyrs ago at high redshifts .",

    "owing to our observation that the cmd of the halo of vii  zw  403 is very reminiscent of that of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dsph ) , and in connection with the interesting question of what is the nature of the faint blue galaxies , we compare the scale length of vii  zw  403 to that of dsphs .",

    "is fairly typical for that of bcds .",
    "several pieces of evidence now suggest that vii  zw  403 has an old stellar halo , and this has implications for the formation of bcds .    while it has previously been assumed that red colors at large radii point to the presence of evolved stellar background sheets in bcds , the rsg , agb and rgb stars actually overlap over a wide range in effective temperatures and hence colors ( cf . fig .",
    "therefore , a red background sheet can not be considered as evidence of an old , underlying host galaxy unless it can be proven that the stellar population which dominates the integrated color of a bcd is an old one .",
    "this has now been accomplished with the detection of red giants in the halo of vii  zw  403 .",
    "however , owing to the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy , comparatively young ( @xmath4  1  gyr ) and metal rich rgb stars can populate the same region of a cmd as old ( 10 - 15  gyr ) and metal poor rgb stars , based on optical , broad - band colors .",

    "vii  zw  403 does not appear to have a globular - cluster system .",
    "recently , the stellar halos of several dwarf irregular ( dirr ) and transition dirr / dsph galaxies in the local group have been resolved into stars ( wlm , minniti & zijlstra 1996 , ngc  3109 , minniti et al .",

    "vii  zw  403 joins the ranks of an increasing number of local , star - forming dwarf galaxies with resolved old stellar halos .",
    "as is pointed out by mateo ( 1998 ) , all suitably studied star - forming dwarfs of the local group show evidence for extended , smooth , and symmetric distributions for their older stars .",
    "most bcds show extended , smooth and red outer isophotes as well . our results for vii  zw  403",
    "imply the identification of the background sheets with old stellar halos is justified for these bcds .    the controversy over the age of bcds",
    " whether they are young or old galaxies  may be resolved in the following way : there is a continuum of star - formation and chemical - enrichment histories among the bcds .",
    "it is likely that the vast majority of bcds have an ancient ( @xmath0  10  gyr ) stellar population substratum , and must thus be recognized as old galaxies .",
    "this is based on the observation that over 95% of bcds in the loose & thuan sample show extended background sheets of red color . comparing observations of the background - sheet colors for a sample of bcds and dirrs with the population synthesis models of schmidt et al .",
    "( 1985 ) , schulte - ladbeck & hopp ( 1998 ) suggest that complex star - formation histories prevail in these galaxies .",
    "thus , depending on just how much mass is involved in the on - going starburst , and how the morphology of the star - forming regions compares to that of the older stellar substratum , the colors of some bcds might be entirely consistent with those of  young \" galaxies in the sense that they are currently experiencing a strong starburst .",
    "if the outer isophotes are sufficiently red in color , they can be interpreted to indicate that such bcds formed some stars at epochs similar to that of galactic globular cluster formation ( kunth et al .",

    "1997 , schulte - ladbeck & hopp 1998 , meurer 1999 ) .",
    "the range of background - sheet colors suggests that the sfhs of most bcds since their formation at high redshift have probably been diverse , depending on the frequency , duration , and intensity of the star - formation events .",
    "this is similar to what has been derived for dwarf galaxies within our local group .    in a few of the extremely metal - poor bcds , the color gradients are small and the outer isophotes remain fairly blue ( hunter & thronson 1995 , thuan at al .",

    "( 1985 ) show that a starburst completely dominates integrated optical colors for up to 50  myr , even if as little as 0.1% of the dwarf galaxy s mass is involved ; hence a young burst may render the underlying old population undetectable .",
    "it is therefore possible ( although in the absence of deep cmds not yet demonstrated ) that the old populations in these few extremely metal - poor bcds elude us due to a contrast problem .    on the other hand ,",
    "the cmds of the few bcds which have been resolved with hst into single stars indicate they do contain stellar generations which predate the present starburst . in figure 6 , we show the evolution of vii  zw  403 in a series of synthetic  snapshot \" cmds .",

    "we used the bologna code , which was recently adapted by greggio et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for the simulation of hst data .",
    "the synthetic cmds help to illustrate the general features of stellar evolution at low metallicity , and may also serve as templates for future cmds of extremely metal - poor bcds .",
    "the panels of fig .  6 show very well that the observed changes in stellar population with radius ( fig .",

    "we use synthetic cmds to place a lower limit on the age of the red giants that we see in the halo of vii  zw  403 .",
    "we find a well defined trgb first appears for ages @xmath0  3  gyr ( and of course continues to be present up to 15  gyrs ) . beyond an age of about 3  gyr",
    ", we lose age resolution in the cmd ; and we can not constrain , from the location of the rgb alone , the presence of stars with ages in excess of 10  gyr .",
    "clearly , vii  zw  403 has had a rich history of star formation .",
    "aloisi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) recently used synthetic cmds to investigate deep hst cmds of i  zw  18 , the most metal - poor bcd known ( z@xmath2/50 , from the ionized gas ) .",
    "they find that the present burst is not the first one to occur in this galaxy either ; the data require a prior burst 500  myr to 1  gyr ago .",
    "while by most accounts a galaxy with an age below 1  gyr would be considered a young galaxy , these results for i  zw  18 are in contradiction with the primeval galaxy hypothesis of izotov & thuan ( 1999 ) based on abundance analyses .    unfortunately , there are no extremely metal - poor bcds known that are closeby enough to allow for look - back times of a large fraction of the hubble time . whether or not we are observing a very small percentage of extremely metal - poor bcds while they are undergoing their very first starburst at the present epoch is an interesting suggestion which remains to be investigated further ; it will depend critically on the cycling of their gas ( see below ) .",
    "vii  zw  403 shows evidence for at least three  eras \" of star formation .",
    "the rgb stars suggest the first event occured at a look - back time of at least 3  gyr and probably @xmath010  gyr , the agb stars indicate star - formation also happened at around 4  gyr ago ( with considerable uncertainty ) , and the young stars testify to activity which took place less than about 1  gyr ago .",
    "the data also allow us to infer the chemical enrichment history of vii  zw  403 . the rgb stars are consistent with a metallicity of the order of z@xmath2/100 , while the ionized gas and ( by assumption ) the young stars are at @xmath4z@xmath2/20 ( martin 1997 , izotov et al .",
    "curiously , an extended agb is not expected unless z / z@xmath2@xmath01/20 ( see sch98 , lynds et al .",
    "1998 ) . the enrichment history of vii",
    "zw  403 , at face value , is therefore inconsistent with closed - box models of galaxy evolution and seems to require the loss of enriched gas or accretion of metal - poor gas .",
    "vii  zw  403 is isolated from massive neighbors , so an accrection scenario  la silk et al .",
    "( 1987 ) seems unlikely .",
    "papaderos et al .",
    "( 1994 ) claim the x - ray detection of an outflow of hot gas from this galaxy .",
    "employing our new distance , we can estimate the total gas ( h - i mass ) from the measurements of thuan & martin ( 1981 ) and tully et al .",
    "( 1981 ) to be about 7x10@xmath16  m@xmath2 .",
    "this places vii  zw  403 in the mass range for which models suggest that gas may be blown out , but the entire gas reservoir may not be blown away ( mac low & ferrara 1999 ) .",
    "the bcd vii  zw  403 exhibits a radial population gradient .",
    "young , blue stars and h@xmath6 emission are confined to the core . the core region has a diameter which equals the defining size of a bcd . intermediate - age and old ,",
    "red stars are distributed throughout an extended background sheet or halo .",
    "the halo stars show an rgb with a well defined tip and are interpreted to be an old and metal - poor population , similar to that in galactic globular clusters .",
    "bcds were once recognized as `` the first metal - poor systems of population i to be discovered '' ( searle & sargent 1972 ) .",
    "vii  zw  403 is the first bcd with compelling evidence for the existence of a population ii halo .",
    "vii  zw  403 is also the first bcd for which a direct comparison has been possible between the results from population synthesis of the integrated halo color and resolved stellar content .",
    "the detection of red giants at large distances from the starburst center verifies previous identifications of red halos with old stellar populations .",
    "if all bcd halos harbor old stars , then they must have formed at high redshift and survived re - heating ; bcds would not require the delayed - formation scenario .",

    "<S> while the vast majority of blue compact dwarf galaxies has been recognized to possess halos of red color in ground - based surface photometry , our observations of vii  zw  403 establish for the first time a direct correspondence between a red halo color and the presence of old , red giant stars . if the halos of blue compact dwarf galaxies are all home to such ancient stellar populations , then the fossil record conflicts with delayed - formation scenarios for dwarfs . </S>"
