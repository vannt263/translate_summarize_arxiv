    "in this article we are interested in the case that the @xmath1-valued strong markov process with absorbing state at zero , @xmath2 , is a conservative , supercritical continuous - state branching process with general branching mechanism @xmath3 taking the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a measure concentrated on @xmath8 which satisfies @xmath9 and a general immigration mechanism @xmath10 taking the form @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a measure concentrated on @xmath8 which satisfies @xmath14 .",
    "our requirement that @xmath15 is supercritical and conservative means that we necessarily have that @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the process @xmath15 , henceforth denoted a @xmath18-csbp , can be described through its semi - group as follows .",
    "suppose that @xmath19 denotes the law of @xmath15 on cadlag path space @xmath20 when the process is issued from @xmath21 .",
    "then the semi - group associated with the @xmath22-csbp can be described as follows .",
    "for all @xmath23 it necessarily follows that @xmath24 where @xmath25 uniquely solves the evolution equation @xmath26 with initial condition @xmath27 .",
    "note in particular that @xmath25 describes the semi - group of the @xmath28-csbp .",
    "another process related to the @xmath29-csbp is that of the @xmath29-csbp conditioned to become extinguished . to understand what this means ,",
    "let us momentarily recall that for all supercritical continuous - state branching processes ( without immigration ) the event @xmath30 occurs with positive probability .",
    "moreover , for all @xmath21 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the unique root on @xmath8 of the equation @xmath33 . note that @xmath3 is strictly convex with the property that @xmath34 and @xmath35 , thereby ensuring that the root @xmath36 exists ; see chapter 8 and 9 of @xcite for further details .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the law of @xmath37 conditional on the event @xmath30 , say @xmath38 , agrees with the law of a @xmath39-csbp where @xmath40 see for example sheu @xcite .    in dusquene and winkel @xcite and berestycki et al .",
    "@xcite it was shown for the case that @xmath41 that the law of process @xmath15 can be recovered from a supercritical continuous - time galton - watson process ( gw ) , issued with a poisson number of initial ancestors , and dressed in a poissonian way using the law of the the original process conditioned to become extinguished .    to be more precise , they showed that for each @xmath21 , @xmath37 has the same law as the process @xmath42 which has the following pathwise construction .",

    "see @xcite for further details . moreover , on the event that an individual dies and branches into @xmath47 offspring , with probability @xmath64 , an additional independent @xmath39-csbp is grafted on to the branching point with initial mass @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity @xmath65 is now understood to be the total dressed mass present at time @xmath56 together with the mass present at time @xmath56 in an independent @xmath55-csbp issued at time zero with initial mass @xmath66 .    our objective here is to describe a similar decomposition for the @xmath18-csbp . in the case",
    "that we include immigration , it will turn out that the backbone is rather naturally replaced by a continuous - time galton - watson process with immigration .",
    "in order to describe the backbone decomposition for the @xmath18-csbp , let us first remind ourselves of the basic structure of a continuous - time galton - watson process with immigration .",
    "such processes are characterised by the two generators @xmath67 where , as mentioned before , @xmath68 encodes the fact that individuals live for an independent and exponentially distributed length of time , after which they give birth to a random number of offspring with distribution @xmath45 , and @xmath69 reflecting the fact that at times of a poisson arrival process with rate @xmath70 , a random number of immigrants with distribution @xmath71 issue independent copies of a continuous - time galton - watson process with generator @xmath72 .",
    "our forthcoming backbone decomposition will be built from an @xmath73-gw process with @xmath72 given by ( [ f ] ) and @xmath74 it can be seen from the above expression for @xmath75 that @xmath76 . to describe the distribution @xmath71",

    "here the process , @xmath54 , the backbone , is an @xmath73-gw process as described above with the additional property that @xmath52 is poisson distributed in number with rate @xmath85 .",
    "the process of continuous mass , @xmath86 , is described as follows .",
    "\\(i ) as in @xcite , along the life length of each individual alive in the process @xmath54 , there is poissonian dressing with rate @xmath87    \\(ii ) at the branch points of @xmath54 , on the event that there are @xmath88 offspring , an additional copy of a @xmath39-csbp with initial mass @xmath49 is issued with probability @xmath89 .",
    "\\(iii ) at the same time , along the time - line between each immigration of @xmath54 , there is again poissonian dressing with rate @xmath90    \\(iv ) moreover , on the event that there are @xmath91 immigrants in @xmath54 , an additional copy of a @xmath55-csbp with initial mass @xmath49 is issued with probability @xmath92 .",
    "the quantity @xmath65 is now taken to be the total dressed mass present at time @xmath56 together with the mass at time @xmath56 in an independent @xmath55-csbp issued at time zero with initial mass @xmath66 .",

    "the law of @xmath37 agrees with that of @xmath99 .",
    "moreover , for all @xmath100 , the law of @xmath101 given @xmath65 is that of a poisson random variable with law @xmath102 .",
    "the above decomposition complements the recent work of cao and winkel @xcite . in their paper , it is shown how to consistently grow gw trees with immigration in such a way that , with suitable rescaling , the resulting total mass at each fixed time converges in law to that of a @xmath18-csbp process . in some sense , the decomposition in theorem [ bb ] gives a slightly richer description of what the rescaled gw trees with immigration in @xcite will converge to .    before progressing to the proof , we note that the above theorem can also be cited in the setting of a general superprocess where the motion , taken as a general borel right markov process with lusin state space , is independent of the branching mechanism ( now reading @xmath103 and @xmath86 as random measures ) with minor modification to the forthcoming proof , providing one insists further that @xmath104 .",

    "we use it here in a reduced form ( the spacial movement of particles is reduced to a fixed point ) .",
