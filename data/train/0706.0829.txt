    "during the last several years there has been considerably grown interest in the description of essentially nonequilibrium systems using quasiequilibrium notions , namely , the concept of `` superstatistics '' by beck & cohen @xcite .",
    "briefly , it assumes the stationary state @xmath0 of a nonequilibrium system can be written in the boltzmann form with averaging over possible fluctuations in the inverse temperature @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the probability distribution of the inverse temperature , @xmath4 is the effective energy of the system state @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the partition function for a fixed value of @xmath1 .",
    "representation   is actually a generalization of the so - called nonextensive statistics introduced by tsallis @xcite and in a integral form relates powerlike and boltzmann distributions @xcite .",
    "the main idea of superstatistics , however , seems to have a longer history @xcite , at least , expressions similar to eq .   can be found in monograph by lavenda @xcite and this problem goes back to szilard @xcite and mandelbrot @xcite as well as the results of hungarian school on information theory @xcite .",
    "moreover , in an effort to derive representation   starting from the general description of statistical systems ones have met fundamental problems and inconsistencies @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the superstatistical description is rather natural especially for systems exhibiting large - scale fluctuations in temperature gradients @xcite or flow turbulence , where the spatiotemporal fluctuations in the energy dispersion is the standard fact going back to early work by kolmogorov @xcite .    in spite of fundamental problems met in justifying expression   the number of papers dealing with the superstatistics",
    "has increased remarkably in the last years . in particular ,",
    "it has been applied to lagrangian @xcite and eulerian turbulence @xcite , defect turbulence @xcite , atmospheric turbulence @xcite , cosmic ray statistics @xcite , statistics of solar flares @xcite , hadronization of quark matter @xcite , small - world networks @xcite , multi - components self - gravitating systems and collisionless stellar systems @xcite , transitions between regular - chaotic dynamics @xcite , particle ensembles with fractional reactions @xcite , analysis of time series @xcite , econophysics @xcite .    in some sense expression",
    "can be interpreted in two fashions .",
    "the first way is to regard expression   as a rather formal expansion of the stationary distribution for a nonequilibrium system over terms having the boltzmann form . in this case",
    "the main problem is the relationship between the weights @xmath3 of this expansion and specific random processes governing the system dynamics , which is currently the main direction of researches carried out in this field ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the other could be an attempt to represent a nonequilibrium system with nonzero stationary probability flux as a certain superposition of its subsystems being equilibrium , i.e. within which the detailed balance holds individually .",
    "exactly this idea is the goal of our study .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to implement this approach to describing the stationary properties of a nonequilibrium markovian system .",
    "naturally , the final integral over possible subsystems with local equilibrium has to be of a more general form than formula   and is reduced to it in special cases only , which is the reason of using the term `` generalized superstatistics '' .",
    "there has been a great deal of studying nonequilibrium markovian systems within the frameworks of the master equation , for a review see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite . during the last decades many nonequilibrium systems as well as systems of other nature where the equilibrium notion is irrelevant came into view of physical society .",
    "this , in particular , has reawaken the interest to the general steady state properties exhibited by markovian systems without detailed balance and posed a question about their minimal mesoscopic description called dynamic equivalence classes @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . within the latter approach it makes an attempt to find aggregated characteristics determining the steady state distribution as well as probability fluxes in a nonequilibrium system without detailed description of all the transition rates between the system states . in the present work",
    "we actually follow the spirit of this idea .",
    "we consider a markovian system with a finite number of states @xmath7 .",
    "this number , however , may take any large value , so , there should be a feasibility to generalize the following constructions to systems with infinite number of states .",
    "the system evolution is described by the master equation @xmath8 written for the distribution function @xmath9 , where @xmath10 stands for the rate of system transitions to state @xmath5 from state @xmath11 .",
    "all the system states make up a graph @xmath12 whose edges present possible transitions between the states . without loss of generality we may adopt two assumptions about this graph , following , e.g. , ref .  @xcite .",
    "first , if there exists a transition from some state @xmath11 to some state @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath13 , then the reverse transition is also possible , i.e. @xmath14 . the opposite case is included within the limit @xmath15 .",
    "second , the graph @xmath12 is connected , which implies that for each pair of states , i.e. graph nodes @xmath16 , there exists at least one path @xmath17 on the graph @xmath12 ( sequence of joint edges ) connecting them .",
    "otherwise , the physical system behind the graph @xmath12 can be decomposed into two or more independent subsystems analyzed individually .",
    "is shown above . ]",
    "the following part of the paper will deal only with the steady state properties of such markovian systems described by the stationary solution @xmath18 of the master equation  ( [ mp:1 ] ) .",
    "this solution is represented using kirchhoff s diagram technique ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "it applies to the notion of maximal trees . by definition , a maximal tree @xmath19 for the given graph",
    "@xmath12 is its subgraph without cycles that contains all the nodes .",

    "for the three state system under consideration applying to fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] we can write , for example , @xmath51 whence it follows that the effective energies @xmath52 , @xmath53 of the trees @xmath54 , @xmath55 can not be represented in terms of one energy @xmath56 multiplied by some individual cofactors @xmath57 ,",
    "@xmath58 , i.e. there is no function @xmath56 such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 . indeed , otherwise , the relations @xmath61 and @xmath62 have to hold simultaneously .      at the next step a special case of markovian systems is analyzed , where there are collections of many maximal trees within which the detailed balance holds individually .",
    "namely , let us consider some two maximal trees @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and the union of their edges @xmath65 referred below as to the tree superposition .",
    "the two trees are said to be equivalent , @xmath66 , if their superposition does not contain any cycle @xmath67 of edges with nonzero probability flux @xmath68 , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . applying , for example ,",
    "to the cycle @xmath67 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the condition of zero probability flux reads @xmath69 thus @xmath70 whence , by virtue of ( [ mp:3a ] ) , we get the identity @xmath71 this example demonstrates the fact that for equivalent trees , e.g. , @xmath72and @xmath64 their effective energies differ in constant value only , with latter statement being actually an equipollent definition of the tree equivalence , @xmath73 thereby the introduced relationship between the maximal trees really form an equivalence relation because the condition @xmath74 and @xmath75 gives rise to @xmath76 . therefore the collection of all the maximal trees @xmath77 of the state graph @xmath12 can be divided in the classes @xmath78 of equivalent trees that will be called channels . the superposition of all the maximal trees belonging to one channel @xmath79 i.e. its implementation as a subgraph of graph @xmath12 will be also referred to as just the channel @xmath79 .",
    "the fact that the notion of channels does have some meaning is justified in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] exhibiting a case where there are channels contaning more then one maximal tree and not coinciding with the system as a whole .",
    "namely , this figure depicts a four state system for which there are two elementary ( three state ) cycles with zero probability flux ( cycles 1 - 3 - 4 - 1 and 2 - 3 - 4 - 2 ) and two ones with nonzero flux ( cycles 1 - 3 - 2 - 1 and 1 - 2 - 4 - 1 ) .",
    "these cycles , indeed , can have such properties , which requires some comments .",
    "the matter is that the fluxes @xmath80 and @xmath81 are not independent because the compound cycle 1 - 3 - 2 - 4 - 1 can be obtained unifying either the cycles 1 - 3 - 2 - 1 and 1 - 2 - 4 - 1 or the cycles 1 - 3 - 4 - 1 and 2 - 3 - 4 - 2 .",
    "the unification of cycles with zero probability flux inevitably gives rise to the compound cycle with zero flux too .",
    "so the fluxes @xmath80 and @xmath81 should also meet the condition of zero probability flux for the cycle 1 - 3 - 2 - 4 - 1 .",
    "the detailed analysis of the relationship between the probability fluxes of elementary and compound cycles is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "here we note only that the adopted flux pattern can be implemented for the given graph when all its edges are symmetrical with respect to the transition rate , @xmath82 , except for the edge @xmath83 , where @xmath84 .",

    "it should be noted that the obtained effective energy @xmath108 of the system states @xmath109 within the channel @xmath79 can depend on many parameters of this channel and is reduced to some fixed function @xmath110 multiplied by an inverse channel temperature , @xmath111 , in special cases only .",
    "this could take place if , for example , the distribution of the tree energies within one channel and the distribution of the system states are caused by the same mechanism . in this case",
    "it might be expected that the channel temperature will be specified by the order parameter @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 .        figure  [ fig00 ] visualizes an example of systems where differen channels , at least some ones , can be ascribed with the effective energies for the system states that differ only by some constant prefactors .",

    "however , their contribution to the steady state distribution could be rather small .",
    "the steady state probability flux @xmath122 through the graph edges can be also reduced to a sum over the channels . in order to do this",

    "it is rather similar to the widely used notion of superstatistics but , nevertheless , differs from at the basics .",
    "the key point of the developed approach is the representation of a nonequilibrium system as a superposition of its equilibrium subsystems ( channels ) with local detailed balance rather then a formal expansion of the steady state distribution into the sum over terms of the boltzmann type .",
    "our considerations shed light on the network structures of complex systems and may help to understand systems in flux equilibrium like turbulent flows , traffic flows and economic systems",
