    "since the introduction of the temperley - lieb algebra @xcite , the concept of temperley - lieb equivalence has been widely used in statistical mechanics , see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "the original motivation of this concept was the computation of physical properties of the @xmath2-states potts model on the self - dual line by a mapping to the six - vertex model .",
    "the possibility of such a mapping is interesting as the configuration spaces of the potts model and of the six - vertex model are rather different .",
    "the underlying mechanism of this mapping is of algebraic and representation theoretical type and allows for relating the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the potts - model to those of the six - vertex model .",
    "needless to say , the concept of temperley - lieb equivalence has also attracted strong attention in mathematics @xcite .    by now , there are many more models like the @xmath3-models @xcite , the graph - models @xcite and certain vertex - models @xcite which are based on representations of the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "these models allow for explicit evaluations of some of their physical properties by a mapping to the six - vertex model . also",
    ", these models are integrable in the traditional sense , because the local interactions satisfy the yang - baxter equation as a consequence of the temperley - lieb relations .",
    "the temperley - lieb equivalence naturally extends to the quantum counterparts of the above statistical mechanical models , such as the quantum @xmath3 models and quantum spin-@xmath4 chains @xcite , all of which are related to the spin-1/2 heisenberg chain with partial anisotropy ( @xmath1 chain ) .",
    "the concept of temperley - lieb equivalence has been established for systems with open boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "many physical properties do not depend on the boundary conditions if the thermodynamical limit is taken . according to the temperley - lieb equivalence , transfer matrices or hamiltonians of models based on the temperley - lieb algebra have the same spectrum ( up to degeneracies of the eigenvalues ) as the corresponding operators of the ` standard reference ' six - vertex model or the @xmath1 quantum spin chain .",
    "obviously , properties that depend on the special type of boundary conditions , like finite size - data yielding conformal dimensions , or properties that depend on multiplicities , like thermodynamics of the quantum chains , are not covered !    for some cases , notably the critical @xmath3-models and their quantum counterparts ,",
    "the entire spectrum is known , because the underlying hilbert space is lower - dimensional than in the case of the standard reference model .",
    "the @xmath3-models with periodic boundary conditions allow for an analysis based on the fusion algebra @xcite , which is rather different from a representation theoretical treatment of for instance the periodic temperley - lieb algebra @xcite .",
    "the bethe ansatz like eigenvalue equations for the @xmath3-models look like those of the @xmath1 chain with special twisted boundary conditions .",
    "the question about degeneracies of eigenvalues is simply answered with one or zero .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in a general approach utilizing representation theoretical concepts to tackle the outlined problems and we are going to apply our approach to quantum chains with higher dimensional spins . here",
    "the question about degeneracies of eigenvalues finds rather different answers than in the case of the @xmath3 models .",
    "in fact , the eigenvalues are rather highly degenerate .",
    "actually , for ferromagnetic exchange interactions , the quantum chains exhibit residual entropy , i.e.  the degeneracy of the ground - state increases exponentially with the chain length . for periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "we find bethe ansatz like equations with twist angle taking values from a much larger set than in the case of the @xmath3 models . here",
    "the twist angles comprise real and imaginary values !",
    "we believe that our results complete the studies of the spectral problem of the so - called biquadratic spin-1 chain and generalizations @xcite . despite the large number of papers devoted to the spectral problem of this model , even conscientious",
    "coordinate bethe ansatz calculations did not yet reveal the high degeneracies @xcite .    the outline of the article is as follows . in section [ tl - models ]",
    "we introduce the class of quantum spin chains we are going to address . in section",
    "[ open boundaries ] the case of open boundaries is discussed .",
    "the multiplicities of the eigenvalues are obtained using representation theory of the temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "the emphasis of this paper is on section [ periodic boundaries ] where we deal with periodic boundaries . here",
    "the determination of the multiplicities is more involved , because the spectrum is sector - wise obtained from the spectra of several @xmath1-chains with different twisted boundary conditions .",
    "we use representations of the periodic temperley - lieb algebra @xcite which are constructed from translationally invariant reference states with zero and non - zero momentum eigenvalues . for these models the physical properties of the anti - ferromagnetic ground state and a few excited states",
    "have been reported in the literature @xcite . here , we present the complete treatment of the entire spectrum , in particular for the system with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "finally , in section [ applications ] we discuss the thermodynamical properties of the biquadratic spin-1 chain which turn out to be rather different from those of the related @xmath1 chain .",

    "note , however , that in the case of the spin-1 biquadratic model , one of the rare special cases with residual entropy is realized ! unlike the @xmath0 case and many other systems , for the ferromagnetic spin-1 biquadratic model and others of sect .",
    "[ tl - models ] the ground state is exponentially degenerate !",
    "the residual entropy is @xmath405 which gives @xmath406 for dimension @xmath407",

    "this is also supported by the temperature dependence of the entropy as shown in figure  [ fig2]b ) .",
    "the value of the residual entropy for @xmath407 was derived earlier @xcite .",
    "note that in the ferromagnetic ( @xmath0 ) case , due to the larger excitation gap @xmath409 , the thermodynamically activated behaviour at low temperatures is better visible than in the antiferromagnetic case .    in figure  [ fig3 ] the susceptibility @xmath394 data are presented . for antiferromagnetic exchange coefficients ,",

    "unfortunately , for @xmath395 the true low-@xmath242 behaviour is not yet reached in the numerical treatment . on physical grounds ,",

    "we have shown how to construct the irreducible invariant subspaces ( sectors ) of temperley - lieb models in the case of open as well as periodic boundary conditions . a central step in the construction of the sectors was the identification of the one - dimensional representations of the ( open as well as periodically closed ) temperley - lieb algebra for arbitrary chain length .",
    "the one - dimensional representations are also known as bethe ansatz reference states . in the periodically closed case ,",
    "the reference states had to be translationally invariant for being compatible with the boundary conditions .",
    "the questions about the eigenvalues and multiplicities ( ! ) of the momentum operator in hilbert spaces of tensor - product type and of reduced type led to an interesting analysis with compact answer that we did not find in the literature , but think should exist already .",
    "the above findings lead to sobering insight with respect to alternative approaches like the coordinate and the algebraic bethe ansatz .",
    "the fact , that most of the reference states of the temperley - lieb models with periodic boundary conditions have non - zero momentum eigenvalues leads to the equivalence with the @xmath1 chain with twisted boundary conditions where the twist is given by the momentum value .",
    "( note that in an extreme case , also an imaginary twist angle appears ) .",
    "further , the higher spin-@xmath4 quantum chains have exponentially degenerate ground - states .",
    "this should explain the failure of attempts of direct bethe ansatz calculations @xcite to construct all eigenstates from just one standard reference state .",
    "there are two types of applications of our results .",
    "we like to point out , that the complete understanding of the spectrum of temperley - lieb systems with periodic boundary conditions allows for a study of the conformal dimensions . here",
    ", we did not follow this line of thoughts and leave it for future work .",
    "most interesting with respect to applications in the theory of the spin quantum hall effect are vertex models with super - symmetry , like @xmath410 and local @xmath411 dimensional space corresponding to @xmath412 .    as an application of the complete knowledge of multiplicities we computed the thermodynamical properties of the quantum spin chains without magnetic field by a direct mapping of the partition function to that of the @xmath1 chain .",
    "such a treatment would have been possible already on the basis of results by @xcite .",
    "interestingly , our alternative indirect approach to thermodynamics by taking a detour via a classical two - dimensional model with twisted boundary conditions allowed for a more transparent and more general treatment allowing for arbitrary , non - vanishing ( ! ) external fields .",
    "the result of these investigations is a ` temperley - lieb equivalence at finite temperature and finite field ' .",
    "the specific heat , entropy and susceptibility data of the biquadratic model were explicitly calculated for arbitrary temperature .",
    "especially the low - temperature properties are very interesting . in the ferromagnetic case",
    "the susceptibility data show large values at low temperatures .",
    "our investigations are extensive , but not complete .",
    "we hope to report elsewhere on a complete study of the low - temperature asymptotics of the quantum spin chains and on the complete treatment of the non - semisimple cases including the super - symmetric chains .",
