    "one of the most intriguing relationships in astronomy is that between the non - thermal radio and far - infrared ( fir ) emission from galaxies .",
    "it is one of the strongest correlations in astronomy , with a tight correlation between fir and radio luminosity over five decades of luminosity ( e.g. price & duric 1992 ; yun , reddy & condon 2001 ) .",
    "the relationship holds for a remarkably wide variety of galaxy types , and is observed not only globally but also on @xmath0kiloparsec scales within the disks of individual galaxies ( e.g. boulanger & prault 1988 ; bicay & helou 1990 ; fitt et al .",
    "1992 ; murphy et al .",
    "some authors also find evidence of the relationship at high redshifts ( e.g. garrett 2002 ; appleton et al .",
    "2004 ; kovcs et al .",
    "yet , although the relationship has been known for over two decades ( e.g. condon 1992 and references therein ) , the cause of the relationship is still unclear .",
    "the standard explanation of the relationship is that both the fir and radio emission are caused by high - mass stars , with the stars both heating the dust , which then emits fir emission , and producing the relativistic electrons responsible for synchrotron radiation when at the end of their lives they explode as supernovae ( see e.g. condon 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "alternative explanations have been proposed .",
    "however , most workers in the field have assumed that the standard explanation ( i.e. ongoing star - formation ) is the correct one .",
    "nevertheless , despite its widespread acceptance , there is surprisingly little direct evidence for the standard explanation and it has one major problem .",
    "the problem is that the slope of the fir ",
    "radio relation is roughly unity ( helou , soifer & rowan - robinson 1985 ; devereux & eales 1989 ) whereas the synchrotron emissivity does not just depend on the number - density of relativistic electrons but also on the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "although there are only a few measurements from zeeman splitting of the magnetic fields in galaxies ( thompson et al .",
    "2006 and references therein ) , it is possible to estimate the magnetic field in a galaxy using the ` minimum energy ' argument ( longair 1983 ) , and estimates of the magnetic field made in this way can vary by as much as a factor of 100 from normal galaxies like our own to vigorously star - forming galaxies such as arp 220 ( thompson et al .",
    "the radio spectrum of a galaxy roughly follows a power - law ( @xmath1 ) and the synchrotron emissivity is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "the radio emissivity in arp 220 will therefore be much higher than in our own galaxy , not only because of the much greater production rate of relativistic electrons per cubic kiloparsec , but also because of the stronger magnetic field .",
    "however , it is still possible to explain the unity slope of the fir ",
    "radio relation if the relativistic electrons lose all their energy within their galaxy , and thus an electron in arp 220 loses its energy at a faster rate but ultimately only loses the same amount of energy as in a galaxy like our own .",
    "this scenario is described by the ` calorimeter ' model ( vlk 1989 ; lisenfeld , vlk & xu 1996 ) , in which the dust - heating stellar uv photons and the relativistic electrons lose most of their energy within the galaxy .",
    "the calorimeter model will only give a unity slope for the fir ",
    "radio relation if the ratio of inverse compton to synchrotron losses is roughly the same in all galaxies , which leads to the prediction that the energy density of the interstellar radiation field and that of the magnetic field have a constant ratio for galaxies .",
    "lisenfeld et al .",
    "( 1996 ) used observations of 114 ` normal ' late - type galaxies to estimate the mean energy densities of the interstellar radiation field and , using the ` minimum energy ' argument , the magnetic field .",
    "they showed a linear correlation between the two , suggesting turbulent dynamo activity in galaxies as a possible explanation .",
    "calorimeter - type models have also been presented by several other authors ( e.g. pohl 1994 ) .",
    "a more fundamental problem with the calorimeter model is that the radio spectra of star - forming galaxies do not exhibit the steepening that one would expect if the electrons lose all their energy within the galaxy in which they were formed .",
    "a recent interesting suggestion has been that the magnetic fields in galaxies are actually much higher than the estimates from the minimum energy argument , which would definitely lead to an electron losing all its energy before it diffuses out of its galaxy ( thompson et al .",
    "thompson et al .",
    "explain the lack of clear curvature in the radio spectra as the result of ionization losses , which flatten the spectrum at low frequencies .",
    "an alternative idea is that the fir  radio relation holds for the ` optically thin ' scenario in which the majority of the stellar uv photons and relativistic electrons do escape from the galaxy disk ( e.g. helou & bicay 1993 ) . the fir ",
    "radio correlation is then attributed to a constant ratio between the production rates of dust - heating uv photons and synchrotron - emitting relativistic electrons .",
    "niklas & beck ( 1997 ) argue that observations do not support either the calorimeter or ` optically - thin ' model and suggest an alternative model in which the fir  radio relation arises from a combination of correlations ; that between the volume density of cool ( neutral ) gas and the star formation rate and magnetic field strength , and that between the star formation rate and the fir luminosity , assuming equipartion between the cosmic ray energy density and the magnetic field strength . in this scenario",
    "the cool neutral gas clouds play a central role .",
    "such a model , unlike either the calorimeter ( optically thick ) or optically thin models , can explain the fact that the fir ",
    "radio relation is not only observed globally but is also observed on kiloparsec scales within the disks of individual galaxies .",
    "alternative explanations have also been proposed by a number of other authors .",
    "bettens et al .",
    "( 1993 ) proposed that the cosmic ray flux , which as in the ` standard explanation ' produces the non - thermal radio emission , drives the evolution of molecular clouds ; a higher flux of cosmic rays produces a higher ionization fraction in the cloud , which delays the cloud s collapse , and ultimately leads to a larger fraction of ob stars and more fir emission from the surrounding dust .",
    "however , other authors ( e.g. niklas & beck 1997 , murgia et al . 2005 ) have pointed out problems with this model ; for example it fails to take into account the effect of the the interstellar magnetic field strength on the synchrotron luminosity .",
    "murgia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) proposed a model in which the relation between co , radio continuum and fir emission results from hydrostatic pressure in galaxies , which can explain the correlation on both global and local scales . in this model",
    "the relationship between the co and radio is explained by hydrostatic pressure acting as a regulating mechanism between the molecular gas fraction and the magnetic field strength , while the link to the fir emission comes from models by dopita et al .",
    "( 2004 ) which connect fir emission with interstellar pressure .",
    "this model thus avoids an explicit dependence on star formation .",
    "most of the various models proposed to explain the fir ",
    "radio relationship require a link between the gas density and the magnetic field strength .",
    "one suggestion as to possible physical processes behind such a model is magnetohydrodynamic turbulence ( groves et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "whatever its cause , the strong correlation between fir and radio emission in nearby galaxies provided submillimetre ( submm ) astronomers with a valuable tool for estimating the redshifts of the galaxies discovered in the first deep submm surveys ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; hughes et al . 1998 ; eales et al .",
    "these galaxies are very faint at optical wavelengths , which has made it very difficult to measure redshifts using conventional spectroscopy , and until recently very few spectroscopic redshifts existed ( chapman et al .",
    "carilli & yun ( 1999 ) first suggested that an alternative to optical spectroscopy would be to assume that the fir ",
    "radio relation is the same at all redshifts , and then estimate redshifts from the ratio of submm to radio flux densities .    in this paper",
    "we explore the fir - radio relationship at both high and low redshifts , using the results of the recently - completed scuba local universe galaxy survey ( slugs ) .",
    "this is a submm survey of @xmath3 galaxies in the local universe , half drawn from a sample selected in the fir ( dunne et al .",
    "2000b ; herein the irs sample ) and half drawn from an optically - selected ( herein os ) sample ( vlahakis , dunne & eales 2005 ) .",
    "our submm measurements allow us to test a basic prediction of the standard theory .",
    "because of the greater intensity of the interstellar radiation field in regions containing large numbers of ob stars , the dust in these regions will be hotter than the dust in the general interstellar medium .",
    "therefore , the standard hypothesis makes the prediction that the correlation between fir and radio emission will be tighter than the correlation between submm and radio emission .",
    "previous authors have found evidence both in favour of and against this prediction by decomposing the fir emission into warm and cold components ( e.g. hoernes , berkhuijsen and xu 1998 ; pierini et al .",
    "2003 ) , but this previous work was based on fir measurements alone rather than measurements at submm wavelengths . in section  [ fir - radio ]",
    "we use our slugs data to test the prediction . in section  [ indicator ]",
    "we then consider the fir ",
    "radio relationship at high redshift .",
    "because slugs is the only large sample of galaxies for which there are measured spectral energy distributions extending through the fir and submm wavebands , we can predict the ratios of radio to submm emission one would see at high redshift _ if there is no cosmic evolution in the fir  radio relationship . _",
    "dunne , clements & eales ( 2000 ) performed a similar analysis using the irs data alone . using the spectroscopic redshifts from chapman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , we show that the sources detected in deep scuba surveys are generally brighter radio sources than one would predict from the fir ",
    "radio relationship seen in the local universe .",

    "the plotted points in the diagram show all the deep scuba sources with both spectroscopic redshifts and radio measurements from chapman et al .",
    "stars indicate those which have the most robustly determined redshifts , following aretxaga et al .",
    "the fact that the os galaxies tend to have higher values of @xmath6 than the irs galaxies can clearly be seen , with about two thirds of the os curves having higher @xmath6 at a given redshift than the @xmath18 variation of the irs predictions .",
    ", width=302 ]    it is immediately evident that many of the os galaxies predict a very different @xmath6redshift relationship to the irs galaxies , with about two thirds of the os galaxies lying outside the @xmath18 variation of the irs predictions and having higher @xmath6 at a given redshift .",
    "therefore , in the absence of an independent measurement of redshift , a given source could be either irs - like and at higher redshift or os - like and at lower redshift , which is essentially the degeneracy noted by blain ( 1999 ) .",
    "when the os galaxies are included , it can be seen that the uncertainty in the carilli & yun method is much greater than would be evident from the irs curves alone . in summary",
    ", it seems that the temperature of the bulk of the dust significantly affects the position of a galaxy on the @xmath6z diagram , and that as a consequence of the differing proportions of warm and cold dust in local galaxies , which is quite clearly shown in the comparison of the two slugs samples , the carilli & yun technique is unlikely to be reliable as a redshift estimator for deep submm sources without measuring the temperature of the dust in these objects .",
    "we now turn to the measurements for the high - redshift galaxies .",
    "the main thing to note from figure  [ high - red ] is that the high - redshift sources are significantly brighter at radio wavelengths , or alternatively fainter at fir wavelengths , than the predictions for either the os or irs sample .",
    "lewis , chapman & helou ( 2005 ) find a similar result comparing their model predictions to measurements of deep submm sources .",
    "evidence that the ratio of radio to fir emission may be higher at high redshift than at low redshift has also been found by other authors ( e.g. kovcs et al .",
    "2006 , who used additional submm observations of a subset of the chapman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) sample ) .",
    "there are a four possible explanations for the difference between the chapman et al .",
    "sources and the slugs @xmath6z predictions .",
    "only one is that there is a genuine difference between the fir  radio relationships at high and low redshift .    1 .",
    "the high - redshift scuba galaxies have an average dust luminosity that is about four times greater than the most luminous slugs galaxy ( coppin et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "therefore , if there is an inverse correlation between @xmath6 and luminosity at zero redshift , our models will under - predict the radio emission of the high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we investigate this possibility in figure  [ alpha - plots ] .",
    "there is only a weak inverse correlation between @xmath6 and 850-luminosity ( figure  [ alpha-850-both ] ) .",
    "there is an inverse correlation between @xmath6 and 60-luminosity ( figure  [ alpha - s60-both ] ) , but it is unclear whether it continues at luminosities @xmath19 whz@xmath20sr@xmath20 . the discrepancy in figure  [ high - red ] between our irs predictions and the chapman et al .",
    "sources is about 0.25 in alpha , and the discrepancy is greater for the os predictions . in order for even the smaller of the discrepancies to be explained by the correlation in figure  [ alpha - s60-both ]",
    ", @xmath6 would have to decrease by approximately 0.25 over a luminosity range of a factor of @xmath214 .",
    "this seems unlikely looking at the slow change in @xmath22 , but we can not exclude the possibility .",
    "one possibility could be that the chapman et al .",
    "sources have significant agn activity contributing to their 1.4 ghz emission ( an extreme example in the local universe would be ngc6166 and the other six or so outliers in the os sample fir  radio correlation shown in figure  [ lum - radio - lor ] )  if dust is heated to higher temperatures in stronger radiation fields , e.g. near to an agn , we could expect to see both higher 1.4 ghz emission and higher dust temperature",
    ". however , it seems unlikely that the radio and fir emission from these galaxies is dominated by radiation from an active nucleus because a ) the galaxies are not generally strong x - ray sources ( waskett et al .",
    "2003 ) , b ) the radio morphologies are not those typical of radio - loud agn ( chapman et al .",
    "2004 ) , and c ) the optical spectra are often those of starbursts rather than agn ( chapman et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , we find that excluding the 18 submm galaxies which exhibit agn characteristics does not affect the result we see in figure  [ high - red ] .",
    "another possibility , which would contribute to the scatter of the chapman et al .",
    "sources in figure  [ high - red ] , is that some of the redshifts are unreliable . in order to test this",
    "we selected a subsample of the chapman et al .",
    "sources with the most robustly determined redshifts  following aretxaga et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , those whose spectroscopic redshifts are derived from the identification of at least two spectral features and which have unambiguous optical / ir / radio counterparts .",
    "we find that using this reduced sample does not affect the result we see in figure  [ high - red ] , and as such it seems unlikely that unreliable redshifts are the explanation .",
    "the fourth possibility , which we feel is most likely , is that the relationship between fir and radio emission at high redshift is different from that at low redshift . given the very different conditions in the universe ten billion years ago compared to today , it would actually be quite surprising if the relationship were the same .",
    "moreover , there is already evidence that the radio sources associated with high - redshift dust sources are quite different from those today .",
    "chapman et al . ( 2004 ) find that the majority of the high - redshift sources have larger radio sizes ( @xmath23kpc ) than are found for local ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs , @xmath24kpc ) .",
    "this would suggest that the physical conditions may be different for low and high redshift sources , in which case one might expect to see some evolution of the fir  radio relation .",
    "although the explanation of the relation between radio and fir emission at low redshift is still uncertain ( see section  [ intro ] ) , there are still some general statements one can make about the possibility of this relationship evolving with redshift .",
    "we will assume that the standard model is correct : the fir emission is from dust heated by young ob stars and the radio emission is from relativistic electrons which were produced by supernovae . within the standard model ( which invokes an explicit dependence on star formation ) , there are two explanations of the slope ( of roughly unity on a log - log plot ) of the low - redshift relationship .",
    "the first is the calorimeter model ( vlk 1989 ) . in this model ,",
    "the electrons radiate all their energy before they escape from the galaxy ; variations in the magnetic field change the rate at which an individual electron loses its energy but do not change the fir",
    " radio ratio .",
    "the second type of explanation is that the slope , which is not precisely unity , is a cosmic conspiracy . in models of this type",
    ", electrons do escape from galaxies before they radiate all their energy , which would lead to a lower fir  radio ratio in galaxies with stronger magnetic fields .",
    "however , this is avoided in the models by fine - tuning them so that , for example , electrons diffuse more rapidly out of galaxies in which the magnetic fields are stronger ( e.g. chi & wolfendale 1990 ) .",
    "other fine - tuning models include , for example , those of helou & bicay ( 1993 ) and niklas & beck ( 1997 ) .",
    "the calorimeter model seems the more natural explanation , but its disadvantage has been that the radio spectra of galaxies do not show the clear down - turn at high frequencies expected for an aging population , although thompson et al . (",
    "2006 ) have argued that this is the result of another cosmic conspiracy  of ionization and bremsstrahlung losses flattening the spectra .",
    "if the calorimeter model is correct , we would probably expect a change in the fir ",
    "radio ratio with redshift in the opposite direction to the one we actually observe . in this model , increases in the magnetic field in high - redshift galaxies , which one might expect as the result of increased turbulence in the interstellar medium , will have no affect on the fir  radio ratio .",
    "the one effect , however , that one might expect is that the electrons will lose a greater fraction of their energy to inverse compton losses , because of the increase in the energy density of the microwave background and because of the strong interstellar radiation field in these galaxies . in this case , however , we would expect the fir  radio ratio to increase with redshift because an electron is losing more of its energy by inverse compton losses than by synchrotron losses .",
    "the cosmic conspiracy models contain more free parameters and therefore lead to less definite predictions .",
    "however , since the high - redshift galaxies detected in the deep submm surveys do appear to have larger radio sizes than the ulirgs found in the local universe , one might expect the relativistic electrons to escape more slowly from the galaxies . in this case",
    ", one would expect the fir  radio ratio to decrease with redshift .",
    "this is in qualitative agreement with what we observe .",
    "therefore , our results provide some evidence against the calorimeter model .",
    "one important question is whether the slugs seds are suitable templates for the high - redshift objects in the chapman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) sample .",
    "unfortunately , for these distant submm sources there are very limited observations at wavelengths which probe the peak in the dust sed and the spectral slope in the radio regime .",
    "the current best estimates of the fir seds come from sharc-2 observations at 350 ( probing rest frame 120 at @xmath25 ) presented by kovcs et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and coppin et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "this allows a basic estimate of the dust temperature independent of assumptions about the fir - radio correlation , and these authors find an average dust temperature of @xmath26 k for submm selected galaxies  very similar to the average temperature for the slugs irs sample ( dunne et al .",
    "in this respect , the fir / submm part of the irs slugs seds are probably a sensible choice of template . in the radio , however , it is less obvious that things could be the same at both low and high redshift .",
    "for example , there are very few measurements of the radio spectral index for high - redshift submm sources .",
    "a flattening of the average spectral index compared to that for the low - redshift sources ( @xmath27 ) would tend to move the high - redshift sources in the direction observed in figure  [ high - red ] .",
    "hunt , bianchi & maiolino ( 2005 ) notice that seds appropriate for compact dwarf galaxies ( which have a higher component of free - free emission and so flatter spectral indices ) produce better photometric redshift estimators than seds based on more typical ir luminous galaxies .",
    "the reason why the high - redshift sources are generally brighter at radio wavelengths compared to our slugs @xmath6z predictions may be uncovered by deep multi - wavelength radio observations of submm sources which will investigate their radio properties , as well as better coverage of the ir sed ( e.g. from herschel ) .",
    "using the results of the os slugs sample we have investigated the relationships between fir  submm and radio properties for ` normal ' local galaxies , compared to bright galaxies ( using the irs slugs sample from dunne et al .",
    "2000b ) . the results for the os galaxies",
    "have then been used to assess the reliability of the carilli & yun ( 1999 , 2000 ) radio  submm redshift estimator technique , for the first time using a sample containing significant fractions of cold dust .",
    "we find the following results .",
    "* there is a very tight correlation between 1.4ghz luminosity and 60- luminosity for the os sample galaxies .",
    "there is much more scatter in the correlation between radio and 850luminosity , thus providing evidence that the standard explanation for the fir ",
    "radio luminosity correlation is correct and that it is the population of young ( ob ) stars which both heats the dust and provides the source of radio emission . *",
    "using the seds of the 17 os galaxies detected at both 850- and 450-we have shown that for a sample of ` normal ' galaxies there is much more scatter in the @xmath6-redshift relation than seen for the 25 most luminous galaxies of the irs slugs sample , most likely since the os objects contain large fractions of cold dust . from this",
    "we conclude that in order for the carilli & yun radio  submm redshift indicator method to be reliable as a redshift estimator for deep submm sources one would need measurements of the temperature of the dust in those objects .",
    "* we have compared our os @xmath6-redshift relations to the deep submm observations of chapman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and demonstrate that the large majority of these deep scuba sources must have very different properties to our sample of low - redshift slugs galaxies .",
    "we find that the majority of the deep scuba galaxies are brighter at radio wavelengths than any of our predictions .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that this simply reflects that our low - redshift galaxies are not suitable templates for the high - redshift scuba galaxies , but we think it more likely that this shows the fir  radio relation is evolving with redshift .",
