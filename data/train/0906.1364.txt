    "this is the third in the series of papers in which we investigate poisson geometry of directed networks . in @xcite",
    ", we studied poisson structures associated with weighted directed networks in a disk and in an annulus .",
    "the study was motivated in part by poisson properties of cluster algebras .",
    "in fact , it was shown in @xcite that if a universal poisson bracket on the space of edge weights of a directed network in a disk satisfy an analogue of the poisson ",
    "lie property with respect to concatenation , then the poisson structure induced by this bracket on the corresponding grassmannian is compatible with the cluster algebra structure in the homogeneous coordinate ring of the grassmannian . in this paper",
    "we deal with an example that ties together objects and concepts from the theory of cluster algebras and directed networks with the theory of integrable systems .",
    "integrable systems in question are the _ toda flows _ on @xmath11 .",
    "these are commuting hamiltonian flows generated by conjugation - invariant functions on @xmath11 with respect to the standard poisson  lie structure .",
    "toda flows ( also known as _",
    "characteristic hamiltonian systems _",
    "@xcite ) are defined for an arbitrary standard semi - simple poisson  lie group , but we will concentrate on the @xmath11 case , where as a maximal algebraically independent family of conjugation - invariant functions one can choose @xmath12 , @xmath13 . the equation of motion generated by @xmath14 has a _ lax form _ : [ lax_intro ] x = , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote strictly upper and lower parts of a matrix @xmath17 .",
    "any double bruhat cell @xmath7 , @xmath18 , is a regular poisson submanifold in @xmath11 invariant under the right and left multiplication by elements of the maximal torus ( the subgroup of diagonal matrices ) @xmath19 . in particular , @xmath7 is invariant under the conjugation by elements of @xmath5 .",
    "the standard poisson  lie structure is also invariant under the conjugation action of @xmath5 on @xmath11 .",
    "this means that toda flows defined by ( [ lax_intro ] ) induce commuting hamiltonian flows on @xmath20 where @xmath5 acts on @xmath7 by conjugation . in the case when @xmath21 , @xmath7 consists of tridiagonal matrices with nonzero off - diagonal entries , @xmath20 can be conveniently described as the set @xmath22 of _ jacobi matrices _ of the form [ jac ] l = (    ccccc b_1 & 1 & 0 & & 0 + a_1&b_2 & 1 & & 0 + & & & & + & & & b_n-1 & 1 + 0&&&a_n-1&b_n    ) , a_1 a_n-1 0 ,  l 0 .",
    "lax equations then become the equations of the _ finite nonperiodic toda hierarchy _ :",
    "@xmath23,\\ ] ] the first of which , corresponding to @xmath24 , is the celebrated _ toda lattice _ @xmath25 with the boundary conditions @xmath26 .",
    "recall that @xmath27 is a casimir function for the standard poisson ",
    "lie bracket .",
    "the level sets of the function @xmath27 foliate @xmath22 into @xmath28-dimensional symplectic manifolds , and the toda hierarchy defines a completely integrable system on every symplectic leaf .",
    "note that although toda flows on an arbitrary double bruhat cell @xmath7 can be exactly solved via the so - called _ factorization method _",
    "( see , e.g. @xcite ) , in most cases the dimension of symplectic leaves in @xmath20 exceeds @xmath28 , which means that conjugation - invariant functions do not form a poisson commuting family rich enough to ensure liouville complete integrability .",
    "an important role in the study of toda flows is played by the _ weyl function _",
    "@xmath29 where @xmath30 is the characteristic polynomial of @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the characteristic polynomial of the @xmath33 submatrix of @xmath31 formed by deleting the first row and column ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "differential equations that describe the evolution of @xmath34 induced by toda flows do not depend on the initial value @xmath35 and are easy to solve : though nonlinear , they are also induced by _ linear differential equations with constant coefficients _ on the space [ rat ] \\",
    "{ m ( ) =  : p = n ,   q = n-1 ,   } by the map @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath34 is invariant under the action of @xmath5 on @xmath7 by conjugation .",
    "thus we have a map from @xmath20 into the space @xmath38 in the tridiagonal case , this map , sometimes called the _",
    "moser map _ , is invertible : it is a classical result in the theory of moment problems that matrix entries of an element in @xmath22 can be restored from its weyl function @xmath34 via determinantal formulas for matrix entries of @xmath31 in terms of hankel determinants built from the coefficients of the laurent expansion of @xmath34 .",
    "these formulas go back to the work of stieltjes on continuous fractions @xcite ( see , e.g. @xcite for details ) .    in this paper , we study double bruhat cells @xmath7 that share common features with the tridiagonal case :    \\(i ) the toda hierarchy defines a completely integrable system on level sets of the determinant in @xmath39 , and    \\(ii ) the moser map @xmath40 defined in the same way as in the tridiagonal case is invertible .",
    "we will see that double bruhat cells @xmath7 associated with any pair of coxeter elements @xmath18 enjoy these properties .",
    "( recall that a coxeter element in @xmath2 is a product of @xmath41 distinct elementary transpositions . )",
    "double bruhat cells of this kind has previously appeared ( for an arbitrary simple lie group ) in in the context of integrable systems and in @xcite in connection with cluster algebras of finite type .",
    "we will call any such double bruhat cell a _ coxeter double bruhat cell_. integrable equation induced on @xmath20 by toda flows will be called _ coxeter ",
    "toda lattices_. this term was first used in in the case @xmath42 for an arbitrary simple lie group , which generalizes the _ relativistic toda lattice _ that corresponds to the choice @xmath43 in @xmath11 . in @xcite , the corresponding integrable systems for @xmath44 and an arbitrary coxeter element @xmath45 were called _",
    "elementary toda lattices_. in the latter case , @xmath39 can be described as a subset of hessenberg matrices subject to certain rank conditions on submatrices .",
    "the tridiagonal case corresponds to the choice @xmath44 , @xmath46 .",
    "since coxeter  toda flows associated with different choices of @xmath1 lead to the same evolution of the weyl function , and the corresponding moser maps are invertible , one can construct transformations between different @xmath39 that preserve the corresponding coxeter ",
    "toda flows and thus serve as _ generalized bcklund  darboux transformations _ between them .",
    "our goal is to describe these transformations from the cluster algebra point of view . to this end",
    ", we construct a cluster algebra of rank @xmath47 associated with an extension of the space ( [ rat ] ) @xmath48 ( note that @xmath49 is embedded into @xmath9 as a codimension  @xmath50 subspace . ) distinguished clusters @xmath51 in this algebra correspond to coxeter double bruhat cells , and are formed by certain collections of hankel determinants built out of coefficients of the laurent expansion of an element in @xmath9 . sequences of cluster transformations connecting these distinguished clusters are then used as the main ingredient in the construction of generalized bcklund  darboux transformations .",
    "the insight necessary to implement this construction is drawn from two sources :    \\(i ) the procedure for the inversion of the moser map , that can be viewed as a generalization of the inverse moment problem , and    \\(ii ) interpretation of functions in @xmath52 as boundary measurement functions associated with a particular kind of networks in an annulus .    before discussing the organization of the paper",
    ", we would like to make two remarks .",
    "first , birational transformations between @xmath53 and @xmath54 for two different coxeter elements @xmath55 that serve as generalized bcklund  darboux transformation between the corresponding elementary toda lattices were first studied in @xcite .",
    "second , a cluster algebra closely related to the one we considered here recently appeared in @xcite and was a subject of a detailed combinatorial study in paper @xcite , where cluster mutations along the edges of a certain subgraph of its exchange graph were shown to describe an evolution of an _",
    "@xmath56 type q - system _  a discrete evolution that arises in the analysis of the xxx - model , which is an example of a _ quantum _ integrable model . in @xcite ,",
    "solutions of the q - system are represented as hankel determinants built from coefficients of a certain generating function , that turns out to be rational and can be represented as a matrix element of a resolvent of an appropriate linear operator .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section 2",
    "we go over the necessary background information on double bruhat cells , toda flows , cluster algebras , networks and associated poisson structures .",
    "we then proceed , in section 3 , to describe a parametrization of a coxeter double bruhat cell .",
    "this is a particular case of the berenstein - fomin - zelevinsky parametrization @xcite : for a generic element @xmath31 in @xmath7 , we consider a factorization of @xmath31 into elementary bidiagonal factors consistent with the gauss factorization of @xmath31 , that is @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the diagonal matrix @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the product of @xmath41 elementary upper bidiagonal factors @xmath61 , @xmath62 , with the order of factors in the product prescribed by @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the product of @xmath41 elementary lower bidiagonal factors @xmath65 , @xmath62 , with the order of factors in the product prescribed by @xmath45 .",
    "we also give an intrinsic characterization of a double bruhat cell .",
    "elements @xmath8 are parametrized by @xmath66 and @xmath67 , @xmath62 . in section 4",
    "we show that these parameters can be restored as monomial expressions in terms of an appropriately chosen collection of hankel determinants built from the coefficients of the laurent expansion of the weyl function @xmath68 .",
    "( in @xcite , a similar inverse problem was solved for the case @xmath44 , @xmath45 arbitrary . )",
    "both the choice of hankel determinants and exponents entering monomial expressions for @xmath66 , @xmath69 are uniquely determined by the pair @xmath70 .    in section 5 ,",
    "the map @xmath71 is given a combinatorial interpretation in terms of weighted directed planar networks .",
    "to an elementary bidiagonal factorization of @xmath72 there corresponds a network @xmath0 in a square ( disk ) with @xmath73 sources located on one side of the square and @xmath73 sinks located at the opposite side , both numbered bottom to top ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . by gluing opposite sides of the square containing sinks and sources in such a way that each sink is glued to the corresponding source and adding two additional edges , one incoming and one outgoing , one obtains a weighted directed network in an annulus ( outer and inner boundary circles of the annulus are formed by the remaining two sides of the square ) .",
    "networks in an annulus were studied in @xcite .",
    "the network we just described , @xmath3 , has one sink and one source on the outer boundary of an annulus and , according to @xcite , the boundary measurement that corresponds to this network is a rational function @xmath74 in an auxiliary parameter @xmath75 . we show that @xmath76 is equal to @xmath77 times the product of weights of the incoming and outgoing edges in @xmath3 .",
    "the determinantal formulae for the inverse of the moser map are homogeneous of degree zero with respect to coefficients of the laurent expansion , therefore the same formulae applied to @xmath74 also recover @xmath69 , @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we can define a map @xmath78 in such a way that the through map @xmath79 is the identity map .    in the remainder of section 5",
    ", we use the combinatorial data determined by the pair @xmath1 ( or , in a more transparent way , by the corresponding network @xmath3 ) to construct a cluster algebra @xmath80 , with the ( slightly modified ) collection @xmath51 serving as the initial cluster .",
    "the matrix @xmath81 that determines cluster transformations for the initial cluster is closely related to the incidence matrix of the graph dual to @xmath3 . to construct @xmath82 ,",
    "we start with the poisson structure induced on boundary measurement functions by a so - called _ standard poisson bracket _ on the space of face weights associated with @xmath3 ( this bracket is a particular case of the general construction for networks in the annulus given in @xcite ) .",
    "initial cluster variables , viewed as functions on @xmath83 form a coordinate system in which this poisson structure takes a particular simple form : the poisson bracket of logarithms of any two functions in the family is constant .",
    "this allows us to follow the strategy from @xcite to construct @xmath82 as a cluster algebra compatible with this poisson bracket .",
    "we then show that @xmath82 does not depend on the choice of coxeter elements @xmath84 , that is , that for any @xmath85 , the initial seed of @xmath86 is a seed in the cluster algebra @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , the change of coordinates @xmath87 is accomplished by a sequence of cluster transformations . moreover , the ring of regular functions on @xmath52 coincides with the localization of the complex form of @xmath10 with respect to the stable variables .",
    "we complete section 5 with the discussion of the interplay between our results and those of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we provide an alternative proof for one of the main results of @xcite concerning the laurent positivity of the solutions of q - systems .    in the final section ,",
    "we interpret generalized bcklund ",
    "darboux transformations between coxeter ",
    "toda lattices corresponding to different pairs of coxeter elements in terms of the cluster algebra @xmath10 by observing that the map [ gbdasclust ] _ u , v^u,v= _",
    "u,v t_u , v^u,v _ u , v  : g^u , v / g^u,v/ , with @xmath88 being the right inverse of @xmath89 , preserves flows generated by conjugation - invariant functions and makes the diagram @xmath90^{{\\sigma}_{u , v}^{u',v'}}\\ar[dr]_{m_{u , v}}&&{g^{u',v'}/\\hh}\\ar[dl]^{m_{u',v'}}\\\\ & { \\w_n } & } } \\end{xy}\\ ] ] commutative .",
    "we obtain explicit formulas for @xmath91 and , as a nice application , present formulas that transform solution of the usual toda lattice into solutions of the relativistic one .",
    "besides , we explain how one represents generalized bcklund  darboux transformations as equivalent transformations of the network @xmath3 .",
    "finally we show that classical darboux transformations are also related to cluster algebra transformations via a formula similar to  .",
    "in this section we collect the necessary background information on double bruhat cells , toda flows and directed networks on surfaces .",
    "though notions and results that we will need on the first two subjects can be as easily stated for an arbitrary semisimple group , we will limit ourselves to the @xmath11 case .",
    "let @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 be , resp .",
    ", algebras of upper triangular , strictly upper triangular , lower triangular and strictly lower triangular matrices .",

    "we denote by @xmath5 the maximal torus ( the subgroup of diagonal matrices ) in @xmath11 .",
    "every @xmath100 can be uniquely decomposed into @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 is diagonal .",

    "a _ reduced decomposition _ of an element @xmath109 is a representation of @xmath110 as a product @xmath111 of the smallest possible length .",
    "a reduced decomposition is not unique , but the number @xmath112 depends only on @xmath110 and is called the _ length _ of @xmath110 and denoted by @xmath113 . the sequence of indices @xmath114 that corresponds to a given reduced decomposition of @xmath110 is called a _ reduced word _ for @xmath110 .",
    "the unique element of @xmath2 of maximal length ( also called _ the longest element _ of @xmath2 ) is denoted by @xmath115 .",

    "any such function @xmath155 generates a hamiltonian flow described by _ the lax equation _ [ lax ] dx / dt = .",

    "since the action preserves double bruhat cells , the standard poisson  lie structure induces a poisson structure on @xmath8 , and the toda hierarchy induces the family of commuting hamiltonian flows on @xmath8 .",
