    "twentieth century physicists produced one of the most powerful weapons on earth  @xcite and they were used twice as an actual weapon with `` results excellent . ''",

    "there is no guarantee that these countries which already possess nuclear weapons always behave humanistically .",
    "arms control negotiations may stabilize the world temporarily but , again , there is no guarantee that the long lasting peace on earth will come true in the future . we discuss in this article a rather futuristic but not necessarily impossible technology which will expose the possessors of nuclear weapons in an extreme danger in some cases .",
    "our basic idea is to use an extremely high energy neutrino beam which penetrates the earth and interacts just a few meters away from a potentially concealed nuclear weapon .",
    "the appropriate energy turns out to be about 1000  tev .",
    "this is the energy where the neutrino mean free path becomes approximately equal to the diameter of the earth .",
    "the neutrino beam produces a hadron shower and the shower hits the plutonium or the uranium in the bomb and causes fission reactions",
    ". these reactions will heat up the bomb and either melt it down or ignite the nuclear reactions if the explosives already surround the plutonium .",
    "we will calculate the intensity of the neutrino beam required and the duration of time which the whole process will take place for a given intensity .",
    "we emphasize that the whole technology is futuristic and the reason should be clear to all the accelerator experts .",
    "actually , even the simplest prototype of our proposal , i.e.  the neutrino factory of gev range needs substantial r  &  d work .",
    "we also note that a 1000  tev machine requires the accelerator circumference of the order of 1000  km with the magnets of @xmath1 which is totally ridiculous .",
    "only if we can invent a magnet which can reach almost one order of magnitude higher field than the currently available magnet , the proposal can approach the reality . even if it becomes the reality ,",
    "the cost of the construction is of the order of or more than 100  billion  us$. also we note that the power required for the operation of the machine may exceed 50  gw taking the efficiency into account .",
    "this is above the total power of great britain .",
    "this implies that no single country will be able to afford the construction of this machine and also the operation time must be strictly restricted .",

    "we are not sure what this means when the plutonium or uranium is used to ignite the hydrogen bomb .",
    "we may just break the bomb or may lead to a full explosion .",
    "the whole process takes a matter of a few minutes in the case considered in this paper although , of course , it depends on the intensity of the neutrino beam . when the bombs are stored in the form of plutonium ball separated from the explosives , what we can do is to melt them down or vapor them away .",
    "it takes substantially longer time for this process to occur .    to justify the above statements we performed a detailed simulation calculation and the part of its results",
    "is explained in this paper although the full content will be published later .",
    "after the high energy neutrino beam passes through the soil , it causes a hadron shower near the surface of the earth , and subsequently , neutrons in the shower will strike the @xmath28 core . in order to estimate the number of the incident neutrons which is large enough to make the temperature of the tnt surrounding the core increase to its ignition one , we have carried out the numerical simulations using mcnpx under the simplified conditions . as a consequence , we obtained the value of @xmath55 .",

    "we describe below a possible scenario for the whole project :    * first , we should construct a neutrino factory which could have substantially lower energy than even 1  tev .",
    "the purpose is to fully understand the properties of the neutrino including mass , mixing angles , cp violating phase , majorana property and the interactions with other particles  @xcite . *",
    "the next step is to construct a muon collider in the multi - tev energy range .",
    "the energy should be beyond 10  tev .",
    "these two steps still require a fair amount of r  &  d but we believe that they are on the straightforward extension of the currently available technology . * the third step is to construct a muon collider of more than 100  tev energy and to reach even 1000  tev .",
    "we do not have the technology yet for this kind of machine .",
    "we may need a magnet with one to two orders of magnitude higher field than the currently available one to construct a machine of a reasonable scale .",
    "a completely new approach may be necessary to make this possible .",
    "* if the third step becomes real , then the fourth step is to actually build the 1000  tev muon collider with the movable straight sections .",
    "we want to emphasize the importance of realizing the first two steps since the technology is within the reach and its contribution to the basic science is enormous .",
    "the study may even show that the neutrino interaction increases more rapidly with the energy owing to the extra - dimension as in some models  @xcite . in that case",
    "we need not go as far as 1000  tev to achieve our goal .",
    "the last two steps require tremendous amount of effort in developing the necessary technology .",
    "it is also true that fair amount of financial and human resources will have to be introduced to accomplish the last two steps .",
    "the neutrino beam could also be used to detect the nuclear bombs with much less energy and with much less intensity .",
    "the necessary technology is the detection of the fission products from a reasonable distance",
    ". it could be rather difficult if the bombs are stored in a deep underground location .",
    "another useful application of high energy neutrino beam is to the study of the inner structure of the earth  @xcite .",
    "we may not need the neutrino energy to be as high as 1000  tev in this case .",
    "the detailed study is being performed on this subject and we will describe it in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we are certainly aware of the fact that this kind of device can not only target the nuclear bombs but other kinds of weapons of mass destruction and also , unfortunately , any kind of living object including human .",
    "but we should emphasize that the device itself is not a weapon of mass destruction .",
    "the reason is as follows : the calculation in section  [ sect : roughestmtn ] and section  [ sect : simulation ] shows that it takes 1  second for this device to cover a @xmath56 with the radiation dose of @xmath57 .",
    "it takes more than a year to cover the area of @xmath58 with this value of dose per unit area .",
    "it is extremely unlikely that no measure is taken after a few minutes of exposure of this kind .",
    "moreover , as is emphasized in the introduction and also in the appendix  [ sect : acclrtrnewtch ] , the construction cost and the power required for the operation make it almost impossible for even the richest country to build and operate it all by itself .",
    "we strongly object to the ungrounded worry that this kind of device , even its downgraded version could be used by certain irresponsible organization as a weapon of mass destruction . on the contrary",
    ", we sincerely hope that our proposal will motivate and stimulate the revival of the old idea of `` world government '' which has so far been discarded as unrealistic .",
    "lastly we would like to point out that at least the first two steps described in this section have nothing to do with the weapon research .",
    "they belong to the most fundamental scientific research activities .",
    "the suitable organizational structure to perform such a research , therefore , is through the world - wide collaboration .",
    "another worry could be expressed on the neutrino hazard around the machine .",
    "it depends crucially where one builds the machine .",
    "the concrete proposal explained in appendix  [ sect : acclrtrnewtch ] has two hazardous planes and two dangerous ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) directions .",
    "`` no fly zones '' should be set to avoid these hazardous regions .",

    "finally , we obtain the mean free path of neutrino @xmath23 and that of anti - neutrino @xmath85 in a usual manner . for the purpose",
    "we first must know the number density of protons , @xmath86 , inside the earth and that of neutrons , @xmath87 .",
