    "parton distribution functions encode the nonperturbative hadronization dynamics at the amplitude level and are , therefore , of fundamental importance in qcd calculations and phenomenological applications ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "while integrated pdfs can be given an unambiguous gauge - invariant definition in terms of wilson - line operators ( gauge links ) @xcite , the analogous definition for unintegrated , i.e. , transverse - momentum dependent , pdfs may depend more critically on the details of the gauge contour . as a result , the renormalization of tmd pdfs is a more demanding task to which the present report is devoted .    indeed , in order to satisfy factorization , one can not restore gauge invariance in tmd pdfs by inserting a purely light - like wilson line joining the quark and antiquark field points directly @xcite .",
    "the reason is that the gluons emitted from the struck quark along the @xmath2 direction have rapidities that can not match those of the spectator quarks moving along the @xmath3 direction .",
    "consequently , one is forced to employ a gauge contour that comprises segments going off the light cone and joins the quark field points through infinity .",
    "recall in this context that the gauge link resums the contributions due to collinear and transverse gluons between the struck quark and the spectator remnants ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    quite recently ,",
    "belitsky , ji , and yuan @xcite ( see also @xcite ) have shown that in the light - cone gauge @xmath4 , one has to include in the definition of tmd pdfs transverse gauge links at light - cone infinity  as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : generic - tmd - pdf ] .",
    "these transverse gauge links cancel when the integration over @xmath5 is performed , so that one recovers the correct integrated pdf .",
    "moreover , it was advocated in @xcite that adopting the advanced boundary condition ( see below ) , the transverse field @xmath6 vanishes at @xmath7 reducing the transverse gauge link to unity . for that particular boundary condition ,",

    "[ fig : generic - tmd - pdf ] , is everywhere smooth .",
    "however , we have shown in @xcite by carrying out a one - loop calculation of the gluon radiative corrections to the unpolarized tmd pdf of a quark in a quark in the light - cone gauge that there are uv divergences which are neither related to the quark self energy nor are they caused by the endpoints of the line integral along the gauge contour  as one finds for the direct contour ( the `` connector '' @xcite ) . instead , the origin of these extra uv divergences can be attributed to a cusp obstruction ( denoted by the symbol @xmath10 in fig.[fig : generic - tmd - pdf ] ) in the split gauge contour at transverse light - cone infinity .",
    "the concomitant anomalous dimension after renormalization is a local footprint of the cusp and peculiar to the split contour .",
    "it turns out to coincide with the leading - order ( lo ) cusp anomalous dimension @xcite .",
    "the appearance of this extra anomalous dimension necessitates a modification of the definition of the tmd pdf in order to dispense with it .",

    "to summarize the results of this report on the renormalization of gauge - invariant tmd pdfs , the following may be said .",
    "first , we have elaborately discussed the one - loop calculation of the uv divergences of a typical tmd pdf which contains lightlike and transverse gauge links in order to fully restore gauge invariance .",
    "we found that an extra uv divergence appears , not noticed before in the literature , which is unrelated to the quark self energy and the end - point singularities of the contours .",
    "second , we showed that these divergences give rise to an anomalous dimension , which can be regarded as originating from the renormalization effect on a cusp - like junction point of the integration contours in the gauge links at light - cone infinity . at the considered one - loop order ,",
    "this anomalous dimension coincides with the universal cusp anomalous dimension of wilson - line operators and is an ingrained property of the split contours .",
    "third , in order to dispense with this anomalous - dimensions defect and recover the well - known results in a covariant gauge ( say , in the feynman gauge ) in which @xmath66 vanishes at infinity , we have proposed a modified definition of the tmd pdf .",
    "this definition includes a collins - hautmann soft counter term by means of path - ordered eikonal factors that are evaluated along a specific non - smooth contour off the light cone .",
    "this cusped contour suffices to neutralize the cusp artifact encountered in the standard definition of the tmd pdf . finally ,",
    "as we outlined in @xcite , the soft counter term can be given an interpretation akin to the `` intrinsic '' coulomb phase found by jakob and stefanis @xcite in qed .",
    "in both cases , a phase entanglement appears , ensuing either from the charged `` particle behind the moon '' ( qed ) or from the cusp - like junction point at light - cone infinity ( qcd ) .",
    "recently , collins @xcite has considered possible refinements and modifications in the definition of unintegrated parton densities that deserve further examination .",
