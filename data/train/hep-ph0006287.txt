    "the behaviour and dependence of the structure functions on the bjorken @xmath0 is among the most actively discussed subjects in the unpolarized and polarized deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "the particular role here belongs to the small @xmath0 region where asymptotical properties of the strong interactions can be studied .",
    "the characteristic property of the low-@xmath0 region is an essential contribution of nonperturbative effects @xcite and one of the possible ways to treat this region is the construction and application of models .",
    "of course , the shortcomings of any model approach to the study of this nonperturbative region is evident .",
    "however , one could hope to gain from these models an information which can not be obtained by perturbative methods ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . among possible extensions in these studies",
    "are the considerations of the geometrical features of the structure functions , i.e. the dependence of the structure functions on the transverse coordinates or the impact parameter .",
    "this subject is not new .",
    "the importance of the parton distributions in the transverse plane was stressed in @xcite and , e.g. a brief model discussion was recently given in @xcite .",
    "this work is a revised and extended version of the latter one .",
    "as it has been demonstrated @xcite the @xmath1-dependent parton distribution can be related to the fourier transform of the off - forward matrix elements of parton correlation functions in the limiting case of zero skewedness .",
    "impact parameter dependence would allow one to gain an information on the spatial distribution of the partons inside the parent hadron and the spin properties of the nonperturbative intrinsic hadron structure .",
    "the geometrical properties of structure functions play an important role under analysis of the lepton ",
    "nuclei deep ",
    "inelastic scattering and in the hard production in the heavy",
    " ion collisions .",
    "we suppose that the deep ",
    "inelastic scattering is determined by the aligned - jet mechanism @xcite and consider the @xmath1dependence of the structure functions along the lines used in @xcite .",
    "the aligned - jet mechanism is an essentially nonperturbative and allows one to relate structure functions with the discontinuities of the amplitudes of quark  hadron elastic scattering .",
    "these relations are the following @xcite @xmath2|_{t=0},\\quad \\delta q(x )   =   \\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{im}[f_3(s , t)-f_1(s , t)]|_{t=0 } , \\quad \\delta q(x )   =   \\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{im } f_2(s , t)|_{t=0}.\\ ] ] the functions @xmath3 are helicity amplitudes for the elastic quark - hadron scattering in the standard notations for the nucleon  nucleon scattering .",
    "we consider high energy limit or the region of small @xmath0 .",
    "the structure functions obtained according to the above formulas should be multiplied by the factor @xmath4  probability that such aligned  jet configuration occurs @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes @xmath5 are the corresponding fourier - bessel transforms of the functions @xmath6 .",
    "the relations eqs . ( [ def1 ] ) will be used as a starting point under definition of the structure functions which depend on impact parameter . according to these relations it is natural to give the following operational definition : @xmath7,\\quad \\delta q(x , b )   \\equiv \\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{im}[f_3(x , b)-f_1(x , b)],\\quad \\delta q(x , b )   \\equiv   \\frac{1}{2}\\mbox{im}f_2(x , b),\\ ] ] and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the integrals over @xmath1 of the corresponding @xmath1-dependent distributions , i.e. @xmath11    the functions @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 depend also on the variable @xmath15 and have simple interpretations , e.g. the function @xmath16 represent probability to find in the hadron a quark @xmath17 with fraction of its longitudinal momenta @xmath0 at the transverse distance @xmath18 from the hadron geometrical center .",
    "interpretation of the spin distributions directly follows from their definitions : they are the differences of the probabilities to find quarks in the two spin states with longitudinal or transverse directions of the quark and hadron spins .",
    "it should be noted that the unitarity plays crucial role in the direct probabilistic interpretation of the function @xmath12 . indeed due to unitarity @xmath19 .",
    "the integral @xmath8 is a quark number density which is not limited by unity and can have arbitrary non  negative value .",
    "thus , the given definition of the @xmath1dependent structure functions is self - consistent .",
    "of course , spin distributions @xmath13 and @xmath14 are not positively defined .",
    "the unitarity can be fulfilled through the @xmath20matrix representation for the helicity amplitudes of elastic quark  hadron scattering . in the impact parameter representation",
    "the expressions for the helicity amplitudes are the following @xmath21},\\quad f_2(x , b )   =   { u_2(x , b)}/{[1-iu_1(x , b)]^2}\\label{fu}\\ ] ] unitarity requires im@xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath20matrix form of unitary representation contrary to the eikonal one does not generate itself essential singularity in the complex @xmath0 plane at @xmath23 and implementation of unitarity can be performed easily .    the model which provides explicit form of helicity functions",
    "@xmath24 has been described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "a hadron consists of the constituent quarks aligned in the longitudinal direction and embedded into the nonperturbative vacuum ( condensate ) .",
    "the constituent quark appears as a quasiparticle , i.e. as current valence quark surrounded by the cloud of quark - antiquark pairs of different flavors .",
    "we refer to effective qcd approach and use the njl model @xcite as a basis .",
    "the lagrangian in addition to the four  fermion interaction @xmath25 of the original njl model includes the six ",
    "fermion @xmath26breaking term @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "transition to partonic picture is described by the introduction of a momentum cutoff @xmath28 gev , which corresponds to the scale of chiral symmetry spontaneous breaking @xcite .",
    "this picture for a hadron structure implies that overlapping and interaction of peripheral condensates in hadron collision occurs at the first stage . in the overlapping region",
    "the condensates interact and as a result virtual massive quark pairs appear . being released a part of hadron energy carried by the peripheral condensates goes to generation of massive quarks . in another words",
    "nonlinear field couplings transform kinetic energy into internal energy of dressed quarks .",
    "of course , number of such quarks fluctuates .",
    "the average number of quarks in the cosidered case is proportional to convolution of the condensate distributions @xmath29 of the colliding constituent quark and hadron : @xmath30 where the function @xmath31 is determined by a transformation thermodynamics of kinetic energy of interacting condenstates to the internal energy of massive quarks . to estimate the @xmath31 it is feasible to assume that it is proportional to the maximal possible energy dependence @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the average fraction of energy carried by the constituent quarks , @xmath34 is the mass scale of constituent quarks . in the model",
    "each of the constituent valence quarks located in the central part of the hadron is supposed to scatter in a quasi - independent way by the produced virtual quark pairs at given impact parameter and by the other valence quarks . when smeared over longitudinal momenta the scattering amplitude of constituent valence quark @xmath35",
    "may be represented in the form @xmath36\\langle v_q(b ) \\rangle,\\label{sme}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the total number of quarks in the system of the colliding constituent quark and hadron and @xmath38 is the smeared amplitude of single quark - quark scattering . in this approach",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude satisfies the unitarity since it is constructed as a solution of the following equation @xmath39 which is presented here in operator form .",
    "the function @xmath40 ( generalized reaction matrix )  the basic dynamical quantity of this approach  is then chosen as a product of the averaged quark amplitudes @xmath41 in accordance with assumed quasi - independent nature of valence quark scattering .",
    "the strong interaction radius of the constituent quark @xmath35 is determined by its compton wavelength and the @xmath1dependence of the function @xmath42 related to the quark formfactor @xmath43 has a simple form @xmath44 .",
    "the helicity flip transition , i.e. @xmath45 occurs when the valence quark knocks out a quark with the opposite helicity and the same flavor @xcite .",
    "the explicit expressions for the helicity functions @xmath24 at small @xmath0 have been obtained from the functions @xmath46 @xcite by the substitute @xmath47 and at small values of @xmath0 they are the following : @xmath48,\\quad u_2(x , b)=g_f^2(q^2)\\frac{m_q^2x}{q^2}\\exp[-2(\\alpha -1)m_qb/\\xi]u_0(x , b ) , \\label{uis}\\ ] ] where @xmath49^{n}\\exp[-mb/\\xi].\\ ] ] @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the model parameters , some of them in this particular case of quark - hadron scattering depend on the virtuality @xmath15 .",
    "the meaning of these parameters is not crucial here ; note only that @xmath55 is the average mass of constituent quarks in the quark - hadron system of @xmath37 quarks and @xmath56 is their total mass , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "we consider here for simplicity pure imaginary case .",
    "we need to keep the subleading terms in the expressions for @xmath58 and @xmath59 since the @xmath13 is determined by their difference . for @xmath60",
    "one can keep only leading term .    then using eqs .",
    "( [ fu ] ) we obtain at small @xmath0 : @xmath61 ^ 2},\\ ] ] @xmath62 \\frac{\\tilde u_0(x , b)}{[1+\\tilde u_0(x , b)]^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath63 . from the above expressions",
    "it follows that @xmath12 has a central @xmath1dependence , while @xmath13 and @xmath14 have peripheral profiles .",
    "their qualitative dependence on the impact parameter @xmath1 is depicted in fig .",
    "1 . the function @xmath13 has a maximum located at @xmath64.\\ ] ]    = 80 mm    .    from eqs.([qxb],[dqxb ] ) it follows that factorization of @xmath0 and @xmath1 dependencies is not allowed by unitarity and this provides constraints for the model parameterizations of structure functions which depend on @xmath0 and @xmath1 variables .",
    "indeed , it is clear from eqs.([qxb],[dqxb ] ) that factorized form of the input `` amplitude '' @xmath65 can not survive after unitarization due to the presence of the denominators .",
    "it is to be noted here that from the relation of impact parameter distributions with the off - forward parton distributions @xcite it follows that the same conclusion on the absence of factorization is also valid for the off - forward parton distributions with zero skewedness .",
    "the following relation between the structure functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 can also be inferred from the above model - based formulas @xmath66 thus , the function @xmath14 which describes transverse spin distribution is suppressed by the factors @xmath67 and @xmath68 , i.e. it has a more central profile .",
    "this suppression also reduces double - spin transverse asymmetries in the central region in the drell - yan production compared to the corresponding longitudinal asymmetries .",
    "the strange quark structure functions have also a more central @xmath1dependence than in the case of @xmath69 and @xmath70 quarks .",
    "the radius of the corresponding quark matter distribution follows from eq .",
    "( [ dqxb ] ) and is the following @xmath71 while the ratio of the strange quark distributions to the light quark distributions radii is given by the corresponding constituent quark masses , i.e. for the nucleon this ratio would be @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "time reversal invariance of strong interactions allows one to write down relations similar to eqs.([def1 ] ) for the fragmentation functions also and obtain expressions for the fragmentation functions @xmath74",
    ", @xmath75 , @xmath76 which have just the same dependence on the impact parameter @xmath1 as the corresponding structure functions .",
    "the fragmentation function @xmath77 is the probability for fragmentation of quark @xmath17 at transverse distance @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) into a hadron @xmath80 which carry the fraction @xmath81 of the quark momentum . in this case",
    "@xmath1 is a transverse distance between quark @xmath17 and the center of the hadron @xmath80 .",
    "it is positively defined and due to unitarity obey to the inequality @xmath82 .",
    "the physical interpretations of spin  dependent fragmentation functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 is similar to that of corresponding spin structure function .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spin structure functions have a peripheral dependence on the impact parameter contrary to central profile of the unpolarized structure function .",
    "it could be related to the orbital angular momentum of quarks inside the constituent quark .",
    "the important point what the origin of this orbital angular momenta is .",
    "it was proposed @xcite to use an analogy with an anisotropic extension of the theory of superconductivity which seems to match well with the picture for a constituent quark .",
    "the studies @xcite of that theory show that the presence of anisotropy leads to axial symmetry of pairing correlations around the anisotropy direction @xmath85 and to the particle currents induced by the pairing correlations . in another words",
    "it means that a particle of the condensed fluid is surrounded by a cloud of correlated particles which rotate around it with the axis of rotation @xmath86 .",
    "calculation of the orbital momentum shows that it is proportional to the density of the correlated particles .",
    "thus , it is clear that there is a direct analogy between this picture and that describing the constituent quark .",
    "an axis of anisotropy @xmath86 can be associated with the polarization vector of current valence quark located at the origin of the constituent quark .",
    "the orbital angular momentum @xmath87 lies along @xmath86 .",
    "spin of constituent quark , e.g. @xmath20-quark , in the model used is given by the sum : @xmath88 in principle , @xmath89 and @xmath90 can include contribution of gluon angular momentum , however , since we consider effective lagrangian approach where gluon degrees of freedom are overintegrated , we do not concern problems of the separation and mixing of the quark angular momentum and gluon effects in qcd ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in the njl  model @xcite the six - quark fermion operator simulates the effect of gluon operator @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the gluon field tensor in qcd .",
    "it is worth to note here that in general large gluon orbital angular momentum is expected to be almost canceled by gluon spin contribution @xcite .",
    "the value of the orbital momentum contribution into the spin of constituent quark can be estimated according to the relation between contributions of current quarks into a proton spin and corresponding contributions of current quarks into a spin of the constituent quarks and that of the constituent quarks into proton spin @xcite : @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "the value of @xmath95 was measured in the deep ",
    "inelastic scattering .",
    "thus , on the grounds of the experimental data for polarized dis we arrive to conclusion that the significant part of the spin of constituent quark in the model should be associated with the orbital angular momentum of the current quarks inside the constituent one @xcite .",
    "then the peripherality of the spin structure functions can be correlated with the large contribution of the orbital angular momentum , i.e. with the quarks coherent rotation .",
    "indeed , there is a compensation between the total spin of the quark - antiquark cloud and its orbital angular momenta , i.e. @xmath96 and therefore this correlation follows if the above compensation has a local nature and valid for a fixed impact parameter .",
    "the important role of orbital angular momentum was known long before emc discovery @xcite and reappeared after as one of the transparent explanations of the polarized deep - inelastic scattering data @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd calculations in the quenched approximation also indicate significant quark orbital angular momentum contribution to spin of a nucleon @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to find out possible experimental signatures of the peripheral geometrical profiles of the spin structure functions and the significant role of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "one of such indications could be an observation of the different spatial distributions of charge and magnetization at jefferson lab @xcite .",
    "it would also be important to have a precise data for the strange formfactor .",
