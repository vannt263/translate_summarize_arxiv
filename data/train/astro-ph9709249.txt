    "strong refraction by interstellar electron density irregularities has been invoked to explain several radio astronomical phenomena .",
    "fiedler et al .",
    "( 1987 , 1994a ) and clegg , fey , & fiedler  ( 1996 ) reported a number of extreme scattering events ( eses)dramatic changes in the 2.25  ghz flux density  in the light curves of several extragalactic radio sources observed during the course of a 2.25 and  8.1  ghz monitoring program .",
    "the changes typically lasted several weeks or months and were occasionally accompanied by strong variations at 8.1  ghz . because of the simultaneity of the events at different wavelengths , the time scales of the events , and speed - of - light travel time arguments , fiedler et al .",
    "( 1987 ) and romani , blandford , & cordes  ( 1987 ) concluded that the flux density variations were likely due to strong scattering by the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) . a similar dramatic change in the flux density , and times of arrival , has since been observed during a timing program of the pulsar psr  b1937@xmath121 ( @xcite ) .",
    "interstellar refraction may also be responsible for episodes of multiple imaging and fringing observed in various pulsars dynamic spectra ( hewish , wolszczan , & graham  1985 ; @xcite ; gupta , rickett , & lyne  1988 ; clegg , fiedler , & cordes  1993 ) .",
    "dynamic spectra record the flux density of the pulsar as a function of time and frequency .",
    "because a pulsar is an angularly compact coherent emitter , strong interstellar refraction may produce multiple images of the pulsar .",
    "the multiple pulsar images can then interfere with one another , producing fringes in the time and frequency domains which are visible in the dynamic spectra as alternating bright and dark bands modulating the diffractive scintillation pattern of the pulsar .",
    "the characteristics of the medium responsible for strong interstellar refraction are not clear .",
    "for example , it is unknown if the refraction responsible for such phenomena as eses and fringing in pulsar dynamic spectra is the result of a localized large - amplitude electron density enhancement ( a `` plasma lens '' ) located somewhere between the observer and source , or whether the refraction is the result of an extended turbulent medium with a large number of electron density fluctuations distributed along the line of sight .",
    "there are arguments that favor both models : clegg , chernoff , & cordes  ( 1988 ) showed that expanding shock fronts can naturally create discrete plasma lenses , while the general ism is widely believed to have an extended , turbulent distribution of electron density fluctuations ( @xcite ) .    to date , refraction phenomena which have been interpreted in terms of the discrete lens model",
    "have been analyzed using back - of - the - envelope calculations for the effects of the lens ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these calculations have been useful for deriving approximate characteristics of the background radio source and the lens itself .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to venture beyond the back - of - the - envelope calculations and to present a detailed , quantitative description of the optics properties of an interstellar plasma lens .",

    "an observer in this region would see a source of decreased brightness due to the lower number density of rays .",

    "two of the three images merge on the caustic surface . in reality , the brightness of the image is limited by diffraction effects which are not taken into account here .",
    "now assume that an observer , due to relative transverse motion of the lens , travels at a constant ( large ) distance  @xmath34 from the lens plane .",

    "for instance , when @xmath114 the on - axis gain is 0.039 , only 2% larger than the gain @xmath103 predicted by a point source .",
    "when the source is much bigger than the lens the result of refraction is to produce a ripple in the light curve rather than strong modulations .",
    "rays from the outer edges of the source are refracted into the defocusing region so the minimum intensity is not as deep as for a point source .",
    "note that the height of the ripple and the true effects on the caustic spikes of an extended source can not be quantitatively determined without a simulation that also includes diffraction effects .",
    "we have performed limited diffraction simulations and can say that the refractive light curves are correct in a qualitative sense .",

    "if @xmath209 , the focusing of ray bundles will become strong enough for ray paths to cross , and multiple imaging of the background source will occur . for the case of a gaussian lens profile , an observer located within a region of multiple imaging can see as many as three images of the background source , each with a different brightness and appearing to come from slightly different directions",
    ". the total brightness of the source , obtained by adding the brightness of the multiple images , will be greater than the nominal brightness of the source .    separating the multiple imaging regions from the single image regions are caustic surfaces , on which two of the three multiple images blend together and , in the limit of geometrical optics , the observed brightness of the background source grows without bound .",
    "an observer passing from a single - image region through the multiple imaging regions and back to a single - image region can use the observed position of the caustics to determine the magnitude of the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the separation between the _ inner _ caustics can also be used to constrain the diameter of the lens .",
    "the primary effect of increasing the angular size of the background source in relation to the angular size of the lens , i.e. , increasing @xmath68 , is to smooth out the light curve and reduce the observed amplitudes of maximum and minimum intensity .",
    "we have generated sample light curves from our model and compared them to extreme scattering events observed towards the extragalactic sources 0954@xmath1658 ,  [ sec:0954 + 658 ] , and 1741@xmath2038 , ",

    "we have far more difficulty recreating the 8.1  ghz light curves by utilizing only the appropriate wavelength scalings for @xmath0 and @xmath68 .",
    "the discrepancies between the modelled and observed light curves may result from some combination of substructure within the lens , an anisotropic lens shape , a lens which only grazes the source rather than passing completely over it , or unresolved substructure within the extragalactic sources .    for 0954@xmath1658 we find it to be strongly lensed at 2.25  ghz . interpreting the light curve for this source is difficult because of uncertainties about the source s structure at the time of the .",
    "we favor an interpretation in which the lens passed over a component in the source s jet .",
    "the lens toward this source is probably associated with radio loop  iii so that the lens was 0.15  kpc distant .",
    "the peak column density in the lens was 0.24  pc  @xmath3 , its size was 0.38  au , the electron density within the lens is @xmath5  @xmath3 , and its mass was @xmath6  m@xmath7 .",
    "the lens also caused the source s position to wander by as much as 250  mas at 2.25  ghz , an easily detectable amount using phase - referenced vlbi observations or by measuring the relative positions between source components .",
    "for 1741@xmath2038 , the ese was caused by a weak lens .",
    "the lens toward this source is likely to be associated with radio loop  i and at a distance of 0.13  kpc .",

    ". an angular displacement of this magnitude would not have been detectable for 1741@xmath2038 ; many other sources that have undergone eses have more complicated structures than 1741@xmath2038 , however , and relative position shifts of this magnitude between lensed and unlensed components might be detectable in those sources .",

    "if we assume the plasma temperature within the lenses to be @xmath127  k , the pressure within the lenses is @xmath212@xmath213  k  @xmath3 .",
