    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) are two intriguing classes of isolated neutron stars , very likely magnetars , whose bright x - ray emission is powered by the decay of their strong magnetic fields . when the common nature of axps and sgrs was first proposed by thompson & duncan ( 1996 ) with both being magnetars , the observational evidence linking them was tenuous .",
    "a major advance in connecting these two classes came when slow pulsations and rapid spin down , defining characteristics of axps , were discovered from sgr  1806@xmath420 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 ) . since then",
    ", further observational similarities among axps and sgrs have been established .",
    "for example , marsden & white ( 2001 ) performed a systematic analysis of sgr and axp spectral data that showed the two classes form a continuum in spectral hardness versus spin - down rate where the sgrs have harder spectra and faster spin - down rates than the spectrally softer , slower braking axps .",
    "similarly , the timing noise strength in sgrs and axps appears to be correlated with spin - down rate ( woods et al .",
    "2000 ; gavriil & kaspi 2002 ) . for",
    "a review of sgrs and axps , see kouveliotou ( 2003 ) and mereghetti et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , respectively . until recently , the most prominent characteristic distinguishing the two groups was the emission of soft , bright ( up to 10@xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 ) bursts of soft gamma - rays from the sgrs and _ not _ the axps .",
    "in fact , it was this extraordinary property of sgrs which led to doubt within the community that axps and sgrs were of the same nature .",
    "this uncertainty was removed when sgr - like bursts were recently discovered from at least one axp ( kaspi et al.2003 ) , and probably one other ( gavriil , kaspi & woods 2002 ) .",
    "sgr - like bursts from the direction of an axp were first detected from the source 1e  1048.1@xmath45937 ( gavriil , kaspi & woods 2002 ) .",
    "a single weak sgr - like burst was detected during each of two _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ proportional counter array ( pca ) monitoring observations of this axp separated by two weeks .",
    "however , the identification of 1e  1048.1@xmath45937 as the burst source could not be made unambiguously due to the lack of imaging capability with the pca .",
    "interestingly , the quiescent properties of this axp ( e.g.energy spectrum , pulse profile , timing noise ) most closely resemble those of the sgrs ( kaspi et al .",
    "2001 ) , making this axp the most sgr - like of its class .",
    "the second detection of sgr - like bursts was recorded from the axp 1e  2259@xmath0586 on 2002 june 18 .",
    "this is the least sgr - like of the axps in terms of its quiescent source properties .",
    "unlike the two weak bursts observed earlier from 1e  1048.1@xmath45937 , this axp showed a major sgr - like outburst , or collection of bursts ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ) . in total ,",
    "more than 80 bursts were detected within 3 hours of observing time .",
    "a detailed study of these bursts will be presented in a companion paper ( gavriil et al .",
    "in addition to emitting these hard x - ray bursts , several parameters of the persistent source changed in conjunction with this outburst , thereby confirming the axp as the source of the burst emission ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ) .    here , we present _ x - ray multi - mirror mission ( xmm - newton ) _ and _ rxte _ pca observations of the persistent x - ray flux from 1e  2259@xmath0586 before , during and after the 2002 june outburst .",
    "we quantify the changes of the spectral and temporal properties of the x - ray source as well as the time scales for their recovery .",
    "we compare the changes observed in this axp to dynamic behavior seen in the persistent emission of sgr  1900@xmath014 ( woods et al .",
    "2001 ) and sgr  1627@xmath441 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "2003 ) during episodes of intense burst activity .",
    "finally , we present a possible explanation for the observed behavior in 1e  2259@xmath0586 within the context of the magnetar model .",
    "the results presented in this section were obtained from observations of 1e  2259@xmath0586 with the telescopes aboard the _ xmm - newton _ observatory ( jansen et al .",
    "this observatory is comprised of three co - aligned x - ray telescopes .",
    "the focal plane instruments are one epic pn camera ( strder et al .",
    "2001 ) and two epic mos cameras ( turner et al .",
    "all instruments are sensitive to x - rays between 0.2 and 15.0 kev .",
    "the pn camera has an effective area of @xmath11400 @xmath7 at 1.5 kev while the mos cameras each have areas of @xmath1500 @xmath7 at 1.5 kev .",
    "the focused x - ray beam for the telescopes serving each mos camera is split between the focal plane instrument and the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs [ den herder et al .",
    "2001 ] ) .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ observatory observed 1e  2259@xmath0586 five times during 2002 .",
    "three pointings were focused on different portions of ctb  109 , the snr surrounding 1e  2259@xmath0586 .",
    "the primary scientific objective of the remaining two observations was the central point source . in each of the three ctb  109 pointings ,",

    "one possibility is that the response of the persistent x - ray flux to ( or when accompanied by ) burst activity in sgrs and axps varies within the group . alternatively ( or in addition ) , there may be two components to the sgr flux decay similar to the axp flux evolution and the values listed in table 6 for the sgrs reflect a mixture of the two components which contributes to the quantitative differences with the axp values .",
    "in fact , the flux from sgr  1900@xmath014 in the months following the end of the 40 day afterglow was enhanced relative to the pre - outburst level ( woods et al .",
    "this enhancement could be due to the persistent , low - level burst activity observed during this time interval or perhaps due to a slower flux decay component , analagous to the slow flux decay seen in 1e  2259@xmath0586 .",
    "unfortunately , there are no reported spectral measurements of sgr  1900@xmath014 during this epoch to help distinguish between the two possibilities . for sgr  1627@xmath441 , the initial follow - up observation was not performed until @xmath150 days after the primary outburst ( woods et al .",
    "1999a ) , therefore , any short - lived transient flux decay would have been missed .",
    "thus , it appears that two flux components may possibly be present in all sgr / axp outbursts .",
    "more rigorous follow - up spectral measurements after future outbursts are needed to show whether or not this behavior is ubiquitous .",
    "sgr  1900@xmath014 has shown one clear instance of a correlated change in the pulse profile and pulsed fraction following the burst of 1998 august 29 ( lenters et al .",
    "2002 ) . here",
    ", the pulsed fraction increased to a maximum value of @xmath120% at @xmath1200 s following the burst , then rapidly decayed back to the pre - burst value of @xmath112% within 10@xmath13 s. during the first @xmath1100 s , the pulse shape showed large changes relative to the pre - burst profile , and similar to the pulsed fraction recovery , recovered fully ( within the errors ) during the next 10@xmath13 s. in 1e  2259@xmath0586 , we observe comparable changes in both the pulse shape and pulsed fraction at early times ( @xmath146 days ) during the outburst .",
    "however , the time scale is significantly longer for 1e  2259@xmath0586 and the pulsed fraction decreased rather than increased .",
    "the x - ray pulse profile of sgr  1900@xmath014 changed from a complex , multi - peaked shape before the giant flare of 1998 august 27 to a simple , nearly sinusoidal profile following the flare ( woods et al .",
    "this change has persisted for years following the outburst and has yet to recover ( g et al .",
    "the constraints on any change in pulsed fraction in sgr  1900@xmath014 following this flare are weak , as the first reported pulsed fraction measurement was made at 19 days following the flare , consistent with the pre - flare value ( woods et al .",
    "2001 ) . in 1e  2259@xmath0586",
    ", there was a significant change in the pulse profile in which the power in the fundamental frequency increased relative to the higher harmonics , analogous to what was observed in sgr  1900@xmath014 .",
    "the difference in pulse shape from before to during / following the burst activity was not as profound as the change seen in sgr  1900@xmath014 , however , the burst activity in 1e  2259@xmath0586 was not nearly as energetic either . note also that the change in pulse profile of 1e  2259@xmath0586 was transient as the pulse shape at one year following the outburst is very similar to the pre - outburst pulse profile .      in spite of the quantitave differences mentioned above , many of the features of the outburst in 1e  2259@xmath0586 are qualitatively very similar to those seen in sgr outbursts  specifically , the flux enhancement , spectral change , and correlated change in pulse properties .",
    "the similarities outlined above further solidify the connection between sgrs and axps .",
    "combined with the similar burst characteristics ( gavriil et al .",
    "2003 ) , this outburst in 1e  2259@xmath0586 shows beyond any reasonable doubt that sgrs and axps are of the same nature , as predicted uniquely by the magnetar model .    during the rapid initial flux decay ,",
    "the blackbody radius was smaller ( @xmath11 km ) than at all other times and the temperature was higher ( 0.8@xmath41.7 kev ) .",
    "the thermal component of the spectrum suggests the existence of a hot spot that is either cooling through its surface or is being heated by energetic particles accelerated in the magnetosphere .",
    "a localized hot spot will clearly result in a change in the emitted radiation pattern ( i.e.  pulse profile ) even if the pulse shape is strongly modified by scattering in the magnetosphere ( thompson , lyutikov , & kulkarni 2002 ) .",
    "the reduction in pulsed fraction suggests that the heated region is offset in angle from the locations on ( or above ) the stellar surface that give rise to the two pulse maxima .",
    "these observations do not allow us to distinguish convincingly between magnetospheric emission , and passive cooling of an impulsively heated crust , as the underlying source of the transient x - ray emission .",
    "the rapid flux decay could have a very different time scaling from what is observed following intermediate energy bursts in sgr  1900@xmath014 , and any change in the magnetic field of 1e  2259@xmath0586 may have occured too gradually to generate a bright x - ray outburst .",
    "a large current density will be excited in the magnetosphere above regions of strong crustal shear , but the mechanism by which this current is damped depends on how rapidly it is excited ( thompson & duncan 2001 ) .",
    "the rapid flux decay as measured is consistent with a gradually diminishing creep within a small region of the crust over a period of @xmath15 s.    it is also worth considering whether this part of the x - ray transient is the direct aftermath of a more energetic burst .",
    "the short - lived afterglows detected after sgr bursts of intermediate energy have a simple explanation as the cooling of a pair - rich surface layer heated by a high - energy burst ( ibrahim et al .",
    "2001 ) , and as such are valuable probes of the burst mechanism .",
    "as estimated above , the minimum energy of such a burst is @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ergs , where @xmath18 is afterglow energy divided by the burst energy .",
    "konus data ( s.  golenetskii , private communication ) sets an upper bound of @xmath19 ergs for bursts with duration less than 3 s and @xmath19 ( @xmath20/3 s)@xmath21 ergs for bursts with duration @xmath22 s. therefore , a much higher afterglow efficiency is required for 1e  2259@xmath0586 than is inferred for the intermediate and giant sgr  1900@xmath014 flares .",
    "is there any evidence for such extended energy release during sgr outbursts ?",
    "sgr  1900@xmath014 has , in fact , been observed to radiate the same energy over time scales ranging from @xmath23 s in the declining tail of the august 27 flare ( feroci et al .",
    "2001 ) , down to @xmath24 sec in the august 29 burst that followed it .",
    "thus , the putative burst from 1e  2259@xmath0586 would necessarily have a much longer duration than any ( of an equivalent energy ) yet observed from an sgr .",
    "although the magnetospheric opacity scales as @xmath25 and is expected to be lower in 1e 2259@xmath0586 than in the actively bursting sgrs , the luminosity of a passively cooling , trapped fireball would almost certainly exceed the bound derived from konus ( e.g. for @xmath26 ) .",
    "we now comment on the relative importance of crustal heating and enhanced magnetospheric emission for the slow decay component of the outburst of 1e  2259@xmath0586 .",
    "bulk heating of the crust of a magnetar can power an excess heat flux from its surface for a year or longer , and has been proposed as the explanation for the quasi - power - law flux decay seen in sgr  1900@xmath014 ( lyubarsky , eichler & thompson 2002 ) and sgr  1627@xmath441 ( kouveliotou et al.2003 ) . in each case , an initial energy deposition of 10@xmath5 ergs was assumed . for sgr  1900@xmath014 , there was in fact a giant flare preceding the flux enhancement that emitted @xmath110@xmath5 ergs in soft gamma - rays . for sgr  1627@xmath441 ,",
    "the burst energy output was more than one order of magnitude less , so it was suggested that the process that generates the burst energy was much less efficient in this source ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "as discussed previously , the relative energy released in burst and excess persistent emission remains very uncertain in the case of 1e  2259@xmath0586 .",
    "still , the excess persistent energy output in the slow decay component ( 2 @xmath27 10@xmath28 ergs ) was only a factor 10 lower than the output from the two sgrs , yet there was not a _ single _ burst detected with an isotropic luminosity above @xmath11 @xmath27 10@xmath29 ergs s@xmath6 during this outburst .",
    "thus , if we ascribe the slow flux decay seen in these three sources to deep heating of the crust of a magnetar , then it follows that 1e  2259@xmath0586 is almost certainly less efficient in producing burst emission than either of the other two sgrs .",
    "note also that the similarity in the time scales for the relaxation of the torque and the x - ray pulse profile must be coincidental if the slow decay component of the x - ray emission is powered by crustal cooling .",
    "a small twist of the stellar crust , as is hypothesized to explain the glitch characteristics (  4.2.4 ) , will impart a twist in the field lines that are anchored to this patch of crust .",
    "this drives a current along these twisted field lines which ultimately produces x - ray emission whose luminosity is proportional to the twist angle ( thompson et al .",
    "2000 ; thompson et al.2002 ) .",
    "however , following a twisting motion of the crust and external magnetic field through an angle @xmath30 , at most a fraction @xmath31 of the energy released is stored in the external non - potential magnetic field .",
    "( here @xmath32 is the maximum strain that the crust can sustain before yielding . )",
    "the majority of the energy is dissipated through the deformation of the crust itself , because the shear modulus at the base of the crust corresponds to a much stronger magnetic field , @xmath33 g. the amplitude of the required global twist ( about @xmath34 radians ) will only slightly change the optical depth to resonant cyclotron scattering , or the external torque through a flaring out of the external dipole field ( thompson et al .",
    "hence , this can not explain the large shape changes seen in the pulse profile within the first week following the glitch .",
    "it is possible , however , that the more subtle pulse profile changes seen more than one week post - glitch can be explained as a slight change in optical depth due to a twisting of ( likely extended ) field lines .",
    "the torque is more sensitive to a current localized on the most extended field lines , as is discussed in  4.2.5 .",
    "the timing data clearly show that a large spin - up glitch occurred in 1e  2259@xmath0586 coincident with or perhaps shortly before the onset of burst activity .",
    "a portion of the frequency jump ( @xmath120% ) recovered in a quasi - exponential manner within the next @xmath160 days .",
    "the long - term timing in the year following the glitch shows a significant reduction in the spin - down rate of this pulsar .",
    "below , we draw comparisons between the characteristics of the 1e  2259@xmath0586 glitch with those of other neutron stars and offer possible explanations for the observed behavior in 1e  2259@xmath0586 .      a conservative bound on the change in rotational energy is obtained by treating the star as a rotating solid body . for a star having moment of inertia",
    "@xmath35 g @xmath36 , one infers a change in the rotational energy of @xmath37 ergs , some two orders of magnitude smaller than the integrated excess x - ray emission .",
    "if the glitch involves an exchange of angular momentum between a superfluid with moment of inertia @xmath38 , and the crust of the star with moment of inertia @xmath39 , then the release of rotational energy is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the equilibrium lag between the rotation frequency of the superfluid and crust . evaluating this lag using the observed @xmath42-d post - glitch relaxation time ,",
    "one finds a value for @xmath43 that is smaller by a factor @xmath44 .",
    "thus the rotation of the star is manifestly not the source of energy for the transient x - ray emission .",
    "the relaxation of elastic strains in the stellar crust is another possible source of energy .",
    "the magnitude @xmath45 of these strains could easily exceed the equilibrium rotational bulge of the star , @xmath46 .",
    "however , the energy stored in the strained crust is @xmath47 ergs .",
    "the magnitude of the strain must , by way of comparison , be smaller than @xmath48 in the precessing pulsar psr  b1828@xmath411 ( cutler , ushomirsky , and link 2003 ) , whose spin is an order of magnitude faster than that of 1e 2259@xmath0586 .",
    "we conclude that the observed x - ray transient could be powered by the release of elastic energy only if departure from spherical shape in the crust were comparable to that of a neutron star with a @xmath42 ms spin period .",
    "the remaining possiblity is that the transient x - ray emission is powered by magnetic field decay .",
    "the energy carried by the ( exterior ) magnetic field of 1e 2259@xmath0586 is comfortably larger : @xmath49 ergs in the simplest case of a centered dipole .",
    "this is clearly a lower bound to the total magnetic energy of the star , as it does not account for the internal ( e.g. toroidal ) field .",
    "the surface field ( and magnetic energy ) would also be significantly stronger , by a factor @xmath50 , if the dipole moment were offset from the center of the star ( with a separation @xmath51 between the magnetic poles ) .",
    "it is interesting to compare the 1e  2259@xmath0586  glitch with those reported for a different axp , 1rxs  1708@xmath44009 .",
    "this axp has shown two glitches , one in 1999 ( kaspi , lackey & chakrabarty 2000 ) and one in 2001 ( kaspi & gavriil 2003 ; dallosso et al .",
    "the first glitch was similar to those seen in the vela and other radio pulsars ; it showed a step @xmath52 with @xmath53 , and @xmath54% , such that the magnitude of the spin - down increased .",
    "the 2001 glitch , however , was markedly different , and in some ways resembled the glitch seen in 1e  2259@xmath0586 .",
    "specifically , it showed @xmath55 , which completely recovered exponentially on a time scale of 50  days ( i.e.  @xmath56 ) . whether it suffered a step in @xmath57 depends on the interpretation of an apparent @xmath58 detected between glitches ; this is discussed in more detail by kaspi & gavriil ( 2003 ) and dallosso et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . as argued by kaspi & gavriil ( 2003 )",
    ", this glitch may have indicated that 1rxs  1708@xmath44009 underwent bursting activity some time in the few week interval between monitoring observations that straddled the glitch epoch , but which went unobserved .",
    "however , no flux or pulse profile changes comparable to those seen for 1e  2259@xmath0586 still weeks after its outburst were seen for 1rxs  1708@xmath44009 .",
    "thus , any radiative changes would have had to decay on shorter time scales than seen in 1e  2259@xmath0586 , and in particular on shorter time scales than the exponential glitch relaxation time scale .",
    "this must be kept in mind when considering the coincidence in time scales of the 1e  2259@xmath0586 rotational exponential decay and the average pulse profile s relaxation to its pre - outburst morphology .      from pulse frequency measurements leading up to and following the august 27 flare",
    ", it was determined that sgr  1900@xmath014 likely underwent rapid spin _ down _ ( @xmath59 ) at or near the time of the flare ( woods et al .",
    "an analysis of the pulsations during the flare itself ( palmer 2002 ) confirmed the existence of a timing anomaly , but only an upper limit on the time scale for the frequency change was measured ( @xmath141 day ) . for 1e  2259@xmath0586 , we detect a sudden increase in the rotation rate , as opposed to a decrease , in addition to a much smaller magnitude as that inferred for sgr  1900@xmath014 . in general , the available limits on glitches ( of either sign ) in sgrs are poor .",
    "this is a result of fewer and less extensive phase coherent timing solutions for these sources due to their strong timing noise ( woods et al .",
    "2002 ) and weaker pulsed signals relative to most axps . given the observational limitations for monitoring glitch activity in the sgrs , it is not clear whether the glitch that accompanied the outburst in 1e  2259@xmath0586 is common to sgr outbursts .",
    "although there are not any lengthy phase coherent solutions bridging the boundary between quiescent and burst active states in sgrs to allow for identification of glitches , there are sufficient observations during and following a few outbursts to search for transient changes in spin - down rate . during the first two months following the outburst of 1e  2259@xmath0586 , the frequency derivative may have changed sign ( assuming the pulse shape changes did not affect our phase measurements , see  3.1 ) then rapidly switched back to spin down with a higher magnitude compared to pre - outburst .",
    "the average spin - down rate during the first two months after the glitch in 1e  2259@xmath0586 was approximately double the pre - outburst value .",
    "similar behavior has not been seen during or following sgr outbursts .",
    "the fairly well sampled frequency histories of two sgrs ( 1900@xmath014 and 1806@xmath420 ) show that there is no direct correlation between burst activity and enhancements in the spin - down rate during or shortly following the outburst ( woods et al .",
    "in fact , the spin - down rate of sgr  1900@xmath014 in the @xmath140 days following the 1998 august 27 flare was at its lowest ( in magnitude ) historical value ( woods et al.1999b , 2002 ) .      in radio pulsars , post - glitch relaxation is almost always observed , and can be classified into two regimes : one in which the initial frequency jump relaxes exponentially relatively quickly ( i.e.  time scales of hours to weeks ) , and one in which the frequency jump does not relax , and which is generally accompanied by a permanent or very slowly ( time scales of years ) relaxing increase in the magnitude of the frequency derivative .",
    "many radio pulsar glitches show both such behaviors ( e.g. shemar & lyne 1996 , wang et al .",
    "these are today generally interpreted in terms of vortex creep theory , in which the glitches are due to sudden unpinning of angular momentum vortices in the neutron star crustal superfluid ( anderson & itoh 1975 ) .",
    "the latter , in the model , rotates faster than the crust , but in equilibrium is loosely coupled to it via pinning of vortices to crustal lattice sites . in this picture , the vortices creep outward slowly due to thermal activation ( alpar et al .  1984a , b ) , slowly transferring angular momentum to the crust . in equilibrium ,",
    "the crust , slowed down by the external torque of magnetic braking , shares an identical spin - down rate with the superfluid , in spite of a non - zero angular velocity differential between them .",
    "vortex creep theory identifies the two observational post - glitch relaxation regimes with different pinning regions ( alpar et al .",
    "1989 , 1993 ) : the exponential relaxation is associated with superfluid regions with temperatures high compared to pinning energies , so that equilibrium can be established with only a small angular velocity lag . this linear regime relaxation is mathematically equivalent to the original two - component model for the crust - superfluid interaction suggested by baym et al .",
    "( 1969 ) which did not incorporate the more recent vortex pinning theory .",
    "when the temperature is low compared to the pinning energy , a large lag is needed to establish equilibrium ; this is the non - linear regime and may be responsible for the longer - timescale relaxations of spin - down rate enhancements .    for 1e  2259@xmath0586 ,",
    "qualitatively , we detect both such classical glitch behaviors as well .",
    "however , quantitatively , the post - glitch relaxation of 1e  2259@xmath0586  is very different from that seen in radio pulsars . specifically , the exponential decay time is longer than what is observed in most pulsar glitches , and the @xmath60 value , the fraction of the glitch that heals , is also large by pulsar standards , though neither value is extreme .",
    "what is extreme is the combination : the net effect is that the pulsar , at one month post - glitch , spins down for a couple weeks with more than _ double _ its long - term pre - outburst spin - down rate . in radio pulsars ,",
    "the spin - down enhancement is typically a few percent , nearly two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "this is because the spin - down enhancement is due to a temporarily reduced moment of inertia , as a linear component of the crustal neutron superfluid re - establishes equilibrium , and this superfluid has at most a few percent of the moment of inertia of the crust . as discussed by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , a spin - down enhancement of order unity would imply that _ half _ of the stellar moment of inertia was effectively decoupled from the crust following the glitch , much more than ought to be present in the crustal superfluid .",
    "indeed the crust itself has a relatively small moment of inertia compared to the core , which is thought to be coupled to the crust on short time scales ( alpar , langer & sauls 1984 ; alpar & sauls 1988 ) .",
    "hence , the post - glitch relaxation of 1e  2259@xmath0586  could imply a core decoupling .",
    "this would provide the best evidence yet for the existence of core superfluid .",
    "however , the observed post - glitch relaxation can be understood in terms of conventional crustal superfluid if it is assumed that the superfluid / crust angular velocity lag temporarily _ reversed _ at the time of the glitch ( as was noted by alpar , pines , & cheng 1990 in the case of the 1988 christmas glitch of the vela pulsar ) .",
    "the standard two - component theory has as equations of motion for the crust ( including everything coupled to it on short time scales ) , and superfluid : @xmath61 and @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the external torque on the crust and @xmath64 is the crust - superfluid energy dissipation rate . the dissipation rate can be estimated from the post - glitch exponential recovery time scale . from these equations , it follows that the change in the crustal angular frequency derivative is given by @xmath65 or @xmath66    for @xmath67 days , @xmath68 and @xmath69  rad  s@xmath70 , we find @xmath71  rad  s@xmath6 .",
    "since @xmath72 and @xmath73  rad  s@xmath6 , we have that @xmath74  rad  s@xmath6 . as the lag was initially small and @xmath75  rad  s@xmath6",
    ", this implies the superfluid angular velocity changed by only a part in 200,000 .",
    "however , this change was about twice the observed change in the crust .",
    "thus , at the time of the glitch , in this picture , the superfluid was temporarily spun down twice as much as the crust spun up .",
    "the observed enhanced spin - down post - glitch is then due to the crust transferring angular momentum back _ to _ the superfluid , as the latter attempts to arrange its vortices so as to re - establish equilibrium .",
    "the overall activity in glitches is a measure of the moment of inertia of the internal flywheel which gives up angular momentum during glitch events ( link , epstein & lattimer 1999 ) .",
    "the activity parameter is obtained by summing over all glitches measured over a long time interval @xmath76 .",
    "if the frequency lag between the superfluid and the star is sourced only by the external torque , then one has @xmath77 in the case of 1e 2259 + 586 , we estimate @xmath78 over an interval of @xmath79 yrs ( the last outburst of 1e  2259@xmath0586 being estimated to have occured 10 years earlier [ iwasawa et al .",
    "1992 ] ; see also  4.3 ) .",
    "the resulting activity parameter is @xmath80 , several times larger than what is measured in glitching radio pulsars ( link et al .",
    "either @xmath38 is proportionately larger , or the spin rate of the superfluid is being reduced by some mechanism other than vortex line unpinning and thermal creep .",
    "for example , smooth deformations of the stellar crust , driven by magnetic stresses , can have the latter effect ( thompson et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a variety of models have been proposed to explain the origin of glitches in radio pulsars . in most models ,",
    "the rotational lag between the superfluid and the crust is the principle source of free energy .",
    "the frequency lag may , as a result , decrease in magnitude during the glitch  but it is more difficult to reverse its sign . for example , ruderman ( 1991 ) suggested that the tension of the superfluid vortices would fracture the crust , thereby allowing an outward shift in the positions of the vortices .",
    "link and epstein ( 1996 ) noted that any deposition of heat ( of the order of @xmath81 ergs in the deep crust ) would accelerate the creep rate of the pinned vortex lines , thereby causing a transient spin down of the superfluid , and a spin up of the rest of the star .",
    "our observation of enhanced x - ray emission from 1e  2259@xmath0586 is , indeed , consistent with this level of heat deposition in the crust .",
    "but it appears that this can not be the entire mechanism responsible for the observed glitch , because the vortex creep rate goes to zero as the spin rate of the superfluid approaches that of the crustal lattice .    in a slowly rotating neutron star ,",
    "magnetic stresses can act on time scales much shorter than the external torque .",
    "glitch - like events will result either from sudden fractures of the crust ( thompson & duncan 1993 ) ; or from more gradual plastic deformations during which the vortices remain pinned ( thompson et al .",
    "the lowest energy deformations of this type are torsional .",
    "consider , for example , a twisting motion of a circular patch of the crust that is offset in azimuth from the rotation axis .",
    "starting from a uniform distribution , more vortices are advected outward than inward ( due to the curvature of the stellar surface ) .",
    "a twist of the order of @xmath82 radians is enough to provide the required spin down of the crustal superfluid in 1e  2259@xmath0586 ( eq . [ 12 ] of thompson et al .",
    "2000 ) . by forcing the superfluid to rotate more slowly than it otherwise would",
    ", this mechanism also provides an explanation for the unusually large glitch activity that we inferred for 1e  2259@xmath0586 ( see also heyl & hernquist 1999 ) .    finally , as noted by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the spin - down rate enhancement could also be due to a magnetospheric restructuring which causes the external torque to approximately double .",
    "however , given that the spin up itself is inescapably enabled by an internal transfer of angular momentum , it would have to be a suprising coincidence that the external torque change offset , to within a factor of 4 - 5 , the internally generated frequency jump .",
    "this of course does not preclude some magnetospheric restructuring ; indeed the residual pulse profile change following the initial rapid flux decay and the post - outburst infrared enhancement ( kaspi et al .",
    "2003 ) suggest that likely occured .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that a magnetospheric restructuring is the cause of the enhanced spin down just post - outburst .",
    "our glitch fitting clearly measured a long - term post - glitch change in the spin - down rate .",
    "interestingly , unlike that seen in a number of radio pulsars to date , the magnitude of the spin - down torque _",
    "decreased_. ( in the case of the crab pulsar , for example , the cumulative effect of the torque changes observed following some glitches is to increase the rate of spin - down by 0.07% over 23  yr of observations [ lyne , et al .",
    "if due to a superfluid effect , the conventionally observed long - term increase in magnitude of @xmath83 represents a reduction in the moment of inertia of the part of the neutron star that is coupled to its crust .",
    "this suggests that some fraction of the crustal superfluid is tightly pinned not creeping outward , hence decoupled from the stellar spin - down ( alpar et al .",
    "1994 ) , with this fraction increasing at the glitch .",
    "the opposite must therefore be true of 1e  2259@xmath0586 in this scenario .",
    "it has alternatively been suggested that the effect is due to a secular change in the magnetic moment ( ruderman 1991 ) ; or to a change in the electromagnetic torque acting on the star , driven by a reorientation of the magnetic moment with respect to the angular velocity of the star ( link & epstein 1997 ) .",
    "we now comment on the relative merits of a change in internal vs.  external torque in the case of 1e  2259@xmath0586 .",
    "the sign of the torque change is interesting , because there is independent evidence that the spin - down torque of 1e  2259@xmath0586 has decayed over time : its characteristic age , @xmath84 yrs , is an order of magnitude greater than that of the snr ctb  109 ( estimated radius 12 pc ; kothes et al .",
    "a change in vortex creep rate with a time scale @xmath64 much longer than 1 yr , but much less than the characteristic age @xmath85 yrs , would appear as a permanent change in braking torque .",
    "the required moment of inertia of the superfluid component would be @xmath86  comfortably below the fraction inferred for glitching radio pulsars ( link , epstein & lattimer 1999 ) unless the creep time scale were more than a million times longer than the observed 15 day relaxation .",
    "the simplest explanation for the required change is the external torque  a @xmath87% reduction in the magnetic moment  can be discounted .",
    "if , for example , the external magnetic field of 1e  2259@xmath0586 were a centered dipole , the total field energy outside the star would amount to some @xmath88 ergs , and the reduction in field energy would be a few hundred times larger that the excess x - ray emission we have observed .",
    "nonetheless , changes in external torque can result from more subtle effects .",
    "if the magnetosphere is globally twisted due to the action of internal magnetic stresses , the resulting expansion of the poloidal field lines increases the current crossing the speed of light cylinder , and therefore yields a greater torque than would exist from a simple dipolar field rotating in a vacuum ( thompson et al .",
    "much of this effect results from the closed field lines which extend far from the star to a large radius @xmath89 , are anchored in a small fraction @xmath90 of its surface area , and which contain only a small fraction @xmath91 of the energy in the non - potential ( toroidal ) field outside the star .",
    "a slight relaxation in the twist of the closed field lines is therefore consistent with the observed energetic output following the glitch , if that reconfiguration occurs close to the magnetic poles .",
    "persistent seismic activity in a magnetar will also modulate the spin - down torque , through a coupling of crustal shear waves to the magnetosphere which in turns drives a particle wind ( thompson & blaes 1998 ; harding , contopoulos & kazanas 1999 ; thompson et al .",
    "2000 ) . in this case ,",
    "the observed change in torque corresponds to a very small reduction in the particle luminosity , by only @xmath92 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "finally , a change in torque could result from the excitation of precession during the glitch , followed by a permanent reorientation of the magnetic axis relative to the rotation axis of the star ( link & epstein 1997 ) .",
    "that would require a precession angle of at least a few degrees , which is uncomfortably large if the non - spherical shape of the star is predominantly due to its magnetic field .",
    "the fractional difference in the sizes of the principal moments is @xmath93 $ ] ( wasserman 2003 ) .",
    "however , the observed energy of the x - ray transient corresponds to less than @xmath94 of the total magnetic energy of the star (  4.2.1 ) and , thus , to a proportionately small change in the shape of the star .      as suggested by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , past reports of flux variability ( iwasawa et al .  1992 ; baykal & swank 1996 ) , pulse profile changes ( iwasawa et al.1992 ) , and glitch activity ( heyl & hernquist 1999 ) in 1e  2259@xmath0586 likely indicate previous episodes of burst activity in this source .",
    "the best example of an inferred outburst from 1e  2259@xmath0586 comes from a pair of _ ginga _ observations in 1989 and 1990 . between 1989 and 1990 ,",
    "the pulse profile of 1e  2259@xmath0586 changed drastically , the flux increased by more than a factor 2 , and the measured frequency showed evidence of a glitch .",
    "the close similarities with the well studied outburst of 2002 june strongly suggests that a bursting episode from 1e  2259@xmath0586 preceded the 1990 _ ginga _ observation by roughly one week .",
    "similar reports of flux variability and timing anomalies in the axp 1e  1048.1@xmath45937 ( e.g.  oosterbroek et al .",
    "1998 ) suggests past episodes of burst activity in this source as well .",
    "what is most intruiging about the detected and inferred outbursts in axps is that none has been detected with large fov gamma - ray detectors ( e.g.  batse , konus , ulysses , etc . )",
    "that traditionally detect burst active episodes in sgrs .",
    "this shows that we are missing low intensity sgr - like outbursts from magnetar candidates in our galaxy ( i.e.  the sgrs are a sensitivity limited sample ) .",
    "the number of active sgrs in our galaxy was calculated previously to be @xmath110 ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "a key assumption that was made in this estimation was that sgr outbursts are easily detected ( i.e.  there are always bright bursts within a given outburst that would trigger at least some of the large fov gamma - ray instruments ) .",
    "the discovery of low - intensity sgr - like outbursts in axps clearly invalidates that assumption , making the estimate of 10 a lower limit only .",
    "the future prospects for detecting weak sgr - like outbursts and addressing the question of the number of active sgrs in our galaxy is promising .",
    "up until 2000 june , batse was the most sensitive large fov detector for sgr burst emissions",
    ". the impending _ swift _ mission and its sensitive bat detector will be @xmath120 times more sensitive than batse was ( d.  band , private communication ) . just as the _ rxte _ pca opened our eyes to the larger population of low - luminosity sgr bursts ( e.g.  g et al.1999 ) , perhaps _ swift _",
    "will reveal a previously unknown source population of dimmer sgrs .",
    "in 2002 june , the axp 1e  2259@xmath0586 was observed to emit more than 80 sgr - like bursts . accompanying this outburst were several changes in the persistent x - ray emission properties of the source , many of which are similar to what has been seen in sgrs , thus further blurring the distinction between the two classes .",
    "we have quantified the observed changes using data obtained with _ xmm - newton _ and _ rxte_. in particular , we found the following :    * the flux increased by more than an order of magnitude and showed two decay components .",
    "the first component decayed rapidly within the first day of the outburst while the second decayed much more slowly as a power law in time according to @xmath95 . * the x - ray spectrum hardened during the outburst , but almost fully recovered within three days .",
    "the spectrum at 21 days past the burst activity was significantly harder than at 7 days pre - outburst , but fully consistent with historical spectral measurements of this source in quiescence . * the phase dependence of the energy spectrum changed from before to after the outburst .",
    "one week prior to the outburst , we observe significant variablility in the photon index , but not the blackbody temperature .",
    "three days following the outburst , the dependence of the photon index on pulse phase flattened significantly . *",
    "the pulse profile changed suddenly during the observation containing the burst activity where much of the power moved to the fundamental frequency .",
    "the pulse profile rapidly returned to near its pre - outburst shape within one week , and showed only very slow recovery thereafter .",
    "as with the flux and spectral changes , the recovery was not complete even after one year .",
    "* the pulsed fraction decreased during the outburst to @xmath115% , but quickly recovered to the pre - outburst value of @xmath123% within six days . *",
    "1e  2259@xmath0586 suffered a glitch having an ordinary amplitude ( @xmath96 ) , but a unique recovery .",
    "approximately 19% of the glitch recovered on a time scale of @xmath116 days , although the recovery was not exactly exponential in form . during the recovery ,",
    "the torque was enhanced relative to the pre - outburst value by a factor @xmath12 .",
    "we detect a long - term @xmath12% _ reduction _ in the spin - down rate following the glitch ( @xmath97 hz s@xmath6 ) . *",
    "the measured glitch epoch preceedes the observed burst activity by @xmath112 hours .",
    "given the rapid flux decay during the outburst , the true onset of this burst activity may have followed the glitch .    the cumulative properties of the outburst in 1e  2259@xmath0586",
    "lead us to conclude that the star suffered some major event that was extended in time and had two components , one tightly localized on the surface of the star ( i.e.  a fracture or a series of fractures ) and the second more broadly distributed ( possibly involving a smoother plastic change ) .",
    "this event affected both the superfluid interior and the magnetosphere .",
    "the glitch points toward a disturbance within the superfluid interior while the extended flux enhancement and pulse profile change suggests an excitation of magnetospheric currents and crustal heating . finally , we show that the lack of detection of axp outbursts with all - sky gamma - ray detectors suggests there exists a larger population of active sgrs in our galaxy than previously thought .",
