    "effect of chemical reactions on turbulent transport is of great importance in many applications ranging from atmospheric turbulence and transport of pollutants to combustion processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . even without turbulence ,",
    "the combustion is an intrinsically complex process with chemical kinetic mechanism which may involve hundreds species and up to thousands chemical reactions . in most technological applications ( e.g. spark - ignition engines , industrial burners , furnaces etc . )",
    "combustion nearly always occurs within a turbulent rather than a laminar flow .",
    "when a flame propagates in a turbulent flow , turbulence enhances mixing of fuel and oxidizer and therefore enhances combustion .",
    "the combustion heat in turn generates flow instabilities and affects the turbulence and turbulent transport .",
    "it has been noticed @xcite that the latter can manifest themselves in a form of the so - called counter - gradient scalar transport , i.e. a flux of products from unburnt to burnt regions of a premixed flame . in its turn , the counter - gradient transport can substantially reduce the flame speed @xcite .",
    "thus , understanding the turbulent transport in chemically reacting flows is of great importance for calculations of the turbulent flame speed and plays a key role in the premixed turbulent combustion .",
    "however , besides a few studies @xcite , the vast majority of available models of the influence of combustion on turbulent transport @xcite are focused solely on effects that stem from density variations , i.e. , neglecting straightforward influence of chemical reactions on turbulent fluxes @xcite .",
    "the effect of chemical reactions on turbulent diffusion of chemically reacting gaseous admixtures in a developed turbulence has been studied analytically using a path - integral approach for a delta - correlated in time random velocity field @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon also has been recently investigated applying the spectral - tau approach that is valid for large reynolds and peclet numbers @xcite .",
    "these studies have demonstrated that turbulent diffusion of the reacting species can be strongly suppressed by a large factor ( of the order of the turbulent damkhler number , @xmath3 , that is a ratio of turbulent , @xmath4 , and chemical , @xmath5 , time scales ) .",
    "the dependence of turbulent diffusion coefficient , @xmath6 , versus the turbulent damkhler number obtained theoretically in @xcite , was validated using results of mean - field simulations of a reactive front propagating in a turbulent flow @xcite . in these simulations , the mean speed , @xmath7 , of the planar one - dimensional reactive front was determined using numerical solution of the kolmogorov - petrovskii - piskunov ( kpp ) equation @xcite or the fisher equation @xcite .",
    "this equation was extended in @xcite to take into account memory effects of turbulent diffusion when the turbulent time was much larger than the characteristic chemical time .",
    "turbulent diffusion coefficients as a function of @xmath1 were determined numerically in @xcite using the obtained function @xmath8 and invoking the well - known kpp expression , @xmath9 .",
    "the theoretical dependence @xmath10 derived in @xcite was in a good agreement with the numerical results of @xcite .",
    "the goal of the present study is to further validate the theory of the turbulent diffusion of chemically reacting flows developed in @xcite , by comparing its predictions with the three - dimensional direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of the reaction wave propagating in a homogeneous isotropic and incompressible turbulence for a wide range of ratios of the wave speed to the r.m.s .",
