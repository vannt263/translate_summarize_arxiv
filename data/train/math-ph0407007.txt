    "the bogoliubov - kubo - mori ( @xmath3 ) metric is a distinguished element among the monotone metrics which are the quantum analogue of fisher information on the quantum state space ( @xcite ) . in a definite sense @xmath3 metric is the geometry on the state space that is related to von neumann entropy ( say umegaki relative entropy ) .",
    "other well - known elements of this family are the right logarithmic derivative ( @xmath4 ) metric , the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( @xmath5 or bures ) metric and the wigner - yanase - dyson ( @xmath6 ) metrics . in @xcite petz made a conjecture on the scalar curvature of the @xmath3 metric .",
    "many arguments and numerical calculations suggest that the conjecture is true ; nevertheless a complete proof is still missing ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one can state this conjecture in the following way : the @xmath3 scalar curvature is a quantitative measure of symmetry ( like entropy ) , namely it is increasing under mixing .",
    "let us emphasize that it is also possible to relate the conjecture to quantities with direct physical meaning .",
    "an equivalent formulation , still due to petz @xcite , is that `` ... the scalar curvature is an increasing function of the temperature ... '' moreover the asymptotic relation between volume and curvature in riemannian geometry and jeffrey s approach to priors in statistics induced petz to interpret the scalar curvature as the average statistical uncertainty ( that should increase under coarse graining , see @xcite ) .",
    "the original motivations given by petz for the conjecture rely on the truth of the @xmath7 case and on some numerical results for the general case .",
    "petz and sudar observed in @xcite that `` ... monotonicity of kubo metric is not surprising because this result is a kind of reformulation of lieb convexity theorem @xcite .",
    "however the monotonicity of the scalar curvature seems to be an inequality of new type ( provided the conjecture is really true ) ... '' .",

    "\\1 ) we want to look at `` higher mathematics from an elementary point of view '' .",
    "this means that we want to furnish an elementary motivation for the petz conjecture .",
    "we do this by studying the monotonicity of the curvature for @xmath0-geometries in the plane .",
    "the results obtained in this case are very intuitive if one looks at the unit sphere of the @xmath8 spaces .",
    "we conjecture that a similar behavior occurs for @xmath0-geometries in higher dimensions and in the non - commutative case too .",
    "\\2 ) on the basis of the results of point 1 ) we make a conjecture about the monotonicity of scalar curvature for the @xmath6 metrics .",
    "further we show that , using a continuity argument , this @xmath6-conjecture would imply the petz conjecture as a limit case ( theorem [ mainresult ] ) .",
    "\\3 ) we review what is known about monotonicity of scalar curvature for quantum fisher information .",
    "in particular we emphasize a result on bures metric , due to dittmann , according to which the scalar curvature , in this case , is neither schur - increasing nor schur - decreasing ( see section [ majorization ] for precise definitions ) .",
    "this implies that an example of a monotone metric for which the scalar curvature ( or its opposite ) is strictly increasing under mixing does not exist yet .",
    "note that andai ( using an integral decomposition of @xcite ) proved that also in the @xmath9 case there exist monotone metrics whose scalar curvature is not monotone @xcite .",
    "finally let us note that , related to this area , there exist other interesting papers .",
