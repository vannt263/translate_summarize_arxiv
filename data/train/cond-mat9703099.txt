    "to understand the effects of static substrate disorder on periodic media such as vortex lattices @xcite is of paramount importance both for the technological applications of high-@xmath2 materials and from a purely theoretical point of vue .",
    "such a study also applies to many other physical problems such as charge density waves ( cdw ) , wigner crystals , colloids , magnetic bubbles .    for the vortex",
    "lattices it is generally agreed that disorder leads to a glass state with diverging barriers and pinning @xcite . although the precise nature of the glass state has been the subject of much debate , most theories agreed on the absence of translational order .",
    "general arguments also tended to prove that disorder would always favor the presence of dislocations @xcite .",
    "many points were not naturally fitting in the framework of these theories such as the existence of a first order transition @xcite , decoration experiments of showing remarkably large regions free of dislocations @xcite . on the side of theory , scaling arguments @xcite suggested , within a purely elastic decription , a slower , logarithmic , growth of deformations .    in a recent work",
    "we have obtained the first quantitative theory of the elastic vortex lattice @xcite in presence of point disorder @xcite .",
    "contrarily to previous approaches , it provides a description valid at * all scales * and demonstrates that while disorder produces algebraic growth of displacements at short length scales , periodicity takes over at large scales and results in a decay of translational order _ at most algebraic_. moreover we showed @xcite using energy arguments that dislocations are _ not favorable _ for weak disorder in @xmath0 .",
    "this implies the existence of a * thermodynamic * glass phase , as far as energy and very low current transport properties are concerned , retaining a * nearly perfect * ( i.e. algebraic ) translational order and thus bragg peaks : the `` bragg glass '' . because it retains a `` lattice '' structure and bragg peaks , this glass phase is radically different from the vortex glass picture .",
    "we proposed @xcite that the phase seen experimentally at low fields was the bragg glass , solving the apparent impossibility of a pinned solid .",
    "this accounted naturally for the first - order transition and the decoration experiments .",
    "our prediction @xcite received subsequent further support both from numerical @xcite or analytical @xcite calculations .    upon raising the field , or equivalently increasing the disorder ,",
    "the bragg glass should disappear by spontaneous generation of dislocations , when the translational length @xmath3 ( the length for which relative displacements become of order of the lattice spacing @xmath4 ) is of the order of @xmath4 .",
    "the critical point occuring on the melting line @xcite was the end point of the transition line between the bragg glass at low fields and a topologically disordered glassy phase ( or a strongly pinned liquid ) at higher field .",
    "the topology of the phase diagram proposed in @xcite is as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "several recent experiments can be interpreted to confirm the picture proposed in @xcite .",
    "neutron experiments can be naturally interpreted in term of the bragg glass @xcite . in bscco neutron peaks",
    "are observed at low fields and disappear upon raising the field @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of bscco @xcite is also compatible with of our theory , the second magnetization peak line corresponding to the predicted field driven transition .",
    "a numerical estimate @xcite of the melting field @xmath5 for biscco gives @xmath6 in good agreement with the observed experimental values @xcite .",
    "this line is found to be relatively temperature independent at lower temperatures and to be shifted downwards upon increase of point disorder @xcite .",
    "similar types of phase diagrams are also observed in a variety of materials , including ybco , organic superconductors and heavy fermion compounds .",
    "more experimental consequences and references can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us now turn to the dynamics of the driven system .",
    "it is crucial to determine how much of the glassy properties remain , and how translational and topological order behave @xcite . indeed",
    "several experiments suggest that a fast moving lattice is more ordered than a static one @xcite .",
    "arguments @xcite based on large velocity expansion @xcite concluded that at low @xmath7 and above a certain velocity the moving lattice is a crystal at an effective temperature @xmath8 , with bounded displacements and no glassy properties .",
    "we showed @xcite that in fact the perturbation theory @xcite breaks down , even at large @xmath9 .",
    "some modes of the disorder are not affected by the motion and the periodic structure driven along @xmath10 experiences a transverse * static * pinning force @xmath11 , perpendicular to the direction of motion . @xmath12 where the random potential has correlations @xmath13 of range @xmath14 .",
    "this force originates only from the periodicity along @xmath15 and the uniform density modes along @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it leads to a * moving glass * ( mg ) .",
    "we analyse here this result more quantitatively , using a functional rg to study the equation of motion .",
    "we only quote here the rg equation for the disorder term , for the periodic structure at @xmath16 ( for the complete calculation see @xcite ) @xmath17 where a factor @xmath18 , with @xmath19 has been absorbed in @xmath20 ( chosen to be of period @xmath21 ) . for",
    "@xmath22 disorder renormalizes to zero and the moving system is a crystal . for @xmath23",
    "@xmath24 flows to a new fixed point @xmath25 , showing that the static disorder is still relevant in the moving structure ( with the same conclusion in @xmath0,@xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath26 grows unboundedly as @xmath27 which indicates the existence of a random force along the @xmath15 direction , generated under renormalization .",
    "a similar force is generated along @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this does not spoil the above fixed point , since one can always separates @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this has several consequences .",
    "in particular , for @xmath30 the system remains a glass and motion occurs through elastic channels , as shown on figure  [ channels ] .",
    "they are the easiest paths where particle follow each other in their motion .",
    "they form a manifold of elastically coupled , almost parallel lines or sheets ( for vortex lines in @xmath0 ) directed along @xmath10 and characterized by some transverse wandering @xmath31 . in the laboratory frame",
    "they are determined by the static disorder and do not fluctuate with time .",
    "such channels were subsequently observed in numerical simulations @xcite and in recent decoration in motion experiments @xcite . in @xmath0",
    "diplacements only grow logarithmicaly , so the mg conserves quasi - long range translational order .",
    "thus similarly to the statics , the mg in @xmath0 at weak disorder or large velocity is expected to retain perfect topological order .",
    "this leads to the @xmath32 phase diagram of figure  [ ftdiag ] .    in @xmath1",
    "however displacements grow algebraically and dislocations are likely to appear .",
    "the existence of channels @xcite then _ naturally _ suggests a scenario by which dislocations affect the mg : when the periodicity along @xmath10 is retained , e.g. , presumably in @xmath0 at weak disorder , the channels are coupled along @xmath10 . upon increasing disorder or decreasing velocity in @xmath0 , or in @xmath1 ,",
    "decoupling between channels can occur , reminiscent of static decoupling in a layered geometry @xcite .",
    "dislocations are then inserted between the layers , naturally leading to a flowing smectic glassy state , recently observed in @xmath1 numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "indeed , the transverse smectic order is likely to be more stable than topological order along x , because of particle conservation @xcite .    as an important consequence of the existence of the mg ,",
    "barriers for transverse motion exist once the pattern of channels is established .",
    "thus the response to an additional small transverse force @xmath33 is very non linear with activated behaviour . at @xmath16 and neglecting the dynamic part of the disorder a true transverse critical current @xmath34 exists .",
    "this pinning force can directly be obtained from the rg equation ( [ shortequ ] ) .",
    "since its fixed point has a _ non analycity _ at @xmath35 , ( leading to @xmath36 ) there is a critical force , determined at the larkin length @xmath37 : @xmath38 ( [ critforce ] ) coincides with the more qualitative derivation consisting in balancing the pinning energy with the transverse lorentz force acting on a larkin domain @xcite . unlike in the @xmath39 case ,",
    "the critical force does not kill the random force in the frg equation .",
    "the mg is dominated by the competition between the random force and the critical force .",
    "these predictions can be tested in experiments on the vortex lattice , or other systems such as colloids , magnetic bubbles or cdw , or or numerical simulations .",
    "additional physical consequences and references can be found in @xcite ."
