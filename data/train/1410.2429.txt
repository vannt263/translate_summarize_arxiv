    "the theory of @xmath0-invariants was created out of an effort by atiyah to extend the index theorem for elliptic operators on compact manifolds to certain noncompact situations . in a ground - breaking paper  @xcite",
    ", he proposed a _",
    "@xmath1-index _ for elliptic differential operators on an infinite galois cover @xmath2 of a compact manifold @xmath3 which combined analysis of operators over a fundamental domain for the action of the group of deck transformations @xmath1 , identified with an open dense subset of @xmath3 , with analysis on the hilbert space of sequences @xmath4 .",
    "this machinery , applied to the operator @xmath5 on the manifold @xmath2 with a cocompact @xmath1-invariant riemannian metric , leads to invariants @xmath6 or @xmath7 which generalize the rank of @xmath0-cohomology groups of finite covers ; it can be used to great advantage in cases where the @xmath0-cohomology of the covering space is an infinitely generated vector space .",
    "@xmath0-betti numbers _ are obtained as murray  von neumann ( or renormalized ) dimensions  @xcite of certain hilbert @xmath8-modules , where @xmath9 is the von neumann algebra associated to the discrete group @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if @xmath10 is an @xmath11-torus ( the setting for classical fourier analysis ) , applying this construction to the universal cover @xmath12 leads to all @xmath0-betti numbers @xmath13 for @xmath14 being zero  this follows from multiplicity under finite covers and a knneth - type formula . quite often",
    ", @xmath0-betti numbers vanish in situations where the ordinary betti numbers of the quotient space do not , and they are not necessarily integral real numbers ; a question that was open until recently was whether they can ever be irrational . for a layout of the theory of @xmath0-invariants , and in order to appreciate the impact that these ideas have had in mathematics so far , we refer the reader to the textbook  @xcite .",
    "an informal account of some basic notions , tailored to the purposes of the present paper , will be given in section  [ secl2bettis ] below .",
    "an example leading to nontrivial @xmath0-invariants is provided by the universal cover @xmath15 ( the disc ) of a compact oriented riemann surface @xmath16 of genus @xmath17 .",
    "this simple but somewhat crucial example was already considered in atiyah s original paper , where he illustrated his new theory by showing that @xmath18 availing oneself of the standard machinery  @xcite , the argument runs along the following lines .",
    "the @xmath0-betti numbers in degrees @xmath19 or @xmath20 must vanish because @xmath15 has no compact component , thus any nontrivial @xmath0-betti numbers must lie in degree 1 .",
    "then one uses that the @xmath0-euler characteristic of a co - compact space equals the ordinary euler characteristic of the quotient to conclude that @xmath21 as elegant as this argument may be , it throws very little light on the meaning attached to the result  ( [ atiyah ] ) .",
    "in addition , the definitions that have been provided for these invariants ( three different versions are proposed in  @xcite , all of which coincide in atiyah s example ) do not seem to give a hint to their geometrical content .",
    "this is in contrast with ordinary betti numbers in singular homology or de rham cohomology , for instance .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to remedy this situation , and place the formula ( [ atiyah ] ) on more intuitive ground .",
    "more precisely , our immediate interest is in the case where @xmath22 is not the universal cover of @xmath23 , but rather the maximal abelian cover of the surface with the action of the abelianization @xmath24 of its fundamental group , which we take as @xmath1 instead of @xmath25 .",
    "this is a somewhat easier version of atiyah s example ( admitting a slick proof that coincides with the one we have just sketched for the universal cover ) , and it is motivated by certain questions in mathematical physics that we shall elaborate on in section  [ physics ] . concretely , our main goal is to interpret the formula ( [ l2betti1 ] ) for the abelian cover in terms of a set of @xmath26 objects naturally associated to pair - of - pants decompositions of @xmath23  in a similar spirit to textbook presentations of concrete bases for @xmath27 in singular homology , or @xmath28 in de rham cohomology ( see e.g.  @xcite for the latter ) .",
    "the relevant objects to consider will emerge as certain equivariant homology classes that we will associate to pochhammer 1-cycles on pairs of pants , as explained in section  [ seclemniscates ] .",
    "we shall illustrate how this sort of interpretation plays a role in the context of gauge theory of charged particles on a surface @xmath23 in section  [ physics ] , after connecting @xmath0-betti numbers to witten s supersymmetric quantum mechanics  @xcite coupled to local systems on manifolds .",
    "we start by fixing an abelian group @xmath30 of rank @xmath31 .",

    "the picture is more intricate , as the spaces of internal structures coalesce nontrivially according to a fibration of the moduli space  @xcite @xmath459 with typical fibres depending on the natural filtration of @xmath460 by partitions of @xmath283 .",
    "more interesting structure emerges for gauged _ nonlinear _ sigma - models , where fundamental fermionic particles of different types coexist and can even merge nontrivially , giving rise to a much richer spectrum of quantum particles  @xcite .",
    "the fact that the moduli spaces are no longer compact in this situation leads to various difficulties , and their fundamental groups may also become non - abelian  @xcite .",
    "however , the description of the spatial quantum numbers provided by pochhammer curves in pair - of - pants decompositions remains useful in this context .",
    "this language should provide helpful tools to study quantization of moduli spaces of gauge theories on riemann surfaces more generally .",
