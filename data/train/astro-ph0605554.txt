    "novae are a subclass of cataclysmic variable stars . in these binaries ,",
    "matter from a secondary star is accreted onto the surface of a white dwarf . when this material gets sufficiently hot and dense for the white dwarf to ignite a thermonuclear runaway , it blows off the hot burning layer at the surface .",
    "this event , which leads to a rapid increase in the luminosity of the binary system , is called a nova outburst .",
    "v4745 sgr ( nova sgr 2003 # 1 ) was discovered independently by brown and yamato ( 2003 ) on april 25@xmath5 and 26@xmath5 2003 .",
    "optical and infrared spectroscopic confirmation was made by ashok & banerjee ( 2003 ) .",
    "the optical spectrum showed that it was a fe  ii nova ( williams 1992 ) , with strong balmer lines with p  cyg profiles .",
    "after rapid fading the nova rebrightened again and the balmer lines with fe  ii 4176 , 4233   showed complex p  cyg profiles ( kiss & jacob 2003 ) . a detailed low and medium resolution spectroscopic study of the transition phase of the nova was presented by csk et al .",
    "the spectral lines switched back to strong p cyg profiles during the peaks of oscillations .",
    "the authors concluded that the observed repetitive rebrightening events were due to multiple episodes of mass ejection and they proposed that the transition phase in classical novae is driven by repetitive instabilities of the hydrogen shell burning on the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "they derived an absolute magnitude of the system m@xmath6 = 8@xmath7.3 @xmath8 0@xmath7.5 and the interstellar reddening to be very low ( @xmath9 ) and this leads to a rough distance estimate of v4745 sgr ( between 9 and 19 kpc ) .",
    "v4745  sgr is a transient type of nova ( csk et al .",
    "2004 )  a nova with oscillations during the transition phase .",
    "several models have been suggested for the transition phase , such as stellar oscillations of the hot white dwarf , oscillations caused by the wind , formation of dust blobs that move in and out of line of sight to the nova , dwarf nova outbursts and oscillations of the common envelope ( bode & evans 1989 , leibowitz 1993 , warner 1995 , csk et al . 2005 ) .",
    "shaviv ( 2001 ) argued that super - eddington winds can be a natural explanation for the oscillatory behaviour during the transition phase of some novae .",
    "retter ( 2002 ) suggested another solution for the transition phase .",
    "he noticed that this phase occurs around the time when the accretion disk is re - established and proposed a possible connection between this phase and intermediate polars .",
    "finding rapid oscilations in the light curves of transient novae is required to support this hypothesis .    currently , there are about 50 novae with known orbital periods ( warner 2002 ) .",
    "typical nova periods range from 2 to 9 hours . finding the orbital period of a nova yields an estimate of the secondary mass ( smith & dhillon 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , detecting several periodicities in novae can help in classifying the system into different groups of cvs , such as magnetic systems , intermediate polars , and/or permanent superhump systems ( e.g. diaz & steiner 1989 , skillman et al .",

    "this yields valuable information about the magnetic field of the white dwarf and reveals the presence or absence of the accretion disk .",
    "the suggestion that the oscillations in the transition phase of novae are connected with intermediate polars motivated us to obtain continuous photometry of the nova v4745  sgr and to look for short - term periods in its light curve .    in this paper",
