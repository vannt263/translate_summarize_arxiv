    "the cosmological dark matter abundance is firmly established through observations of the cosmic microwave background and of the large scale structure of the universe @xcite . this is complemented by measurements of dark matter on smaller scales by studies of , e.g. the rotation curves of galaxies , gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters of galaxies @xcite , the velocity dispersion of galaxies in clusters of galaxies , and x - ray emitting hot gas in clusters of galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the particle nature of dark matter remains a puzzle .",
    "there are numerous dark matter candidates , among which the sterile neutrino is particularly well motivated .",
    "the sterile neutrino is a natural dark matter candidate in a minimally extended standard model of particle physics @xcite and it provides solutions to other problems : the masses of the active neutrinos @xcite , the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , and the observed peculiar velocities of pulsars @xcite .",
    "sterile neutrinos participate in the flavour - mass eigenstate oscillations of the active standard model neutrinos , and are thereby allowed to decay radiatively through a two - body decay with photon energy predicted to lie in the x - ray range ( @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the rest mass of the sterile neutrino ) .",
    "this renders it a testable dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "the decay rate of any dark matter candidate with a radiative two - body decay can be constrained from observations of dark matter concentrations ( for references see @xcite ) .",
    "the strongest constraints are obtained from studying dark matter dominated regions , and with instruments with high spectral resolution ( since the decay line is expected only to suffer negligible broadening ) .",
    "recent gravitational lensing observations of the mass distribution in galaxy clusters @xcite have identified cluster scale dark matter `` blobs '' with very low baryonic content .",
    "this allows for the novel possibility of using such almost pure dark matter blobs to probe the particle nature of the dark matter @xcite .",
    "below we analyze x - ray observations of the dark matter blob in the cluster of galaxies abell  520 .",
    "also , we analyze high resolution x - ray grating spectra of the cluster of galaxies abell  1835 , allowing us to improve constraints from earlier studies by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "when a spectrum has been obtained from an observation of a given dark matter dense region , there are different ways of searching for a hypothetical mono - energetic emission line and to determine an upper limit on the flux from decaying dark matter particles .",
    "the simplest and most conservative method is the `` slice method , '' where the energy range of the spectrum is divided into bins of a width equal to the instrumental energy resolution @xmath4 , and all of the x - ray flux in a particular bin is determined from a model fitted to the spectrum .",
    "the slice method is very robust , as the physics behind the fitted model is irrelevant , and the method does not require any assumptions about the x - ray background , but regards all received flux as an upper limit for the flux from decaying dark matter .",
    "this is despite the fact that the total flux is known to consist of several contributions ; the cosmic x - ray background from unresolved sources , the x - ray emission from the intra cluster medium , the milky way halo , and the instrumental background .",
    "the `` slice method '' takes into account that an emission line from decaying dark matter could `` hide '' under a line feature in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "other methods for constraining the flux ( for example @xcite ) can give stronger , but less robust , results ( for a discussion of different methods see @xcite ) . in this study",
    ", we conservatively use the slice method .",
    "a good spectral resolution is required to search for a mono - energetic emission line .",
    "the high spatial resolution of the _ chandra _ x - ray telescope can be turned into a very high spectral resolution ( @xmath5 ) by deflecting the incoming photons in a grating , as the deflection angle is highly sensitive to the photon energy .",
    "the acis - hetg instrument consists of two gratings , which on demand can be placed between the mirrors and the acis ccds : the high energy grating ( 0.89.0 ) , heg , and the medium energy grating , meg ( 0.45.0  kev ) .",
    "when the incoming photons are deflected in a grating , the information of their spatial origin is lost .",
    "this makes it impossible to optimize the ratio of expected dark matter signal to noise from x - ray emitting baryons in the observational field of view ( as described by @xcite ) . in this study ,",
    "the cluster of galaxies abell  1835 was targeted because most of the emission from the cluster comes from a region close to the observational axis making grating spectroscopy possible .",
    "abell  1835 has a luminosity distance of @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xcite ) , and the mass within the scale radius of @xmath8 is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "no other obvious mass concentrations are seen in the field of view .",
    "( here , and in the following , a cosmology with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 is assumed ) .    the spectral resolution of a grating spectrometer decreases proportionally to the angular extension of the source . for abell  1835",
    "the emission is dominated by photons from within the core radius , @xmath13 @xcite so this characteristic radius was used to determine the spectral resolution : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dispersion order .",
    "grating spectra of abell  1835 were extracted from the observation with i d 511 using ciao 3.3 .",
    "the first order deflections were combined into a single spectrum with a spectral bin size of @xmath16 and @xmath17 ( at @xmath18 ) for heg and meg , respectively .",
    "the line broadening due to the velocity dispersion of dark matter in abell  1835 is negligible ( @xmath19 ) .    with the spectral fitting package sherpa @xcite ,",
    "a thermal plasma model ( mekal , @xcite ) was fitted to the data with the temperature and abundance as free parameters .",
    "the model is an adequate representation of the data , giving a reduced @xmath20 of 1.2 in both cases ( 683 and 569 degrees of freedom for heg and meg , respectively ) .",
    "the flux was determined using the slice method for a slice width given by eq .",
    "[ eqn : sigma ] .",
    "for direct imaging data the field of view can be optimized by observing a dark matter dense region with low x - ray emission from baryons .",
    "a unique example is the merging cluster of galaxies abell  520 containing a `` blob '' of high mass concentration with very low x - ray emission discovered recently using weak gravitational lensing @xcite , see  [ fig : a520 ] .",
    "= 8.6 cm = 8.5 cm    an acis - s3 0.39.0  kev spectrum was extracted from the _ chandra _ observation with i d 4215 for a region centred at the dark blob ( @xmath21 ) and with a radius of @xmath22 ( the red circle in  [ fig : a520 ] ) . a model consisting of a power law and",
    "six gaussians was fitted to the spectrum with a reduced @xmath20 of 1.2 ( for 80 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "the flux was determined using the slice method for a slice width given by the resolution of acis - s3 : @xmath23    the mass of the dark matter blob in a520 has been derived from weak gravitational lensing to be * @xmath24*. this value is based on measuring the overdensity in the blob region with respect to the mean density in a surrounding annulus with inner and outer radius of 0.85 arcmin and 4 arcmin , respectively . hence , the mass value can be regarded as a conservative lower limit on the mass contained within the blob region .",
    "a detailed description of the data and methodology of the weak lensing analysis is given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the luminosity distance to a520 is @xmath25 ( @xmath26 , @xcite ) .",
    "let us now consider a specific dark matter candidate , the sterile neutrinos .",
    "they can decay radiatively as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is an active neutrino .",
    "this is a two - body decay with a photon energy of @xmath2 . assuming only one kind of dark matter , the observed flux , @xmath29 , at a given photon energy yields an upper limit on the flux from two - body radiatively decaying dark matter : @xmath30    the milky way dark matter halo",
    "will always be included in the observation , and its mass contribution to the total mass in the field of view has to be taken into account @xcite .",
    "for the milky way we use a virial mass of @xmath31 and by integration of a nfw profile we find the halo mass to have a mean distance of @xmath32 .",
    "the halo mass and mean distance varies less than a factor of two for a reasonable range of model parameters @xcite . for the grating observation of abell  1835 the milky way halo mass within",
    "the field of view is @xmath33 , and for the dark matter blob in abell  520 it is @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : decayrate ] shows the upper limit on the decay rate of any dark matter candidate ( given by eq .",
    "[ eqn : maxdecay ] ) obtained from the total amount of received flux for the abell  520 dark matter blob and the abell  1835 grating data .",
    "it is seen that the grating data of abell  1835 provide constraints that are one to two orders of magnitude stronger than the constraints obtained from observations of the milky way halo alone @xcite .",

    "= 8.6 cm = 6.1 cm    the constraints on the decay rate from the grating data of abell  1835 can be approximated by an analytical expression for heg and meg independently . as seen in  [ fig : fit ] , a second order polynomial describes the heg constraints quite well , and a sixth order polynomial fits the meg data : @xmath35    = 8.6 cm = 6.1 cm",

    "it is seen that even though no optimization of the field of view can be performed for the grating data , the improvement of instrumental spectral resolution leads to superior constraints .",
    "the grating constraints are very robust as they have been derived from the total amount of received x - ray flux without subtraction of any background contributions .",

    "we have analyzed grating spectra of the galaxy cluster abell  1835 , and a spectrum obtained through direct imaging of the almost pure dark matter blob in the galaxy cluster abell  520 .",
    "these provide the strongest constraints on radiatively decaying dark matter derived in a very conservative way from cosmic x - ray data .",
    "the mass and mixing angle can be constrained in the specific case of sterile neutrinos , leaving a low mass ( @xmath0  kev ) and low mixing angle ( @xmath1 ) window open .",
    "however , combined with other methods @xcite , the dodelson - widrow scenario for sterile neutrino production could soon be ruled out .",
    "other mechanisms for production of sterile neutrinos , for example , via inflaton decays @xcite , would satisfy all the constraints .",
    "the obtained constraints can be improved significantly by improving the signal to noise ratio ( optimization of field of view ) and by improving the instrumental spectral resolution .",
