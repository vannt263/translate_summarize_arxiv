    "it all began with the idea of an intrinsic limit to hadron thermodynamics . during the past fifty years",
    ", different conceptual approaches had led to an ultimate temperature of strongly interacting matter .",
    "pomeranchuk  @xcite first obtained it from the finite spatial extension of hadrons : a hadron can only have an independent existence if it has an independent volume .",
    "then hagedorn  @xcite arrived at a limiting temperature by postulating a self - similar hadronic resonance composition : a resonance consists of resonances which consist of resonances , and so on .",
    "the resulting excitation spectrum was later also derived in the dual resonance model  @xcite . with the advent of the quark infrastructure of hadrons and of quantum chromodynamics , it became clear that the ultimate temperature found in all these considerations was really a transition point to a new state of matter , to a plasma of deconfined quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "statistical qcd , in particular in the finite temperature lattice formulation , has subsequently confirmed this hypothesis : at a now rather well determined temperature ( for vanishing baryon density , @xmath0  mev ) , strongly interacting matter undergoes a transition from a medium of color singlet hadronic constituents to one of deconfined colored quarks and gluons  @xcite . the energy density at the transition point was found to be @xmath1  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the transition turns a hadronic state of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry into a quark - gluon plasma in which this symmetry is restored : at @xmath3 , the effective constituent quark mass of some 0.3  gev vanishes , and we recover the bare quark mass of the qcd lagrangian .",
    "the obvious desire to test this fascinating phase structure of strongly interacting matter first led to the fixed target experiments at the ags in brookhaven ( with @xmath4  gev ) and at the cern - sps ( with @xmath5  gev ) . in 1986/87 ,",
    "light ion beams on heavy ion targets started the program , and in 1994/95 , heavy ion beams followed .",
    "today , much of this program is concluded .",
    "so , what have we learned during the past fifteen years ? in this opening",
    "talk , i will address that question by asking :    * what did we expect to find ?",
    "* what did we find ?",
    "* what does that tell us ?    in my report , i will first recall briefly the expectations concerning signatures at the beginning of the experimental heavy ion program at the ags and sps in 1986 and then summarize what had really been found when it was ( in first generation experiments ) completed in 2000 . following this ,",
    "i will try to indicate what conclusions can be drawn from these results , for the conditions reached , from the hard probes of the early stages and from the observed hadronisation pattern at freeze - out .",
    "the evolution of a high energy nucleus - nucleus collision was pictured in the form shown in fig .",
    "after a rather short equilibration time @xmath6  fm , the presence of a thermalized medium was assumed , and for sufficiently high initial energy densities , this medium would be in the quark - gluon plasma phase .",
    "-4 mm -8 mm    -4 mm    the initial energy density of the produced medium at the time of thermalization was ( and still is ) generally determined by the bjorken estimate  @xcite = ( dn_h dy)_y=0 w_h r_a^2 _ 0 , [ 2.1 ] where @xmath7 specifies the number of hadronic secondaries emitted per unit rapidity at mid - rapidity and @xmath8 their average energy .",
    "the effective initial volume is determined in the transverse plane by the nuclear radius @xmath9 , and longitudinally by the formation time @xmath10 of the thermal medium .",
    "the temperature of the produced medium was assumed to be observable through the transverse mass spectrum of thermal dileptons and the momentum spectrum of thermal photons  @xcite .",
    "the observation of thermal dilepton / photon spectra would also indicate that the medium was indeed in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the functional form of the spectra is the same for radiation from hadronic matter and from a qgp ; but the observed rates and temperatures were expected to differ in the two cases .",
    "it was clear from the beginning that these signals would be emitted during the entire thermal evolution of the system , making a separation of different phases of origin not very straight - forward .",
    "the determination of the nature of the hot initial phase required a signature sensitive to deconfinement .",
    "it was argued that in a deconfined medium the j/@xmath11 would melt through color screening  @xcite and that , therefore , qgp production should lead to a suppression of j/@xmath11 production in nuclear collisions , compared to the rates extrapolated from @xmath12 data .",
    "similarly , the qgp was expected to result in a higher energy loss for a fast passing color charge than a hadronic medium , so that jet quenching  @xcite should also signal deconfinement .",
    "the behavior of sufficiently short - lived resonances , in particular the dilepton decay of the @xmath13 , was considered as a viable tool to study the hadronic medium in its interacting stage and thus provide information on the approach to chiral symmetry restoration  @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the hot medium was thought to be measurable through broadening and azimuthal anisotropies of hadronic transverse momentum spectra  @xcite .",
    "the size and age of the source at freeze - out was assumed to be obtainable through hanbury - brown  twiss ( hbt ) interferometry based on two - particle correlations  @xcite .",
    "it was expected that increasing the collision energy would increase the density and hence the expansion of the produced medium , so that the hbt radii should grow with @xmath14 .",
    "the final interacting hadronic medium was discussed in terms of an ideal resonance gas , following an old suggestion  @xcite brought to hadron physics by hagedorn  @xcite : an interacting system of elementary constituents can be replaced by a non - interacting gas of resonances , provided the elementary interactions are resonance - dominated .",
    "this would provide the relative abundances of all hadron species in terms of just two parameters , the temperature and the baryon number density .",
    "one particularly interesting feature here was the fact that in elementary hadronic interactions , an overall reduction of strangeness production was observed .",
    "nuclear collisions , in particular if leading to a qgp as initial stage  @xcite , were expected to remove this reduction and lead to strangenes production in accord with thermal predictions .",
    "the initial energy density , as specified by the bjorken estimate , eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) , was measured in almost all sps experiments . in fig .",
    "[ e - dens ] we show @xmath15 as function of centrality , determined by the number of participant nucleons  @xcite ; it covers the range from somewhat above 1 to almost 3.5  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "finite temperature lattice calculations , as already mentioned , give for the energy density at deconfinement , @xmath16 , values around or slightly below 1  gev/@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "however , also high energy @xmath17 collisions lead to energy density estimates well above 1  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "-8 mm    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     -8 mm    -4 mm    from percolation theory  @xcite , it is known that the formation of large - scale clusters is a critical phenomenon ; it does not occur gradually as function of parton density . in the ` thermodynamic ' limit of large nuclei ,",
    "the cluster size diverges at a specific critical parton density , and even for finite systems it suddenly increases in a very narrow band of density .",
    "thus there exists a statistical approach to critical behavior which does not pre - suppose thermalization and which can be applied to the pre - equilibrium stage of the nuclear collision evolution @xcite .    in a central high energy nucleus - nucleus collision ,",
    "the partons in the two nuclei lead in the transverse plane to an initial condition schematically illustrated in fig . [ pp ] .",
    "the transverse size of the partons is essentially determined by the intrinsic transverse momentum , @xmath18 .",
    "the number of partons contained in a nucleon is known from deep inelastic scattering experiments .",
    "it is parametrized by a parton distribution function depending on the fraction @xmath19 ( denoting parton and nucleon momenta by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) and on the scale @xmath22 used to resolve the nucleonic parton structure . while in lepton - hadron scattering the scale is set by the virtual photon , in minimum bias nucleon - nucleon or @xmath23 collisions it is determined by the transverse momentum of the partons themselves .",
    "we denote the nuclear radius in fig .",
    "[ pp ] by @xmath24 , the average parton radius by @xmath25 , and then study the variation of the average cluster size as function of the parton density @xmath26 . in the limit @xmath27 , the cluster size diverges at the percolation threshold @xmath28 : s_cl ~(n_p -n)^- , [ pp1 ] with the critical exponent @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "percolation thus specifies the onset of connection as a critical phenomenon . for finite @xmath24",
    ", there is a pronounced but finite peak at a slightly shifted density , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cluster ] .",
    "-6 mm -8 mm    -6 mm    to apply this formalism to nuclear collisions  @xcite ,",
    "we need the transverse parton size and the effective number of partons for a given collision configuration . the distribution of partons in a nucleon is determined in the analysis of deep inelastic scattering data ; per nucleon in a nucleon - nucleon collision , at mid - rapidity and for c.m.s .",
    "energy @xmath14 , one has n_parton(x ,",
    "q^2 ) = ( dn_q dy)_y=0 = xg(x , q^2 ) + , [ pp2 ] where @xmath30 label the gluon , quark and antiquark distributions , respectively , and the sum runs over the quark species . at @xmath31",
    ", the fractional parton momentum @xmath19 becomes @xmath32 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ pp ] , there is a distribution of partons of different transverse sizes up to the resolution scale @xmath33 ; we approximate this by the average value @xmath34 .    in nucleus - nucleus collisions at sps energies",
    ", it is a good approximation to consider that the activated partons originate from wounded or participant nucleons . at higher energies",
    ", there will also exist collision - dependent contributions  @xcite .",
    "we thus obtain for central @xmath23 collisions the percolation condition n_parton(x , q^2 ) = 1.13 q^-2 ; [ pp3 ] it determines the onset of color connection as function of @xmath35 and of the c.m .  collision energy @xmath14 . at @xmath36  gev",
    ", we obtain  @xcite :    for @xmath37 , no color connection ,    for @xmath38 , a connected parton condensate .",
    "the parton condensate formed beyond the percolation point consists of overlapping and hence interacting partons from all involved nucleons .",
    "it thus constitutes a deconfined pre - thermal medium , which is a necessary precursor for qgp formation , since color connection is a prerequisite for thermalization .",
    "the parton condensate is characterized by a scale @xmath39 , where @xmath40 specifies the onset of percolation for central collisions at a given @xmath35 and @xmath41 .",
    "the average transverse momentum of partons in the condensate is determined by this scale , so that @xmath42 is in a sense a precursor of temperature .",
    "increasing @xmath35 or @xmath14 leads to higher @xmath42 , indicating something like a  hotter \" medium .",
    "we have here concentrated on the onset of parton condensation as a critical phenomenon determined by percolation of quarks and gluons as geometric entities in the transverse plane .",
    "the behavior of the dense parton condensate in the limit of large @xmath35 and @xmath14 , the color glass condensate , has been studied intensively over the past years in terms of classical color fields .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear from these studies that the pre - equilibrium stage plays a much more decisive role in nuclear collisions than previously envisioned . in the last part of this section , we consider one interesting experimental consequence of the onset of parton condensation .    to study this onset as function of centrality in a given @xmath43 collision",
    ", we have to replace @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ pp3 ] ) by the density of wounded nucleons @xmath45 calculated for a given impact parameter @xmath46 , using the actual nuclear profile ( woods - saxon ) . for pb - pb collisions at",
    "@xmath47  gev , this leads to    for @xmath48 , no color connection ,    for @xmath49 , a connected parton condensate .    instead of the impact parameter",
    ", we have here used the number of wounded nucleons to specify the collision centrality , with @xmath50 for @xmath51 .",
    "note that at this threshold point , the bjorken estimate for the energy density gives @xmath52  gev/@xmath2 .",
    "this clearly shows that the onset of color connection only occurs at a much higher energy density than the value given by finite temperature lattice qcd for a thermalized medium .",
    "as mentioned above , charmonium suppression in nuclear collisons was one of the proposed signatures for quark - gluon plasma formation . in the light of present thinking",
    ", we have to consider the fate of the charmonium states already in the parton condensate phase .",
    "this can be addressed in different ways , invoking generalized color screening  @xcite , dipole break - up in a random color field  @xcite , etc .",
    "we shall here simply consider the intrinsic scale @xmath53 of a given charmonium state @xmath54 ( j/@xmath11 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ) and assume that when it is exceeded by the condensate scale , q_s > q_i , [ pp4 ] the charmonium state is dissolved .",
    "we are thus assuming that @xmath42 plays in the pre - equilibrium state the role of the critical temperature or of the screening mass in a thermal medium .",
    "to show the consequences of this assumption , we must first recall that j/@xmath11 production in hadronic collisions occurs in part through feed - down from higher excited states : about 60% of the observed j/@xmath11 in proton - proton collisions are directly produced @xmath57 states , the remaining 40% coming from @xmath55 ( @xmath5830% ) and @xmath56 ( @xmath5810% ) decays .",
    "the intrinsic scales of these states are given by their radii , r_j/ ( 0.9  gev)^-1 ,   r _ ( 0.6  gev)^-1 ,   r_^ ( 0.6  gev)^-1 .",
    "[ pp5 ]    -8 mm -8 mm    -4 mm    from the centrality dependence of @xmath42 shown in fig .",
    "[ q - s ] , we find that , at sps energies , charmonia suppression sets in at    @xmath49 for the @xmath55 and @xmath56 contributions ,    @xmath59 for direct j/@xmath11 production ,    to be compared with the observed pattern shown in fig .",
    "[ na50 ] . obviously these results must be studied in more detail , but it appears quite likely that the onset of j/@xmath11 suppression indeed indicates an onset of deconfinement , while not implying any thermalization",
    ".    -8 mm -8 mm    -4 mm",
    "so let us summarize what we have learned in the first fifteen years of ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we know that there is an intrinsic limit to hadronic matter , in accord with the phase diagram determined in statistical qcd .",
    "the confinement boundary is established by the sps / ags program and agrees , both qualitatively and quantitatively , with the predictions of lattice qcd .",
    "i believe that the rhic and lhc experiments can only reconfirm this . for small @xmath60 , we know the onset of hadronization , and we know that strangeness enhancement , transverse momentum broadening and hbt radii saturate at this onset .",
    "the early stage of the medium produced in nuclear collisions at the sps is partonic . with increasing @xmath35 ,",
    "the partons begin to form connected clusters , and at a certain critical density , they form a color condensate consisting of interacting partons from many different nucleons . hence , at this point , color deconfinement begins : partons no longer have a clear origin or exist in well - defined numbers . the parton condensate is a necessary precursor of the qgp : it provides the interacting deconfined partons which , if given enough time for equilibration , can make a qgp .",
    "charmonium states of different binding energies and spatial sizes probe different parton scales of the produced initial state .",
    "the observed step - wise form of anomalous j/@xmath11 suppression appears to provide the first signal for color deconfinement through parton condensation ; this does not require any thermalization .",
    "the forthcoming j/@xmath11 production measurements at full sps energy but with lower @xmath35 , to be performed by na60 , should further clarify this point .",
    "in particular , the comparison between pb - pb and in - in j/@xmath11 suppression patterns should determine the critical densities and scales .",
    "pioneering results in physics always need to be reconfirmed .",
    "but if these limits of confinement survive the test of time , we will remember that they were first found in sps / ags experiments .",
    "so , at the beginning of the collision evolution at the sps , there appears to be color deconfinement ; at the end , thermalization and collective behavior . to produce a quark - gluon plasma medium",
    ", we need to have both at the early stage .",
    "let us see if the future data from experiments at the much higher rhic and lhc energies can achieve this .",
    "but no matter how well - defined the road for further exploration may seem to be , i am sure that the forthcoming studies will rediscover the one feature which has made this field so challenging and exciting .",
    "it is perhaps best summarized by the spanish poet antonio machado  @xcite :    _ caminante , son tus huellas el camino , y nada ms ; _",
    "_ caminante , no hay camino , se hace camino al andar .",
    "_ traveller , the road is nothing more than your footprints ; _    _",
