    "i zwicky 1 (; @xmath5 ) is considered the prototypical narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) mainly due to its distinct optical properties . at x - ray energies the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) exhibits behaviour that is somewhat more modest than for typical nls1s ( e.g. leighly 1999a , 1999b ) . however , a short ( @xmath2 )  observation conducted in 2002 revealed a plethora of interesting characteristics , such as : hard x - ray flaring , unresolved transition array ( uta ) absorption , and possibly multiple fe  emission lines ( gallo 2004a , hereafter g04 ) .    the discoveries in g04 prompted further examination with a second longer   observation .",
    "this is the first of three papers which describe the x - ray properties of  utilising all  data . in this work ,",
    "we present an @xmath0 observation and describe the mean spectral and timing characteristics of the agn , as well as compare the data to the earlier 2002 observation .",
    "the complex ionised absorber and its long - term variability is discussed in detail in the work of costantini ( 2007 ) .",
    "in addition ,  exhibits remarkable short - term spectral variability during the 2005 observation .",
    "this is presented in gallo ( 2007 ) .",
    "was observed for the second time by  ( jansen 2001 ) on 2005 july 1819 during revolution 1027 ( obsid 0300470101 ) ( hereafter we will refer to this as the 2005 observation ) .",
    "the total duration was @xmath0 , during which time all instruments were functioning normally .",
    "the epic pn ( strder 2001 ) and mos ( mos1 and mos2 ; turner 2001 ) cameras were operated in small - window mode with the medium filter in place . the reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs1 and rgs2 ; den herder 2001 ) also collected data during this time , as did the optical monitor ( om ; mason 2001 ) .    the observation data files ( odfs ) from the 2002 and 2005 observations were processed to produce calibrated event lists using the   science analysis system ( sas v7.0.0 ) .",
    "unwanted hot , dead , or flickering pixels were removed as were events due to electronic noise .",
    "event energies were corrected for charge - transfer inefficiencies .",
    "epic response matrices were generated using the sas tasks arfgen and rmfgen .",
    "light curves were extracted from these event lists to search for periods of high background flaring .",
    "some background flaring is detected toward the end of the 2005 observation , and the data during those periods have been neglected .",
    "the total amount of good exposure time selected was @xmath6 and @xmath7 for the pn and mos detectors , respectively .",
    "source photons were extracted from a circular region 35@xmath8 across and centred on the source .",
    "the background photons were extracted from a larger off - source region and appropriately scaled to the source - selection region .",
    "single and double events were selected for the pn detector , and single - quadruple events were selected for the mos .",
    "the data quality flag was set to zero ( i.e. events next to a ccd edge or bad pixel were omitted ) .",
    "the total number of source counts collected by the pn instrument in the @xmath9 range was approximately @xmath10 . in the @xmath11 band , the mos instruments collected about @xmath12 ( mos1 ) and @xmath13 ( mos2 ) source counts .",
    "comparing the source and background spectra we found that the spectra are source dominated between @xmath14 . the epic pn spectrum is analysed in the @xmath9 band where the calibration is most certain . to avoid cross - calibration uncertainties at low energies ,",
    "the mos spectra are neglected below @xmath15 .",
    "the 2005 spectra from all instruments show relatively good agreement in these energy bands , within known calibration uncertainties ( kirsch 2006 ) , so they are fitted simultaneously unless stated otherwise .",
    "as the broad - band light curve is less sensitive to calibration uncertainties , the data between @xmath14 are utilised .",
    "the rgs were operated in standard spectro+q mode in 2005 , and a total exposure of @xmath0 was collected .",
    "the rgs data are used in the analysis of the ionised absorber in  ( costantini 2007 ) and will not be discussed here .    during 2005 ,",
    "was observed with the om in fast - mode through four filters ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the purpose was to examine possible optical variability .",
    "unfortunately , the agn was not well centred in the small , fast - mode frame and fell close to the detector edge .",
    "consequently , optical variability could not be examined in a robust manner .",
    "during the @xmath2 2002 observation  exhibited a modest x - ray flare , which lasted a total of @xmath20 ( g04 ) .",
    "notably the flare appeared to be quite hard , concentrated in the @xmath21 band , thus inducing spectral variability . aside from this lone event the light curve was relatively quiet in comparison to many nls1 .",
    "the 2005 light curve appears more active , consistently variable with , on average , larger amplitudes than observed in 2002 ( figure  [ fig : xuvlc ] ) .",
    "perhaps the most interesting event in the light curve is the sharp drop about @xmath22 into the observation .",
    "there is spectral variability related to the light curve , and this is discussed at length in gallo ( 2007 ) . here",
    ", we will focus on the flux variations .",
    "light curves were created in three epic pn energy bands : @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath21 . using the light curves in @xmath25 bins , each of the high - energy light curves was cross - correlated ( following edelson & krolik 1988 ) with the the @xmath23 band to search for possible lags ( positive delay means hard - band lags the soft - band ) . all of the cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) were asymmetric toward positive lags ( figure  [ fig : ccf ] ) . as will be demonstrated in the spectral analysis , the softest band is the region where both the power law component and the soft excess component influence the spectrum .",
    "both higher bands are dominated by the power law component alone .",
    "there are a few agn where time delays as a function of fourier frequency ( see nowak 1999 and references therein for details ) have been determined ( see papadakis 2001 for the first reported detection in an agn ) .",
    "if there were a _",
    "delay between the light curves in the various energy bands , then the time delay between all of the fourier frequencies would be the same .",
    "in contrast , what is typically observed is that as the frequency of the fourier components decreases , the delays increase .",
    "furthermore , as the energy band separation between two light curves increases , the delays , at the same frequency , also increase ( e.g. see arvalo 2006 for a recent discussion ) .    in the case of , we can not estimate time lags as a function of frequency due to limited signal in the hard - band light curve .",
    "however , the ccfs are consistent with what we observe in other agn and nls1 .",
    "the ccfs show broad humps around zero time lag with an asymmetry toward positive lags , but not a single , distinct delay .",
    "this is consistent with the hypothesis that in , just like in other seyferts , the sine and cosine functions in the hard - band light curves are delayed with respect to those in the soft - band light curves , but the delay is not the same for all of them : the delays increase with decreasing frequency and increased separation between the energy bands",
    ".    of interest may be the particularly small values measured in the ccfs ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "we examine this further by directly comparing light curves in each energy band normalised to their respective mean ( figure  [ fig : nrmlc ] ) .",
    "most obvious in the comparison between the @xmath23 and @xmath21 band is the significance of the delay between @xmath27 ( vertical dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : nrmlc ] ) .",
    "in particular , the delay seemingly begins at the onset of the sharp dip in the light curve .",
    "if we calculate the ccf in this time regime alone we see a clear dominant lag at @xmath28 ( figure  [ fig : lag ] ) .    however , as figure  [ fig : nrmlc ] demonstrates , the lag is not always present .",
    "sometimes there are no delays , and at other times the light curves show different behaviour and even anti - correlations ( e.g. @xmath29 and @xmath30 into the observation ) .",
    "all of these factors contribute to the small value of the ccf peaks .",
    "similar behaviour was seen in the nls1 iras  132243809 ( gallo 2004b ) where the authors suggested possible alternating lags between high- and low - energy bands ( i.e. sometimes hard band lags and other times it leads ) .",
    "the source spectra were grouped such that each bin contained at least 20 counts ( typically more ) .",
    "spectral fitting was performed using xspec v11.3.0 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "all parameters are reported in the rest frame of the source unless specified otherwise .",
    "the quoted errors on the model parameters correspond to a 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter ( i.e. a @xmath31 = 2.7 criterion ) .",
    "a value for the galactic column density toward  of @xmath32 ( elvis 1989 ) is adopted in all of the spectral fits .",
    "k - corrected luminosities are calculated using a hubble constant of @xmath33=@xmath34 and a standard flat cosmology with @xmath35 = 0.3 and @xmath36 = 0.7 .    in the analysis of the 2002 data ,",
    "g04 were able to fit the spectra with various phenomenological models , but could not distinguish a superior one . while they were able to establish that a second , soft component was a necessary part of the continuum they were unable to determine whether the soft excess was curved ( e.g. blackbody - like ) or flat ( power law - like ) .      as was done for the 2002 data ( g04 ) ,",
    "we built - up a broad - band spectral model for the 2005 observation utilising all the epic data .",
    "fitting the @xmath37 epic spectra with a single power law ( each instrument having free photon index ( @xmath38 ) and normalisation to accommodate existing cross - calibration uncertainties ) resulted in a satisfactory model ( @xmath39 ) . adding a gaussian profile to this continuum , with a common energy ( @xmath40 ) and width ( @xmath41 ) among all three instruments was a significant improvement ( @xmath42 for 5 free additional parameters ) .",
    "the best fit line parameters were @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "g04 introduced the possibility of multiple line features in the fe  region of the 2002 spectrum , including an intrinsically narrow @xmath48 line .",
    "no such line is present in the 2005 spectrum .",
    "a narrow , neutral line is completely insignificant in the pn spectrum and any such feature in the mos has an @xmath49 .    a comparable improvement ( @xmath50 for 5 free additional parameters ) can be achieved if a disc line profile ( fabian 1989 ) rather than a gaussian profile is used for the broad residuals . in this case",
    "the best - fit energy and inner disc radius are @xmath51 and @xmath52 gravitational radii , respectively .",
    "the disc inclination ( @xmath53 ) is fixed at @xmath54 , to remain consistent with our finding in section  [ sect : ref05 ] .",
    "leaving the parameter free to vary does not enhance the fit statistics , nor does it affect the best - fit line energy .",
    "the line strength is @xmath55 in each spectrum . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the gaussian profile .      extrapolating the @xmath37 fit to @xmath56 in the pn and @xmath15 in the two mos left a gradual rise in the residuals that is typically associated with the soft excess .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as is seen in table  [ tab : pnref ] there is no strong indication for a change in the shape of the direct power law component between 2002 and 2005 .",
    "in addition , most of the blurring and reflection parameters have been fixed .",
    "the most notable changes are in the amount of absorption ( as noted in previous fits and by costantini 2007 ) , the reflection fraction ( @xmath57 , fraction of reflected emission to power law emission in the @xmath9 band ) , and in the level at which the reflection component contributes to the total @xmath9 spectrum ( @xmath58 in 2002 and @xmath59 in 2005 ) .",
    "in the analysis of g04 there were indications that the broad feature in the 2002 observation was composed of multiple ( at least two ) narrower emission lines . in the 2005 observation",
    ", the residuals can be fit by a single gaussian profile . based on the width of the line ( @xmath44 ) in the epic spectra",
    ", the line - emitting region is between @xmath60 .",
    "similar distance estimates come from the disc line fit and the blurred reflection model . given the long observation and proximity of the line emitting region",
    "makes it plausible to search for line variability .",
    "the mean pn spectrum was divided into 17 segments , each of @xmath61 .",
    "the exposure in each segment was @xmath62 , taking account of the live - time of the pn camera in small window mode .",
    "the average number of source counts in the @xmath63 band was slightly more than @xmath64 .",
    "the counts were grouped into spectra such that each bin contained at least 20 counts . for each @xmath61 spectrum",
    "the continuum was determined by fitting the @xmath65 band with a power law , while excluding the @xmath66 range .",
    "the omitted band was replaced and the spectrum was rebinned into channels of @xmath67 .",
    "excess counts above the continuum in each @xmath67 bin were recorded . from this information",
    "an excess residual image was created as illustrated in iwasawa ( 2004 ; and in prep ) .",
    "the result is analogous to modelling each spectrum with a power law plus gaussian profile and measuring the flux in the gaussian component .",
    "the advantage of creating an excess residual image is that we can circumvent the limitations of working in the poisson regime , thus making trends in the variations of the line - flux more visible .",
    "the resulting image from the 2005 observation is shown in figure  [ fig:6kevex ] and clearly indicates that the broad - line flux is variable .",
    "most notably , the line flux diminishes significantly @xmath68 from the start of the observation .    to create a light curve from the image ,",
    "the excess counts between @xmath69 were accumulated .",
    "uncertainties on the light - curve data points were estimated from monte carlo simulations of the excess residual image .",
    "one - thousand images were created in an identical manner as done for .",
    "the spectra from which the images were derived were simulated for identical conditions as the 2005 observation , assuming a power law plus stationary gaussian profile .",
    "the uncertainty in the observed light curve was taken to be the standard deviation in the excess counts resulting from the simulated images .",
    "details of the process including caveats are discussed in iwasawa ( 2004 ) .",
    "the fe  light curve shows clear variability ( figure  [ fig:6kevlc ] ) with a constant fit being unacceptable ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "the fractional variability amplitude ( @xmath71 , using uncertainties derived in edelson 2002 ) is @xmath72 per cent .",
    "a light curve of the @xmath73 continuum was generated based on the power law fits used to derive the fe  light curve .",
    "the uncertainties in the @xmath73 flux were assumed to be the same as the uncertainty in the corresponding count rate .",
    "the continuum light curve , normalised to its average flux , is shown in figure  [ fig : cline ] with the broad - line flux light curve ( figure  [ fig:6kevlc ] ) , normalised to its average flux , overplotted as a dashed curve .",
    "interestingly , the curves appear to be anti - correlated in some parts of the light curve .",
    "cross - correlating the broad - line and @xmath73 continuum light curves indicates a weak correlation with the broad - line light curve lagging the continuum fluctuations by @xmath74 ( lower panel figure  [ fig : cline ] ) .",
    "the fractional variability in the @xmath73 continuum is @xmath75 per cent , less than the @xmath71 in the fe  line .",
    "statistically , the amplitude of the continuum variations is consistent with the fe  variations within about 2-@xmath41 .",
    "however , the difference is likely larger since the uncertainties on @xmath71 are conservatively over - estimated ( edelson 2002 ) .      in fitting the spectra in various segments of the 2002 observation",
    ", g04 found little evidence of intensity variations in the broad - line . we take advantage of the excess - residual technique to re - examine the broad - line variability in the 2002 observation .",
    "an excess - residual image has been created for the 2002 pn observation in a nearly identical manner as was done for the 2005 observation .",
    "the only difference is that the time resolution is slightly better during 2002 because the mean spectrum was divided into 6 segments of @xmath76 each ( rather than @xmath61 ) .",
    "this can be done without degrading the data quality because the  was brighter in 2002 and because the observation was conducted in large - window mode , which has a ccd live - time of @xmath77 per cent ; therefore the actual exposure in each segment of the 2002 observation is almost the same as the exposure in each segment of the 2005 data .",
    "the 2002 excess - residual image is shown in figure  [ fig:2002res ] .",
    "the broad - line is dominant in the @xmath78 range , but there is also apparent brightening that occurs in the @xmath79 band between @xmath80 .",
    "this is of particular interest because the continuum light curve shows a hard x - ray flare that peaks during this time interval ( see g04 ) .",
    "light curves were extracted from the excess - residual image in the @xmath78 ( blue line ) and @xmath79 ( red line ) bands .",
    "they were then normalised to their respective means and plotted with the normalised 2002 @xmath21 continuum light curve ( figure  [ fig : cline2002 ] ) .",
    "as the observation was so short uncertainties in the residual - image light curves were not derived in a robust manner as was done for the 2005 data .",
    "we also note that propagation of poisson uncertainties in each data bin yields very large error bars ( on the order of 100 per cent ) , therefore we are only illustrating a trend in figure  [ fig : cline2002 ] .",
    "the light curves suggest that the variations are more intense in the @xmath79-line than in the @xmath78-line .",
    "there also is no obvious connection between the @xmath78-line light curve and that of the continuum . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath79 variations appear to be well correlated with the high - energy continuum variations and , despite the unknown size of the true error bars in the @xmath79-line light curve , the trend is obvious .",
    "the strong  emission in the optical spectrum of  was noted a half century ago ( sargent 1968 ) , and given the intensity and narrowness of the lines the agn became a laboratory for  studies ( e.g. phillips 1976 , 1977 , 1978 ; boroson & green 1992 ; laor 1997 ; vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ) .",
    "its narrow balmer lines were also noted fairly early on ( e.g. oke & lauer 1979 ) .    when a formal definition of the nls1 class was established ( osterbrock & pogge 1985 ) , based on optical spectral properties , it was realised that  was already the best - studied member of this class of agn , likely leading to its labelling as the prototype nls1 . however , some x - ray properties are also characteristic of nls1s and  does not exhibit all these qualities to noticeable levels .",
    "in fact , in some instances  even displays behaviour that is atypical of the class . for example ,  is observed through a column density intrinsic to the agn .",
    "this is unusual for nls1s ( e.g. boller , brandt & fink 1996 ) , but also for type 1 agn in general .",
    "the soft excess emission above the underlying steep power law is weak in  compared to most nls1s , and not because of the relatively high intrinsic absorption ( e.g. leighly 1999b , tanaka 2005 ) .",
    "even the clear detection of a broad fe  emission line in  seems unusual given that nls1s appear not to show broad emission lines so obviously ( e.g. fabian 2002 , 2004 ; guainazzi 2006 ) .",
    "the identification of  as the prototype nls1 originated due to its well - studied optical properties , but it now lingers mainly as a historic perspective .",
    "it can even be argued that some of its x - ray properties are atypical of the norm .",
    "the average ccfs calculated in section  3 show a tendency for positive lags ( hard band following soft band ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed in other agn ( e.g. arvalo 2006 and references therein ) and galactic black holes ( e.g. mcclintock & remillard 2005 ) .",
    "however the origin of the lags is not certain .    in a simple corona with a uniform temperature and optical depth",
    ", variations can result from fluctuations in the intensity of the seed photons .",
    "variations of this nature should produce fixed delays between low- and high - energy bands , resulting in a common time delay for all fourier components .",
    "we do not estimate time lags as a function of frequency in ; however the broad , asymmetric ccfs suggest that we do not have a single , well defined delay between the various energy bands .",
    "examination of normalised light curves in different energy bands further supports this .",
    "a time lag is only seen in parts of the light curves .",
    "in fact , at times the light curves are not correlated , or are actually anti - correlated .",
    "lags are seen in cyg  x-1 , which can be attributed to spectral evolution in magnetic flares as they detach from the accretion disc ( e.g. poutanen & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the lags are manifested by material that propagates toward the black hole from regions of soft x - ray emission to regions of hard x - ray emission ( e.g. bttcher & liang 1999 ; kotov 2001 ) .",
    "based on the observation of another nls1 , iras  13224 + 3809 , gallo ( 2004b ) claimed a lag that alternated ( sometimes hard band followed other times it led ) , with possible dependency on the average flux of the source .",
    "there is likely similar behaviour here as the first notable lag coincides with a sharp flux dip in the light curve about @xmath22 into the observation .",
    "significant variations in the low - energy spectra of some seyfert  1 galaxies have been previously observed and interpreted as changes in the low - energy continuum component ( e.g. page 2002 , starling 2004 ) . in the case of , this",
    "does not appear to be the most straightforward explanation .",
    "there is detectable diminishing of the intrinsic column density in  since 2002 .",
    "the exact change depends on what continuum model is assumed , but appears to be at least on the @xmath81 per cent level .",
    "changes in the neutral column density have been reported in several type 2 ( i.e. absorbed ) agn ( e.g. risaliti 2002 ) , but to the best of our knowledge not in a nls1 .",
    "is a merging and starburst system so there are several sources of absorption that exist in the galaxy and could feasibly change ( e.g. due to bulk motion or dissipation of an absorbing component ) over the span of a few years , which separates the two observations .",
    "the broad fe  line in  shows remarkable short - term variability .",
    "understanding the origin of this variability is challenging .",
    "figure  [ fig : cline ] suggests that the emission line and continuum variations could be correlated if we consider the iron - line fluctuations to lag the continuum by @xmath82 .",
    "such a delay would place the iron - line emitting region at approximately @xmath83 in .",
    "the distance is too large to account for the width of the iron feature which based on various spectral fits ( e.g. gaussian profile , disc line profile , blurred ionised reflector ) , originates within about @xmath84 .",
    "a second problem is that the amplitude of the variations appears to be larger in the fe  line than in the @xmath73 continuum that would be producing it . even if we assume that the amplitudes of the variations are identical , it would be unlikely that all of the incident continuum will be reprocessed by the iron producing region and then emitted back into our line - of - sight .",
    "another possibility is that the variations are a result of some extrinsic effect rather than intrinsic changes in the line - emitting region .",
    "for example , motion within the accretion disc could account for some of the flux changes ( e.g. iwasawa 2004 ) . in this case",
    ", one would expect energy modulation in the excess residual map , which are not present in figure  [ fig:6kevex ] .",
    "however , the strength of the modulations is dependent on the distance of the line - emitting region from the black hole and the disc inclination",
    ". it could be that in  this combination of parameters does not generate observable modulations .    in a speculative approach",
    ", we fit the fe  line light curve ( figure  [ fig:6kevlc ] ) with a sine curve .",
    "the fit was statistically good ( @xmath85 ) and the implied period was @xmath86 .",
    "if the @xmath86 corresponds to the orbital period of the emitting region around the black hole , then we can estimate the distance ( e.g. following bardeen 1972 ) to be @xmath87 .",
    "this distance is consistent with that estimated from the width of the broad fe  line in the spectral models , but it is not clear why only the line - emitting region is affected in this manner and not the continuum .    finally , the fe  variations could be due to variations in some optically - thick absorber in the line - emitting region .",
    "such obscuring material could be created from instabilities in the accretion disc of highly inhomogeneous flows ( e.g. merloni 2006 ) .",
    "the most impressive feature in the 2002 continuum light curve of  was a modest x - ray flare concentrated in the @xmath21 band .",
    "the @xmath78 line - emission is not particularly variable and demonstrates no connection to the continuum variations .",
    "this behaviour is typical of other results ( e.g. iwasawa 2004 ) .",
    "however , the @xmath79 line - emission exhibits more intense variations which mimic the continuum light curve . in particular , the peak intensity in the @xmath79-line light curve corresponds well with the peak of the hard x - ray flare .",
    "due to limited data , examination of time - resolved spectra during 2002 do not yield significant results .",
    "the likely correlation between the continuum and @xmath79-line light curve suggests that this is emission due to fe  , which is produced in a spot on the accretion disc that is illuminated by the x - ray flare ( i.e. perhaps co - rotating with the disc ) .",
    "the @xmath78-line emission is representative of the average broad - line emission , which is produced at distances of @xmath88 as suggested by its width .",
    "the @xmath79-line emission and hard x - ray flare are generated closer to the black hole where doppler and gravitational effects are more intense than the region where the @xmath78 emission line is produced ( i.e. @xmath89 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the low - energy emission could be related to the narrow @xmath48 ( @xmath90 observed - frame ) emission feature that was identified in the 2002 spectrum by g04 .",
    "since the feature was not detected in the 2005 spectrum its origin could be connected to the transient @xmath79-line ( perhaps the blue - wing of this line ) , which is produced during the x - ray flare .",
    "the combination of a hard x - ray flare , and redshifted and broadened fe  emission line has been seen in a very similar object , nab  0205 + 024 ( gallo 2004c ) . however , due to limited data , time - resolved spectral modelling did not yield information about possible line variability .",
    "re - examination of the nab  0205 + 024 data making use of excess residual imaging may be fruitful .",
    "the level of absorption ( neutral and ionised ) appears to have changed between the two epochs .",
    "however , even after considering this there does seem to be some subtle change in the intrinsic continuum shape .",
    "it is of interest to compare the changes in the context of a physical model such as reflection and light bending . in terms of the blurred reflection model ,",
    "most of the intrinsic changes can be understood as arising from different relative contributions of the two continuum components . at both epochs ( and historically ) ,  appears to be in a power law dominated state  the soft excess is notably weak in this object .",
    "if the power law component is a compact isotropic emitting source located above the black hole , as depicted in the light - bending scenario ( e.g. miniutti & fabian 2004 ) , then the changes in the continuum shape are largely motivated by the proximity of this source to the black hole . in the higher flux",
    "2002 observation , the contribution from the reflection component was less , and hence the soft excess was weaker .",
    "the agn was brighter and in a power law dominated state .",
    "in 2005 ,  was dimmer and the reflection component ( i.e. the soft excess ) was stronger .",
    "this is almost certainly a simplified description of the true situation",
    ". one would expect other spectral changes to occur as the power law component varies its distance from the black hole .",
    "for example , with increasing distance the photon index should harden ( i.e. if due to comptonisation ) , ionisation parameter may decrease as the accretion disc is less illuminated , and @xmath91 will probably increase .",
    "as the @xmath9 spectrum of  is dominated by one component and subject to ionised absorption , it would not be surprising if other physical models provided adequate fits . broad - band absorption models , like the blurred absorption models ( e.g. gierlinski & done 2004 ) , have not been examined here , but could likely duplicate the spectrum of .",
    "it may be possible to break this degeneracy by examining the spectral variability , which is complex in  and is somewhat unlike what is seen in other nls1 ( gallo 2007 ) .",
    "in this work , we presented an @xmath0 observation and described the mean spectral and timing characteristics of the agn , as well as compared the data to a previous , shorter  observation from 2002 .",

    "the level of neutral column density intrinsic to  changed , as well as the ionised absorber .",
    "in addition , subtle changes in the continuum shape are apparent .",
    "if modelled with the blurred reflection model , the long - term continuum changes can be understood as arising from different relative contributions of the two continuum components ( i.e. direct power law and ionised reflection ) .",
    "* variability is prevalent in all x - ray bands .",
    "the most distinct structure in the mean light curve is a flux dip @xmath3 into the observation .",
    "average ccfs show a tendency for positive lags meaning soft band changes lead harder bands . however ,",
    "examination of normalised light curves indicate that the high - energy variations are quite structured and lags are only apparent in some parts of the light curve .",
    "interestingly , the hard x - ray lag first appears at the onset of the flux dip in the light curve .",
    "this possible alternating lag has been proposed for another nls1 ( iras  132243809 , gallo 2004b ) and it is not consistent with comptonisation from a single corona with a uniform temperature and optical depth , and variable seed photons . *",
    "the broad ionised fe  line shows significant variations over the course of the 2005 observation , which are not clearly due to intrinsic changes in the fe  -producing region .",
    "other , viewer - perspective effects , such as orbital motion or absorption in the broad iron line - emitting region , could be invoked to describe the variability . *",
    "the broad - line variability during 2002 is re - examined here .",
    "there is evidence suggesting that a relativistically broadened fe  line is produced as a result of a hard x - ray flare illuminating the inner regions ( i.e. @xmath89 ) of the accretion disc .",
