    "the comparison of heavy - flavour hadron production in proton - proton and pb  pb collisions at the lhc offers the opportunity to investigate the properties of the high - density colour - deconfined state of strongly - interacting matter ( quark gluon plasma , qgp ) that is expected to be formed in high - energy collisions of heavy nuclei .",

    "this in - medium energy loss , which is sensitive to the medium energy density , is expected to affect differently heavy quarks , gluons and light quarks . in qcd , quarks have a smaller colour coupling factor with respect to gluons , so that the energy loss for quarks is expected to be smaller than for gluons .",
    "in addition , the ` dead - cone effect ' should reduce small - angle gluon radiation for heavy quarks with moderate energy - over - mass values  @xcite .",

    "<S> the results obtained from the reconstruction of d meson decays at central rapidity and from electrons from heavy - flavour hadron decay will be presented . </S>"
