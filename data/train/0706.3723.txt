    "linear orders play an important role in descriptive complexity theory since certain results relating the expressive power of logics to complexity classes , , the immerman - vardi theorem that captures , only hold for classes of linearly ordered structures . usually , the order only serves to systematically access all elements of the structure , and consequently to encode the configurations of a step - wise advancing computation of a turing machine by tuples of elements of the structure . in these situations",
    "we do not actually want to make statements about the properties of the order , but merely want to have an arbitrary linear order available to express the respective coding techniques .",
    "furthermore , when actually working with finite structures in an algorithmic context , , when evaluating queries in a relational database , we are in fact working on an implicitly ordered structure since , although relations in a database are modelled as _ sets _ of tuples , the relations are nevertheless stored as _ ordered sequences _ of tuples in memory or on a disk . as this linear order is always available ( though , as in the case of databases , it is implementation - dependent and may even change over time as tuples are inserted or deleted ) , we could allow queries to make use of an additional binary predicate that is interpreted as a linear order on the universe of the structure , but require the outcome of the query not to depend on the actual ordering , but to be _ order - invariant_. precisely , given a @xmath0-structure @xmath1 , we allow queries built over an expanded vocabulary @xmath2 , and say that a query @xmath3 is _ order - invariant _ if @xmath4 for all possible relations @xmath5 and @xmath6 linearly ordering @xmath7 .    using -games for mso , one can see that mso on sets ( , structures over an empty vocabulary ) is too weak to express that the universe contains an even number of elements .",
    "however , this is possible if the universe is linearly ordered : simply use the mso sentence stating that the maximal element should be contained in the set of elements on even positions in the ordering .",
    "obviously , such a sentence is order - invariant since rearranging the elements does not affect its truth value .",
    "gurevich uses this observation to show that the property of boolean algebras having an even number of atoms , although not definable in fo , is order - invariantly definable in fo ( simulating the necessary mso - quantification over sets of atoms by fo - quantification over the elements of the boolean algebra ) .",
    "if we explicitly add modulo - counting to mso , , via modulo - counting first - order quantifiers such as `` there exists an even number of elements @xmath8 such that  '' , we obtain _ counting monadic second - order logic _ ( cmso ) , and the question naturally arises as to whether there are properties not expressible in cmso that can be expressed order - invariantly in mso .",
    "in fact , a second separation example due to otto gives a hint in that direction .",
    "the class of structures presented in  @xcite even separates order - invariant fo from fo extended by arbitrary unary generalised quantifiers , , especially modulo - counting quantifiers , and exploits the idea of a part of the structure such that it is only meaningfully usable for queries in presence of a linear order ( or , as actually proven in the paper , in presence of an arbitrary choice function ) .",
    "the expressiveness of cmso has been studied , , in @xcite , where it is mainly compared to , and in @xcite it is shown that , on the class of forests , order - invariant mso is no more expressive than cmso .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , this can be generalised using results in @xcite to classes of structures of bounded tree - width .",
    "but still , this left open courcelle s conjecture : that order - invariant mso is strictly stronger than cmso for general graphs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* conjecture  7.3 ) .    in this paper , we present a suitable characterisation of cmso - definability in terms of an game , and later , as the main contribution , we present a separating example showing that a special class of graphs is indeed definable by an order - invariant mso sentence but not by a counting mso sentence .",

    "we restrict our attention to finite @xmath0-structures with a nonempty universe over a countable relational vocabulary @xmath0 , possibly with constants , and we will mainly deal with monadic second - order logic and some of its extensions . for more details concerning finite model theory , we refer to @xcite or @xcite .",

    "it is an easy observation that every @xmath53 formula is equivalent over the class of all finite structures to an order - invariant formula by translating counting quantifiers in the following way : @xmath54 where @xmath55 defines the successor relation induced by an arbitrary order @xmath48 on the universe of the structure restricted to the set @xmath15 of elements for which @xmath3 holds .",
    "note that the quantifier rank of the translated formula is not constant but bounded by the parameter in the counting quantifier .",
    "the game capturing expressiveness of parameterised by the quantifier - rank ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) can be naturally extended to a game capturing the expressiveness of parameterised by the quantifier rank and the set of moduli being used in the cardinality predicates or counting quantifiers .",
    "viewing as with additional quantifiers @xmath56 for all @xmath57 in a fixed set @xmath13 leads to a new type of move described , , in the context of extending by modulo - counting quantifiers in @xcite .",
    "since a modulo - counting quantifier actually combines notions of a first - order and a monadic second - order quantifier in the sense that it makes a statement about the cardinality of a certain _ set _ of elements , but on the other hand , it behaves like a first - order quantifier binding an _ element _ variable and making a statement about that particular element , the move capturing modulo - counting quantification consists of two phases .",
    "first , spoiler and duplicator select sets of elements  @xmath58 and  @xmath59 in the structures such that @xmath60 , and in the second phase , spoiler and duplicator select elements @xmath61 and @xmath62 such that @xmath63 if and only if @xmath64 . after the move , reflecting the first - order nature of the quantifier , only the two selected elements @xmath61 and @xmath62 are remembered and contribute to the next position in the game , whereas the information about the chosen sets is discarded .",
    "we prefer viewing cmso via second - order cardinality predicates , yielding an game that allows a much clearer description of winning strategies .",
    "since we do not have additional quantifiers , we have exactly the same types of moves as in the game for , and we merely modify the winning condition to take the new predicates into account .    towards this end , we first introduce a suitable concept of partial isomorphisms between structures .    with any structure @xmath1 and any set @xmath65 we associate the ( first - order ) power set structure @xmath66 , where the predicates @xmath43 are interpreted in the obvious way .",
    "( note that first - order predicates in the power set structure @xmath67 naturally correspond to second - order predicates in @xmath1 . )",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath68 be @xmath0-structures , and let @xmath69 be a fixed set of moduli .",

    "note that there is a path following those diagonal edges starting from the bottom - left corner of the grid and ending in the top - right corner if , and only if , the vertical dimension divides the horizontal dimension of the grid .",
    "thus , for our purposes , we have to weaken the structure in the sense that we hide information that remains accessible to -formulae but not to formulae .",
    "an appropriate loss of information is achieved by replacing the two edge relations with their reflexive symmetric transitive closure , , we consider grids as structures with two equivalence relations which provide a notion of _ rows _ and _ columns _ of the grid .",
    "obviously , notions like corner and border vertices as well as the notion of an order on the rows and columns that were important for the mso - definition of the divisibility property are lost , but clearly , all these notions can be regained in presence of an order .",
    "first , the order allows us to uniquely define an element ( the @xmath48-least element ) to be the bottom - left corner of the grid , and second , the order induces successor relations on the set of columns and the set of rows , from which both horizontal and vertical successor vertices of any vertex can be deduced .",
    "since the divisibility property is obviously invariant with respect to the ordering of the rows or columns , this allows for expressing it in .",
