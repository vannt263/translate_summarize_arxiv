    "reaction - diffusion systems posed on multiple spatial scales became recently a powerful modelling and simulation tool @xcite .",
    "conceptually , multiscale models are very much linked to physical scenarios where averaging procedures ( like multiple scales asymptotic expansions , periodic / stochastic homogenization , rev - based methods , renormalization ) fail to bring information in a consistent trustful way up to observable macroscopic scales . often , either due to special geometric sub - structures ( cf .",
    "@xcite , e.g. ) , to separated fast - slow characteristic times ( cf .",
    "@xcite , e.g. ) or to a suitable combination of both such effects , balance laws of extensive physical quantities must be posed on geometries with separated tensor - product space - scale structures ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    by zooming in and out at the position of a continuum collection of material points ,",
    "such models allow for a significant enrichment of a usually rough / coarse macroscopic information from a detailed microscopic picture .",
    "such new multiscale modelling possibilities also open a set of fundamental questions that must be addressed mathematically so that these multiscale models not only get a well - posedness theory , but also are easily accessible through computations .",
    "this is the place where our paper contributes .",
    "we present a two - scale galerkin approach for a particular class of multiscale reaction - diffusion systems with linear coupling between the microscopic and macroscopic variables . exploiting the special structure of the model",
    ", the functions spaces used for the approximation of the solution are chosen as tensor products of spaces on the macroscopic domain and on the standard cell associated to the microstructure .",
    "uniform estimates for the finite dimensional approximations allow us to ensure the convergence of the galerkin approximates .",
    "however , since the zooming in / out must be in principle done for a large number of spatial points of the macroscopic domain to ensure a good quality of the approximation , and moreover , the physics at the microscopic level is quite complex , we are wondering whether we can build mesh refinement strategies in an _ a priori _ fashion to reduce drastically the computational effort up to a minimum level , absolutely needed to trust the simulation output .    in the context of finite element methods , so called _ adaptive mesh refinement strategies _ have been used for a long time .",
    "the idea is very natural : starting from a coarse mesh , one computes the approximate solution and a quantity measuring ( in some sense ) the local error .",
    "one then subdivides those elements of the mesh with large local errors .",
    "practical experience suggest that iterations of such adaptive refinements generally converge .",
    "this was first shown rigorously in the one - dimensional case by babuka and vogelius @xcite using _ a priori _ feedback estimates .",
    "inspired by @xcite , there has been a lot of work on _ a posteriori _ analysis of adaptive finite element methods in higher dimensions ( see the survey @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a feedback scheme in the vein of @xcite for systems of reaction - diffusion equations posed on multiple scales .",
    "as discussed above , such an approach is motivated by the desire to avoid zooming into the micro - structure too often .",
    "the main problem we have to overcome is the fact that the errors of approximation on the two scales are coupled , and it is not clear from the outset how this effects the total error .",
    "our main insight is the fact that the errors on the microscopic scale are in some sense controlled by the macroscopic error .",
    "this allows us to develop a feedback refinement scheme based on _ a priori _ errors on the macroscopic scale that ensures convergence of our approximate solutions .",
    "we note however that we do not obtain any specific rate of convergence for the approximates .",
    "this is to be expected due to the fact that we consider completely general meshes without any special a priori imposed structure .",
    "finally , we want to mention the connection to nonlinear approximation matters .",
    "indeed , galerkin approximation on adaptively generated meshes is an instance of a nonlinear approximation scheme .",
    "it is intuitively clear that an adaptive mesh refinement scheme yields a sequence of meshes where the local errors are , roughly speaking , increasingly equidistributed. in this direction , see the discussion in @xcite and the papers @xcite .",

    "it is worth noting that the coupling between the macroscopic scale and the microscopic scale takes place at two prominent places : on one hand , the coupling is present in the source / sink term in the mass balance equation governing the evolution of @xmath38 , while on the other hand it appears explicitly in the micro - macro flux condition .",
    "the parameter @xmath50 tunes the transport of mass across air - water interfaces , while the parameter @xmath51 ensure the conservation of mass when the information is transmitted between the micro and macro scales and _ vice versa_.      in this subsection we collect all assumptions on the data given above .    1 .
