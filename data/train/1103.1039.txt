    "metal oxides containing 5d transition metal ions provide a wealth of novel magnetic behavior in which orbital , charge and spin degrees of freedom play a rle .",
    "the varied properties observed are due in part to the extended character of the 5d orbitals , reducing the effects of electron correlation",
    ". moreover , the larger spin - orbit coupling in 5d oxides contributes to a balance of competing energy scales substantially different from that in the more familiar 3d transition metal oxides . in this context ,",
    "osmium compounds provide a number of interesting examples .",
    "though oso@xmath0 , sroso@xmath7 and baoso@xmath7 [ all containing os@xmath8 ( 5d@xmath9 ) ] are pauli paramagnets  @xcite , double perovskites of the form ba@xmath0(na ,  li)oso@xmath1 [ containing os@xmath10 ( 5d@xmath11 ) , with ions arranged on a face - centred cubic ( fcc ) lattice ] exhibit mott - insulating , @xmath12 local - moment behaviour @xcite . however , the insulator barium sodium osmate ( ba@xmath13naoso@xmath14 ) has drawn particular attention  @xcite due to its seemingly contradictory combination of negative weiss temperature ( @xmath15 ) and yet weak ferromagnetic moment ( @xmath16 ) below @xmath17 .",
    "this contrasts with the isostructural ba@xmath0lioso@xmath1 , which has both a negative weiss temperature and no ferromagnetic moment @xcite .",

    "the negative weiss constant raises the possibility that the material is a canted antiferromagnet , although first - principles density functional theory electronic structure calculations indicate that a ferromagnetic state has lower energy  @xcite .",
    "the large hybridization between the osmium 5d and oxygen 2p orbitals leads to a very large crystal field splitting ( several ev ) between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands .",
    "it has been suggested that the low moment arises from a partial cancellation of orbital and spin angular momenta in the occupied spin - up @xmath20 band  @xcite . a ferromagnetic phase in ordered double perovskites ( with moments along [ 110 ] ) is also predicted from a mean - field treatment of the orbital - dependent exchange for certain values of parameters in a model hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "an alternative mechanism  @xcite involves the frustration of both the antiferromagnetic interactions and the orbital ordering by the fcc lattice , resulting in a delicate balance of interactions which favors ferromagnetism for ba@xmath0naoso@xmath1 , but antiferromagnetism for ba@xmath0lioso@xmath1 . in view of these competing explanations , further experimental data which can distinguish between different magnetic configurations are desirable .",
