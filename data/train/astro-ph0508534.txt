    "according to the magnetar theory of axps and sgrs @xcite , the high - energy radiation of these slow pulsars ( @xmath2s ) is supplied not by magnetic braking of their rotation , which is insufficient , but from particle acceleration and/or internal heating that is powered by the decay of an enormous magnetic field ( @xmath3  g ) .",
    "the absence of radio emission is a defining characteristic of axps .",
    "radio emission from magnetars has only been seen following impulsive high - energy events from two sgrs .",
    "specifically , a radio source detected within a few days of the intense 1998  august  27 @xmath4-ray burst from sgr  1900 + 14 faded rapidly during the following month @xcite .",
    "the giant flare of sgr  1806@xmath520 on 2004  december  27 @xcite was accompanied by a radio source that exhibited a complex decay @xcite .",
    "no radio transient has been recorded from an axp , e.g. , after a bursting episode of 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite , and no _ persistent _ radio emission , whether compact or extended , has been clearly attributed to an axp or an sgr .",
    "the transient axp  is a 5.54  s x - ray pulsar discovered by @xcite using the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _",
    "( _ rxte _ ) , and located to subarcsecond precision by _",
    "chandra _  and infrared counterpart detections @xcite .",
    "when discovered in a high state , the source was already decaying exponentially with a time constant of @xmath6  days @xcite from a recorded maximum flux @xmath7 ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath9 .",
    "the onset and initial properties of the outburst were not observed , but _ rxte _",
    "scans restrict the epoch of the event to between 2002 november and 2003 january .",
    "archival x - ray detections of the previously anonymous source indicate a steady quiescent state with flux two orders - of - magnitude less than the maximum measured value .",
    "detailed interpretation of the decaying x - ray outburst of  using _ xmm - newton _ , as well as its historical x - ray properties , were reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "this letter presents a unique vla detection of  1  year after its x - ray outburst , and upper limits from other archival vla data that restrict its spectrum and pattern of variability .",
    "possible origins of the radio emission are explored , and comparisons are made to upper limits from other axps , and to transient radio detections that followed outbursts of sgrs .",
    "although the distance to  is highly uncertain , we adopt here @xmath10  kpc following the argument in @xcite .",
    "this is a revision of the larger estimates used in earlier papers .",
    "observations at 1.4  ghz of the region containing   were obtained on several days in 2004 january as part of the vla multi - array galactic plane imaging survey ( magpis ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) a total of 15 min of exposure were accumulated in b configuration , with a resulting beam @xmath11 and rms sensitivity 0.5  mjy per beam .",

    "the difference is comparable to the combined astrometric uncertainty of both instruments .",
    "since the radio source is the only one within a @xmath17 radius of the pulsar , the probability that it is a chance coincidence of an unrelated object within a radius of @xmath16 can be estimated at @xmath18 , and the identification on the basis of position alone is compelling .",
    "the radio source extent is unresolved , from which we infer an upper limit on its intrinsic radius of @xmath19 , or @xmath20  cm , where @xmath21 is the distance in units of 2.5  kpc .",
    "we then analyzed several vla observations from earlier galactic plane surveys @xcite and other archival data , with results listed in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "only upper limits are obtained from these observations , including the ones reported by @xcite .",
    "when quoted at the @xmath22 level , nearly all of the upper limits are higher than the single detection .",
    "therefore , they contain little information about intrinsic variability of the source . however , two vla upper limits obtained in 2003 , following the x - ray outburst of , restrict an hypothesized power - law decay to @xmath23 or slower .",
    "the upper limit of 3.6  mjy in 2004 march is then in mild conflict with the detection in 2004 january .",
    "if , on the other hand , the source is truly constant , then the spectrum from @xmath24  ghz can not be fitted with a single power law of the form @xmath25 .",
    "the upper limit of 1  mjy at 4.8  ghz requires @xmath26 between 1.4 and 4.8  ghz , while the upper limit of 10.5  mjy at 330  mhz requires @xmath27 between 330  mhz and 1.4  ghz .",
    "the implied spectral curvature might be intrinsic , or the onset of self absorption ; alternatively , variability is required .",
    "we also inspected the magpis 1.4  ghz b configuration image for another transient axp candidate ,  @xcite , which yields a @xmath22 upper limit of 0.5  mjy for a point source at r.a .",

    "this 6.97  s pulsar associated with a supernova remnant @xcite remains only a candidate axp because its period derivative has not yet been measured due to a dramatic reduction in its x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "no radio pulsations have been detected from axps , with pulsed flux density limits @xmath30  mjy at 1.4  ghz obtained for most sources @xcite .",
    "it is not yet established by statistics alone whether the small set of axps are intrinsically radio quiet or just unfavorably oriented , their long periods implying small active polar caps and narrow beams . neither has persistent radio emission been seen from this class until now ,",
    "although flux limits from interferometric imaging , listed in table  [ compare ] , are generally not as deep as the single - dish searches for pulsed flux .",
    "although the vla source associated with  is spatially unresolved , the bulk of its flux is unlikely to be due to magnetospheric pulsar emission .",
    "a 4.5  mjy source pulsed at the 5.54  s x - ray period should be easily detected in the parkes multibeam pulsar survey operating at 1.4  ghz , as have other long - period , high @xmath31-field pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that are at least an order - of - magnitude fainter .",
    "therefore , we assume that most of the emission is incoherent synchrotron radiation arising from well outside the light cylinder , @xmath32  cm , but within the vla resolution limit @xmath33  cm .",
    "its brightness temperature is then @xmath34  k , and it is probably larger than @xmath35  cm , assuming that @xmath36  k.    to put the unique radio detection of  in context , we note that its radio flux density is larger than all of the upper limits from other axps ( table  [ compare ] ) , but its radio luminosity is demonstrably larger than only two or three , considering that the distances to axps , as tabulated by @xcite and @xcite , may be uncertain by a factor of 2 . the radio detection of  may be a significant clue into the physics of its class",
    ".  differs from other axps in two respects .",
    "first , it is transient , with an x - ray luminosity that is comparable to the persistent axps only near the peak of its outburst .",
    "second , its quiescent state may be long - lived , so that its time - averaged x - ray luminosity could be two orders - of - magnitude less than the others .",
    "the only other transient x - ray source in table  [ compare ] is , but its distance is uncertain and possibly large @xcite , so its radio luminosity is not necessarily smaller than that of .    an obvious hypothesis , that the 2004 january radio luminosity of  is a transient afterglow that originated with the 2003 january x - ray outburst , is problematic .",
    "first , there is the twice documented absence of a more luminous radio source in the months following the x - ray outburst , in 2003 february and april .",
    "it is also notable that no radio source , to a limit of @xmath37jy , was detected 2 days after an x - ray outburst and glitch of the axp 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite .",
    "second , there was no evidence for any soft @xmath4-ray outburst from  resembling the flares of the sgrs , only a slowly decaying , thermal x - ray spectrum that integrated over a time scale of 300 days to a total energy of @xmath38 ergs @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is possible that  was _ never _ more luminous than a normal axp .",
    "its activity is perhaps better characterized as a turn - on than an outburst , and is in marked contrast to the @xmath39 ergs @xmath4-ray flare of sgr 1806@xmath520 in 2004 december @xcite .",
    "third , only in the aftermath of giant flares from the sgr 1806@xmath520 and 1900 + 14 have decaying radio sources been detected by the vla , and even these were faint and short - lived . in the case of sgr 1900 + 14 ,",
    "the peak 1.4  ghz flux density 10 days after the 1998 august flare was 0.7  mjy @xcite , but it decayed as a power law of index @xmath40 and was no longer detectable after 1  month .",
    "just 1.6 days after another burst activation from sgr 1900 + 14 in 2001 april , no radio emission was detected to a @xmath41 limit of 0.45 mjy at 5  ghz @xcite , which was not unexpected since the @xmath4-ray fluence of the 2001 burst was 25 times smaller than the 1998 burst .",
    "the 2004 december giant flare from sgr 1806@xmath520 produced a radio source initially detected at 178 mjy at 1.4  ghz , which faded to 10 mjy after 50 days @xcite .",
    "extrapolated to 1  year , sgr 1806@xmath520 should be as faint in the radio as  was 1  year after its x - ray turn - on .",
    "this despite the fact that the @xmath4-ray flare of sgr 1806@xmath520 was three orders - of - magnitude more luminous than the entire extrapolated x - ray luminosity of  from the peak of its turn - on to the present time .    for the sake of completeness",
    ", we note that at least the kinematic properties of the sgr events are not incompatible with the size of the  radio source .",
    "if we assume that the radio emitting plasma observed in 2004 january was first ejected from the neutron star a year earlier , then we can place an upper limit on the ejection velocity , @xmath42 .",
    "this is comparable to the velocity directly estimated in the case of sgr 1806@xmath520 from its resolved vla images , @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "if the radio emission from  is not a transient afterglow , it may be caused by a variable wind of high - energy particles , which we hypothesize could be responsible for powering a small synchrotron emitting nebula under favorable circumstances .",
    "the spin - down rates of axps fluctuate by a large factor , which is taken as evidence that rotational energy is regularly removed by mechanisms other than dipole braking , e.g. , a particle wind @xcite .",
    "continued monitoring by _ rxte _  and _ xmm - newton _  shows that the spin - down rate of  varies irregularly by at least a factor of 4 , with @xmath44  s  s@xmath9 @xcite . assuming a moment of inertia @xmath45",
    "g  @xmath46 , this implies the possibility of a wind of luminosity @xmath47 ergs  s@xmath9 , which is comparable to the quiescent thermal x - ray luminosity @xcite , and five orders - of - magnitude larger than the radio luminosity @xmath48 ergs  s@xmath9 at 1.4  ghz .",
    "in addition , _ rxte _  continued to find small x - ray bursts from  long after its initial outburst .",
    "@xcite document four such bursts in 2003 september , 2004 february , and 2004 may , from a total exposure time of 9 days .",
    "although these have thermal spectra and blackbody radii much smaller than the surface area of a neutron star , their temperatures of 48  kev imply local flux greater than the eddington value . whether their initial trigger is magnetic reconnection or crust fracturing , they likely cause matter to be ejected from the surface .",
    "the strongest of these bursts had a energy of @xmath49 ergs , and together they emitted @xmath50 ergs .",
    "therefore we can estimate a time - averaged luminosity in bursts of @xmath51 ergs  s@xmath9 , which is two orders - of - magnitude less than the estimated wind luminosity .",
    "it is possible that long - lived radio emission is powered by the accumulated plasma ejected in the process of creating the x - ray bursts , as well as by the more luminous wind .",
    "following the arguments of @xcite and @xcite , the conversion of the ubiquitous pulsar winds to an observable pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) may be limited not by the energy carried in the wind , but by the environment  specifically , by whether the ambient pressure is large enough to shock the wind and confine the nebula . in the case of",
    ", balancing the assumed wind power @xmath52 ergs  s@xmath9 at a termination shock radius @xmath53  cm requires a pressure @xmath54 dynes  @xmath8 .",
    "this is a rather modest value even if the true radius of the nebula is only @xmath55  cm and the pressure is @xmath56 dynes  @xmath8 , or alternatively , if the wind power has been 100 times larger than assumed here . in comparison , @xcite showed that the radius of the vela pwn is consistent with the thermal pressure in the surrounding hot supernova remnant , @xmath57 dynes  @xmath8 measured from x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding , which may imply that the surrounding temperature is cooler .",
    "if we assume an ionized medium of @xmath58  k , then the required hydrogen density is @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the actual development of a pwn is a time - dependent process , with a forward shock radius estimated as @xmath61 @xcite . for the numerical values assumed here , @xmath62",
    "cm is reached in @xmath63  years .",
    "alternatively , if the pulsar s space velocity @xmath64 exceeds @xmath65 , then a bow - shock nebula will form with apex radius @xmath66 that is smaller than @xmath67 for a `` static '' nebula .",
    "we note that the radio emitting efficiency of , as defined by @xcite and @xcite , is comparable to the upper limits obtained by them for rotation - powered pulsars of similar @xmath68 as we are assuming for the wind of . therefore , evidence is lacking that the average wind power of is much greater than its spin - down value .",
    "additionally , there is no x - ray pwn around , whose image is consistent with a point - source at the _ chandra _  resolution of fwhm @xmath69 @xcite . only pulsars with @xmath70 ergs  s@xmath9 have x - ray pwne @xcite .",
    "perhaps the difference between  and other magnetars is that  is surrounded by a dense medium , while the past activity of the other , more energetic magnetars , has disrupted and evacuated their surroundings .",
    "we note that this is different from the hypothesis advanced by @xcite to explain an apparent cavity around axp 1e  1048.1@xmath55937 , which they supposed was blown by the wind of its massive progenitor star .",
    "the detection of radio emission from an axp comes as a surprise because it is contrary to a defining property of its class . but the physical basis of the classification of  is unchanged . the long period , unsteady spin - down , x - ray luminosity exceeding its spin - down power , and detailed properties of its two - component x - ray spectrum , are all squarely in the axp mold , and support the magnetar interpretation @xcite .",
    "although the radio luminosity of  is energetically insignificant , a more detailed investigation of its origin could lead to a better understanding of the evolution of axps and their immediate surroundings .",
    "the spectral and spatial structure of this compact radio source can be studied with multifrequency observations in the vla a configuration , which has the potential to resolve the source if it is a pwn powered by a wind of comparable luminosity to the x - ray luminosity or the spin - down power . if size and spectral information are obtained , the particle and magnetic field energies of this presumed synchrotron source can be determined .",
    "while the evidence for temporal variability is marginal , variability would not be unexpected , as the x - ray source is still declining from its 2003 january turn - on .",
    "a monitoring program can study the relationship , if any , of the radio structure and luminosity to the x - ray history .",
    "however , it is possible that the environment and the normal x - ray quiescence of , rather than its unusual outburst , is what enables it to support a radio source .",
    "having suggested that is the prototype of a major subclass of young pulsars that may have been detected but not yet recognized in quiescence @xcite , we now anticipate the prospect of an additional marker , in the form of a compact radio source , that will aid in their discovery .",
