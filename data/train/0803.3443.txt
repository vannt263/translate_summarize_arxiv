    "dna replication in prokaryotes gets initiated by unzipping of a few base pairs at one end of the dsdna and then continues till end .",
    "these processes are assisted by various enzymes , often by exerting force on dna  @xcite .",
    "it is now known theoretically , that a dsdna undergoes an unzipping transition under the action of an external force if the force exceeds a temperature dependent critical value  @xcite .",
    "many studies of this unzipping transition  @xcite have revealed the importance of ensembles namely , the fixed distance and the fixed force ensemble  @xcite . for the fixed distance case ,",
    "the distance between the strands is kept constant and the force required to maintain the distance is allowed to fluctuate , whose average is the quantity of interest , whereas , the average of the fluctuating distance between the strands where an external force is acting is the quantity of interest in the fixed force ensemble . for the single molecule studies ,",
    "the results are known to depend on the ensemble used  @xcite .",
    "the helicases work in both the fixed distance and the fixed force ensembles  @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the unzipping transition has been studied in detail with various extensions of the basic model .",
    "these include studies of models with intermediate phases  @xcite , dependence on pulling directions  @xcite , models with additional features like semiflexibility  @xcite , heterogeneity  @xcite , saturation of hydrogen bonding  @xcite , random forcing  @xcite etc .",
    "a similar problem of unzipping of an adsorbed polymer from the surface has also been studied  @xcite .",
    "experimental studies use various micro - manipulation techniques  @xcite . in all of these studies ,",
    "the focus was on the breaking of the pairing by the external force .",
    "a more complicated situation emerges in dna replication and segregation ( e.g. in _ bacillus subtilis , e. coli _ etc . ) , where the membrane - dna complexes play an important role  @xcite .",
    "for example , in bacillus subtilis , the dnab protein has been shown to be a membrane - associated protein that is involved in initiation of replication  @xcite .",
    "also , it is known that the interaction between the dna and the membrane can form ordered domains  @xcite .",
    "analogous laboratory situation would involve a substrate - dna interaction .",
    "recently atomic force microscopy has been used to identify the binding mechanism between the dna and the dna - binding agents by pulling one end of the dsdna , which is immobilized on a gold surface in the presence of dna - binding agents  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "our aim is to study a simple model of unzipping of a dsdna by applying an external force on a single strand in the transverse direction .",
    "can a dsdna be unzipped ?",
    "within the same framework , we also study the behaviour of the dsdna in the presence of an attractive surface near it .",
    "this surface can mimic a membrane on which the dna can be immobilized . since adsorption of a polymer ( here",
    "a dsdna or a single strand of dsdna ) is a phase transition by itself ( often critical ) , the competition between adsorption and unzipping is expected to add new features to the unzipping phase diagram .    the presence of the additional dna substrate interaction both _ in - vivo _ and _ in - vitro _ system requires a different extension of the hitherto used models for the unzipping transition .",
    "a helical structure could pose extra problems for surface adsorption . in order to focus on the competition between adsorption and pairing",
    ", we use an extension of the poland - scheraga ( ps ) model  @xcite in two dimensions .",
    "previous studies of dna unzipping showed that the lattice model preserves , even in two dimensions , the basic results of dna unzipping including the first order nature of the phase transition and the existence of a reentrant region  @xcite .",
    "for the problem at hand , we have also done monte carlo simulations in 2 + 1 dimensions , though without considering the helical structure of dna , but the strands can wind together because of the dynamics , and find that the force - distance isotherms are qualitatively similar to the isotherms obtained in 1 + 1 dimensions .    at this point it is worthwhile to mention a few caveats of our approach . to achieve simplicity and tractability",
    ", we ignored the helical structure of dsdna .",
    "the main obstacle in incorporating it is the absence as yet of any analytically tractable models for dna melting that admits a helical ground state . in this situation",
    ", a ps type model serves as the starting point .",
    "we will see that if the base pairing energy of the dna is greater than the binding to the surface , the unzipping of dsdna by pulling a single strand takes place when it is away from the surface .",
    "since the other strand of the dna is left free , it can unwind itself from the pulled strand and the helical structure of the dna can be safely neglected .",
    "however , in the opposite limit , the helical structure of the dna becomes more and more crucial as the strength of binding to the surface is increased and its role can no longer be neglected .",
    "another feature that may play an important role is the difference in the length per base pair of dsdna and single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) .",
    "since it is difficult to incorporate this in a ps type lattice model considered in this paper , but can be done in continuous models , we ignore it in the present study .    among the new features we find",
    "is the existence of a critical end point ( cep )  @xcite , and the triple point  @xcite in the force versus temperature phase diagram for sufficiently strong attraction with the substrate . for weaker attraction",
    ", certain phases may not be thermodynamically stable .",
    "some of the details of the cep have been reported in a shorter paper  @xcite .",
    "here we give all the necessary details and calculations and focus on the triple point .",
    "we use the generating function , the exact transfer matrix and monte carlo simulations to explore the equilibrium behaviour of this dna - substrate system under a force on one strand .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we define our model . section  [ sec : polymer ] is devoted to two extreme limits in which the problem reduces to the unzipping of adsorbed polymer from a straight and a zig zag hard - wall .",

    "in contrast , the interplay between the binding energy @xmath41 , and the entropy , which the free strand can gain if it is in the unzipped phase , is responsible for the single chain case . when @xmath133 , the binding energy wins over the entropy and the dna remains in the zipped phase for any value of @xmath11 . for large @xmath11 ,",

    "there are other factors that also contribute in the unzipping of dsdna by pulling a single strand but neglected in our lattice model .",
    "an important one is the fact that the length per base pair of the dsdna and the ssdna are different ( 0.34 nm and around 0.5mn respectively ) . if the applied force is low , the dsdna has larger extension than the ssdna and the dsdna remains stable .",
