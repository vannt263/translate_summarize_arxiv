    "this paper is concerned with a typical spectrum sharing scenario for wireless communication , where a secondary radio , also commonly known as the _ cognitive radio _ ( cr ) , communicates over the same bandwidth that has been allocated to an existing primary radio ( pr ) .",
    "for such a scenario , the cr usually needs to deal with a fundamental tradeoff between maximizing its own transmission throughput and minimizing the amount of interference caused to the pr transmission .",
    "there are in general three types of methods known in the literature for the cr to deal with such a tradeoff .",
    "one is the so - called _ opportunistic spectrum access _ ( osa ) , originally outlined in @xcite and later formally introduced by darpa , whereby the cr decides to transmit over the pr spectrum only when the pr transmission is detected to be off ; while the other two methods allow the cr to transmit over the spectrum simultaneously with the pr .",
    "one of them is based on the `` cognitive relay '' idea @xcite , @xcite . for this method",
    ", the cr transmitter is assumed to know perfectly all the channels from cr / pr transmitter to pr and cr receivers and , furthermore , the pr s message prior to the pr transmission .",
    "thereby , the cr transmitter is able to send messages to its own receiver and , at the same time , compensate for the resultant interference to the pr receiver by operating as an assisting relay to the pr transmission .",
    "in contrast , the other method only requires that the power gain of the channel from cr transmitter to pr receiver is known to the cr transmitter and , thereby , the cr is allowed to transmit regardless of the pr s on / off status provided that the resultant interference power level at the pr receiver is kept below some predefined threshold , also known as the _ interference - temperature _ constraint @xcite , @xcite . in this paper , we focus our study on this method due to its many advantages from an implementation viewpoint .",
    "to enable wireless spectrum sharing under the interference - temperature constraint , _ dynamic resource allocation _ ( dra ) for the cr becomes crucial , whereby the transmit power level , bit - rate , bandwidth , and antenna beam of the cr are dynamically changed based upon the channel state information ( csi ) available at the cr transmitter . for the single - antenna fading pr and cr channels , transmit power control for the cr has been studied in @xcite , @xcite under the average / peak interference - power constraint at the pr receiver based upon the csi on the channels from the cr transmitter to the cr and pr receivers , in @xcite under the combined interference - power constraint and the cr s own transmit - power constraint , and in @xcite , @xcite based upon the additional csi on the pr fading channel . on the other hand ,",
    "for the multi - antenna pr and cr channels , in @xcite the authors proposed both optimal and suboptimal spatial adaptation schemes for the cr transmitter .",
    "information - theoretic limits for multiuser multi - antenna / fading cr channels have also been studied in , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .    in this paper , we consider the single - antenna fading pr and cr channels .",
    "for such scenarios , the interference - power constraint at the pr receiver is usually one of the following two types : one is the _ long - term _ constraint that regulates the _ average _ interference power ( aip ) over all the fading states , while the other is the _ short - term _ one that limits the _ peak _ interference power ( pip ) at each of the fading states .",
    "clearly , the pip constraint is more restrictive than the aip counterpart given the same average and peak interference - power threshold . from the cr s perspective",
    ", the aip constraint is more favorable than the pip , since the former provides the cr more flexibility for dynamically allocating transmit powers over the fading states and , thus , achieves larger fading channel capacities @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of the aip- and pip - based cr power control on the pr transmissions has not yet been studied in the literature , to the author s best knowledge . at a first glance",
    ", the more restrictive pip constraint seems to be a better option than the aip from the perspective of protecting the pr .",
    "some surprisingly , in this paper the contrary conclusion is rigourously shown , i.e. , the aip constraint is indeed superior over the pip in terms of various forms of capacity limits achievable for the pr fading channel , e.g. , the ergodic and outage capacities .",
    "this result is due to an interesting _ interference diversity _",
    "phenomenon for the pr transmission : due to the convexity of the capacity function with respect to the noise / interferecne power , more randomized interference powers over the fading states at the pr receiver in the aip case are more advantageous over deterministic ones in the pip case for minimizing the resultant pr capacity losses .",
    "therefore , this paper provides an important design rule for the cr networks in practice , i.e. , the aip constraint may result in improved fading channel capacities over the pip for both the cr and pr transmissions .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : channel model ] presents the system model for spectrum sharing .",
    "section [ sec : secondary user capacity ] considers the cr link and summarizes the results known in the literature on the cr fading channel capacities and the corresponding optimal power - control policies under the aip or the pip constraint .",
    "section [ sec : primary user capacity ] then studies various forms of the pr fading channel capacities under the interference from the cr transmitter due to the aip- or pip - based cr power control , and proves that the aip constraint results in larger channel capacities than the pip for the same power threshold .",
    "section [ sec : simulation results ] considers both pr and cr transmissions and shows the simulation results on their jointly achievable capacities under spectrum sharing .",

    "it is assumed that the channel power gains @xmath19 and @xmath18 are perfectly known at cr - tx for each @xmath17 .",

    "the aip constraint regulates the average interference power at pr - rx over all the fading states and is thus expressed as @xmath36\\leq \\gamma_{a } \\ \\ { \\rm or } \\ \\",
    "\\mathbb{e}[g_ip_i]\\leq \\gamma_{a}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 denotes the predefined aip threshold .",
    "in contrast , the pip constraint limits the peak interference power at pr - rx at each of the fading states and is thus expressed as @xmath38 where @xmath39 denotes the predefined pip threshold .",
    "note that the pip constraint is in general more restrictive over the aip .",
    "this can be easily seen by observing that given @xmath40 , ( [ eq : pip ] ) implies ( [ eq : aip ] ) but not vice versa .",
    "therefore , from the cr s perspective , applying the aip constraint is more favorable than the pip because the former provides the cr more flexibility for adapting transmit powers over the fading states .    in this paper , we consider two well - known capacity limits for the fading pr and cr channels , namely , the ergodic capacity and the outage capacity .",
    "the ergodic capacity measures the maximum average rate over the fading states @xcite , while the resultant mutual information for each fading state can be variable .",
    "in contrast , the outage capacity measures the maximum constant rate that is achievable over each of the fading states with a guaranteed outage probability @xcite , @xcite . in the extreme case of zero outage probability",
    ", the outage capacity is also known as the delay - limited capacity @xcite . in general , the ergodic and delay - limited capacities can be considered as the throughput limits for a fading channel with no and with minimal transmission delay requirement , respectively .",
    "in this section , we summarize the results known in the literature on the cr fading channel capacities and the corresponding optimal power - control policies under the aip or the pip constraint .",
    "consider first the aip case .",

    "note that the above power control resembles the well - known `` water filling ( wf ) '' power control @xcite , @xcite , which achieves the ergodic capacity of the conventional fading channel , whereas there is also a key difference here : in ( [ eq : power aip er ] ) , the so - called `` water level '' for wf , @xmath44 , depends on the channel power gain @xmath19 from cr - tx to pr - rx as compared to being a constant in the standard wf power control . substituting ( [ eq : power aip er ] ) into @xmath45 given in ( [ eq : cr mi ] ) and taking the expectation of the resultant @xmath45 over @xmath17",
    ", we obtain the ergodic capacity for the cr under the aip constraint , denoted as @xmath46 . on the other hand ,",
    "the optimal @xmath31 to achieve the outage capacity of the cr fading channel with a guaranteed outage probability , @xmath47 , is expressed as @xcite , @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is a nonnegative constant determined from @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is the constant signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at cr - rx obtained from @xmath52=\\gamma_a$ ] .",
    "note that the above power control resembles the well - known `` truncated channel inversion ( tci ) '' power control @xcite to achieve the outage capacity of the conventional fading channel @xcite , while there is also a difference between ( [ eq : power aip out ] ) and the standard tci on the threshold value @xmath49 for power truncation ( no transmission ) : in ( [ eq : power aip out ] ) @xmath49 depends on the ratio between @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as compared to only @xmath18 in the standard tci .",
    "the corresponding outage capacity , denoted as @xmath53 , is then obtained as @xmath54 . note that if @xmath55 , it then follows that @xmath56 and the resultant power - control policy in ( [ eq : power aip out ] ) becomes the `` channel inversion ( ci ) '' power control @xcite , which achieves the delay - limited capacity for the cr @xcite , denoted as @xmath57 .",
    "consider next the pip case .",
    "it is easy to show that in this case the optimal @xmath31 should use the maximum possible transmit power for each fading state @xmath17 so as to maximize both the ergodic and the outage capacities , is known at cr - tx for each @xmath17 , it is possible for the cr power control to assign a smaller power value @xmath58 than @xmath59 if the former happens to be smaller than the latter for some @xmath17 .",
    "however , if @xmath18s are not available at cr - tx , it is optimal for the cr to assign the maximum possible transmit power @xmath59 for each @xmath17 to minimize the outage probability .",

    "the resultant outage probability , @xmath63 , can be shown equal to @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the constant snr at cr - rx . for a given @xmath63 ,",
    "the corresponding @xmath65 can thus be obtained , as well as the corresponding outage capacity , @xmath66 .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath55 , it follows that @xmath67 and thus the delay - limited capacity for the cr under the pip constraint , denoted as @xmath68 , is always zero .    comparing the power allocations in ( [ eq : power aip er ] ) and ( [ eq : power aip out ] ) for the aip case with those in ( [ eq : power pip ] ) for the pip case , it is easy to see that the former power allocations are more flexible than the latter ones over the fading states .",
    "furthermore , the aip - based power control depends on both the channel power gains , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while the pip - based power control only depends on @xmath19 . as a result , under the same average and peak power threshold , i.e. , @xmath69 , it is easy to show that @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the aip is superior over the pip in terms of the fading channel capacity limits achievable for the cr .",
    "in this section , we will present the main contributions of this paper on the comparison of the effects of aip and pip constraints on various fading channel capacities for the pr . for fair comparison ,",
    "we consider the same average and peak interference - power threshold , i.e. , @xmath73 .",

    "the simplest power control for the pr is the _ constant - power _ ( cp ) policy , i.e. , @xmath76 cp is an attractive scheme in practice from an implementation viewpoint since it does not require any csi on the pr fading channel at pr - tx .",

    "as shown in the above proof , this result is mainly due to the convexity of the capacity function with respect to the noise / interference power .",
    "we thus name this interesting phenomenon for the pr transmission in a cr network as `` interference diversity '' .",
