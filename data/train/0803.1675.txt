    "the cluster rcs231953 + 0038.0 was discovered in the first red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs-1 , @xcite ) and displays spectacular strong lensing features @xcite . as such",
    ", it has been the subject of extensive follow - up , including multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) @xcite and _ chandra _ x - ray imaging @xcite .",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations were targeted so as to include two other cluster candidates ( rcs231848 + 0030.1 and rcs232002 + 0033.4 ) which the rcs catalog indicated were consistent with being at the same photometric redshift as the primary cluster target .",
    "all three systems were found to be coincident with extended x - ray emission @xcite . in this letter",
    "we present new follow - up spectroscopy of these three clusters , showing that all three are located at the same redshift and therefore likely physically associated .",
    "hereafter we refer to these collectively as the supercluster rcs2319 + 00 .    throughout",
    ", we assume a concordance cosmology with @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 km s@xmath10  mpc@xmath10 .",
    "wide - field mos spanning a field of 27  diameter using imacs on the 6.5-m baade telescope was obtained on the night of 2006 october 28 - 29 .",
    "the observations consisted of 4 @xmath11 1800s exposures of a single mask comprising 725 slits utilizing a custom band - limiting filter , which restricted the wavelength coverage to 6050 - 8580 , allowing coverage of the key spectral features from [ oii]@xmath123727 to g - band ( @xmath13 ) and somewhat beyond , at the redshift of the cluster .",
    "the spectra were reduced following a technique similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we used the cosmos software packageoemler / cosmos.html ] to process the 2d spectra .",
    "our procedure required the additional step of masking second and third order bright skyline contamination , which overlapped many of our first order science spectra due to the highly multi - tiered nature of our data .",
    "the spectra were extracted to 1d using the apall task in iraf .",
    "redshifts were measured using the iraf task rvsao .",
    "all the spectra were visually inspected and assigned redshift confidences based on the system described in @xcite .",
    "hereafter we group redshifts with quality flags 1 - 3 into a higher confidence category ( 302 objects ) and denote class 4 redshifts as lower confidence ( 113 objects ) .",
    "the redshift histograms for all galaxies in this field are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fullhist ] . also included are 16 redshifts centered on rcs231953 + 0038.0 from vlt spectroscopy @xcite . a clear peak is seen at z@xmath20.9 . the insets show histograms within 3.2 arcmins ( 1.5 mpc ) of each cluster center .",
    "the properties of the three clusters are summarized in table [ table : props ] and we refer to the three clusters as a , b , c , as denoted in the table . fig .",
    "[ fig : sigmap ] shows the sky distribution of all spectroscopically observed galaxies within the imacs field .",
    "although the field is sparsely sampled , overdensities of spectroscopic members can be seen around the locations of the most significant peaks in the rcs significance map ( see @xcite ) .",

    "we obtained deep spectroscopy of the @xmath25-band dropout arc ( fig .",
    "2c , @xcite ) in 2003 september - october using gmos - n on gemini - north ( program i d : gn-2003-q-19 ) .",
    "the target was observed in nod - and - shuffle mode for a total integration time of 9.6 hours and the data reduced as for the gemini data described in @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the arc is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arc ] and is that of a high - redshift lyman - break galaxy ( lbg ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , lbgs frequently display strong outflows , and so the measurement of a redshift is complicated by different spectral features tracing kinematically distinct components of the galaxy . in order to determine a systemic redshift , we use only stellar photospheric lines and plot their positions at different trial redshifts over the spectrum .",
    "we find a redshift of z@xmath03.8605 .",
    "other common lines from interstellar absorption and nebular emission , etc .  are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : arc ] .",
    "ly@xmath26 is seen offset to higher redshift ( @xmath2900 km s@xmath10 ) with respect to the systemic velocity , as is often observed @xcite .",
    "the x - ray observations and analysis are described in @xcite and are derived from four _ chandra _ observations taken over the period 2005 september 28 - october 23 , resulting in a total exposure of 74,539 seconds .",
    "briefly , x - ray temperatures were measured within @xmath27 and used to derive total masses by extrapolating to @xmath28 .",
    "the x - ray masses for all three clusters are given in table  [ table : props ] and each is around 5@xmath1110@xmath29 .      cluster a has sufficient spectroscopic members ( by including the additional vlt data ) to measure an approximate velocity dispersion .",
    "12 redshift class 1 - 4 members yield @xmath30 km s@xmath10  or 9 higher confidence ( class 1 - 3 ) members yield @xmath31 km s@xmath10 .",
    "these velocity dispersions would correspond to virial mass estimates @xcite of @xmath32 m@xmath6 and @xmath33 m@xmath6 , which are in good agreement with the x - ray derived mass of @xmath34 m@xmath6 , within the broad uncertainties of the dynamical estimate . using the richness ",
    "dynamical mass relation established at lower - redshift @xcite , the b@xmath35  values of clusters a - c would correspond to expected masses of m@xmath36 10@xmath37 m@xmath6 respectively .",
    "the 1@xmath38 intrinsic scatter in the observed relation is @xmath20.7 dex @xcite and thus the inferred masses are consistent with the measured x - ray masses within this broad scatter .",
    "we can use the radial distance and redshift of the strongly - lensed z@xmath03.8605 galaxy to make an estimate of the mass of cluster a within this radius .",
    "a simple circular fit to the position of the arc with respect to the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) shows that it lies at a radius of @xmath212   ( 0.1 mpc ) . setting this equal to the einstein radius and assuming that the density profile of the cluster is that of an isothermal sphere would imply a central velocity dispersion of 860 km s@xmath10[using @xmath39 , e.g. , @xcite ] . using @xmath40 km s@xmath41 mpc@xmath42",
    "@xcite gives an estimate of the mass enclosed within this radius as @xmath43 .",
    "recalculating the x - ray mass within a cylinder of radius 0.1 mpc , to be directly comparable to the lensing mass estimate , gives a mass of @xmath44 , in excellent agreement with that inferred from the simple strong lensing estimate .",
    "the separations of the components of this system , both in the plane of the sky ( @xmath45 3 mpc ) and along the line of sight ( @xmath210 mpc , assuming that the velocity difference is due to hubble flow ) are significantly closer than those seen in other supercluster candidates at these redshifts @xcite .",
    "this invites the question : will these merge to form a more massive cluster ? to answer this , we consider a simple estimate @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the clusters are not moving apart with the hubble flow and that their relative velocity is comparable to their restframe los velocity difference ( @xmath21200 km s@xmath10 ) , then the time taken to traverse the @xmath23 mpc separation would imply that the individual cluster components would merge by z@xmath20.5 .",
    "the merger redshift is also comparable if we assume that the infall velocity is of the order of the velocity dispersion of cluster a. thus , this system would evolve into a cluster of mass @xmath46 10@xmath47 m@xmath6 at z@xmath20.5 , similar to the z@xmath00.54 cluster ms0451.5 - 0305 @xcite .",
    "we explore the expected space density of such systems by utilizing the cluster catalogs from the light cone output of the virgo consortium hubble volume simulation @xcite .",
    "since the abundance of superclusters depends sensitively on the mass threshold chosen , we adopt the conservative approach of searching for clusters of 3.3@xmath1110@xmath37 m@xmath6 ( the 1@xmath38 lower limit for the cluster with the lowest x - ray mass ) within similar separations . in one octant of the sky",
    ", we find only one such system in the redshift range 0.8 to 1.0 , corresponding to a surface density of @xmath48 per sq .",
    "we should therefore have a probability of @xmath452% of finding such an object in the 92 deg@xmath49 of rcs-1 , if the hubble volume simulation gives an accurate description of the abundance of structure . relaxing the maximum separation requirement slightly to 10 mpc ( which is the maximum inferred spatial separation if the los velocity difference is due to cosmic expansion ) ,",
    "we find five such triple clusters , corresponding to a surface density of @xmath50 per sq .",
    "deg . or a probability of @xmath459% of finding such an object in the rcs-1 survey area . if the clusters are in fact less massive than our mass estimates suggest , then the probability of finding such a supercluster structure increases .",
    "we repeat our analysis using different mass thresholds for the component clusters until the surface density of such structures approaches that of one system per rcs-1 survey area . to do this",
    "requires the individual clusters to have masses of only @xmath51 m@xmath6 , i.e. , _ all three _ would have to be at least a factor of two less massive than our best estimates , which corresponds to a @xmath522@xmath38 deviation .",
    "the hubble volume simulation was performed with a value for the amplitude of fluctuations , @xmath53 , of 0.90 , whereas recent measurements such as the wmap 3-year results @xcite , find a lower value ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "lowering @xmath53 lowers the abundance of massive structures , particularly at higher redshift , making the chances of finding such a supercluster more unlikely in this cosmology .",
    "we have presented spectroscopic confirmation of three clusters , selected from a large optical survey and found to be x - ray luminous from _ chandra _ observations .",
    "two independent mass estimators for one cluster ( including a strong - lensing estimate from a newly confirmed z@xmath24 lyman break galaxy behind the cluster ) support the x - ray mass estimates .    the major axes of the three components of supercluster rcs2319 + 00 , as traced by the red - sequence significance @xcite contours , all point towards the nearest - neighbor cluster ( fig .  [ fig : sigmap ] ) .",
    "this alignment is also largely mirrored by the x - ray contours ( fig .  1 , @xcite ) .",
    "the tendency for neighboring clusters to point toward each other was first noticed by @xcite and is further independent evidence that these clusters are associated .",
    "in addition , this may give some clues as to the 3d alignment of the clusters haloes .",
    "one of the interpretations for the high incidence of strong - lensing clusters in rcs-1 is that the strongly - lensing systems may have their major axes directed along the line - of - sight @xcite .",
    "the alignment with the neighboring cluster , coupled with the small line - of - sight separation , might suggest that this is not the explanation in this case .",
    "detailed lens modeling will be required to try to constrain halo orientation and is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "the supercluster rcs2319 + 00 comprises three clusters , each massive in their own right ( @xmath55 m@xmath6 ) , which are likely to merge by low - redshift to form a system @xmath56 m@xmath6 .",
    "thus , this system gives us a unique opportunity to study one of the most massive clusters in the universe in the process of assembly .",
    "two other groups @xcite have reported finding superclusters at similar redshifts , but these represent somewhat different systems to that presented here .",
    "the @xcite supercluster ( cl1604 ) comprises at least four components @xcite spanning @xmath57 mpc by @xmath58 mpc ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "the clusters range in velocity dispersion from @xmath60 km s@xmath10to @xmath2900 km s@xmath10 . however , the x - ray temperature for the main cluster of cl1604 is only 2.5 kev @xcite , suggesting that at least this component is less massive than its velocity dispersion would imply , possibly due to the cluster being dynamically unrelaxed . the lower masses and larger separations suggest that cl1604 is less likely to merge into as massive a cluster as rcs2319 + 00 .",
    "the @xcite supercluster comprises five systems with approximate velocity dispersions @xmath61 km s@xmath10  ( @xmath62 m@xmath6 ) spread across 30 mpc .",
    "the lower masses of these systems is not surprising given the low space density of massive clusters and the 1 sq .",
    "size of their survey .",
    "the chances of finding a structure as massive as rcs2319 + 00 within the rcs-1 survey are @xmath63 with @xmath64 and less with a lower value , using the currently favored cosmological parameters .",
    "this may indicate that refinements to the current cosmological model are still to be made , but we are , of course , cautious about using the existence of a single system to make statements about cosmology .",
    "the order - of - magnitude greater area of rcs-2 @xcite will allow us to place stronger constraints on the abundance of such massive structures .",
    "a program of detailed wide - field spectroscopy to fully explore the 2319 + 00 structure is underway . in conjunction with our comprehensive on - going imacs spectroscopy of a core sample of rcs clusters ,",
    "selected to uniformly sample mass and redshift space , we will be able to probe the processes which drive galaxy evolution in clusters as a function of cluster mass .",
    "as an unusually massive cluster in the early stages of merging , and through comparison with lower - redshift @xmath5 m@xmath6 clusters , rcs2319 + 00 may give us a unique opportunity to identify processes which occur in massive clusters prior to their final assembly .    this paper",
