    "<S> we propose an effective scheme for the generation of intense coherent extreme ultraviolet light beams carrying orbital angular momentum ( oam ) . </S>",
    "<S> the light is produced by a high - gain harmonic - generation free - electron laser ( fel ) , seeded using a laser pulse with a transverse staircase - like phase pattern . during amplification , diffraction and mode selection </S>",
    "<S> drive the radiation profile towards a dominant oam mode at saturation . with a seed laser at 260 nm , </S>",
    "<S> gigawatt power levels are obtained at wavelengths approaching those of soft x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> compared to other proposed schemes to generate oam with fels , our approach is robust , easier to implement , and can be integrated into already existing fel facilities without extensive modifications of the machine layout .    [ [ section ] ]    modern generation free - electron lasers ( fels ) delivering high - brightness optical beams in the extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) @xcite and x - ray regions @xcite have become indispensable tools for probing structural and chemical properties of matter at femtosecond temporal and nanometer spatial resolutions @xcite . at present </S>",
    "<S> , transverse radiation profiles from fels working at saturation are limited to a fundamental gaussian - like mode with no azimuthal phase variation . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for fels based on self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) , where the amplification starts from electron shot - noise @xcite , as well as for seeded fels , such as those based on high - gain harmonic - generation ( hghg ) , where the amplification process is triggered by a coherent input signal @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> generation of high - order radiation modes , however , is a subject of strong interest , not only from the fundamental point of view but also in practical applications . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , helically phased light beams or optical vortices with a field dependence of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the azimuthal coordinate and @xmath2 an integer referred to as the topological charge , are currently among intensively studied topics in optics . </S>",
    "<S> these light beams , which carry orbital angular momentum ( oam ) @xcite that can be transferred to atoms , molecules , and nanostructures @xcite , have already been utilized at visible and infrared wavelengths in a wide variety of applications , ranging from micromanipulation @xcite , detection of spinning objects @xcite , microscopy @xcite , and optical data transmission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most promising applications of vortex beams at short wavelengths are in x - ray magnetic circular dichroism , where different oam states allow the separation of quadrupolar and dipolar transitions @xcite , photoionization experiments , where the dipolar selection rules are violated giving rise to new phenomena beyond the standard effect @xcite , and in resonant inelastic x - ray scattering , where vortex - beam - mediated coupling to vibrational degrees of freedom could provide important information on a wide range of molecular materials @xcite .    in the case of visible light , </S>",
    "<S> oam is commonly generated by sending the beam through a suitable optical element ( e.g. , a spiral phase plate ) . </S>",
    "<S> this technique has been used in the past to produce xuv or x - ray beams that carry oam @xcite . however , for high - brightness short - wavelength fel radiation , the damage threshold of optical elements placed into the beam path , and the difficulties in the fabrication of high quality optical surfaces , impose strong limitations on the use of this method . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , approaches using _ in situ _ optical vortex generation are preferred .    in the case of undulator radiation </S>",
    "<S> , pioneering theoretical work by sasaki and mcnulty showed that x - ray oam beams are produced as higher harmonics in a helical undulator @xcite , a principle recently demonstrated in an experiment @xcite . for fels , hemsing and </S>",
    "<S> coworkers proposed two clever approaches to generate vortex beams at short wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> the first one exploits the interaction of an electron beam ( e - beam ) with a seed laser in a helical undulator @xcite , while the second one is based on the echo - enabled harmonic generation ( eehg ) scheme @xcite , where two seed lasers and two magnetic chicanes are used to produce harmonic microbunching of an e - beam with a corkscrew distribution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a proof - of - principle experiment has recently been performed to demonstrate the first scheme using a single undulator section , generating optical vortices at 800 nm @xcite . in this approach , however , oam beams are produced at the fundamental frequency of the seed . </S>",
    "<S> reaching short wavelengths would therefore require a coherent xuv or x - ray input signal , which is not trivial to obtain . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the technique based on eehg uses a relatively complex setup , which has yet to be thoroughly tested in experiments .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we show that a relatively simple setup , based on the original hghg scheme @xcite , can be exploited in order to generate optical vortices at high harmonics of the seed laser , with wavelengths approaching those of soft x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> the method should , in principle , be straightforward to implement at existing seeded fel user facilities , without the need for major machine upgrades .    </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ scheme ] . the main difference with respect to the standard hghg setup </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is the use of an optical phase mask in order to create a transverse phase modulation in the seed laser profile . </S>",
    "<S> naively , the simplest way to produce an xuv / x - ray optical vortex with this setup would be to seed the fel directly with an oam beam , by using a spiral phase plate as the phase mask @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this approach fails at short wavelengths . to see why , </S>",
    "<S> let us look at the hghg process in more detail . during the interaction of the seed laser with the e - beam in the first undulator , called the modulator , the seed properties , including the transverse helical phase dependence , are imprinted onto the e - beam as an energy modulation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the longitudinally microbunched beam coming out of the dispersive section , which follows the modulator , also carries the oam phase signature . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial microbunching in the longitudinal direction contains significant harmonic components . </S>",
    "<S> however , the topological charge @xmath3 of higher harmonics is multiplied with the harmonic number @xmath4 @xcite ; i.e. , @xmath5 , where @xmath2 is the topological charge of the seed . </S>",
    "<S> this results in a high - order oam mode at the entrance of the second undulator , called the radiator , which is tuned to @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the seed laser wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> due to a lower coupling with the e - beam and stronger diffraction , this high - order oam mode is not amplified in the radiator @xcite , leading to a dominant fundamental ( non - oam ) mode at saturation .        </S>",
    "<S> the idea behind our approach is the following : instead of a helical transverse phase profile , a four quadrant staircase - like phase structure is imprinted onto an axially symmetric e - beam in the modulator . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting transverse distribution of electrons in phase can be represented by the following matrix : @xmath8 meaning simply that the electrons with the azimuthal coordinate between @xmath9 and @xmath10 have a relative phase of @xmath11 , the electrons with @xmath12 have a relative phase of @xmath13 and so on . </S>",
    "<S> following frequency up - conversion at the radiator entrance , the phase distribution is multiplied by @xmath4 , giving : @xmath14 which for odd @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an integer , becomes : @xmath17 for the case of odd @xmath16 , the elements in the main diagonal are interchanged , meaning that the transverse microbunching phase in the e - beam increases in the clockwise instead of anticlockwise direction .    </S>",
    "<S> the above equations show that the transverse microbunching structure is preserved for odd harmonics even after frequency up - conversion . </S>",
    "<S> the odd harmonics therefore carry the same staircase - like transverse phase pattern , which determines the spatial properties of the radiation at the radiator entrance . </S>",
    "<S> because this initial bunching distribution contains a strong helical component , the radiation profile evolves into a dominant @xmath18 oam mode at saturation . with an initial gaussian transverse seed profile with @xmath19 nm and e - beam parameters corresponding to modern seeded fels , optical beams carrying orbital angular momentum at xuv wavelengths can be generated .    </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phase_mask ] a ) provides details on the phase mask inserted into the beam path of the seed laser with an initial gaussian transverse intensity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the lens , placed just after the phase mask , performs a fourier transform of the transversely modulated electric field distribution at the focal plane , located in the middle of the modulator . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a transverse phase profile of the seed laser similar to the one represented by the matrix @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> due to diffraction , the staircase - like phase structure is maintained only near the focal plane of the seed . </S>",
    "<S> however , by choosing a relatively long focal distance ( 10 m ) , the integration of the seed laser electric field along the modulator , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phase_mask ] b ) , which is ( in first approximation ) proportional to the e - beam energy modulation , gives a phase profile which closely resembles that given by @xmath20 . despite the long focal distance , with seed laser powers around 1 gw or less , the bunching amplitude after the dispersive section is still sufficiently high to trigger the amplification of the @xmath18 oam mode in the radiator .        </S>",
    "<S> the construction of microbunching in the modulator and fel amplification in the radiator was studied in details using genesis @xcite . a 1.3 gev e - beam ( 0.1% energy spread ) with a transverse rms size of 150 @xmath21 m , normalized emittance @xmath22 @xmath21 m , and peak current of 1.5 ka was injected into a 1-m - long modulator tuned to the fundamental of the seed laser with @xmath19 nm and power of 1 gw . fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bunching ] a ) shows the transverse dependence of the amplitude and phase ( argument ) of the local microbunching factor defined as @xmath23}>$ ] , where @xmath24 is the ponderomotive phase of the @xmath25-th particle and the brackets denote the ensemble average over all the particles at a certain transverse position @xmath26 in the e - beam . </S>",
    "<S> the bunching distribution was evaluated after the beam passed through the dispersive section with @xmath27 @xmath21 m . </S>",
    "<S> the figure demonstrates that the transverse properties of the seed laser are efficiently transferred onto the e - beam . </S>",
    "<S> the microbunching distribution is maintained after frequency up - conversion when the e - beam enters the radiator , as shown in fig.[bunching ] b ) . due to the fact that the transverse microbunching phase profile is not perfectly flat inside the four quadrants , the phase structure also contains high frequency components . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the microbunching amplitude is relatively low in these areas , the generation of the oam mode is not affected , as demonstrated in the following .        fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ radiation_profile ] shows the evolution of the radiation profile in a 20 m long radiator , tuned to the 7th harmonic of the seed laser , i.e. @xmath28 nm . the initial field ( @xmath29 m ) has a phase and intensity structure determined by the microbunching distribution after frequency up - conversion ( _ cf . </S>",
    "<S> _ fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ bunching ] b ) ) , clearly showing the four - quadrant staircase - like phase dependence . since the initial radiation profile is not a guided fel radiation mode with a self - similar intensity distribution , it will evolve due to diffraction and amplification in the radiator . initially , at the radiator entrance </S>",
    "<S> , the bunching construction can be considered as rigid @xcite , therefore the evolution of the radiation profile is mainly governed by diffraction and linear amplification of the field . </S>",
    "<S> this is exemplified in the middle panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ radiation_profile ] where the radiation profile has evolved from a four - quadrant / four - sources - like distribution to a profile highly resembling a ring - like intensity pattern with a helical phase dependence . as the e - beam enters the second half of the radiator , the fel starts operating in the high - gain regime . </S>",
    "<S> here , the transverse mode selection process @xcite favors radiation profiles of lower modes , such as the fundamental gaussian - like and the @xmath18 oam modes . </S>",
    "<S> generally , in the high - gain regime and for a sufficiently long radiator , only the mode with the highest growth rate ( gaussian - like non oam mode ) will remain at saturation . </S>",
    "<S> however , using the seeding scheme described above , diffraction in the first part of the radiator gives rise to a strong @xmath18 mode at the beginning of the exponential growth regime . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath18 oam mode reaches saturation well before the fundamental mode . </S>",
    "<S> as other higher modes are filtered out due to lower growth rates , the amplification process drives the radiation profile towards a dominant guided oam mode with unit topological charge at saturation , as shown in the right panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ radiation_profile ] .        </S>",
    "<S> the above conclusions are supported by fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ power ] where we plot the power , modulus of the longitudinal bunching factor for the fundamental mode @xmath30 , and the helical bunching factors for the two higher ( oam ) modes with @xmath31 , defined as @xmath32 @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> the brackets denote the ensemble average over all the particles in the e - beam . </S>",
    "<S> the figures show the evolution of the radiation from the initial quadratic regime , where the bunching factors remain almost constant , into the high - gain regime where the modes are amplified . throughout the amplification process </S>",
    "<S> , the bunching at the fundamental and @xmath33 modes remains below @xmath34% of the bunching factor @xmath35 corresponding to the @xmath18 mode . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that with our seeding scheme a strong @xmath18 component is excited at the radiator entrance . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity as well as @xmath35 attain maximum values at the radiator exit as the @xmath18 oam mode reaches saturation at a gigawatt power level .        figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ radiation_profile ] and [ power ] demonstrate the power and robustness of our approach . by simply using an optical phase mask in order to inject an e - beam with a strong helical bunching component into the radiator , an oam mode with gigawatt power levels </S>",
    "<S> is obtained at saturation . </S>",
    "<S> even though the seed laser does not imprint a pure @xmath18 oam profile onto the e - beam , this mode emerges as the dominant one automatically at saturation due to diffraction and mode selection in the radiator .    </S>",
    "<S> our method can be readily extended to higher harmonics . for shorter wavelengths , the radiator length at which a pure @xmath18 oam mode is obtained scales with the rayleigh range , which is proportional to @xmath36 , assuming a constant beam size of the seed laser . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , by adjusting the modulator length , seed waist and power , optical vortices at wavelengths approaching those of soft x - rays can be generated efficiently with e - beam parameters of modern seeded fels .    </S>",
    "<S> the above results were obtained for the case of a planar radiator . </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed simulations using a helical radiator where , due to a shorter gain length , we could relax the condition on the electron peak current required to reach saturation ( 1 ka instead of 1.5 ka ) . at this point </S>",
    "<S> we would like to stress that using a movable phase mask and a variable polarizing undulator @xcite our method allows to independently control oam and spin , thereby enabling complete control over the total angular momentum carried by an fel - light beam .    </S>",
    "<S> compared to other approaches where , e.g. a helical modulator is used to generate oam beams @xcite , our technique is much more general . by modifying the phase mask , </S>",
    "<S> the seed laser can be manipulated in order to change the transverse properties of the fel light at saturation . with a two - quadrant phase mask and a phase jump of @xmath37 , a fel profile close to a tem@xmath38 </S>",
    "<S> is obtained at high harmonics of the seed laser ( not shown ) . </S>",
    "<S> our technique based on an optical phase mask therefore opens up new opportunities that will allow to manipulate the spatio - temporal properties of modern and future light sources delivering high photon fluxes at xuv and soft x - rays wavelengths .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose to use our scheme in high - order harmonic generation ( hhg ) in gases . with our setup </S>",
    "<S> the generation of well - defined vortex beams with unit topological charge could be extended into the so - called linear propagation regime @xcite , where the propagation instabilities which lead to formation of low - order vortices @xcite are not important . even though the transverse mode selection process is absent in hhg </S>",
    "<S> , the propagation effects alone could result in a well - defined dominant @xmath18 oam mode in far field . </S>",
    "<S> extensive simulations are currently underway to corroborate our hypothesis . </S>"
