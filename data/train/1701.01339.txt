    "understanding the nature of the dark matter ( dm ) component of the universe constitutes a key issue in fundamental physics and in cosmology . during the last two decades ,",
    "the formation and the growth of cosmic structures has progressively adopted the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm as a baseline  @xcite .",
    "this envisages dm particles to be characterized by thermal velocities small enough to produce negligible free streaming on the scales relevant to structure formation .",
    "typically , this corresponds either to assuming dm particles to be massive ( @xmath6  gev ) or to be constituted by condensates of light axions ( with mass @xmath7  ev ) .",
    "basic motivations for such a scenario are its simple properties ( the corresponding power spectrum has a self - similar power law behavior in the whole range of mass scales involved in galaxy formation ) and the fact that particles with mass and cross sections characteristic of the weak scales ( weakly interacting massive particles , wimps , with masses @xmath8  gev ) produce approximately the correct abundance of dm when they freeze - out of equilibrium in the early universe . on the other hand",
    ", extensive studies of structure formation showed that the cdm model provides an excellent baseline to explain the properties of large - scale structures and of galaxies on a huge range of mass scales ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "however , as of now , both direct  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and indirect  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , while experiments aimed to detect axions as dm components have produced no evidence in the explored portion of the parameter space  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the structure formation side",
    ", several critical issues are affecting the cdm scenario at the mass scales of dwarf galaxies ( @xmath12 @xmath13 ) .",
    "these are all connected to the excess of power in the cdm power spectrum at such scales compared to a variety of observations , and include : the excess dm density of the inner regions of dwarf galaxies compared to the observed cored profiles  ( see * ? ? ? * ) ,",
    "the over - abundance of faint dwarfs around our galaxy and in the local group  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as in the field  @xcite , the excess of massive satellite dm halos with virial velocities @xmath14 km / s relative to the number of observed bright dwarf galaxies  @xcite , and  most of all  the over - prediction of the abundance of field dwarfs with @xmath15 4060  km / s  @xcite .    while a refined treatment of baryonic effects entering galaxy formation ( in particular feedback from supernovae ) has been proposed to solve or at least alleviate the above problems ( see , e.g. , governato et al",
    "2012 , 2015 ; di cintio et al . 2014 ) , the combination of astrophysical issues with the lack of direct or indirect detection of candidate particles has stimulated the interest toward different dm scenarios , characterized by power spectra with suppressed amplitude at small mass scales ( @xmath16 @xmath13 ) with respect to the cdm case .",
    "in fact , several groups have started to investigate galaxy formation in a number of alternative models , such as self - interacting dm  @xcite , decaying dm  @xcite , late - forming dm  @xcite , atomic dm  @xcite , and dm interacting with dark radiation  @xcite .    in this framework",
    ", a specific focus has been given to warm dark matter ( wdm ) scenarios , which assume dm to be composed by particles with masses @xmath17 in the  kev range .",
    "their larger thermal velocities ( corresponding to larger free - streaming lengths ) suppress structure formation at scales @xmath18@xmath19 @xmath13 , depending on the exact value of @xmath17 ( since a thermalized species has no memory of the details of its production ) .",
    "while wdm candidates may result from the freeze - out of particles initially in thermal equilibrium in the early universe  ( like , e.g. , gravitinos , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , a similar suppression at these scales can be obtained by a variety of models featuring particles in the  kev mass range with _ non - thermal _ spectra , like sterile neutrinos .",
    "note that , in the case of non - thermal spectra , the production mechanism is essential in determining the suppression of the power spectra with respect to cdm .",
    "the shape of the power spectra are  although even that only qualitatively  somewhat similar to thermal wdm cases only for specific regions of the parameter space of the assumed production model , since a non - thermal spectrum can not be associated with a temperature straightforwardly .",
    "thus , to provide accurate limits to the mass of a non - thermal candidate , a detailed exploration of the parameter space of the selected models has to be performed . in this work , we tackle this task focusing on models of  kev sterile neutrinos , which received a particular interest in the literature in recent years  @xcite .",
    "this is due to both solid fundamental physics motivations ( right - handed neutrinos constitute a natural extension of the standard model to provide mass terms for active neutrinos , see  @xcite and to the fact that such particles constitute the simplest candidates  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for a dark matter interpretation of the potential x - ray line in stacked observations of galaxy clusters and in the perseus cluster  @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the presence of a tiny admixtures @xmath2 with the active neutrinos , the decay of sterile neutrinos can result into photon emission at energies close to @xmath20 .",
    "the non - detection of such a line in galaxies , dwarf galaxies , or the milky way  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for an extended discussion ) yields effective _ upper _ limits on the mass of sterile neutrinos for each value of the mixing angle in the range @xmath21  @xcite , which rule out sterile neutrino models based on the non - resonant production mechanism by dodelson - widrow  @xcite .",
    "however , general _ lower _ mass bounds ( arising from phase space density of nearby dwarf galaxies ) are rather loose , yielding a model - independent limit @xmath22  kev  @xcite , and leave a major portion of the parameter space largely unconstrained , in scenarios in which sterile neutrinos are resonantly produced ( rp  models ) in the presence of a lepton asymmetry @xmath23 in the background medium  ( as proposed by * ? ? ?",
    "they can , however , be significantly tightened when the information available from the production mechanism is taken into account  @xcite , thereby strongly pushing such scenarios .",
    "other settings , where sterile neutrinos are produced by decays of , e.g. , scalar particles  , are largely unconstrained by present x - ray observations , since they could in principle operate even without active - sterile mixing .",
    "note that the corresponding parent in such scalar decay ( sd ) models must themselves be coupled to the standard model , typically via the higgs sector .",
    "thus , the key free parameters in such settings are the higgs portal coupling and the yukawa coupling between the scalar and the sterile neutrinos . for more complicated spectra",
    ", they can even look entirely different from thermal cases and exhibit qualitatively new features such as more than one momentum scale , long tales , or similar .",
    "another proposed solution to the small - scale problems in galaxy formation is based on bose condensates of ultra - light ( pseudo ) scalar field dm with mass @xmath24  ev  @xcite , which may be in the form of axions arising in string theory  @xcite or other extensions of the standard model of particle physics  ( see * ? ? ? * for a historic review ) . in these settings ,",
    "dm particles can be described by a single coherent wave function with a single free parameter @xmath25 , the dm particle mass .",
    "the quantum pressure arising from the de broglie wavelength produces a steep suppression of the transfer function below the corresponding jeans length  @xcite , making this scenario a viable alternative solution to the small - scale problems in galaxy formations  ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "in fact , the soliton solution allows for cored inner density profiles in dwarf galaxies , while the substructures in dm halos , arising from fine - scale , large - amplitude cellular interference , would yield a suppressed abundance of satellite compared to the cdm case  @xcite .",
    "for such models , often referred to as `` fuzzy '' dm , the parameter space corresponding to the different possible power spectra is rather simple , since it depends only on the particle mass @xmath25 .",
    "this is expected to be @xmath26  ev  ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to resolve the cusp - core problem ( without recourse to baryon feedback , or other astrophysical effects ) , but values up to @xmath27  ev have been considered in previous works  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the abundance of low - mass cosmic structures provides an important key to either restrict the range of allowed sterile neutrino production models , or rule out presently allowed dm scenarios . in the case of thermal relic wdm particles , the one - to - one correspondence between the wdm particle mass and the suppression in the power spectrum at small scales has allowed to derive limits on @xmath17 by comparing the predictions from @xmath28-body wdm simulations or semi - analytic models with the abundance of observed ultra - faint satellites . on this basis ,",

    "note that , however , such a method is appreciably sensitive to the assumed completeness corrections  ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to the treatment of sub - halo stripping , and to the assumed values for the dm mass of the host halo and of the satellites . at higher redshifts , @xmath0 ,",

    "2016 ) , deriving a consistency of such a model with the observed galaxy abundances for the whole particle mass range , @xmath36 .",
    "since these approaches are based on the comparison between the observed luminosity functions and the predicted mass function of dm halos in different wdm models , the delicate issue in these methods is their dependence on the physics of baryons , determining the mass - to - light ratio of faint galaxies .",
    "although to a lesser extent , uncertainties in the baryonic physics also affect  @xcite the tighter constraints achieved so far @xmath37  kev for wdm thermal relics , derived by comparing small scale structure in the lyman-@xmath38 forest of high- resolution ( @xmath39 ) quasar spectra with hydrodynamical @xmath28-body simulations ( @xcite ; for a generalization of this method to sterile neutrinos models , see schneider ( 2016 ) .    to derive robust limits on alternative dm scenarios , it is crucial to bypass the uncertainties related to the physics of baryons involved in galaxy formation , in order to get rid of the degeneracies between the effect of baryons and of the dm power spectrum in suppressing the number of observed low - mass structures . to this aim ,",
    "@xcite have exploited the downturn of the halo mass distribution @xmath40 in models with suppressed power spectra , which yields a maximum number density @xmath41 of dm halos in the cumulative mass distribution that in turn depends on the adopted dm model .",
    "since luminous galaxies can not outnumber dm halos , an observed galaxy density @xmath42 would rule out the adopted dm model independently of the baryonic processes determining the luminous properties of galaxies .",
    "such a method , first applied to lensed galaxies at @xmath43 in  @xcite and to galaxies at @xmath44 in the hubble deep field in  @xcite , has acquired an increased potential with the first results of the hubble frontier field ( hff ) programme . by exploiting the magnification power of gravitational lensing produced by foreground clusters",
    ", hff has enabled the detection of galaxies fainter than the detection limit of the hubble deep field at @xmath45  , to reach unprecedented faint magnitudes @xmath46 in the measurement of the luminosity function of galaxies at @xmath47 in  @xcite .",
    "the large number density @xmath48 ( at 2-@xmath5 confidence level ) corresponding to the observed luminosity function allowed us to set a robust lower limit @xmath49  kev ( at 2-@xmath5 ) to the mass of thermal relic wdm particles .",
    "this constitutes the tightest constraint derived so far on thermal wdm candidates independent of the baryon physics involved in galaxy formation .",
    "given the potential and the robustness of this method , it is only natural to apply it to different sterile neutrino production models , which offer a natural framework for physically motivated dm candidates as discussed above . in this paper , by requiring the maximum number density attained in a given dm model to be larger than the observed hff value , we will provide unprecedented constraints on the parameter space for different sterile neutrino production mechanisms .",
    "in particular , the combinations @xmath50 defining the different rp models will be explored to significantly restrict the allowed regions in combination with existing bounds , while for sd models we will set limits on the different combinations of free parameters , i.e. , the scalar mass , the higgs portal coupling , and the yukawa coupling between the scalar and the sterile neutrino .",
    "we shall then turn to apply the method to the fuzzy dm scenario to provide lower limits on the ultra - light pseudo - axion mass @xmath25 which will turn out to rule out this class of models .",

    "[ sec : method ] we provide a description of the method . in sect .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] is devoted to our conclusions .",
    "to derive constraints on the parameter space of sterile neutrino ( rp and sd ) dm models and of the fuzzy dm models , we compute the maximum number density of dm halos @xmath51 expected at redshift @xmath47 for each point of the parameter space , and compare it to the observed number density @xmath52 of galaxies at the same redshift obtained from the galaxy luminosity function measured by @xcite . since observed galaxies can not outnumber their host dm halos , the condition @xmath53 determines the set of parameters admitted for each dm model .",
    "the method is based on the drop of the differential halo mass function @xmath54 at small masses in models where the power spectrum is strongly suppressed with respect to cdm at masses @xmath55 . as a consequence ,",
    "the corresponding cumulative halo mass function @xmath56 saturates to a maximum value @xmath51 when the integral is extended down to progressively smaller values of @xmath57 .",
    "this provides a maximum value for the number density of dm halos regardless of the underlying mass - luminosity relation , and  hence  _ completely independent of the baryon physics entering galaxy formation_.    in the following , we describe our computation of the observed number density @xmath52 and or the maximum predicted number density @xmath51 , in turn .      for the observed number density @xmath52",
    ", we take the value derived integrating the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath47 down to the faintest bin @xmath58  @xcite .",

    "10 of  @xcite . from this",
    "we have derived the observed cumulative number density @xmath60 ( and its confidence levels ) through a monte carlo procedure @xcite .",
    "we extracted random values @xmath61 of the luminosity function in each magnitude bin according to a gaussian distribution with variance given by the error bar in @xcite .",
    "thus , for each simulation we produced a new realization of the luminosity function at @xmath47 . from this , a cumulative number density @xmath62 has been derived by summing up the values of @xmath61 in all the observed magnitude bins in the range @xmath63 .",
    "we carried out @xmath64 simulations to compute the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the cumulative number density @xmath62 .",

    "we have checked that the median value of the differential luminosity function @xmath66 obtained from our simulations is consistent ( within 3% ) with the best fit value of the luminosity function obtained by @xcite .",
    "note that such a procedure assumes that each magnitude bin is uncorrelated with the adjacent ones ( as indeed done in both the livermore 2016 and the bouwens 2016 analysis ) . in case of correlated bins larger",
    "errorbars are expected for blank field observations ( see the discussion in castellano et al .",
    "2010 ) , but a quantitative estimate of such an effect for measurements involving lensing magnification is lacking ; this would constitute an interesting improvement over the present treatment .",
    "note that the measurements of the luminosity functions derived by @xcite are particulary delicate at the faint end where large lensing magnifications are involved .",
    "indeed , bouwens et al .",
    "( 2016 ) have adopted a different estimate of the impact of lensing magnifiction finding not only a lower median value for the number density of galaxies at @xmath67 compared to @xcite , but also larger errorbars .",

    "we summarize the key points of the computation and we refer to the above papers for details .",

    "then , the differential halo mass function ( per unit @xmath84 ) based on the extended press & schechter approach  @xcite reads @xmath85 here , @xmath86 depends on the linearly extrapolated density for collapse in the spherical model , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the growth factor of dm perturbations .",
    "we conservatively assume a spherical collapse model , for which @xmath89 . assuming an ellipsoidal collapse model would yield a lower halo mass function at the low - mass end and  hence  even tighter constraints on the dm particle mass .    for sterile neutrino dm , yielding power spectra suppressed at small scales compared to cdm , the resulting differential mass functions ,",

    "are characterized by a maximum value at masses close to the `` half - mode '' mass  @xcite , the mass scale at which the spectrum is suppressed by 1/2 compared to cdm .",
    "this function depends strongly on the sterile neutrino mass ; for rp models it also depends on the lepton asymmetry assumed and , hence , on the resulting mixing angle @xmath90 ; typical power spectra in such models yield half - mode masses ranging from @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "correspondingly , the cumulative mass functions saturate to a maximum value @xmath93 , defining the maximum number density of dm halos associated to the considered power spectrum .",
    "a similar behavior characterizes the halo mass functions in the fuzzy dm case .",

    ", we briefly recall the properties of the parameter space we explore for the different dm models we consider .",
    "the minimal setup for sterile neutrino dm is the production via mixing with one or several active neutrino flavors .",
    "active neutrinos are weakly interacting and are therefore in thermal equilibrium with other standard model particles in the early universe ( i.e.  at temperatures above the mev range ) . during that epoch",
    ", the sterile neutrino abundance builds up gradually via occasional oscillations from the active to the sterile sector . depending on mixing angle and particle mass , this",
    "_ freeze - in _ production can lead to the right amount of sterile neutrino dm  @xcite and is usually referred to as dodelson - widrow ( dw ) mechanism or _ non - resonant _ production .",
    "recent investigations based on combined limits from structure formation and x - ray observations have ruled out this production mechanism as the dominant contributor to the dm sector  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been noticed early on that the active - sterile oscillation may be enhanced by a resonance  @xcite , provided there exists a significant lepton asymmetry @xmath23 in the early universe .",
    "such a resonance allows for significantly smaller mixing angles @xmath90 , relaxing the tight limits from x - ray observations .",
    "furthermore , the resulting particle momentum distributions may be colder and , therefore , in better agreement with structure formation  @xcite .",
    "the shi & fuller ( sf ) or _ resonant _ production mechanism of sterile neutrino dm  @xcite , first mentioned in @xcite , also plays an important part in the framework of the _ neutrino minimal standard model _ ( @xmath99msm ) , which attempts to simultaneously solve the problems of dm , non - zero neutrino masses , and baryon asymmetry by solely adding three additional sterile neutrino flavors to the standard model  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at the cost of introducing a considerable fine tuning to produce a suitable lepton asymmetry .",
    "note that in the @xmath99msm , there is an upper limit for the allowed lepton asymmetry ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hence , there is a lower limit on the mixing angle even in the resonant case if the production mechanism is to explain the total dm abundance .    since , for any given sterile neutrino mass , the mixing angle is related to the adopted lepton asymmetry @xmath23 , in this work we describe the parameter space of rp sterile neutrino models in terms of combinations of sterile neutrino masses @xmath1 and mixing amplitudes @xmath100 .",
    "each one of such combinations corresponds to a different momentum distribution , which strongly differs from a generic fermi - dirac form  @xcite . in many cases such non - thermal momentum distributions",
    "are characterized by colder mean particle momenta and by a larger range of different momenta compared to the case of non - resonant production . in terms of structure formation , this may result in density perturbations which are more gradually suppressed and survive down to smaller scales .",
    "this is , however , only true for certain parts of the parameter space , while other parts show similar ( or even stronger ) suppression of matter perturbations compared to the case of non - resonant sterile neutrino dm ( for more details see schneider 2016 ) .    in this work",
    "the sterile neutrino momentum distributions of rp are computed with the public code _ sterile - dm _ of  @xcite , which is an extension of earlier works @xcite .",
    "the computation is based on the boltzmann equation and includes detailed calculations of the lepton asymmetry around the quark - hadron transition .",
    "independent calculations by @xcite give similar results . to obtain the power spectra , we use the publicly available boltzmann solver _ class _  @xcite .",
    "production from scalar decay is described by a generic model that invokes one real scalar singlet @xmath101 and ( at least ) one sterile neutrino @xmath28 beyond the standard model .",
    "the scalar singlet couples to the sm higgs doublet @xmath102 via a _ higgs portal _ , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is a dimensionless coupling .",
    "the interaction between the scalar and the sterile neutrino is encoded in @xmath105 where @xmath106 is a yukawa - type coupling . in the most general case ,",
    "the complete model lagrangian should contain terms for the mixing between active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "we will , however , neglect these terms , since non - resonant active - sterile mixing can not contribute significantly to the production of sterile neutrinos when x - ray limits and limits of structure formation are taken into account  @xcite .",
    "note that the assumption of having only one right - handed neutrino is not very restrictive , since most statements can easily be generalised to the case of several right handed states  @xcite .",
    "the free parameters of the scalar decay model are the following :    1 .   the higgs portal coupling @xmath104 , which determines the production rate and the kinematics of the scalar from the sm degrees of freedom of the higgs doublet .",
    "the yukawa coupling @xmath106 , which enters into the decay rate of the scalar and hence controls how fast the scalar decays into sterile neutrinos .",
    "3 .   the mass of the scalar singlet , @xmath107 , which determines which channels contribute to the production of scalars and thereby finally to the abundance of sterile neutrinos . if @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the mass of the physical higgs boson , thermal higgses can directly decay into scalars which increases the production drastically compared to those cases where @xmath101 can only be produced from pairwise annihilation of sm degrees of freedom . for a detailed discussion of the individual regimes , see sect . 2 of  @xcite .",
    "the mass of the sterile neutrino , denoted @xmath110 .",
    "it will strongly influence the effects on cosmological structure formation .",
    "nonetheless we want to stress again that the scalar decay mechanism is highly non - thermal and that no premature conclusion on the sterile neutrino being `` too hot '' or `` quasi - cold '' should be made .    in this work , we will treat @xmath104 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 as free parameters . for each triple of @xmath111 , we fix the mass of the sterile neutrino by requiring it to reproduce the observed relic dm abundance .",
    "we use the best - fit values published by the planck collaboration  @xcite .",
    "we have scanned the remaining three - dimensional parameter space by first solving the homogeneous and isotropic boltzmann equation governing the production of sterile neutrinos in the early universe  @xcite .",
    "the resulting momentum distribution functions and the value of @xmath110 inferred from the relic abundance constraint then served as an input to compute the linear power spectra , again using the _ class _ code  @xcite .",
    "let us very briefly discuss the interplay between the higgs portal and the yukawa coupling , in order to make the results presented later on easier to digest : for small higgs portal couplings , the scalar itself is produced by freeze - in and is always strongly suppressed compared to its would - be equilibrium abundance .",
    "physically , this means that backreactions of scalars into sm particles can be neglected completely . in this case , the relic abundance of sterile neutrinos ( and hence the mass @xmath110 ) are independent of the yukawa coupling @xmath106 for a fixed pair @xmath112 .",
    "nonetheless , the yukawa coupling controls the production time of the sterile neutrinos , which is one of the key factors for structure formation .",
    "when @xmath104 is large enough to equilibrate the scalars , they will be subject to the well - known dynamics of freeze - out . in this regime",
    ", sterile neutrinos can be produced from scalars in equilibrium and from those decaying after freeze - out .",
    "accordingly , the number density of steriles and thereby their mass @xmath110 can strongly depend on @xmath106 even for fixed @xmath112 .",

    "these values are one order of magnitude larger than those required to yield core sizes of dwarf galaxies large enough to match the observations  @xcite .",

    "thus , on the observational side , the first step to improve the results presented in this paper consists in a deeper understanding of the systematics associated with the lensing observations of faint , high - redshift galaxies . as for the lensing magnification , with typical values @xmath181 and as large as @xmath182 for the faintest galaxies , the analysis in @xcite shows that large differences are found in the magnification estimates of individual galaxies when different lensing models are assumed .",
    "this is in agreement with the recent analysis by @xcite , who compared the performances of several lensing models on artificial images mimicking the depth and resolution of hff data .",
    "they find that the largest uncertainties in the lens models are found near sub - structures and around the cluster critical lines , concluding that uncertainties in the magnification estimate are growing with the magnification value itself ( 30% of magnification uncertainties at @xmath183 ) .",
    "however , while the magnification of each individual galaxy could be subject to a large variance , the aggregated information of the abundance of high - z galaxies is less subject to such systematics .",
    "the analysis in @xcite shows that the different lensing models introduce minimal changes in the best - fit luminosity functions , even at the faintest absolute magnitudes @xmath46 analyzed at @xmath184 , with a systematic uncertainty on the slope @xmath38 of the luminosity functions at @xmath185 below 2% .",
    "although such an uncertainty would not change appreciably the results presented in this work , the proper procedure to be adopted in deriving the variance in the luminosity function due to the magnification is still matter of debate ( see * ? ? ?",

    "while @xcite find that the typical values of @xmath186 at @xmath47 is of the order of @xmath189  pc for @xmath190 , larger values are usually obtained in the literature : extrapolating the size distribution obtained by @xcite for @xmath191 galaxies at @xmath184 to fainter magnitudes ( assuming a size - luminosity relation of @xmath192 * ? ? ?",

    "thus , while the completeness correction adopted by @xcite is consistent with most of the extrapolations in the literature , assessing the actual size distribution of ultra - faint galaxies at @xmath0 would constitute an important improvement for a precise determination of the number density of such galaxies , so as to lower this source of systematics below the present value @xmath197 . in the future we plan to analyze the impact of the size - luminosity relation on the hff luminosity function based on detailed simulations , using the same technique adopted in @xcite to comply with the delicate issues ( i.e. , distortions due to the strong lensing amplification ) involved in the measurement of sizes for such faint , noisy galaxies .    thus , although the measurement by @xcite constitutes a state - of - the - art achievement ,",
    "the analysis of the hff observations is open to several advancements .",
    "this is true not only for the most magnified objects ( as discussed above ) , but also for those moderate magnifications ( @xmath198 ) , for which the largest source of uncertainty is constituted by the accuracy of photometric redshifts . in this respect",
