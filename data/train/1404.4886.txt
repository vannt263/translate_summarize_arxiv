    "the study of collective motion in systems consisting of a large number of agents , such as bird flocks , fish schools , suspensions of active swimmers ( bacteria , sperm cells ) , etc has triggered an intense literature in the recent years .",
    "we refer to @xcite for recent reviews on the subject .",
    "many of such studies rely on a particle model or individual based model ( ibm ) that describes the motion of each individual separately ( see e.g in @xcite ) .    in this work",
    ", we aim to describe dense suspensions of elongated self - propelled particles in a fluid , such as sperm . in such dense suspensions ,",
    "steric repulsion is an essential ingredient of the dynamics .",
    "a large part of the literature is concerned with dilute suspensions @xcite . in these approaches , the stokes equation for the fluid",
    "is coupled to the orientational distribution function of the self - propelled particles .",
    "however , these approaches are of `` mean - field type '' i.e. assume that particle interactions are mediated by the fluid through some kinds of averages . these approaches do not deal easily with short - range interactions such as steric repulsion or interactions mediated by lubrication forces .",
    "additionally , these models assume a rather simple geometry of the swimmers , which are reduced to a force dipole , while the true geometry and motion of an actual swimmer , like a sperm cell , is considerably more complex .    in a recent work @xcite ,",
    "peruani et al showed that , for dense systems of elongated self - propelled particles , steric interaction results in alignment . relying on this work , and owing to the fact that the description of swimmer interactions from first physical principles is by far too complex",
    ", we choose to replace the fluid - mediated interaction by a simple alignment interaction of vicsek type @xcite .",
    "in the vicsek model , the agents move with constant speed and attempt to align with their neighbors up to some noise .",
    "many aspects of the vicsek model have been studied , such as phase transitions @xcite , numerical simulations @xcite , derivation of macroscopic models @xcite .",
    "the alignment interaction acting alone may trigger the formation of high particle concentrations .",
    "however , in dense suspensions , volume exclusion prevent such high densities to occur .",
    "when distances between particles become too small , repulsive forces are generated by the fluid or by the direct reaction of the bodies one to each other .",
    "these forces contribute to repel the particles and to prevent further contacts . to model this behavior",
    ", we must add a repulsive force to the vicsek alignment model .",
    "inspired by @xcite we consider the possibility that the particle orientations ( i.e the directions of the self - propulsion force ) and the particle velocities may be different .",
    "indeed , steric interaction may push the particles in a direction different from that of their self - propulsion force .",
    "we consider an overdamped regime in which the velocity is proportional to the force through a mobility coefficient .",
    "the overdamped limit is justified by the fact that the background fluid is viscous and thus the forces due to friction are very large compared to those due to motion .",
    "indeed , for micro size particles , the reynolds number is very small ( @xmath1 ) and thus the effect of inertia can be neglected .",
    "finally , differently from @xcite we consider an additional term describing the relaxation of the particle orientation towards the direction of the particle velocity .",
    "we also take into account a brownian noise in the orientation dynamics of the particles .",
    "this noise may take into account the fluid turbulence for instance .",
    "therefore , the particle dynamics results from an interplay between relaxation towards the mean orientation of the surrounding particles , relaxation towards the direction of the velocity vector and brownian noise . from now on we refer to the above described model as the vicsek model with repulsion .    starting from the above described microscopic dynamical system we successively derive mean - field equations and hydrodynamic equations .",
    "mean field equations are valid when the number of particles is large and describe the evolution of the one - particle distribution , i.e. the probability for a particle to have a given orientation and position at a given instant of time .",
    "expressing that the spatio - temporal scales of interest are large compared to the agents scales leads to a singular perturbation problem in the kinetic equation . taking the hydrodynamic limit , ( i.e. the limit of the singular perturbation parameter to zero ) leads to the hydrodynamic model .",
    "hydrodynamic models are particularly well - suited to systems consisting of a large number of agents and to the observation of the system s large scale structures .",
    "indeed , the computational cost of ibm increases dramatically with the number of agents , while that of hydrodynamic models is independent of it . with ibm ,",
    "it is also sometimes quite cumbersome to access observables such as order parameters , while these quantities are usually directly encoded into the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the derivation of hydrodynamic models has been intensely studied by many authors .",
    "many of these models are based on phenomenological considerations @xcite or derived from moment approaches and ad - hoc closure relations @xcite .",
    "the first mathematical derivation of a hydrodynamic system for the vicsek model has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "we refer to this model to as the self - organized hydrodynamic ( soh ) model .",
    "one of the main contributions of @xcite is the concept of `` generalized collision invariants '' ( gci ) which permits the derivation of macroscopic equations for a particle system in spite of its lack of momentum conservation .",
    "the soh model has been further refined in @xcite .",
    "performing the hydrodynamic limit in the kinetic equations associated to the vicsek model with repulsion leads to the so - called `` self - organized hydrodynamics with repulsion '' ( sohr ) system .",
    "the sohr model consists of a continuity equation for the density @xmath2 and an evolution equation for the average orientation @xmath3 where @xmath4 indicates the spatial dimension .",
    "more precisely , the model reads @xmath5 where @xmath6 the coefficients @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are associated to the microscopic dynamics and will be defined later on .",
    "the symbol @xmath15 stands for the projection matrix @xmath16 of @xmath17 on the hyperplane @xmath18 .",
    "the sohr model is similar to the soh model obtained in @xcite , but with several additional terms which are consequences of the repulsive force at the particle level .",
    "the repulsive force intensity is characterized by the parameter @xmath19 . in the case",
    "@xmath20 , the sohr system is reduced to the soh one .",
    "we first briefly describe the original soh model . inserting ( [ macro4_intro ] ) , ( [ macro5_intro ] ) with @xmath20 into ( [ macro1_intro ] ) , ( [ macro2_intro ] )",
    "leads to @xmath21 together with ( [ macro3_intro ] ) .",
    "this model shares similarities with the isothermal compressible navier - stokes ( ns ) equations .",
    "both models consist of a non linear hyperbolic part supplemented by a diffusion term .",
    "( [ macro6_intro ] ) expresses conservation of mass , while eq .",
    "( [ macro7_intro ] ) is an equation for the mean orientation of the particles .",
    "it is not conservative , contrary to the corresponding momentum conservation equation in ns .",
    "the two equations are supplemented by the geometric constraint ( [ macro3_intro ] ) .",
    "this constraint is satisfied at all times , as soon as it is satisfied initially .",
    "the preservation of this property is guaranteed by the projection operator @xmath22 .",
    "a second important difference between the soh model and ns equations is that the convection velocities for the density and the orientation , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively are different while for ns they are equal . that @xmath25 is a consequence of the lack of galilean invariance of the model ( there is a preferred frame , which is that of the fluid ) .",
    "the main consequence is that the propagation of sound waves is anisotropic for this type of fluids @xcite .",
    "the first main difference between the soh and the sohr system is the presence of the terms @xmath26 in the expressions of the velocities @xmath27 and @xmath28 . inserting this term in the density eq .",
    "( [ macro1_intro ] ) results in a diffusion - like term @xmath29 which avoids the formation of high particle concentrations .",
    "this term shows similarities with the non - linear diffusion term in porous media models .",
    "similarly , inserting the term @xmath26 in the orientation eq .",
    "( [ macro2_intro ] ) results in a convection term in the direction of the gradient of the density .",
    "its effect is to force particles to change direction and move towards regions of lower concentration .",
    "the second main difference is the replacement of the linear ( with respect to @xmath2 ) pressure term @xmath30 by a nonlinear pressure @xmath31 in the orientation eq .",
    "( [ macro2_intro ] ) .",
    "the nonlinear part of the pressure enhances the effects of the repulsion forces when concentrations become high .    to further establish the validity of the sohr model ( [ macro1_intro])-([macro5_intro ] )",
    ", we perform numerical simulations and compare them to those of the underlying ibm . to numerically solve the sohr model ,",
    "we adapt the relaxation method of @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the unit norm constraint ( [ macro3_intro ] ) is abandonned and replaced by a fully conservative hyperbolic model in which @xmath32 is supposed to be in @xmath17 .",
    "however , at the end of each time step of this conservative model , the vector @xmath32 is normalized .",
    "motsch and navoret showed that the relaxation method provides numerical solutions of the soh model which are consistent with those of the particle model .",
    "the resolution of the conservative model can take advantage of the huge literature on the numerical resolution of hyperbolic conservation laws ( here specifically , we use @xcite ) .",
    "we adapt the technique of @xcite to include the diffusion fluxes . using these approximations ,",
    "we numerically demonstrate the good convergence of the scheme for smooth initial data and the consistency of the solutions with those of the particle vicsek model with repulsion .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce the particle model , its mean field limit , the scaling and the hydrodynamic limit . in section 3 we present the numerical discretization of the sohr model , while in section 4 we present several numerical tests for the macroscopic model and a comparison between the microscopic and microscopic models .",
    "section 5 is devoted to draw a conclusion .",
    "some technical proofs will be given in the appendices .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath33-particles each of which is described by its position @xmath34 , its velocity @xmath35 and its direction @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath4 is the spatial dimension and @xmath38 denotes the unit sphere .",
    "the particle ensemble satisfies the following stochastic differential equations @xmath39 eq .",
    "( [ overdamped1 ] ) simply expresses the spatial motion of a particle of velocity @xmath40 .",
    "eq ( [ overdamped2 ] ) shows that the velocity @xmath40 is composed of two components : a self - propulsion velocity of constant magnitude @xmath9 in direction @xmath41 and a repulsive force proportional to the gradient of a potential @xmath42 with mobility coefficient @xmath10 .",
    "equation ( [ overdamped3 ] ) describes the time evolution of the orientation .",
    "the first term models the relaxation of the particle orientation towards the average orientation @xmath43 of its neighbors with rate @xmath44 .",
    "the second term models the relaxation of the particle orientation towards the direction of the particle velocity @xmath40 with rate @xmath13 .",
    "finally , the last term describes standard independent white noises @xmath45 of intensity @xmath46 .",
    "the symbol @xmath47 reminds that the equation has to be understood in the stratonovich sense . under this condition and",
    "thanks to the presence of @xmath48 , the orthogonal projection onto the plane orthogonal to @xmath49 ( i.e @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the tensor product of two vectors and @xmath52 is the identity matrix ) , the orientation @xmath53 remains on the unit sphere .",
    "we assume that @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath44 @xmath13 , @xmath54 are strictly positive constants .",
    "the repulsive potential @xmath42 is the resultant of binary interactions mediated by the binary interaction potential @xmath55 .",
    "it is given by : @xmath56 where the binary repulsion potential @xmath57 only depends on the distance .",
    "we suppose that @xmath58 is smooth ( in particular implying that @xmath59 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath60 ) .",
    "we also suppose that @xmath61 in particular implying that @xmath62 as @xmath63 . the quantity @xmath64 denotes the typical range of @xmath65 and the fact that @xmath66 ensures that @xmath65 is repulsive . in the numerical test section , we will propose precise expressions for this potential force .",
    "the mean orientation @xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 it is constructed as the normalization of the vector @xmath69 which sums up all orientation vectors @xmath70 of all the particles which belong to the range of the `` influence kernel '' @xmath71 .",
    "the quantity @xmath72 is the typical range of the influence kernel @xmath73 , which is supposed to depend only on the distance .",
    "it measures how the mean orientation at the origin is influenced by particles at position @xmath74 .",
    "here , we assume that @xmath75 is smooth at the origin and compactly supported .",
    "for instance , if @xmath76 is the indicator function of the ball of radius @xmath77 , the quantity @xmath78 computes the mean direction of the particles which lie in the sphere of radius @xmath79 centered at @xmath74 at time @xmath80 .",
    "\\(i ) in the absence of repulsive force ( i.e. @xmath81 ) , the system reduces to the time continuous version of the vicsek model proposed in @xcite .",
    "+ ( ii ) the model presented is the so called overdamped limit of the model consisting of ( [ overdamped1 ] ) and ( [ overdamped3 ] ) and where ( [ overdamped2 ] ) is replaced by : @xmath82 with @xmath83 taking the limit @xmath84 in ( [ nonoverdamped4 ] ) , we obtain ( [ overdamped2 ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , for microscopic swimmers , this limit is justified by the very small reynolds number and the very small inertia of the particles .",
    "we now introduce the mean field kinetic equation which describes the time evolution of the particle system in the large @xmath33 limit .",

    "these figures show that when the repulsive force is large enough , the sohr model can prevent the formation of high concentrations .",
    "by contrast , when this force is small , the sohr model becomes closer to the soh one and high concentrations become possible .",
    "in this final part , we want to compare the sohr system to the hydrodynamic model proposed by degond , liu , motsch and panferov in @xcite ( referred to as dlmp model ) .",
    "this model is derived , in a similar fashion as the sohr model , starting from a system of self - propelled particles which obey to alignment and repulsion .",
    "the main difference is that in the dlmp model , the particle velocity is exactly equal to the self propulsion velocity but the particles adjust their orientation to respond to repulsion as well as alignment .",
    "the resulting model is of soh type and is therefore written ( [ macro6_intro ] ) , ( [ macro7_intro ] ) , but with an increased coefficient in front of the pressure term @xmath306 , this coefficient being equal to @xmath307 .",
    "the initial conditions and numerical parameters are the same as in previous test    in figure [ fig : solution_dlmp_f5 ] , we report the density @xmath2 ( left ) and the flux direction @xmath144 ( right ) for @xmath308 for the dlmp model . comparing figures ( [ fig : solution_f5 ] ) with figure [ fig : solution_dlmp_f5 ] , we observe that the solutions of the sohr and of the dlmp model are different .",
    "the homogenization of the density seems more efficient with the sohr model than with the dlmp model .",
    "this can be attributed to the effect of the nonlinear diffusion terms that are included in the sohr model but not in the dlmp model .",
    "therefore , the way repulsion is included in the models may significantly affect the qualitative behavior of the solution . in practical situations ,",
    "when the exact nature of the interactions is unknown , some care must be taken to choose the right repulsion mechanism .",
    "in this paper , we have derived a hydrodynamic model for a system of self - propelled particles which interact through both alignment and repulsion . in the underlying particle model",
    ", the actual particle velocity may be different from the self - propulsion velocity as a result of repulsion interactions with the neighbors .",
    "particles update the orientation of their self - propulsion seeking to locally align with their neighbors as in vicsek alignment dynamics .",
    "the corresponding hydrodynamic model is similar to the self - organized hydrodynamic ( soh ) system derived from the vicsek particle model but it contains several additional terms arising from repulsion .",
    "these new terms consist principally of gradients of linear or nonlinear functions of the density including a non - linear diffusion similar to porous medium diffusion .",
    "this new self - organized hydrodynamic system with repulsion ( sohr ) has been numerically validated by comparisons with the particle model .",
    "it appears more efficient to prevent high density concentrations than other approaches based on simply enhancing the pressure force in the soh model . in future work , this model will be used to explore self - organized motion in collective dynamics . to this effect",
    ", it will be calibrated on data based on biological experiments , such as recordings of collective sperm - cell motion .",
