    "according to the standard cosmology , during the evolution of the universe , several phase transitions ( pts ) have occurred .",
    "one of the consequences of these out of equilibrium events is the generation of the gravitational waves ( gws ) during and after pts , which opens a new way to explore the early universe .",
    "however , if the cosmological pt is not a first order type , it can not give rise to the gw production .",
    "for a cosmological first order pt , there are two degenerate thermodynamical states separated by a barrier .",
    "tunneling to the new phase is proceeded by the bubble nucleation .",
    "the expansion of these bubbles and finally their collision with each other result in the production of gws @xcite .",
    "furthermore , other different sources for radiating gws have been proposed , which inflationary quantum fluctuations @xcite , cosmic strings @xcite , and black hole ( bh ) collisions @xcite are some of possible sources .",
    "therefore , gws may be applied as a powerful probe on astrophysical and cosmological events in the universe .",
    "+ numerical calculation indicates qcd pt at finite temperature for small and large quark masses was a first order pt @xcite .",
    "however , as lattice qcd shows , the transition is an analytic crossover for intermediate quark masses , particularly for three physical light quarks and small chemical potential @xcite . +",
    "physical qcd has approximate chiral and z(3 ) center symmetries for very small and large quark masses , which three light pions and color screening are remainders of these spontaneously broken symmetries , while for intermediate masses these symmetries are explicitly broken and related order parameters are non - zero at all temperatures .",
    "+ the expectation value of polyakov loop is the relevant order parameter for the confinement - deconfinement pt , which can be read off from the heavy quark potential . in this work ,",
    "we focus on the cosmological qcd pt . at the temperatures about the deconfinement transition",
    ", heavy quarks lost their dynamical importance ; thus we consider pure gauge theory with non - dynamical heavy quarks appropriate for z(3 ) symmetry , broken in the confinement - deconfinement pt with the polyakov expectation value as the order parameter . employing the point that the confinement - deconfinement pt corresponds to hawking - page pt @xcite which is of a first order",
    ", we explain this pt in the ads / qcd context and explore it through possible gws generated during the transition .",
    "+ after the conjecture of ads / cft correspondence and its generalization to gauge / gravity , people have attempted to get a better understanding of qcd and its properties using the dual gravity theory in five dimensions ; the interpretation of the hawking - page pt as the confinement - deconfinement pt @xcite and the computation of the energy loss of heavy quarks moving in the quark gluon plasma @xcite are investigations to fulfill this goal . + the precise dual gravity describing the real qcd is not yet found .",
    "however , so - called ads / qcd is a promising extension which can explain important features of qcd .",
    "the ads / qcd top - down approach first takes into account a string theory , then deforms the dual super yang - mills theory to gain qcd properties such as confinement @xcite while in the other approach , bottom - up , starting with qcd , the dual description is constrained by qcd ingredients .",
    "the conformal isometry of ads space is consistent with uv asymptotic freedom of qcd . in the hard wall model of this approach @xcite to produce confinement , the small radius region of ads is truncated , while for the soft wall model this truncation is smoothly performed by a dilaton field @xcite . in @xcite , the author finds the confinement - deconfinement pt for these two models , which the pt temperature obtained in the soft wall model is very close to the prediction of a lattice calculation .",
    "+ using holographic description of the hard and soft wall models , we try to estimate gws generated from confinement - deconfinement pt .",
    "we relate the duration of the pt to the evaporation time of the bh in these ads spaces and attain a bound on the string length .",
    "the generated gws are obtained for @xmath0 ; extrapolation to large @xmath1 leads to the stronger pt , where @xmath1 is the number of colors .",
    "moreover , we display these gws can be detected by international pulsar timing array ( ipta ) @xcite and square kilometre array ( ska ) @xcite detectors .",
    "+ section ii is devoted to the first order pt parameters characterizing the gw . in section iii",
    ", we introduce the gravity setups and calculate gws in the hard and soft wall models .",
    "we finally summarize the outcomes .",
    "based on einstein s prediction of gws , space - time fluctuation propagates as a wave at the speed of light from their sources . in general relativity",
    ", these gws can be set by linearizing einstein equation of motion ( e.o.m ) . as pointed before out , there are various sources for the gw radiation , which we study the sort of the gw generated from cosmological pts .",
    "+ if a first order pt takes place , the transition into the true vacuum proceeds due to bubble nucleation and percolation .",
    "dynamics of these bubbles plays an important role in gw production .",
    "there are two sorts of combustion modes : detonation and deflagration .",
    "when pt wall expands faster than the speed of sound , combustion occurs through detonation and for deflagration , bubble front moves at the subsonic velocity .",
    "+ bubbles expand and collide with each other .",
    "parts of the stored energy in the walls are converted to gw and also to turbulent motion of the plasma which can itself be another source for gw .",
    "the potent source for the production of gw via bubble collisions comes from detonation bubbles while for the turbulence both modes are viable .",
    "+ to determine gw properties produced from first order pts , numerical calculation is used @xcite .",
    "the method is known as envelope approximation @xcite which simulates pts with the envelope of bubbles and expresses gw spectrum in terms of first order pt parameters .",
    "important parameters of a first order pt affecting gw properties are : the ratio of the vacuum energy density to the thermal energy density of the universe at the pt time , @xmath2 , the duration of the pt , @xmath3 , the velocity of bubble expansion , @xmath4 , the temperature at which the pt occurs , @xmath5 , and the fraction of the vacuum energy which is converted to the kinetic energy of the fluid rather than reheating the fluid , @xmath6 . + using envelope approximation , the contribution of the gw energy density from bubble collision is given by ( we used the numerical fit in @xcite for the spectral shape of gw ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the current value of hubble parameter in units of 100 @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the peak frequency of the gw spectrum is @xmath11 \\big(\\frac{f_*}{\\beta}\\big)\\big(\\frac{\\tau}{h_*}\\big)\\big(\\frac{t_*}{100~\\mathrm{mev}}\\big)\\big(\\frac{g_*}{10}\\big)^{\\frac{1}{6}}.\\ ] ] the characteristic strain amplitude produced by gw is defined as @xmath12 moreover , other parameters are defined as follows ( we used jouguet detonation ) @xmath13,\\ ] ] @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 and the related vacuum energy at the pt is @xmath18 the difference between free energies of two phases is denoted by @xmath19 and the hubble parameter at the temperature @xmath5 is given by @xmath20 where the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom at the pt is @xmath21 and the planck mass is @xmath22 . to calculate qcd pt parameters",
    ", we use hard and soft wall models in the ads / qcd correspondence context .",
    "according to hawking - page pt , there is a first order pt between schwarzschild - ads bh and thermal ads spaces . in @xcite",
    ", witten argued in the dual gauge theory the schwarzschild - ads bh corresponds to deconfinement at the high temperature and thermal ads corresponds to confining phase at the low temperature for the compact boundary , while for the non - compact boundary there is no pt .",
    "however , by introducing ir cut - off in poincar@xmath23 ads spaces , hard wall model , @xcite showed that hawking - page pt would be possible .",
    "+ in this section we obtain necessary parameters within this model .",
    "the five dimensional gravity action dual to gluodynamics with static heavy quarks and negligible baryon chemical potential is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the ricci scalar , @xmath26 is the negative cosmological constant , and @xmath27 is the ads radius .",
    "two solutions for the e.o.m are an euclidean ads in poincar@xmath23 coordinate @xmath28 where the radial coordinate is limited to @xmath29 and @xmath30 corresponds to ir cut - off in the dual gauge theory ; the second solution is the ads - bh whose metric is as follows @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "the thermal ads case has temperature @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the period of the euclidean time , while the hawking temperature of the bh , @xmath37 , is achieved from the near horizon metric .",
    "+ since @xmath38 for these spaces , from ( [ 12 ] ) we can obtain free energy densities as @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the uv cut - off .",
    "setting the bh into the space consistently at @xmath41 leads to @xmath42 which in the limit of @xmath43 , @xmath36 is expressed in terms of bh temperature . for @xmath44 , there is a pt at @xmath45 as seen from the following equation @xmath46 by relating @xmath47 to the mass of the lightest @xmath48 meson , one obtains @xmath49 @xcite and thus @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we can calculate the relevant latent heat at the pt and @xmath2 as @xmath51 which we used @xmath52 and @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the string coupling and tension , respectively .",
    "the larger @xmath2 , the stronger the pt becomes .",
    "therefore , for the large @xmath1 limit , it gives rise to the very strong pt .",
    "+ due to the existence of a pt in these truncated ads spaces and the notion that two phases are not stable and always thermodynamically dominated , we assume the duration of the pt , @xmath3 , can be found by the evaporation time , @xmath56 , of the bh in this space .",
    "to do so , first we should calculate the bh mass .",
    "one can get the energy density of the ads - bh from the renormalized free energy density @xcite @xmath57 by inspiration from a dimensional reduction carried out for 10 dimensional newton constant to gain @xmath58 , we expect the relevant newton constant in this non - compact boundary , @xmath59 , to obtain the bh mass is @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the bh mass can be attained as @xmath61 then , the power of losing energy @xcite , @xmath62 , ( @xmath63 is the bh surface area ) gives @xmath64 hence , according to our assumption @xmath65 .",
    "also , one may find that @xmath0 is consistent with the strongly - coupled su(3 ) gauge theory by considering the effective string tension relation , @xmath66 @xcite , whose value can be obtained from a quark antiquark potential energy calculation @xcite , @xmath67 mev . from this result and ( [ 11 ] ) , we find that for a string length of the order of @xmath68 , it is corresponded to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "+ now , putting the related parameters in ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] ) , and ( [ 4 ] ) , we can identify the generated gw .",
    "the spectrum of gws caused by bubble collisions from a qcd pt ( for @xmath0 ) along with the sensitivity of three detectors @xcite are displayed .",
    "the upper curves are plotted for @xmath69 and the lower curves with @xmath70 . for ipta and ska detectors",
    "these gws would be detectable while elisa can not detect their signals .",
    "the sensitivity of detectors is based on @xcite 20 pulsars with @xmath71 timing precision in 15-year observation time for ipta , and 100 pulsars with @xmath72 timing precision in 20-year observation time for ska . ]     + as seen from fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , described gws are detectable by ipta .",
    "+ ipta is a project consisted of european pulsar timing array ( epta ) , parkes pulsar timing array ( ppta ) , and north american nanohertz observatory for gravitational waves ( nanograv ) which uses millisecond pulsars to detect passing gw sensitive to the frequency range @xmath73 .",
    "( pulsars are rotating neutron stars which radiate electromagnetic waves and can signal a passing gw causing a fluctuation in the arrival time of their pulses . ) + the other relevant detector is ska which is a huge radio telescope and can detect gws using pulsars in the next decade .",
    "however , elisa @xcite space - based interferometer scheduled in 2034 will not be able to detect these gws .      in this case , the gravity action is @xmath74 where the dilaton field is denoted as @xmath75 which in fact is a smooth cap off .",
    "assuming the dilaton field does not backreact on the metric , ads and ads - bh are solutions of the e.o.m .",
    "+ similar to the previous section calculation , one can acquire the free energy density values using the same conditions mentioned in the hard wall model @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 . by calculating @xmath19 ,",
    "one finds there exists a pt for @xmath80 and thus @xmath81 . from calculations of the lightest @xmath48 meson mass in the soft model @xcite , @xmath82",
    "this leads to @xmath83 .",
    "+ also , we can calculate @xmath2 from @xmath19 and by the same argument in the hard wall model , it is found that for a string length of the order of @xmath84 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "+ here , again the qcd pt imprint on the gws is traceable by ipta and ska detectors , fig .",
    "[ 2 ] . in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , the comparison of the gw estimation in the hard and soft wall models is shown . +           + in summary , during the evolution of the universe , for heavy non - dynamical quarks confinement - deconfinement pt was a first order type with non - zero and zero expectation value of polyakov loop , as the order parameter , in the deconfined and confined phase , respectively .",
    "we studied this pt by ads / qcd approach through gws produced by the bubble collision .",
    "+ in the hard and soft wall models of qcd , there exists a first order hawking - page pt corresponded to the confinement - deconfinement pt . using this correspondence , we estimated the gw spectrum associated with the bubble collision during the qcd pt in these models .",
    "envelope approximation provides relevant relations to compute the gws generated from bubble collision . + we assumed that the duration of the pt corresponds to the bh evaporation time in the five dimensional ads space , due to which e.g. @xmath69 , @xmath85 , as the scale of pt duration leads to @xmath86 for the string length in the hard and soft wall models , respectively .",
    "we also calculated the latent heat at the transition and obtained radiated gws for @xmath0 in the models .",
    "the peak frequency falls in @xmath87 band , which ipta and ska will be able to detect their signal as an evidence for this pt .",
