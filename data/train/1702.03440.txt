    "in the 1980 s the laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) was originally proposed for detecting gravitational waves by rainer weiss , richard p. feynman , kip thorne and ronald drever ( web site : @xcite ) .",
    "the principal goal for construction of the ligo was to study astrophysical gravitational waves ( gw ) to stimulate research in fundamental physics concerning the nature of gravity ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent detection of gravitational wave signals gw150914 , gw151226 and lvt151012 by advanced ligo antennas ( @xcite ) has opened such possibility for study the physics of gravitational interaction .    in the situation",
    "when there is no optical ( and other bands ) identification of the gw event , an interpretation of the physics of the gw source is still uncertain . even though the tens solar masses binary black holes coalescence at the distance 400 - 1000 mpc is generally accepted ( @xcite ) , one should also test alternative possibilities which allowed by modern theories of the gravitational interaction ( @xcite , ch.7 ) .    here",
    "we demonstrate that very general physical arguments allow us to distinguish between different polarization states predicted by the scalar - tensor gravitation theories .",
    "actual localization the source of gravitational waves on the sky by means of measurements of the arrival time delays ( between different antennas ) together with relative amplitudes of the detected signals at each antenna can be used for determination the polarization state of the gravitational wave independent on the nature of the gw source .",
    "hence the gw observations give new information about the physics of the gravitational interaction .",
    "l.5     in modern theoretical physics there are two main directions in study of gravitational interaction .",
    "the first approach is the geometrical einstein s general relativity theory ( grt , also called geometrodynamics ) , which is based on the concept of metric tensor @xmath2 of curved riemannian space - time ( @xcite , the standard textbooks : @xcite , @xcite ) .    generally in metric gravitation theories",
    "( metric tensor @xmath2 describes the gravitational potentials ) there are six polarization states ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "three polarizations are transverse to the direction of propagation , with two representing quadrupolar deformations ( transverse tensor wave ) and one representing a monopolar `` breathing '' deformation ( transverse scalar wave ) .",
    "other three modes are longitudinal , including stretching mode in the propagation direction ( longitudinal scalar wave ) .",
    "the second approach is the feynman s non - metric relativistic quantum field gravitation theory ( fgt , also called gravidynamics ) , which is based on the concept of interacting material field in minkowski space - time ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in the frame of the feynman s",
    "field approach the gravitational interaction is described by the symmetric second rank tensor potential @xmath3 . in many observable processes the fundamental role of the scalar part of the tensor potential ( i.e. its trace @xmath4 ) was demonstrated by @xcite . though classical relativistic effects have the same values in both approaches , there are also essential differences in observable relativistic astrophysical effects ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in the frame of the gravidynamics ( feynman s fgt )",
    "the symmetric second rank tensor potential @xmath3 can be decomposed under the lorentz group into the direct sum of subspaces",
    " one spin-2 ( which has five components ) , one spin-1 ( three components ) and two spin-0 representations ( 1 + 1 components ) .",
    "this decomposition and the appropriate projection operators are exhibited explicitly in @xcite .    the diagonal single - component subspace is a spin-0 representation of the lorentz scalar  the trace of the symmetric tensor @xmath4 , plays crucial role in observed relativistic astrophysical processes , including generation and detection of gravitational waves ( review in @xcite ) . after taking into account the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor of the gw sources ,",
    "the field theory predicts existence two different polarization states : the spin-2 transverse tensor waves and the spin-0 longitudinal scalar waves .    in the frame of both metric and field scalar - tensor theories",
    "there are scalar gravitational waves  scalar polarizations .",
    "scalar gw can be generated by such astrophysical processes as binary stars coalescence , pulsation of massive supernova core , and phase transition to quark stars , which could be alternative explanations of the ligo events ( review in @xcite ) .    in fig.([fig : pstates ] ) we show four polarization modes of gravitational waves which are related to the scalar - tensor gravitation theories .",
    "an important task of the gw physics is to distinguish between tensor and scalar gw , including its longitudinal and transverse character .",
    "below we consider how to use the ligo - virgo observations for determination of possible polarization states of gw , and consequently to get new restrictions on fundamental physics of the gravitational interaction .",
    "l.45     we consider pure geometrical calculations of the detected signal amplitudes for gw having different polarization states .",
    "these arguments are very general and strictly determined by the shape of an antenna - pattern , position of the antennas net on the earth , and the sky - position of the source relative to the corresponding antenna - patterns at a fixed sidereal time of the transient gw event .",
    "so considered method does not depend directly on a particular physics of the gw sources .",
    "let us consider gw antenna based on interferometer of the michelson - type .",
    "the antenna has two - arms with four test masses or one - arm with two test masses ( one - arm mode ) .",
    "the receiver is at rest in a local proper reference frame with the origin of spatial coordinates in the corner of the system and the x- and y - axes along the antenna s two arms ( or x - axis for one - arm mode ) .",
    "the arms are orthogonal and have the same length @xmath5 ( for ligo detectors @xmath6 km ) .",
    "the gw passing through the antenna displaces the test masses .",
    "the difference in two arm - lengths is monitored by laser interferometer : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the strain of an incoming gw , observed by an individual detector , @xmath9  its amplitude , @xmath10  its normalized shape ( e.g. @xmath11 ) . @xmath12  the geometrical factor determined by the relative orientation of the gw antenna and the sky position of the gw source ( angles @xmath13 ) at the fixed sidereal time ( st ) of the gw event detection and the polarization angle @xmath14 . in the case of one - arm detector",
