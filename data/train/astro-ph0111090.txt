    "the chemical evolution of the solar neighborhood , as a prototype of galactic disks in general , has been an active field of astrophysical research over the last four decades , starting from the pioneering works of van den bergh ( 1962 ) , schmidt ( 1963 ) , and pagel & patchett ( 1975 ) . with talbot & arnett ( 1971 ) and then tinsley ( 1980 ) , the subject got its elegant physico - mathematical formulation , then adopted in most later works . in this traditional approach chemical evolution is rigorously treated from first principles , adopting specific initial and boundary conditions , along with heavy element yields obtained from theoretical stellar model and supernova explosion calculations .    in this paper",
    "i instead adopt a purely phenomenological approach , lining up a series of observational facts and then building on them semi - quantitative inferences .",
    "this should be regarded as complementary to the traditional approach , and may perhaps drive it towards unexplored regions of the theoretical parameter space .",
    "i also adopt a ` simple minded ' attitude , assuming  when appropriate  that the most straightforward interpretation of the facts is the right one , and no _ cosmic conspiracies _ are at work ( for example , it is subintended that the imf is universal )",
    ". for conciseness the presentation will be somewhat schematic .",
    "clusters are perhaps the best realization in nature of the closed - box model of chemical evolution . within clusters",
    "we find confined in the same place all the dark matter , all the baryons , all the galaxies , all the stars and all the metals , that have participated in the play .",
    "clusters are then good _ archives _ of their past star formation ( sf ) and metal production history .",
    "x - ray observations of clusters provide iron and @xmath4-element abundances in the icm , along with the icm mass .",
    "optical observations provide the luminosity , mass , and the average metallicity of all the stars now locked inside galaxies ( and even hints to a trace population of intergalactic , free - floating stars ) .",
    "optical and near - ir observations of cluster elliptical galaxies have also set tight limits to the formation epoch of the bulk of the stars contained in them .",
    "cumulatively , these observations have then established the following facts ( see renzini 1997 , 1999a , b and extensive references therein for the original sources ) : the average iron abundance in the icm is @xmath5 .",
    "iron mass to light ratio _ is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the mass of the icm , and @xmath9 the total @xmath10-band luminosity of all cluster galaxies . the average iron abundance of cluster stars is roughly solar .",
    "the total iron mass to light ratio is @xmath11 , only weakly dependent on the hubble constant .",
    "the global elemental ratio @xmath12fe ] in the icm+stars is roughly solar , hence the total cluster _ metal mass to light ratio _ is @xmath13 , since in solar proportions @xmath14 .",
    "this is a fully _ empirical _ estimate of the metal yield of a now old stellar population .",
    "most metals are out of galaxies : @xmath15 , i.e. there is @xmath16 times more iron in the icm than there is iron locked into stars , for @xmath17 , or @xmath18 times more for @xmath19 .",
    "massive starbursts promote major , metal - enriched galactic winds ( heckman et al .",
    "most stars in galaxy clusters belong to galactic spheroids ( ellipticals and bulges ) , and formed in massive starbursts at @xmath20 .",
    "note that in @xmath21 both quantities are measured _ now _ ; however , the metal mass @xmath22 was produced and released at very early times by the stellar population that after aging for @xmath23 gyr has faded to the luminosity @xmath9 . in the adopted ` simple - minded '",
    "approach , from these empirical facts the following inferences can be drawn : @xmath24 most metals in clusters ( now partly in the icm , partly in stars ) were produced at @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath24 icm metals were ejected by starburst driven galactic winds at the production time , i.e. at @xmath20 .",
    "to which extent are clusters _ fair samples _ of the universe as a whole ?",
    "they are certainly the highest density peaks in the distribution of matter , both dark and shining , and one may expect sf and chemical evolution to have proceed differently in clusters compared to the low - density _",
    "field_. however , there are also striking similarities , including the following ones : most stars are now in galactic spheroids , in the field as in the clusters ( e.g. up to @xmath25 according to fukugita , hogan , & peebles 1998 ) .",
    "the fraction of baryons now locked into stars is nearly independent of the environment , being @xmath26 in both clusters and field ( e.g. renzini 1997 ; fukugita et al .",
    "the sf histories may well have been different , confined at early times in clusters , more protracted in the field , but the @xmath27 endproducts appear to be very similar , with nearly the same efficiency of baryon to star conversion . field ellipticals and s0 s are very similar to cluster ellipticals and s0 s , with the luminosity - weighed age of their stellar populations being at most @xmath28 gyr less than that of the cluster galaxies ( bernardi et al .",
    "the stellar populations of ( large ) bulges are very similar to ellipticals .",
    "the majority of them appear to follow the same mg@xmath29 relation of ellipticals , while a minority of outliers likely had a significant episode of star sf at later times ( jablonka , martin , & arimoto 1996 ) .",
    "the stellar population of the galactic bulge is nearly as old as galactic globular clusters in halo , or 13 - 15 gyr ( ortolani et al . 1995 ) .",
    "again , from this second series of facts more ` simple - minded ' inferences can be drawn : @xmath24 having the sf proceeded to the same @xmath26 baryon to stars conversion in the general field and in clusters , the global metallicity of the @xmath27 universe has to be nearly the same as that we can actually see in clusters , i.e. @xmath30 solar . @xmath24",
    "the bulk of stars in galactic spheroids  in clusters as well as in the field  formed at @xmath20 . @xmath24 since some 50 to 75% of all stars are now in spheroid , and the bulk of stars in spheroids formed at @xmath20 , the inference is that at least @xmath30 of all stars formed at @xmath20 . this ` fossil evidence ' argument agrees with the direct determination of the sf history at high redshift ( steidel et al . 1999 ) .",
    "@xmath24 therefore , the metallicity of the @xmath31 universe was @xmath30 of its present value , i.e. @xmath32 solar , a _ prompt initial enrichment of the universe _",
    "( renzini 1999a ) .",
    "when did the morphological differentiation of galaxies take place ?",
    "when did the disks of the present - day spirals started to be assembled ? here",
    "are some facts : we see no disk galaxies at @xmath20 .",
    "lyman break galaxies appear to be much smaller , compact objects , most likely the progenitors of today s objects that the fossil evidence date having formed at @xmath20 , i.e. galactic spheroids ( e.g. giavalisco , steidel , & macchetto 1996 ) .",
    "spirals are well in place by @xmath33 , along with passively evolving ellipticals ( e.g. abraham & van den bergh 2001 ) . hence :",
    "@xmath24 bulges come first , formed in starbursts , and disks are slowly added later , if the environment is quiet enough to allow for their formation and survival . @xmath24 the morphological differentiation of galaxies ( the emergence of the hubble sequence ) took place between @xmath34 and @xmath35 , i.e. in the so far poorly explored _ desert _",
    "range @xmath36 .",
    "in the k band the galactic bulge and disk contribute respectively @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( kent , dame , & fazio 1991 ) , and in the @xmath10 band the bulge luminosity is @xmath39 .",
    "> from the cluster empirical yield it follows that the galactic bulge has produced @xmath40 of metals . where are all these metals",
    "? two billion solar masses of metals should not be easy to hide , yet ... the stellar mass of the bulge follows from its @xmath41-band mass to light ratio , @xmath42 ( kent 1992 ) , and its luminosity , hence @xmath43 .",
    "its average metallicity is about solar(mcwilliam & rich 1994 ) , i.e. @xmath44 , and therefore the bulge stars all together contain @xmath45 of metals .",
    "only @xmath1 of the metals produced when the bulge was actively star forming some 13 gyr ago are still in the bulge !",
    "this implies that @xmath46 , or @xmath47 were ejected into the surrounding space by an early wind .",
    "a word of caution is in order .",
    "the estimated the metal yield ( section 2 ) follows from adopting @xmath48 solar .",
    "more recent estimates prefer @xmath49 solar ( de grandi & molendi 2001 ) , the total metal production by the bulge reduces to @xmath50 , of which @xmath0 had to be ejected .",
    "the bottom line is that at least @xmath51 times more metals were ejected , than retained in the bulge .    at the time of bulge formation ,",
    "such @xmath0 of metals run into largely pristine ( @xmath52 ) material , experienced r - t instabilities leading to chaotic mixing , and establishing a distribution of metallicities in a largely inhomogeneous igm surrounding the young bulge .",
    "for example , this enormous amount of metals is able to bring to a metallicity 1/10 solar ( i.e. @xmath53 ) about @xmath2 of pristine material , several times the mass of the yet to be formed galactic disk .",
    "if we look to the formation of the milky way galaxy from a purely empirical point of view , we have an old , now passively evolving bulge , and a younger disk , still forming stars even if  likely  at a reduced rate compared to a more active past .",
    "hence , we can distinguish three main phases in the formation and evolution of our own galaxy .",
    ", some 13 gyr ago ( `` at @xmath34 '' ) .",
    "the relatively fast ( @xmath54 gyr ) assembly of the bulge from smaller subunits promotes a massive starburst ( sfr=10 - 100 @xmath55yr ) , which drives a metal rich wind and @xmath0 of metals are ejected into the surrounding medium .",
    ", lasting a poorly constrained lapse of time ( some gyr ?",
    ", until @xmath56 ? ) , during which the bulge settles into its passive evolution , the ejecta partially mix with the surrounding medium , and a mass some 5 - 10 times larger than the present mass of the galaxy is inhomogeneously contaminated , with its average metallicity being raised to @xmath1 solar .",
    "heating of this metal enriched environment ( mee ) by the early bulge wind , may prevent from a while further growth of the stellar mass of the protogalaxy .",
    ", from @xmath56 to @xmath35 ( ? )",
    ". around the aging bulge , the mee is cooling , infall starts of @xmath57 solar material from the mee , and the galactic disk begins to form and grow .",
    "these semi - quantitative arguments may help settling on a final solution for an old problem . from the earliest times mentioned in the introduction , the existence of a `` g - dwarf problem '' was soon recognized : the solar neighborhood contains far too few metal poor stars ( @xmath58 solar ) compared to the prediction of a simple , closed box model of chemical evolution ( see pagel 2001 , for a recent discussion of the problem ) .",
    "traditional solutions of the g - dwarf problem have considered three options ( or some combination of them ) : an initial _ top heavy _",
    "imf , a _ prompt initial enrichment _ ( pie ) model , and infall , i.e. the gradual assembly of the disk as opposed to a zero metallicity disk fully assembled from the beginning .",
    "the above considerations clearly indicate that pie is inevitable , once one accepts that the bulge comes first and the disk later .",
    "note that infall models have often assumed @xmath52 for the infalling material .",
    "some gradual growth of the disk is also inevitable , being the alternative assumption of instantly assembled disk quite unrealistic .",
    "so , a combination of pie and infall emerges as the natural solution of the old problem .",
    "worth mentioning here is that the idea of the bulge pre - enriching the disk is certainly not new ( see e.g. kppen & arimoto 1990 ) .",
    "this sketchy cartoon of galaxy formation is hard to put in more quantitative terms , purely from first principles .",
    "models would have difficulties to predict the extension of the mee , its distribution of metallicities , the duration of the intermission , the evolution of the infall rate and the disk build up .",
    "all these phenomena involve highly non - linear , weather - like hydrodynamics with little predictive power .",
    "however , we are living in a special time for astronomy , and where theory gets stuck observations can help .",
    "we can actually start to _ see _ directly what theory is not able to predict .    with the current generation of large ground based telescopes , together with the x - ray , optical , and infrared facilities now or soon in space , we have for the first time the possibility to empirically map the growth of galaxies , to follow back in time the disappearance of the hubble sequence , and its emergence , forwards from high to low redshifts ."
