    "the interface between flying and stationary qubits is emerging as a key for progress in quantum information science .",
    "impressive steps have been made toward quantum computing using both atomic @xcite and photonic qubits @xcite .",
    "the ability to reversibly transfer quantum states from single photons to single atoms would enable progress in both of these areas .",
    "from the point of view of optical quantum computing it would enable the single photon sources and memories they require @xcite .",
    "from the point of view of quantum computing using atoms it provides a potentially scalable way of effecting qubit - qubit interactions @xcite .    the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) , that is the regime where an atom - cavity interaction in some way dominates the dissipation processes , is a necessity in order to enable the reversible transfer of states between atoms and photons .",
    "this regime is achieved by having an atom coupled to an electromagnetic field mode in a high - q cavity . at present ,",
    "strong coupling has been achieved experimentally using trapped atoms interacting with whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) @xcite , and fabry - perot cavities @xcite .",
    "it has also been observed in the solid state using quantum dots in wgm @xcite , micropillar @xcite and photonic crystal cavities @xcite .",
    "rare earth ion dopants are interesting systems to look at with respect to cavity qed . like other solid state systems embedded in a dielectric they are particularly amenable to whispering gallery mode and microstructured resonators .",
    "the highest intensity for the mode functions of the resonances of such resonators are , in simple situations , inside the dielectric rather than outside . compared to the difficulties of trapping atoms or ions in evanescent fields ,",
    "the absolute position stability offered by state optical centers is also attractive .",
    "rare earth ion dopants are at the same time much ` cleaner ' than other solid state systems that have been investigated .",
    "they have very long coherence times for their hyperfine transitions @xcite , among the longest of any qubit systems investigated .",
    "this would enable long term storage of photon states @xcite .",
    "they do not suffer from the same spectral diffusion problems as quantum dots @xcite and do not have the strong vibronic coupling of the nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) center @xcite .",
    "another reason for investigating cavity qed with rare earths is that even if it is not possible to extend far into the strong coupling regime , the cavity is able to help with the detection of single dopant ions .",
    "rare earth ion dopants are particularity attractive systems for quantum computing .",
    "the long coherence times contrast strongly with large ion - ion interactions .",
    "these interactions are due to the fact that ions have static electric dipole moments and these dipole moments are different in the ground state and the excited state .",
    "the interaction strength for nearest neighbors is in the region of ghz @xcite .",
    "furthermore the large ratio of inhomogeneous to homogeneous broadening allows closely spaced ions to be easily addressed by tuning the exciting laser @xcite .",
    "these properties have all been measured and rudimentary demonstrations using ensembles made @xcite .",
    "while work has been done into improving the scalability using ensembles @xcite , and alternative architectures such as `` read out ions '' @xcite , the spin selective detection of a single rare earth ion dopant would represent a significant step forward for rare earth ion based quantum computing .",
    "there are two important issues that need to be considered with regards to rare earth ions and cavity qed .",
    "firstly the optical transitions have such long coherence times because their oscillator strengths are weak .",
    "this means that the atom - cavity coupling will be small , making it very difficult to achieve the ` good cavity ' strong coupling regime .",
    "secondly the atomic decay rate can be several orders of magnitude larger than the spontaneous emission rate calculated only from the oscillator strength of the transition to a certain level .",
    "this is due to spontaneous emission to a level other than the ground state followed by rapid non - radiative decay .",
    "there have been a number of investigations into rare earth ion dopants and optical cavities .",
    "wang et al .",
    "@xcite investigated a monolithic fabry - perot resonator as a way of improving the efficiency of photon echoes used for classical signal processing .",
    "ichimura and goto @xcite observed optical bistability and normal - mode splitting in a pr : y@xmath0sio@xmath1 monolithic fabry - perot resonator , and concluded that they were close to achieving the single atom strong coupling regime .",
    "grudinin et al .",
    "@xcite did calculations for sm@xmath2 ions in caf@xmath0 microcavities , and concluded that based on the properties of the free sm@xmath2 ion , the strong coupling regime should be possible .",
    "we are concerned with trivalent rare earth ions which have superior coherence properties .    here",
    "we discuss briefly the strong coupling regime for ideal weak oscillators and how this picture should change for the case of realistic decay processes .",
    "we survey a number of rare earth ion doped systems and discuss their utility in strong coupling cavity qed experiments .",
    "we conclude by investigating some quantum information operations in the bad cavity regime .",
    "we show that the transfer of quantum states between atoms in distant cavities @xcite is still possible and introduce a new method for calculating the driving fields needed for `` quantum impedance matching '' .",
    "we also show that phase shifts on single photons conditional on the state of single atoms @xcite is possible , and suggest a heterodyne based single atom detection scheme based on this .",
    "we first consider a single two - level atom interacting with a single cavity mode and a continuum of other optical modes that will be treated as a bath .",
    "we will assume that the atom is sitting at an antinode of the cavity mode field .",
    "we will first examine the ideal case where the only relaxation process of the atom is due to its interaction with the optical fields .",
    "the dynamics of the system can be described by three rates : the coupling between a single atom and a single photon ( @xmath3 ) , the cavity decay rate ( @xmath4 ) and the atom spontaneous emission rate ( @xmath5 ) . figure [ fig : twolevelcavity ] is a diagram of this model showing the interactions that occur .     - the rate of decay out of the cavity , @xmath5 - the rate of decay through spontaneous emission of the atom .",
    "[ fig : twolevelcavity ] ]    from these constants one can derive two dimensionless numbers ; the critical atom number ( @xmath6 ) , which describes the number of atoms required to have an appreciable effect on the cavity field , and the saturation photon number ( @xmath7 ) , the number of photons required to saturate an atom in the cavity . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are related to the system parameters by the following expressions :    @xmath8    we define the strong coupling regime as being when both the critical atom number and the saturation photon number are less than one , i.e. @xmath9 . by looking at equation ( [ eq : n_0 ] )",
    "we can see that there are two ways that this condition can be achieved .",
    "the first is the ` good cavity ' regime , when the atom - field coupling is greater than the cavity and atomic decay rates i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "weak oscillator strengths make @xmath3 small making it difficult to achieve @xmath11 .",
    "fortunately weak oscillators also lead to small @xmath5 , and while @xmath3 scales linearly with the transition dipole moment , the spontaneous emission rate scales as the transition dipole moment squared .",
    "so for weak oscillators one generally operates in the ` bad cavity ' regime , where the cavity decay rate is larger than the coupling strength , but hopefully the atomic decay rate is still small enough to make @xmath12 .    for a single atom interacting with a single cavity mode we have the following interaction quantum langevin equations @xcite :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the input fields associated with the cavity decay and spontaneous emission respectively . assuming that @xmath4 is much larger than the other timescales , we adiabatically eliminate the cavity mode by setting @xmath16 :    @xmath17    substituting ( [ eq : anotime ] ) into ( [ eq : sigma - time ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmaztime ] ) gives for @xmath18 and @xmath19 :    @xmath20    we can see that after adiabatically eliminating the cavity , the atoms are now described by two decay rates ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath21 represents the spontaneous emission of the atom into free space , and @xmath22 represents the spontaneous emission of the atom through a cavity field mode .",
    "so in the regime where the critical atom number is small , ( @xmath23 ) the atom will decay through the cavity rather than into free space .",
    "for a perfect two - level atom the spontaneous emission rate can be calculated from the oscillator strength of the transition . in reality",
    "there are electronic levels present other than the two involved in the transition .",
    "the atom can spontaneously emit to one of these other levels , then relax the small energy gap to the ground state through much faster phonon decay processes @xcite .",
    "this process can cause the atomic decay rate to be several orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical two - level spontaneous emission rate , as the decay rate now has to be calculated by summing the contributions from all of the allowed transitions .",
    "this decay from the excited state to other energy levels , followed by phonon decay does not have any effect on the dynamics of the atom except to cause the atomic decay rate ( @xmath5 ) to be larger .",
    "in particular the nuclear spin state of the atom is preserved because the decay is much more rapid than timescales over which the hyperfine interaction is appreciable . as a result",
    "the effect of this branched decay path does not change the ideal atom picture , except that the spontaneous emission rate @xmath5 may be disappointingly large if we expect it to be based only on the oscillator strength for the transition coupled to the cavity .    as well as the modification of @xmath5 because of decay to other energy levels , there is also broadening of the homogeneous linewidth ( @xmath24 ) due to excess dephasing .",
    "this dephasing , due to time dependent frequency shifts of the atoms , can be caused by processes such as excitation or relaxation of other ions , the nuclear and electron spins of the host material , and phonon scattering in the ion @xcite .",
    "this last mechanism is temperature dependent and becomes negligible at cryogenic temperatures for the right material systems . in the case of cavity",
    "qed experiments the dominant cause of excess dephasing will most likely be interactions between spins in the host and the electron or nuclear spin of the dopant , as both the concentration of dopant and the amount of optical excitation in the sample will be small . finding",
    "a good host for rare earth ion dopants that does not contain nuclear spins has proved difficult , even in the quietest of hosts such as y@xmath0sio@xmath1 , the nuclear spins of the yttrium contribute significantly to the homogeneous linewidths @xcite .",
    "it has proved possible to `` turn off '' the excess dephasing due to nuclear spins in the hosts in hyperfine transitions in pr : y@xmath0sio@xmath1 @xcite by working at a specific field where the transition has zero first order zeeman dependence . as well as hyperfine transitions , this technique should also be applicable to optical transitions in systems without electron spin , as long as the nuclear spin of the dopant is large enough ( @xmath25 ) to provide a required anti - crossing .    here",
    "we will use @xmath5 for the population decay rate ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the homogeneous linewidth @xmath27 is the sum of linewidth due to population decay and excess dephasing ( @xmath28 ) :    @xmath29    the treatment of the previous section can now be applied to the more realistic system that includes excess dephasing .",
    "we model the excess dephasing with an interaction hamiltonian that couples the atom s population to the momentum of a bath of ground state harmonic oscillators :    @xmath30    where the @xmath31 are the bath operators .",
    "we then follow the approach of gardiner and collett @xcite .",
    "we will again assume that we are in the regime where the cavity decays on a much faster timescale than dephasing of the dopant ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "again by adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode ( @xmath33 ) we derive the quantum langevin equations :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the input field associated with the bath operator @xmath31 .",
    "we can see that dephasing adds an extra term to the equation for @xmath36 which causes @xmath18 to now be described by the rates @xmath22 and @xmath37 ( instead of @xmath21 ) which affects the coherence of the system . on the other hand @xmath38 is unchanged , which means that the population will still decay at the same rates as without excess dephasing .",
    "so when dealing with cavity qed systems in the ` bad cavity ' limit and with excess dephasing , the system should be parametrized by two different critical atom numbers :    @xmath39    where because @xmath40 the phase critical atom number is necessarily larger than the population critical atom number . a small value for the population critical atom number will ensure that if the dopant is excited the spontaneously emitted photon will predominantly be emitted from the cavity . if a single photon pulse in a single spatio - temporal mode or the coherent properties of the fourier transform limited single photon pulse are required , or if one desires to probe the coherent properties of the atom cavity system , then a small phase critical atom number is also necessary .",
    "we are interested in using wgm cavities for achieving strong coupling with rare earth ions because they have the ability to have small mode volumes ( @xmath41 ) while at the same time having high quality factors ( @xmath42 ) @xcite .",
    "we shall show that this ability to simultaneously have small v and high q is required in order to achieve strong coupling in such a system .",
    "crystalline wgm resonators created using mechanical grinding and polishing techniques have achieved some of the highest quality factors of any small optical cavity , with q factors up to @xmath43 being reported in caf@xmath0 resonators @xcite . as coherent spectroscopy of rare earth ion dopants",
    "is typically performed using doped crystals @xcite , crystalline wgm resonators are the logical choice for achieving strong coupling in such systems .",
    "rare earth doped glasses are another option for cavity qed experiments , as it is relatively simple to manufacture glass microsphere cavities with high quality factors ( up to @xmath44 in fused silica @xcite ) .",
    "the problem with using doped glasses is that the homogeneous linewidth of the ions is several orders of magnitude larger than for crystalline hosts @xcite , which would make it very difficult to achieve strong coupling .    in order to reach the strong coupling regime",
    "we require the atom - cavity coupling to be large while the atomic and cavity decay rates are small .",
    "we here investigate how these rates specifically relate to rare earth doped cavities , in particular wgm cavities .",
    "the cavity decay rate is given by @xcite :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is the wavelength of light in the cavity .",
    "the coupling strength is given by the equation @xcite :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the refractive index of the cavity and @xmath49 is the frequency of the transition . from this equation",
    "we can see that in order to have large coupling we require the cavity mode volume to be small .",
    "the transition dipole moment ( @xmath50 ) of the atom can be calculated from the atom s oscillator strength ( f ) using the expression @xcite :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the local correction to the electric field to account for the fact that the ion is less polarisable than the bulk medium @xcite .",
    "the transitions between 4f levels in the rare earths are of particular interest when looking at cavity qed applications due to their long population and coherence lifetimes . having long lifetimes",
    "means that the atomic decay rates are very small , which makes it easier to get into a strong coupling regime ( because @xmath53 and @xmath54 , as explained in section ii ) .",
    "having small atomic decay rates makes it easy to get into a regime where ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 .",
    "this will enable the use of larger cavities than are traditionally used for cavity qed experiments , as @xmath57 .",
    "using millimetre sized resonators is desirable for two main reasons : 1 ) they are easy to fabricate ( can be made by hand using a standard lathe ) , 2 ) they can be tuned easily by deformation of the resonator . from equation ( [ eq : n_0 ] )",
    "we can see that having a very small @xmath5 means that it is easy to achieve @xmath58 .",
    "so when dealing with rare earths the main issue is having @xmath4 small enough ( high q factor ) that @xmath12 .",
    "the spontaneous emission time @xmath59 is the time it would take for the excited state of the atom to relax to the ground state if it was just a simple two - level atom with no other energy levels present .",
    "@xmath59 is related to the transition dipole moment of the atom @xcite :    @xmath60    in terms of the properties of the rare earth ion transition ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath59 ) we can write the critical atom and saturation photon numbers as :    @xmath63    @xmath64    @xmath65    where we have introduced a new dimensionless parameter @xmath66 that describes the mode volume of the cavity compared to the wavelength cubed @xcite . :    @xmath67    table  [ fig : qedparams ] shows parameters for a number of rare earth ion systems .",
    "purely by looking at the ratios of @xmath68 and @xmath69 we would say that the @xmath70h@xmath71 - @xmath70h@xmath72 transition in tm@xmath73:linbo@xmath74 would be the best option for investigating strong coupling , while the @xmath75i@xmath76 - @xmath75f@xmath77 transition in nd@xmath73:yvo@xmath78 and the @xmath75i@xmath79 - @xmath75i@xmath80 transition in er@xmath73:y@xmath0sio@xmath1 are also possibilities .",
    "the @xmath70h@xmath78 - @xmath81d@xmath0 transition in pr@xmath73:yag is another likely candidate as it has a small @xmath69 ratio .",
    "the @xmath68 ratio is not as good as the others , but by applying magnetic field to the system it should be possible to lengthen the dephasing time .

    "[ fig : rvq],scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "one of the great promises of cavity qed is the ability to use light to transfer quantum states between the metastable ground states of two different atoms @xcite . here",
    "we show this to be possible in the bad cavity regime and introduce a new method for calculating which pulse shape is required from the coupling beams in order to achieve the `` quantum impedance matching '' .    here",
    "we consider two lambda systems in two separate cavities with the output of one cavity driving the other as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : throw_catch ] .     and @xmath86 represent cavity modes and @xmath87 and @xmath88 classical driving fields , perhaps introduced from the side of the cavity . [",
    "fig : throw_catch ] ]    we start with the hamiltonian for a single lambda system in a cavity :    @xmath89    following a similar procedure to section ii we derive a set of quantum langevin equations that describe the time evolution :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 , etc .    because we are interested in the case of at most one excitation of this system , it is sufficient for us to consider the amplitudes given by :    @xmath92    where @xmath93 refers to the cavity being in the vacuum state and the atom being in state 1 .",
    "this leads to equations of motion : @xmath94    where :    @xmath95    now suppose we arrange it so that the output of system 1 drives the input of system 2 ( which is identical to system 1 ) , i.e. @xmath96 then we can write a combined set of equations of motion for the entire system :    @xmath97    solving these equations will give an expression for @xmath98 showing how the rabi frequency of the atoms needs to be driven in order to achieve a pulse being emitted at the first node which propagates and is then received at the second node ( hence the throw and catch ) .",
    "to do this we write the equation of motion for the state vector @xmath99 as :    @xmath100    where :    @xmath101    we can take the input - output relation for the system :    @xmath102 \\rho\\ ] ]    differentiate twice with respect to @xmath103 :    @xmath104 a \\rho \\\\ \\ddot{\\beta}_{out } & = & \\ddot{\\beta}_{in } + 2 \\kappa \\dot{\\beta}_{in } + \\sqrt{2 \\kappa } [ 1 0 0 ] a^2 \\rho \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sqrt{2 \\kappa } [ 1 0 0 ] a b \\rho \\omega(t ) + 2 \\kappa a(1,1 ) \\beta_{in}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this can then be rearranged to get an expression for the required rabi driving field in terms of the input and output fields :    @xmath105 a^2 \\rho }     { \\sqrt{2 \\kappa } [ 1 0 0 ] a b \\rho}\\ ] ]    now we have an expression for the rabi driving field that can be used to model the transfer of information between two nodes .",
    "this is done by setting the output field of the first node as a gaussian and calculating the @xmath98 required to achieve this output .",
    "we then use the fact that absorbtion of a photon is the time reverse of emitting a photon to get the driving field at node 2 , which is just the time reversed field at node 1 .",
    "the results of a simulation showing successful quantum state transfer is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : throwandcatch ] .     and as the driving field",
    "is applied it gets transferred via a ramen process to state @xmath106 , emitting a photon into the cavity mode in the process .",
    "this photon is then completely absorbed at node 2 placing that atom in state @xmath107 .",
    "note that the units of time and @xmath98 are arbitrary and have been set to fit the parameters used in the simulation ( @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) .",
    "[ fig : throwandcatch],scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "one way to use the optical cavity to enable single dopant detection is as a collecting lens for the fluorescence and then photon counting .",
    "this has a number of benefits over a conventional collecting lens : firstly the lens is narrow band meaning that it will only collect fluorescence over its linewidth , and secondly in the strong coupling regime the effective decay rate of the atom ( @xmath111 ) is increased leading to higher count rates . as in general",
    "the cavity will be resonant with the transition from one particular ground state hyperfine level to one particular excited state hyperfine level , working in the strong coupling regime will improve the cyclicity of the transition .",
    "this is important as except for complicated schemes based on parity conservation @xcite it is difficult to find a cyclic transition in rare earth ion dopants .",
    "the emission rates will still be small , of the order of tens of kilohertz .",
    "this along with the poor cyclic nature of the rare earth ion transitions , and finite dark count rates of single photon detectors , will make single state readout difficult .",

    "we show that this conditional phase shift is still present in the bad cavity limit , even though the vacuum rabi splitting is small compared to the cavity linewidth .",
