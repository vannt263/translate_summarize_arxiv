    "words are finite sequences of symbols , called letters , belonging to a given set @xmath0 , called an alphabet . in these lectures we discuss an approach to combinatorics of words based on their analogy with curves on the plane . to begin with , consider figure [ fig1 ] depicting a plane curve with distinguished origin and orientation .",
    "the three crossing points of the curve are labeled by letters @xmath1 .",
    "now , starting at the origin we move along the curve .",
    "the first crossing met is labeled @xmath2 , the second one @xmath3 , and so on .",
    "finally we return to the origin and stop .",
    "writing down the labels of the crossings as we encounter them , we obtain the word @xmath4 .",
    "this procedure , deriving a word from a closed plane curve with labeled double transversal intersections was introduced by gauss @xcite in his attempt to classify such curves .",
    "clearly , every letter appears in the resulting word twice .",
    "words in which every letter appears twice are called gauss words .",

    "we generalize the above picture in the following three directions .",
    "first of all , we allow curves with self - crossings of arbitrary multiplicity @xmath8 .",
    "for example , the word associated with the curve in figure [ fig3 ] is @xmath9 . in general , the number of occurrences of the label of a crossing in the associated word is equal to the multiplicity of this crossing . to handle letters appearing only once",
    ", we may distinguish a finite set of generic points on the curve and label them as well ; we shall not do that here .",
    "[ cc][cc]@xmath2 [ cc][cc]@xmath3 , title=\"fig : \" ]    the second direction in which we may generalize is to allow _ unlabeled _ or _ virtual _ crossings . such crossings do not contribute at all to the associated word .",
    "for example , the curve in figure [ fig4 ] gives rise to the word @xmath10 .",
    "the idea of unlabeled crossings is inspired by the theory of virtual knots introduced by l. kauffman @xcite .",

    "there are three crossings @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , all labeled by the same letter @xmath14 .",
    "this leads us to so - called tale words that are words in an alphabet projecting to the given ( fixed ) alphabet @xmath0 .",
    "the curve on figure [ fig5 ] gives rise to the tale word @xmath15 where the letters @xmath16 project to @xmath17 .",

    "the general scheme of the topology of words is as follows : arbitrary words on the given alphabet @xmath0 are approximated by nanowords and the latter are studied by methods inspired by the topology of curves .",
    "it is certainly interesting for topologists to apply topological methods to study such new objects .",
    "our approach also leads to new questions concerning combinatorics of words .",
    "the accent in this theory shifts from words themselves to transformations of words , inspired by topology .",
    "the situation is similar to the one in knot theory where one focuses on isotopy classes of knots rather than on specific knot diagrams .",
    "the present exposition follows my lectures given in the research institute for mathematical sciences ( rims , kyoto ) in february 2006 and is based on my papers @xcite@xcite .",

    "in this section we clarify the relations between curves , knots , and nanowords .      in the sequel ,",
    "the word curve \" means the image of a generic immersion of an oriented circle into an oriented surface . here",
    "`` generic '' means that the curve has only a finite set of self - intersections , which are all double and transversal .",
    "the curve may be immersed into any oriented surface , of any genus , compact or not , with boundary or not .",
    "note that all self - intersections of a curve look locally like @xmath228{2 - 2.eps}\\end{minipage}$ ] .",
    "triple points and self - tangencies are not allowed .",
    "every curve has a _",
    "regular neighborhood_. this is a narrow band around the curve inside the surface , see figure [ 2 - 1 ] .",

    "a curve is _ pointed _ if it is provided with a base - point which is not a self - intersection .",
    "an example of a pointed curve is drawn on figure [ 2 - 1 ] :    [ cc][cc]basepoint [ cc][cc]regular [ cc][bc]neighborhood     two pointed curves are _ stably homeomorphic _ if their regular neighborhoods look exactly the same including the position of the curves in these neighborhoods .",

    "two pointed curves are stably homeomorphic if there is an orientation - preserving homeomorphism of their regular neighborhoods mapping the first curve onto the second one and preserving the origin and the orientations of the curves .    the stable homeomorphism class of a curve is determined solely by the germ of the ambient surface near the curve ; what happens outside a regular neighborhood does not matter .",
    "in particular , adding handles and punctures to the surface away from a neighborhood of the curve does not change its stable homeomorphism class .    recall the definition of the _ stable equivalence _ of curves from @xcite , @xcite .",

    "we note here three geometric invariants of pointed curves preserved under the stable equivalence : the minimal crossing number , the genus , and the virtual number .",

    "one simply does not look at the virtual crossings or , equivalently , trades a branch of @xmath5 near each virtual crossing for a branch going along a small 1-handle attached to @xmath7 and avoiding the rest of the curve .",
    "the virtual number @xmath233 is the minimal integer @xmath234 such that there is a pointed curve on @xmath7 with @xmath235 virtual crossings representing the stable equivalence class of @xmath5 .",

    "we can expand @xmath711 where @xmath684 and @xmath695 .",
    "the resulting sequence @xmath712 is well - defined up to insertion or deletion of consecutive pairs @xmath713 and @xmath714 . deleting all such pairs ,",
    "we obtain a uniquely defined sequence @xmath715 with @xmath716 which is a homotopy invariant of @xmath96 .",

    "this result was claimed at the end of section [ fgi134 ] .",
    "one might think that such a powerful invariant as the characteristic sequence should distinguish arbitrary non - homotopic nanowords .",
    "however this is not true , as shows the following example .",
    "pick four letters @xmath728 ( possibly coinciding ) and consider the nanoword @xmath729 an inspection shows that if @xmath730 and @xmath731 , then the @xmath0-pairing of @xmath96 is primitive .",

    "one may try to classify words by first classifying nanowords .",
    "however , short words may desingularize into quite long nanowords .",
    "for example , the word @xmath738 , desingularizes into a nanoword of length @xmath739 . still , a classification of words of length @xmath737 does not look unrealistic because they desingularize into a quite particular set of nanowords .",
