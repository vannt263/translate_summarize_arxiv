    "one of the most important problems of quantum information theory @xcite is the characterization of mixed states of composed quantum systems . in particular",
    "it is of primary importance to test whether a given quantum state exhibits quantum correlation , i.e. whether it is separable or entangled",
    ". for low dimensional systems there exists simple necessary and sufficient condition for separability .",
    "the celebrated peres - horodecki criterium @xcite states that a state of a bipartite system living in @xmath1 or @xmath2 is separable iff its partial transpose is positive .",
    "unfortunately , for higher - dimensional systems there is no single universal separability condition .",
    "the most general approach to separability problem is based on the following observation @xcite : a state @xmath3 of a bipartite system living in @xmath4 is separable iff @xmath5 for any hermitian operator @xmath6 satisfying @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are projectors acting on @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "recall , that a hermitian operator @xmath12 is an entanglement witness @xcite iff : i ) it is not positively defined , i.e. @xmath13 , and ii ) @xmath14 for all separable states @xmath15 . a bipartite state @xmath3 living in @xmath4",
    "is entangled iff there exists an entanglement witness @xmath6 detecting @xmath3 , i.e. such that @xmath16 . clearly , the construction of entanglement witnesses is a hard task .",
    "it is easy to construct @xmath6 which is not positive , i.e. has at leat one negative eigenvalue , but it is very difficult to check that @xmath17 for all separable states @xmath15 .    the separability problem may be equivalently formulated in terms positive maps @xcite : a state @xmath3 is separable iff @xmath18 is positive for any positive map @xmath19 which sends positive operators on @xmath11 into positive operators on @xmath10 . due to the celebrated choi - jamiokowski @xcite isomorphism",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between entanglement witnesses and positive maps which are not completely positive : if @xmath19 is such a map , then @xmath20 is the corresponding entanglement witness ( @xmath21 stands for the projector onto the maximally entangled state in @xmath4 ) . unfortunately , in spite of the considerable effort , the structure of positive maps ( and hence also the set of entanglement witnesses ) is rather poorly understood [ 744 ] .",
    "now , among positive linear maps the crucial role is played by indecomposable maps",
    ". these are maps which may detect entangled ppt states . among indecomposable maps",
    "there is a set of maps which are characterized by the ` weakest positivity ' property : they are called _ atomic maps _ and they may be used to detect states with the ` weakest ' entanglement .",
    "the corresponding entanglement witnesses we call indecomposable and atomic , respectively .",
    "there are only few examples of indecomposable maps in the literature ( for the list see e.g. the recent paper @xcite ) .",
    "the set of atomic ones is considerably smaller .",
    "interestingly , choi first example @xcite of indecomposable positive map turned out to be an atomic one . recently",
    ", hall @xcite and breuer @xcite considered a new family of indecomposable maps ( they were applied by breuer @xcite in the study of rotationally invariant bipartite states , see also @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we show that these maps are not only indecomposable but also atomic .",
    "moreover , we show how to generalize this family to obtain a large family of new positive maps .",
    "we study which maps within this family are indecomposable and which are atomic .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we introduce a natural hierarchy of positive convex cones in the space of ( unnormalized ) states of bipartite @xmath22 quantum systems and recall basis notions from the theory of entanglement witnesses and positive maps .",
    "section [ sec - bh ] discusses properties of the recently introduced indecomposable maps @xcite and provides the proof that these maps are atomic .",
    "finally , section [ new ] introduces a new class of indecomposable maps and studies which maps within this class are atomic . a brief discussion is included in the last section .",
    "let @xmath23 denote a set of @xmath0 complex matrices and let @xmath24 be a convex set of semi - positive elements in @xmath23 , that is , @xmath24 defines a space of ( unnormalized ) states of @xmath25-level quantum system . for any @xmath26 denote by @xmath27 a schmidt number of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this notion enables one to introduce the following family of positive cones : @xmath28 one has the following chain of inclusions @xmath29 clearly , @xmath30 is a cone of separable ( unnormalized ) states and @xmath31 stands for a set of entangled states . note , that a partial transposition @xmath32 gives rise to another family of cones : @xmath33 such that @xmath34 .",

    "the importance of atomic maps follows from the fact that they may be used to detect the ` weakest ' bound entanglement , that is , atomic maps can detect states from @xmath60 .    actually , strmer definition @xcite is rather difficult to apply in practice . using the choi - jamiokowski isomorphism @xcite we may assign to any linear map @xmath61 the following operator @xmath62 : @xmath63 where @xmath21 stands for ( unnormalized ) maximally entangled state in @xmath64 . if @xmath65 @xmath66 is an orthonormal basis in @xmath67 , then",

    "we shall call them _ atomic entanglement witnesses_. it is clear that @xmath6 is an atomic entanglement witness if there is an entangled state @xmath106 such that @xmath107 .",
    "the knowledge of atomic witnesses , or equivalently atomic maps , is crucial : knowing this set we would be able to distinguish all entangled states from separable ones .",
    "recently breuer and hall @xcite analyzed the following class of positive maps @xmath41 @xmath108 where @xmath109 is an antisymmetric unitary matrix in @xmath110 which implies that @xmath25 is necessarily even and @xmath111 ( for @xmath112 the above map is trivial @xmath113 ) .",

    "it shows that a general breuer - hall map @xmath151 is unitary equivalent to @xmath152 @xmath153 and hence ( after normalization ) to the robertson map @xmath154 with @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
