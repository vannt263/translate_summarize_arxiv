    "it is expected that a viable quantum theory of gravity will have to say something about what happens to the curvature singularities in classical solutions of general relativity .",

    "this is the quantum resolution of the coulomb potential in quantum mechanics , where the basic result is that the expectation value @xmath3 is finite in all eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "this kinematic result together with dynamical coulomb scattering may be taken to constitute quantum singularity avoidance associated with the classically singular @xmath4 potential .    in the hamiltonian approach to quantum gravity ,",
    "the problem of quantization from a mathematical point of view is to find a suitable representation of an algebra of functions of position and momentum as operators on a hilbert space .",
    "the wheeler - dewitt approach utilizes a functional schrodinger representation where the basic variables are the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) variables @xcite . the loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) approach uses a poisson algebra of functions of a connection and triad , based on loops and surfaces , to build a quantum theory  @xcite .",
    "the basic variables quantized are the holonomy of the connection along a curve , and the integral of the ( densitized ) triad over a surface .",
    "the latter approach naturally leads to a non - separable kinematical hilbert space associated with graphs embedded in a spatial manifold  @xcite . because of the association of kinematic states with graphs",
    ", there is an intrinsic spatial discreteness built into the quantum theory which is not a priori present in the schrdinger approach .",
    "field excitations of the basic operators are probed on graphs rather than at points .",
    "an approach similar to that of loop quantum gravity can be employed for the quantum mechanics of a particle moving in a potential in one or more dimensions . here",
    "graphs are replaced by lattices of spatial points ( not necessarily equispaced ) , and the basic observables realized in the quantum theory are the configuration and translation operators .",
    "this is of course natural since generators of infinitesimal translations can not be represented on a spatial lattice . for a given equispaced lattice , the position eigenstates are normalizable , and",
    "the hilbert space is obviously separable .",
    "however , the hilbert space that incorporates all possible lattices ( equispaced or not ) is non - separable .",
    "the quantum theory that utilizes this space has been referred to as polymer quantization  @xcite .    from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "conventional schrdinger quantization and polymer quantization are inequivalent . in the former ,",
    "wave functions are square - integrable functions on  @xmath5 , with position and momentum operators acting as multiplication and differential operators , respectively .",
    "a  remarkable fact is that this is quantization is unique up to unitary equivalence provided that the configuration space of the system is topologically @xmath5 and that the representation of the weyl - heisenberg algebra of exponentiated position and momentum operators is weakly continuous  @xcite .",
    "it is known , however , that if either of these assumptions is abandoned , there are infinitely many inequivalent representations .",
    "a  simple example is a system where the configuration space is the torus rather than  @xmath5 .",
    "polymer quantization provides another example .",
    "its non - separable hilbert space may be viewed as the inductive limit of the separable hilbert spaces associated with quantum mechanics on all possible lattices , including the one - parameter family of equispaced ones .    from a practical viewpoint , since only a finite number of calculations are possible , the full polymer hilbert space can never be utilized .",
    "rather , only a separable subspace is computationally useful . in this case",
    ", however , polymer quantization appears to reduce to the finitely - differenced schrdinger equation on a lattice .",
    "we elaborate on this below by observing that various finite difference schemes for differential equations may be rewritten using configuration and translation operators on a lattice .    in the representation used in lqg",
    ", there is a way to write inverse triad operators using certain classical poisson bracket identities due to thiemann  @xcite .",
    "these identities are in fact much more general than the context in which they first arose ; similar ones may be written for any theory on a lattice .",
    "they may be used to write inverse scale factor operators that are bounded on kinematical states in quantum cosmology in both the connection - triad and adm variables @xcite , as well as curvature operators for a field theoretic formalism for gravitational collapse @xcite .",
    "the boundedness property of such operators has been used in discussions of singularity avoidance in quantum gravity at the kinematical level  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply these ideas of singularity avoidance in quantum gravity to polymer representation quantum mechanics on @xmath0 with the singular @xmath1 potential . for @xmath6 , and with an appropriate boundary condition at @xmath2 ,",
    "this may be thought of as the spherically symmetric sector of the coulomb problem on  @xmath5 .",
    "we address two main questions .",
    "first , we show that in any lattice context , the lqg singularity resolution technique is equivalent to replacing a singular derivative by a non - singular finite difference scheme .",
    "second , we show that even after the singularity in the potential has been resolved , the spectra in the symmetric and antisymmetric sectors are significantly different .",
    "the latter is close to the usual coulomb spectrum when the lattice spacing is much below the bohr radius , but in the former the lattice spacing plays a role similar to a continuum self - adjointness boundary condition at @xmath2 , and the effect on the ground state is significant even when the spacing is much below the bohr radius .",
    "we conclude that boundary conditions at the singularity have a significant effect on the polymer quantization spectrum even after the singularity itself has been regularized .",
    "the rest of the paper is as follows : in section [ sec : polymer ] we recall the basic structure of polymer quantization on  @xmath0 .",
    "in section [ sec : radialcoulomb ] we specialize to the potential  @xmath1 , introducing the lattice regularization of the potential and showing that the boundary conditions of the radial coulomb problem can be implemented by the restriction to the antisymmetric sector .",
    "our numerical results for the spectrum are given in section  [ sec : spectrum ] .",
    "the symmetric sector is analyzed in section  [ sec : symmetric ] .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] summarizes the results and discusses their implications and limitations for the problem of singularity resolution in quantum gravity .",
    "in this section we briefly describe how a mechanical system is quantized in the polymer representation  @xcite . to keep the notation simple , and because the radial coulomb problem we discuss later is a one - dimensional system , we will consider a particle on the real line .",
    "the generalization to @xmath7 particles in @xmath5 is straightforward .",
    "recall that the hilbert space for the schrdinger quantization of a particle on the real line is @xmath8 , the space of square - integrable functions on @xmath0 in the lebesgue measure .",
    "the operators corresponding to configuration and momentum variables act respectively as multiplication and differentiation operators .",
    "the hilbert space is separable ; an example of a countable basis are the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions .    to introduce polymer quantization on  @xmath0 , we start with the basis states _",
    "x_0(x ) = \\",
    "{    r l 1 , & x = x_0 + 0 , & xx_0  .    .",
    "[ eq : basisstates ] the polymer hilbert space is the cauchy completion of the linear span of these basis states in the inner product _ x , _",
    "x = _ x , x , [ eq : ip ] where the quantity on the right - hand side is the kronecker ( rather than dirac ) delta .",
    "this space is clearly nonseparable , and hence inequivalent to @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "intuitively , building from the polymer basis states a single nonzero @xmath8 state would require an uncountable superposition , and thus lead to an unnormalizable state in the polymer hilbert space .",
    "conversely , any state in the polymer hilbert space has support on at most countably many points , and will thus represent the zero state in @xmath8 .",
    "next we define the action of the basic quantum operators .",
    "the position operator @xmath9 acts by multiplication , ( ) ( x ) = x ( x ) , [ eq : xhat - action ] and its domain contains the linear span of the basis states  ( [ eq : basisstates ] ) .",
    "the translation operators @xmath10 , @xmath11 , act by ( _ ) ( x ) = ( x + ) , [ eq : uhat - action ] and are clearly unitary",
    ". formulas ( [ eq : xhat - action ] ) and ( [ eq : uhat - action ] ) are identical to those in @xmath8 . in @xmath8 ,",

    "by contrast , in the polymer hilbert space the action of @xmath10 is not weakly continuous in  @xmath12 , and a basic momentum operator does not exist .    the states in the polymer hilbert space can be described as points in a certain compact space , the ( harald ) bohr compactification of the real line , and the operators introduced above can be described in terms of a representation of the weyl algebra associated with the classical position and momentum variables @xcite .",
    "there exists also a mirror - image quantization in which a a momentum operator and a family of translation operators in the momenta exist , but there is no basic position operator  @xcite .",
    "these mathematical structures will however not be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "as there is no basic momentum operator , any phase space function containing the classical momentum  @xmath16 , most importantly the hamiltonian , has to be quantized in an indirect way .",
    "following  @xcite , we fix a length scale @xmath17 and define    [ eq : p - and - psquared ] @xmath18    the hamiltonian operator that corresponds to the classical hamiltonian @xmath19 is then = ( 2- _ - ^ _ ) + , [ h ] where @xmath20 is assumed so regular that @xmath21 can be defined by pointwise multiplication , @xmath22 . in @xmath8 , the @xmath23 limit in ( [ eq : p - and - psquared ] ) would give the usual momentum and momentum - squared operators @xmath24 and  @xmath25 , and the kinetic term in ( [ h ] ) would reduce to @xmath26 . in the polymer hilbert space the @xmath23 limit does not exist , and @xmath12 is regarded as a fundamental length scale . for @xmath27 ,",
    "one expects the polymer dynamics to be well approximated by the schrdinger dynamics , and certain results to this effect are known @xcite .",
    "although the polymer hilbert space is nonseparable , the dynamics generated by @xmath28 ( [ h ] ) breaks into separable superselection sectors . to discuss this , it is convenient to introduce a dirac bra - ket notation in which the basis state @xmath29 ( [ eq : basisstates ] ) is denoted by  @xmath30 . from ( [ eq : ip ] ) , ( [ eq : xhat - action ] ) and ( [ eq : uhat - action ] ) we then have @xmath31 the action of @xmath28 on @xmath32 gives a state with support at @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath32 thus has support only on the regular @xmath12-spaced lattice @xmath36 .",
    "this means that the time evolution breaks into superselection sectors , where each sector has support on a regular @xmath12-spaced lattice and is hence separable , and the sectors can be labelled by the lattice point @xmath37 .",
    "the time evolution of any given initial state will consequently have support only on a countable union of @xmath12-spaced lattices .",
    "the upshot is that the time evolution of any separable subspace is restricted to a separable subspace .",
    "thus , even though the polymer hilbert space is nonseparable , the fundamental length scale @xmath12 and the choice of an initial state or an initial separable subspace will result in quantum dynamics that takes place in a separable hilbert space .",
    "we note that on a fixed @xmath12-spaced lattice , the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) agrees with a conventional discretisation of schrdinger s equation by the replacement ",
    "( x_n ) ( _ n+1 - 2_n + _",
    "this suggests investigating versions of ( [ h ] ) in which the kinetic term is replaced by an operator that , in the finite difference approximation context , is higher - order accurate in  @xmath12 .",
    "the discussion of superselection sectors would extend to such versions with only minor changes . as the main interest in the present paper concerns singular potentials rather than",
    "higher order accurate discretizations of the second derivative , we shall work with  ( [ h ] ) .    in summary , the restriction of the polymer dynamics into any of its superselection sectors is mathematically equivalent to a conventional discrete approximation to the continuum schrdinger equation on the corresponding equispaced lattice .",
    "the conceptual difference is , however , that in the polymer theory the lattice spacing is regarded as a new fundamental scale .",
    "reduction of schrdinger s equation with the coulomb potential to the spherically symmetric ( @xmath38 ) sector yields the radial hamiltonian operator _ = - - , [ hyd ] acting in the hilbert space of square integrable functions on @xmath39 in the measure @xmath40 @xcite .",

    "the spectrum then consists of the positive continuum and the negative discrete eigenvalues _",

    "[ eq : continuum - en ] we shall return to the other possible choices of the self - adjointness boundary condition in section  [ sec : symmetric ] .    to introduce a polymer counterpart of @xmath42 along the lines of  ( [ h ] ) , we need to address the positivity of  @xmath41 , the boundary condition at @xmath45 , and the singularity of the potential at @xmath43 . suppressing the singularity issue for the moment",
    ", the first two issues can be solved by extending @xmath41 to negative values : denoting this extended coordinate by @xmath46 , and assuming that the discretized potential is symmetric under the reflection @xmath47 , we require the states to be antisymmetric under @xmath47 . in the two superselection sectors in which the lattice points are at respectively @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 , this antisymmetry condition just chooses the antisymmetric states .",
    "the remaining superselection sectors are pairwise coupled by the antisymmetry condition . however , since the potential is by assumption symmetric under @xmath47 , the energy eigenvalues can be found within each sector without using an antisymmetry condition , and the antisymmetric eigenstates are then obtained by just taking appropriate linear combinations .",
    "let us return now to the singularity of the potential at @xmath2 .",
    "although this issue only arises in the single superselection sector that has a lattice point at @xmath2 , we wish to give a prescription that handles all the superselection sectors in a unified manner .",
