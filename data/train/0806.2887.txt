    "reionization is generally believed to be the outcome of the release of ionizing radiation by galaxies undergoing star formation ( see for example @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "current theory suggests that the galaxies responsible for most of this radiation are dwarf galaxies more massive than about @xmath6 . in the cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "universe nonlinear structures form from initially small - amplitude , gaussian - random - noise density fluctuations , by a continuous hierarchical sequence of mergers and infall with the smallest galaxies forming first and merging to yield larger ones , forming the cosmic web of structures ( fig .",
    "[ web ] ) .",
    "while dark matter dominates the gravitational forces which cause this structure formation , ordinary atomic matter must join the dark matter in making galaxies for star formation to be possible .",
    "once the atomic gas in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) in some region is heated by reionization , however , gas pressure opposes gravitational collapse , and , thereafter , the smallest galaxies form without atomic matter and can not make stars .",
    "the minimum mass of star forming galaxies in such regions is about one billion solar masses .    due to the complex nature of the reionization process",
    "it is best studied through large - scale numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "such simulations present considerable challenges related to the large dynamic range required and the necessity to perform fast and accurate radiative transfer calculations .",
    "the tiny galaxies which are the dominant contributors of ionizing radiation must be resolved in very large cosmological volumes , large enough to contain billions of times more total mass than one dwarf galaxy and up to tens of millions of such galaxies , in order to correctly derive their numbers and clustering properties .",
    "the correct number densities and clustering of these ionizing sources impact strongly the corresponding observational signatures .",
    "the ionization fronts expanding from all these millions of galaxies into the surrounding neutral igm should then be tracked with a 3d radiative transfer method and the full non - equilibrium chemistry should solved in order to derive the resulting ionization state of the igm .",
    "the combination of all these requirements makes this problem a formidable computational task .",
    "we have recently performed the largest and most detailed simulations of the formation of early cosmological large - scale structures and their radiative feedback leading to cosmic reionization .",
    "this was achieved by running extremely large , @xmath0- to @xmath1-particle ( 5.2 to 29 billion ) n - body simulations of the formation of the cosmic web , with enough particles and sufficient force resolution to resolve all the galactic halos with total masses larger than 100 million solar masses in computational volumes of @xmath2 to @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "these results were then post - processed by propagating the ionizing radiation from all ( up to millions of ) sources by using fast and accurate ray - tracing radiative transfer method . for these simulations",
    ", we utilized a p@xmath4 m n - body code called cubep@xmath4 m and a radiative transfer code called c@xmath5-ray , both developed by us .",
    "our original simulations of the same process @xcite resolved the formation of all galaxies more massive than about one billion solar masses , those which are expected to form stars even after reionization has heated their environment . with this new generation of simulations we explore the role of less massive dwarf galaxies .",
    "these are important sources of ionizing radiation if they form before their neighborhood is reionized but are prevented from being sources if they form after it is reionized .",
    "our preliminary results show that the inclusion of these sources and of their suppression changes the outcome of reionization substantially .",
    "cubep@xmath4 m is a massively - parallel p@xmath4 m ( particle - particle - particle - mesh ) @xcite cosmological n - body code written in fortran 90 .",
    "it is a successor of the code pmfast @xcite and shares many of its basic characteristics , particularly regarding the treatment of long - range ( pm ) gravitational forces .",
    "here we briefly describe the code , focusing on the new elements which distinguish it from its predecessor and have not been previously discussed .",
    "the main new features are :    * massive parallelization and scalability to thousands of nodes , using ( cubical ) domain decomposition . * inclusion of short - range direct particle - particle ( pp ) forces .",
    "the code uses the fftw 2.1.5 library and mpi-1 , as well as ( optional ) openmp threading within each node in order to optimize the memory usage by reducing the amount of buffers necessary for the domain decomposition .",
    "cubep@xmath4 m contains two mesh levels , a coarse and a fine mesh .",
    "the mesh sizes per dimension are 2x the number of particles ( fine mesh ) and half the number of particles ( coarse mesh ) .",
    "the superposition of the forces produced by each of these mesh levels , as well as the local particle - particle force , produces the total force on a particle in a given iteration of the code .",
    "the computational domain is decomposed into equal - size cubical sub - regions , which are distributed across the nodes , with a 24-cell shared buffer zone around each domain . as a consequence of this decomposition cubep@xmath4",
    "m must be run on an integer - cubed number of mpi nodes .",
    "each cuboid corresponds to the local section of the mesh , which is calculated in parallel by all nodes during each timestep .",
    "since the coarse mesh is 4 times coarser per dimension than the fine mesh ( which can be considered as the equivalent 1-level particle - mesh resolution ) , the total parallel workload is 64x less than the fine mesh simulation volume and does not suffer the performance bottleneck of having to calculate massive distributed ffts .",
    "each nodal cuboid is then decomposed into a number of fine mesh cuboid tiles for calculating the fine mesh forces .",
    "this is done to provide distinct work units for each of the threads on a node to process in parallel through multi - threading , as well as to decrease the amount of memory used to store the arrays associated with the fine mesh gravitational calculation .",
    "we note that our approach of splitting the computational volume into equal - size sub - domains , can in principle result in a work imbalance between nodes and thus diminished efficiency .",
    "however , for cosmological simulations of a sufficiently large volume of the universe this does not pose significant problems , as in practice the variations of particle numbers between the ( relatively large ) sub - volumes are fairly small .",
    "the same would not be true for e.g. detailed simulations of a single dark matter halo .",
    "we have thus geared the code to the problem at hand , rather than trying to be universal .",
    "initial conditions are generated by a separate code using the standard zeldovich approximation and primordial power spectrum transfer function given by either the cmbfast or camb bolzmann code ( both publicly available ) .",
    "the main code is then started , with the following algorithmic steps :    * calculate the timestep for the current iteration , constraining it based on expansion ( using the friedmann equation ) and the maximum acceleration components from the previous timestep .",
    "* update the particle positions using the leapfrog method in half - timestep increments .",
    "we actually merge the update from the second half of the previous step with the first half of the current step , as the velocities of the particles do not change * construct a linked list for particles within the local volume based on their location within the coarse mesh .",
    "this dramatically speeds up the particle searches which are used in the following steps .",
    "* pass particles amongst nodes .",
    "particles that move outside of the local physical volume are passed to adjacent nodes , as well as copies of local particles that are required to construct buffer densities .",
    "each dimension is treated independently and done synchronously , reducing the number of communication messages to 6 from a possible 26 neighbors . as each pass",
    "is done the particles are added to the linked list . *",
    "calculate fine mesh accelerations and apply to all particles in the same fashion as pmfast @xcite .",
    "* calculate the particle - particle forces between particles within a fine - mesh grid cell and use the resulting acceleration to update their velocities . *",
    "calculate the coarse mesh ( long - range ) accelerations and apply these to all particles in the same fashion as pmfast .",
    "as we use fftw @xcite , which only includes a 1-dimensional ( slab ) decomposition mpi fft implementation , we have written a wrapper layer that efficiently re - distributes the 3-dimensional ( cubical ) decomposition data to and from slab decomposition to perform the fourier space convolution .",
    "* update the particle positions at the end of the timestep and optionally checkpoint , calculate a density projection , or find halos .",
    "there are also options to output the coarse - mesh density , bulk velocity fields , and gas clumping for use in radiative - transfer simulations and to compare with observational predictions . *",
    "if we have reached the final redshift the simulation ends , otherwise we delete particles outside of physical volume and repeat these steps .         -0.5",
    "cm    the particle - particle force resolution at sub - grid distances is achieved by including approximate direct particle - particle interactions , as follows .",
    "an ngp ( nearest grid point ) force kernel is used to calculate the fine mesh force .",
    "this kernel has the property that forces amongst particles within a grid cell are zero , and thus provides the simplest method by which to match the particle - particle forces with the fine mesh forces .",
    "we calculate an additional pp force during fine mesh force velocity update , which allows us to avoid loading the particle list twice and also to thread the operation without any significant additional work .",
    "in this routine , all of the particles within a fine mesh tile are read in via the linked list and the appropriate force is applied depending on where they exist within the fine mesh tile .",
    "as the linked list chains particles within a coarse mesh cell , for the particle - particle interaction we proceed by constructing a set of fine - cell linked list chains for each coarse cell .",
    "we then proceed by calculating the particle - particle force between all particles within a fine mesh cell , limiting pairs to those exceeding a particular softening length ( usually set to a twentieth of the initial inter - particle spacing ) to prevent scattering .",
    "as this proceeds , we also accumulate the pp force applied to each particle and then determine the maximum force applied to a particular particle , which is then used to constrain the length of the global timestep .",
    "the biggest problem with this method is that it is anisotropic and depends on the location of the fine mesh with respect to the particles .",
    "an example are two particles on either side of a grid cell boundary",
    ". these particles will experience the 1-grid cell separation ngp mesh force , but if the mesh were shifted such that they were within the same cell , they would experience a larger force .",
    "we assume that on average this balances out , and we have even tuned the ngp force kernel to provide as unbalanced of a force as possible at grid cell distances by running large numbers of pairwise force comparisons at different separations and positions relative to the mesh .",
    "this effect is even more pronounced at the initial stages of the simulation where the density is more homogeneous , and leads to mesh artifacts appearing in the density field . in order to minimize this effect we have taken to shifting the particle distribution relative to the mesh by a small random amount , up to 2 fine grid cells in magnitude , in each dimension , at each timestep .",
    "this adds negligible computational overhead as it can be applied during the particle position update and suppresses this behavior over multiple timesteps .    in the interest of speed and efficiency",
    "the halo catalogues are constructed on - the - fly at a pre - determined list of redshifts .",
    "we use a spherical over - density ( so ) halo finder based on the density distribution on the fine mesh @xcite .",
    "the code first builds the fine - mesh density for each tile .",
    "it then proceeds to find and record all local density maxima within the physical volume ( excluding buffers ) for the tile .",
    "it then uses parabolic interpolation on the density field to determine the location of the maximum within the cell , and records the peak position and value .",
    "once the list of maxima is generated they are sorted from highest to lowest .",
    "then each of the halo candidates is inspected independently starting with the highest peak .",
    "the grid mass is accumulated in shells surrounding the maximum until the average density of the halo drops below a pre - defined overdensity cutoff ( usually set to 178 , in accordance with the top - hat collapse model ) .",
    "as we accumulate mass we remove it from the mesh , so that no mass is double - counted .",
    "this method is inappropriate for finding sub - halos as those are naturally incorporated in their host halos . after this stage",
    "we do another pass through the halo list , this time using the mass measured above to determine the radius of the halo and finding all particles which are within this radius .",
    "those are then used to calculate the halo bulk velocity , internal velocity dispersion and angular momentum components , all of which are listed in the final halo catalogues .",
    "c@xmath5-ray ( conservative causal ray - tracing ) is a grid - based ray - tracing radiative transfer and non - equilibrium chemistry code .",
    "the method and our algorithm were described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the code is explicitly photon - conserving in both space and time , which ensures correct tracking of ionization fronts without loss of accuracy independent of the spatial and time resolution , with corresponding great gains in efficiency .",
    "the code has been tested in detail against a number of exact analytical solutions @xcite , as well as in direct comparison with a number of other independent radiative transfer methods on a standardized set of benchmark problems @xcite .",
    "there is also a version of the code which is directly coupled to hydrodynamics evolution @xcite .",
    "the ionizing radiation is ray - traced from every source to every grid cell using a short characteristics method , in which the neutral column density up to a given cell is given by interpolation of the column densities of the previous cells towards the source , in addition to the neutral column density through the cell itself .",
    "the contribution of each source to the local photoionization rate of a given cell is first calculated independently , after which all contributions are added together and then non - equilibrium chemistry solver is used to calculate the resulting ionization state . normally multiple sources contribute to a local photoionization rate .",
    "changes in the rate modify the neutral fraction and thus the neutral column density , which in turn changes the photoionization rates themselves ( since either more or less radiation reaches the cell ) . an iteration procedure is thus called for in order to converge to the correct , self - consistent solution .",
    "the previous version of the code has been used for simulations of cosmic reionization and its observability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and radiative feedback in turbulent molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "while our basic methodology remains essentially as described in @xcite , recently the c@xmath5-ray has been thoroughly re - written in fortran 90 , made more flexible and modular and parallelized for distributed - memory machines . in terms of parallelization strategy , due to the causal nature of the ray - tracing procedure ( i.e.",
    "the state of each cell can be calculated only after all previous cells towards the source are done ) it is not possible to employ domain decomposition ( except for a limited one , into octants , see below ) , although other approaches exist which seek ways to overcome this limitation .",
    "instead , the main code loop over the sources of ionizing radiation is done in massively parallel fashion .",
    "each mpi node has a copy of the density field and receives a number of sources whose radiation to trace through the grid .",
    "the sources can be distributed over the nodes either statically , or dynamically , using a master - slave approach , whereby one node distributes the work amongst the rest .",
    "the static allocation is preferable for relatively small number of nodes ( up to @xmath732 ) , while the dynamical approach is better for larger systems .",
    "as long as the total number of sources is significantly larger than the number of mpi nodes such parallelization is very efficient . for the large - scale cosmological reionization problem",
    "there are typically hundreds of thousands to millions of sources , thus our code scales well up to tens of thousands of cores ( see next section ) . for problems with a ( relatively ) low number of ionizing sources",
    "such a parallelization strategy would be inefficient , but such problems are not sufficiently computationally - intensive to require massive parallelization and could , instead , be solved on a smaller number of nodes , or even in serial .",
    "a similar situation occurs for the initial steps of the simulations presented below , when the cosmological structure formation is not yet much advanced , thus only a few to tens of halos form . however , their number increases exponentially with time , quickly reaching thousands , and then tens and hundreds of thousands .",
    "we therefore start our simulations on a small number of cores ( typically 32 ) , and increase this number as more sources form .",
    "since the current version of the code requires that a complete copy of the grid is available on each node , it has relatively high memory - per - node requirements .",
    "e.g. a @xmath8 mesh requires @xmath9  gb per node to run .",
    "therefore , ranger , with its large amounts of ram available per node is a perfect platform for high - resolution radiative transfer runs .    as mentioned above , a limited domain decomposition into octants is possible for our method , since those are independent of each other within the short - characteristic ray - tracing framework .",
    "we use this to ( optionally ) improve the memory efficiency of the code by doing the grid octants in parallel within each mpi node using openmp multi - threading . this way each mpi node needs only one copy of the grid , which is shared amongst the cores within the node .",
    "we have conducted a series of n - body structure formation simulations , with particle numbers of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath0 , @xmath12 and @xmath1 and box sizes of 53  mpc , 80  mpc , 91  mpc , 103  mpc and 163  mpc , respectively . at earlier times",
    "the physical volume will be smaller by a factor @xmath13 .",
    "the last in this series is the largest simulation of the formation of early cosmological structures done to date . the @xmath11 and @xmath0-particle simulations were ran on the dell linux cluster ( lonestar ) at tacc on 500 and 432 cores , respectively , while the @xmath14 and @xmath1 were ran on the newly - deployed sun constellation linux cluster ( ranger ) at tacc , on 256 , 2048 and 2048 cores , respectively .",
    "the latter three simulations were ran with 4 mpi processes and 4 threads per node ( using the _ tacc_affinity _ script to ensure local memory affinity ) and required 4,100 , 40,000 and 159,000 sus ( cores @xmath15 hours ) .",
    "all simulations use the same particle mass , @xmath16 .",
    "this mass resolution allows us to resolve , with 20 particles or better , all halos with a mass above @xmath6 .",
    "this mass roughly corresponds to a halo virial temperature of @xmath17  k , and thus is the minimum halo mass for the gas in the halo to be able to cool through hydrogen atomic - line cooling and efficiently form stars .",
    "gas in halos smaller than that can only cool through molecular , as well as metal - line cooling , which is less efficient since molecules get destroyed relatively easily , while metals ( elements heavier than he ) are not present in significant amounts so early in the history of the universe .",
    "the halos are divided further into halos with mass above the jeans mass of the ionized and heated medium ( roughly above @xmath18 ) , which are not affected by reionization and lower - mass halos , whose star formation is suppressed in ionized regions .     from the n - body simulations with box sizes 91  mpc ( blue triangles ) , 103  mpc ( green squares ) and 163  mpc ( red circles ) .",
    "all three mass functions demonstrate excellent agreement , except for the largest halos which are subject to cosmic variance for the smaller volume simulations .",
    "the lines show the predicted mass functions based on the well - known analytical models of press - schechter ( @xcite ; dotted ) and sheth - tormen ( @xcite ; dashed ) .",

    "our methodology for these simulations is described in detail in @xcite . in short , all halos",
    "are assumed to host galaxies ( thus , ionizing sources ) , to which we assign ionizing photon luminosity proportional to the halo mass , with an efficiency @xmath19 , giving the number of photons emitted per atom over the lifetime of the source ( here assumed to be 11.5 myr ) .",
    "the simulations are denoted f100_250s_91mpc_216 , f100_250s_91mpc_432 and f50_250s_163mpc_384 , where the first two numbers are the values of @xmath19 for the high- and low - mass sources ( `` s '' is for source suppression due to jeans - mass filtering , the third is the box size and the last is the radiative transfer grid resolution per dimension .",
    "the first two simulations are currently finished , while the last ( and largest ) is still running .",
    "all three simulations ran on ranger with 4 mpi processes and 4 threads per node and took approximately 90,000 , 700,000 and ( to date ) 500,000 sus , respectively .",

    "this weak scaling requirement is dictated by the problems we are trying to solve ( very large and computationally - intensive ) and our aims , which are to do such large problems efficiently , rather than for the least wall - clock time .",

    "the code scaling from 256 to 2048 cores and @xmath10 to @xmath12 particles is excellent , within 20% of the perfect one ( dashed line ) .",
    "we expect that this small difference is mostly due to the larger communication overhead for the larger simulation .",
    "the largest simulation ( @xmath1 particles on 2048 cores ) differs from the perfect scaling by approximately 40% , demonstrating the strong effect of the communication and i / o overheads ( since the number of cores for the @xmath12 and @xmath1 simulations is the same , the only difference is the larger amount of data that has to be communicated and read / written ) .",
    "the code performance is thus quite satisfactory and it could be expected to scale well to even larger number of cores .",

    "on 10,000 cores , scales slightly worse , partly due to the same grid effect , but in reverse ( the grid is @xmath25 vs. @xmath8 ) , and partly due to the higher communication overhead in this case .",

    "[ sourcenum_fcoll ] we show the evolution of the total source numbers , active source numbers and collapsed fractions ( i.e. the fraction of the total mass found in sources ) for the two types of sources .",
    "the collapsed fractions from the two simulations agree to within a few percent ( relative ) and the halo numbers show a similar agreement ( once the different simulation volumes are taken into account ) .",
    "the biggest difference is found at very early times , when only a few , rare sources have formed , which are subject to strong cosmic variance . e.g.  for the 163  mpc box the first halos form already at redshift @xmath26 , while for 91  mpc the first sources only form at @xmath27 , due to the 5.6 times smaller volume which is simulated and , more subtly , due to the inevitable cutoff at the box size of longest - wavelength density perturbation modes , which changes the statistics and bias of the rarest halos .    finally , in fig .  [ images ] we show some images of the density field and ( active ) source distribution overlayed with the ionized fraction derived from our radiative transfer simulations .",
    "these indicate the very complex and evolving geometry and topology of the network of ionized bubbles and neutral patches , which needs to be studied in detail in order to make predictions for the many observational experiments aiming to detect these remote epochs .",
    "we have planned and are working on a number of improvements of the codes and the simulations presented here .",
    "a very important development will be to directly couple the cubep@xmath4 m and c@xmath5-ray codes , which will allow us to run simulations of the feedback of radiation on the gas in the forming cosmic structures .",
    "such feedback is particularly important at small spatial scales and can modify significantly the forming structures , with corresponding observational implications .",
    "there are some significant issues to overcome in terms of the efficient parallelization of such coupled code , due to the very different approaches currently employed for their parallelization , discussed above .",
    "an improvement for cubep@xmath4 m would be extending the accuracy of the n - body pp force resolution to multi - grid cell distances .",
    "this would dramatically improve the force resolution and further minimize the force anisotropy by allowing the matching to take place at larger separations where the magnitude of the gravitational force is weaker . while this would slow down the calculation",
    ", it would help to improve the code efficiency ( by increasing the number of calculations while keeping the same amount of communication ) .",
    "we are also working on improving our halo finding procedure .",
    "the current grid - based scheme works quite well for finding and determining the properties of the larger halos ( containing 40 - 50 particles or more ) , but is somewhat less precise for the smallest halos ( down to 20 particles ) .",
    "our new halo finding method will be independent of the grid and thus more reliable for identifying the smallest halos .",
    "finally , we also plan to run much larger n - body simulations , with somewhat different scientific goals .",

    "it is entirely within the machine and code specifications to run simulations with up to 165 billion particles ( on 10,976 cores ) in the near future .",
    "even simulations with over 300 billion particles are in principle possible , provided some current technical issues are resolved .",
    "such extremely large structure formation simulations will be of great value for galaxy survey science since it becomes possible to simulate the whole observable universe ( @xmath29gpc)@xmath4 volume ) in a single simulation with sufficient resolution to identify the typical galaxies seen in large surveys ( with luminosity @xmath30 , roughly similar to our milky way galaxy , or less ) .",

    "<S> both codes are parallelized using a combination of mpi and openmp and to this date have been run efficiently on up to 2048 cores ( cubep@xmath4 m ) and up to 10000 cores ( c@xmath5-ray ) on the newly - deployed sun constellation linux cluster ( ranger ) at the texas advanced computing center .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we briefly present our codes , methods and parallelization strategies , discuss our recent simulations and results and outline our future plans . </S>"
