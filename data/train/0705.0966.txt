    "ngc  2419 is one of the most distant and luminous globular clusters ( gcs ) in the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "although both the distance ( @xmath12 @xmath13 90 kpc , @xcite ) and the dynamical parameters ( core radius @xmath14 pc , and half - mass radius @xmath15 19 pc , @xcite ) put ngc  2419 among the outer halo galactic globulars , the cluster has several unusual properties for an outer halo gc .",
    "it is much more luminous and metal - poor than the other outer halo clusters : with @xmath16 mag ( @xcite ) ngc  2419 is among the five brightest clusters in the mw ; and with [ fe / h]@xmath172.1 dex ( @xcite ) it belongs to the most metal - poor group of mw gcs that all , except am-4 , are located within @xmath12 @xmath13 20 kpc .",
    "the cluster horizontal branch ( hb ) also resembles that of much closer `` canonical '' metal - poor clusters like m15 or m68 , and previous investigations show that ngc  2419 has the same age of m92 , within 1 gyr @xcite .",
    "however , ngc  2419 is not an inner halo cluster migrated out on an elliptical orbit , since its dynamical parameters and orbital properties ( @xcite , and references therein ) are typical of an outer halo cluster .",
    "ngc  2419 is also anomalous in the half - light radius ( @xmath18 ) vs @xmath19 plane ( see fig .  11 of @xcite ) . among the mw gcs",
    "only @xmath20 cen and m54 have similar properties in this plane , and they both are `` peculiar '' , since @xmath20 cen hosts multiple stellar populations ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and likely is the stripped core of a defunct dwarf galaxy ( @xcite , and references therein ) ; and m54 is thought to be the core of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( dsph ) that is currently merging with the mw ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "all these peculiarities and the similarity with @xmath20 cen and m54 suggest that ngc  2419 could have an extragalactic origin and be the relict of a dwarf galaxy tidally disrupted by the mw @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the cluster appears to lie within an overdensity of a - type stars connected to previously discovered tidal tails of the sgr dsph , and conclude that the cluster might once have been associated to sgr .",
    "in addition , the cluster has a central velocity dispersion ( @xmath21 ) much lower than the dsphs for which this quantity has been measured , and , in the @xmath22 vs @xmath19 plane ( @xcite ) , lies 3 and 6@xmath7 apart from the  fundamental plane \" relations for gcs and elliptical galaxies , respectively ( see @xcite ) . for a comparison , in this plane",
    "@xmath20 cen lies at the intersection of these two lines .",
    "color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of ngc  2419 published so far either do not go fainter than the main sequence turn - off ( to ) or cover small portions of the cluster ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we also lack a modern study of the cluster variable stars based on accurate ccd photometry , the most recent variability survey being the photographic work by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter pr ) who detected 41 variables in the external regions of ngc  2419 and found the average period of the fundamental - mode rr lyrae stars ( rrab ) to be consistent with ngc  2419 being an oosterhoff ii ( ooii ) cluster ( @xcite ) .    in this letter",
    "we present a cmd reaching about 2.6 mag below the ngc  2419 to and a new study of the variable stars based on image subtraction techniques ( @xcite ) , using @xmath1 time - series ccd photometry covering an area that extends well beyond the cluster published tidal radius ( @xmath23 , according to @xcite ) .",
    "the new data are used to verify whether multiple stellar populations and tidal tails exist in the cluster and to check whether the properties of the rr lyrae stars support an extragalactic origin for ngc  2419 .",
    "time - series @xmath24 photometry of ngc  2419 ( ra=07:38:24.0 , dec=38:54:00 , j2000 ) was collected between 2003 september and 2004 february with dolores at the 3.5 m tng telescope .",
    "the tng data were complemented by wfpc2@hst f555w and f814w archival photometry spanning 7 years from 1994 to 2000 , and by @xmath25 images of the cluster obtained with the suprime - cam of the subaru 8.2 m telescope along four nights in 2002 .",
    "the subaru dataset covers a total area of 50 @xmath26 43 arcmin@xmath27 centered on ngc  2419 and includes both the tng and hst fields .",
    "results presented in this letter refer to a region extending @xmath28 in north - south and @xmath29 in east - west from the cluster center .",
    "the total number of phase points of the combined datasets reaches 20 , 205 and 48 in the @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 bands , respectively , with optimal sampling of the @xmath31 light curves of rr lyrae stars , acceptable coverage in @xmath30 , and rather poor sampling in @xmath32 , since the @xmath32-band images were taken much more closely spaced in time .",
    "images were pre - reduced following standard techniques ( bias subtraction and flat - field correction ) with iraf .",
    "we measured the star magnitudes by psf photometry running the daophotii / allstar / allframe packages @xcite on the tng , hst and subaru datasets , separately .",
    "typical internal errors of the @xmath31 band photometry for single phase points at the level of the hb are in the range from 0.01 to 0.02 mag .",
    "the absolute photometric calibration was obtained by using local standards in ngc  2419 from p.b .",

    "zero point uncertainties are of 0.022 , 0.014 and 0.014 mag in @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "further details on the data reductions can be found in di criscienzo et al .",
    "( 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "candidate variable stars were identified using two independent methods : the optimal image subtraction technique and the package isis 2.1 ( @xcite ) , applied to the tng @xmath31 time - series ; and an ad hoc procedure applied to the subaru @xmath31 data that included calculation of the fourier transform ( in the @xcite formulation ) for each star with more than 25 epoch data ; evaluation of the signal - to - noise ratio and then analysis of the stars with s / n @xmath33 6 and magnitude @xmath34 23.7 mag ( excluding to and sub giant branch stars ) .",
    "the two procedures returned a catalogue of 101 confirmed variables .",
    "periods ( and type classification ) were derived using gratis ( graphical analyzer of time series ) , a custom software developed at the bologna observatory ( see @xcite ) .",
    "precision of the period determinations is of 4 - 5 decimal places ( for variables with periods shorter than 2 d , 95 objects ) and increases up to 6 digits for stars with the three datasets ( tng , hst and subaru ) available .",
    "the good sampling of the @xmath31 light curves allowed a very accurate definition of the star s visual mean magnitudes and amplitudes .",
    "coverage of the @xmath30 and @xmath32 light curves is generally much poorer , and we often estimated average @xmath30 and @xmath32 magnitudes by scaling down in amplitude the star @xmath31 light curve to fit observations in the other bands ( see di criscienzo et al .",

    "panel ( d ) shows the cmd of an external field devoid of cluster stars with same area as the cluster region in panel ( a ) and thus provides an indication of the contamination by field stars in panel ( a ) .",
    "pr identified 41 variable stars in their photographic study of ngc  2419 : 25 _ ab- _ and 7 _ c-_type rr lyrae stars , 1 population ii cepheid , 4 red irregular / semiregular variables , and further 4 variables for which they did not provide period and classification .",
    "pr v39 was later recognized as double - mode rr lyrae star @xcite .",
    "we recovered and derived reliable periods for all the previously known variable stars in ngc  2419 , and detected 60 new variables that are mainly located in the cluster central regions .",
    "the new variables include : 11 @xmath46 and 28 @xmath47type rr lyrae stars , 12 sx phoenicis stars , 3 binaries , 1 long period variable ( lpv ) near the red giant tip , 2 field @xmath42 scuti stars , and 3 variables of unknown type .",
    "light curves for different types of variables are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the high performance of the image subtraction to detecting small amplitude variables in very crowded fields allowed us the discovery of a remarkably large number ( 28 objects ) of _ c-_type rr lyrae stars increasing fivefold the statistics of the rrc stars previously known in ngc  2419 .",
    "most of the new rrc s as well as the new rrab stars with longer periods were missed by pr due to their small amplitude and the location towards the cluster center .",
    "addition of the new discoveries , brings the number of rr lyrae stars in ngc  2419 to 38 rrab , 36 rrc and 1 rrd star , and changes the ratio of number of rrc over number of rrc+rrab stars from 0.28 ( pr ) to 0.49 , in much better agreement with typical values of the ooii clusters .",
    "we also revise the cluster hb morphology parameter hbr ( @xcite , and reference therein ) from 0.86 ( @xcite ) , to about 0.76 ( after decontamination by field stars , see di criscienzo et al .",
    "average periods are : @xmath2=0.662 d ( @xmath7=0.055 , average on 38 stars ) , and @xmath3=0.366 d , ( @xmath7=0.038 , average on 36 stars ) , for fundamental - mode and first - overtone rr lyrae stars , respectively , to compare with @xmath48=0.654 d and @xmath3=0.384 d from pr . the new values confirm and strengthen the classification of ngc  2419 as ooii cluster",
    ". the minimum period of the rrab stars , @xmath49=0.576 d ( star v40 , for which pr could not derive period information ) , is in perfect agreement with values of prototype ooii clusters like m15 and m68 .",

    "the bulk of rrab variables lies in the region occupied by the ooii ggcs ( dot - dashed line , from @xcite ) , confirming the ooii nature of ngc  2419 , the few stars between oo i and ii lines being entirely accounted for by crowded objects and possible undetected blazkho variables ( @xcite ; see discussion in di criscienzo et al .",

    "the average apparent magnitude of the ngc  2419 rr lyrae stars is @xmath50 = 20.31@xmath6 ( @xmath7=0.06 , average on 67 stars ) excluding objects contaminated by companions .",
    "this value , combined with the cluster metallicity ( [ fe / h]=@xmath42.1 dex , @xcite ) and reddening , is used to estimate the cluster distance .",
    "@xcite reports @xmath51 mag ( from the average of various sources ) , while a lower value @xmath52 is derived on the basis of the @xcite maps .",

    "ngc  2419 hosts many blue straggler stars ( bss ) . among them",
    "we detected 1 binary system and 12 pulsating variables with periods in the range from 0.041 to 0.140 d and several secondary periodicities .",
    "they are likely cluster sx phoenicis stars ( see di criscienzo et al .",

    "fig .  [ fig:1 ] shows that the bulk of the ngc  2419 stars and variables is within @xmath61 4.5@xmath38 from the center ( panel _ a _ ) .",
    "cluster stars are found beyond the published tidal radius ( 8.74@xmath38 , @xcite ) until @xmath62 ( see panel _ b _ ) and possibly as far as @xmath60 . the cmd appears to be dominated by field stars and contaminating galaxies for @xmath63 .",
    "the main features of the ngc  2419 cmd are ( panels _ a , b _ ) : a well defined main - sequence reaching about 2.6 mag below the cluster to at @xmath64 23.4 mag , with no clear evidence of multiple substructures . the red giant branch ( rgb )",
    "is narrow , ruling out significant differences in composition among cluster stars .",
    "the hb is well populated to the blue and has very few stars redder than the rr lyrae .",
    "most striking features are the well defined bss sequence outlined by many sx phoenicis stars , and the extremely prolonged hb blue tail , extending down to @xmath64 24.7 mag , ( i.e. @xmath65 ) with a gap between @xmath64 23.4 and 23.8 mag .",
    "this group of extremely hot stars , can not be fitted by theoretical models of extreme hb stars ( e.g. @xcite post - helium flash theoretical models for the proper composition of ngc 2419 ) since  blue - hook \" stars experience the helium flash after leaving the rgb .",
    "first detected by @xcite and @xcite in their analysis of the @xmath20cen hb , `` blue - hook '' stars have been found so far only in very few ggcs ( @xmath20 cen , m54 , ngc 2808 , ngc6388 , ngc6273 , see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the results presented in this letter provide some constraints on the hypotheses put forward for the origin of ngc  2419 .",
    "the finding that the cluster confirms to be of ooii type , like `` normal '' low metallicity ggcs as m15 and m68 , makes its extra - galactic origin unlikely , since gcs in external galaxies generally have properties intermediate between ooi and ii types ( @xcite ) . the lack of multiple populations or metallicity spreads does not corroborate the hypothesis that ngc  2419 might be the core of a defunct galaxy either .",
    "in addition , no cluster extra - tidal structures are clearly seen in our data beyond @xmath66 to support @xcite suggestion of a past association with the sgr dsph , a claim also disfavored by the sgr field and cluster ( m54 ) rr lyrae stars having properties on the long - period tail of the ooi group and intermediate between oo types , respectively ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . from our data",
    "ngc  2419 appears indeed a very normal , low metallicity galactic gc , the only exception being the hb `` blue - hook '' , a feature detected so far only in very few globulars and , most noteworthy , in those showing multiple main sequences and/or of likely extragalactic origin : ngc  2808 ( @xcite ) ; @xmath20 cen ( @xcite ) ; and m54 ( @xcite ) .",
