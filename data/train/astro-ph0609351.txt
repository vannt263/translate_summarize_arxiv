    "multiscaling analysis techniques dealing with the analysis / synthesis of nd - images defined on intervals of @xmath0 have been applied in many fields of physics in the last 15 years .",
    "for instance , in the case @xmath1 one has electronics and audio signals , in the case @xmath2 one has optical or infrared images whereas for @xmath3 one deals with fluid dynamics or the large - scale structure of the universe as 3d - images .",
    "however , there are data given on other manifolds like the circle @xmath4 ( e. g. scanning along circles the microwave sky ) and the sphere @xmath5 ( e. g. geophysics ) . in this paper",
    ", we are interested in data distributed on the sphere .",
    "trivially , for the study of local properties ( e. g. detection of objects ) one can project on the tangent plane at any point on the sphere to make this type of analysis but when global properties are taken into account the curvature of the sphere can not be neglected .",
    "a first approach to deal with these global properties is to make some global projection of all the points of the sphere .",
    "the stereographic projection has been recently used dealing with the continuous wavelet transform . in this case , to get the wavelet coefficient at any point on the sphere , one projects from the opposite point to the local tangent plane . [ 1 ] have made a connection to group theory .",
    "the translations and dilations in the wavelet have their definition on the plane .",
    "clearly , such a projection does not take into account the topological structure of the sphere .",
    "some applications to cosmology , in particular the study of anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background radiation have been done by some authors ( [ 3],[7],[10 ] ) using the projection of the _ mexican hat wavelet_. a drawback of such projection is the obvious deformation of the pixels and wavelets near the projection pole .",
    "we remark that the synthesis can be done in terms of another biorthogonal wavelet [ 11 ] .",
    "another approach uses some analyzing wavelet functions that are defined in terms of spherical harmonics [ 5 ] with a definition of the dilation operator and conditions on the wavelets in such a way to get a synthesis formula .",
    "the drawback of such methodology is : the dilations do not satisfy the appropriate flat limit in general .",
    "also some examples of wavelet functions are poorly localized ( e. g. abel - poison wavelets ) .",
    "a different approach assumes from the beginning discrete wavelets incorporating tensor product approaches in polar coordinates , then the two poles are singular points regarding approximation / stability properties ( [ 4],[6 ] ) .",
    "another approach is adapted to arbitrary point systems or triangulations on the spheres , then there is no efficient tool as fast wavelet algorithms . in the approach by [ 8 ] basis",
    "are defined on a quasi - uniform icosahedral triangulation on the sphere allowing for a fast algorithm .",
    "however , biorthogonal wavelets are needed and a lifting scheme for the multiresolution is applied avoiding the concepts of translations and dilations and also it is not clear whether the construction leads to a stable @xmath6 basis .",
    "haar - type wavelets have been developed using different pixel combinations ( [ 2],[7],[9 ] ) .",
    "the first case uses the lifting scheme weighting for the area of the pixels whereas in the other two cases an equal area pixelization is used but the haar - type transform is only applied on regions of the sphere covering only @xmath7 of the total area .",
    "clearly , with any pixelization the symmetry on the sphere is lost .    in this paper",
    "we will consider a continuous approach , we will introduce a methodology that incorporates the analysis and synthesis of any function defined on the sphere @xmath5 using the same circularly - symmetric wavelet and also we will introduce the generalization of the translations / dilations . in this sense",
    "we follow freeden s approach working with spherical harmonics .",
    "examples will be given that have the appropriate flat limit .",
    "finally , the application to the detection of a spot is given , studying the concentration of the wavelet coefficients .",
    "we will consider a circularly - symmetric filter defined on the sphere @xmath8    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is a fixed direction .",
    "@xmath11 is another fixed , but arbitrary direction , therefore @xmath12 will represent a rotation on the sphere with respect to the direction @xmath10 defined by the angle @xmath13 ( @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 will represent a dilation , which will be defined later on through the spherical harmonics .",
    "we assume the following properties of the filter :    \\(i ) the analysis of any function @xmath16 will be done with the wavelets @xmath17 ,    \\(ii ) the synthesis of any function @xmath16 will be done with the wavelets coefficients and the wavelets @xmath18 ,    \\(iii ) it will incorporate the definition of translation and dilation on the sphere .",
    "we remark that no assumption about compensation of the filter ( i. e. @xmath19 ) and projection from @xmath20 to @xmath5 is imposed .",
    "we define the wavelet coefficients associated to the translation @xmath11 and dilation @xmath22 for the function @xmath16 defined on @xmath5 @xmath23 let us assume the standard decomposition of @xmath16 in spherical harmonics @xmath24 @xmath25 by introducing eq.([eq : ce ] ) into eq.([eq : cd ] ) and taking into account that @xmath24 is an orthonormal base of @xmath5 , we obtain @xmath26 where the legendre coefficients associated to the circularly - symmetric filter @xmath21 are given by @xmath27",
    "now , let us show that in order to have a reconstruction equation , i. e. @xmath16 as a functional integral of the wavelet coefficients and the wavelet base @xmath21 one can impose the condition @xmath28 i. e. @xmath29 depends on the product @xmath30 and @xmath31 satisfies the admissibility condition @xmath32 where @xmath33 runs in the interval @xmath34 .",
    "we remark that the analogous condition to have a reconstruction on the plane by substituting @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the wave number in fourier space .",
    "therefore , the filter @xmath21 -given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cg])- can be rewritten as @xmath37 firstly , we remark that the previous equation defines a dilation on the sphere in terms of dilation of the number @xmath33 and a translation on the sphere in terms of a rotation through the spherical harmonics @xmath38 .",
    "we think that such a definition is the most natural on the sphere and generalizes the one associated to dilations and translations in the plane @xmath20 via fourier space .",
    "secondly , we can write the following equation @xmath39 ,   \\label{eq : cj}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have taken the harmonic expansions for @xmath40 and @xmath17 .",
    "if one wants to have this equation proportional to @xmath41 , i.e. to be able to reconstruct @xmath16 , then it is obvious that necessarily @xmath42 where @xmath43 must be a constant . a particular solution to the previous equation is given by eq .",
    "[ eq : ch ] and the admissibility condition . in this case",
    ", the synthesis equation can be written as @xmath44 and the equation ( [ eq : cf ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath45 these equations are the analysis / synthesis counterparts on @xmath5 of the corresponding ones on @xmath20 .",
    "let us focus on some of the properties of the filter :    * @xmath21 is a _",
    "compensated _ filter *    taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq : cl ] ) , @xmath46 implies that @xmath47 as @xmath48 , i. e. @xmath49 .",
    "now , taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq : ci ] ) , one obtains @xmath50 the filter is compensated ( hereinafter wavelet ) .    * energy of the wavelet *    taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq : ci ] ) and the orthonormal property of the spherical harmonics , one obtains @xmath51    * energy of the function @xmath16 *    taking into account the standard properties of the spherical harmonics @xmath52 we can also prove the following equivalence @xmath53",
    "as an example of the previous ideas we will consider the generalization to the sphere of the _ mexican hat wavelet _ ( mhw ) .",
    "we focus on the mhw because it is a widely used tool in astronomy , well suited for the detection of pointlike objects such as extragalactic sources ( [ 3],[7],[10 ] ) , but the same ideas can be applied to other wavelet families as well .",
    "two natural generalizations of the mother mexican hat wavelet on the plane are possible @xmath54 where we have taken a unit width to define the mother wavelet . for @xmath55",
    "both functions approach the mhw on the plane .",
    "we have represented the harmonic coefficients @xmath56 for different values of @xmath57 , as well as the profile of the wavelets on real space for the same cases , in figure  [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the differences between wavelets @xmath58 and @xmath59 is shown in figure  [ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "next , in order to study the concentration in wavelet space we will consider a spot with spherical symmetry placed on the north pole , i. e. it is defined by a function @xmath60 . in this case",
    ", we get for the wavelet coefficients @xmath61 let us now consider a very simple spot defined by a top hat @xmath62}$ ] .",
    "a simple way to test how the wavelets allow us to concentrate the information in a few number of coefficients is to measure somehow the width of the curve @xmath63 of wavelet coefficients for the spot .",
    "an intuitive way to do this is to define the `` energy '' as the integral under the squared curve @xmath64 and to see which is the radius @xmath65 that contains a given fraction of the total energy .",
    "the smaller @xmath65 is , the more concentrated the coefficients are .",
    "we have performed numerical simulations with a simple toy model to see which of the two generalizations of the mhw , @xmath58 or @xmath59 , concentrates more the coefficients .",
    "we have placed a top hat spot of size @xmath66 rad in the north pole and we have filtered it with the wavelets @xmath58 and @xmath59 using different scales ranging from @xmath67 to @xmath68 rad .",
    "the results are shown in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "we have ploted the radius @xmath69 such that @xmath70 of the energy is inside the circle of radius @xmath69 as a function of the dilation scale @xmath22 .",
    "as can be seen , the wavelet @xmath58 concentrates more the coefficients , that is , produces smaller values of @xmath65 .",
    "now we repeat the same process but using a gaussian spot instead of a top hat .",
    "the gaussian spot is given by @xmath71 .",
    "this case is interesting since most of the detectors that operate in microwave astronomy experiments have approximately gaussian response .",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : fig3 ] show the results , that are very similar to the top hat case .",
    "again , @xmath58 concentrates more the coefficients .",
    "we have tested the resuts for different levels of concentration and we have found that up to @xmath72 the wavelet @xmath58 concentrates more the coefficients . above @xmath72",
    "this is still true for large values of the dilation @xmath22 , while for small @xmath22 @xmath59 concentrates more the coefficients .",
    "this is due to the fact that @xmath58 produces more small oscilations in the tail of the curve @xmath63 for small @xmath22 .",
    "we have developed a constructive wavelet approach on the sphere without any projection from the plane .",
    "it is a continuous transform that allows the analysis and synthesis of any function defined on the sphere and incorporates the concepts of translation and dilation as generalizations of the elementary ones defined on the plane .",
    "it is a compensated filter that conserves the energy of any function .",
    "we have considered some natural generalizations of the plane mexican hat wavelet and we have applied them to the detection of a big spot .",
    "the conclusion is that one of the wavelets ( @xmath58 ) concentrates more the information than the other one .",
