    "the entanglement properties of many - body systems are of great interest for both quantum information theory @xcite and condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "their knowledge enables , on the one hand , to assess the potential of a given many - body system for quantum information processing tasks such as quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum computation @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it provides a deep understanding of quantum correlations and their relation with criticality @xcite . in non - critical systems with short range couplings , i.e. , local couplings in boson or spin lattices , ground state entanglement is believed to satisfy a general area law by which the entropy of the reduced state of a given region , which measures its entanglement with the rest of the system , scales as the area of its boundary as the system size increases @xcite .",
    "this behavior is quite different from that of standard thermodynamic entropy which scales as the volume .",
    "in one dimensional systems this statement has been quite generally and rigorously proved @xcite and simply means that the entropy of a contiguous section saturates , i.e. , approaches a size independent constant , as the size increases .",
    "violation of this scaling is therefore an indication of criticality @xcite .",
    "the exact expression of the entropy of a contiguous block in a one - dimensional xy spin 1/2 chain in the thermodynamic limit has been obtained @xcite and confirms the previous behavior .",
    "the conventional area law holds for contiguous subsystems . for non - contiguous regions",
    "it actually implies that the entropy is proportional to the number of couplings broken by the partition .",
    "for instance , for _",
    "comb_-like regions like the subset of all even sites in a chain , the entropy should scale as the total number @xmath3 of sites for first neighbor or short range couplings .",
    "this was in fact verified in @xcite for the harmonic cyclic chain , where the corresponding logarithmic negativity was calculated , and also verified numerically in @xcite for some spin arrays and a @xmath4-@xmath5 half - filled hubbard model , where the even entanglement entropy was computed .",
    "an exact treatment of general comb entropies for a large one - dimensional critical xx spin @xmath6 chain with first neighbor couplings was given in @xcite , showing that they are indeed proportional to the size @xmath7 plus a logarithmic correction .",
    "the aim of this work is to analyze in detail the entanglement entropy of all even sites in _ finite _ boson and spin arrays , both in one dimension as well as in general @xmath5-dimensions .",
    "such bipartition can be normally expected to be the maximally entangled bipartition at least for uniform nearest neighbor couplings , as it will there break all coupling links .",
    "we first analyze the bosonic case with general quadratic couplings , where a fully analytic treatment of this entropy is shown to be feasible and allows to derive simple general expressions in the weak coupling limit .",
    "comparison with single site and block entropies is also made .",
    "the bosonic treatment is then applied to finite spin @xmath2 arrays with anisotropic ferromagnetic - type @xmath1 couplings in a uniform transverse field through the rpa approach @xcite .",
    "this allows to predict in a simple way the main properties of the total even entropy in these systems .",
    "comparison with exact numerical results indicate that the rpa prediction , while qualitatively correct , is also quite accurate outside the critical region already for low spin @xmath8 , representing the high spin limit .",
    "results corroborate that for strong fields , the total even entropy in these systems is extensive , i.e. , directly proportional to the total number @xmath3 of sites .",
    "however , for low fields @xmath9 , this entropy has an additive constant , which arises in the rpa from parity restoration @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the immediate vicinity of the factorizing field @xmath10 @xcite , extensivity is fully lost and the total even entropy reduces to this constant , which is the same as that for the block entropy and is exactly evaluated .",

    "<S> results for first neighbor anisotropic @xmath1 couplings indicate that while at strong magnetic fields this entropy is strictly extensive , at weak fields important deviations arise , stemming from parity - breaking effects and the presence of a factorizing field ( in which vicinity it becomes size - independent and identical to the entropy of a contiguous half ) . </S>",
