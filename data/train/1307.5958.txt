    "lattice gauge theory provides a powerful nonperturbative approach to study the phase structure and thermodynamics of a non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "presumably , the best explored till now are pure lattice gauge theories with the su(2 ) and su(3 ) color groups @xcite .",
    "recently , the equation of state of the su(3 ) gauge theory was established with an unprecedented precision in a broad parameter range within lattice approach @xcite .",
    "the results were extrapolated to the continuum and thermodynamic limit , providing definitive results on the equation of state and the value of critical temperature .",
    "the phase transition in the su(3 ) gauge theory is first order and is characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the global @xmath1 center symmetry of the yang - mills lagrangian .",
    "the polyakov loop is an order parameter which is linked to the free energy of the static quark immersed in a hot gluonic medium @xcite . at low temperatures the thermal expectation value of the polyakov loop @xmath2 vanishes , indicating color confinement . at high temperatures @xmath3 , resulting in the finite energy of a static quark , and consequently deconfinement of color and the spontaneous breaking of @xmath1 center symmetry .",
    "the transition temperature can be identified from the peak position of the polyakov loop susceptibility .    on the lattice ,",
    "the ultraviolet divergence of the bare quark - antiquark free energy implies , that in the continuum limit , the bare polyakov loop vanishes for all temperatures .",
    "thus , the polyakov loop and the related susceptibilities require renormalization to become physically meaningful @xcite . while the basic thermodynamics functions of the su(3 ) pure gauge theory are well established within lattice approach , the situation is less clear for the temperature dependence of the renormalized polyakov loop and its susceptibilities .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the renormalized polyakov loop susceptibilities . for color gauge group @xmath4 ,",
    "the polyakov loop is complex - valued .",
    "consequently , discussing the polyakov loop fluctuations one can consider susceptibilities along longitudinal and transverse direction , as well as , that of its absolute value .",
    "we calculate the temperature dependence of the polyakov loop susceptibilities within the su(3 ) lattice gauge theory .",
    "we use the symanzik improved gauge action on @xmath5 lattices for different values of the temporal lattice sizes @xmath6 and for spatial extensions @xmath7 varying from 16 to 64 .    in our recent studies",
    "@xcite , we have discussed the ratios of different susceptibilities of the polyakov loop and motivate their importance as observables to probe deconfinement transition in the su(3 ) pure gauge theory .",
    "we have shown , that the ratios of susceptibilities display a jump across the critical temperature . in this paper",
    "we extend our previous study and discuss properties of the polyakov susceptibilities in a broader temperature range .",
    "we also study the influence of dynamical quarks on different susceptibilities within lattice gauge theory .",
    "we present results based on the polyakov loop data from simulations in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd on @xmath0 lattice using the hisq action with an almost physical strange quark mass and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "we show , that the explicit breaking of the @xmath1 center symmetry in qcd , modifies the properties of the polyakov loop susceptibilities found in the pure gauge theory . the ratios are substantially smoothened but still feature interesting characteristics in connection to the deconfinement phase transition .    in the confined phase and up to near @xmath9",
    ", the thermodynamics of the su(3 ) gauge theory is well described within the hagedorn - type model , incorporating glueballs as degrees of freedom @xcite . in the deconfined phase",
    ", the perturbative approach describes the lattice data from the stefan - boltzmann limit down to @xmath10 @xcite . to quantify the equation of state near @xmath9",
    "one needs in general , an intrinsic non - perturbative description in terms of effective models .",
    "the polyakov loop is the relevant quantity to effectively describe gluo - dynamics @xcite .",
    "various models based on the polyakov loop have been proposed to quantify the deconfinement transition and thermodynamics of a pure gauge theory @xcite    we take advantage of our new data on different susceptibilities to construct an effective potential for the polyakov loop , which is consistent with all existing lattice data over a broad range of temperatures .",
    "we show , that the incorporation of fluctuation effects , is important to describe thermodynamics of a pure gauge theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present our lattice results for the polyakov loop susceptibilities and their ratios . in section",
    "iii we introduce the effective polyakov loop model and its comparison with lattice data . in the last section we present our summary and conclusions .",
    "on a @xmath11 lattice , the polyakov loop is defined as the trace of the product over temporal gauge links ,    @xmath12    due to the @xmath1 symmetry of the pure gauge action , this quantity is exactly zero , when averaging over all gauge field configurations .",
    "furthermore , the polyakov loop is strongly @xmath13 dependent and needs to be renormalized .",
    "we consider the multiplicatively renormalized polyakov loop @xcite ,    @xmath14    and introduce the ensemble average of the modulus thereof , @xmath15 .",
    "the latter is well defined in the continuum and thermodynamic limits .",
    "the thermal average of the renormalized polyakov loop can also be obtained from the long distance behavior of the renormalized heavy quark - antiquark free energy @xmath16 @xcite , which is defined by the correlation function @xmath17    in the confined phase , the heavy quark - antiquark free energy rises linearly with distance as @xmath18 , hence the polyakov loop vanishes .",
    "the polyakov loop is finite in the deconfined phase , and can serve as an order parameter for the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath1 center symmetry . note",
    "that both definitions , and , are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit .    using the renormalized polyakov loop",
    ", one can define the renormalized polyakov loop susceptibility as @xmath19 here , we anticipate the factor @xmath20 to define as an observable in the continuum limit .    in the su(3 ) gauge theory , the polyakov loop operator is complex .",
    "thus in addition to @xmath21 , one can also explore the longitudinal and transverse fluctuations of the polyakov loop @xcite    @xmath22.\\label{eq : chil}\\\\ t^3 \\chi_{t } = & \\frac{n_\\sigma^3}{n_\\tau^3 } \\left [ \\langle   ( l^{\\rm ren}_{t})^2 \\rangle - \\langle      l^{\\rm ren}_{t } \\rangle^2\\right],\\label{eq : chit }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]                            we have computed the polyakov loop susceptibilities using the ( 1,2)-tree - level symanzik improved gauge action on a @xmath5 lattice .",
    "we consider lattices of temporal size @xmath23 and @xmath24 and spatial extent @xmath7 varying from 16 to 64 .",
    "the temperatures for the three temporal lattice extents are set by varying the bare coupling and use the temperature scale determined by the zero temperature string tension , as well as the critical couplings of the deconfinement transition @xcite .",
    "the gauge field configurations were generated using one heatbath and four overrelaxation updates per sweep with @xmath25 sweeps in general and up to @xmath26 sweeps close to the critical temperature , @xmath9 .",
    "the renormalization constants , @xmath27 , were taken from @xcite .",
    "the statistical errors were obtained from a jackknife analysis and do not include any systematic error resulting from the renormalization procedure . in fig .",
    "[ fig : polyakov ] , we show the lattice gauge theory result for @xmath15 as a function of temperature .",
    "while no volume effects are visible in the deconfined phase , data at fixed @xmath13 in the confined phase , show the expected @xmath28 volume - dependence . considering results at fixed ratio @xmath29 , only small cut - off effects can be observed at high as well as at low temperatures .",
    "the deviation of the @xmath30 and 8 data between @xmath31 may be attributed to the uncertainty in the determination of the renormalization constants , rather than to the cut - off effects .    the results for the renormalized polyakov loop susceptibilities obtained on different lattice sizes are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sus ] . in the close vicinity of the phase transition , @xmath32 ,",
    "all three susceptibilities show rather strong cut - off and volume effects .",
    "such behavior is expected due to the first order nature of the phase transition in pure gauge theory . outside this region ,",
    "the fluctuations of longitudinal and the modulus of the polyakov loop , show only minimal dependence on @xmath13 and @xmath7 in both phases .",
    "the transverse susceptibility @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig : sus ] , however , is seen to exhibit stronger @xmath13 dependence in the deconfined phase .",
    "the ambiguities from the renormalization scheme can be avoided by considering the ratios of the susceptibilities of the polyakov loop .",
    "these are particularly interesting observables to identify the deconfinement phase transition @xcite . in the following , we study the influences of dynamical quarks on these ratios",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ ratioa ] and [ ratiot ] show the ratios @xmath34 and @xmath35 of different susceptibilities obtained in the su(3 ) pure gauge theory .",
    "also shown in this figure are results obtained in lattice qcd with ( 2 + 1)-flavor hisq action and for almost physical quark masses . for @xmath36 , the temperature in figs .",
    "[ ratioa ] and [ ratiot ] is normalized to the corresponding pseudo critical temperature at fixed number of flavors @xcite .",
    "in the su(3 ) pure gauge theory ( @xmath37 ) , the ratios @xmath38 and @xmath39 exhibit a @xmath40-like discontinuity at @xmath9 , and change only weakly with temperature on either side of the transition .",
    "consequently , the ratios of the polyakov loop susceptibilities , can be considered as an excellent probe of the phase change . in the confined phase",
    ", their constant values can be deduced from general symmetry arguments , and the observation that these susceptibilities are dominated by the quadratic terms of the effective action @xcite . in the deconfined phase , the ratio @xmath41 , as long as",
    ", the center symmetry is spontaneously broken in the real sector .",
    "the properties of @xmath39 above @xmath9 seen in fig .",
    "[ ratiot ] indicate , that in the su(3 ) pure gauge theory the fluctuations of the longitudinal part of the polyakov loop exceed that of the transverse part , while keeping the ratio almost @xmath42-independent .    in the presence of dynamical quarks ,",
    "the polyakov loop is no longer an order parameter and stays finite even in the low temperature phase .",
    "consequently , the ratios of the polyakov loop susceptibilities are modified due to explicit breaking of the @xmath1 center symmetry .",
    "we therefore expect the smoothening of these ratios across the pseudo critical temperature . indeed figs .",
    "[ ratioa ] and [ ratiot ] show , that in the presence of dynamical quarks , both ratios vary continuously with temperature .",
    "we observe that @xmath38 interpolates between the two limiting values set by the pure gauge theory , while the width of crossover region can correlate with the number of flavors and values of their masses .",
    "the ratio @xmath39 is strongly influenced by the existence of quarks .",
    "in addition to the stronger smoothening effect observed , its numerical values in the deconfined phase become temperature dependent , and deviate substantially from the pure gauge result .",
    "we also note the abrupt change of slopes of @xmath39 and @xmath38 near their respective transition point , in spite of the fact , that the light quark masses are small .",
    "a more quantitative investigations of the effects of quarks on the polyakov loop susceptibilities require further studies on the system size and the quark mass dependence of these quantities , as well as their extrapolation to the continuum and thermodynamic limit .",
    "we defer such analysis to later research .",
    "the non - perturbative aspects of qcd thermodynamics can be studied using effective models , with quarks and polyakov loop as relevant degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the parameters of such models are fixed , so as to reproduce the lattice results on different observables .",
    "we take advantage of our new lattice data on the polyakov loop susceptibilities to construct a phenomenological polyakov loop potential which takes fluctuations into account .",
    "the most commonly used polyakov loop models are the polynomial @xcite and the logarithmic potential @xcite , the latter includes the contribution of su(3 ) haar measure . while both models are constructed to match the lattice data on the equation of state and the average polyakov loop , they predict very different results for the polyakov loop susceptibilities .",
    "in particular , the polynomial model suggests , that for @xmath43 , the ratio @xmath44 , while the logarithmic model gives @xmath45 . in this regard , the lattice data in fig .",
    "[ ratiot ] clearly favors the model with the haar measure included .",
    "moreover , as noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ratio @xmath44 , would lead to the negative susceptibility @xmath46 , which is unphysical .",
    "this is in line with the theoretical expectation , that the logarithmic model is preferred , as it enforces the restriction of the polyakov loop to the target region @xcite",
    ".    figs . [",
    "fig : pm ] and [ fig : shpl ] show comparison of the logarithmic potential model from ref .",
    "@xcite with the su(3 ) lattice data .",
    "the model provides a reasonable description of the lattice equation of state and the specific heat .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of the renormalized polyakov loop is described only in the vicinity of @xmath9 .",
    "this is hardly surprising , since the lattice data on the renormalized polyakov loop overshoot unity at @xmath47 . for any potential model , that complies to the restriction of the haar measure",
    ", the polyakov loop can never exceed unity . to tackle this problem in model calculations , we employ a smooth extrapolation of lattice data , from the temperature range @xmath48 , to unity at high temperature .",
    "[ fig : shpl]-right shows such matching of the model results from ref .",
    "@xcite to the su(3 ) lattice data on the renormalized polyakov loop .    the potential from ref .",
    "@xcite fails to reproduce the temperature dependence of the longitudinal and transverse susceptibility of the polyakov loop , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_sus ] .",
    "thus , considerations of the equation of state and @xmath49 alone , are not sufficient to describe the pure yang - mills thermodynamics .",
    "one needs to take into account the effects of fluctuations .        to construct the thermodynamic potential , which is capable to quantify lattice data on fluctuations , we consider the following @xmath1 symmetric model @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the su(3 ) haar measure , which is expressed by the polyakov loop and its conjugate , as @xmath52 the restriction of the polyakov loop to the target region is naturally enforced by the haar measure . for the special case of vanishing @xmath53 and @xmath54 , the potential in eq .",

    "this yields small differences between our and the previous @xcite polyakov loop model results .",

    "the previously proposed logarithmic potential , lies in the prediction for the polyakov loop fluctuations . figs . [",
    "fig : m_sus ] shows , that both the longitudinal and the transverse susceptibility are very well described by the new polyakov loop potential , while the logarithmic model tends to underestimate both susceptibilities .",
