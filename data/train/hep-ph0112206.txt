    "since quarks which are antisymmetric in color attract , cold dense quark matter is unstable to the formation of a condensate of cooper pairs , making it a color superconductor @xcite . at asymptotic densities , the ground state of qcd with quarks of three flavors ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) with equal masses",
    "is expected to be the color - flavor locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite .",
    "this phase features a condensate of cooper pairs of quarks which includes @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 pairs .",
    "quarks of all colors and all flavors participate in the pairing , and all excitations with quark quantum numbers are gapped . in this phase ,",
    "left - flavor and right - flavor symmetries are both locked to color , breaking chiral symmetry  @xcite . as in any bcs state ,",
    "the cooper pairing in the cfl state pairs quarks whose momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction , and pairing is strongest between pairs of quarks whose momenta are both near their respective fermi surfaces . pairing persists even in the face of a stress ( such as a chemical potential difference or a mass difference ) that seeks to push the fermi surfaces apart , although a stress that is too strong will ultimately disrupt cooper pairing  @xcite .",
    "thus , the cfl phase persists for unequal quark masses , so long as the differences are not too large  @xcite .",
    "this means that the cfl phase is the ground state for real qcd , assumed to be in equilibrium with respect to the weak interactions , as long as the density is high enough .",
    "imagine decreasing the quark number chemical potential @xmath9 from asymptotically large values .",
    "the quark matter at first remains color - flavor locked , although the cfl condensate may rotate in flavor space as terms of order @xmath10 in the free energy become important  @xcite .",
    "color - flavor locking is maintained until a transition to a state in which some quarks become ungapped .",
    "this `` unlocking transition '' , which must be first order  @xcite , occurs when  @xcite @xmath11 in this expression , @xmath2 is the bcs pairing gap , estimated in both models and asymptotic analyses to be of order tens to 100 mev  @xcite , and @xmath0 is the strange quark mass parameter .",
    "@xmath0 includes the contribution from any @xmath12 condensate induced by the nonzero current strange quark mass , making it a density - dependent effective mass , decreasing as density increases and equaling the current strange quark mass only at asymptotically high densities . at densities which may arise at the center of compact stars , corresponding to @xmath13 mev , @xmath0 is certainly significantly larger than the current quark mass , and its value is not well - known .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 decreases discontinuously at the unlocking transition  @xcite .",
    "thus , the criterion ( [ approxunlocking ] ) can only be used as a rough guide to the location of the unlocking transition in nature  @xcite .",
    "given this quantitative uncertainty , there remain two logical possibilities for what happens as a function of decreasing @xmath9 .",
    "one possibility is a first order phase transition directly from color - flavor locked quark matter to hadronic matter , as explored in ref .",
    "the second possibility is an unlocking transition  @xcite to quark matter in which not all quarks participate in the dominant pairing , followed only at a lower @xmath9 by a transition to hadronic matter .",
    "we assume the second possibility here , and explore its consequences .",
    "once cfl is disrupted , leaving some species of quarks with differing fermi momenta and therefore unable to participate in bcs pairing , it is natural to ask whether there is some generalization of the ansatz in which pairing between two species of quarks persists even once their fermi momenta differ .",
    "crystalline color superconductivity is the answer to this question .",
    "the idea is that it may be favorable for quarks with differing fermi momenta to form pairs whose momenta are _ not _ equal in magnitude and opposite in sign  @xcite .",
    "this generalization of the pairing ansatz ( beyond bcs anstze in which only quarks with momenta which add to zero pair ) is favored because it gives rise to a region of phase space where _ both _ of the quarks in a pair are close to their respective fermi surfaces , and such pairs can be created at low cost in free energy .",
    "condensates of this sort spontaneously break translational and rotational invariance , leading to gaps which vary in a crystalline pattern .",
    "as a function of increasing depth in a compact star , @xmath9 increases , @xmath0 decreases , and @xmath2 changes also .",
    "if in some shell within the quark matter core of a neutron star ( or within a strange quark star ) the quark number densities are such that crystalline color superconductivity arises , rotational vortices may be pinned in this shell , making it a locus for glitch phenomena  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of these ideas in the context of the disruption of cfl pairing is complicated by the fact that in quark matter in which cfl pairing does not occur , up and down quarks may nevertheless continue to pair in the usual bcs fashion . in this 2sc phase , which was the earliest color superconducting phase to be studied  @xcite , the attractive channel involves the formation of cooper pairs which are antisymmetric in both color and flavor , yielding a condensate with color ( greek indices ) and flavor ( latin indices ) structure @xmath14 .",
    "this condensate leaves five quarks unpaired : up and down quarks of the third color , and strange quarks of all three colors .",
    "because the bcs pairing scheme leaves ungapped quarks with differing fermi momenta , crystalline color superconductivity may result .    to date ,",
    "crystalline color superconductivity has only been studied in the simplified model context with pairing between two quark species whose fermi momenta are pushed apart by turning on a chemical potential difference  @xcite , rather than considering cfl pairing in the presence of quark mass differences .",
    "our goal in this paper is to investigate the ways in which the response of the system to mass differences is similar to or different from the response to chemical potential differences .",
    "we can address this question within the two - flavor model by generalizing it to describe pairing between massless up quarks and strange quarks with mass @xmath0 . for completeness ,",
    "we introduce @xmath15 allowing us to consider the effects of @xmath0 and @xmath1 simultaneously .",
    "we shall use this two - flavor toy model throughout , deferring an analysis of crystalline color superconductivity induced by the effects of @xmath0 on three - flavor quark matter to future work .      before describing the consequences of @xmath17 , let us review the salient facts known about the consequences of @xmath16 , upon taking @xmath18 . if @xmath19 is nonzero but less than some @xmath20 , the ground state in the two - flavor toy - model is precisely that obtained for @xmath21 @xcite .  @xcite . ] in this 2sc state , red and green up and strange quarks pair , yielding four quasiparticles with superconducting gap @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the number density of red and green up quarks is the same as that of red and green strange quarks .",
    "as long as @xmath19 is not too large , this bcs state remains unchanged ( and favored ) because maintaining equal number densities , and thus coincident fermi surfaces , maximizes the pairing and hence the interaction energy .",
    "as @xmath19 is increased , the bcs state remains the ground state of the system only as long as its negative interaction energy offsets the large positive free energy cost associated with forcing the fermi seas to remain coincident . in the weak coupling limit , in which @xmath22 , the bcs state persists for @xmath23 @xcite . for larger @xmath2 , the @xmath24 coefficient changes in value .",
    "these conclusions are the same whether the interaction between quarks is modeled as a point - like four - fermion interaction or is approximated by single - gluon exchange  @xcite .",
    "the loss of bcs pairing at @xmath25 is the analogue in this toy model of the unlocking transition .    if @xmath26 , bcs pairing between @xmath3 and @xmath5 is not possible .",
    "however , in a range @xmath27 near the unpairing transition , it is favorable to form a crystalline color superconducting state in which the cooper pairs have nonzero momentum .",
    "this phenomenon was first analyzed by larkin and ovchinnikov and fulde and ferrell  @xcite ( loff ) in the context of pairing between electrons in which spin - up and spin - down fermi momenta differ .",
    "it has proven difficult to find a condensed matter physics system which is well described simply as bcs pairing in the presence of a zeeman effect : any magnetic perturbation that may induce a zeeman effect tends to have much larger effects on the motion of the electrons , as in the meissner effect .",
    "the qcd context of interest to us , in which the fermi momenta being split are those of different flavors rather than of different spins , therefore turns out to be the natural arena for the phenomenon first analyzed by loff .",
    "the crystalline color superconducting phase ( also called the loff phase ) has been described in ref .",
    "@xcite ( following refs .",
    "@xcite ) upon making the simplifying assumption that quarks interact via a four - fermion interaction with the quantum numbers of single gluon exchange . in the loff state , each cooper pair carries momentum @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "the condensate and gap parameter vary in space with wavelength @xmath30 .",
    "although the magnitude @xmath31 is determined energetically , the direction @xmath32 is chosen spontaneously .",
    "the loff state is characterized by a gap parameter @xmath33 and a diquark condensate , but not by an energy gap in the dispersion relation : the quasiparticle dispersion relations vary with the direction of the momentum , yielding gaps that vary from zero up to a maximum of @xmath33 .",
    "the condensate is dominated by those regions in momentum space in which a quark pair with total momentum @xmath28 has both members of the pair within @xmath34 of their respective fermi surfaces .",
    "these regions form circular bands on the two fermi surfaces . making the ansatz that all cooper pairs make the same choice of direction @xmath32 corresponds to choosing a single circular band on each fermi surface . in position space",
    ", it corresponds to a condensate which varies in space like @xmath35 this ansatz is certainly _ not _ the best choice .",
    "if a single plane wave is favored , why not two ?",
    "that is , if one choice of @xmath32 is favored , why not add a second @xmath36 , with the same @xmath31 but a different @xmath32 ? if two are favored , why not three ?",
    "this question , namely , the determination of the favored crystal structure of the crystalline color superconductor phase , is unresolved but is under investigation .",
    "note , however , that if we find a region @xmath27 in which the simple loff ansatz with a single @xmath32 is favored over the bcs state and over no pairing , then the loff state with whatever crystal structure turns out to be optimal must be favored in _ at least _ this region .",
    "note also that even the single @xmath32 ansatz , which we use henceforth , breaks translational and rotational invariance spontaneously .",
    "the resulting phonon has been analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "crystalline color superconductivity is favored within a window @xmath27 .",
    "as @xmath19 increases from 0 , one finds a first order phase transition from the ordinary bcs phase to the crystalline color superconducting phase at @xmath25 and then a second order phase transition at @xmath37 at which @xmath33 decreases to zero .",
    "because the condensation energy in the loff phase is much smaller than that of the bcs condensate at @xmath38 , the value of @xmath20 is almost identical to that at which the naive unpairing transition from the bcs state to the state with no pairing would occur if one ignored the possibility of a loff phase , namely @xmath39 . for all practical purposes , therefore",
    ", the loff gap equation is not required in order to determine @xmath20 .",
    "the loff gap equation is used to determine @xmath40 and the properties of the crystalline color superconducting phase @xcite . in the limit of a weak four - fermion interaction , the crystalline color superconductivity window",
    "is bounded by @xmath39 and @xmath41 , as first demonstrated in refs .",
    "these results have been extended beyond the weak four - fermion interaction limit in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now know that the use of the simplified point - like interaction significantly underestimates the width of the loff window : assuming instead that quarks interact by exchanging medium - modified gluons yields a much larger value of @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "this can be understood upon noting that quark - quark interaction by gluon exchange is dominated by forward scattering . in most scatterings ,",
    "the angular positions on their respective fermi surfaces do not change much . in the loff state ,",
    "small - angle scattering is advantageous because it can not scatter a pair of quarks out of the region of momentum space in which both members of the pair are in their respective circular bands , where pairing is favored .",
    "this means that it is natural that a forward - scattering dominated interaction like single - gluon exchange is much more favorable for crystalline color superconductivity that a point - like interaction , which yields @xmath5-wave scattering .",
    "thus , although for the present we shall use the point - like interaction in our analysis of @xmath0-induced crystalline color superconductivity , it is worth remembering that this is very conservative .      in the absence of any interaction , and",
    "thus in the absence of pairing , the effect of a strange quark mass is to shift the fermi momenta to @xmath42 assuming both @xmath43 and @xmath44 are small , the separation between the two fermi momenta is @xmath45 .",
    "this suggests the conjecture that even when @xmath17 the description given in the previous subsection continues to be valid upon replacing @xmath19 by @xmath46 .",
    "we shall see in section 3 that this conjecture is _ incorrect _ in one key respect : whereas if @xmath18 a @xmath19 which is nonzero but smaller than @xmath20 has no effect on the bcs state , the bcs gap @xmath2 decreases with increasing @xmath47 , as we discuss further in an appendix .",
    "we show that for small @xmath47 , @xmath48 decreases linearly with @xmath47 .",
    "because @xmath2 occurs in the free energy in a term of order @xmath49 , the @xmath0-dependence of @xmath2 corrects the free energy by of order @xmath50 . as @xmath1 has no analogous effect ,",
    "we conclude that @xmath51 and @xmath1 have qualitatively different effects on the paired state .    at another level",
    ", however , the story _ is _ quite similar to that for @xmath18 : if @xmath46 is small enough , we find the bcs state ; if @xmath46 lies within an intermediate window , we find loff pairing ; if @xmath46 is large enough , no pairing is possible .",
    "the boundaries between the phases , however , are related to a @xmath52 , rather than simply to a constant @xmath2 .",
    "that is , the definitions of `` small enough '' and `` large enough '' are @xmath0-dependent .",
    "we map the @xmath53 plane in this paper . in section 2",
    ", we derive a gap equation which we then use in section 3 to analyze the bcs phase , finding the region of the @xmath53 plane in which bcs pairing is favored , and again use in section 4 to analyze crystalline color superconductivity , finding windows in the @xmath53 plane in which loff pairing is favored .",
    "in this section , we sketch the derivation of the gap equation which describes either the bcs or the loff states in a two - flavor theory with @xmath17 and @xmath54 . in the crystalline color superconducting phase ,",
    "the condensate contains pairs of @xmath3 and @xmath5 quarks with momenta such that the total momentum of each cooper pair is given by @xmath28 , with the direction of @xmath55 chosen spontaneously .",
    "as noted above , wherever there is an instability towards ( [ simplifiedcondensate ] ) , we expect the true ground state to be a crystalline condensate which varies in space like a sum of several such plane waves with the same @xmath31 .",
    "( to recover the bcs gap equation from that which we now derive , simply set @xmath56 . )    in order to describe pairing between @xmath3 quarks with momentum @xmath57 and @xmath5 quarks with momentum @xmath58 , we use a modified nambu - gorkov propagator : @xmath59 note that by @xmath60 we mean the four - vector @xmath61 .",
    "the cooper pairs have nonzero total momentum but the ground state condensate ( [ simplifiedcondensate ] ) is static .",
    "the momentum dependence of ( [ psi ] ) is motivated by the fact that in the presence of a crystalline color superconducting condensate , anomalous propagation does not only mean picking up or losing two quarks from the condensate .",
    "it also means picking up or losing momentum @xmath28 .",
    "the basis ( [ psi ] ) has been chosen so that the inverse fermion propagator in the crystalline color superconducting phase is diagonal in @xmath62-space and is given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and the matrix @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 . note that the condensate is explicitly antisymmetric in flavor .",
    "@xmath67 is the relative momentum of the quarks in a given pair and is different for different pairs . in the gap equation below , we shall integrate over @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "as desired , the off - diagonal blocks describe anomalous propagation in the presence of a condensate of diquarks with momentum @xmath28 .",
    "we obtain the gap equation by solving the one - loop schwinger - dyson equation given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the gluon propagator , @xmath72 is the full quark propagator , whose inverse is given by ( [ sinv ] ) , and @xmath73 is the fermion propagator in the absence of interaction , given by @xmath72 with @xmath74 .",
    "the vertex is defined as @xmath75    as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we simplify the interaction between quarks by making it point - like . that is , we replace @xmath76 by @xmath77 .",
    "our model hamiltonian has two parameters , the four - fermion coupling @xmath78 and a cutoff @xmath79 on the three - momentum @xmath69 .",
    "the dependence on the cutoff has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite : upon varying @xmath79 while at the same time varying the coupling @xmath78 such that @xmath2 is kept fixed , the relation between other physical quantities and @xmath2 is reasonably insensitive to variation of @xmath79 .",
    "we often use the value of the bcs gap @xmath2 obtained at @xmath80 to parametrize the strength of the interaction .",
    "we can do this because @xmath2 increases monotonically with increasing @xmath78 .",
    "doing so proves convenient because both @xmath20 and @xmath40 are given simply when written in terms of the physical quantity @xmath2 , whereas writing them in terms of the model - dependent parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 requires unwieldy expressions .",
    "after some algebra ( essentially the determination of @xmath72 given @xmath81 specified above ) , and upon suitable projection , the schwinger - dyson equation ( [ sdeq ] ) reduces to a gap equation for the gap parameter @xmath33 given ( in euclidean space ) by @xmath82 \\left[(p_0-i{\\mu}+i\\delta\\mu)^2 - |{\\bf p}+{\\bf q}|^2\\right]}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath83 eq .

    "these contributions can be removed using the methods of ref .",
    "@xcite ( and if one does so and then sets @xmath18 one obtains the gap equation of ref .",
