    "recently there has been much interest in the study of @xmath1-meson production in @xmath4 collisions at hadron colliders , both experimentally and theoretically . the cdf collaboration measured differential cross sections @xmath5 for the inclusive production of @xmath1 mesons ( and their anti - particles ) in @xmath4 collisions at the fermilab tevatron as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath0 in the central rapidity ( @xmath6 ) region @xcite . the data reported in ref .",
    "@xcite were collected in the run period from 1992 to 1995 ( runs ia and i ) at a center - of - mass ( c.m . ) energy of @xmath7  tev and were obtained using fully reconstructed @xmath8 mesons decaying into the exclusive final state @xmath9 .",
    "the data presented in ref .",
    "@xcite come from measurements in run ii with @xmath10  tev , where the inclusive differential production cross section of @xmath11 mesons was used and the fraction of events from the decay of long - lived @xmath12 hadrons was separated by analyzing the lifetime distribution .",
    "these @xmath12 hadrons include @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 mesons . the data in ref .",
    "@xcite were also taken at @xmath10  tev in run ii . in this case , the inclusive cross section for the production of @xmath8 mesons was obtained , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , by reconstructing @xmath17 decays .",
    "very recently , cdf presented preliminary data from run  ii based on events with @xmath18 followed by @xmath19 and @xmath20 followed by @xmath21 and @xmath19 collected with the lepton - plus - displaced - track trigger @xcite .",
    "these data explore the range 25  gev@xmath22  gev for the first time .",
    "although the measurement of @xmath1 mesons is experimentally well defined , theoretical predictions did not agree with the data in the past .    in order to calculate the @xmath1-meson production cross section , the non - perturbative fragmentation function ( ff ) for the transition",
    "@xmath23 must be known beforehand .",
    "the qcd - improved parton model implemented in the modified minimal - subtraction ( @xmath24 ) renormalization and factorization scheme then provides a rigorous theoretical framework for a coherent global data analysis .    in this framework , two distinct approaches for next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) calculations in perturbative qcd have been used for comparisons with experimental data . in the so - called massless scheme or zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) @xcite , which is the conventional parton model approach ,",
    "the zero - mass - parton approximation is applied also to the @xmath12 quark , although its mass @xmath25 is certainly much larger than the asymptotic scale parameter @xmath26 . in this approach ,",
    "the @xmath12 quark is also treated as an incoming parton originating from the ( anti)proton , leading to additional contributions besides those from @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 quarks and the gluon ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "although this approach can be used as soon as the factorization scales associated with the initial- and final - state singularities are above the starting scale of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and the ffs , the predictions are reliable only in the region of large @xmath0 values , with @xmath32 , where terms of the order of @xmath33 can safely be neglected .",
    "a nlo calculation in this scheme automatically resums leading and next - to - leading logarithms ( nll ) , _ i.e. _  terms of the form @xmath34^n$ ] and @xmath35^n$ ] with @xmath36 . at the same time , all non - logarithmic terms through @xmath37 relative to the born approximation are retained for @xmath38 .",
    "the other calculational scheme is the so - called massive scheme or fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) @xcite , in which the number of active flavors in the initial state is limited to @xmath39 , and the @xmath12 quark appears only in the final state . in this case , the @xmath12 quark is always treated as a heavy particle , not as a parton .",
    "the actual mass parameter @xmath25 is explicitly taken into account along with @xmath0 . in this scheme , @xmath25 acts as a cutoff for the initial- and final - state collinear singularities and sets the scale for the perturbative calculations . a factorization of these would - be initial- and final - state collinear singularities is not necessary , neither is the introduction of a ff for the transition @xmath23 .",
    "however , at nlo , terms proportional to @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the strong - coupling constant , arise from collinear gluon emissions by @xmath12 quarks or from branchings of gluons into collinear @xmath42 pairs .",
    "these terms are of order @xmath43 for large values of @xmath0 , and with the choice @xmath44 for the renormalization scale they spoil the convergence of the perturbation series . the ffns with @xmath39 should thus be limited to a rather small range of @xmath0 , from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "the advantage of this scheme is that the @xmath33 power terms are fully taken into account .",
    "the zm - vfns and ffns are valid in complementary regions of @xmath0 , and it is desirable to combine them in a unified approach that incorporates the virtues of both schemes , _",
    "i.e. _  to resum the large logarithms , retain the full finite-@xmath25 effects , and preserve the universality of the ffs .",
    "this is necessary for a reliable and meaningful interpretation of the cdf data @xcite , which mostly lie in the transition region of the two schemes .",
    "an earlier approach to implement such an interpolation is the so - called fixed - order - next - to - leading - logarithm ( fonll ) scheme , in which the conventional cross section in the ffns is linearly combined with a suitably modified cross section in the zm - vfns with perturbative ffs , using a @xmath0-dependent weight function @xcite .",
    "then the fonll cross section is convoluted with a non - perturbative ff for the @xmath23 transition .",
    "these ffs are adjusted to @xmath2 data , using the same approach , and good agreement with the cdf data was obtained .    in this work ,",
    "we wish to present the results of an approach that is much closer in spirit to the zm - vfns , but keeps all @xmath33 power terms in the hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "this scheme is called general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) and has recently been worked out for the photoproduction @xcite and hadroproduction @xcite of charmed hadrons . in this approach ,",
    "one starts from the region @xmath32 and absorbs the large logarithms @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the factorization scale of the initial or final state , into the @xmath12-quark pdf of the incoming hadrons and the ff for the @xmath23 transition .",
    "after factorizing the @xmath49 terms , the cross section is infrared safe in the limit @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is taken in the strong - coupling constant and the dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) evolution equations .",
    "the remaining @xmath25-dependent contributions , _",
    "i.e. _  the @xmath33 power terms , are retained in the hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "these terms are very important in the region of intermediate @xmath0 values , @xmath46 , and are expected to improve the theoretical predictions as compared to the zm - vfns .",
    "the large logarithms are absorbed into the pdfs and ffs by subtraction of the collinearly ( mass ) singular terms at the initial- and final - state factorization scales , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the subtraction of just the collinearly , _",
    "i.e._mass singular terms , does not define a unique factorization prescription . also finite terms must be specified . in the conventional zm - vfns calculation ,",
    "one puts @xmath38 from the beginning , and the collinearly divergent terms are defined with the help of dimensional regularization .",
    "this fixes the finite terms in a specific way , and their form is inherent to the chosen regularization procedure . if one starts with @xmath52 and performs the limit @xmath53 afterwards , the finite terms are different .",
    "these terms have to be removed by subtraction together with the @xmath49 terms in such a way that , in the limit @xmath54 , the known massless @xmath24 expressions are recovered .",
    "this matching procedure is needed , since we use pdfs and ffs defined in the zm - vfns .",
    "a subtraction scheme defined in this way is the correct extension of the conventional zm - vfns to include @xmath12-quark ( or similarly @xmath30-quark ) mass effects in a consistent way .",
    "we actually include the @xmath30-quark contribution in the massless approximation , _ i.e. _  we treat the @xmath30 quark as one of the light partons .",
    "the results of our earlier work on charmed - hadron inclusive production by @xmath4 scattering at nlo in the gm - vfns @xcite directly carry over to @xmath12 hadrons .",
    "then , the @xmath12 quark is the heavy one , with mass @xmath25 , while the @xmath30 quark belongs to the group of light quarks , collectively denoted by @xmath55 in the following , whose mass is put to zero . furthermore , we need pdfs and ffs implemented with @xmath51 in the @xmath24 factorization scheme",
    ". non - perturbative ffs for the transitions @xmath56 , where @xmath57 , were extracted at leading order ( lo ) and nlo already several years ago @xcite using data for the scaled - energy ( @xmath58 ) distribution @xmath59 of @xmath60 at @xmath61  gev measured by the opal collaboration at cern lep1 @xcite .",
    "we note that our implementation of the gm - vfns is similar to the aivazis - collins - olness - tung ( acot ) @xcite scheme formulated for the initial state of fully inclusive deep - inelastic scattering .",
    "the extension of this scheme to the inclusive production of heavy partons was considered in ref .",

    "new and more precise measurements of the cross section of inclusive @xmath1-meson production in @xmath2 annihilation on the @xmath72-boson resonance have been published by the aleph @xcite , opal @xcite , and sld @xcite collaborations , which motivates us to update the analysis of ref .",

    "specifically , the subtractions affect initial states involving @xmath110 splittings and final states involving @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 splittings , and they introduce logarithmic dependences on the initial- and final - state factorization scales in the hard - scattering cross sections of class  ( i ) , which are compensated through nlo by the respective factorization scale dependences of the @xmath12-quark pdf and the @xmath23 ff , respectively .",

    "@xcite . a certain part of the class-(ii ) and class-(iii ) contributions is due to feynman diagrams with internal @xmath12-quark lines ; another one is due to diagrams with external @xmath12-quark lines and contains @xmath25-dependent logarithms , which are resummed . in the ffns",
    ", the @xmath25 dependence of these contributions would only enter beyond nlo , which is reflected in the zm - vfns by the generic suppression of the @xmath12-quark pdf relative to the gluon and @xmath94-quark ones and of the gluon and @xmath94-quark ffs relative to the @xmath12-quark one .",

    "we first investigate the effect of the finite-@xmath25 terms in the hard - scattering cross sections and thus concentrate on the contribution of class ( i ) for the time being .",
    "this effect can already be studied at lo , where the partonic subprocesses read @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",

    "however , as will become apparent below , the contributions of class ( i ) are overwhelmed by those of classes ( ii ) and ( iii ) , so that the finite-@xmath25 effects are washed out in the final predictions , except for very small values of @xmath0 .",

    "@xcite , we observe that the relative influence of the finite-@xmath25 effects is much smaller in the @xmath30-quark case , as expected because the @xmath30 quark is much lighter than the @xmath12 quark .    in the remainder of this section",

    "it is clear that our present implementation of the gm - vfns is not suitable for cross section calculations in the small-@xmath0 region .",
    "although the gm - vfns is designed to approach the ffns and the zm - vfns in its regions of validity without introducing additional ad - hoc matching factors , to implement this numerically is a non - trivial task due to necessary cancellations between different terms in the calculation .",

    "these undesirable features will eventually be removed once the matching with the ffns is specified and implemented .",
    "this is a so - called implementation issue @xcite that needs to be added on top of the definition of the pure gm - vfns .",
    "this is beyond the scope of the present paper , which is concerned with the intermediate @xmath0 range , and will be treated in a future publication . at this point",
    ", we would like to recall how this implementation issue is handled for the fonll scheme @xcite . in that scheme ,",
    "the ffns and zm - vfns calculations are merged in such a way that the contribution that is added on to the ffns result , _",
    "i.e. _  the zm - vfns result with the zero - mass limit of the ffns result subtracted , is multiplied by a weight function of the form @xmath140 with @xmath141 to model a smooth transition .",
    "furthermore , the variable @xmath0 of the subtracted zm - vfns contribution is shifted to become @xmath142 . in the region where the zm - vfns prediction has a large scale uncertainty , _",
    "i.e. _  where @xmath0 is 23 times larger than @xmath25 say , this weight function is still rather small , ranging from 14% to 26% .",
    "thus , this weight function not only smoothens the transition , but also ensures that the sizeable theoretical uncertainty of the zm - vfns component in the transition region is not reflected in the fonll prediction , creating the impression that the latter has a small theoretical error . of course ,",
    "this source of theoretical uncertainty unavoidably resurfaces when the form of the weight function , which is a priori unknown , is varied , _",
    "e.g. _  by changing the value of its parameter @xmath30 .",
    "unfortunately , such a variation is not included in the theoretical error of recent fonll predictions @xcite .",
    "we now extend our numerical analysis to include the nlo prediction in the ffns , with @xmath39 massless quark flavors in the initial state , which allows us to also compare with the small-@xmath0 data from ref .  @xcite . in the ffns analysis",
    ", we evaluate @xmath143 with @xmath39 and @xmath144  mev @xcite , while we continue using the cteq6.1 m proton pdfs @xcite , in want of a rigorous ffns set with @xmath39 . in the ffns",
    ", there is no room for dglap - evolved ffs , and only @xmath95 transitions are included . for simplicity",
    ", we identify @xmath12 ( anti)quarks with @xmath1 mesons and account for non - perturbative effects by including the branching fraction @xmath145 @xcite as an overall normalization factor , _",
    "i.e._we use a @xmath23 ff of the form @xmath146 , while the @xmath109 ffs are put to zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the central ffns ( dot - dashed line ) , zm - vfns ( dashed line ) , and gm - vfns ( solid line ) predictions , for @xmath122 , are compared with the cdf data from refs .",
    "@xcite . as in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , some of the data points with @xmath147  gev from ref .",
    "@xcite are omitted for clarity . since the zm - vfns and our present implementation of the gm - vfns are not applicable to the small-@xmath0 range",
    ", we show the respective predictions only for @xmath148  gev . the gm - vfns prediction shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] is identical with the central one in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . by construction , it merges with the zm - vfns prediction with increasing value of @xmath0 . in accordance with the expectation expressed in the discussion of figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , the difference between the gm - vfns and zm - vfns results is rather modest also at @xmath149 , since the @xmath25-dependent contribution , of class  ( i ) , is numerically small and overwhelmed by the @xmath25-independent ones , of classes ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "the ffns prediction faithfully describes the peak structure exhibited by the next - to - latest cdf data @xcite in the small-@xmath0 range and it also nicely agrees with the latest cdf data @xcite way out to the largest @xmath0 values .",
    "in fact , for @xmath150 , where its perturbative stability is jeopardized by unresummed logarithms of the form @xmath151 , the ffns prediction almost coincides with the gm - vfns one , where such large logarithms are resummed .",
    "this is a pure coincidence , which becomes even more apparent if we also recall that the implementation of the @xmath95 transition in the ffns is not based on a factorization theorem and quite inappropriate for such large values of @xmath0 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , we limited our considerations to the range @xmath152  gev , where the published cdf data @xcite are located .",
    "however , the preliminary cdf data @xcite , collected in the very central part of the detector ( @xmath153 ) , cover the range 9  gev@xmath22  gev , and it is interesting to confront them with the nlo predictions of the three schemes considered here . moreover , it is instructive to study the breakdown of the ffns at sufficiently large values of @xmath0 due to unresummed large logarithms .",
    "for these purposes , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] an extension of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] including the preliminary cdf data .",
    "we observe that the gm - vfns result steadily merges with the zm - vfns one as the value of @xmath0 is increased , the relative deviations being 11% , 6% , and 3% at @xmath154 , 30 , and 50  gev , respectively .",
    "the ffns result breaks even with the gm - vfns one at about @xmath154  gev ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) and exceeds the latter for larger values of @xmath0 , the relative deviations being 20% , 48% , and 100% at @xmath155 , 50 , and 100  gev , respectively .",
    "our results indicate that a measurement of the @xmath0 distribution up to 4050  gev at the tevatron could be able to resolve the difference between the ffns and the vfns and so to establish for the first time the break - down of the ffns due to unresummed logarithms in the inclusive hadroproduction of heavy hadrons .",
    "this important question deserves a careful examination of the theoretical uncertainties , which we leave for a future publication .",
    "the preliminary cdf data point in the bin 29  gev@xmath22  gev favors the zm - vfns and gm - vfns results , while it undershoots the ffns result .",
    "we conclude this section with an interesting observation that , in retrospect , sheds some new light on the tevatron @xmath1-hadron anomaly mentioned above and does not appear to be sufficiently well known to the community . in fact , the common perception that the cdf data @xcite generally overshoot the ffns prediction , frequently denoted as nlo qcd in the literature , by a factor of 23 is entirely due the use of obsolete theoretical input .",
    "in fact , the ffns prediction that has been serving as a benchmark for some 15 years and still does even in very recent papers @xcite is evaluated with the proton pdf set mrsd0 by martin , roberts , and stirling @xcite , which has been revoked by these authors .",
    "it has an unacceptably weak gluon and a small value of @xmath156 , namely @xmath157  mev translating into @xmath158 , which is 3.3 standard deviations below the present world average @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "other inputs include @xmath160  gev and a peterson ff parameter of @xmath161 , extracted from a fit to @xmath2 annihilation data from the pre - lep / slc era using a monte - carlo event generator based on massless lo matrix elements @xcite . for reference , the historical ffns prediction evaluated with this choice of input",
    "is also included in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . since the fonll prediction @xcite is designed to merge with the ffns one at low values of @xmath0 , the additional contribution being faded out by a weight function of the form @xmath162 , the striking gap between the historical nlo qcd prediction and the fonll prediction , based on up - to - date input information , in fig .",
    "10 of ref .",
    "@xcite impressively illustrates the advancement in the pdf and @xmath41 determinations .",
    "the tuning of ffs in connection with the resummation of leading and next - to - leading logarithms , emphasized in the second paper of ref .",
    "@xcite , is actually of minor importance .",
    "for several years , the @xmath1-meson production rates measured at desy hera , cern lep2 , and tevatron have been notoriously exceeding , by up to a factor of three , the usual nlo qcd predictions for massive @xmath12 quarks , _ i.e. _  those in the ffns ( @xmath1-meson anomaly ) .",
    "this has even triggered theoretical attempts to interpret this deviation as a signal of new physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "however , it remained to be clarified if this deviation could be explained by improving and refining the qcd prediction itself . in this connection ,",
    "two of us , together with binnewies , pointed out almost a decade ago that the zm - vfns provides a rigorous theoretical framework for a coherent study of @xmath1-meson production in high - energy @xmath2 , @xmath120 , and other collisions , since the factorization theorem guarantees the universality of the @xmath1-meson ffs @xcite .",
    "in fact , the zm - vfns prediction @xcite was found to nicely agree with the cdf data from tevatron runs ia and i @xcite . however , a necessary condition for the applicability of the zm - vfns is that the energy scale that separates perturbative hard scattering from non - perturbative fragmentation ( final - state factorization scale @xmath48 ) is sufficiently large compared to the @xmath12-quark mass @xmath25 , and it had never been quite clear how large the ratio @xmath163 actually needed to be in order for finite-@xmath25 effects to be negligible .",
    "in fact , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite asserted in a footnote that mass corrections have a large size up to @xmath164  gev and that `` lack of mass effects @xcite will therefore erroneously overestimate the production rate at small @xmath0 . ''    in the present paper , we addressed this problem by performing a comparative analysis of @xmath1-meson hadroproduction in the zm - vfns and the gm - vfns , which we had successfully applied to @xmath93-meson production in @xmath165 @xcite , @xmath166 @xcite , and @xmath120 @xcite collisions in the past . for this",
    ", we also updated the determination of @xmath1-meson ffs @xcite by fitting to recent @xmath2 data from aleph @xcite , opal @xcite , and sld @xcite and also adjusting the values of @xmath25 and the energy scale @xmath167 where the dglap evolution starts to conform with modern pdf sets @xcite .",
    "we found that finite-@xmath25 effects moderately enhance the @xmath0 distribution ; the enhancement amounts to about 20% at @xmath168 and rapidly decreases with increasing value of @xmath0 , falling below 10% at @xmath169 .",
    "this finding contradicts earlier claims  @xcite in all respects .",
    "such effects are comparable in size to the theoretical uncertainty due to the freedom of choice in the setting of the renormalization and factorization scales . for comparison",
    ", we also evaluated the @xmath0 distribution in the ffns , with @xmath39 , using a delta - function - type @xmath23 ff without dglap evolution .",
    "confronting the three nlo predictions with the latest @xcite and next - to - latest @xcite cdf data sets published , we found that all of them agree rather well with the latest one , with @xmath147  gev . despite unresummed large logarithms and",
    "poorly implemented fragmentation , the ffns prediction happens to almost coincide with the gm - vfns one in the range 15  gev@xmath170  gev .",
    "the ffns prediction also nicely reproduces the peak exhibited about @xmath136  gev by the next - to - latest cdf data @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the historical benchmark result based on obsolete proton pdfs and a value of @xmath171 falling short of the present world average by 3.3 standard deviations , which goes under the name nlo qcd in the literature and is used as a reference point even in most recent papers @xcite , undershoots the cdf data by the familiar factor of 23 .",
    "this illustrates that the progress in our understanding of the proton pdfs and our knowledge of @xmath172 is instrumental in overcoming the long - standing tevatron @xmath1-hadron anomaly in the low to intermediate @xmath0 range . the preliminary cdf data @xcite favor the zm - vfns and gm - vfns results in the upmost bin , 29  gev@xmath22  gev , while they undershoot the ffns result .",
    "it is desirable to extend the applicability of the gm - vfns down to @xmath45 .",
    "this requires matching with the ffns . to achieve this in a way that avoids ad - hoc weight functions",
