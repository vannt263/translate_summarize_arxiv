    "in recent years we have seen oscillators coupled through nearest neighbors interactions to be used to understand the behavior of systems in physics , chemistry , biology , neurology as well as other disciplines , to model several phenomena such as : josephson junction arrays , multimode lasers , vortex dynamics in fluids , biological information processes , neurodynamics @xcite .",
    "these systems have been observed to synchronize themselves to a common frequency , when the coupling strength between these oscillators is increased @xcite . in spite of the diversity of the dynamics",
    ", the synchronization features of many of the above mentioned systems might be described using a simple model of weakly coupled phase oscillators such as the kuramoto model @xcite , as well as its variations to adapt it for finite range interactions which are more realistic to mimic many physical systems .",
    "difficulties arise since finite range coupled systems are difficult to analyze and to solve analytically . in spite of that , in order to figure out the collective phenomena when finite range interactions are considered , it is of fundamental importance to study and to understand the nearest neighbour interactions , which is the simplest form of the local interactions . in this context , a simplified version of the kuramoto model with nearest neighbour coupling in a ring topology , which we shall refer to as _ locally coupled kuramoto model _ ( lckm ) , is a good candidate to describe the dynamics of coupled systems with local interactions .",
    "several reports exist where the lckm has been used to represent the dynamics of a variety of systems , such as josephson junctions , coupled lasers , neurons , chains with disorders , multi - cellular systems in biology and in communication systems @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that the equations of the resistively shunted junction which describe a ladder array of overdamped , critical - current disordered josephson junctions that are current biased along the rungs of the ladder can be expressed by a lckm @xcite .",
    "for nearest neighbours coupled rssler oscillators the phase synchronization can be described by the lckm @xcite , as well as locally coupled lasers @xcite , where local interactions are dominant .",
    "lckm can also be used to model the occurrence of travelling waves in neurons @xcite . in communication systems",
    ", unidirectionally coupled kuramoto model can be used to describe an antenna array  @xcite .",
    "such unidirectionally coupled kuramoto models can be considered as a special case of the lckm and it often mimics the same behaviour . therefore , lckm can provide a way to understand phase synchronization in coupled systems in general .    while in the kuramoto model for long range interactions one has to rely on average quantities , in a mean field approximation or by means of an order parameter , etc .",
    ", in the local model it is necessary to study the behaviour of individual oscillators in order to understand the collective dynamics .",
    "therefore , due to the difficulty in applying standard techniques of statistical mechanics , one should look for a simple approach to understand the coupled system with local interactions by means of numerical study of a temporal behaviour of the individual oscillators .",
    "such analysis is necessary in order to obtain a close picture of the effect of the local interactions on synchronization . in this case",
    ", numerical investigations can assist to figure out the mechanism of interactions at the stage of complete synchronization which in turn helps to get an analytic solution .",
    "earlier studies on the lckm show several interesting features including tree structures with synchronized clusters , phase slips , bursting behaviour and saddle node bifurcation and so on @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that neighbouring elements share dominating frequencies in their time spectra , and that this feature plays an important role in the dynamics of formation of clusters in the local model @xcite ; that the order parameter , which measures the evolution of the phases of the nearest neighbour oscillators , becomes maximum at the partial synchronization points inside the tree of synchronization @xcite and a scheme has been developed based on the method of lagrange multipliers to estimate the critical coupling strength for complete synchronization in the local kuramoto model with different boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "very recently , we identified two oscillators which are responsible for dragging the system into full synchronization @xcite , and the difference in phase for this pair is @xmath0 . in this work",
    "we develop a method to obtain an analytic solution for the value of the critical coupling at which full synchronization occurs , once a set of initial conditions for the frequencies of the @xmath1 oscillators is assigned .",
    "this method will allow us not only to calculate the analytic form of the critical coupling but also to determine the number of oscillators at the major clusters in the vicinity of the critical coupling as well as to determine which is the pair of oscillators that has a phase difference @xmath0 at the stage of full synchronization .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ring ] we investigate the lckm where periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "we derive an analytic form for the critical coupling at the stage of complete synchronization as well and determine the number of oscillators at each cluster in the vicinity of the critical coupling . finally , in sec .",
    "[ finalwords ] we give a conclusion which is based on a summary of the results .",
    "the local model of nearest neighbour interactions , or lckm can be considered as a diffusive version of the kuramoto model , and it is expressed as @xcite : @xmath2 , \\label{eqring}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with periodic boundary conditions @xmath3 and for @xmath4 .",
    "the set of the initial values of frequencies @xmath5 are the natural frequencies which are taken from a gaussian distribution and @xmath6 is the coupling strength .",
    "the phase difference is defined as @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "these nonidentical oscillators ( [ eqring ] ) cluster in time averaged frequency , until they completely synchronize to a common value given by the average frequency @xmath9 , at a critical coupling @xmath10 .",
    "oscillators , with detailed composition of each cluster before full synchronization . ]    at @xmath11 the phases and the frequencies are time independent and all the oscillators remain synchronized . in fig.1",
    "we show the synchronization tree for a periodic system with @xmath12 oscillators , where the elements which compose each one of the major clusters are indicated in each branch .",
    "these clusters merge into one at @xmath10 where all oscillators have the same frequency .",
    "the major clusters just before @xmath10 contain @xmath13 and @xmath14 oscillators , where @xmath15 .",
    "it is not necessary for these clusters to have the same numbers of oscillators . at the vicinity of @xmath10 , major clusters of successive oscillators",
    "have sets of nearest neighbours at the borders .",
    "an interesting fact emerges : the phase - locked solution is always valid for one and only one phase difference , and this phase difference is between two oscillators at the border of the clusters @xcite .",
    "thus , for these two neighbouring oscillators , the equation for the phase difference is : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "equation ( [ pheql ] ) at @xmath10 has @xmath18 , and hence @xmath19 .",
    "it has been found that the phase - locked solution is satisfied when @xmath20 for the case of @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the reverse .",
    "in addition the phase - locked solution exists at @xcite @xmath23|=2 $ ] .",
    "it is already well known that in the vicinity of @xmath10 , phases as well as frequencies present the phenomenon of phase slip , that is , they remain constant for a given period of time @xmath24 and then they jump , followed by a another period of constant value , a jump and so on . during this period @xmath24 equation ( [ pheql ]",
    ") can be solved analytically to give quantities @xmath25 and @xmath26 . due to the diffusive character of the lckm , all other quantities @xmath27 and",
    "@xmath28 of other oscillators relate to @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see details in reference @xcite ) , and will in turn present the same phenomena , which has also been seen numerically @xcite . thus ,",
    "if one can develop a method to allocate the two oscillators which will have the phase difference @xmath29 , then it will be possible to determine the value @xmath30 and to obtain the critical coupling at which a complete synchronization occurs ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "a difficulty arises due to the determination of the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in addition to the topology of a ring which is an endless system .",
    "therefore , there is no direct method to specify the two oscillators @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which have phase difference that would satisfy the phase - lock condition .     at @xmath35 for the system of @xmath36 oscillators of fig.1 . ]",
    "we can take advantage that there are four oscillators , now labeled @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , at the borders of the major clusters in the vicinity of @xmath10 from which only one pair will have a phase difference corresponding to the phase - locked solution ; i.e , @xmath41 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the values of @xmath42 and @xmath43 are always the maximum and minimum of the @xmath44 s for all phase differences . from these two phase differences @xmath45 and @xmath46 , one of them has a value @xmath0 , while the other would be close @xmath47 , getting closer as @xmath1 increases .",
    "this fact has been verified numerically for several realizations of @xmath1 and @xmath5 s . if we start adding equations of the systems in a ring ( [ eqring ] ) ( adding elements ) in a similar way as in reference @xcite , we generate a sequence @xmath48 , with @xmath49 for @xmath50 . after a detailed study of existing correlations ,",
    "we arrive to a criteria to determine the four oscillators at the borders of the major clusters in the vicinity of @xmath10 .",
    "we find that the maximum value of @xmath48 refers always to the oscillators at one border while the minimum of @xmath48 points to the oscillators at the other border of the given cluster .",
    "one of them is always positive and the other is negative .",
    "the sign of @xmath48 depends on the values of @xmath51 : for @xmath52 , @xmath53 , while @xmath54 corresponds to @xmath55 .",
    "a thorough study also shows that the value of @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath52 while the @xmath57 corresponds to @xmath54 .",
    "thus we can calculate all the @xmath58 and assign the maximum and minimum values which refer to the integers @xmath37 and @xmath39 .",
    "however , we have not yet resolved which one refers to the two oscillators with the phase difference equals @xmath0 .",
    "since now we know how to point to the four oscillators @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 at the borders of major clusters at @xmath10 , it is possible to obtain an analytic form for @xmath10 , within reasonable accuracy .",
    "these two quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 are related to both values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 for a system of coupled oscillators in a ring ( [ eqring ] ) such that : @xmath61 = z_l \\\\ k_c\\left[\\sin(\\phi_m ) - \\sin(\\phi_n)\\right]= z_m .",
    "\\label{eqz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the value of @xmath62 presents a difficulty in determining which one of the phase differences @xmath45 or @xmath46 corresponds to @xmath63 , since the phase - lock condition at the critical coupling will be @xcite either @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",
    "we can then rely on numerical findings and characteristics of @xmath45 and @xmath46 to use equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) to obtain an approximate analytic expression for @xmath10 .",
    "a detailed numerical investigation of @xmath62 shows that it is always small , in comparison to both values @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and that @xmath10 depends mainly only on these two quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "taking this fact into consideration and since both @xmath42 and @xmath43 are always opposite in sign as well as the two quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we use equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) to obtain @xmath66 where @xmath67 depends on the difference between both @xmath68 and @xmath69 . helping ourselves by numerical studies we find that @xmath67 depends on the quantities @xmath70 and @xmath71 and it can can be written as @xmath72 .",
    "thus we obtain an approximate expression for @xmath10 , which we call @xmath73 , and is given by : @xmath74     versus @xmath1 from numerical simulation of system ( 1 ) ( triangles ) and analytic calculation using equation ( 6 ) ( circles ) and equation ( 5 ) with @xmath75 ( squares ) . ]",
    "fig.3 summarizes numerical investigations of the determinations of @xmath10 .",
    "we plot log@xmath10 versus log@xmath1 from numerical simulations of equation ( [ eqring ] ) ( triangles ) and from the analytic results given by ( [ eqkc3 ] ) , first by considering @xmath67 going to zero ( squares ) and then taking its complete dependence on both @xmath70 and @xmath71 ( circles ) .",
    "the validity of equation ( 6 ) is clearly shown for values of @xmath1 ranging from @xmath36 to @xmath76 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath10 on both @xmath77 and @xmath78 as in equation ( [ eqkc3 ] ) and as @xmath1 increases becomes clear .",
    "it can also be inferred that the term which depends on @xmath67 becomes negligible .",
    "this is due to the fact that as @xmath1 increases the oscillators of indexes @xmath37 and @xmath38 are becoming closer in frequencies to each other as well as the two oscillators of indexes @xmath39 and @xmath40",
    ". we also observe that @xmath10 grows as @xmath79 , in the same limit as found by strogatz and mirollo @xcite ( for details , see explanation in this reference ) .",
    "summarizing , if one knows the set of initial frequencies @xmath5 , it is possible to point at the four oscillators at the borders of the major clusters just below @xmath10 and then the calculation of @xmath10 is performed using equation ( 6 ) ( thus obtaining @xmath73 ) , without the need of computer simulation of system ( [ eqring ] ) , just using the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "if we are interested in determining which phase difference will have a phase - lock condition @xmath0 , we use the fact that @xmath42 and @xmath43 have opposite signs as well as they are maximum and minimum among all values of sine of the phase differences .",
    "the sign of the quantity @xmath62 has the same sign of the quantity @xmath80 , which is taken from the sum of equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ( eliminating for a moment the small difference between @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) .",
    "depending on the signs of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we know the signs of @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and hence the sign of @xmath62 . therefore , we count two quantities @xmath81 and @xmath82 , positive sign for @xmath83 and negative sign for the reverse .",
    "three cases will exist : first from the quantities @xmath84 and @xmath85 , one is positive and the other is negative .",
    "thus depending on the sign of @xmath86 we choose either @xmath84 or @xmath85 to be @xmath87 .",
    "second @xmath84 and @xmath85 have the same signs , then we check the minimum between @xmath88 and @xmath89 and depending on which one is the minimum , we take either @xmath84 or @xmath85 to be @xmath87 . third @xmath90 , then we take the minimum outcome of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "now we know the value of @xmath87 and its sign .",
    "therefore , we know which equation from ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) will be used to give @xmath73 .",
    "thus we specify which phase difference of index @xmath37 or @xmath39 would have @xmath0 .",
    "we tested this method on the simulations we have done and it matches the outcome of the numerical simulations .",
    "the number of oscillators in each cluster at the vicinity of @xmath10 can be determined , once we assigned the indexes @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , which , we remind the reader , are obtained from @xmath59 and @xmath60 , maximum and minimum values of the sequence @xmath48 .",
    "the size of one cluster of @xmath13 oscillators is determined by counting the difference @xmath91 and the size of the other cluster is determined as @xmath92 . similarly to the calculation of @xmath59 and @xmath60",
    ", we can determine other two quantities which are @xmath93 and @xmath94 taking into consideration the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is found that @xmath95 .",
    "these quantities are related to @xmath59 and @xmath60 by @xmath96 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath97 .",
    "the two quantities @xmath98 and @xmath99 provide a criteria to understand synchronization - desynchronization at @xmath10 . if one arrives from above @xmath10 where all oscillators are synchronized and have the same value of frequency , at @xmath10 the oscillators split into two groups of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , at @xmath10 , depending on these two quantities @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where @xmath95 . it is not necessary for @xmath13 to be equal to @xmath14 . both quantities @xmath98 and @xmath99 have opposite signs since they refer to two groups of oscillators ( two clusters ) one of them rotates with average frequency over @xmath100 and the other has an average frequency lower than @xmath100 .    comparing our findings of @xmath10 with the work of daniels et al .",
    "@xcite , our method has the advantage of finding the value of @xmath10 without performing numerical simulations once we know the set of initial frequencies @xmath5 .",
    "in addition we get the condition of synchronization - desynchronization at @xmath10 and obtain the number of oscillators in each branch in the vicinity of @xmath10 .",
    "we have analyzed the conditions of the phase differences for the onset of complete synchronization at the critical coupling strength in a kuramoto - like model with nearest neighbour coupling with periodic boundary conditions . such analysis allows us to determine the four oscillators located at the borders of the major clusters ( formed by successive oscillator ) which will meet at the critical coupling to form one cluster of all synchronized oscillators . with the help of these findings we derive the analytic expression for the critical coupling when all oscillators will have the same frequency and ,",
    "phase differences and instantaneous velocities become time independent . in addition , we are able to determine which is the phase difference , that will have a phase - lock solution @xmath0 . from the derivation",
    "we also extract the size of the clusters before complete synchronization .",
    "the analytic form of @xmath10 depends only on the initial frequencies , through the quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 , where the indexes @xmath37 and @xmath39 correspond to the borders of the clusters . the quantities @xmath59 and @xmath60 correspond to the maximum and minimum values of the sequence @xmath48 .",
    "these quantities in fact are related to the statistics of the distribution of the set of initial frequencies @xmath5 , when this sample is obtained from a gaussian distribution , as shown by strogatz and mirollo @xcite .",
    "a detailed study within this context could shine light on the behavior of @xmath10 as @xmath101 , not just for the case of a gaussian distribution , but for others .",
    "this investigation plus extension of the method to study cluster formation inside the tree will be topics of further analysis .",
    "the advantages of the study presented here is that we can determine the value of the coupling constant that will synchronize the system of coupled oscillators without carrying out numerical simulation as well as to determine the sizes of the clusters just before this happens .",
    "generalization of these results to different couplings and boundaries are under investigation and will be presented elsewhere ."
