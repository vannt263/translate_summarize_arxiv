    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are descended from the most massive o stars ( @xmath4 ) , and shed core - processed material in thick , line - driven winds at such prodigious rates ( typically 10@xmath5 yr@xmath6 ) as to affect the evolution of the core and thus the lifetime of the star , prior to ending in a supernova explosion ( meynet & maeder 2003 ) .",
    "the prototype wolf - rayet star ez cma ( hd  50896 = wr  6 in the catalogue of van der hucht 2001 ) has been studied extensively at nearly all wavelengths accessible with ground - based facilities and space observatories , to understand the extreme stellar wind properties of these rare massive stars , and how they interact with their local environment . at infrared wavelengths , the continuum opacity",
    "is principally determined by free - free scattering of electrons from helium ions , and the emergent radiation originates in the outer layers of the wind where the asymptotic velocity is reached ( e.g. , hillier et al . 1983 ) .",
    "these layers are also where critical electron densities and temperatures are reached to form fine structure lines of ne , o , s , and other elements , that are instrumental in testing evolutionary model predictions of the surface abundances during different core burning stages .",
    "elemental abundances obtained from the fine structure lines depend on the stellar parameters , particularly the mass - loss rat , which is sensitive to the degree of clumping in the wind .",
    "the role played by mid - infrared spectra , in conjunction with uv , optical , and near - ir spectroscopy , has been demonstrated for a few wn and wc stars observed with the sws ( morris et al .",
    "2000 ; dessart et al .",
    "only the brightest wr stars could be observed with the sws , for sensitivity reasons , and observations of only five wr stars produced spectra of suitable quality for modelling beyond 4.5  @xmath0 m .    in this letter we present _",
    "spitzer_-irs spectra of the prototype early wn star ez cma .",
    "we carry out an analysis of the ultraviolet to mid - ir spectroscopy , revealing stellar and wind parameters , with which ne / he and o / he abundance ratios are determined .",
    "comparisons with theoretical expectations are presented .",
    "ez cma was observed with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrometer ( described by houck et al .",
    "2004 ) on 11 november 2003 , during the science verification phase , using all four of the irs modules .",
    "the data were acquired with the spectral mapping aot , with the star observed at 3 to 5 discrete positions along the lengths ( cross - dispersed axes ) of the slits .",
    "the @xmath7 m data presented in this paper are from the short and long high ( sh and lh ) resolution modules ( @xmath8 ) , and @xmath9 m data are from the short low ( sl ) module ( @xmath10 ) , using exposure times that should produce continuum signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios of around 100 in the high resolution spectra , and 200 - 250 in the low resolution spectra .",
    "the basic calibrations were automatically carried out in the ssc pipeline , version s9.5 , and then spectra were extracted and coadded interactively , using the offline pipeline .",
    "our analysis also makes use of archival _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) short wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) spectra , optical spectrophotometry from torres - dodgen & massey ( 1988 ) , high resolution _ international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) _ ultraviolet spectrophotometry from howarth & phillips ( 1986 ) , plus _ hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( hut ) _ far - ultraviolet spectrophotometry ( schulte - ladbeck et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the unpublished sws 2.44.2  @xmath0 m spectroscopy of ez cma was obtained from the public archive , processed to the auto analysis result .",
    "further reduction to a single spectrum was carried out interactively , using sws interactive analysis routines .",
    "continuum s / n ratios are around 50 in these data . low resolution near - ir spectroscopy of hd  50896 has previously been discussed by hillier et al .",
    "we additionally use high dispersion spectroscopy of hd  50896 obtained with the eso 3.6 m cassegrain echelle spectrograph ( caspec ) , previously presented by schmutz ( 1997 ) .",
    "we adopted a distance of 1.8  kpc to hd  50896 ( howarth & schmutz 1995 ) , interstellar reddening of e(b - v)=0.1 mag ( the mean from schmutz & vacca 1991 , van der hucht 2001 ) and an atomic hydrogen column density of @xmath1120.7 @xmath12 ( howarth & phillips 1986 ) .",
    "the _ spitzer _ irs and _ iso _ sws spectroscopy of ez  cma are presented in fig .  1 together with identifications of the principal wind features .",
    "the majority of mid - ir spectral features are due to wind lines of heii , primarily the leading member in each series from heii ( 7 - 6 ) at 3.09@xmath0 m to ( 1514 ) at 34.6@xmath0 m .",
    "in addition to these , we observe fine - structure lines of [ oiv ] 25.9@xmath0 m and [ neiii ] 15.5@xmath0 m , the latter blended with heii 15.47@xmath0 m ( 15 - 13 )",
    ". there is no evidence for [ siv ] 10.5@xmath0 m in hd  50896 .",
    "the observed feature is well reproduced by a weak blend of heii 10.46@xmath0 m ( 21 - 15 ) and 10.50@xmath0 m ( 24 - 16 ) in our synthetic spectrum .",
    "to date , the majority of spectroscopic analyses of wn stars have been carried out using non - lte models that did not account for metal line blanketing or clumping ( e.g. crowther et al . 1995 , hamann et al . 1995 ) . in only a few cases",
    "have clumped , metal line blanketed models been applied to individual stars ( e.g. schmutz 1997 , morris et al .",
    "2000 , dessart et al .",
    "2000 , herald et al .",
    "such effects need to be taken into account in order to determine the fundamental parameters of wr stars ( crowther 2003 ) .    for the present study of hd  50896",
    ", we employ cmfgen ( hillier & miller 1998 ) , which solves the transfer equation in the co - moving frame subject to statistical and radiative equilibrium , assuming an expanding , spherically - symmetric , homogeneous and static atmosphere , allowing for line blanketing and clumping .",
    "the stellar radius ( @xmath13 ) is defined as the inner boundary of the model atmosphere and is located at rosseland optical depth of @xmath320 with the stellar temperature ( @xmath14 ) defined by the usual stefan - boltzmann relation .",
    "consequently , the stellar radius is much smaller than the radius of @xmath15=1 , such that the temperature depends directly on the assumed velocity law .",
    "our approach follows previous studies ( e.g. crowther et al .",
    "1995 ) , such that diagnostic optical lines of hei ( @xmath165876 ) , heii ( @xmath164686 ) plus the local continuum level allow a determination of the stellar temperature , mass - loss rate and luminosity .",
    "we were unable to employ solely mid - ir diagnostics since the irs spectrum of hd  50896 is dominated by lines of heii , with hei weak or blended .",
    "our final model atom contains h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , p , s , cl , ar , ca , cr , mn , fe and ni . in total , 1186 super levels , 4462 full levels and 45,485 non - lte transitions are simultaneously considered .",
    "we assume hydrogen is absent , such that helium makes up 98% of the atmosphere .",
    "cno abundances are varied until an optimal fit is achieved .",
    "in contrast with nitrogen and carbon , the abundance of oxygen in wn stars has proven to be rather challenging ( hillier 1988 ) .",
    "the reason is that oxygen has a much more complicated ionization stratification in their inner winds , plus diagnostic lines are located in rather observationally inaccessible regions , typically 28003400 .",
    "consequently we set oxygen ( and neon ) abundances from the fine - structure analysis .",
    "other elements are fixed at solar values ( grevesse & sauval 1998 ; asplund et al .",
    "2004 ) .",
    "we adopt a standard form of the velocity law , @xmath17 , where @xmath18=1 .",
    "in contrast , schmutz ( 1997 ) solved the hydrodynamical equation for outer wind and obtained @xmath19 with reference to the core radius .",
    "a terminal wind velocity , @xmath20 , of 1860 kms@xmath6 is obtained from the mid - ir fine structure line of [ oiv ] 25.9@xmath0 m . for comparison , prinja et al .",
    "( 1990 ) obtained 1720 kms@xmath6 from uv observations of the p cygni civ 1550  line , whilst schmutz ( 1997 ) derived 2060 kms@xmath6 from a fit to hei 1.083@xmath0 m .",
    "the mass - loss rate is actually derived as the ratio @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the volume filling factor that can be constrained by fits to the electron scattering wings of the helium line profiles ( following hillier 1991 ) .",
    "we conclude @xmath230.1 , and can definitely exclude homogeneous mass - loss in hd  50896 .",
    "in addition , the mid - ir continuum slope also reacts to different filling - factors .",

[ wr6_fit ] .",
    "overall the agreement between the spectral features and continuum are excellent from 0.0937@xmath0 m , with few major exceptions . for helium ,",
    "all lines are reproduced better than 20% , with the exception of a few mid - ir lines , namely heii",
    "3.091@xmath0 m ( 7 - 6 ) , 13.12@xmath0 m ( 11 - 10 ) and 22.17@xmath0 m ( 13 - 12 ) . since fine - structure lines are not included in our synthetic spectrum , it is apparent that [ neiii ] is a non - negligible contributor to the 15.5@xmath0 m feature , the 25.9@xmath0 m line is dominated by [ oiv ] and there is no obvious identification for the lines at 20.7@xmath0 m or 36.6@xmath0 m ( the latter is not [ neiii ] 36.01@xmath0 m ) .",
    "the stellar parameters derived for the wn4b star are presented in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "we estimate elemental abundances of n / he=2@xmath30 and c / he=5@xmath2 by number .",
    "hillier ( 1988 ) previously estimated n / he@xmath31 , n / c@xmath314 and o / n@xmath323 for ez  cma , the only previous study to attempt cno abundance determinations . the only recent study of ez  cma allowing for blanketing and wind clumping was by schmutz ( 1997 ) , whose results we also include in table  [ table1 ] .",
    "schmutz ( 1997 ) approached the incorporation of line blanketing in a different manner from the present approach .",
    "a monte carlo sampling technique was adopted , allowing for the effect of a much more thorough line opacity at the expense of full consistency in the radiative transfer problem , via the use of approximate ionization and excitation for metal species .",
    "in addition , schmutz adopted a heii ly@xmath33 @xmath16303 photon loss mechanism with a particular parameter .",
    "such a mechanism is intrinsic to the present analysis without the requirement of a parameterization , providing spectral lines adjacent to heii @xmath16303.78 are accounted for in the calculation . consequently the following metal lines within @xmath3100 kms@xmath6 of ly@xmath33 are included ",

    "agreement between the two approaches is reasonable , given the differences in approach and choice of diagnostics . in both solutions , stellar luminosities ( and hence bolometric corrections )",
    "are significantly higher than previous non - lte studies ( e.g. hamann et al .",
    "1995 ) , although schmutz ( 1997 ) obtained a rather higher bolometric luminosity , due to a combination of his photon loss mechanism and more complete line opacity , whilst clumping corrected mass - loss rates are much lower . consequently , the derived momentum ratio is found to be @xmath34 = 7 , versus 3070 in earlier studies .",
    "the agreement in mass - loss rate is consistent with the claimed precision of 0.1 dex achieved by schmutz ( 1997 ) , of relevance to the determination of elemental abundances to follow .",
    "we present the fine - structure lines of [ neiii ] 15.5@xmath0 m and [ oiv ] @xmath1625.9@xmath0 m in fig .",
    "[ wr6_fs ] , including the predicted fractional contributions from [ neiii ] and [ oiv ] ( dotted lines ) obtained from , respectively , the red line profile of [ neiii ] which does not overlap with heii ( 1513 ) , and the non - lte predicted heii ( 2319 ) strength .",
    "the observed line fluxes of each blend is presented in table  [ finestructure ] .",
    "sources of atomic data are given in dessart et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for [ neiii ] , and hayes & nussbaumer ( 1983 ) and blum & pradhan ( 1992 ) for [ oiv ] .",
    "we have determined elemental abundances for these ions using the numerical techniques introduced by barlow et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , and adapted to account for a clumped wind by dessart et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and morris et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . with regard to clumping",
    ", we admit that the volume filling factor in the outer wind may be considerably different than that derived from optical and near - ir recombination lines ( runacres & owocki 2002 ) .",
    "the numerical expression for the ion number fraction , @xmath35 , in a clumped medium ( with volume filling factor @xmath22 ) is ( in cgs units ) @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the stellar distance , @xmath38 is the line flux of the transition with energy @xmath39 between upper level @xmath40 and lower level @xmath41 , with transition probability @xmath42 . @xmath43 ( = 1.008 ) and @xmath44 ( = 14000k ) are the electron number density and temperature in the line - forming region , and the mean molecular weight is @xmath0 ( = 4.04 ) for ez  cma , with @xmath45 the mass of the hydrogen atom .",
    "the integral part , @xmath46 , is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fractional population of the upper level .",
    "following this technique , we derive ne@xmath49/he = 1.2@xmath50 and o@xmath51/he = 4.2@xmath2 by number , _ assuming _ a fractional contribution of 67% and 85% to the observed 15.5@xmath0 m and 25.9@xmath0 m lines respectively . if we were to neglect the predicted heii contribution to the observed spectral features , we would obtain ne@xmath49/he = 1.8@xmath1 and o@xmath51/he = 4.8@xmath2 from this method . applying the same technique based on the schmutz ( 1997 ) spectroscopic results ,",
    "we would derive slightly lower abundances of ne@xmath49/he = 1.11.4@xmath1 and o@xmath51/he = 3.54.1@xmath2 .",
    "of course , one needs to account for potential contributions from unseen ionization stages .",
    "our model atmosphere identifies the following dominant ions at the outer model radius of @xmath3200@xmath13 , where @xmath52@xmath539 , namely he@xmath54 , c@xmath51 , n@xmath51 , o@xmath51 , ne@xmath49 , mg@xmath49 , si@xmath55 , p@xmath55 , s@xmath55 , cl@xmath55 , ar@xmath56 , ca@xmath55 , cr@xmath55 , mn@xmath57 , fe@xmath56 and ni@xmath57 .",
    "the dominant ionization state in wn stars at large radii is predicted to be higher than for wc stars , despite similar stellar temperatures , since the effects of metal coolants is far less ( hillier 1988 , 1989 ) .",
    "are these predictions consistent for the physical conditions at even lower densities of @xmath52@xmath535 where the fine - structure lines form ?",
    "the absence of [ siv ] 10.5@xmath0 m is consistent with a dominant ionization stage of s@xmath55 for ez  cma , whilst [ neii ] 12.8@xmath0 m line is absent , so ne@xmath58 ne@xmath49 , in agreement with expectation .",
    "the contribution of ne@xmath51 is uncertain , although it has a rather high ionization potential ( ip = 97ev ) , such that we assume ne / he@xmath59 ne@xmath49/he = 1.21.8 @xmath1 , depending on the contribution by heii .",
    "this is in reasonable agreement with the revised solar ne abundance ( asplund et al .",
    "2004 ) of ne / he=2@xmath1 , adjusted for the h - depleted atmosphere of an early wn star .",

    "nevertheless , from the consistency with other relevant ions of ne and s , we adopt o / he @xmath74 o@xmath51/he = 4.24.8@xmath6610@xmath75 . from our nitrogen abundance",
    "derived above , we find n / o=4048 by number .",
    "what is the expected oxygen abundance in a h - free wn star ? from the spectroscopic analysis above , we derive n / c=40 by number .",

    "we present _ spitzer _ irs spectroscopy for ez  cma ( hd  50896 wn4b ) , the first early wn star to be observed spectroscopically in the mid - ir .",
    "in addition to numerous stellar wind lines of heii , fine structure lines of [ neiii ] and [ oiv ] are revealed , permitting an estimate of the asymptotic wind velocity , @xmath31860 kms@xmath6 , plus elemental abundances .",
    "we carry our a spectroscopic analysis of hd  50896 , allowing for metal line blanketing and wind clumping , revealing generally excellent agreement with the irs spectroscopy , plus stellar parameters supporting the earlier study of schmutz ( 1997 ) , based on an alternative line blanketing technique .",
    "we also derive n / he@xmath77 by number , with n / c@xmath340 . from the derived clumped mass - loss rate , we obtain ne@xmath49/he=1.2@xmath1 , allowing for the contribution by neighboring heii wind lines , in comparison with ne / he=2@xmath1 for a severely h - depleted environment , adjusted for the recent downward revision in the solar neon abundance by asplund et al .",
