    "there remains disagreement about the local value of @xmath0 depending on the distance indicator used to measure it , which hints the discrepancy with _",
    "planck _ could be the result of systematic errors .",
    "@xcite calibrated the sne ia distances with three indicators : distance to ngc 4258 based on a megamaser measurement , parallax measurements to milk way cepheids ( mwc ) and cepheids observations and a revised distance to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "contrarily , calibrating the sne ia with the tip of red - giant branch , @xcite provides @xmath0 @xmath9 63.7 @xmath10 2.3 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "this shows how crucial is the first - step calibration in the distance ladder to measure @xmath0 .",
    "however , there are several local @xmath0 measurements with higher values .",
    "@xcite found @xmath0 @xmath9 75.4 @xmath10 2.9 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 by using cepheids in m31 . with a mid - infrared calibration for the cepheids",

    "some of these are over 4@xmath11 away from the cmb - derived value .",
    "[ figh0 ] for a plot of different measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "0.1 in    a variety of different physical effects could explain such a discrepancy .",
    "it could just be cosmic variance : as we can observe the universe from only one position , we are not able to realize the global parameters from the local parameters , as in the local expansion rate for instance . if we live in an locally underdense region , a `` hubble bubble '' , a higher value for @xmath0 is obtained compared to the global value .",
    "this effect was carefully addressed by @xcite through a modelling of the statistics of matter distribution which provides the distribution of the gravitational potential at the observer .",
    "the outcome is that cosmic variance can alleviate the tension , but a complete elimination requires a very rare fluctuation @xcite .",
    "another way to look at the problem is to consider that the discrepancy may indicate new physics , such as massive neutrinos @xcite , or alternative dark energy models @xcite .",
    "recently , some analyses were performed trying to identify sources of systematic errors in order to remove or alleviate the tension .",
    "for example , by using only the geometric maser distance to ngc 4258 of @xcite as an anchor , @xcite revisited @xcite analysis and derived @xmath12 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , while combining with lmc and mwc anchors the value is @xmath13 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , alleviating the tension .",
    "the _ planck _",
    "data were also reanalysed by @xcite , where it was claimed that the 217 ghz @xmath14 217 ghz detector is responsible for some part of the tension .",
    "their new hubble constant without the 217 ghz @xmath14 217 ghz detector is slightly higher : @xmath15 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 .    with so many alternatives",
    ", progress can be achieved by developing new ways to address the issue .",
    "we point out here that @xmath1 data which are not calibrated on a @xmath0 estimate can be extrapolated to z=0 to provide an independent measurement of the global @xmath0 . here , the hubble function is reconstructed in order to derive @xmath0 from 19 @xmath1 measurements of passively evolving galaxies as cosmic chronometers @xcite .",
    "many of these are at relatively moderate and high redshifts so intrinsically probe the global value for @xmath0 rather than the local one .",
    "we use gaussian processes ( gp ) , which is a non - parametric method , to obtain the value of the hubble constant in a completely cosmological model - independent way , which is in principle not affected by the local systematics .",
    "we show the value of the hubble constant derived in this way is lower than the standard local measurements .",
    "we obtain @xmath0 @xmath9 @xmath16 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 @xmath6 , in agreement with the cmb - inferred value",
    ". a better understanding of systematic errors , especially the adopted stellar population synthesis model , is required : we show that to improve this result a big effort is necessary to decrease the errors substantially in future , and a focus on precision is worthier than the number of data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ conc ] with the conclusions .",
    "a gaussian _ distribution _ is a distribution over random variables , while a gaussian _ process _ is a distribution over functions .",
    "this allows one to reconstruct a function from data without assuming a parametrisation for it .",
    "here we use gapp ( gaussian processes in python ) @xcite in order to reconstruct the hubble parameter as a function of the redshift from which we can infer @xmath0 .",
    "this method has been applied for several purposes , for example the reconstruction of the equation of state of dark energy @xcite and to perform null tests of the concordance model @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction is given by a mean function with gaussian error bands , where the function values at different points @xmath2 and @xmath17 are connected through a covariance function @xmath18 ( see @xcite for a discussion of choices of covariance functions ) .",
    "this covariance function depends on a set of hyperparameters . here , as we expect that the hubble parameter and all its derivatives to be smooth , we consider the general purpose squared exponential ( sq . exp . ) covariance function which is given by @xmath19 in the above equation we have two hyperparameters , the first @xmath20 is related to typical changes in the function value while the second @xmath21 is related to the distance one needs to move in input space before the function value changes significantly .",
    "we follow the steps of @xcite and determine the maximum likelihood value for @xmath20 and @xmath21 in order to obtain the value of the function . in this way",
    ", we are able to reconstruct the hubble parameter as a function of the redshift from @xmath1 measurements . we discuss in sect .",
    "[ sect_cov ] the impact of different covariance functions on our results .",
    "in order to compare the results provided by non - parametric methods with standard analyses , we also consider two parametric models .",
    "first of all , we take a flat xcdm model , where the universe is composed by dark matter and a fluid @xmath22 with equation of state @xmath23 , where the hubble parameter is given by    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the matter density parameter today . when @xmath26 this is the concordance @xmath27cdm model which we consider separately . in order to derive @xmath0 for the parametric models ,",
    "we apply standard statistical procedures based on maximum likelihood methods .",
    "we use 19 @xmath1 measurements @xcite from passively evolving galaxies as cosmic chronometers to derive the value of @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] presents the results for the non - parametric approach adopted in this work .",
    "we also plot the @xmath1 measurements with their respective errorbars .",
    "the blue solid line refers to the reconstruction with gapp , with the shaded contours designating the @xmath28 errors .",
    "when extrapolated to redshift @xmath3 , we obtain @xmath29 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "note that this value is completely independent of a cosmological model , which makes it complementary but consistent with the _ planck _ value which is derived within the @xmath27cdm model . in this way , our result can also be used to shed light in the whole cosmological model .",
    "this result goes in the direction of a model - independent approach with sne ia which also prefers lower values for @xmath0 @xcite .    as a means to compare the non - parametric with standard parametric analyses , a flat @xmath27cdm model and a flat xcdm are also considered .",
    "the hubble constant is found to be @xmath30 km",
    "s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 @xmath6 for the flat @xmath27cdm model and @xmath31 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 @xmath6 for xcdm .",
    "the bigger error for the xcdm case is derived as a consequence of the inclusion of an extra parameter .",
    "the mean values are higher compared to the non - parametric approach , and in closer agreement with locally measured values , but also in agreement with the non - parametric result .",
    "table [ table1 ] summarizes the constraints for @xmath0 with @xmath28 errors .",
    "all methods prefer values for @xmath0 below 70 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , in contrast with some local determinations of @xmath0 .    0.1 in    .@xmath0 constraints from 19 @xmath1 measurements .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]      some tests were performed in order to evaluate the robustness of the result .",
    "we split our analysis searching for three effects : ( i ) the impact of the covariance function in gapp , ( ii ) a possible presence of outliers driving @xmath0 for lower values and ( iii ) systematic errors from the stellar population synthesis ( sps ) models .",
    "the freedom in the gp approach comes in the covariance function .",
    "while in traditional parametric analyses we choose a model to characterise what is our prior belief about the function in which we are interested , with gp we ascribe in the covariance function our priors about the expected function properties ( e.g. smoothness , correlation scales etc . ) .",
    "since we expect the hubble parameter and its derivatives to be smooth , the squared exponential covariance function was selected which is infinitely differentiable   this implies that functions drawn from the process are also infinitely differentiable .",
    "however , we considered other covariance functions to see how the results are affected . in order to do so",
    ", we considered three covariance functions from the matrn family , namely the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( see @xcite for definitions and further discussion ) .",
    "writing @xmath35 , each matrn function is @xmath36 times differentiable as are functions drawn from it , and the squared exponential is recovered for @xmath37 . increasing @xmath38 increases the width of the covariance function near the peak implying stronger correlations from nearby points for a fixed correlation length @xmath39 .",
    "the results are shown in table [ table1 ] , where we see slightly higher values are derived for @xmath0 , together with slightly larger errors , for smaller @xmath38 .",
    "in fact , for the matrn@xmath40 the tension with local @xmath0 disappears , although the result remains in fully agreement with _",
    "planck_. interestingly , although there is some shift , the errors are relatively independent of the covariance function choice , especially when compared to the ones derived when one increases the number of parameters in parametric analyses ( the error more than doubles when allowing for @xmath41 to be free , compared to fixing it to @xmath42 ) , showing that gp provide very stable results within different reasonable assumptions .      we checked if the high - redshift data were pivoting down the value of @xmath0 to smaller values . to do so , we removed all data points with redshifts greater than 1 , but again the results were completely consistent with the full sample , @xmath43 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , thus not removing the tension . by removing low - redshift points ,",
    "first and second or third and fourth , again the results did not change significantly , with @xmath44 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and @xmath45 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "we note that the points with smaller errors dominate the final error budget , as confirmed also by the analysis done in sect .",
    "we also removed point by point in the analysis .",
    "for the first 17 points , the results changed slightly , with a mean value between 64 and 65 and errors between 4 and 5 .",
    "conversely , the high - redshift points showed the biggest departure once removed , with values @xmath46 ( 18th out ) and @xmath47 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 ( 19th out ) .",
    "higher values are derived and the error blows up , although in agreement with the full sample .",
    "this shows how @xmath0 is sensitive to high - redshift values , where more data points in this redshift region might help to mitigate possible sytematic errors due to outliers .",
    "one of the possible main sources of systematic errors in @xmath1 measurements comes from the adopted sps model .",
    "the 19 points used here were derived with @xcite sps model ( bc03 ) . on the other hand , recently @xcite calculated @xmath1 for eight measurements considering bc03 and another sps model from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mastro ) .",
    "we performed the reconstruction with gapp for this subset with both sps models .",
    "for bc03 we derived @xmath0 in the range @xmath48 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , in good agreement with the full sample . on the contrary ,",
    "the analysis with mastro provided @xmath49 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , in disagreement with _ planck _ and in good agreement with the value of @xcite . therefore ,",
    "even with only eight data points , we identify the sps model as the main concern for our results .",
    "another independent measurement for @xmath1 is given by baryon acoustic oscillations ( baos ) .",
    "currently , there are 7 measurements from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . combining with the other measurements , for gapp ( sq",
    "we got @xmath50 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 , for a flat @xmath27cdm model @xmath51 km s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 and for a flat xcdm model @xmath52 , all values consistent with _",
    "planck_. however , there are some drawbacks when using the bao data .",
    "first , these data are not model independent .",
    "they are based on the @xmath27cdm model to study the correlation functions and transform them to the @xmath1 values .",
    "moreover , generally what is inferred is the combination @xmath53 , @xmath54 standing for the sound horizon whose value is given by _",
    "@xcite . also important",
    "is the point raised by @xcite warning that their values of @xmath1 are derived and so they should not be used to test models .",
    "since the current errors do not allow a final decision about the value of @xmath0 , our next step is to study whether future data can settle the issue .",
    "the procedure to analyse how future data can improve the determination of @xmath0 is split in two ways .",
    "first , we consider how the increase of data points of same quality can change the constraints .",
    "second , the errors for @xmath1 are shrunk and a comparison is made between the number of data and their quality .    the current errors for @xmath1 measurements grow with redshift a few percent up to around 15 per cent . assuming that future data will provide measurements with the same errors , we update the method of @xcite to predict future data based on the recent measurements from @xcite . a value for @xmath1 is generated by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are respectively the simulated and fiducial values for the hubble parameter at redshift @xmath2 , and @xmath58 is a random number gaussianly distributed with mean zero and variance @xmath59 . to estimate @xmath59 , the uncertainties of the observational points",
    "are restricted by two straight lines : @xmath60 and @xmath61 , with two `` outliers '' removed since they were not following the trend of the errors . assuming that the errors of future data will be between the two lines",
    ", one can expect the mean line of the error to be @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , the error of the simulated point is drawn from a gaussianly distributed random variable @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is chosen to assure the error is within @xmath65 and @xmath66 with 95.4% probability .    0.1 in    figure [ fig2 ] presents",
    "the expected future errors from considering data are equally spaced in the interval @xmath67 .",
    "we present the expected error on @xmath0 from simulations with 64 , 128 , and 256 data points .",
    "these numbers were chosen because with 64 @xmath1 measurements of same quality as today one can achieve the same constraints given by current sne ia @xcite .",
    "the black crosses represent the errors with the gapp reconstruction , the red dots for the flat xcdm model and the blue triangles for the flat @xmath27cdm model .",
    "the first panel in the left shows the behavior of future data with the same quality as today , and the others show the trend for smaller errors for the @xmath1 data , of 10% , 5% , and 3% ( see @xcite for an observational program to achieve such values ) .",
    "some conclusions can be made from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] :    * for future data with the same quality as today gapp performs very well , with errors smaller than the ones obtained with a flat xcdm model . *",
    "current quality data provide better constraints to @xmath0 than a constant error of 10% in the whole redshift range , showing that lower redshift objects with higher precision compensate the low quality data at high redshifts . * for higher precision measurements gapp and the xcdm model provide the same constraints , showing that a non - parametric approach is powerful to study cosmological data . *",
    "improvement in precision is more important than increasing the number of data of poorer quality .",
    "we have applied gapp , a non - parametric smoothing method based on gaussian processes , to 19 @xmath1 measurements in order to constrain the hubble constant @xmath0 .",
    "this method does not rely on a cosmological model , so its results can be used to infer the impact of systematic errors as well as the underlying cosmological framework .",
    "we have obtained @xmath0 to be @xmath16 km",
    "s@xmath5 mpc@xmath5 @xmath6 , a value which is in agreement with _ planck _ , but in disagreement with local measurements .",
    "this supports the notion that either there are unidentified systematic errors in the local @xmath0 data , or the local value is indeed different from the global value . a better comprehension of systematic errors , especially a thorough analysis of the impact of sps models , can improve the robustness of our results .",
