    "to model continuum mechanics phenomena , different models of turbulence are employed ( see , e.g. , @xcite among others ) . in terms of practical use , emphasis is on simple mathematical models of turbulence , which , on the one hand , are not much more complex in comparison with models for laminar flows , and on the other hand , reproduce the basic features of turbulent regimes of liquid and gas flows .",
    "nowadays , non - local applied mathematical models based on using fractional derivatives in time and space are actively discussed @xcite .",
    "many models in applied physics , biology , hydrology and finance , involve both sub - diffusion ( fractional in time ) and supper - diffusion ( fractional in space ) operators .",
    "supper - diffusion problems are treated as evolutionary problems with a fractional power of an elliptic operator .",
    "such an anomalous diffusion model is used in @xcite to describe turbulent flows . in the work @xcite , a turbulent diffusion in the reynolds equations for the mean velocity",
    "is governed by the fractional laplacian .",
    "the development of this approach is hindered by the lack of simple and robust numerical algorithms for solving boundary value problems for equations with fractional powers . in the best case ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , investigations are restricted to simple one - dimensional in space models .    for solving problems with fractional powers of elliptic operators , we can apply finite volume and finite element methods oriented to using arbitrary domains and irregular computational grids @xcite . the numerical implementation involves the matrix function - vector multiplication . for such problems , different approaches @xcite are available .",
    "problems of using krylov subspace methods with the lanczos approximation when solving systems of linear equations associated with the fractional elliptic equations are discussed in @xcite . a comparative analysis of the contour integral method , the extended krylov subspace method , and the preassigned poles and interpolation nodes method for solving space - fractional reaction - diffusion equations is presented in @xcite .",
    "the simplest variant is associated with the explicit construction of the solution using the known eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the elliptic operator with diagonalization of the corresponding matrix @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all these approaches demonstrates too high computational complexity for multidimensional problems .",
    "we have proposed @xcite a computational algorithm for solving an equation with fractional powers of elliptic operators on the basis of a transition to a pseudo - parabolic equation . for the auxiliary cauchy problem ,",
    "the standard two - level schemes are applied .",
    "the computational algorithm is simple for practical use , robust , and applicable to solving a wide class of problems . a small number of time steps is required to find a solution .",
    "this computational algorithm for solving equations with fractional powers of operators is promising when considering transient problems .    to implement numerically a space - fractional model of turbulent fluid flow",
    ", we must take into account a multi - term structure of the problem operator .",
    "namely , here one term is the standard elliptic operator ( normal diffusion ) , whereas the second term is a fractional power of an elliptic operator ( anomalous diffusion ) . for solving such non - classical problems",
    ", it seems natural to apply iterative methods with an appropriate choice of preconditioners @xcite .    in this paper , for predicting a steady - state turbulent flow in a duct , we apply a model with a turbulent space - fractional diffusion . to solve",
    "numerically this problem with the multi - term diffusion , we employ the iterative method of conjugate gradients , where the problem with normal diffusion is solved at each iteration to construct a preconditioner . for solving the problem with the fractional laplacian , a pseudo - parabolic equation is used .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , a mathematical model with the fractional laplacian",
    "is introduced to describe a turbulent flow in a rectangular duct .",
    "the discrete problem and computational algorithm are discussed in section 3 .",

    "motion of an incompressible fluid is governed by the navier - stokes equations : @xmath0 @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the density , @xmath3 denotes the pressure , @xmath4 stands for the velocity vector , and @xmath5 is the fluid viscosity .    to obtain the reynolds equations for turbulent flows",
    "@xcite , the velocity and pressure @xmath6 are decomposed into the sum of the mean flow components @xmath7 and fluctuating components @xmath8 . substituting this decomposition into ( [ 1 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] ) , we arrive at the reynolds equations written in the following coordinate - wise representation ( @xmath9 ) : @xmath10 @xmath11 a rans model of turbulence is defined by a particular formulation for the reynolds stress tensor @xmath12 .    for the space - fractional model , we have @xmath13 here the coefficient @xmath14 is treated as the eddy ( turbulent ) diffusivity . in the work @xcite",

    "is observed in the critical region near duct walls .",
    "relatively large discrepancies take place only in the central zone of the duct cross - section .",
