    "<S> shear thickening , an increase of viscosity with shear rate , is a ubiquitous phenomena in suspended materials that has implications for broad technological applications . </S>",
    "<S> controlling this thickening behavior remains a major challenge and has led to empirical strategies ranging from altering the particle surfaces and shape to modifying the solvent properties . </S>",
    "<S> however , none of these methods allow for tuning of flow properties during shear itself . here </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that by strategic imposition of a high - frequency and low - amplitude shear perturbation orthogonal to the primary shearing flow , we can largely eradicate shear thickening . </S>",
    "<S> the orthogonal shear effectively becomes a regulator for controlling thickening in the suspension , allowing the viscosity to be reduced by up to two decades on demand . in a separate setup , we show that such effects can be induced by simply agitating the sample transversely to the primary shear direction . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the ability of in situ manipulation of shear thickening paves a route towards creating materials whose mechanical properties can be controlled .    </S>",
    "<S> the viscosity of a densely packed suspension of particles can increase radically when sheared beyond a critical stress  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this thickening behavior has been exploited in technological applications ranging from vehicle traction control to flexible spacesuits that protect astronauts from micrometeorite impacts  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it may also lead to flow problems such as pipe blockage during industrial extrusion processes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> shear thickening has generally been considered an inherent material property  @xcite , rather than as a response that can be tuned . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> suspension process design is often constrained within tight bounds to avoid thickening  @xcite , while the applications of such flow behavior are limited by a lack of tunability .    to design our control method </S>",
    "<S> , we take advantage of the underlying shear thickening mechanisms that have been revealed recently . </S>",
    "<S> experiments and simulations have shown that when the stress applied to a suspension of micron - sized particles exceeds a critical value , the particle - particle interaction switches from lubricated to frictional , enhancing resistance to flow  @xcite . the stress is transmitted through shear - induced force chains , which arise from frictional particle contacts  @xcite , aligned along the compressive axis . </S>",
    "<S> such chains are fragile  @xcite and are constantly broken and rebuilt during steady shear . </S>",
    "<S> this fragility paradigm asserts that these stress - transmitting chains are themselves a product of the stress , with a finite chain - assembly time required following startup or perturbations to the flow direction  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these insights suggest a strategy for controlling thickening . for perturbations slower than chain assembly </S>",
    "<S> , contact rearrangement is sufficiently fast that force chains remain aligned with the instantaneous net compressive axis . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , for perturbations faster than the assembly time , chains can not reach compatibility with the instantaneous net compressive axis , but occupy a partially - assembled transient state , illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the alignment of the perturbed or tilted chain deviates from the net compressive axis and it no longer transmits stresses effectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus it should be possible to precisely regulate the thickening behavior by applying appropriate lateral perturbations .    </S>",
    "<S> to that end we design a _ biaxial _ </S>",
    "<S> shear protocol that uses an orthogonal flow perturbation to interfere with force chains induced by a primary shearing flow . </S>",
    "<S> our strategy is to maximize the perturbation influence so the force chains usually responsible for thickening can not establish fully . </S>",
    "<S> we conduct biaxial rheometry experimentally and numerically , mapping the response of a hard - sphere suspension as the perturbation rate and amplitude are systematically varied . by integrating our knowledge of the force chain alignment , mechanical instability and direct link to the viscosity , we show how this strategy can be optimized . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on _ discontinuous _ shear thickening suspensions , as their vast viscosity variations make them most problematic to the engineer  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that through suitable regulation , the suspension viscosity at a fixed flow rate may be reduced by up to two decades in an active and controlled manner . </S>",
    "<S> we finally demonstrate the wide utility of the technique using a simpler flow regulation set up .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htp ]    the biaxial rheometry experiment is performed using a double - wall couette geometry that has an outer cup driven continuously by an underneath motor , and an inner bob attached to an oscillating shaft  @xcite . a simplified schematic and coordinate definition are shown in fig .  [ figure1](b ) . the continuous primary flow in the @xmath0 plane along the @xmath1 direction , at controlled rate @xmath2 , constantly induces force chains , sets the initial shear thickening state , and probes the parallel viscosity , @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> concurrently , an orthogonal superimposed perturbation ( osp ) comprising oscillatory flow in the @xmath4 plane along the @xmath5 direction perturbs the suspension by imposing a deformation @xmath6 with rate @xmath7 , and simultaneously probes its orthogonal complex viscosity , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> given the employed couette cell dimension , we approximate the primary flow as a uniaxial shear in parallel plate geometry . </S>",
    "<S> further details about the geometry and osp calibration can be found in method and si .    following the above reasoning </S>",
    "<S> , we take the primary shear timescale @xmath9 and the osp period @xmath10 as proxies for chain - assembly and perturbation times , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we fix the primary shear rate at @xmath11 s@xmath12 , where the suspension is normally strongly thickened ( see si ) , and conduct an osp frequency sweep at a fixed strain amplitude @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the evolutions of @xmath3 and @xmath8 are given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1](c ) .    at low frequencies </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 rad / s ( blue area , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1](c ) ) , @xmath3 and @xmath8 exhibit plateaus that match the original thickening viscosity @xmath15 pa.s , for @xmath16 ( see si ) . in this regime , </S>",
    "<S> the primary flow renews the force chains rapidly so that they are always compatible with the net compressive axis , and their alignment appears to adapt instantly to the osp flow . </S>",
    "<S> this instantaneous adaptation gives rise to an isotropic and unaffected thickening behaviour ( see si for an analytical derivation ) . </S>",
    "<S> as the frequency increases to 2 rad / s @xmath17 rad / s ( green area ) , we find that the osp viscosity @xmath8 decays slightly , while the primary value @xmath3 remains relatively constant ( within 7% ) . </S>",
    "<S> the decay in @xmath8 suggests that the osp flow deforms or tilts existing force chains more quickly than they are replaced by new ones , while the unchanged @xmath3 suggests the tilted chains remain largely intact . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we observe a substantial drop in both @xmath3 and @xmath8 at even higher frequencies @xmath18 rad / s implying significant breakage of force chains and dissolution of the flow induced contact network . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , this result is consistent with our above interpretation of the fragile , marginally stable nature of the force chain network , and reaffirms the link between the stress bearing capability of the chains , and the viscosity of the suspension  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> [ htp ]    to further elucidate the roles being played by the primary and osp flows , we repeat the frequency sweep measurement at six different @xmath19 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> we normalize the osp shear rate magnitude by the primary rate @xmath20 ) , and find that all @xmath3 and @xmath8 data , for @xmath21 5% , collapse onto two master curves ( blue and red dots , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the onset of the chain breaking regime occurs at @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> this scaling suggests that the force chain response , whether they instantly adapt to the osp flow , tilt , or break , is determined by the competition between @xmath23 and @xmath24 . while @xmath24 indicates how frequently force chains reform , @xmath23 dictates how rapidly the osp flow perturbs these structures . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath25 directly governs the viscosity reduction of a biaxially sheared sample . for large @xmath26 ( @xmath275% ) , we observe a deviation from the master curves , suggesting a possible reentrant thickening arising when chains induced by the osp flow emerge . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude , therefore , that for sufficiently large @xmath28 and sufficiently small @xmath26 , our orthogonal flow perturbation disrupts the conventional shear - induced contact network , inhibiting friction - mediated force chains and mitigating shear thickening . </S>",
    "<S> the extent of this mitigation may be set using @xmath29 as a control parameter , allowing precise _ regulation _ of the viscosity of dense suspensions .    to clarify the detailed microstructural rearrangements leading to the observed measurements </S>",
    "<S> we use numerical simulations , explicitly resolving the trajectories and interactions of suspended , bidisperse spheres ( diameter ratio 1:1.4 ) using a classical discrete element code  @xcite enhanced with the recently established critical load model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hydrodynamic forces are approximated as pairwise lubrication interactions ( viscosity @xmath30 ) between neighboring particles , while particle contacts are treated as linear springs with friction appearing above a critical normal force . </S>",
    "<S> the fixed - volume fraction ( 55% ) , periodic , cartesian simulation cell can be deformed to simulate steady shear in a primary direction with a small amplitude oscillation in the orthogonal direction . </S>",
    "<S> with respect to the illustration in fig  [ figure1](e ) , primary flow ( blue arrow ) is in the @xmath31 plane , along the @xmath32 direction , and osp flow ( red arrows ) is in the @xmath33 plane , along the @xmath5 direction . </S>",
    "<S> full details and discussion of model assumptions are given in si .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimental flow measurements are repeated computationally with consistent results , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1](e ) . </S>",
    "<S> the force chain alignment is interrogated in the three identified regimes , instant adaptation , chain tilting , and chain breaking . in all regimes , </S>",
    "<S> the chains lie mainly along the compressive axis of the primary shear flow , but are subtly shifted out of the @xmath31 plane by the osp flow . to quantify these deviations , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate a fabric tensor @xmath34 capturing the particle contact configuration  @xcite , where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) is the unit vector between particles @xmath37 and @xmath38 , while @xmath39 denote the coordinate indices and @xmath40 denotes the average over all neighboring particles . </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath41 as the angle between the force chains and @xmath42-axis , when projected to @xmath43 , fig  [ figure2]a ( left inset ) , which remains small , @xmath44 , throughout . </S>",
    "<S> chains inclined towards the compressive quadrant of the osp flow ( see right inset , fig  [ figure2]a ) have positive @xmath45 for positive @xmath46 .    </S>",
    "<S> representative lissajous curves of @xmath47 for the three regimes are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , for time - varying osp strain @xmath48 . for low osp rates @xmath49 , newly formed force chains always align with the net compressive axis dictated by the instantaneous combined flow , so @xmath45 is in phase with the time - varying osp _ </S>",
    "<S> strain rate _ , @xmath50 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](a ) , generating isotropic thickening as reported in fig .  [ figure1](d )  and  ( e ) </S>",
    "<S> . for @xmath51 , the time scales for the osp and primary flows are comparable , so it is expected that chains are tilted before they can rearrange . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we find that chain alignment is antiphase to the osp _ </S>",
    "<S> strain _ </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath52 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that rather than adapting to the instantaneous flow rate , existing force chains are instead tilted affinely by the transverse deformation ( strain ) and occupy the extensional quadrant of the osp flow while @xmath53 , as sketched in fig  [ figure1]a ( right panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the osp rate dominates @xmath54 , the affine deformation caused by the transverse flow is fast enough to break these tilted force chains more rapidly than the primary flow is able to sustain or re - establish them . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , new contacts may be formed by the osp flow in its compressive quadrant . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the chain alignment is in phase with the osp strain @xmath55 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the implication of the final curve is striking . in the chain breaking regime , the thickening becomes solely governed by the strain amplitude of the osp flow . </S>",
    "<S> we summarize the chain alignment behavior by plotting the phase lag @xmath56 between @xmath45 and @xmath48 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> since the shear thickened viscosity directly arises from frictional particle contacts  @xcite , we expect that the evolution of the force chain response with increasing @xmath25 is accompanied by a reduction in particle contacts . to verify this , we calculate the time - averaged per - particle coordination number @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath58 collapses in a similar fashion to the measured viscosity , and starts to decay around @xmath59 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](e ) . indeed , </S>",
    "<S> plotting @xmath3 versus @xmath57 we recover a simple relationship @xmath60 , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure2](f ) . </S>",
    "<S> when no particle contact is formed , @xmath3 corresponds to the viscosity purely arising from the interparticle hydrodynamic interactions  @xcite . as @xmath57 increases , @xmath3 rises and brings more particles into contact , which in turn produces a higher viscosity . </S>",
    "<S> overall , these simulations reaffirm the bulk rheological effect of the orthogonal perturbation and reveal the microstructural mechanism by which the osp flow can manipulate the force chains to ultimately eradicate the frictional contacts responsible for shear thickening .    </S>",
    "<S> [ h ]    we construct a summary phase diagram recapitulating our strategy for tuning shear thickening , giving experimental and simulated primary viscosities as functions of @xmath19 and @xmath61 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3](a ) and ( b ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> when an osp flow is applied , its shear rate @xmath62 determines the force chain behavior and the state of thickening in the suspension . </S>",
    "<S> the force chain behavior shows a transition from instant adaptation , chain tilting , to chain breaking as the osp flow rate increases . </S>",
    "<S> when the osp flow rate is even higher , however , the osp flow may start to induce force chains by itself for sufficiently large @xmath26 . a reentrant thickening behavior </S>",
    "<S> is then observed , as indicated by the curved contours and red region in the upper right corners of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> [ h ]    the orthogonal flow induced viscosity reduction allows us to drive the material at a higher speed with the same amount of driving force . in some practical cases , our biaxial protocol or </S>",
    "<S> a comparable oscillatory perturbation should be able to thin the suspension and effectively increase the flow processing speed . </S>",
    "<S> we test this prediction in a dense cornstarch suspension ( solid fraction @xmath63 40 wt % )  @xcite using a simple setup consisting of a motor driven at a constant voltage and a speaker , as shown by the schematics in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) . upon motor startup , </S>",
    "<S> the rotating gear on the shaft immediately thickens the cornstarch , generating a large resistance that substantially slows down the gear speed . when the gear speed is below a threshold , the motor stalls . </S>",
    "<S> we then use the speaker to apply a high frequency and small amplitude ( 250hz , 18 @xmath64 m ) vibration along the vertical direction to break the force chains against the gear . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the motor under the same applied voltage starts to rotate again and drive the material , see fig.4(c ) and si video . </S>",
    "<S> this transition repeats reversibly as we switch the speaker on and off . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the motor rotation speed is maximized when we raise the vibration frequency and lower its amplitude , keeping the induced rate , analogous to @xmath65 , fixed fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure4](d ) . </S>",
    "<S> this finding suggests that the state of the system is in the dark blue channel in the phase diagram ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this channel runs upper left to bottom right indicating larger viscosity reductions at higher frequencies when the shear rate is fixed . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we replace the motor with a stress - controlled rheometer ( ta - instrument dhr-3 ) , which can rotate at a much slower rate without stalling , and repeat the speaker experiment ( see si ) . in this modified demonstration </S>",
    "<S> , the impeller on the rheometer rotates slowly when the vibration is off , and speeds up as the vibration is turned on . </S>",
    "<S> we can control such a transition between slow and fast rotations by simply switching the speaker vibration . </S>",
    "<S> these simple demonstrations show that our strategy for using orthogonal flows to control thickening is robust , and can be realized even in less controlled settings .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have , for the first time , employed a biaxial shear protocol to tune the shear thickening viscosity of a suspension . </S>",
    "<S> such a control is achieved by applying a transverse perturbation that regulates the main flow , along the lines of a mechanical transistor . </S>",
    "<S> this contrasts with passive control in which the rheological response is set when formulating the suspension and not changed thereafter . by scaling the flow measurement data and numerically investigating the force chain behavior , we elucidate the underlying mechanism of our control method and </S>",
    "<S> demonstrate how it can be strategically utilized . </S>",
    "<S> this result might inform extension of a three - dimensional continuum description so far limited to the @xmath66 regime  @xcite . using a simpler flow regulation set up , </S>",
    "<S> we finally demonstrate that the insight obtained here can inform practical strategies , e.g. , to unclog blockages caused by thickening during paste extrusion  @xcite , 3d printing suspensions  @xcite , and flow of carbon black in energy storage devices  @xcite , and , more generally , to control bistability in granulation  @xcite and jamming in hopper flow  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . in general , control over a fluid s rheological properties holds the promise for advancing actuation and motion controls  @xcite , which have applications ranging from controllable dampers  @xcite , robotic arms  @xcite , to actuating orthoses  @xcite . </S>"
