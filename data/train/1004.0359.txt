    "quartet condensation is relevant in several domains of physics .",
    "it is so far mostly considered in nuclear physics with the strongly bound alpha particle cluster playing a dominant role in certain states of lighter nuclei  @xcite and , eventually , also in the surface of heavy nuclei as may be indicated by observed alpha decay processes .",
    "alpha particle condensation may eventually occur in compact stars  @xcite .",
    "however , trapping of multi component fermionic atoms makes fast progress . the case of trions",
    "is already quite advanced , experimentally @xcite and also with theory @xcite .",
    "one may trap fermions with four different ` colors ' in the near future .",
    "this is a prerequisite for quartet formation and quartet condensation",
    ". theoretical work on this subject already has appeared @xcite .",
    "the condensation of bi- excitons in semi - conductors also may be of relevance  @xcite .",
    "in the recent past we already have published several papers on alpha particle condensation in infinite nuclear matter .",
    "for instance , we studied the onset of alpha particle condensation and evaluated the corresponding critical temperature @xcite with a procedure analogous to the pairing case via a four body generalization of the famous thouless criterion @xcite .",
    "however , quartet condensation not only is formally much more complicated than condensation of ( cooper ) pairs , it turns out that also certain aspects of the physics are quite different .",
    "the most striking feature being that quartets only exist in the so - called bec ( bose - einstein condensate ) limit where they do not overlap very much in space .",
    "contrary to the pairing case quartets can not strongly intermingle in real space and , therefore , a coherence length much longer than the inter alpha particle distance can not exist .",
    "we will give the reason for this different behavior in the main text .",
    "in this paper we will treat quartet condensation at zero temperature and establish and solve a full nonlinear equation for the quartet order parameter which will be the analog to the gap equation for pairing .",
    "a direct solution of such a highly non linear four body problem seems hopeless , even in homogeneous matter .",
    "however , we recently showed that a very simplifying approximation works very well , at least in the domain of negative chemical potentials , i.e. in the strong coupling regime .",
    "this approximation consists in making a mean field ansatz , i.e. a slater determinant , for the quartet but projected onto zero total momentum as it is relevant for condensation  @xcite .",
    "such a mean field treatment may work each time the quartet is in its lowest energy configuration .",
    "however , one may think of generalisations for excited configurations as well .",
    "since the four fermions of the quartet are all different in the nuclear case ( proton / neutron , spin up / down ) , all are in the same 0s mean field wave function and the problem boils down in the end to solve the equation in iterating on this single one particle mean field wave function .",
    "the same happens , of course , if the four fermions are components of an @xmath1 spin as in [ 16 ] .",
    "the problem still is complicated but can be solved with effective interactions of separable form .",
    "it was shown that that approximation gives comparable results as with the four body faddeev - yakubovsky equation with a more realistic interaction in the nuclear case .",
    "so , in the present work we calculate the order parameter equation with the projected mean field ansatz and a separable potential .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , we discuss the bcs gap equation . in sec .",
    "[ sec - quartet ] , we show the full expression of the single particle mass operator for quartet condensation .",
    "since this is too difficult to calculate numerically , we suggest an approximate mass operator in sec .",

    "[ sec - leveldensity ] the significant difference between pairing condensation and quartet condensation through the different level densities involved in the condensation processes . in sec .",
    "[ sec - result ] , we present the results .",
    "finally we conclude in the last section . in the appendix",
    ", we describe the detailed derivation of the equations and discuss various methods to formulate the order parameter equation for quartet condensation .",
    "in order to prepare the terrain for our procedure in the quartetting case , in this section we want to rederive standard bcs theory in a way somewhat differing from the usual .",
    "the one body green s function ( gf ) for bcs is represented by @xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the bcs mass operator    @xmath4    where @xmath5 with @xmath6 being the thermal average of the pair operator .",

    "@xmath8 is the antisymmetrized matrix element of the two - body interaction ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the single particle energies @xmath10 are in principle given by the kinetic energies plus the mean field shifts .",
    "the direct term is in homogeneous matter a constant which can be incorporated into the chemical potential and the fock - term gives rise to an effective mass . since we will mostly deal with very low density nuclear matter , we will not consider a mass renormalization here . therefore , in eq .",
    "( [ eq - bcs1pgf ] ) we have @xmath11 with the chemical potential @xmath12 which , in principle , contains the direct part of the mean field .",
    "we have attached an index on the chemical potential , since in principal it can depend on the various fermionic components involved . however , in this work we always will consider fully symmetric situations and henceforth we will suppose that the chemical potentials of all fermionic species are equal and , therefore , drop the index .    fig .",

    "a fameous example in the literature is given by coupling 1p1h and 2p2h spaces as this appears in the damping of zero sound modes , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "one may notice that the absence of pauli blocking factors opens up phase space and , therefore , enhances the coupling .",
    "one can ask the question whether in eq .",
    "( [ eq - fullalphabecmass ] ) the uncorrelated mean field 3h gf should be used .",
    "one may think to include the hole gf s into the selfconsistent cycle or even include higher correlations .",

    "because of its particular importance , before the presentation of the results , we first will discuss in the following section the 3h level density .",

    "will be radically different from the corresponding 1h propagator in the pairing case , we will pay special attention to it in this section . in mean field approximation",

    "we immediately see a strong difference with the pairing case . there , only a single hole line enters whose numerator is ( see previous section ) @xmath73 , see eq .",
    "( [ eq - bcsmass ] ) therefore , no single particle occupation numbers appear in the numerator of a single hole propagator .",

    "let us first discuss the case @xmath81 .",
    "we remark that in this case , the 3h level density goes through zero at @xmath82 , i.e. just in the region where the quartet correlations should appear .",
    "this is a strong difference with the pairing case where the 1h level density does not feel any influence from the medium and , therefore , the corresponding level density varies ( neglecting the mean field for the sake of the argument ) like in free space with the square root of energy .",
    "in particular , this means that the level density is _ finite _ at the fermi level .",
    "this is a dramatic difference with the quartet case and explains why cooper pairs can strongly overlap whereas for quartets this is impossible as we will see below .",

    "the biggest problem stems from the many dimensional integrals over momenta .",
    "we , therefore , introduced some reasonable approximations reducing the complexity considerably .",
    "a feature of great help is that the final answer is independent of the strength of the vertex function , making our approximation probably quite reliable . in our calculation",
    "we also applied the same mean field ansatz projected on zero total momentum which was already so successful in our previous calculation of the critical temperature  @xcite .",

    "we think that the results are of general validity showing qualitatively very distinct features from the pairing case .",
    "for example no well defined quasiparticles occur in the case of quartets .",

    "the relative momenta of the three holes have to be integrated over , yielding a strong imaginary part of the mass operator smoothing out any individual single particle structure .",

    "this effect is even more pronounced here than it was in our study @xcite for the critical temperature .",
