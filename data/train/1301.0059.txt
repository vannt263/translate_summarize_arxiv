    "continuous - time random walks ( ctrw ) are stochastic lattice models that have been introduced by montroll and weiss in 1965 as a generalization of ordinary random walk processes.@xcite in these models the motion of particles between different states is generally controlled by random waiting - time distribution functions .",
    "simple random walks are recovered when the waiting - time distributions are exponential functions.@xcite it turned out that ctrw is a powerful and efficient method for studying a wide distribution of complex dynamic processes in natural sciences , engineering , social sciences and in economics.@xcite it is natural to utilize ctrw for understanding transport phenomena that can not be described within classical diffusion framework.@xcite recent experimental advances in single - molecule techniques that allowed to visualize various chemical and biological processes with high temporal and spatial resolution stimulated the application of ctrw for investigating biological and cellular transport phenomena with anomalous diffusion.@xcite    theoretical studies of complex dynamic phenomena that utilize ctrw models mostly concentrate on large - time dynamics.@xcite while this might be a reasonable approach for systems where stationary states are well established and can be quickly reached , in many cases to fully understand mechanisms of complex processes one needs to have a description of dynamic behavior at all times .",
    "in addition , the situation is more complex for system that never reach the steady - state limit .",
    "the original work of montroll and weiss@xcite suggested that all - time dynamics of ctrw can be obtained by utilizing laplace - fourier transformations .",
    "although this analysis is formally correct , it is practically impossible to apply for real dynamic processes . recently , a new method of calculating dynamic properties of particles in the ctrw model at all times has been introduced.@xcite it is based on analyzing a propagator and surviving probabilities to calculate analytically exactly laplace transforms of all dynamic properties , which effectively provides all - time description of the underlying processes .",
    "it was later extended to a ctrw model with branched states as a way of investigating biased diffusion in tubes with periodic dead ends.@xcite however , it can be shown that this method could be utilized only for homogeneous ctrw with the same set of waiting time distributions at each site , limiting its application for more complex dynamic phenomena .",
    "an alternative theoretical method of calculating all - time dynamic properties in ctrw models have been presented by one of the authors.@xcite it utilizes a generalized master - equations approach@xcite that allows fast and efficient computation of all laplace transforms of probability functions and all dynamic properties of the ctrw models .",
    "the advantage of the method is the ability to analyze some inhomogeneous ctrw models as well as more complex systems , as was shown explicitly for simple periodic ctrw models and for processes with irreversible detachments.@xcite    most of chemical and biological processes can be viewed as complex networks of states that are connected by dynamic transitions .",
    "the application of ctrw method for understanding mechanisms of these systems require a theoretical analysis that is valid at all time scales .",
    "in this paper , we extend the generalized master - equations method to analyze all - time dynamics of ctrw models on complex networks .",
    "it is interesting to note that closely related method has been proposed recently for temporal fully - connected networks.@xcite in this work , stationary networks will be investigated .",
    "specifically , dynamic properties for the ctrw models with branched states and the coupled parallel - chain ctrw models are obtained and analyzed .",
    "in addition , generalized fluctuations theorems for these systems are discussed .",
    "there are many different type of geometries in complex networks that might characterize various dynamic processes . in this paper",
    ", we specifically consider 2 types of geometries : a model with branched states and a parallel - chain lattice model as shown in fig . 1 ; but the analysis can also be straightforwardly extended to other network topologies .",
    "first , we consider the ctrw model on the lattice with branched states , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the dynamics of the random walker in this system is governed by a set of waiting - time distribution functions .",
    "the particle at the site @xmath0 on the main lattice can jump one step forward with the probability @xmath1 , while the step backward can take place with the probability @xmath2 .",
    "the particle could also move into the branched state with the probability @xmath3 , and the motion back to the main lattice is controlled by the probability @xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "it is assumed that the system is homogeneous , i.e. , waiting - time distribution function are independent of the state @xmath0 : @xmath5 ; @xmath6 and @xmath7 . since detachments into the branched state are reversible the probability to find the particle in the system is conserved .",
    "our method of calculating all - time dynamic properties in ctrw models is based on the important result obtained by landman , montroll and shlesinger in 1977.@xcite they showed that the dynamics of the particle in any ctrw model can be fully described by a generalized master equation . for the system with branched states",
