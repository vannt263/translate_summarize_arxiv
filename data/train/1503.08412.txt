    "the separation of a suspension of passive colloidal particles into liquid and vapor is a complex and rather well - studied phenomenon  @xcite . for phase separation to occur",
    ", sufficiently strong attractions between particles have to be present .",
    "this is well understood from the perspective of thermodynamics : the potential energy gained by the suspension forming the dense phase compensates for the loss of entropy .",
    "recently , a separation into dense and dilute regions has also been reported for `` active '' suspensions composed of self - propelled colloidal particles  @xcite . for a brief perspective on this phenomenon see ref .  , and refs .",
    "for more general recent reviews on various aspects of active matter . by constantly converting external energy into",
    "directed motion , such systems of self - propelled particles can be driven into a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "steady dynamic states of orientationally ordered collective motion can arise  @xcite , but also swirling and turbulent - like situations were observed  @xcite .",
    "there are different possibilities how to provide the energy input in experiments : light , if sufficiently strong , can create a temperature gradient leading to self - thermophoresis  @xcite , or lead to the local demixing of a binary solvent  @xcite . in most experiments , however , energy is provided chemically , _",
    "e.g. _ , through the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide  @xcite or the release of stored ions  @xcite .",
    "all of these mechanisms are based on a symmetry breaking on the particle level . in the case of spherical janus particles",
    "@xcite it is provided by different surface properties of typically two distinct hemispheres",
    ".    what is intriguing from a fundamental perspective is that the phase separation of active colloids strongly resembles the phase separation in a passive suspension , but occurs also for _ purely repulsive _ particles .",
    "this has been demonstrated convincingly in computer simulations of a minimal model by a number of groups  @xcite .",
    "this minimal model of active brownian particles incorporates the two basic physical ingredients : volume exclusion and persistence of motion , _",
    "i.e. _ , particles interact via repulsive potentials ( or hard - core exclusion ) and every particle has an orientation along which it `` swims '' at constant speed . the particle orientations evolve independently and stochastically .",
    "the microscopic reason for particle accumulation is simple ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , the kinetic model in ref .  ): due to the persistence of the self - propelled motion and the excluded volume , particles block each other on the time scale that it takes for orientations to decorrelate",
    ". if the mean collision time is shorter ( the suspension is sufficiently dense ) clustering ensues .",
    "simulations with idealized boundary conditions show that hydrodynamic interactions due to the solvent can modify these time scales  @xcite . on the other hand , experiments  @xcite",
    "indicate that for colloidal swimmers the basic scenario is robust , and we will neglect hydrodynamic interactions in the following .    even if the microscopic mechanism is known , the collective large - scale and phase behavior is still highly non - trivial .",
    "tailleur and cates have been the first to realize that the phenomenon of phase separation in active systems can be explained by the dependence of the particle mobility on local density  @xcite .",
    "the resulting theory is referred to as `` mobility induced phase separation '' ( mips ) . within this framework",
    "it has been demonstrated that the temporal evolution of the coarse - grained density can be mapped onto that of an effective bulk free energy .",
    "good agreement between particle - resolved simulations of active brownian particles and the numerical solution of the coarse - grained density has been demonstrated  @xcite . in analogy to the mean - field treatment of phase separation in passive suspensions ( with attractive forces ) , binodal and spinodal lines are identified from the minima and inflection points of the effective bulk free energy , respectively , from which a schematic phase diagram is constructed .",
    "both lines merge at a single critical point .",
    "the resulting free energy involves only the density , a result that is based on the elimination of the polarization through neglecting temporal and spatial derivatives ( a detailed discussion follows in sec .",
    "[ sec : ad ] ) .",
    "in particular , this treatment produces a bulk free energy that does not contain a term that penalizes sharp interfaces .",
    "it is thus not able to describe the dynamics of domain formation and coarsening . in order to cure this shortcoming ,",
    "cates and coworkers have argued that the dynamics has to be augmented by gradient terms that are not derivable from a free energy  @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to follow the complete path from the microscopic dynamics to the large - scale cahn - hilliard equation  @xcite and to give a comprehensive derivation of the results obtained in ref .  .",
    "to this end we derive effective hydrodynamic equations and perform a weakly non - linear analysis  @xcite .",
    "our results refine the mips scenario in two ways : ( i )  our systematic derivation leads to a square - gradient term that completes the bulk free energy to the conventional ginzburg - landau form .",
    "( ii )  we clarify the validity of a description in terms of the density alone and show that it can strictly hold only close to the loss of linear stability .",
    "the physical reason is that this instability occurs on length scales that are larger than the persistence length of the directed motion and thus allow us to study the coarse - grained density alone .",
    "the microscopic `` trapping '' of particles due to their directed motion then enters as an effective attraction .",
    "quenching deeper into the two - phase region , the non - equilibrium nature of active suspensions will become evident again and the coupled evolution of density and orientation has to be considered .    our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : mf ] , we discuss active brownian particles as a minimal model for self - propelled disks .",

    "as shown , the mapping to a free energy strictly holds only close to the instability line .",

    "these fluctuations make numerical sampling notoriously difficult in the vicinity of a continuous transition .",

    "[ fig : coex](b ) , the fitted coexisting densities are overlaid by results from instantaneous quenching : the passive suspension ( @xmath49 ) is equilibrated at a given global density .",
    "the suspension is then quenched to the final speed @xmath14 and relaxed to the steady state .",
    "a cluster analysis is performed for the recorded configurations to identify dense domains of @xmath243 particles , from which the averaged fraction @xmath244 of particles in the largest cluster ( _ i.e. _ , dense domain ) is extracted .",

    "[ fig : coex](b ) is compatible with the proposed mapping to passive phase separation .",
    "below area fraction @xmath246 no spontaneous phase separation is observed , which thus roughly indicates the location of the spinodal .",
    "there is a larger region around the putative critical point where spontaneous phase separation seems to occur even below the extrapolated binodal , which , however , could be interpreted as a finite - size effect . in a finite system ,",
    "large fluctuations appear as dense domains but would not lead to full phase separation in a larger system .",
    "however , this does not explain the observed phase separation at higher area fraction @xmath247 .",
    "at these high densities details of the interparticle interactions and the associated particle length scale may become important , which is not captured by the coarse - grained point of view of the weakly nonlinear analysis .    previously in ref .",
    "@xcite we have reported data that would suggest a continuous transition ( for @xmath248 and @xmath231 ) . in line with this observation , in ref .",
    "@xcite an abrupt onset of hysteresis for area fraction @xmath249 has been observed , which thus agrees with the mean - field prediction of a change from continuous to discontinuous ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : nuc ] ) . whether this observed change is a numerical artefact due to the vicinity to a single critical point ( as in passive phase separation ) or a genuine non - equilibrium effect remains to be investigated .    for completeness",
    ", we note that for a single dense domain ( as observed at intermediate system sizes ) a simple relation between @xmath250 and the coexisting densities exists via the lever rule , @xmath251 this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : coex](c ) .",
    "the result for @xmath250 obtained from the cluster analysis is slightly larger , which may be attributed to the interfacial particles being counted towards the dense phase .",
    "to summarize , we have followed a systematic route from the microscopic dynamics to the large - scale cahn - hilliard equation to address the phase behavior of active brownian particles . in ref .",
    "@xcite , starting from the microscopic dynamics , effective hydrodynamic equations have been derived for the temporal evolution of ( weakly perturbed ) density and average orientation .",
    "two parameters enter these equations : the free speed @xmath14 and the global density @xmath67 .",
    "all details of the particle interactions are contained in the single function @xmath31 , which quantifies the force imbalance due to the interplay between repulsive forces and directed motion .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations exhibit a dynamical instability at @xmath188 , which can be determined through a linear stability analysis  @xcite .",
    "to go beyond the linear regime , we have performed a weakly non - linear analysis  @xcite close to the instability line using as the small expansion parameter @xmath211 .",
    "this approach yields an equation of motion for the density alone , which is formally equivalent to a cahn - hilliard equation .",
    "it involves a local effective free energy .",
    "we have discussed two expansions holding for different ranges of the speed @xmath106 , which together agree with the scenario of mapping active to passive phase separation _ close to the loss of linear stability_. what happens further away from the instability line ? including higher orders of the expansion is of course possible but will lead to a large number of additional terms . already at the next order the non - equilibrium nature of the active suspension will become manifest since a description in terms of density fluctuations alone is not possible anymore and the time evolution of the polarization has to be included . hence , there seems to be no real advantage in going to higher orders since one can also study the original hydrodynamic equations .    one should stress that we have described a mean - field scenario for the one - point density .",
    "stationary two - point correlations are an input to the theory and higher order correlations are neglected .",
    "gaussian noise could be added , which accounts for uncorrelated fluctuations but of course does not restore the missing correlations .",
    "for passive suspensions it is well known that mean - field free energies have to be regularized by the maxwell construction to be thermodynamically valid . moreover , experimentally and in simulations no sharp loss of linear stability is observed and the `` spinodal '' line is a pure mean - field concept  @xcite .",
    "still , one might wonder why for active brownian particles a mean - field description nevertheless seems to reproduce domain morphologies of particle - based simulations to such a good degree  @xcite .",
    "it thus remains to be tested numerically to which extend the theory outlined here is valid .",
    "some evidence has been discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] but more detailed numerical investigations are clearly needed .    despite recent progress",
    "there are many open questions even for the simple minimal model studies here .",
    "for example , the determination of the full phase diagram is still an open issue both theoretical and numerical .",
    "as we have shown here , in the mean - field picture already the instability line has a richer structure than anticipated previously",
    ". it will be particularly interesting to study speeds close to @xmath95 in order to determine the nature of the disorder - order transition .",
    "however , simulations in this parameter region are hampered by the large critical fluctuations and will require a more detailed study of finite - size effects than available so far .",
    "another open issue is the relation between effective free energy and mechanical pressure  @xcite .    finally ,",
    "while here we have studied analytically the simplest version of active brownian particles ( namely monodisperse repulsive disks ) in two dimensions without alignment and without hydrodynamic interactions , we note that multiple extensions of this model have been discussed in the literature : mixtures of active and passive particles  @xcite , role of attractive interactions  @xcite and alignment  @xcite , and polydispersity in connection with the glass transition  @xcite .",
