    "although it is generally driven by violent events or instabilities at large scales , a further cascade is responsible for transferring energy via nonlinear coupling from the large injection scale to much smaller scales , through the ion and the electron characteristic regimes , where they are eventually dissipated . in - situ measurements in the solar wind",
    "represent a unique opportunity to study those processes , since they provide observations in a huge range of scales ( see for example reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "the estimated turbulent energy cascade rate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) is comparable to the proton heating needed to explain the non adiabatic evolution of the solar wind plasma during its expansion ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that turbulence plays an active role in transferring energy from electromagnetic fields to particles and heats the solar wind plasma .",
    "however , the processes that ultimately lead to heating in a collisionless turbulent medium are still unknown .    supporting evidence of a turbulent cascade is provided by the observed energy spectra , which exhibit a power - law behavior over a large range of scales , spanning nearly four decades in frequency .",
    "the spectral index of magnetic and kinetic spectra varies with the temperature of the solar wind streams @xcite .",
    "the latter is in turn correlated with the stream speed and , although to a smaller extent , with the degree of alfvenicity , i.e. , the correlation between kinetic and magnetic fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , on average , at fluid - like scales a typical kolmogorov power law with spectral index @xmath0 is usually observed for magnetic fluctuations , while kinetic energy spectra show a iroshnikov - kraichnan @xmath1 scaling @xcite .",
    "in particular , such scaling is found to be typical of regimes with balanced turbulence , i.e. , zero cross - helicity @xcite . in the same range of scales , a certain amount of residual energy ,",
    "i.e. , an excess of magnetic to kinetic energy , is typically observed , following a well defined power - law scaling with an index of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the electric field spectrum is observed to follow the velocity spectrum , when measured in the solar wind frame @xcite , while density fluctuations exhibit a kolmogorov - like cascade .    in the vicinity of the ion inertial length scale , a break in the magnetic field power spectrum",
    "is observed @xcite .",
    "early observations of the spectrum of magnetic fluctuations in a restricted region above the break found a power - law scaling with a variable spectral index , ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",

    "magnetic fluctuations at sub proton scales are also characterized by a reduction of the magnetic variance anisotropy @xcite , and by an increase of the magnetic compressibility @xcite , suggesting a change in the nonlinear interactions ruling the cascade .",
    "this is partially confirmed by the measured increase of the intermittency at ion scales @xcite , although a clear behavior of the flatness at smaller , sub - ion , scales has not been identified yet .",
    "there are observational indications that , below the ion inertial length scale , the electric field spectrum decouples from the velocity field and flattens @xcite but , due to the high noise level , present data do not allow to determine the existence of a power - law scaling at sub - ion scales .",
    "density fluctuations show a plateau just before the ion scales , while they follow a power law between the ion and the electron scales , with the same spectral index as the one of the magnetic field spectrum @xcite .",
    "properties of turbulence have been extensively analyzed by means of direct numerical simulations ( dns ) , employing many different methods and models .",
    "although several features of the solar wind turbulence can be partially recovered , we are still far from a comprehensive picture . at large fluid - like scales ,",

    "the main contributions at sub - proton scales come from the hall and the electron pressure gradient terms , since the spectrum of the velocity fluctuations is observed to drop exponentially at short wavelengths .",
    "the leading terms at these scales are , then , @xmath276 note that , in general , the sum of the two terms inside parentheses would not necessarily result in a power law for the electric field . however , since in our simulations both @xmath19 and @xmath73 are observed to scale with the same power law  thanks to the strong coupling between the plasma and the magnetic compressibility  then the expected spectral index for the electric field is : @xmath277[eq : e_subion ] although it is not possible to directly test this scaling for the electric field spectrum in run a , individual terms in eq .",
    "follow well the prediction ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : efield ] ) .",
    "moreover , we were able to show that when assuming @xmath210 ( i.e. , setting to zero the electron pressure gradient term in the ohm s law ) , then the electric field spectrum  hence dominated by the hall term  follows a @xmath278 scaling in the sub - proton range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : efield_beta0 ] ) , being only very slightly affected by numerical effects at very small scales ( @xmath279 ) .    as a result of the interaction of particles with the turbulent fluctuations and small scale structures",
    ", we observe an overall parallel and perpendicular heating with similar rates , so that the temperature of the plasma remains globally nearly isotropic .",
    "this behavior can be achieved only if a high enough number of particles is employed , and the resistivity is properly set in order to assure an accurate conservation of the total energy and a clear power - law behavior for the spectrum of the magnetic fluctuations at all scales . the parallel temperature , @xmath101 , is found to have a very robust evolution , being essentially independent of the resistivity , the number of particles , and the spatial resolution employed . on the contrary , the time evolution of @xmath102 is strongly determined by both the resistivity and the number of ppc : if too few particles are employed , or if the resistivity is too low , the perpendicular heating can be largely overestimated / unphysical .",
    "conversely , when a too strong value of the resistivity is implemented , the artificial damping of fluctuations at ion scales can produce a strong reduction of the perpendicular heating , thus generating an equally unphysical preferential parallel heating .",
    "this proves that no firm conclusions can be drawn about the perpendicular heating by turbulence in hybrid simulations , unless a careful and empirically fine - tuned choice of all parameters has been taken .",
    "note , however , that the fact that we do not observe a global preferential heating does not imply the absence of signatures of localized preferential deformations of the particle distribution functions , as suggested by the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : turbulence ] , where strong temperature anisotropies ranging from @xmath280 to @xmath281 are observed .",
    "they seem to be concentrated in regions with stronger coherent structures , identified by the presence of current sheets and a significant level of vorticity .",
    "these results are in agreement with previous works based on the vlasov - hybrid approximation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the overall heating is rather weak , slow , and nearly isotropic , we can infer that the local formation of large proton temperature anisotropies is likely due to energy exchanges between the parallel and perpendicular directions , and/or to the spatial transport , rather than due to the heating .",
    "solar wind observations show a certain variability of the spectral properties . in particular , the position of the break at ion scales and the shape of the magnetic field spectrum around it seems to depend on the power of magnetic fluctuations @xcite and on the plasma beta @xcite .",
    "investigating such a dependence , by exploring the parameter space of the level of fluctuations and the plasma beta , will be the subject of a fortcoming paper .",
