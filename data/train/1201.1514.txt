    "a useful tool for manipulating the local magnetic order in artificially structured materials is provided by the possibility to control the magnetization of a nanomagnet by injecting an electrical current .",

    "the result was that by varying the temperature , and hence varying the strength of the exchange - spring coupling through the spacer layer f , the relative orientation of the magnetization of the outer f - layers could be continuously and reversibly changed from being parallel to being antiparallel .",
    "consequently , joule heating by forcing a dc current through the structure allows an electro - thermal manipulation of the relative magnetization directions .",
    "this kind of dc current - induced manipulation of the magnetization direction was further studied and observed in stacks predicted to have nonlinear n- and s - shaped current - voltage characteristics ( cvc ) in refs .   and , where temporal oscillations of the magnetization direction , temperature and electric current in the magnetic stack were also investigated .    in this work",
