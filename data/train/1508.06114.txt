    "the mass of a star is the single most important parameter which determines the way it lives and dies and what remains from it after its death",
    ". it can only be directly and precisely determined with the analysis of the light and radial velocity variations occurring due to the orbital motion of the components of an eclipsing binary system . since each component of a binary",
    "is confined to the space that we call the roche lobe , its evolution will be different from that of a single star once it fills this space .",
    "mass transfer occurs between the two after contact has been made and disturbs the evolution of the components as single stars .",
    "detached binaries are the systems whose components have not filled their roche lobes yet and thus evolve as single stars . therefore the components of detached eclipsing binaries with well determined parameters have been regularly used to test the stellar evolution models .",
    "( bd+47@xmath4 961 , gsc 3332 - 314 ) is a detached eclipsing binary which was first observed and classified as a short period variable by @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated this star based on archival photographic plates .",
    "they classified it as an eclipsing system , found its magnitude , and published the first light - curve and its elements .",
    "@xcite , based on their first photoelectric observations , published b and v light curves and the b - v color curve of .",
    "@xcite found a mean spectral type of f2 for by using equivalent widths of the na - d line of both components . in the same study he pointed to the discrepancy between the photometric study by @xcite , which implied a middle - f spectral type for the primary , and the weakness of the na - d lines in his spectra from which he determined an earlier spectral type .",
    "was also found to be a close binary in a triple system from the light - time effect observed on its o - c diagram .",
    "this subject was discussed by @xcite and @xcite , both of whom gave very similar values of the basic parameters of the third body ( @xmath5 and e ) .",
    "in 2011 , we acquired precise photometric measurements of the system in gerostathopoulion observatory of the university of athens .",
    "we also obtained spectroscopic data for the system in order to determine its orbital parameters and the ratio of the masses of its components .",
    "we performed an analysis using the wilson - devinney @xcite model of our light curves based on our spectroscopically determined mass ratio of the system . as a result , for the first time we derived its absolute parameters ( masses , radii , and luminosities ) for both of the spectral types ( f2 and f5 ) suggested by earlier works of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the best fit we needed to include a third light , which would also support the triple - system hypothesis of earlier works by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have performed an o - c analysis to ensure that an expected orbital variation is actually observed .",
    "consequently , we confirmed the existence of a physically bound , stellar size third body and determined its parameters .",
    "between october and december 2011 ( in 13 nights ) , we obtained multicolor photometric data for with the 40 @xmath6 cassegrain telescope located at the gerostathopoulion observatory of the university of athens .",
    "the telescope s focal ratio was converted to f/5.1 from f/8 by using a focal reducer .",
    "it was equipped with an sbig st-10 xme ccd detector and a set of johnson - cousins @xmath7 filters .",
    "we present a log of these observations in table-[table1 ] .",
    "we have corrected all the ccd images for instrumental effects , using the c - munipack @xcite software package .",
    "next we performed differential apperture photometry with the same software , which allowed us to experiment with different aperture sizes until we achieved a relatively low scatter .",
    "individual differential magnitudes were derived with respect to a chosen comparison star ( ) , the stability of which was tested against a check star ( ) .",
    "we constructed the light curves using these differential magnitudes in each filter and the light elements that we calculated from a linear fit to the previously published times of minima .       *",
