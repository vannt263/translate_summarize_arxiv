    "when studying the extremal limit of black hole solutions in gravity one immediately encounters a rather unusual geometric feature .",
    "the geometry develops a throat which becomes infinitely deep at extremality .",
    "this can be seen in the simple example of a @xmath6-dimensional reissner - nordstrm black hole whose metric is : @xmath7 the inner and outer horizon lie at @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in the extremal limit @xmath10",
    "tends to @xmath11 and the proper distance between some finite distance @xmath12 and the horizon diverges .",
    "one can isolate the geometry parametrically near the horizon within the infinitely deep throat and find a new solution to the einstein - maxwell system , namely the bertotti - robinson geometry ads@xmath13 .",
    "the ads@xmath1 structure is not contingent upon supersymmetry but rather extremality , i.e. that the temperature of the horizon vanishes .",
    "turning on the slightest temperature will destroy the precise ads@xmath1 structure and bring the horizon back to a finite distance . in the extremal near horizon region , the @xmath14 isometry group is enhanced to an @xmath15 . while the hawking temperature of the black hole vanishes , the entropy , given by one - quarter of the size of the horizon in planck units , is still macroscopically large .",
    "it is interesting that a full @xmath2 symmtetry ( rather than just a dilatation symmetry ) emerges in the near horizon region given that we are only loosing a single scale , the temperature . from a holographic point of view",
    ", the surprise stems from the fact that in quantum mechanics invariance under dilatations does not generally imply invariance under the full @xmath2 conformal transformations @xcite",
    ".    we can study such extremal , and in addition supersymmetric , black holes in string theory .",
    "they are given by wrapping branes around compact dimensions such that they are pointlike in the non - compact directions .",
    "the electric and magnetic charges of these branes are ( schematically ) given by the number of times they wrap around various compact cycles .",
    "a simple and beautiful example @xcite is given by taking type iia string theory compactified on a small @xmath16 and wrapping @xmath17 d4-branes around the @xmath18 and sprinkling @xmath19 d0-particles on top .",
    "in the large @xmath19 and @xmath17 limit , this gives an extremal d0-d4 black hole with an ads@xmath20 near horizon .",
    "using @xmath21-duality on the @xmath22 , we can map this system to a d1-d5 system in type iib string theory .",
    "since the circle becomes effectively non - compact in the iib frame , our former black hole now becomes a black string .",
    "this black string has an ads@xmath23 near horizon with an @xmath24 isometry group .",
    "we can express the ads@xmath25 as a hopf fibration of the real line over an ads@xmath1 base space .",
    "the @xmath2 isometry of the ads@xmath1 base space is the left ( or right ) moving part of the isometries of the ads@xmath25 .",
    "the real line becomes the @xmath21-dual direction and thus we see how the original ads@xmath1 naturally fits inside the ads@xmath25 . from the point of view of the ads / cft correspondence ,",
    "the ads@xmath25 is dual to a certain two - dimensional cft and the large black hole degeneracy is counted by the supersymmetric ground states of the cft which only excite one of the two @xmath2 s .",
    "the isometry of the near horizon supersymmetric ads@xmath1 reflects the remaining @xmath2 .",
    "there is another class of extremal black holes which arise in string theory which can be obtained by considering a calabi - yau compactification , with _ generic _",
    "@xmath26 holonomy , of eleven dimensional m - theory down to five non - compact dimensions .",
    "typically , such a calabi - yau will not have @xmath27 isometries that we can easily @xmath21-dualize along . yet , wrapping branes around the supersymmetric cycles of the calabi - yau yields extremal five - dimensional black holes @xcite , which again have an @xmath2 isometry in the near horizon .",
    "this ads@xmath1 does not naturally fit inside an ads@xmath25 with a two - dimensional cft dual . as a degenerate limit of the warped ads@xmath25/nhek near horizon geometry of the rotating black hole , in the limit of vanishing angular momentum .",
    "the @xmath2 might then be a global subgroup of the full symmetries associated to the duals of such geometries @xcite .",
    "] remarkably , attempts to count the microstates of such supersymmetric black holes have faced significant difficulties @xcite .",
    "in fact , whenever the precise counting of microstates has been successful it has involved a cardy formula @xcite . lacking the larger virasoro structure ,",
    "one may wonder where the ` isolated ' @xmath2 of these black holes originates and to what extent it is robust .",
    "perhaps an additional motivation for understanding such an ` isolated ' ads@xmath1 geometry is the emergence of an @xmath2 symmetry in the worldline data of the static patch of de sitter space @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the static patch of four - dimensional de sitter space is conformally equivalent to ads@xmath28 , whose ` isolated ' @xmath2 does not seem to reside within a larger structure containing a virasoro algebra .",
    "one particular way the @xmath2 isometeries of the black hole manifest themselves is in the worldine dynamics of d - particles propagating in the near horizon region .",
    "we might then ask whether there are microscopic models , such as matrix quantum mechanics models with a large number of ground states , whose effective eigenvalue dynamics describe an @xmath2 invariant multiparticle theory .",
    "hermitean matrix models @xcite in the double scaling limit has eigenvalue dynamics described by free fermions which naturally have an @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "of course , such models contain only the eigenvalue degrees of freedom due to the @xmath29 gauge invariance that allows for a diagonalization of the matrix , and hence do not have @xmath30 degrees of freedom .",
    "these models are dual to strings propagating in two dimensions ( for some reviews see @xcite ) . ]",
    "some insight into these issues can be provided by studying certain quiver quantum mechanics models , which capture the low energy dynamics of strings connecting a collection of wrapped branes @xcite in a calabi - yau compactification of type iia string theory to four - dimensions . under certain conditions",
    "these quiver theories have an exponential number of ( supersymmetric ) ground states whose logarithm goes as the charge of the branes squared , which is the same scaling as the entropy of a supersymmetric black hole in @xmath31 supergravity .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the near horizon ads@xmath1 of these supersymmetric black holes is related to the exponential explosion in the number of ground states in the quiver quantum mechanics .",
    "the states in question are referred to as pure - higgs states since they reside in the higgs branch of the quantum mechanics , where all the branes sit on top of each other .",
    "interestingly , going to the coulomb branch after integrating out the massive strings stretched between the wrapped branes , leads a non - trivial potential and velocity dependent forces governing the wrapped brane position degrees of freedom in the non - compact space .",
    "moreover , whenever the higgs branch has an exponentially large number of ground states , the coulomb branch exhibits a family of supersymmetric scaling solutions @xcite continuously connected to its origin .",
    "the equations determining the positions of the wrapped branes in such supersymmetric zero energy scaling solutions are reproduced in four - dimensional @xmath0 supergravity @xcite , believed to be the appropriate description of the system in the limit of a large number of wrapped branes .    in this note",
    "we would like to touch upon some of these issues .",
    "we do so by discussing two aspects of the coulomb branch of such quiver theories , particularly those describing three wrapped branes containing scaling solutions .",
    "first we derive the coulomb branch lagrangian of a three node quiver model ( see figure  [ quiver ] ) , and establish the existence of a low energy scaling limit where the theory exhibits the full @xmath2 symmetry of conformal quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "these scaling theories have velocity dependent forces , a non - trivial potential as well as a metric on configuration space .",
    "it is also worth noting that the full quiver quantum mechanics theory is itself _ not _ a conformal quantum mechanics ( and most certainly not a two - dimensional conformal field theory ) .",
    "the emergence of a full @xmath2 symmetry rather than only a dilatation symmetry in the scaling limit is not guaranteed , and is reminiscent of the emergence of a full @xmath2 in the near horizon geometry of extremal black holes .",
    "second , we study the behavior of the coulomb branch upon integrating out the strings in a thermal state , rather than in their ground state . at sufficiently high temperatures ,",
    "the coulomb branch melts into the higgs branch .",
    "this is reminiscent of the gravitational analogue where increasing the temperature of a black hole increases its gravitational pull , or a particle falling back into the finite temperature de sitter horizon .",
    "in this section we discuss the quiver quantum mechanics theory and its coulomb branch .",
    "these theories constitute the low energy , non - relativistic and weakly coupled sector of a collection of branes along the supersymmetric cycles of a calabi - yau three fold .",
    "the wrapped branes look pointlike in the four - dimensional non - compact minkowski universe .",
    "the @xmath32 supersymmetric quiver quantum mechanics comprises the following fields : chiral multiplets @xmath33 and vector multiplets @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath35 are the fermionic superpartners of the @xmath36 , the @xmath37 are the fermionic superpartners of the scalars @xmath38 , @xmath39 is a @xmath27 connection , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are auxiliary scalar fields .",
    "the @xmath42 transform in the @xmath43 of the @xmath44 .",
    "the index @xmath45 denotes the specific arrow connecting node @xmath46 to node @xmath47 ( see figure  [ quiver ] ) .",
    "the chiral multiplets encode the low energy dynamics of strings stretched between the wrapped d - branes of mass @xmath48 sitting at three - vector positions @xmath38 in the non - compact four - dimensions .",
    "the index @xmath49 denotes the particular wrapped d - brane .",
    "the electric - magnetic charge vector , @xmath50 , of the wrapped branes depends on the particular cycles that they wrap , and the zwanziger - schwinger product of their charges are given by the @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath52 count the number of intersection points in the internal manifold between wrapped branes @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in what follows",
    "we measure everything in units of the string length @xmath53 which we have set to one .",
    ", each piece of which is given in ( [ quiverqm ] ) , ( [ quiverqm2 ] ) , and ( [ quiverqm3 ] ) .",
    "this quiver admits a closed loop if @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56.,width=288 ]    the lagrangian @xmath57 for the three - node quiver quantum mechanics @xcite describing the low energy non - relativistic dynamics of three wrapped branes which are pointlike in the @xmath58 non - compact dimensions is given by : @xmath59 and , @xmath60    in  ( [ quiverqm]-[quiverqm2 ] ) and what follows we will mostly work with the relative degrees of freedom ( i.e. @xmath61 , @xmath62 , etc . ) since the center of mass degrees of freedom decouple and do not play a role in our discussion .",
    "the notation we use is somewhat non - standard ( for example @xmath63 ) and is given in appendix [ notation ] along with all of our conventions .",
    "we note that the relative lagrangian is only a function of two of the three vector multiplets , since @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67 encode the orientation of the quiver . for the majority of our discussion we choose @xmath68 ,",
    "corresponding to a closed loop like the one in figure [ quiver ] . the reduced masses @xmath69 ( which we denote in superscript notation in  ( [ quiverqm]-[quiverqm2 ] ) ) are related to the masses @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the string coupling constant , of the wrapped branes sitting at the @xmath38 by : @xmath72 the superpotential , which is allowed by gauge invariance only when the quiver has a closed loop , is given by : @xmath73 ( where we take coefficients @xmath74 to be arbitrary ) and contributes the following piece to the lagrangian : @xmath75 in this note we only consider cubic superpotentials and ignore the higher order terms .",
    "this is consistent so long as the @xmath76 are small , which in turn can be assured by taking the @xmath77 sufficiently small @xcite .",
    "the theory contains a manifest @xmath78 global r - symmetry . in the absence of a superpotential ,",
    "the lagrangian is diagonal in the arrow ( greek ) indices and thus the theory also exhibits a @xmath79 global symmetry under which the @xmath76 transform as @xmath80 vectors .",
    "the superpotential explicitly breaks this symmetry down to the @xmath81 gauge symmetry .",
    "the theory can be obtained by dimensionally reducing an @xmath82 gauge theory in four - dimensions to the @xmath83-dimensional worldline theory .",
    "it can also be viewed as the dimensional reduction of the @xmath31 two - dimensional @xmath84-models studied extensively , for example , in @xcite . in order for the theory to have supersymmetric vacua we also demand that the fayet - iliopoulos constants sum to zero : @xmath85 .    in units where @xmath86 is dimensionless , and where we choose dimensions for which @xmath87 = 1 $ ] , the dimensions of energy are automatically set to @xmath88=-1 $ ] .",

    "the mass squared of the @xmath98 fields upon integrating out the auxiliary @xmath99 fields is given by @xmath100 . for physics",
    "whose energies obey @xmath101 we can integrate out the massive @xmath76 fields and study the effective action on the coulomb branch .",
    "finally , notice also that the coupling @xmath74 has positive units of energy and is thus strong in the infrared limit since the natural dimensionless quantity is @xmath102 .",
    "the contribution from @xmath98 loops grows as @xmath103 and thus the effective coupling constant at low energies is given by @xmath104 . in the large @xmath105 limit ,",
    "the wrapped branes backreact and the appropriate description of the system is given by four - dimensional @xmath0 supergravity @xcite .",
    "an immediate question about the above model regards the structure of the ground states @xmath106 $ ] of the theory , satisfying : @xmath107 = 0 $ ] .",
    "though an explicit expression for the full @xmath108 $ ] remains unknown , the degeneracy of ground states has been extensively studied @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the degeneracy of ground states localized near @xmath109 , i.e. the ground states of the higgs branch of the theory , were shown to grow exponentially in @xmath103 when the theory contains a superpotential , the quiver admits closed loops ( e.g. @xmath110 and @xmath56 ) and the @xmath103 obey the triangle inequality ( i.e. @xmath111 and cyclic permutations thereof ) .",
    "this growth is related to the exponential explosion in the euler characteristic of the complete intersection manifold @xmath112 @xcite given by imposing the constraints from the @xmath113-term ( @xmath114 ) onto the @xmath99-term constraints ( @xmath115 ) .. then the complete intersection manifold is given by setting @xmath116 , imposing the @xmath117 @xmath113-term constraints : @xmath118 , inside a @xmath119 space coming from the @xmath99-term constraints : @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "the space is a product of @xmath122 s since we have to identify the overall phase of the @xmath98 due to the @xmath27 gauge connection .",
    "when @xmath123 , which for large @xmath124 amounts to the @xmath103 satisfying the triangle inequality , the number of constraints become less or equal to the dimension of @xmath119 , allowing for more complicated topologies for @xmath112 .",
    "] since @xmath103 goes as the charge squared of the associated @xmath27 gauge symmetry , the number of ground states scales in the same way as the bekenstein - hawking entropy of the associated black hole solutions in the large @xmath105 limit .",
    "though a complete match between the ground states of a single abelian quiver model and the entropy of a bps black hole in @xmath31 supergravity is not known , the vast number of microstates makes these systems potentially useful candidate toy models to study features of extremal or near extremal black holes .",
    "other pieces of @xmath125 localized near @xmath126 , i.e. the ( quantum ) coulomb branch of the theory , have also been studied @xcite . unlike the higgs branch quiver with a closed loop , superpotential and an exponential growth in its number of ground states , it was found that the number of coulomb branch ground states grows only polynomially in the @xmath103 . interpreting the @xmath127 as the relative positions of wrapped branes ,",
    "these ground states can be viewed as describing various multiparticle configurations , as we will soon proceed to describe in further detail . to each ground state in the quantum coulomb branch there exists a corresponding ground state in the higgs branch , but the converse is not true . another way to view",
    "this statement is that whenever a given @xmath125 has non - trivial structure in the @xmath128 directions and peaks sharply about @xmath126 , it will also have a non - trivial structure in the @xmath129 directions and peak sharply about @xmath109 but not vice versa .",
    "for large enough @xmath130 we can integrate out the massive @xmath129 s ( in their ground state ) from the full quiver theory ( [ quiverqm ] ) . this can be done exactly given that the @xmath129 appear quadratically in ( [ quiverqm ] ) whenever the superpotential vanishes .",
    "one finds the bosonic quantum effective coulomb branch lagrangian ( up to quadratic order in @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) : @xmath133 the terms linear in @xmath131 and @xmath132 follow from a non - renormalization theorem @xcite , whereas the quadratic piece in @xmath131 is derived in appendix [ cmetric ] .",

    "the potential @xmath141 is also somewhat involved and is given in appendix [ potential ] .      the supersymmetric configurations of the coulomb branch consist of time independent solutions which solve the equations @xmath142 .",
    "for ( [ supergoop ] ) , this amounts to : @xmath143 in appendices [ sucos ] and [ finited ] we review that these supersymmetric configurations are robust against corrections of the coulomb branch theory from the superpotential and from integrating out higher orders in the auxiliary @xmath99 fields .",

    "fixes another two - degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , bound state solutions have a four - dimensional classical moduli space .",
    "due to the velocity dependent terms in the lagrangian , the flat directions in the moduli space are dynamically inaccessible at low energies  the particles resemble electrons in a magnetic field .",

    "these solutions can be expressed as a series : @xmath148 the coefficient @xmath149 , while the remaining @xmath150 can be obtained by systematically solving ( [ bound ] ) in a small @xmath151 expansion , and will hence depend on @xmath152 . the moduli space of the scaling solutions is given by the three rotations as well as the scaling direction parameterized by @xmath151 . though the angular directions in the moduli space are dynamically trapped due to velocity dependent forces",
    ", the scaling direction is not and constitutes a flat direction even dynamically . requiring that the series expansion converges , i.e. @xmath153 , leads to the condition : @xmath154 because of this condition on the @xmath151 s",

    "our previous analysis of the two particle wavefunctions , which deals essentially with the scaling direction , suggests that at least some @xmath292 eigenstates do not leak into the higgs branch .",

    "how does the @xmath2 structure act on ( if at all ) the higgs branch degrees of freedom ? perhaps a way to answer this question is via the higgs - coulomb map of @xcite ( further developed in the context of quiver theories in @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , an @xmath2 symmetry acting on the states residing in the higgs branch would resonate closely with the appearance of an @xmath2 isometry of the ads@xmath1 in the near horizon region of the extremal black hole .",
    "we have seen that the low energy excitations of the scaling regime in the coulomb branch are described by a multiparticle @xmath2 invariant quantum mechanics .",

    "if we heat up such a collection of black holes ( for example by making the centers slightly non - extremal ) they will fall onto each other due to gravity s victory over electric repulsion . naturally , then",
    ", we might ask what happens to our scaling theories and more generally the coulomb branch configurations upon turning on a temperature ?",
    "this amounts to integrating out the massive strings , i.e. the chiral multiplet , in a thermal state as opposed to their vacuum state . in this section",

    "this is the weak coupling version of the calculations in @xcite where the multicentered solutions were studied at finite temperature .. one node is ` pulled ' away from the remaining three , such that one can integrate out all connecting heavy strings in some thermal state .",
    "the remaining three nodes , which we choose to contain a closed loop ( and hence have exponentially many ground states ) , are in the higgs branch which is also considered to be at some finite temperature . one could then study the coulomb branch theory for the position degree of freedom of the far away wrapped brane as a function of the temperature .",
    "] we find that the bound ( but non - scaling ) configurations persist at finite temperature until a critical temperature after which they either classically roll toward the origin or become metastable .",
    "this amounts to the ` melting ' of the bound state . scaling solutions on the other hand",
    "do not persist at finite temperature and instead the potential develops a minimum at the origin , even at small temperatures .",
    "as was alluded to , what we find is somewhat analogous to heating up a collection of extremally charged black holes , known as the majumdar - papapetrou geometries @xcite , by making the masses of the centers slightly larger than their charges .",
    "doing so will cause the black holes to collapse into a single center configuration upon the slightest deviation from extremality .",
