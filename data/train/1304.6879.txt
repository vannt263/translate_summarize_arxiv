    "the issue that the quantum correlations ( qcs ) of a composite state are not entirely captured by entanglement ( as formerly believed ) has recently emerged as a topical subject calling for the introduction of new paradigms . despite early evidence of this problem",
    "was provided over a decade ago @xcite an impressive burst of attention to this matter has developed only in the last few years @xcite as witnessed , in particular , by very recent experimental works ( see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper , we focus on those correlations that are associated to the notion of _ quantum discord _ @xcite . following the introduction of this concept , a variety of different measures of qcs have been put forward ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "a major reason behind such a proliferation of qcs indicators stems from the typical difficulty in defining a reliable measure that is easily computable .",
    "no general closed formula of quantum discord , for instance , is known ( with strong indications that this is an unsolvable problem @xcite ) even for a pair of two - dimensional systems or  qubits \" @xcite , namely the simplest composite quantum system .",
    "unfortunately , the demand for computability typically comes at the cost of ending up with quantities that fail to be _ bona fide _ measures . in this respect ,",
    "the most paradigmatic instance is embodied by the so called _ geometric discord _ ( gd )",
    "@xcite , which while being effortlessly computable ( and in some cases able to provide useful information ) may entail unphysical predictions .",
    "it can indeed grow under local operations on the unmeasured party @xcite , an effect which a physically reliable ( bona fide ) indicator ( e.g.  quantum discord ) is required not to exhibit . following an approach frequently adopted for other qcs measures , the one - sided gd is defined as the distance between the state under study and the set of classical - quantum states .",
    "the latter class features zero quantum discord with respect to the measured party , say subsystem @xmath1 , which entails the existence of at least one set of local projective measurements on @xmath1 leaving the state unperturbed @xcite ) . while the above definition in terms of a distance is clear and intuitive , it requires the use of a metric in the hilbert space .",
    "the gd employes the hilbert - schmidt distance , which is defined in terms of the schatten 2-norm .",
    "such a distance is well - known not to fulfil the property of being contractive under trace - preserving quantum channels @xcite , which is indeed the reason behind the aforementioned drawback of gd @xcite .",
    "this naturally leads to a redefinition of the gd in terms of a metric that obeys the contractivity property .",
    "one such metric is the _ trace distance _",
    "@xcite , which employs the schatten 1-norm ( or trace norm for brevity ) . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we refer to the qcs geometric measure resulting from this specific choice as _ trace distance discord _",
    "( tdd ) .    while investigations are still in the early stages @xcite , tdd appears to enjoy attractive features , which makes it a physically meaningful measure .",
    "besides the discussed contractivity property , the trace distance is invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "more importantly , it is in one - to - one correspondence with _",
    "one - shot state distinguishability _ @xcite , i.e. , the maximum probability to distinguish between two states through a single measurement .",
    "this operational interpretation provides evidence that the trace distance works as an accurate  meter \" in the space of quantum states which , importantly , has a clear physical meaning .",
    "another appealing advantage of tdd lies in its connection with entanglement .",
    "recently , indeed , it was suggested to define the full amount of discord - like correlations in a system @xmath2 as the minimum entanglement between @xmath2 and the measurement apparatus created in a local measurement ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this way , a given entanglement measure @xcite identifies a corresponding qcs indicator .",
    "remarkably , it turns out that the latter always exceeds the entanglement between the subparts of @xmath2 when this is quantified via the same entanglement measure .",
    "this rigorously formalizes the idea that a composite state can feature qcs that can not be ascribed to entanglement . in this framework",
    ", it can be shown @xcite that the entanglement counterpart of tdd is _ negativity _",
    "@xcite , the latter being a well - known  in general easily computable  entanglement monotone @xcite .",
    "in spite of all such interesting features , the easiness of computation of tdd in actual problems is yet to be assessed . to date , the only class of states for which a closed analytical expression has been worked out are the bell - diagonal ( bd ) two - qubit states , or more generally states that appear maximally mixed to the measured party @xcite . while the proof of this formula is non - trivial @xcite , this does not clarify whether or not , besides its reliability , tdd brings about computability advantages as well .",
    "owing to the high symmetry and reduced number of parameters of bd states , indeed , most if not all of the bona fide qcs measures proposed so far can be analytically calculated for this specific class @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we take a step forward and set up the problem of the actual computation of two - qubit tdd on a new basis .",
    "we first develop a theoretical framework that reduces this task to the equivalent minimization of a two - variable explicit function , which parametrically depends on the bloch vectors of the marginals and the singular values of the correlation matrix .",
    "next , after re - deriving the value of tdd for a class of density matrices that includes bd states , we discuss two further relevant cases in which the minimization problem can be analytically solved .",
    "one is the case where the correlation matrix has one non - zero singular eigenvalue , a subset of which is given by the _ quantum - classical _ states ( unlike classical - quantum states these feature non - classical correlations with respect to party @xmath1 ) .",
    "the other case is given by the family of _ @xmath0 states _",
    "@xcite , which include bd states as special cases . while these are arguably among the most studied classes of !",
    "two - qubit density matrices @xcite , the calculation of their qcs through bona fide measures is in general a demanding task . to the best of our knowledge , in particular ,",
    "no closed expression for an arbitrary quantum - classical state is known to date with the exception of ref .",
    "@xcite where however an _ ad hoc _ measure exclusively devised for this specific class of states was presented . in the general case , indeed , one such state depends on four independent parameters and , moreover , features quite low symmetry . in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , for instance , closed expressions for a fidelity - based measure @xcite and the quantum discord , respectively , could be worked out only for high - symmetry two - parameter subsets of this family .",
    "even more involved is the calculation of qcs in the case of @xmath0 states , a class which depends on five independent parameters .",
    "regarding quantum discord , an algorithm has been put forward by ali _",
    "later , however , some counterexamples of @xmath0 states for which such algorithm fails were highlighted @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ gen - case ] , we present our method for tackling and simplifying the calculation of tdd for an arbitrary two - qubit state .",
    "this is demonstrably reduced to the minimization of an explicit two - variable function . in section  [ newsection ] ,",
    "we apply the theory to the case of bell states and that of density matrices having correlation matrix with uniform spectrum . in section [ one - singular ] , we show that the minimum can be analytically found in a closed form whenever the correlation matrix of the composite state features only one non - zero singular value . as an application of this finding , in subsection [ qcs ] we compute the tdd of the most general quantum - classical state . as a further case where",
    "the minimization in section [ gen - case ] can be performed explicitly , in section [ x - states ] we tackle the important class of @xmath0 states and work out the tdd for an arbitrary element of this . in section [ app ] , we illustrate an application of our findings to a paradigmatic physical problem ( propagation of qcs across a spin chain ) , where the analytical calculation of quantum discord @xcite , although possible , results in uninformative formulas .",
    "we show that , while the time behavior of tdd exhibits the same qualitative features as the quantum discord , its analytical expression is quite simple .",
    "we finally draw our conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "a few technical details are presented in the appendix .",
    "the one - sided tdd @xmath3 from @xmath1 to @xmath4 of a bipartite quantum state @xmath5 is defined as the minimal ( trace norm ) distance between such state and the set @xmath6 of _ classical - quantum _ density matrices which exhibit zero quantum discord with respect to local measurements on @xmath1 , i.e. states which admit an unravelling of the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 being orthonormal vectors of @xmath1 and @xmath9 being positive ( non necessarily normalized ) operators of @xmath4 .",
