    "suppression of @xmath0  production due to screening of the binding potential of charm and anti - charm quarks in hot and dense matter is a classic signature of the quark gluon plasma formation @xcite and has been intensively studied in previous years .",
    "the na50@xcite and na60@xcite experiments at cern - sps ( at @xmath2 = 17.3 gev ) observed a strong suppression of @xmath0  as a function of centrality . the results from the phenix collaboration at rhic show that the @xmath0  suppression for @xmath3 5 gev / c at mid - rapidity is similar to that observed at sps energies@xcite , although the energy density and temperature reached at rhic are much higher than at sps . on the other hand , the suppression at forward rapidity is stronger than at mid - rapidity .",
    "such a pattern suggests that additional processes other than @xmath0  dissociation take place , such as recombination of charm quarks , sequential dissociation of exited charmonia states or feeddown from b - mesons , may compensate for @xmath0  dissociation .",
    "one of the interesting developments is the so called hot wind dissociation@xcite .",
    "using ads / cft duality , it was predicted that the @xmath0  effective dissociation temperature decreases with increasing @xmath0  velocity . at rhic energies ,",
    "the expectation from the hot wind model is that the system temperature should be below the @xmath0  effective dissociation temperature for @xmath0  with @xmath4 5 gev / c , and above for higher @xmath5 , and therefore the suppression is expected to be stronger at high @xmath5 .",
    "these predictions can be tested with @xmath0  measurements at high transverse momentum .",
    "in addition to the study of @xmath0  interactions with the medium produced in nuclear collisions , charmonium production in proton collisions is of interest in its own right . the production is not well understood as several mechanisms can play a role .",
    "these include direct production via gluon fusion , whether the state is formed through color singlet or octet , the contributions from parton fragmentation , and feeddown from other charmonium states and b - mesons . at the moment",
    "no model explains the major features of the existing data@xcite .",
    "the measurement of high-@xmath5  @xmath0  in nucleus - nucleus collisions , together with high-@xmath5  @xmath0  p+p data , might shed some light on charmonium production .    in this paper , the recent studies of @xmath0  production in au+au and cu+cu from the star experiment are presented .",
    "we report and discuss the measurements of the nuclear modification factor as a function of transverse momentum and centrality .",
    "the study of low-@xmath5  @xmath0  production ( @xmath6 5 gev / c ) has been done using minimum bias data in cu+cu ( year 2005 ) and au+au ( year 2007 ) collisions at @xmath2 = 200 gev while the high-@xmath5  @xmath0  were studied using triggered data collected in cu+cu collisions . in the analysis reported here",
    ", the @xmath0  were reconstructed through the di - electron decay channel ( branching ratio = 5.9% ) .",
    "star is well suited for such studies , as the large acceptance time projection chamber ( tpc ) provides electron identification at moderate @xmath5  ( via de / dx measurements ) , and at high-@xmath5  the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc ) is a very effective tool to identify electrons .",
    "the bemc can be also used for fast online triggering to enrich the electron sample . in the case of minimum - bias cu+cu collisions ( 0 - 60% of total cross - section , 27 m events )",
    "only de / dx from the star tpc was used to identify electrons and reject hadrons . for minimum - bias au+au collisions ( 0 - 80% of total cross - section , 64 m events ) ,",
    "the bemc provided an additional cut on the ratio of track momentum to energy . to improve the signal - to - background ratio ,",
    "a cut of @xmath7 1.1 gev / c in cu+cu ( @xmath7 1.2 gev / c in au+au ) was applied for each electron selected in the studies . for the high-@xmath5  @xmath0  analysis ,",
    "the bemc triggered data for cu+cu collisions ( year 2005 ) were used with transverse energy threshold @xmath83.75 gev ( integrated luminosity @xmath9 @xmath10 ) .",
    "the higher-@xmath5  electron is identified using combined information from the bemc ( tower energy ) , the shower max detector embedded in bemc ( shower shape ) and de / dx measured in tpc , while only tpc is used to identify the second electron . to ensure a clean @xmath0  identification , @xmath5  cuts of 3.5 gev / c for the higher-@xmath5  electron and 1.5 gev / c for the lower-@xmath5",
    "electron were applied .",
    "figure [ jpsisignal ] shows the @xmath11 invariant mass distributions in au+au at @xmath2 = 200 gev . on the left plot ,",
    "the signal and background distribution before background subtraction are presented for au+au , while on the right plot the @xmath0  invariant mass after background subtraction is shown .",
    "the background in the case of au+au , as well as for cu+cu collisions , was estimated by the event mixing technique and normalized to the total number of like -sign pairs .",
    "the shape of the @xmath0  mass peak is well described by a crystal ball function@xcite . despite rather high background level ( signal - to - background ratio = 1/13 for cu+cu and 1/28 for au+au )",
    "we have observed a prominent @xmath0  signal with significance of 4.5@xmath12 in cu+cu and 6.5@xmath12 in au+au collisions .",
    "the @xmath0  signal in au+au is promising and the studies are underway .",
    "the @xmath0  @xmath5  spectrum presented on fig .",
    "[ ptspectrum ] shows star s ability to measure the production of low and high @xmath5  @xmath0 .",
    "the recent star upgrades , namely new time - of - flight detector and fast tpc daq system , will greatly improve the low-@xmath5  @xmath0  measurements .",
    "the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath13 ) for @xmath0  as a function of centrality ( represented by number of participants ) ( left panel ) and @xmath5  ( right panel ) for cu+cu at @xmath2 = 200 gev are presented on fig . [ raa ] and compared to phenix results@xcite .",
    "the @xmath13  vs @xmath14 was obtained using minimum - bias cu+cu collisions only .",
    "the results are consistent with previously published data but , due to relatively modest statistics , the results have limited discrimination power . the @xmath13  vs @xmath5  for high-@xmath5  @xmath0",
    "is presented for top @xmath15 and @xmath16 cu+cu collisions@xcite .",
    "the @xmath13  seems to increase with @xmath5  and it is consistent with unity for @xmath5  @xmath17 5 gev / c : the average of the two star @xmath18 data points gives @xmath13  = 1.4 @xmath19 0.4 ( stat . ) @xmath19 0.2 ( syst . ) .",
    "the dashed curve shows the predictions of an ads / cft - based calculation embedded in a hydrodynamic model with hot wind dissociation incorporated - the data contradict the predicted @xmath5  dependence .",
    "the dotted line represents calculations of the so called two component model@xcite which includes @xmath0  dissociation , statistical @xmath20 coalescence , @xmath0  formation time effects and b - meson feeddown .",
    "the model describes the overall trend of the data fairly well . the same calculations but without bottom feeddown and finite formation time , predict decrease of @xmath13  with @xmath5  which may suggest the important role of these effects .",
    "on the other hand the recent star results show the b - meson feeddown contribution to @xmath0  production at high @xmath5  is relatively small , on the level of 13%@xcite .",
    "the solid and dash - dot lines provide a comparison to open charm @xmath13 .",
    "the solid line is based on the whdg model@xcite for charm energy loss for @xmath18 cu+cu .",
    "the calculations include the elastic as well as radiative parton energy loss and the predictions were obtained with medium gluon density @xmath21 .",
    "the dash - dotted line are results of the glv model@xcite for d - meson energy loss . in this approach",
    "the heavy meson suppression is described by collisional dissociation in quark - gluon plasma with @xmath22 .",
    "both calculations correctly describe heavy flavor suppression in au+au , thus one would expect a strong suppression for @xmath0  as well for @xmath5  @xmath17 5 gev / c when they traverse through the medium carrying color charges , which is in contrast to the data .",
    "these results may suggest the high-@xmath5  @xmath0  production is dominated by the color singlet channel but other processes , like bottom feeddown or finite formation time , can compensate for the predicted suppression .",
    "it is worth to mention that the finite formation time , required to build the @xmath0  wave function , is expected to reduce the dissociation cross section for @xmath23 compared to fully formed charmonium . in case of longer formation time",
    ", some portion of @xmath0  is produced outside the medium and therefore it should be sensitive to gluons and charm quark energy loss in the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "we reported recent studies of @xmath0  production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at star .",
    "the @xmath0  @xmath13  seems to increase with @xmath5  and we observed no suppression for @xmath5  @xmath17 5 gev / c .",
    "the lack of @xmath0  suppression at high-@xmath5  is in contrast to the predictions for substantial suppression of charm quarks and open charm@xcite at similar @xmath5 , and this may suggest that @xmath0  in this @xmath5  range is produced mostly via the color single channel .",
