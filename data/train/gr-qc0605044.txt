    "helioseismology and asteroseismology have provided a wealth of information about our sun , early type variable stars and even white dwarfs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , for neutron stars , this field is still at its beginning , since it is very difficult to measure their oscillation modes in the electromagnetic spectrum . the gravitational wave spectrum ,",
    "though , will likely allow us to study neutron star oscillations and obtain information about their parameters , such as mass , radius , rotation rate and equation of state @xcite . in this context , a discovery by @xcite caused some excitement : the so - called @xmath1-modes may be unstable at any non - zero rotation rate of a compact star .",
    "once excited  e.g. during the birth of a neutron star , via an accretion process , or through tidal interactions with a bound compact object  it may grow to sufficient strength to be detected by an earth - bound gravitational wave detector @xcite .",
    "this mechanism , the so - called cfs instability @xcite , may cause the fundamental pressure mode ( @xmath2-mode ) of a neutron star to become unstable as well .",
    "however , this occurs only when the rotation frequency of the star is close to the kepler limit @xcite .",
    "many gravity modes ( @xmath3-modes ) can become unstable as well , although their growth is most likely suppressed by viscous dissipation @xcite .",
    "the latter are related to either composition gradient or finite temperature , which are not considered in this work .    in this study",
    "we concentrate on the overall distribution of eigenfrequencies rather than looking at individual modes .",
    "the identification of individual modes will be the focus of a subsequenct paper .",
    "studying the spectrum as a whole is useful to shed light on questions such as : what are the frequency ranges where the star may oscillate at all ? how do they depend on the physical parameters of the star , such as its rotation rate ?",
    "which of them may become unstable ? does the spectrum have a continuous part , and are there discrete modes within the frequency range of a continuous spectrum ?",
    "we concentrate here on isentropic models , where a star s equilibrium as well as its perturbations can be described with the same one - parameter equation of state @xmath4 and constant entropy @xcite ( also called barotropic @xcite ) .",
    "deviations from an isentropic model become important only if the angular spin frequency is comparable to or smaller than the brunt - visl frequency , which for neutron stars is of the order of 100hz @xcite .",
    "@xmath1-modes have originally been defined for newtonian models as inertial modes of axial type .",
    "for relativistic models this definition is not as straightforward any more since the oscillation modes ( except dipole modes ) consist of a mixture of polar and axial contributions , leading to what was called ",
    "hybrid ` modes @xcite . still , even in the relativistic case with rotation , it is possible to assign an overall parity to a mode by looking at the dominant term in an infinite series representation over the harmonic index @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite call these modes axial - led or polar - led . if the spherical harmonic with lowest @xmath5 that contributes to the velocity field is axial , then the mode was refered to as generalized @xmath1-mode ' @xcite . following @xcite",
    ", this terminology has been made obsolete by a better understanding of the problem . in the following we will therefore always use the term `` inertial modes '' .    in the relativistic slow rotation approximation @xcite , their frequencies",
    "are found to be up to 15% lower than those of their newtonian counterparts . using the relativistic traditional approximation a similar shift was found  @xcite , but it applies to the frequencies in the corotating frame , rather than those in the asymptotic inertial frame . in all cases , the shift is smaller for higher order modes .    in non - rotating stars ,",
    "inertial modes are degenerate at zero frequency due to the absence of their restoring force , the coriolis force .",
    "rotation breaks this degeneracy , and for isentropic stars there is an infinite number of inertial modes confined to a finite frequency range @xcite . the range of frequencies they cover has been shown for newtonian incompressible stars to extend from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the rotational frequency of the star and @xmath9 the azimuthal index @xcite .",
    "later @xcite computed a large set of such modes in the same framework and confirmed modes up to 30th order to have frequencies confined within this range .",
    "@xcite studied the inertial mode spectrum for relativistic barotropic ( as well as non - barotropic ) stars in the slow - rotation approximation by including coupling of modes up to a maximum harmonic index @xmath10 .",
    "next to distinct inertial modes they found a continuous spectrum whose width depends on the compactness of the star and on @xmath10 .",
    "they all lie roughly between @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 and between @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the breakup frequency of their model . for @xmath18",
    "the authors expect the continuous spectrum to fully cover this range , with individual modes still existing inside the continuous spectrum . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite argue in their appendix that only individuals modes should be present .",
    "@xcite suggested that the width of the continuous spectrum depends on the range of values that the difference between the rotation rate of the star @xmath19 and the frame dragging @xmath20 can take .",
    "all stars show pressure driven modes ( @xmath21-modes ) .",
    "the fundamental @xmath21-mode , having the lowest frequency , is called the @xmath2-mode .",
    "they were studied first in non - rotating models . in newtonian gravity",
    "the perturbation equation describing their frequencies is of sturm - liouville type ( see eg .",
    "* ) , the solution is an infinite set of modes with frequency range unbound from above .",
    "general relativity and rotation do not change this general picture , and individual frequencies are only slightly affected for a spin frequency up to about half the break - up frequency of the star@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-mode typically has a frequency around 2khz , the lowest order @xmath21-mode a somewhat higher one . for a review regarding",
    "fluid oscillations of neutron stars see @xcite and @xcite , @xcite for rotating neutron stars , and @xcite for @xmath1-modes .",
    "many studies of neutron star oscillations use the so - called cowling approximation @xcite , which in its relativistic version allows to work only with fluid displacements and neglect metric perturbations @xcite . although @xmath21-modes can be computed quite accurately in this way @xcite , @xcite questioned whether neglecting all the metric perturbations is a good approximation for modes involving large fluid velocities , such as the @xmath3-modes .",
    "@xcite extended this argument to the @xmath1-modes , which have similar properties , and disputed the results of @xcite due to this .",
    "@xcite compared the frequencies of the fundamental @xmath1-mode for slowly rotating relativistic stars with and without the relativistic cowling approximation and found the difference to be only a few percent of the rotational frequency of the star .",
    "the same comparison for rapid rotation is not possible due to the lack of results with the full spacetime perturbations , but for newtonian stars the relative difference in the frequency is a few percent @xcite .",
    "the last two results indicate that even for rapidly rotating relativistic stars the cowling approximation would give a good estimate of the @xmath1-mode frequencies .    on the other hand , using the slow - rotation approximation",
    "may be more problematic than the cowling approximation .",
    "it seems that going beyond the first order in the rotation rate of the star , results may differ considerably from those obtained in first order @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will discard the slow - rotation limit , performing mode calculations for rapidly rotating stars using linear perturbation theory in the cowling approximation in relativistic rather than newtonian gravity .",
    "given the results discussed above , we expect to find an infinite number of pressure modes with frequencies on the order of khz and higher , and possibly an infinite number of inertial modes with frequencies dependent on the rotation rate of the star .    in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we formulate the problem and discuss the numerical setup .",
    "in section [ sec : axisym ] we investigate axisymmetric perturbations , first in the non - rotating case for comparison with known results , and then for the rotating case .",
    "results for non - axisymmetric perturbations and a comparison with the axisymmetric ones follow in section [ mneq0 ] , concluding with a discussion of the results in section [ concl ] .",
    "neutron stars have been observed to spin up to millisecond periods .",
    "this results in significant deviations from spherical symmetry both for the fluid configuration of the star and for the spacetime .",
    "equilibrium solutions will thus not be spherically symmetric , but axisymmetric at most .",
    "the general form of an axisymmetric metric describing a rotating body can be written as : @xmath22 where @xmath1,@xmath23,@xmath24 are quasi - isotropic coordinates , reducing to isotropic ones if the rotation rate goes to zero(see * ? ? ?",
    "restricting ourselves to uniform rotation with frequency @xmath19 , the 4-velocity of the fluid is given by @xmath25 , with an energy - moment tensor @xmath26 , assuming that the star consists of an ideal fluid .",
    "for the equation of state we use a simple polytropic model of the form @xmath27 . using a realistic equation of state in tabulated form would not affect our analysis or our numerical procedure . in this paper",
    ", we restrict ourselves to a polytropic equation of state to facilitate comparison of our results with previous studies by other authors .",
    "we use the rns code of @xcite for computing the background models .",
    "the same code was also used by @xcite ; we will occasionally refer to their results for comparison .",
    "table [ tab : models ] summarizes some of their models which we will be using here . for all models , the parameters in the equation of state are @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "; the central density is always @xmath30 .",
    ".the models of @xcite which we refer to in this paper .",
    "next to the resulting mass and radius we show both the angular frequency , that is used in our analysis , and the natural rotation rate . [ cols= \" > ,",

    "[ hist ] we show all solutions returned by the eigenvalue code for axisymmetric perturbations of model bu1 , using a low radial resolution of @xmath31 . as far as results for pressure modes are available from the literature we list them along with our results in table [ tab : axisym ] .",
    "no previous results are available for axisymmetric inertial modes of rapidly rotating relativistic stars ; see @xcite for modes of slowly rotating stars .",
    "very recently @xcite published frequencies of the three strongest axisymmetric inertial modes in the conformally flat approximation .",
    "they all lie inside the corresponding inertial mode spectrum ( see below ) .",
    "we notice from fig .",
    "[ hist ] that the eigenvalues are clustered into two groups , one above 1000hz and one below .",
    "these correspond to the expected frequency ranges for pressure modes and inertial modes . the latter range is more densely populated ; for example , we see more solutions between , say , 500 and 520 hz than between 2 and 5 khz .",
    "this is not as surprising as it may seem at first : according to theory ( see eg .",
    "@xcite for an overview table ) , there is an infinite number of pressure modes , with frequencies extending to infinity . for the inertial modes ,",
    "though , one expects an infinite number of modes as well , but confined to a well defined frequency range .",
    "according to our computation this range appears to extend from 0 to about 600 hz for the model bu1 .",
    "same as fig .",
    "[ hist_f ] , but for the inertial modes of the same problem .",
    "the bin size is now 25hz ]     same as fig .",
    "[ hist_f ] , but for the inertial modes of the same problem .",
    "the bin size is now 25hz ]    in figs .",
    "[ hist_f ] and  [ hist_i ] we show the @xmath32mode and inertial mode ranges separately for increasing radial resolution . in both ranges the number of frequency eigenvalues increases with increasing resolution .",
    "there is an important distinction , however : in the @xmath21-mode range , higher frequency ranges are increasingly populated as the resolution increases , while the population of low frequencies approaches a limiting value .",
    "we observe that as the radial resolution @xmath33 increases , the number of computed eigenvalues increases as @xmath34 .",
    "the lowest @xmath21-mode frequency , which belongs to the @xmath16 @xmath2-mode , is roughly the same for all resolutions .",
    "it shifts in frequency by a few hundred hz , which is just a few percent of the bin size .",
    "typically the number of solutions per frequency bin approaches a limit value @xmath35 like @xmath36 with some constant @xmath37 .    for each stellar model",
    "the maximum value of frequency eigenvalues tends to infinity for increasing resolution .",
    "this is similar to the situation for quasi - normal modes of black holes , with an infinite number of modes which is not confined to a finite part of the complex frequency plane ( see @xcite ) .    in the inertial mode range ,",
    "on the other hand , the frequency range does not change as the resolution increases ; in fact , the upper limit ( 600hz for model bu1 ) is quite robust",
    ". instead , the population increases fairly homogeneously over the whole frequency range .",
    "the total number of solutions calculated develops , just as for the p - modes , like @xmath38 .",
    "the number of points per bin grows linearly ; for the bin e.g. around 400hz , as @xmath39 .",
    "this is a strong indication that an infinite number of solutions exists in this frequency range .",
    "it would seem likely that there is an infinite number of physical modes in this range as well .    while the upper limit for the frequency range does not depend on the resolution used in the numerical calculation",
    ", it actually depends linearly on the rotational frequency of the star , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmax ] .",
    "the linear fit reveals @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 and @xmath19 are now the angular frequencies ) , with a negligible statistical error .    the highest inertial mode angular frequency for @xmath42 as a function of the star s rotational angular frequency , starting at the model bu0 ( no rotation ) and moving up to model bu1 ( 2185hz).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the picture in fig .",
    "[ hist_f ] is actually quite common for numerical studies of oscillation spectra : as one increases the resolution , frequency ranges at increasingly higher frequency become populated , while there is a finite limit for lower frequency ranges .",
    "usually one expects that at low resolution , only modes with low frequencies can be computed reliably , since they are the only ones which can be resolved sufficiently well .",
    "numerical solutions at high frequencies are likely spurious and can not be trusted . with increasing resolution",
    ", the number of reliable solutions increases and their range extends to higher frequencies .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we are confronted with a finite frequency range which shows an increasing number of solutions with increasing resolution , such a distinction can not be made in a meaningful way .",
    "it is therefore not clear which of the numerical solutions in the frequency range corresponding to inertial modes should be considered physical solutions , and which should be discarded as numerical artefacts .    just as in the non - rotating case",
    ", one can establish convergence for any finite value of the frequency in the upper range ( fig .",
    "[ hist_f ] ) , since there is a finite number of distinct modes in any finite frequency interval .",
    "the limit values very likely correspond to physical modes of the star . in the lower frequency range ( fig .",
    "[ hist_i ] ) it is not even clear how to establish a correspondence between eigenvalues at increasing resolutions , let alone define convergence and establish a correspondence to physical modes",
    ".    however , the number of eigenvalues increases linearly with the number of grid points used in the calculation .",
    "we therefore find it unlikely that this part of the spectrum contains a finite number of discrete oscillation frequencies . if an infinite numbers of eigenvalues is confined to a finite frequency range , then they must have at least one accumulation point .",
    "it is possible that there is only a finite number of accumulation points , even only one .",
    "an example for such a system is an atom which has an infinite number of bound states confined to a finite energy interval , with zero energy as the only accumulation point .",
    "however , as we increase the resolution of our calculations , the number of eigenvalues increases rather evenly throughout the whole frequency range in question , and there is no sign that there are parts where the increase might saturate at a finite level .",
    "we thus consider it likely that the oscillation frequencies form a dense set throughout the inertial mode frequency range .",
    "the spectrum may also be continuous over this whole range or in parts of it , but this can neither be confirmed nor excluded based on the results of our code .",
    "for @xmath43 the picture is more complicated but also more interesting than the axisymmetric case since the @xmath16 modes are the ones most unstable to gravitational radiation . solving this system for @xmath16 and the bu1 model in the way described in the previous section we find a set of eigenvalues containing both positive and negative frequencies . in the axisymmetric case",
    "negative eigenvalues are equivalent to the positive frequency solutions . breaking axial symmetry changes frequencies ( for an asymptotic observer ) towards negative values , so that much or even all of the frequency range corresponding to inertial modes becomes negative .    in newtonian gravity ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , a polar mode of order",
    "@xmath44 , harmonic index @xmath5 , and frequency @xmath45 , splits under rotation to @xmath46 modes with frequencies changing to @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a function depending on the eigenfunction of each mode . for low order pressure modes the value of this function is about 0.1 ,",
    "so one would need rotational frequencies close to the kepler limit for the frequency to change sign .    however , there are modes which have @xmath49 for _ any _ rotation rate , such as the @xmath1-modes , which , in the newtonian , slow - rotation limit , have @xmath50 .",
    "this is the picture we find for @xmath16 , with all inertial modes having negative frequencies . such a change of sign is often used to mark the onset of the instability for the corresponding mode ( see eg .",
    "* ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fmax ] we saw that the upper cutoff frequency for the inertial mode range grows linearly with the rotational frequency of the star . in the non - axisymmetric case",
    ", there is also a dependence on @xmath9 . for the series of models listed in table [ tab : models ] we obtain a least square fit of @xmath51 , with statistical errors of about @xmath52 for both values . for less relativistic models with a central energy density 1/10 that of bu1 , this changes to @xmath53 , close to what @xcite predicted and @xcite found for newtonian stars where @xmath54 .",
    "in the axisymmetric case a zero - frequency mode in the rotating frame has 0 hz for an inertial observer as well , corresponding to the mid - point of the inertial mode frequency range . for non - axisymmetric perturbations the center of the spectrum is expected to shift to @xmath55 , which indeed appears to be the case in our results .",
    "the corresponding inertial mode spectrum for a specific azimuthal index @xmath43 is however not completely symmetric since modes with different order @xmath44 or harmonic indices @xmath5 have different frequency changes .",
    "this change is rather small for pressure modes . as the azimuthal index",
    "@xmath9 can take arbitrarily large values , the inertial modes can , according to the above , reach arbitrarily large negative frequencies . since these are equivalent to positive frequencies with a phase difference , the frequency range of inertial modes will overlap with that of pressure modes .",
    "an overview of the spectra for three different values of the azimuthal index @xmath9 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ schema ] .",
    "the oscillation frequencies are influenced not only by changes in the equilibrium configuration of the star , but by other effects as well , such as the frame dragging at the surface and the center @xcite .",
    "these also scale linearly with @xmath19 . knowing the range of inertial mode frequencies as a function of the star s rotational period in advance may be quite helpful for actual observations of gravitational radiation emitted by these oscillations",

    "we have presented a code to numerically compute oscillation frequencies of rapidly rotating relativistic stars for both axisymmetric and non - axisymmetric perturbations , using the relativistic cowling approximation .    for the polytropic equations of state that we have employed here",
    ", we found an infinite set of pressure modes with a range of frequencies bounded only from below at about 2khz .",
    "in addition , there is a presumably infinite set of solutions at lower frequencies in a well defined range which corresponds to inertial modes . in the axisymmetric case ( @xmath13 ) this frequency range is symmetric around zero .",
    "it extends to a maximum frequency which depends linearly on the star s rotation rate @xmath57 and approaches @xmath58 for less relativistic stars . for",
    "non - axisymmetric perturbations oscillation frequencies change towards negative numbers .",
    "this affects pressure modes only slightly , while the inertial modes now all have frequencies below zero .",
    "it is not clear whether this low - frequency part of the spectrum is discrete or continuous , or a combination of both .",
    "the dense and somewhat uneven distribution of the eigenvalues is an indication that the actual structure of the physical spectrum may be quite complicated .",
    "further investigation is needed into the question how a spectrum with a continuous part can be studied numerically .",
    "furthermore , explicit time evolution of perturbations of the same configurations could provide an independent means of studying their spectrum and checking the results we have presented here .",
    "identification of individual modes in this part of the spectrum will be studied in a forthcoming paper .    applying realistic equations of state",
    "requires only slight modification of the code and will shift the frequencies to some extent , but the overall picture should remain the same .",
    "the effect of a non - barotropic equation of state on the inertial mode spectrum presents a very interesting question for further study .",
    "finally , for an accurate calculation of the oscillations frequencies , the disposal of the cowling approximation will be necessary .",
    "this is important not just to avoid deviation of the calculated frequencies introduced by the cowling approximation , which we expect to be small , but also to ensure the consistency of the problem ( see section [ intro ] ) .",
    "the major problem lies not in the perturbation equations becoming more complex , but in defining the boundary conditions in the spacetime outside the star .",
    "observation of potentially unstable modes with the now - operational gravitational - wave detectors is possible only if precise understanding of these modes and their frequency range is available as a basis for the analysis of the gravitational wave data .",

    "the cowling approximation does not include the damping of oscillations by emission of gravitational waves , and no other damping mechanism is included in our models .",
    "therefore , all eigenfrequencies should be purely real .",
    "however , the code we use is designed for calculating complex frequencies .",
    "the imaginary parts of the computed values should therefore turn out to be close to zero , on the order of machine accuracy ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is indeed the case for the majority of the solutions we found . some of the eigenvalues in the frequency range of modes , however , have a non - negligible imaginary part of @xmath66 of the real part .",
    "we are thus facing the question if some error occurred in the implementation of the perturbation equations into the code .",
    "the perturbation equations where first computed using ` m`aple .",
    "the resulting expressions were then simplified by hand and implemented numerically . as an alternative , we inserted the maple output directly into the code without any simplification .",
    "the spurious imaginary parts of inertial mode frequencies then became larger , rather than smaller .",
    "we are therefore confident that they are not the result of some actual error in implementing the equation , but a consequence of truncation error , especially in conjunction with a bad numerical condition of the coefficient matrix @xmath67 .",
    "deviations from the expected convergence were found , while eigenfunctions were also seen to be changing form in the rotating case .",
    "testing our code by relabeling the eigenvectors revealed the same results , which strengthens its correctness .",
    "still , considerably more work is required to clarify the question how numerical results can help to reveal the complicated structure of the spectrum we are studying here ."
