    "the experimental discovery of the quantum hall effect in 1980 [ ] decisively put topological phases in the limelight , and especially during the past decade the interplay between theoretical ideas and experimental advances has lead to a spectacular developments with intriguing prospects for future technological applications @xcite .",
    "most early work focused on topological insulators [ ] , the most basic of which are simple two - dimensional lattice generalizations of the quantum hall states , namely chern insulators [ ] , while quantum spin hall insulators stem from two time - reversed copies thereof [ ] .",
    "weyl semimetals , experimentally realized in 2015 [ ] , are paradigmatic examples of a gapless topological phase existing in three dimensions [ ] , whose time - reversal invariant cousins , the dirac semimetals , were unraveled in 2014 [ ] .    what makes these topological phases so intriguing is their robust and novel boundary states . despite their central importance , and the simplicity of their bulk description , explicit solutions for the boundary states of topological phases",
    "are only known in a very limited number of special cases @xcite and there is a glaring absence of solutions that do not require fine - tuning , that are valid in the entire surface brillouin zone , at finite size , and without the need for approximations .    in this work ,",
    "we devise a general strategy for finding exact surface state solutions for trivial as well as for topological phases in any dimension , notably including chern insulators and weyl semimetals as well as their time - reversal invariant counter parts in quantum spin hall insulators and dirac semimetals .",
    "rather than stemming from fine - tuning of hopping amplitudes our method is rooted in the underlying lattice structure .",
    "the lattices we consider can be seen as composed by @xmath3-dimensional layers of different variety , referred to as @xmath4 and @xmath5 lattices , that are stacked on top of each other in an alternating fashion such that the full @xmath6-dimensional lattice is geometrically frustrated ( fig .  [ figureallconditions ] ) .",
    "prominent examples of this type are kagome lattices in @xmath7 and pyrochlore in @xmath8 .",
    "frustrated lattices are usually studied in the context of magnetism and lead to rich physics while being notoriously difficult to understand even at a qualitative level @xcite . in glaring contrast , we find that frustration greatly simplifies the study of surface states of both trivial and topological variety . under very general conditions we find exact eigenstates of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the @xmath3-dimensional quasi - momentum perpendicular to the surface , @xmath11 is a bloch state of the @xmath12th @xmath4 lattice layer in a system composed of @xmath13 such layers and @xmath14 intermediate @xmath5 lattice layers , and @xmath15 is a simple function determined by the local connectivity between neighboring layers and the bloch states of the individual @xmath4 layers . a salient feature of ( [ exactstate ] ) is the vanishing amplitudes on the @xmath5 lattice layers , which is directly related to how the exact solutions are found : assuming vanishing amplitudes on the @xmath5 lattices puts constraints on @xmath15 and provides a bootstrapping procedure uniquely leading to ( [ exactstate ] ) .",
    "the existence of these solutions hinges only on counting of local constraints in combination with locality and translation invariance , and as such is insensitive to hamiltonian details .",
    "it is also noticeable that the exact solutions are for the full tight - binding model and thus extend in the full @xmath3-dimensional surface brillouin zone and thereby also describes the attachment to bulk bands as the states switch surface .",
    "moreover , the solutions remain exact at any finite size , i.e. for any number of layers , @xmath13 .",
    "our approach is akin to the construction of flat band models arising due to local constraints on line graphs such as kagome and pyrochlore lattices ( see e.g. ref .  ) .",
    "in contrast to our setup , these models require precise fine - tuning of the hopping amplitudes , typically allowing real and strictly nearest - neighbor hopping only .",
    "a second key difference is that the flat bands studied earlier are @xmath6-dimensional bulk bands while our solutions provide a @xmath3-dimensional manifold corresponding to the surface brillouin zone .",
    "a similarity is , however , that band touchings necessarily occur in both setups .",
    "expanding on seminal work by mielke @xcite a large body of work , including effects of interactions and disorder on line graphs , has accumulated during the past 25 years . in this",
    "context valuable insights have been obtained for antiferromagnetic heisenberg models on frustrated lattices with a flat band corresponding to a localized magnons @xcite as well as on flat - band hubbard models @xcite . alongside the extensive literature on theory",
    "( see also refs .  )",
    "intriguing recent experiments @xcite have underscored the value of these works .",
    "it is conceivable that a similar progress on topological ( and trivial ) surface states can be spurred by the present work .",
    "indeed , earlier work by two of us exploring eq . ( [ exactstate ] ) in the special case of @xmath16-oriented slabs of the pyrochlore lattice @xcite has already borne fruit : for thin slabs this provided a natural platform for nearly flat bands with higher chern numbers @xcite and lead to the subsequent discovery of an entire zoo of novel fractional chern insulators qualitative different from their quantum hall relatives @xcite .",
    "for thicker slabs we discovered that fermi arcs can in fact persist without weyl nodes in the bulk  and that when weyl nodes do occur their dispersion is generally both anisotropic and tilted @xcite",
    ". in particular , the tilting can easily be so strong that the weyl cones become over - tilted forming a compensated metal where the weyl point is a singular point connecting two fermi pockets @xcite .",
    "these systems were later popularly coined type - ii weyl semimetals @xcite and subsequently experimentally identified in a growing list of intriguing materials @xcite .",
    "the phenomena of fermi arcs without the presence of weyl nodes has been corroborated by recent experimental findings [ ] .",
    "building on our previous work we here explore the connection between frustration and surface topology in much more detail and generality whereby we derive a number of generic results regarding correlation functions , surface dispersion , berry curvature , energy gaps and the bulk - boundary correspondence .",
    "while we mostly focus on two- and three - dimensional examples our results apply _ mutatis mutandis _ to any dimension .",
    "we also refine the earlier analysis of pyrochlore slabs to relate more directly to experiments on pyrochlore iridiates .",
    "in particular this makes contact to beautiful recent experimental progress in growing ( thin ) single crystal slabs of the pyrochlore iridiates eu@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and nd@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite  two materials that both exhibit an all - in - all - out spin ordering and that we conclude are likely to have fermi arc like surface states without possessing weyl nodes in the bulk . for the yet to be grown slabs of pr@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 we however find that weyl nodes exist depending on the particular spin ordering @xcite , which is either spin ice - like two - in - two - out and one - in - three - out , while fermi arcs exist in either configuration .",
    "this work is structured as follows . in section  [ sectiontwo ]",
    ", we introduce a generic recipe for constructing our models and present the exact solutions and consequences thereof in general terms . in section  [ sectionthree ]",
    "we illustrate the effectiveness of our recipe with a number of examples : in section  [ sectionthreea ] we focus on two dimensions and derive exact edge state solutions on the kagome lattice including the chiral edge states occurring when the system is a chern insulator .",
    "we also discuss the connection between local lattice structure and topology . in sections",
    "[ sectionfour]-[sectionfive ] , we investigate the surface states of three - dimensional lattice models , most saliently obtaining exact solutions for the fermi arcs of weyl semimetals . throughout this exposition we comment of the relevance of our solutions for naturally existing , synthesized and artificial materials .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce five conditions  illustrated in fig . [ figureallconditions ] and detailed below , which , when they are fulfilled , allow us to find a @xmath3-dimensional manifold of exact wavefunctions and energies corresponding to the topological surface theory of a given @xmath6-dimensional topological phase . after detailing the general setup",
    "we describe a number of results that can be derived directly from the exact surface state solutions .",
    "we study @xmath6-dimensional models with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath3 dimensions while they are left open in the remaining dimension giving the possibility of surface state solutions .",
    "more precisely , we consider models that can be decomposed in terms of alternating layers of two different @xmath3-dimensional periodic lattices ; a lattice with @xmath17 degrees of freedom ( @xmath4 lattice ) and a lattice with @xmath18 degrees of freedom ( @xmath5 lattice ) such that the surfaces of the material are formed by @xmath4 lattices as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ figureallconditions](a ) , which we refer to as condition ( i ) .",
    "precisely @xmath17 exact solutions for the boundary states can be found in these models if the layers are connected such that the full model is geometrically frustrated , condition ( ii ) , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ figureallconditions](b ) . in this work , for the sake of transparency",
    ", we mostly consider examples in which the degrees of freedom equal the number of sites in the unit @xmath4 lattice cells , there is one available state per site .",
    "note , however , that our results can readily be generalized to include more degrees of freedom which is necessary for instance for time - reversal symmetric models including onsite spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the key assumption is that the @xmath4 lattices are only connected to each other via the intermediate @xmath5 lattices , and hence that direct hopping between different @xmath4 lattices is prohibited as shown in fig .",
    "[ figureallconditions](c ) .",
    "we refer to this as condition ( iii ) .",
    "this is a realistic scenario , because it is unlikely that the orbitals of electrons sitting on different @xmath4 lattices will overlap . upon solving the schrdinger equation",
    ", we find @xmath17 exact solutions to the wavefunction , which have total - zero weight on the intermediate - lattice sites .",
    "this is due to geometric frustration , which allows the hoppings from the @xmath4 lattices to the intermediate @xmath5 lattice to interfere out .",
    "we refer to this interference as the local hopping constraint , which is a consequence of condition ( iii ) .",
    "this shows that the connection of the @xmath4 lattices via the intermediate @xmath5 lattices is essential for our problem .",
    "hopping within the @xmath4 and within the @xmath5 lattices is allowed and will be elaborated upon in the next section .",
    "we distinguish two types of connectivity in this stacking construction . in the first",
    ", the intermediate sites on the @xmath5 lattice are connected to sites in the minimal unit cells on both neighboring @xmath4 lattices in a symmetric way . in the second case ,",
    "the intermediate sites on the @xmath5 lattice are connected differently to the sites in the minimal unit cells of the @xmath4 lattice below than to the sites in the unit cells in the @xmath4 lattice above , as shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figureallconditions](d ) . in either case",
    ", there is a natural constraint ",
    "zero total hopping amplitude to the @xmath5 lattice sites  that leads to a bootstrapping and exact eigenstates that can be expressed entirely in terms of the bloch eigenstates of the @xmath4 lattice layers . in the symmetric case ,",
    "the solutions are rather mundane with @xmath19 , while the latter case , where the local constraint necessarily connects multiple minimal unit cells , gives more interesting solutions for @xmath20 including those that correspond to topological surface states .",
    "this latter situation is referred to as condition ( iv ) . if we now include pertinent terms in the hamiltonian such that the system indeed supports a topological phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ figureallconditions](e ) , we find that our wavefunction solutions describes a topological boundary state .",
    "this final condition is referred to as condition ( v ) .",
    "we can thus list five conditions that need to be fulfilled to find topological boundary states :    1 .",
    "the lattices are formed by alternating @xmath3-dimensional lattices , referred to as @xmath4 and @xmath5 lattices , which have periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there are open boundary conditions in the direction of stacking and the outermost layers are @xmath4 lattices ( fig .  [ figureallconditions](a ) ) ; 2 .   the @xmath4 and @xmath5 lattices are connected in a geometrically frustrated fashion ( fig .  [ figureallconditions](b ) ) ; 3 .",
    "the @xmath4 lattices are only coupled to each other via intermediate @xmath5 lattices and can not directly communicate leading , together with ( ii ) , to the emergence of a local constraint ( fig .",
    "[ figureallconditions](c ) ) ; 4 .",
    "there is no way of choosing a minimal unit cell such that the local constraint takes place within a single unit cell on both of the involved @xmath4 lattices ( fig .",
    "[ figureallconditions](d ) ) ; 5 .",
    "the bulk hamiltonian supports the pertinent topological phase ( fig .",
    "[ figureallconditions](e ) ) .",
    "_ exact wavefunction solutions corresponding to @xmath17 @xmath3-dimensional bands can be found whenever conditions ( i)-(iii ) are fulfilled .",
    "fulfilling condition ( iv ) , the exact solution generically yields exponentially localized boundary states , and whenever the bulk supports a given topological phase , condition ( v ) , the exact solution corresponds to its surface theory .",
    "_      we consider tight - binding models describing non - interacting identical particles on the lattices described above . for the sake of clarity we set @xmath21 ,",
    "i.e. we consider intermediate @xmath5 lattices with a single site per unit cell .",
    "the hamiltonian describing a system with @xmath13 stacked @xmath4 lattices is written directly in momentum space and reads @xmath22 with @xmath23 , the annihilation operator of an electron in the full lattice , and @xmath24 an @xmath25-dimensional matrix given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath28-dimensional hamiltonian for the @xmath4 lattice , @xmath29 is the @xmath30-dimensional hamiltonian for the intermediate @xmath5 lattice , and @xmath31 is an @xmath32 matrix connecting the @xmath4 lattice to the intermediate @xmath5 lattice . in general",

    "( [ generalmultilayerhamiltonianperp ] ) . from this equation",
    ", we can formalize condition ( iv ) : this condition is fulfilled when @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 , and broken when @xmath55 , i.e. @xmath56 . note that explicitly calculating @xmath57 , one can still find @xmath55 when @xmath54 .",
    "this is due to the explicit form of @xmath58 and closely related to topology in the model , condition ( v ) , which is further discussed towards the end of this section .",
    "we want to emphasize that the exact solution is completely independent of the hamiltonian @xmath29 on the intermediate @xmath5 lattice .",
    "it should , however , be mentioned that the remaining @xmath59-solutions to the schrdinger equation , which are only numerically accessible , do depend on this hamiltonian and are subject to deformation by changing the perpendicular hopping strength .    inspecting the solution in eq .",
    "( [ exactsolutionedgestate ] ) , we notice three properties .",
    "first , the solution has zero weight on the intermediate sites , which means that the hamiltonian @xmath60 for the intermediate @xmath5 lattice is completely irrelevant to the solution and as such can generally include arbitrary terms .",
    "second , only the connectivity of the @xmath4 lattices via the intermediate @xmath5 lattices encoded by @xmath61 is relevant .",
    "the coupling between @xmath4 lattices may differ in strength effectively yielding strongly or weakly coupled layers .",
    "third , we can now understand why satisfying condition ( iv ) leads to boundary states .",
    "if @xmath62 , the weight of the wavefunction on layer @xmath12 , @xmath63 is the same for all @xmath12 , and the wavefunction is equally localized on each @xmath4 lattice . however , if @xmath64 , the eigenstate will localize to one of the boundaries . if @xmath65 , @xmath66 decreases with increasing @xmath12 and the wavefunction is strongly localized on the first layer @xmath67 corresponding to the surface on one side .",
    "when @xmath68 , @xmath66 increases with increasing @xmath12 and the state is localized on the last layer @xmath69 corresponding to the surface on the other side .",
    "therefore , when @xmath70 , we have exponentially localized boundary states with a localization length , and the solution in eq .",
    "( [ exactsolutionedgestate ] ) thus corresponds to the solution for the boundary state .",
    "now , if @xmath71 also has a @xmath43-dependent structure the boundary state can switch surfaces , which for a three - dimensional material means a constant energy contour represents a fermi arc . when discussing the exponential surface localization we will make use of the localization length @xmath72",
    "satisfying condition ( iv ) means we have found a suitable geometry for the lattices to find boundary states .",
    "however , when one plugs the solution to the eigenfunctions into eq .",
    "( [ equationrofkintermsofbasishamiltonianeigenstatesandphase ] ) , we may still find @xmath55 for systems deep in the zero - chern number regime . in the trivial regime",
    "it is also possible to find unprotected , weakly - localized boundary states for which @xmath57 has a non - trivial structure .",
    "therefore , we need to impose a fifth condition , condition ( v ) , that introduces non - trivial topology in the models such that we for instance obtain a chern insulator and weyl semimetal , which are examples of two- and three - dimensional models , respectively .",
    "one needs to minimally break time - reversal symmetry to find a chern insulator , such that in two dimensions , the hamiltonian should include at least one such term . to obtain a weyl semimetal , one could either break inversion or time - reversal symmetry . in the cases studied in this work",
    ", we break the latter symmetry by turning the @xmath4 lattice into a chern insulator . in section  [ sectiontwof ] ,",
    "we present an argument to understand why this leads to an eigenstate that switches surfaces .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the exact wavefunction solution directly enables the computation of correlation functions within the surface bands which are otherwise only numerically or approximately tractable .",
    "for example , the expectation value of any operator @xmath73 , which acts the same within each layer , reads @xmath74 .",
    "this expression can readily be extended to more complicated , layer dependent , operators .    diagonalizing the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ generalmultilayerhamiltonian ] ) leads to the band spectrum of the full system with @xmath75 bands , which are divided into @xmath76-bulk parts separated by band gaps .",
    "when conditions ( i ) - ( v ) are met , boundary states are present , which can be identified in the bulk spectrum as bands crossing a gap and connecting two bulk parts .",
    "it should be noted that , while the exact solutions remain unchanged , all other eigenstates change while deforming the coupling to the @xmath5 lattices .",
    "for instance , as we will demonstrate in section [ sectionthree ] , increasing the inter - layer coupling strength drives a transition between the quasi - two - dimensional layered chern insulators phase and a truly three - dimensional weyl semimetal regime .",
    "it is a generic property of our exact solutions that in part of the surface brillouin zone they attach to bulk bands in the limit of many stacked layers .",
    "this happens precisely at those points @xmath77 in the @xmath3-dimensional ( surface ) brillouin zone where the boundary state connects to the bulk where @xmath78 , i.e. where the penetration depth @xmath79 diverges .",
    "below we will provide a variational argument that shows that the gap  either from below or from above  vanishes as @xmath80 for large @xmath13 .",
    "in contrast , whenever the penetration is finite there is a gap to neighboring bands also in the limit @xmath81 .",
    "there are two types of penetration depth divergences and concomitant bulk band attachments .",
    "first , at @xmath82 it immediately follows that @xmath83 independently of model details .",
    "second , many models feature @xmath84-dimensional families of such @xmath77 points , typically along high symmetry paths cutting through the surface brillouin zone .",
    "the existence of these motifs depend on details of the lattice geometry and the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , the boundary states may switch surfaces at @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath85 \\neq { \\rm sign}[{\\rm log}|r_i({\\bf q + \\epsilon k})|]$ ] as @xmath86 .",
    "notably , @xmath84-dimensional families of such @xmath77 points necessarily exist for topologically non - trivial models although they can also occur in topologically trivial models .",
    "it is intuitively plausible that the energy gap between the boundary states and the bulk bands at the points @xmath77 should disappear .",
    "we can explicitly demonstrate that this is indeed the case by introducing a class of ansatz wavefunctions describing bulk state with nearly the same energy as the exact solution @xmath78 . in this case",
    ", the exact solution to the low - energy boundary state can be written as @xmath87 we can now make an ansatz for a class of states expected to be close in energy @xmath88 which has to be orthogonal to the exact solution in eq .",
    "( [ equationexactsolutionforrofkequal1 ] ) , such that we find @xmath89 this leads to @xmath90 however , the trial wavefunction in eq .",
    "( [ equationfirstansatznoteigenfunction ] ) is not an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian because it has zero weight on the intermediate site of the @xmath5 lattice , which it should not have .",
    "therefore , the trial wavefunction can be made an eigenstate by mixing in the state for the intermediate site @xmath91 , which results in altering the entries given in @xmath92 , such that we can create an approximate eigenstate , which becomes exact in the limit of large n @xmath93 where @xmath94 therefore , we find that the energy difference between the two states behaves as @xmath95 for large @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the energy difference between the exact solution and our variational bulk state disappears as @xmath80 at @xmath96 for large @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , there will be many such states as signaled by the family of states constructed ( varying @xmath97 ) .",
    "note however that depending on details , in particular the strength of the inter - layer tunneling @xmath98 , the variational state may be lower or higher in energy . for weak @xmath98",
    "the variational state is always lower in energy than the exact solution .",
    "however , for stronger this @xmath98 can change in the brillouin zone as strikingly the case of weyl points at which these energies are equal and a sign change of @xmath99 takes place .",
    "the appearance of boundary states is closely related to non - trivial topology in the bulk of a material .",
    "for chern insulators and weyl semimetals , this bulk topology is manifested by a non - zero chern number . the chern number for an isolated band @xmath100 of a two - dimensional periodic lattice is computed by integrating the berry curvature over the brillouin zone @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the berry curvature given by @xmath103 with @xmath104 the berry connection .",
    "the total chern number of any system has to be zero , i.e. @xmath105 . while correlation functions etc . are easily calculated the derivatives entering the berry curvature complicate analytical calculations thereof . alternatively , this problem can be seen from the fact that a ( derivative - free ) expression of the berry curvature involves all energy eigenstates of the model  not just the solvable surface bands .",
    "nevertheless , a number of instructive results can be derived .    for ( quasi-)three - dimensional models we use the solution to the surface state in eq .",

    "the chern number @xmath114 of the solvable bands in a system with @xmath13 @xmath4 lattices can be found upon integrating the berry curvature in eq .",
    "( [ equationberrycurvature ] ) over the brillouin zone as shown in eq .",
    "( [ equationchernnumber ] ) .",
    "when @xmath115 everywhere , the derivative over the second part of eq .",
    "( [ equationberrycurvature ] ) yields zero such that the total chern number equals that of one layer @xmath116 .",
    "however , in the generic situation when @xmath117 , we observe in our examples that the total chern number grows with @xmath13 as @xmath118 which means that the chern number that is associated with each @xmath4 lattice is absorbed into the surface state .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that a finite chern number on the @xmath4 lattice implies fermi arcs by considering a generic two - band model on the @xmath4 lattice whose hamiltonian reads @xmath119 where @xmath120 are the pauli matrices , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 projects on to the upper ( + ) and lower ( - ) bands respectively with @xmath123 .",
    "the chern number can be written in terms of @xmath124 as @xmath125 the chern number can thus be interpreted as the number of times @xmath126 wraps the unit sphere . provided the general structure of @xmath127 one can show that , for a very generic class of models , this implies that @xmath126 renders both the numerator and denominator of @xmath127 given in eq .",

    "an explicit example of this is provided in section  [ sectionfour ] .",
    "in this section , we study two - dimensional lattice models by stacking ( periodic ) chains containing two sites in the lattice unit cell ( red and blue in fig .",

    "when each individual honeycomb layer is a chern insulator , the chern number of the full system equals the chern number of one of the honeycomb layers , i.e. there is no enhancement of the band chern number as we generically observe in models where @xmath216 behaves non - trivially .",
    "finally we note that taking two time - reversed copies of our model yields a time - reversal symmetric model which makes contact to the arguments put forward in ref .   where no specific lattice hamiltonian is investigated but instead symmetry arguments are used to study possible boundary states on several surfaces .",
    "our findings are corroborating the conclusion of ref .   that are no non - trivial surface states on the @xmath304 surface of the khg@xmath2 materials class .",
    "in this work we have presented exact solutions for the surface states of a variety of topological and non - topological phases on geometrically frustrated lattices .",
    "rather being based on fine - tuning or numerical approximations , our solutions are remarkably general .",
    "all we need to assume is the appropriate frustrated lattice structure  which is frequently represented in real materials  in combination with local coupling between neigboring layers and translation symmetry .",
    "it should be emphasized that the exact solutions are stable ; they do _ not _ represent fragile states on the verge of being topological but are rather representatives that can be obtained arbitrarily deep into the various topological phases we discuss .",
    "for instance , while the exact solvability depends on having a local hopping coupling the different @xmath4 layers only via hopping to the intermediate @xmath5 layers , the various ( topological ) phases are stable to the inclusion of such terms .    given the far reaching success of harnessing the properties of frustrated systems through the microscopic understanding of their ubiquitous flat bands in terms of localized modes , we hope that our work will spur a development in which this large body of knowledge will be exploited in order to deepen our understanding also of topological phases of matter .",
    "we have here initiated such a program by analytically calculating a number of properties that have previously been possible by numerical simulation and in fine - tuned models .",
    "building on this , aspects of quantum transport , stability to disorder and interactions provide obvious new avenues .",
    "our investigation has thus far highlighted several generic facts .",
    "this includes the role of lattice geometry for topological phases that are not intrinsically symmetry protected ; although chern insulators and weyl semimetals rely on breaking symmetries , in contrast to phases being protected thereby , we have shown that they can not be realized with strictly local ( nearest neighbor ) constraints on lattices that satisfy conditions ( i)-(iii ) but fail to satisfy condition ( iv ) , while they are readily realized once also condition ( iv ) is satisfied .",
    "we provided explicit examples of lattices  including two - dimensional lattices akin to kagome lattices but with different stacking properties as well as a three - dimensional system corresponding to the @xmath305 grown surface of the khgx materials class  whose structure prohibits the formation of topological phases . in glaring contrast ,",
    "spin orbit coupled particles on the kagome and pyrochlore lattices are ideally suited for realizing topological phases and , even more generally , they support novel surface states .",
    "in fact , we have here corroborated the recent observation @xcite that there is no one - to - one dichotomy between surface fermi arcs and the existence of bulk weyl nodes ; while the fermi arc - like surface bands are always partially attached to bulk bands , these surface bands exist also in the absence of weyl nodes in the bulk .",
    "the fermi arcs occurring without weyl nodes are similar to those associated with type - ii weyl excitations in that they are generally blurred in parts of the surface brillouin zone due the finite density of states in the bulk . while this is a feature that distinguishes them from the surface states corresponding to type - i weyl systems , our exact solutions , which remain identical tuning from weak to strong inter - layer coupling , highlight that both the surface eigenstates and dispersion are in principle completely unrelated to the existence of bulk weyl nodes .",
    "these observations have direct bearing for engineered as well as naturally existing materials .",
    "notably , single crystal slabs of the pyrochlore iridiates eu@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite and nd@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , grown precisely in the @xmath306-direction that we consider have been recently synthesized .",
    "the possibilities of experimental probing are further extended by growing the pertinent pyrochlore slabs with variable chemical composition and doping @xcite . beyond being of great interest on their own",
    ", the study of the pyrochlores on the slab geometry may lead to a better understanding of the rich variety of phenomena associated with bulk pyrochlore iridates @xcite .",
    "our work also opens up questions of fundamental nature that call for further disquisition .",
    "saliently , we have observed that the solvable eigenstates generically carry a chern number being equal to the sum of the chern numbers of the pertinent bands in all layers .",
    "this happens immediately for arbitrarily weak inter - layer coupling as the eigenstates of the different layers hybridize and amounts to a ",
    "topological selection - rule \" whose implications and generality we have only touched upon here .",
    "finally , we note that the anatomy of the surface states we have provided , dissecting them into tinker toy - like constituents , may serve as a guide when engineering artificial materials . in the context of designing devices and quantum simulators , either in optical , cold atom systems or in the solid state , the fact that the exact solution holds at any finite size is a particularly attractive feature .",

    "<S> the hallmark of topological phases is their robust boundary signature whose intriguing properties  such as the one - way transport on the chiral edge of a chern insulator and the sudden disappearance of surface states forming open fermi arcs on the surfaces of weyl semimetals  are impossible to realize on the surface alone . yet , despite the glaring simplicity of non - interacting topological bulk hamiltonians and their concomitant energy spectrum , the detailed study of the corresponding surface states has essentially been restricted to numerical simulation . in this work , however , we show that exact analytical solutions of both topological and trivial surface states can be obtained for generic tight - binding models on a large class of geometrically frustrated lattices in any dimension without the need for fine - tuning of hopping amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> our solutions derive from local constraints tantamount to destructive interference between neighboring layer lattices perpendicular to the surface and provide microscopic insights into the structure of the surface states that enable analytical calculation of many desired properties including correlation functions , surface dispersion , berry curvature , and the system size dependent gap closing which necessarily occurs when the spatial localization switches surface . </S>",
    "<S> this further provides a deepened understanding of the bulk - boundary correspondence . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our general findings on a large number of examples in two and three spatial dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> notably , we derive exact chiral chern insulator edge states on the spin orbit - coupled kagome lattice , and fermi arcs relevant for recently synthesized slabs of pyrochlore based eu@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 and nd@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 which realize an all - in - all - out spin configuration , as well as for spin ice - like two - in - two - out and one - in - three - out configurations which are both relevant for pr@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 . remarkably , each of the pyrochlore examples exhibit clearly resolved fermi arcs although only the one - in - three - out configuration features bulk weyl nodes in realistic parameter regimes . </S>",
    "<S> our approach generalizes to symmetry protected phases , e.g. quantum spin hall systems and dirac semimetals with time - reversal symmetry , and can furthermore signal the absence of topological surface states , which we illustrate for a class of models akin to the trivial surface of hourglass materials khg@xmath2 where the exact solutions apply but , independently of hamiltonian details , yield eigenstates delocalized over the entire sample . </S>"
