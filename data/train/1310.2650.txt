    "flow stability theory deals with the breakdown of an ordered laminar non - uniform flow and the onset of turbulent structures .",
    "this transition to turbulence can be found in nature and industrial applications .",
    "for example , when observing rivers , winds as well as pipelines and bearings , we notice that accelerating a flow leads to turbulent structures .",
    "apart from its economic relevance , the study of the precise location , time and form of the transition to turbulence has fascinated generations of scientists since the famous experiment of an unstable flow in a pipe by reynolds in 1883 . due to its complexity ,",
    "even canonical examples such as the stability of a simple couette flow between two infinite plates , where one plate is moving steadily in one direction and the other plate is fixed , have been a topic of debate for decades .    the classical approach to stability problems",
    "is the so - called normal mode approach as derived by @xcite .",
    "it consists of periodic modes traveling in the streamwise direction and has been applied to the linear stability problem of a plane couette flow by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others , yielding a decay of all modes for large times . a second viable approach",
    "consists of using the modes introduced by @xcite , with a time - dependent wavelength in the cross - stream direction .",
    "rosen @xcite reviewed this approach and formulated a general solution for perturbations of a plane couette flow in the linear framework .",
    "the three - dimensional kelvin modes exhibit a period of modest algebraic/ transient growth before entering a phase of exponential viscous decay .",
    "decay of all perturbations in shear flows for large times was also shown by @xcite in a closed - form solution of the bounded inviscid initial - value problem , yielding an algebraic decay of the perturbation with @xmath0 if the initially introduced vorticity is finite .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that all eigenvalues for a small enough perturbation are less than @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a positive constant .",
    "clearly , these results contradict experiments , where transition to turbulence of a couette flow is observed at reynolds numbers of around @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it was in the 1990 s that a novel approach revealed an explanation for this apparent paradox .",
    "it was shown that non - uniform flows are non - normal : they are spectrally stable , but perturbations are able to gain the basic ( shear ) flow energy transiently and , consequently , exhibit strong growth during a limited time interval @xcite . in particular , this is observed in the short - term behaviour of perturbed flows . in the case of large enough initial perturbations , the strong short - term non - normal growth allows for non - linear effects to take place , which regenerate the transiently growing perturbations .",
    "this positive feedback - loop allows for the onset of turbulence and is usually denoted as bypass - transition @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to perform symmetry analysis of the linear stability problem of an unbounded couette flow and to show how this mathematical tool can shed new light on long - standing and well - known problems .",
    "a symmetry is a transformation which maps the solution manifold of a differential equation onto itself .",
    "special solutions which do not change under a symmetry transformation are denoted as invariant solutions , or , if scaling is part of the transformation , as self - similar solutions .",
    "generally , invariant solutions are a powerful tool for the systematic development of ansatz functions for solutions of partial differential equations @xcite . especially in the area of fluid mechanics , these have been applied successfully in various fields of application @xcite .",
    "we search for invariant solutions in the context of the stability of an unbounded couette flow and perform a symmetry classification of the linearised navier - stokes equations for two - dimensional perturbations .",
    "we show that the century - old normal mode approach and the kelvin mode approach both turn out to be among a larger class of invariant solutions .",
    "in particular , the normal - mode approach is obtained by a successive symmetry reduction with respect to space- and time - translation symmetries together with a scaling symmetry .",
    "the kelvin mode approach is obtained similarly .",
    "it is invariant with respect to a combination of a time - translation symmetry and one symmetry which is due to the linearity of the base flow .",
    "strikingly , symmetry methods also allow for a third class of invariant solutions so far not known to the authors . in the inviscid case",
    ", we obtain a new closed form solution , exhibiting qualitatively new behaviour in kinematics , energetics , and shape .",
    "in particular , the modes consist of vortices traveling at constant speed in the cross - stream direction and being accelerated by the linear shear base flow in the streamwise direction .",
    "the closed form solution also reveals a particular shape of the modes , which are energy - conserving , decay in the cross - stream direction and are periodic in the streamwise direction . in the viscous case",
    ", invariance of these modes is lost .",
    "we present a closed - form solution of the initial value problem . in agreement with expectations from kelvin mode theory",
    ", the energy of the modes decays exponentially due to viscous damping effects .",
    "we emphasize that the new invariant function limits its application to two - dimensional settings , as three - dimensional effects are not taken into account here . due to the traveling in the cross - stream direction",
    "the new invariant function also limits its validity by a finite time interval ( during which the solution reaches a boundary ) .",
    "these properties might be given in wind shear or ocean flows .",
    "due to its peculiar behaviour and its analytical simplicity , we believe that despite the limitations , the new approach presented here adds a new perspective to the understanding of shear flow dynamics .",
    "the feasibility of the found solution may be confirmed numerically by imposing the invariant function in a plane couette flow and following the dynamics by direct numerical simulation .    in ",
    "[ sec : symmetryanalysis ] and   [ sec : symmetriescouetteflow ] , we give a brief overview of symmetry methods and introduce a full symmetry - classification for the linear stability analysis of a couette flow in stream function formulation .",
    "we then show how symmetry methods allow for a systematic derivation of the normal mode approach and the kelvin mode approach in   [ sec : normalmodes ] and [ sec : kelvinmodes ] . in the following , we present the new invariant modes in ",
    "[ sec : newself - similarmodes ] . in the inviscid case",
    ", a closed - form solution of the modes is derived in   [ sec : inviscidcase ] , whereas the viscous case is studied in   [ sec : viscouscase ] .",
    "we conclude in   [ sec : conclusion ] with a summary of our results and discussion . in the appendix , linearly",
    "independent solutions to the viscous problem employing the new invariant approach are presented .",
    "we consider an unbounded parallel two - dimensional shear flow @xmath4 with a perturbation of the form @xmath5 . applying the curl on the momentum - equations for the perturbations and introducing a stream function @xmath6 yields the following linearized fourth order partial differential equation for the stream function : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath9 is the laplace operator .",

    "the first powerful tool of symmetry analysis is the concept of invariant solutions . in a nutshell",
    ", invariance means that a solution @xmath6 is not changed by the application of the transformation @xmath14 .",
    "the mathematical condition for this is that the solution @xmath22 does not change its functional form after application of the infinitesimal generator : @xmath23 as a simple example , a solution which is invariant with respect to the translational symmetry in @xmath24 is represented by @xmath25 . in this case ,",
    "condition ( [ eq : selfsimilarsol ] ) yields @xmath26 and therefore the respective invariant solution does not depend on @xmath24 .",
    "next to invariance , the second crucial tool of symmetry analysis is the combination of different symmetries .",
    "mathematically , two symmetries @xmath27 are combined by superposing their infinitesimals @xmath28 with @xmath29 and coefficients @xmath30 .",
    "for example , instead of working with a solution which is invariant with respect to the space translation symmetry alone , we can search for solutions which are invariant to a combined space- and time translation symmetry @xmath31 , such that ( [ eq : selfsimilarsol ] ) transforms to @xmath32 the corresponding invariant solution represents a traveling wave @xmath33 for which the velocity of propagation depends on the ratio of the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "together , the concept of invariance and of superposition of symmetries will help to gain new insights for the systematic analysis of ansatz functions for linear stability theory . in this work",

    "we have presented a symmetry classification of the stream function form of the linearized navier - stokes equation for two - dimensional perturbations . in particular , we have applied symmetry analysis to generate a general set of ansatz functions which goes beyond the approaches known up - to - date , namely the normal mode approach and the kelvin mode approach .",
    "we found that for a general base flow , the equation allows for a time- and space translation symmetry together with a scaling symmetry .",
    "if the base flow is restricted to a linear shear flow , we obtain an additional symmetry revealing specific properties of the flow .",
    "we have shown that the normal mode approach as well as the kelvin mode approach can be systematically derived using successive symmetry reductions .",
    "the classical normal mode approach leading to the orr - sommerfeld equation is based on the three symmetries of the equation for a general base flow .",

    "we emphasise that the invariant approach presented in this work is restricted to two - dimensional perturbations . due to the constant translation of the modes in the cross - stream direction ,",
