    "slim and compact coin vibrational motors are cheap and ubiquitous because of their use in cell phones and pagers .",
    "they vibrate because they contain a lopsided internal flywheel that rotates , at typically between 10000 and 12000 rpm ; see figure [ fig : cartoon_internal ] for an illustration . as the moving object is internal to the case ,",
    "vibrational motors provide a novel and low - cost realization of the robotic swimmer concepts proposed and investigated by @xcite , who considered locomotion in fluid of an idealized body containing an internal mass that moves within the body .",
    "locomotion due to motions internal to the body at the cellular level was investigated by @xcite .",
    "a bacterial analog might be the spirochete where the rotating flagella lie beneath an outer cellular membrane , though there the internal motion causes deformation of the outer membrane and the body is approximately incompressible .",
    "in contrast , the case of the vibrational motor is rigid but the mass density inside is not homogeneous .",
    "we use a 3vdc coin vibrational motor ( digikey part number 1597 - 1244-nd , manufacturer seeed technology , manufacturer part number 316040001 , price $ 1.20 ) with diameter 10  mm and width 2.5  mm .",
    "the internal flywheel is specified to run at least at 10000 rpm corresponding to a frequency of 167 hz and an angular frequency of @xmath12  hz .",
    "the frequency , 167  hz , is barely audible but ideal for haptic feedback .",
    "we powered the motor with a table top regulated dc power supply .",
    "the power is connected to the motor with 42 awg polyurethane coated magnet wire ( 0.064 mm diameter ) .",
    "fine wire was chosen so as to minimize drag from the power wires as they move through the fluid .",
    "the case of the vibrational motor does not rotate , rather because an internal lopsided wheel rotates , the rigid case moves in a circle countering the internal motion of the flywheel . in free space ,",
    "the case and flywheel would move in a circle centered on the motor s center of mass .",
    "each point on the case surface moves in a small loop ( see figure [ fig : cartoon_internal ] ) .",
    "a rotation period consists of first moving upward , then to the right , then downward then to the left and then back to the original position ( or vice versa if the flywheel rotates in the opposite direction ) .",
    "each point on the case surface executes the same motion simultaneously .",
    "taking a cylindrical coordinate system with origin at the center of mass , we consider a moment when the case is moving upward . at that time",
    ", the direction of motion is normal to the surface at a point on the top of the case , normal to the surface but in the opposite direction at a point on the bottom of the case .",
    "however , the direction of motion is tangental to the surface at points on the left and right sides of the case .",
    "tangential wavelike surface motions have been shown to be particularly efficient at causing locomotion at low reynolds number @xcite .",
    "a sphere that oscillates both radially and moving back and forth along a particular axis excites larger streaming motions @xcite .    at a single moment in time the motor case moves in a single direction .",
    "as the internal flywheel rotates , the velocity of the case rotates .",
    "induced surface velocities and displacements are axisymmetric in the sense that the displacements and velocities at one time are identical to those at another time after performing a rotation about the center of mass and shifting the phase of oscillation .",
    "we have ignored the location of the power wires . because of the rotational symmetry of the case / fluid boundary , the total momentum imparted to the fluid should average to zero , though the total torque exerted on the fluid might not average to zero .",
    "the object alone ( if neutrally buoyant ) could not swim , though it could rotate .",
    "the vibrational motor is denser than water or glycerin so alone it sinks .",
    "foam rubber , sponge neoprene stripping with adhesive backing , used for weather stripping , was used both to break the rotational symmetry and to make it neutrally buoyant ( in glycerin ) .",
    "we attached the foam rubber to the curved rim of the vibrational motor case with double sided tape near the power wires .",
    "the rubber foam pad is about the same width as the vibrational motor so that when viewed edge - on the entire body ( motor + rubber ) is about the same width ( @xmath13 mm ) .",
    "we started with a rectangular piece of rubber and then trimmed it to achieve neutrally buoyancy .",
    "a cartoon of the neutrally buoyant swimmer is shown in figure [ fig : cartoon ] and color photos of it are shown below ( see figure [ fig : twosnap ] ) .    the vibrational motor swimmer was placed in glycerin ( 99.7% pure vegetable food grade anhydrous glycerin ) in which we mixed some blue sand . mixing the sand also introduced some air bubbles .",
    "the air bubbles and fine sand particles served as tracers for the fluid motion .",
    "we filmed the swimmer using a 1 nikon model v1 camera with a 1 nikkor vr 10 - 30 mm f/3.55.6 lens .",

    "each movie frame has 1280@xmath14720 pixels and there are 56.48 frames per second .",
    "the movie shows that the vibrational motor swims through the glycerin at a rate of 1 body length in about 3 seconds .",
    "we filmed the moving vibrational motor in a container with interior @xmath15 cm filled to a height of 6.5 cm with glycerin .",
    "we checked that the motor swam at the same speed in a container twice as larger in all dimensions to ensure that we do nt mis - interpret boundary affects .",
    "we also checked that the motor swam in clean glycerin lacking sand or air - bubbles .",
    "when used for haptic feedback , usually the flat side of the coin vibrational motor is bonded to a surface that is meant to be touched or held .",
    "we could achieve neutral buoyancy with the foam rubber fixed to a flat face of the motor case .",
    "however we found that swim speed is maximized by sticking the foam rubber to the motor s curved rim rather than the flat face .",
    "we infer that breaking the rotational symmetry is important for efficient locomotion in glycerin .",
    "the simplest mechanical locomotors have a single degree of freedom for motion , but can move if symmetry between forward and backwards strokes is broken . for example , locomotion is achieved on a table top using a velocity dependent stroke for two masses connected by an actuator with asymmetric friction @xcite and with a single hinged microswimmer in a non - newtonian fluid @xcite . for our vibrational motor , points on the case do not move along a line segment but in a loop , and the rotational symmetry of the motion prevents locomotion unless this symmetry is broken .",
    "rubber foam behaves visco - elastically and damps vibrations .",
    "the rubber foam displaces fluid that could have been moving and it damps vibrations on the motor surface that could have induced motions in the fluid .",
    "the rotational symmetry of the motion is broken as both of these effects occur on only one side of the motor .",
    "some notes may be helpful for the reader attempting to build a similar swimmer : the vibrational motor cases are not designed to be impermeable to liquids .",
    "if left unpowered in the glycerin for a few hours , when turned on later they rotate less quickly then stop working .",
    "they are not meant for continuous operation ( cell phone buzzes are short ) and so can only run continuously for an hour or two before they wear out .",
    "a closed - cell rubber foam , preventing absorption of fluid , is superior as the device would maintain a constant buoyancy .",

    "flow in the fluid is rotational around the vibrational motor .",
    "the rotational streaming lies well outside the width @xmath45 for an oscillating boundary layer , implying that what we are seeing is steady streaming induced by the oscillation near the motor surface .",
    "figure [ fig : twosnap ] shows that the foam rubber is tilted ( to the left ) when the motor is on ( photo on the right ) compared to its angle when the motor is off ( photo on the left ) .",

    "particle motion is reduced near the foam rubber , and is lower above the motor than below it .",
    "the rotational streaming motion below the motor is not mirrored by a similar flow above the motor and so the fluid has been predominantly moved from right to left , allowing the motor to advance or swim to the right . the foam rubber breaks the rotational symmetry of vibration . the propulsion arises because fluid is streaming to the left below the motor .",
    "particle deviations between two frames ( separated by 0.3 s ) were used to construct velocity vectors and these are shown in figure [ fig : quiver]a .",

    "the streaming flow does not necessarily arise solely from matching the fluid velocity to a moving boundary ( as by @xcite ) .",

    ", the streaming velocity predicted using stokes flow is @xmath91 @xcite , where @xmath92 is the speed of surface waves and @xmath93 is the ratio of oscillation amplitude to wavelength . using the time dependent stokes equations ( as done here )",
    "we find a dependence on the viscous diffusion length scale that arises because the exponential decay of the oscillating flow depends on this scale .",
    "in contrast in the low frequency limit , the exponential decay follows from the solution of laplace s equation and depends on the wavelength of the planar perturbations . a planar model that solves the time dependent stokes equations for plane waves should give a solution that is consistent with both results .",
    "adopting the approach of the tangent plane approximation we can sum the streaming motions on all sides of the motor to estimate the swim speed .",
    "velocities in front of and behind the motor are opposite and so cancel .",
    "the velocity below the motor is unimpeded by the rubber foam and so can be estimated from equation [ eqn : vstream2 ] .",
    "the motor does _ not _ get a symmetric push from its top , because the softness and porosity of the foam rubber relaxes the boundary condition ( equation [ eqn : vb ] ) and reduces the speed of the streaming motion on that side of the motor .",
    "that on the top of the motor we can consider to be zero . taking an average of these 4 values we would estimate a swim speed of a few mm / s and in the direction counter to the flow below the motor .",
    "this is consistent with the swim speed of the motor and suggests that equation [ eqn : vstream ] is correct to order of magnitude .",
    "neutral buoyancy can be achieved with a light rigid body .",
    "but if firmly attached to the vibrational motor it too would vibrate and so induce steady streaming in the fluid .",
    "if the rubber foam were replaced with a solid but rigid and light body , the device would not swim because induced streaming above the motor would counteract the induced streaming below the motor .",
    "the foam rubber must absorb vibrations on one side of the motor so that it will swim .",
    "most estimates of swimming velocity work in the limit of small wavelength surface motions ( wavelength smaller than the object diameter , e.g. , @xcite )  with swim velocities dependent on the wavelength ( for example equation 36 by @xcite ) .",
    "here we estimated a swim speed for a solid body motion that depends only on the velocity of surface motion , frequency and fluid viscosity ( equation [ eqn : vstream ] ) .",
    "the streaming motion is induced by the non - linearity of the surface boundary condition ( as studied by @xcite ) rather than the advective or nonlinear term @xcite because we have neglected the non - linear term in the navier - stokes equation .",
    "equation [ eqn : vstream ] suggests that the swim velocity can be maximized by increasing the amplitude of oscillation , @xmath53 , the frequency of vibration @xmath3 and decreasing the viscosity .",
    "this pushes the solution to higher reynolds number where the advective or non - linear term in the navier - stokes equation can not be neglected . in this regime",
    "flows can be increasingly unstable and complex @xcite and perhaps experimental observations or simulations are required to understand the flow field and resulting swim velocity .",
    "we have assumed that the vibrational motion of the motor ( equations [ eqn : disp ] , [ eqn : boundary ] ) is circular .",
    "however the amplitude of vibration depends on the motor recoil and how the fluid and rubber foam opposite it .",
    "the surface displacement is more generally an ellipse .    for the planar model with @xmath94 tangent to the surface and @xmath95 normal to it",
    ", we can modify equation [ eqn : boundary ] to describe elliptical motion ; @xmath96 the ratio of @xmath48 to @xmath33 amplitudes is @xmath97 and @xmath98 for nearly circular motion . here",
    "the amplitude of motion normal to the surface is proportional to @xmath97 and the variables are scaled to the displacement and velocity in the direction parallel to the surface .",
    "the boundary condition ( equation [ eqn : stbound ] ) and solution ( equation [ eqn : sol ] ) to the non - stationary stokes equation give streaming velocity the same as before ( equation [ eqn : vstream ] ) but multiplied by @xmath97 . the streaming speed ( including units ) , @xmath99 shows the dependence on the tangential and normal amplitudes of motion , consistent with the geometric interpretation that the two motions do not commute .",
    "the tangent plane approximation can again be used to estimate the streaming motions on different sides of the motor but taking into account how the ratio of amplitudes , @xmath97 , depends on the local angle of the motor surface .",
    "the blur in our movie frames when the motor is on is consistent with nearly circular motion , @xmath98 , so we do not modify our rough estimate for the swim velocity .",
    "we succeeded in getting a 1  cm diameter coin vibration motor to swim in glycerin at 3  mm / s by breaking its rotational symmetry of motion .",
    "symmetry was broken using a piece of foam rubber that also served to give the motor neutral buoyancy and prevent it from rotating .",
    "movies of the motor swimming in glycerin with sand and bubble tracers illustrate that rotational steady streaming motions are induced by the vibration and that the asymmetry in the motions is consistent with propulsion .",
    "the swimming vibrational motor represents a low - cost realization of the concepts for swimming by internal motions previously proposed and discussed by @xcite . using the swim velocity to compute the reynolds number",
    ", we find that it is low , @xmath100 , and in the regime of bacterial motility .",
    "as bacteria do nt vibrate , this concept for locomotion is not helpful for understanding bacterial locomotion .",
    "however , our swimmer is novel and inexpensive , so may inspire development of small robotic swimmers that are robust because they have no external moving parts .",
    "most previous works either focused on acoustically driven streaming due to oscillatory flows @xcite or short wavelength surface waves in the time independent ( or stationary ) stokes regime to estimate swim speeds of periodically deforming bodies @xcite .",
    "we used a translationally invariant oscillating planar motion model and non - stationary stokes flow to estimate a steady streaming velocity .",
    "we find that steady streaming , extending past an oscillating boundary layer , arises from the non - linearity induced by the moving boundary , rather than by reynolds stress ( or advective non - linear term ) as is possible in many acoustic streaming problems .",
    "because the oscillating flow decays exponentially with the viscous diffusion length scale , the steady streaming velocity is also sensitive to this scale . using the tangent plane approximation .",
    "this planar problem suggests that the swim velocity should be a factor a few smaller than @xmath101 where a correction factor ( multiplying the above estimate ) depends on a sum of the steady streaming motions induced on different sides of the body , this relation is appropriate for reynolds number @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the vibrational velocity .",
    "the amplitude of motion , @xmath53 , vibrational velocity , @xmath1 , and ellipticity of motion , depend on the force exerted on the motor by the fluid so would need to be measured or computed for different frequency vibrational motors in different fluids .",
    "use of the non - stationary stokes equation allowed us to estimate the streaming velocity caused by a rigid but oscillating surface and is not limited to short wavelength surface perturbations ( as was true for the stokes regime studies by @xcite ) .",
    "however the non - stationary stokes equation neglects the advective term in the navier - stokes equation and this term should not be neglected at @xmath104 .",
    "steady streaming is predicted at this @xcite and higher reynolds numbers where the dynamics may become increasingly complex ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , our swimming vibrational motor , with @xmath75 , is in this regime . also , our vibrational motor is thin , with width to diameter ratio of 1/4 , and the tangent plane approximation is inaccurate .",
    "improved calculations or simulations can improve upon our rough approximations by taking into account the structure of the boundary layer ( or layers ; @xcite ) and the three - dimensional structure of the vibrational motor and associated fluid flow .",
