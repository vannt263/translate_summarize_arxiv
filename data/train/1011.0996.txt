    "there has been recent progress in understanding the phase diagram of higher - dimensional asymptotically flat vacuum black holes .",
    "the purpose of this work is to extend some of the techniques used to the case of asymptotically anti - de sitter ( ads ) black holes .",
    "let us first review the asymptotically flat case .",
    "while the four - dimensional kerr black hole is unique and ( expected to be ) stable , the higher - dimensional picture is much richer @xcite . in @xmath7 , the discovery of the black ring by emparan and reall @xcite showed that it can have the same conserved charges as the myers - perry ( mp ) black hole @xcite .",
    "this non - uniqueness discovery triggered the research in higher dimensional black holes and a variety of explicit rotating solutions have been recently found : black saturns @xcite , concentric rings @xcite , orthogonal rings @xcite , and generalisations thereof .",
    "consider solutions rotating on a single plane which are in thermal equilibrium ( i.e. in the case that there are disconnected components of the event horizon , these have the same temperature and angular velocity ) .",
    "one interesting fact is that in the zero temperature limit the new solutions _ and _ the mp black hole coincide in the same nakedly singular solution @xcite . in @xmath0 ,",
    "this limit does not exist , and the mp black hole has an unbounded angular momentum for a given mass . in a certain sense , the singular limit is ` resolved ' .",
    "however , does the mp black hole still connect to the new solutions ?",
    "in @xmath0 , the black ring and the other solutions have not been constructed exactly , but are expected to exist .",
    "in fact , approximate methods for solving the einstein equations in the ultraspinning limit ( large angular momentum with respect to the mass scale ) indicate that they do exist @xcite .",
    "the answer seems to be that the mp black hole connects to the other solutions through yet more families of black holes .",
    "these families bifurcate from the mp branch at the ( stationary ) onset of the so called ` ultraspinning instabilities ' .",
    "the first step in understanding this connection was given by emparan and myers @xcite , who argued that the singly - spinning ( i.e. rotating on a single plane ) mp black hole should be unstable if rotating sufficiently rapidly .",
    "the reasoning is that if the angular momentum per unit mass is large enough , mp black holes start behaving like black branes , since their horizons become disk - like along the rotation plane in this ultraspinning limit . but it has been shown by gregory and laflamme @xcite that black branes are unstable and therefore one concludes that mp black holes should be unstable for a sufficiently large ( but finite ) angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "emparan and myers further pointed out that at the onset of such an instability , there should exist a stationary perturbation that preserves the rotational symmetries of the background .",
    "this perturbation would then signal the existence of a new family of black holes with spherical horizon topology .",
    "this is analogous to what happens in the black brane case : the threshold mode of the gregory - laflamme instability is the perturbative signal for a family of non - uniform branes @xcite .",
    "@xcite conjectured that the new families bifurcating from the mp branch , when continued along the phase diagram , would connect continuously to the black ring branch , the black saturn branch , and so on .",
    "therefore , the connection of non - uniqueness with instabilities provides a partial understanding of the proliferation of higher dimensional black hole phases .",
    "recently , these conjectures were put on a firmer footing when it was shown numerically that the singly - spinning mp black hole does indeed possess such threshold modes @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these perturbations exhibit an underlying harmonic structure and induce deformations on the shape of the horizon which are consistent with the proposal that the new families will connect to the black ring , to the black saturn , etc .",
    "@xcite also conjectured that these classical instabilities can only occur when the black hole possesses at least two distinct local thermodynamic instabilities , as we shall review later .",
    "this is a necessary but not sufficient condition .",
    "the reason is that local thermodynamic instabilities are associated to the lowest harmonics , and thus with the asymptotic charges , the mass and the angular momentum .",
    "higher harmonics , which can not change the asymptotic charges and are associated to the bifurcation to new families , should only become unstable for rotations higher than the thermodynamic modes .",
    "this conjecture allows for any number of independent angular momenta , and has already been verified in the instability of @xmath0 cohomogeneity-1 mp solutions ( equal independent spins in odd @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "this sector of mp black holes has a regular extremal limit and the angular momentum is bounded from above , yet the conjecture of ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that an instability is possible",
    ". indeed linear perturbations growing exponentially with time were found , which is an important check since the previous work could only determine the stationary threshold modes .    in this paper",
    ", we will extend the results in refs .",
    "@xcite to the asymptotically ads case .",
    "the properties of asymptotically ads spacetimes have been greatly explored due to the ads / cft correspondence , which equates quantum gravity ( string theory ) in an asymptotically ads spacetime to a conformal field theory ( cft ) living on the boundary of that spacetime @xcite . in particular , the phase diagram of black holes in ads is in direct correspondence to the phases of the dual cft at finite temperature .",
    "therefore , even if many higher - dimensional black hole solutions present classical instabilities , or do not dominate thermodinamically the gravitational partition function , they still provide a valuable insight into the cft phases .    black rings and black saturns in ads have been constructed in certain approximations @xcite , and the conjectures of ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the connections between singly - spinning black hole families were extended to the asymptotically ads case also in ref .",
    "notice that singly - spinning mp - ads black holes @xcite ( and indeed any asymptotically ads stationary black hole @xcite ) present a bps - type upper bound on their angular momentum , @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 being the mass and @xmath11 the cosmological length ) , while there is no such bound in the asymptotically flat case .",
    "however , the instabilities / bifurcations are still expected as we increase the rotation up to that bound @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : phases ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we will numerically determine the dependence of the stationary threshold modes on the cosmological constant .",
    "the procedure is an extension to @xmath12 of the @xmath13 kerr - ads analysis @xcite , where no classical instability was found ; the latter was itself an extension of the schwarzschild - ads case @xcite .",
    "we confirm the conjecture of ref .",
    "@xcite , which gives a necessary but not sufficient condition for the onset of the ultraspinning instability . in this paper",
    "we generalise the previous formulation so that it can be applied to the asymptotically ads case .",
    "we find that all bifurcations occur when the mp - ads black hole is unstable under superradiance @xcite , which implies that the new families of black holes will inherit this instability .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us mention that asymptotically flat singly - spinning mp black holes also suffer from an instability that breaks their axisymmetry @xcite .",
    "this occurs even in @xmath7 , and for @xmath12 it sets in for lower rotations than the ultraspinning instability that we study here .",
    "however , the threshold mode is not associated to new stationary black holes",
    ". it would be interesting to find whether this non - axisymmetric instability also extends to asymptotically ads black holes and to understand how it relates to the ads superradiant instability .",
    "this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : ultraspin ] , we review the properties of singly - spinning mp - ads black holes and discuss the ultraspinning instability . in section",
    "[ sec : perturbationproblem ] , we detail the linear perturbations problem that is solved numerically . we conclude in section  [ sec : results ] , with the discussion of the results .",
    "in this section , we will start by reviewing the properties of singly - spinning mp - ads black holes .",
    "although for such solution the angular momentum ( at fixed mass ) has an upper bound , we provide a thermodynamic argument , discussed in subsection  [ subsec : ultrathermo ] , according to which these black holes _ may _ be afflicted by the ultraspinning instability .",
    "this motivates the numerical work , described in later sections , of searching for the onset of the instability .",
    "we conclude this section by noting that all the ads black holes potentially afflicted from the ultraspinning instability are also afflicted by the ads superradiant instability .",
    "the four - dimensional kerr - ads black hole was found by carter @xcite , and its extension to higher dimensions , when rotation on a single plane is considered , was obtained by hawking , hunter and taylor @xcite .",
    "the metric is given by @xmath14 ^ 2 + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta_r}\\,dr^2 + \\frac{\\sigma}{\\delta_\\theta}\\,d\\theta^2 \\\\ & + r^2\\cos^2\\theta\\ , d\\omega^2_{(d-4)}\\,,\\label{mpbh } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the line element of a unit - radius @xmath16-sphere and @xmath17 this solution of the einstein equations with negative cosmological constant , @xmath18 , is parameterised by three length scales , namely the ads curvature radius @xmath11 , the mass - radius @xmath19 and the rotation parameter @xmath20 .",
    "the komar mass @xmath10 and angular momentum @xmath21 of the black hole are given in terms of these parameters by @xcite [ mp : mj ] m=(1 + ) , j= a , where @xmath22 $ ] is the volume of a unit - radius @xmath23-sphere , and @xmath24 denotes newton s constant which we set to one ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the solution satisfies the bps - like bound @xcite @xmath26 the metric does not describe a black hole if this bound is saturated . in the limit @xmath27 either the charges ( mass and angular momentum ) and the horizon equator circumference of the black hole diverge , or the horizon vanishes and the solution is nakedly singular .",
    "the event horizon lies at the largest real root @xmath28 of @xmath29 .",
    "the horizon angular velocity measured with respect to a non - rotating frame at infinity is @xcite @xmath30 while the temperature and entropy of the black hole are @xcite @xmath31   + a^2 \\left[d-5 + ( d-3)\\frac{r_+^2}{\\ell^2 } \\right ] \\right ) \\,,\\nonumber\\\\   & & s=\\frac{{\\cal a}_{d-2}}{4}\\frac{(r_+^2+a^2)r_+^{d-4}}{\\xi}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in @xmath13 , the temperature vanishes for @xmath32 .",
    "however , as a consequence of the constraint , we have an extremal regular ( i.e.  with finite size horizon area ) black hole if and only if @xmath33 . in @xmath7 , like in the asymptotically flat space limit @xmath34 , the temperature goes to zero at the singular limit @xmath35 , whereas the bound on the rotation parameter for a finite @xmath36 is . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the temperature can never vanish and thus there is no extremal solution .",
    "the parameter space is bounded only by .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the asymptotically flat case , in which mp black holes rotating on a single plane in @xmath37 have no upper bound on their angular momentum .",
    "the condition of local thermodynamic stability for a black hole with charges @xmath38 and entropy @xmath39 is the positivity of the hessian @xmath40 we write the condition in its most general form , i.e.  taking into account the several angular momenta allowed in higher dimensions , @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 stands for the smallest integer part ) . in this section , we will review the arguments of refs .",
    "@xcite which relate the eigenvalues of this _ thermodynamic _ hessian to the occurrence of _ classical _ instabilities , namely the ultraspinning instability .",
    "there are two general properties of this hessian for ads black holes : ( i ) for all ( non - extremal ) asymptotically flat vacuum black holes , in any @xmath8 , the hessian has at least one negative eigenvalue @xcite ; so , by continuity , black holes whose size is much smaller than the ads curvature radius should be thermodynamically unstable .",
    "( ii ) large black holes in ads , however , are expected to be thermodynamically stable , and thus the hessian should be positive definite .",
    "let us take the @xmath13 kerr - ads case , where we have a @xmath43 thermodynamic hessian .",
    "one of the eigenvalues is positive in the entire parameter space .",
    "however , the second eigenvalue can be negative , null or positive depending on the parameters .",
    "the null point is where the specific heat at constant angular velocity diverges , changing sign .",
    "we shall say that , at the surface in parameter space where the hessian becomes degenerate , we have a _ thermodynamic zero - mode _ , corresponding to the eigenvector with zero eigenvalue .",
    "the situation is analogous in the singly - spinning @xmath7 case ( say @xmath44 ) , with two eigenvalues being always positive , and one changing sign . in the @xmath45 singly - spinning case ( say @xmath46 for @xmath47 ) things are more interesting .",
    "_ two _ of the eigenvalues of the thermodynamic hessian change sign , and all the others remain positive throughout the parameter space .",
    "so there will be two thermodynamic zero - modes , marking the onsets of two distinct local thermodynamic instabilities .",
    "let us consider the parameterisation @xmath48 , which uniquely specifies a singly - spinning mp - ads black hole , for a given ads curvature radius @xmath11 .",
    "recall that @xmath49 is the bound on the parameter space , as represented in figure  [ fig : thermo6d ] for @xmath50 ( it is qualitatively similar in @xmath51 ) . now , for large @xmath52 , the black hole is thermodynamically stable .",
    "as we decrease @xmath36 , one of the eigenvalues changes sign first , which corresponds to the transition between regions @xmath53 and @xmath54 in figure  [ fig : thermo6d ] .",
    "let us label the associated zero - mode as the @xmath55 zero - mode , for reasons that will become apparent later .",
    "its parameter space locus is : larger than .",
    "this implies that hot ads space is preferred ( in the grand - canonical ensemble ) over these black holes if @xmath56 , in any @xmath8 .",
    "global thermodynamic stability is stricter than local thermodynamic stability . ]",
    "@xmath57 where @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath55 zero - mode is present for any @xmath59 .",
    "however , for @xmath37 there is an additional zero - mode , corresponding to the second eigenvalue that becomes negative as we lower @xmath36 for fixed @xmath20 .",
    "this corresponds to the transition between regions @xmath54 and @xmath60 in figure  [ fig : thermo6d ] .",
    "let us label the associated zero - mode with @xmath61 .",
    "its parameter space locus is : @xmath62    what happens as we decrease @xmath36 further for fixed @xmath20 ?",
    "as discussed in the introduction , singly - spinning mp black holes were conjectured to be unstable if rotating too rapidly , i.e. @xmath63 , since they start behaving like black branes @xcite . in the asymptotically ads case",
    ", there should also be an analogous unstable regime @xcite .",
    "now , there can be two types of instabilities .",
    "one for which the perturbations break the rotational symmetry of the background , i.e. the @xmath64 killing vector of ; see @xcite for the analysis of these perturbations in the asymptotically flat case . and one for which the spatial isometries of the background are preserved",
    ". instabilities of the latter type admit stationary threshold modes , which may correspond to bifurcations to new black hole phases @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that an order of magnitude estimate for the critical rotation at the bifurcation point could be given by what we described above as the @xmath61 zero mode .",
    "in fact , this point marks the transition to the black brane - like behaviour and it only occurs for @xmath65 .",
    "the subsequent understanding of the problem allowed for a more precise formulation of the conjecture , which can also be extended beyond the singly - spinning case .    indeed , the _ ultraspinning conjecture _ of ref .",
    "@xcite proposes that instabilities whose onset is a stationary and axisymmetric mode , i.e. a mode which gives a bifurcation to a new stationary black hole family , can only occur after the @xmath55 and @xmath61 zero - modes , i.e. in region @xmath60 of figure  [ fig : thermo6d ] in the present case .",
    "this is a necessary but not sufficient condition .",
    "the reasoning is that the onset of these instabilities corresponds to the @xmath66 zero - modes , as we shall review below .    ref .",
    "@xcite , in the static case , and refs .",
    "@xcite , in the general case , showed that a zero - mode ( or a negative mode , the eigenvector of a negative eigenvalue ) of the thermodynamic hessian is also a stationary and axisymmetric zero - mode ( negative mode ) of the black hole euclidean action .",
    "since we are dealing with stationary and axisymmetric modes , this result extends to the lorentzian action . in the case of a zero - mode",
    ", it corresponds to a classical perturbation of the black hole which preserves its temperature and angular velocities , but changes its asymptotic charges ( mass and angular momenta ) .",
    "the change in the asymptotic charges can simply be inferred from the eigenvector @xmath67 of the hessian associated with the null eigenvalue . in the case of a negative mode",
    ", it corresponds to both : ( i ) an off - shell perturbation of the black hole which makes the ( euclidean ) gravitational partition function pathological , the expected signal of a local thermodynamic instability ; and ( ii ) an on - shell stationary perturbation of a black brane , where the negative eigenvalue corresponds to ( minus ) the ` mass - squared ' coming from the dimensional reduction along the brane directions .",
    "this connection is the basis of the gubser - mitra conjecture @xcite .",
    "the first example of the relation between negative modes of the action and thermodynamic stability was the determination of the negative mode of the schwarzschild black hole @xcite .",
    "the existence of such mode is a direct consequence of the fact the schwarzschild black hole has negative specific heat .",
    "indeed , the extension to the schwarzschild - ads case @xcite showed that the relevant mode changes sign exactly where the specific heat changes sign , as expected .",
    "this result was extended to the kerr - ads case @xcite , where the numerical techniques used in @xcite , and also in this paper , were applied first to a black hole stability problem .",
    "now we can justify the labels @xmath55 and @xmath61 used before , following @xcite .",
    "they are based on the harmonic structure of the metric perturbations corresponding to the zero - modes .",
    "the @xmath55 zero - mode has no nodes , i.e. the metric perturbation does not vanish anywhere on the horizon , whereas the @xmath61 zero - mode has one node , as plotted in @xcite for the singly - spinning mp case .",
    "now , the @xmath55 and @xmath61 zero - modes are associated with the asymptotic charges of the spacetime .",
    ", which have the convenient property of being cohomogeneity-1 .",
    "in that case , the number @xmath68 labels a precise harmonic of the @xmath69 base space , and it can be shown that the @xmath55 harmonic is associated to the mass only ( indeed @xmath70 in the hessian eigenvector ) , while the @xmath61 harmonic is associated to the angular momenta only ( indeed @xmath71 in the hessian eigenvector ) . in the singly - spinning black hole both the @xmath55 and @xmath61 ` harmonics ' change the mass and the angular momentum .",
    "] this is consistent with the fact that they are determined from the thermodynamic hessian , the changes in the charges being proportional to the eigenvector @xmath72 .",
    "notice that , being signalled by the hessian of @xmath73 , i.e. by the equation of state of the background black hole family , the @xmath55 and @xmath61 zero - modes can only change the black hole into another black hole of the _ same _ family , e.g. another mp black hole .",
    "zero - mode breaks the symmetries between the spins , as predicted by the eigenvector @xmath67 having distinct @xmath74",
    ". the zero - mode therefore takes the black hole out of the equal spins sector , but still in the general mp(-ads ) family .",
    "]    what is found by solving the problem of axisymmetric perturbations is that instabilities appear with new stationary zero - modes , not predicted by the thermodynamic hessian .",
    "we refer to them as _ non - thermodynamic _ zero - modes .",
    "their harmonic structure  the number of nodes , found to be @xmath66  is consistent with the deformations of the event horizon proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite ; see figure  [ fig : phases ] .",
    "these higher harmonics can not change the asymptotic charges , as exemplified explicitly in @xcite .",
    "the perturbed black holes will have the same mass and angular momenta as the unperturbed solutions , and also , as imposed by the boundary conditions , the same temperature and angular velocities .",
    "therefore , either they correspond to trivial gauge modes or to bifurcations to new black hole solutions .",
    "we have shown in specific cases @xcite that no regular gauge modes are allowed .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath66 zero - modes mark a black hole bifurcation , and also the onset of a classical ultraspinning instability , one per each mode .",
    "that these linear modes do grow exponentially with time was verified in @xcite .    the ultraspinning conjecture of ref .",
    "@xcite predicts that zero - modes with @xmath66 can only occur for rotations higher than that of the @xmath61 zero - mode . in the case of singly - spinning mp - ads black holes",
    ", this corresponds to the region @xmath60 of figure  [ fig : thermo6d ] .",
    "this is based on the examples known , and on the intuition that higher harmonics should be more stable than lower harmonics .",
    "in general , when several distinct angular momenta are present , several different zero - modes with @xmath61 may exist , as exemplified in @xcite .",
    "so the _ ultraspinning surface _ ( in our case , the surface between @xmath54 and @xmath60 ) is defined as the surface in parameter space which encloses the region where the thermodynamic hessian has less than two negative eigenvalues ( in our case , regions @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) .    since this thermodynamic criterion is a necessary but not sufficient condition , to confirm the presence of these instabilities we still have to solve the linear perturbations problem , and look for the @xmath66 non - thermodynamic zero - modes .",
    "this study is done in section  [ sec : perturbationproblem ] .      before studying the ultraspinning instability of the singly - spinning mp - ads black hole , we recall that this is not the only instability present in the system . indeed , it competes with the well - known superradiant instability that afflicts rotating ads black holes whenever @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the superradiant instability is associated to perturbations that break the symmetry generated by @xmath76 , i.e.  it requires perturbations whose angular momentum quantum number @xmath77 along the @xmath78-direction is non - vanishing .",
    "the mechanism of the instability is simple .",
    "a gravitational wave co - rotating with the background black hole can extract rotational energy from the black hole if its frequency @xmath79 satisfies the relation @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the angular velocity of the black hole .",
    "this phenomenon is known as superradiance . on the other hand , the ads gravitational potential effectively acts as an asymptotically reflecting box .",
    "the multiple superradiant amplifications and reflections drive the system unstable if and only if @xmath75 .",
    "since there is a competition between the two instabilities , it is relevant to ask whether the ultraspinning instability occurs when @xmath82 .",
    "we find a negative answer . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ fig : thermo6d ] we represent the superradiant surface , @xmath83 , by a dashed line .",
    "it lays entirely in region @xmath54 .",
    "black holes above this surface have @xmath84 , which includes all the black holes in region @xmath60 that might also be afflicted by the ultraspinning instability . therefore , all the ads black holes that suffer from the ultraspinning instability that we identify in the next section are also likely to be unstable under superradiance .",
    "in this section , we will detail the linear perturbation problem , which consists in studying the spectrum of the lichnerowicz operator on the black hole background .",
    "we will list the equations to be solved and the boundary conditions , and we will briefly discuss their numerical implementation .      to find the onset of the ultraspinning instability we have to solve the linearised einstein equations with a negative cosmological constant .",

    "this strategy is motivated by the availability of powerful numerical methods for solving eigenvalue equations of the form ( 3.5 ) .",
    "in particular , after an adequate discretisation scheme using spectral methods @xcite , ( 3.5 ) reduces to an algebraic eigenvalue problem which we then solve using the inbuilt routine _ eingenvalues _ of mathematica .      to solve the lichnerowicz eigenvalue system of equations we have to impose boundary conditions on the metric perturbations .",
    "more concretely , we have to specify boundary conditions at the horizon , @xmath28 , at the asymptotic infinity , @xmath109 , at the rotation axis @xmath110 , and at the equator @xmath111 . the strategy to find the appropriate boundary conditions",
    "was already discussed in great detail in section 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the ultraspinning instability in asymptotically flat mp black holes was studied .",
    "the discussion there translates straightforwardly to the present situation , and hence we shall be brief .",
    "we impose regularity of the metric perturbations on the event horizon by demanding regularity of the euclideanised perturbed geometry .",
    "the idea is to peform the standard euclidean continuation of the black hole metric , and find the conditions required to have regularity at the bolt ( euclideanised horizon ) .",
    "for the background black hole , this demands that we identify @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the euclidean time , @xmath114 is the inverse of the black hole temperature , and @xmath81 is its angular velocity .",
    "the boundary conditions for the metric perturbations @xmath88 can now be determined by demanding that @xmath115 is a regular symmetric 2-tensor on the background manifold .",
    "this requires the following boundary conditions at the horizon , located at @xmath116^{1/2}=0 $ ] , @xmath117 note that we have not just imposed regularity of the perturbed metric .",
    "if @xmath115 is a regular 2-tensor , then perturbations obeying preserve the angular velocity and temperature of the background black hole .",
