    "duality in optimization , known as _ lagrange duality _ , plays a key role in designing efficient algorithms for the solution of various optimization problems . in projective geometry , points are dual to hyperplanes , and this leads to a natural notion of _ projective duality _ for algebraic varieties .    our aim here is to explore these dualities and their interconnections in the context of polynomial optimization and semidefinite programming . towards the end of the introduction",
    ", we shall discuss the context and organization of this paper . at this point , however , we jump right in and present a concrete three - dimensional example that illustrates our perspective on these topics .",
    "we consider the following symmetric matrix with three indeterminate entries : @xmath0 this symmetric @xmath1-matrix specifies a @xmath2-dimensional compact convex body @xmath3 the notation `` @xmath4 '' means that the matrix is _ positive semidefinite _ ,",

    "the _ algebraic boundary _ of @xmath6 is the surface specified by the determinant @xmath7    the interior of @xmath6 represents all matrices @xmath8 whose four eigenvalues are positive .",
    "at all smooth points on the boundary of @xmath6 , precisely one eigenvalue vanishes , and the rank of the matrix @xmath8 drops from @xmath9 to @xmath2 .",
    "however , the rank drops further to @xmath10 at the four singular points @xmath11 we find these from a _ grbner basis _ of the ideal of @xmath12-minors of @xmath8 : @xmath13 the linear polynomial @xmath14 in this grbner basis defines the symmetry plane of the pillow @xmath6 .",
    "the four corners form a square in that plane .",
    "its edges are also edges of @xmath6 .",
    "all other faces of @xmath6 are exposed points .",

    "the _ dual _ to ( [ eq::simplesdpp ] ) is the following program with @xmath22 decision variables : @xmath23 since ( [ eq::simplesdpp ] ) and ( [ eq::simplesdpd ] ) are both strictly feasible , strong duality holds @xcite , i.e. the two programs attain the same optimal value : @xmath24 . hence , problem   can be derived from , as we shall see in section  [ sec::sdp ] .    we write @xmath25 for the @xmath1-matrix in ( [ eq::simplesdpd ] ) .",
    "the following equations and inequalities , known as the _ karush - kuhn - tucker conditions _ ( kkt ) , are necessary and sufficient for any pair of optimal solutions : @xmath26 we relax the inequality constraints and consider the system of equations @xmath27 this is a system of @xmath28 equations . using computer algebra , we eliminate the @xmath29 unknowns @xmath30 .",
    "the result is a polynomial in @xmath31 and  @xmath32 .",

    "the optimal value @xmath33 is one of the two solutions of @xmath36 in the latter case it comes from the four corners of the pillow , and it satisfies @xmath37 these two equations describe the algebraic boundary of the dual body @xmath5 .",
    "namely , after setting @xmath38 , the irreducible polynomial in ( [ eq : lambdadual1 ] ) describes the quartic surface that makes up the curved part of the boundary of @xmath5 , as seen in figure [ fig : honest_pillow ] .",
    "in addition , there are four planes spanned by flat @xmath10-dimensional faces of @xmath5 .",
    "the product of the four corresponding affine - linear forms equals ( [ eq : lambdadual2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , each of the two quadrics in ( [ eq : lambdadual2 ] ) factors into two linear factors .",
    "these two characterize the planes spanned by opposite @xmath10-faces of @xmath5 .",
    "the two equations ( [ eq : lambdadual1 ] ) and ( [ eq : lambdadual2 ] ) also offer a first glimpse at the concept of _ projective duality _ in algebraic geometry . namely , consider the surface in projective space @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 after replacing the ones along the diagonals by a homogenization variable . then ( [ eq : lambdadual1 ] ) is its dual surface in the dual projective space @xmath41 . the surface ( [ eq : lambdadual2 ] ) in @xmath41 is dual to the @xmath18-dimensional variety in @xmath39 cut out by the @xmath42-minors of @xmath8 .",

    "spectrahedral shadows_. these objects play a prominent role in the interplay between semidefinite programming and convex algebraic geometry .",
    "the dual body to a spectrahedron is generally not a spectrahedron , but it is always a spectrahedral shadow .      duality is a central concept in convexity and convex optimization , and numerous authors have written about their connections and their interplay with other notions of duality and polarity .",
    "relevent references include barvinok s text book @xcite and the survey by luenberger @xcite .",
    "the latter focuses on dualities used in engineering , such as duality of vector spaces , polytopes , graphs , and control systems .",
    "the objective of this article is to revisit the theme of duality in the context of _ convex algebraic geometry_. this emerging field aims to exploit algebraic structure in convex optimization problems , specifically in semidefinite programming and polynomial optimization . in algebraic geometry , there is a natural notion of projective duality , which associates to every algebraic variety a dual variety .",

    "the various dualities are carefully defined and their basic properties are illustrated by means of examples . in section  [ sec::opt_value ]",
    "we derive the result that the optimal value function of a polynomial program is represented by the defining equation of the hypersurface projectively dual to the manifold describing the boundary of all feasible solutions .",
    "this highlights the important fact that the duality best known to algebraic geometers arises very naturally in convex optimization .",
    "section  [ sec::convex_hull ] concerns the convex hull of a compact algebraic variety in @xmath44 .",
    "we discuss recent work of ranestad and sturmfels @xcite on the hypersurfaces in the boundary of such a convex body , and we present several new examples and applications .",
    "in section  [ sec::sdp ] we focus on semidefinite programming ( sdp ) , and we offer a concise geometric introduction to sdp duality .",
    "this leads to the concept of algebraic degree of sdp @xcite , or , geometrically , to projective duality for varieties defined by rank constraints on symmetric matrices of linear forms .",
    "a _ spectrahedral shadow _ is the image of a spectrahedron under a linear projection .",
    "its dual body is a linear section of the dual body to the spectrahedron . in section  [ sec::spec_shadow ]",
    "we examine this situation in the context of sums - of - squares programming , and we discuss linear families of non - negative polynomials .",
    "in this section we review the mathematical preliminaries needed for the rest of the paper , we give precise definitions , and we fix more of the notation .",
    "we begin with the notion of duality for vector spaces and cones therein , then move on to convex bodies , polytopes , lagrange duality in optimization , the kkt conditions , projective duality in algebraic geometry , and discriminants .",
    "we fix an ordered field @xmath45 .",
    "the primary example is the field of real numbers , @xmath46 , but it makes much sense to also allow other fields , such as the rational numbers @xmath47 or the real puiseux series @xmath48 . for a finite dimensional @xmath45-vector space @xmath49 , the dual vector space is the set @xmath50 of all linear forms on @xmath49 .",
    "let @xmath49 and @xmath51 be vector spaces and @xmath52 a linear map .",
    "the _ dual map _",
    "@xmath53 is the linear map defined by @xmath54 for every @xmath55 .",
    "if we fix bases of @xmath49 and @xmath51 then @xmath56 is represented by a matrix @xmath57 .",
    "the dual map @xmath58 is represented , relative to the dual bases for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , by the _",
    "@xmath61 of the matrix  @xmath57 .",
    "a subset @xmath62 is a _ cone _ if it is closed under multiplication with positive scalars . a cone @xmath63 need not be convex , but its _ dual cone _",
    "@xmath64 is always closed and convex in @xmath60 . if @xmath63 is a _ convex cone",
    "_ then the second dual @xmath65 is the closure of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , if @xmath63 is a closed convex cone in @xmath49 then @xmath66 this important relationship is referred to as _",
    "biduality_.    every linear subspace @xmath67 is also a cone .",
    "its dual cone is the orthogonal complement of the subspace : @xmath68 the dual map to the inclusion @xmath67 is the projection @xmath69 . given any cone @xmath70 , the intersection @xmath71 is a cone in @xmath72 .",
    "its dual cone @xmath73 is the projection of the cone @xmath63 into @xmath74 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath75 now , it makes sense to consider this convex set modulo @xmath76 .",
    "we thus obtain @xmath77 this identity shows that projection and intersections are dual operations .    a subset @xmath78 of a convex set @xmath63 is a _ face _ if @xmath79 is itself convex and contains any line segment @xmath80 whose relative interior intersects @xmath79 .",
    "we say that @xmath79 is an _ exposed face _ if there exists a linear functional @xmath81 that attains its minimum over @xmath63 precisely at @xmath79 . clearly , an exposed face is a face , but the converse does not hold .",
    "for instance , the edges of the red triangle in figure  [ fig::trigonometric ] are non - exposed faces of the @xmath2-dimensional convex body shown there .",
    "an exposed face @xmath79 of a cone @xmath63 determines a face of the dual cone @xmath82 via @xmath83 the dimensions of the faces @xmath79 of @xmath63 and @xmath84 of @xmath82 satisfy the inequality @xmath85 if @xmath63 is a polyhedral cone then @xmath82 is also polyhedral . in that case , the number of faces @xmath79 and @xmath84 is finite and equality holds in ( [ eq : dimformula ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "most cones considered in this article are not polyhedral , they have infinitely many faces , and the inequality in ( [ eq : dimformula ] ) is usually strict . for instance , the _ second order cone _",
    "@xmath86 is self - dual , each proper face @xmath79 of @xmath63 is @xmath17-dimensional , and the formula ( [ eq : dimformula ] ) says @xmath87 .      a _ convex body _ in @xmath49 is a full - dimensional convex set that is closed and bounded .",
    "if @xmath63 is a cone and @xmath88 then @xmath89 is a convex body in the hyperplane @xmath90 of @xmath49 . in this manner ,",
    "every pointed @xmath91-dimensional cone gives rise to a @xmath92-dimensional convex body , and vice versa .",
    "these transformations , known as _ homogenization _ and _ dehomogenization _ , respect faces and algebraic boundaries .",
    "they allow us to go back and fourth between convex bodies and cones in the next higher dimension .",
    "for instance , the @xmath2-dimensional body @xmath6 in ( [ eq::simplespectrahedron ] ) corresponds to the cone in @xmath93 we get by multiplying the constants @xmath17 on the diagonal in ( [ eq : matrixq ] ) with a new variable .",
    "let @xmath6 be a full - dimensional convex body in @xmath49 and assume that @xmath94 .",
    "dehomogenizing the definition for cones , we obtain the _ dual convex body _ @xmath95",
    "this is derived from using the identification @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "just as in the case of convex cones , if @xmath6 is closed then biduality holds : @xmath98 the definition ( [ eq : pdelta ] ) makes sense for arbitrary subsets @xmath6 of @xmath49 . that is",
    ", @xmath6 need not be convex or closed . a standard fact from convex analysis (",
    "12.1.1 and  14 ) says that the double dual is the closure of the convex  hull : @xmath99    all convex bodies discussed in this article are _ semialgebraic _ , that is , they can be described by polynomial inequalities .",
    "we note that if @xmath6 is semialgebraic then its dual body @xmath5 is also semialgebraic .",
    "this is a consequence of tarski s theorem on quantifier elimination in real algebraic geometry @xcite .",
    "the _ algebraic boundary _ of a semialgebraic convex body @xmath6 , denoted @xmath100 , is the smallest algebraic variety that contains the boundary @xmath101 . in geometric language",

    "namely , @xmath103 is the zero set of the polynomial @xmath102 . note that @xmath102 is unique up to a multiplicative constant .",
    "thus @xmath100 is an algebraic hypersurface which contains the boundary @xmath101 .",
    "a _ polytope _ is the convex hull of a finite subset of @xmath49 . if @xmath6 is a polytope then",

    "we now come to a standard concept of duality in optimization theory .",

    "this function is always concave , so the dual is always a convex optimization problem .",
    "it follows from the definition of the dual function that @xmath150 for all @xmath151 .",
    "hence the optimal values satisfy the inequality @xmath152 if equality happens , @xmath153 , then we say that _ strong duality _ holds . a necessary condition for strong duality is @xmath154 for all @xmath155 , where @xmath156 denote the primal and dual optimizer .",
