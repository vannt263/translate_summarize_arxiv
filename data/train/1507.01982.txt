    "the operating frequency bands of communication and radar systems often overlap , causing one system to exert interference to the other .",

    "spectrum sharing is a new line of work that targets at enabling radar and communication systems to share the spectrum efficiently by minimizing interference effects @xcite .",
    "this paper investigates the problem of spectrum sharing between a mimo communication system and a matrix completion ( mc ) based colocated mimo radar ( mimo - mc ) system @xcite .",
    "mimo radars transmit orthogonal waveforms from their multiple transmit ( tx ) antennas , and their receive ( rx ) antennas forward their measurements to a fusion center for further processing .",
    "the rx antenna measurements could be samples of the target returns , or could be the outputs of matched filters .",
    "based on the forwarded data , the fusion center populates a matrix , referred to as the  data matrix \" , which is then used by standard array processing schemes for target estimation .",
    "when the target returns are sampled at the nyquist rate , and for a relatively small number of targets , the data matrix is low - rank @xcite , thus , under certain conditions it can be reconstructed based on a small , uniformly sampled set of its entries .",
    "this observation is the basis of mimo - mc radars @xcite , in which the rx antennas forward to the fusion center a small number of pseudo - randomly obtained samples of the target returns , or the result of matched filtering with a set of randomly selected transmit waveforms , along with information on the sampling scheme , with each rx antenna partially filling a row of the data matrix .",
    "subsequently , the full data matrix is recovered using mc techniques .",
    "mimo - mc radars maintain the high resolution of mimo radars , while requiring significantly fewer data to be communicated to the fusion center , thus enabling savings in communication power and bandwidth .",
    "these savings are especially important when the rx antennas are on battery operated nodes , and/or the communication to the fusion center occurs in a wireless fashion .",
    "compared to compressive sensing ( cs ) based mimo radars , mimo - mc radars achieve data reduction while avoiding the basis mismatch issues which were inherent in cs - based approaches @xcite .    in this paper , the mimo - mc radar system is considered as the primary user of the channel , while the mimo communication system is the secondary user .",
    "_ first _ , for a fixed uniformly random radar sub - sampling scheme , the communication system optimally designs its transmit covariance matrix so that its effective interference power ( eip ) exerted to the radar rx node is minimized , while its own average capacity and transmit power are kept at a prescribed level . in doing so , two approaches are proposed , namely , a cooperative and a noncooperative approach , with the latter being applicable when the communication system has knowledge of the mimo - mc radar sampling instances .",
    "it is shown that when the mimo - mc radar sampling scheme is known to the communication system , the eip can be greatly reduced , especially at low sub - sampling rates .",
    "_ second _ , a joint - design of the radar sampling scheme and the communication system transmit covariance matrix is proposed , targeting at minimizing the eip at the radar rx node .",
    "alternating optimization is employed to solve the optimization problem .",
    "the candidate sampling scheme needs to be such that the resulting data matrix can be completed .",
    "recent work @xcite showed that for matrix completion , the sampling locations should correspond to a binary matrix with large spectral gap .",
    "since the spectral gap of a matrix is not affected by column and row permutations , we propose to search for the optimum sampling matrix among matrices which are row and column permutations of an initial sampling matrix with large spectrum gap .",
    "even before any design is implemented , the mimo - mc radar system is expected to be less susceptible to interference than a plain mimo radar ; this is because the interference affects only some entries of the data matrix . as it is shown in the paper , by appropriately designing the communication tx waveforms and/or the radar sampling scheme ,",

    "<S> recently proposed multiple input multiple output radars based on matrix completion ( mimo - mc ) employ sparse sampling to reduce the amount of data that need to be forwarded to the radar fusion center , and as such enable savings in communication power and bandwidth . </S>",
    "<S> this paper proposes designs that optimize the sharing of spectrum between a mimo - mc radar and a communication system , so that the latter interferes minimally with the former . </S>",
    "<S> first , the communication system transmit covariance matrix is designed to minimize the effective interference power ( eip ) to the radar receiver , while maintaining certain average capacity and transmit power for the communication system . </S>",
    "<S> two approaches are proposed , namely a noncooperative and a cooperative approach , with the latter being applicable when the radar sampling scheme is known at the communication system . </S>",
    "<S> second , a joint design of the communication transmit covariance matrix and the mimo - mc radar sampling scheme is proposed , which achieves even further eip reduction .    </S>",
