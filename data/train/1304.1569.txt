    "the concept of a _ globule _ was introduced as early as in 1940s for ` dark nebulae '  opaque compact clouds with sharply delineated boundaries on the background of emission nebulae . described for the first time by @xcite and @xcite , cometary globules ( cgs )",
    "are characterised by cometlike morphology  a compact opaque dust ` head ' , frequently surrounded by a bright rim , and a long dust ` tail ' .",
    "it is supposed that such a shape of cgs is formed as a result of the action of ultraviolet radiation @xcite and/or of shock waves initiated by supernovae or stellar winds ( @xcite ) on small dense clouds immersed in a rarefied medium . as a rule ,",
    "cgs tails are oriented radially from the source that has formed them .",
    "the problem of the origin of cgs is still discussed .",
    "the study of their nature is of special interest because of their connection with the process of star formation : in heads of many globules compact ir sources  young stellar objects ( ysos )  have been detected .",

    "dense dust clouds and their ` fine structure ' , formed by radiation and wind from young stars and determining the process of formation of a new generation of stars , are studied today very intensely using ir observations .",

    "the spatial distribution of ir emission in different spectral bands revealed a clear picture of continuing star formation in dust pillars , which result from the action of young stars on the remnants of the parent molecular cloud .",

    "the family of cometary globules in the region @xmath7@xmath8 ; @xmath9@xmath10 was detected in the infrared using observational data of the _ spitzer _ space observatory obtained from the _ spitzer _ legacy survey of the cygnus - x complex ( @xcite , ` http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/cygnusx ` ) .",
    "the archival data were downloaded from the _ spitzer _ heritage archive .",
    "we had at our disposal images of the region in five wavebands : 3.6  @xmath2 m , 4.5  @xmath2 m , 5.8  @xmath2 m , 8.0  @xmath2 m observed with the infrared array camera ( irac ) and 24  @xmath2 m with the multi - band imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) .",

    "figures  [ fig1]abc show the images of the region in the 3.6 , 8 and 24  @xmath2 m bands .",
    "it is visible that the family of ir globules consists of several lined in a chain , identically oriented cgs with sizes from @xmath11 to 7  arcmin .",
    "the morphology of the ir globules in all the wavebands is the same as a whole .",
    "( the ` blurred ' image in the 24  @xmath2 m band is due to a lower resolution and , probably , to the fact that heated dust responsible for the main emission in this band can be present also in the neighbourhood of the globules . )",

    "a typical b(56)v star delivers much less photons in the range @xmath26   ; therefore , the h@xmath0 line can not be produced by a process of photoionization followed by recombination .",
    "as will be shown below , hbha 3703 - 01 may be classified as the herbig ae / be star . the origin of the emission lines in such stars is still under discussion .    in the spectrum of ionized gas , along the entire spectrograph slit ( @xmath278  arcmin ) , the emission lines h@xmath28 , [ oiii ] @xmath29  4959 ,",

    "the reflection nebula gm  2 - 39 has a diameter of about 30  arcsec and is well seen in the optical and infrared , but it is invisible on our spectrograms owing to its low surface brightness .",
    "the emission spectrum of ionized gas of the surroundings is due by its origin to the general field of ultraviolet radiation of the hot stars wr  139 , hd  193595 and hd  228841 .",

    "the object hbha 3703 - 01 was observed also during the 2mass survey ( its catalogue i d is 20170810 + 3859295 ) ; its @xmath45 magnitudes are , respectively , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the large colour index , @xmath49 , tells that the star has an excess of ir emission most likely associated with a hot ( @xmath501000  k ) circumstellar gas - dust envelope .",
    "in addition , observations of hbha 3703 - 01 were obtained by the _",
    "akari _ infrared satellite @xcite .",
    "according to these data , the fluxes from hbha  3703 - 01 in the 65 , 90 , 140 and 160-@xmath2 m bands ( in units of @xmath39  erg  @xmath20s@xmath16@xmath16 ) are @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "integration of sed in the 65160-@xmath2 m range indicates that the total emission of dust in this range exceeds the luminosity of the central star by a factor of a few .",
    "such a large flux may be due to the low angular resolution of _ akari _ ( 12  arcmin ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to the circumstellar envelope , its field of view covers an appreciable part of the dust cloud visible on the 24-@xmath2 m image and heated by the radiation field of the cyg  ob1 stars .",
    "thus , the _ akari _ fluxes refer not only to the emission of the circumstellar envelope of hbha  3703 - 01 but also to the nebula gm  2 - 39 and to some part of its environment . in what follows",
    "we do not consider these fluxes .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] shows the sed of hbha 3703 - 01 in the 0.4424-@xmath2 m spectral range plotted together with our photometric data and 2mass ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) , as well as fluxes from the _ spitzer _ images ( 3.524  @xmath2 m ) .",
    "the figure also shows the 821-@xmath2 m _ msx _ mission data @xcite .",
    "all fluxes were corrected for interstellar extinction that corresponds to @xmath58  mag using the extinction law from @xcite .",
    "this value is less than the one used above in the estimation of the spectral type of the star , since some part of the extinction toward the central source may be due to the circumstellar envelope .",
    "the sed of hbha 3703 - 01 taking into account the circumstellar dust envelope was calculated using the csdust3 software , which was described in detail by @xcite .",
    "we have done the following assumptions :    \\1 .",
    "the dust envelope was considered to be spherically symmetric with inner and outer radii @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the dust density distribution in the envelope was set as @xmath61 .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of the b(56)v central star was assumed to be blackbody with temperature @xmath62 = 15,000 k and luminosity @xmath63 .",
    "precisely this luminosity is obtained with a distance of 1.5  kpc and with the observed bolometric flux .",
    "the dust envelope consists of amorphous silicate and graphite particles with radius @xmath64 , @xmath65 and number densities @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the factors of efficiency of absorption and scattering were calculated in accordance with the theory of @xcite for spherical particles .",
    "the refractive index of the material of the particles was taken from @xcite . in the calculations we determined the optical depth of the envelope at a wavelength of 0.55  @xmath2 m ( @xmath68 ) , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and the exponent @xmath0 in the dust density distribution law .",
    "figure  [ fig8 ] presents the calculated sed of the object hbha  3703 - 01 , which was obtained under the above assumptions .",
    "m range ( squares ) , _ msx _ data ( triangle ) and calculated energy distribution ( solid curve ) . ]",
    "the best agreement between the computed and observed sed is achieved for the following parameters : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71  @xmath2 m , @xmath72  @xmath2 m , @xmath66/@xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75  k.    thus , in the circumstellar dust envelope of hbha  3703 - 01 silicate particles prevail .",
    "the silicate dust temperature at the inner boundary of the envelope is @xmath76=1350  k. exponent @xmath77 in the dust density distribution law is a typical value in accreting envelopes of herbig ae / be stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the total mass of the dust envelope radiating in the considered spectral range is @xmath78 . for the ratio",
    "@xmath79 this yields the total mass of the circumstellar envelope @xmath80 . note that the estimated mass of the envelope depends on the outer radius of the envelope ; finding the envelope mass requires far - infrared observations with a high angular resolution .",
    "therefore , we estimate only the mass of the material radiating in the wavelength range @xmath81  @xmath2 m .",
    "thus , the object hbha 3703 - 01 located at the center of the diffuse nebula gm  2 - 39 , in the region of the southern head of the ir globule , is a b(56)ve star with a dust envelope , whose temperature at the inner boundary is about 1400  k. the star illuminates the nebula gm  2 - 39 .",
    "the nebula gm  2 - 39 is distinguished from the ambient background of the molecular cloud just because of the presence of the above - mentioned star .",
    "thus , the star hbha  3703 - 01 satisfies completely the criteria for herbig ae / be stars @xcite : ( 1 )  spectral type of a or earlier with emission lines , ( 2 )  location in an ` obscured region ' and ( 3 )  the star would illuminate a bright reflection nebulosity in its vicinity .    in the area studied , no strong centimetre - wavelength radio continuum source is present that could be associated with a compact ionized region .",
    "only one compact radio source has been detected there , mitg j201703 + 3900 @xcite with flux density @xmath82  mjy at @xmath83  ghz .",
    "most probably , it is a nonthermal extragalactic source , its spectral index @xmath0 ( @xmath84 ) in the 1.45  ghz interval is @xmath852.32 .",
    "our study of the interstellar medium toward a family of cometary globules detected in the archival data of the _ spitzer _ space observatory in the region of a supershell in cygnus allow us to draw the following conclusions .",
    "the analysis of kinematics of the interstellar medium in the neighbourhood of the family of cgs and of the stellar population in the regions suggests a physical association between cgs and the cyg  ob1 association at a distance of 1.5  kpc .",
    "( ionized hydrogen and co molecular clouds near the family of cgs have velocity @xmath86  km  s@xmath16 ; the median radial velocity of the stars of cyg  ob1 is @xmath87  km  s@xmath16 . )    the considered family of globules can be a remnant of a pillar directed toward the centre of the cyg  ob1 association .",
    "the pillar is decaying in the process of star formation under the action of ionizing radiation and wind of the stars of cyg  ob1 .",
    "the family of cgs is within the zone covered by the wind and ionizing radiation of the of stars hd 228841 and hd 193595 belonging to cyg  ob1 .",
    "the chain of cgs extends radially with respect to these stars .",
    "the morphology of cgs in the ir bands is as a whole consistent with the optical images : dust head and tail bordered with bright ir and/or optical rims .",
    "the optical emission encircles the bright ir globules .",
    "the ambient ionized gas is characterized by high - velocity features in the h@xmath0 line ( up to 6080  km  s@xmath16 with respect to the systematic velocity ) ; this is a consequence of the action of the wind from these stars .",
    "the gas swept out by the wind circumflows the family of cometary globules , since high velocities are observed along the entire chain of cgs .",
    "we have found no obvious kinematic signs of braking of the high - velocity gas at the interaction with the ` three - headed globule ' .",
    "indirect indications to the interaction of the wind from the star and the family of cgs can be the presence of a co cavern surrounding the eastern globules and fine ir filaments curled away from the stars .",
    "we have observed a compact stellar object in the southern head of the brightest globule  the star hbha  3703 - 01 identified with the infrared source iras  20153 + 3850 .",
    "our multicolour photometric observations allow us to estimate the spectral type of hbha 3703 - 01 as b(56)v and to measure its colour excess @xmath88  mag .",
    "low - resolution spectral observations of hbha  3703 - 01 have revealed the broad h@xmath0 emission with @xmath89   , which corresponds to a high velocity , @xmath90  km  s@xmath16 .",
    "the absolute visual magnitude of the star obtained under the assumption that the star belongs to the cyg  ob1 starburst complex locates it on the h - r diagram near zams in the region of herbig ae / be objects .",
    "hbha  3703 - 01 is surrounded by the reflection nebula gm  2 - 39 ; its diameter is about @xmath91 .",
    "the nebula is distinguished against the background of the overall molecular cloud just because of the presence of the star , which illuminates a part of the interstellar medium nearest to the star and results in the formation of an optical reflection nebula .    using archival data of observations of hbha 3703 - 01 obtained by the _",
    "space telescope , we have estimated the fluxes in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.6 , 8 and 24  @xmath2 m bands .",
    "( on all ir images hbha  3703 - 01 looks as a starlike object surrounded with a nebula ; the emission of this nebula is subtracted from the measured fluxes . )",
    "we have also used our photometric data for hbha 3703 - 01 together with the 2mass magnitudes ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) . according to these data ,",
    "we have derived the sed of hbha  3703 - 01 in the 0.4424  @xmath2 m range .",
    "all observations were corrected for the interstellar extinction with @xmath92  mag .",
    "the obtained sed can be rather well described within the framework of the model of emission of the central source ( a blackbody with temperature @xmath93  k ) surrounded by a dust envelope with parameters listed above .",
    "the derived dust density distribution in the envelope @xmath74 is typical of the envelopes of herbig ae / be stars .",
