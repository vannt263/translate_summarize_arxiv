    "ballistic conductors are characterized by an active region where carriers , once injected by contacts , move without suffering any scattering from contact to contact , i.e. the carrier mean free path is much longer than the sample characteristic dimensions . in metals ,",
    "ballistic transport is usually studied in point contacts.@xcite such contacts allow the analysis of elastic and inelastic scattering processes by means of the so called point contact spectroscopy.@xcite since the fermi wavelength in metals is very small ( @xmath1 ) , the nature of carrier transport is semiclassical and quantum effects related to the wave nature of the electrons can be disregarded . in semiconductors , ballistic transport has been investigated in bulk materials,@xcite point contacts@xcite and two dimensional electron gases;@xcite some studies have allowed the development of ballistic emission spectroscopy@xcite for the analysis of semiconductor heterointerfaces .",
    "moreover , a variety of ballistic electron devices with promising performances have been realized@xcite or proposed.@xcite since the fermi wave length in semiconductors can be as large as 40 @xmath2 , the nature of the carrier transport can be either semiclassical or quantum depending on the characteristic sample dimensions , @xmath3 , with respect to the fermi wave length , @xmath4 . for @xmath5 transport",
    "is semiclassical , while for @xmath6 transport is quantum .    from a fundamental point of view",
    ", the study of non - equilibrium electronic noise ( shot noise)@xcite of ballistic conductors in the semiclassical transport regime offers a unique scenario where the simultaneous effect of two fundamental physical interactions , namely the long range coulomb interaction and the pauli exclusion principle , can be investigated . on the one hand ,",
    "pauli correlations have an influence on the carrier injecting statistics at the contacts . on the other hand",
    ", coulomb correlations can modify the carrier passing statistics inside the active regions .",
    "the effect of both mechanisms results in values of the current noise below the full poissonian value , i.e. in shot - noise suppression .",
    "thus , the non - equilibrium low frequency current spectral density is given by @xmath7 , with @xmath8 being the current flowing trough the sample and @xmath9 a dimensionless parameter ( fano factor ) which takes values below unity because of the negative correlations induced by both mechanisms .",
    "the relative relevance of coulomb and pauli suppression in determining the fano factor depends on parameters like the sample length , the temperature , the carrier density or the applied voltage , thus allowing the monitoring of both correlation mechanisms .",
    "the first theoretical analyses on the non - equilibrium noise properties of ballistic conductors were performed by van der ziel and bosman in @xmath10 ballistic semiconductor diodes@xcite and by kulik and omelyanchuk in ballistic metallic point contacts.@xcite in the former case , by considering non - degenerate injection conditions , only the effect of the coulomb correlations was evidenced . in particular , by using ideas borrowed from north s theory of vacuum",
    "tubes,@xcite it was shown that under space charge conditions current noise results suppressed below the full poissonian value ( see also refs . [ ] ) . in the later case ,",
    "the high carrier density of metals prevented the presence of significant space charge effects , and hence the possibility to test the effect of the long range coulomb correlations . in this case , by means of a selfconsistent semiclassical kinetic theory based on the boltzmann - langevin equation,@xcite which included the effects of the pauli principle , it was shown that in the collision free regime ballistic metallic point contacts displayed nyquist noise with low frequency current spectral density given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath13 the temperature and @xmath14 the sharvin contact resistance , with @xmath15 being the electron effective mass , @xmath16 the fermi velocity , @xmath17 the unit charge , and @xmath18 the carrier concentration inside the sample .",
    "this result is applied in the physical limit where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and arbitrary relation between @xmath19 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the applied bias and @xmath23 the fermi energy .",
    "these initial studies did not allowed the study of the simultaneous effect of both pauli and coulomb correlation mechanisms .",
    "it was only very recently that ballistic structures including the simultaneous effect of pauli and coulomb correlations have been analyzed.@xcite by making use of a semi - analytical approach,@xcite monte carlo ( mc ) simulations,@xcite and an asymptotic analytical approach,@xcite non - equilibrium noise properties of ballistic semiconductor structures have been investigated .",
    "it was shown that these structures , by allowing both space charge effects and degenerate injection statistics , were unique in order to study the simultaneous effect of both pauli and coulomb correlations.@xcite however , the existing studies , being only valid under some limit conditions or performed for some specific sets of system parameters , do not offer a complete overview of the relative relevance of pauli and coulomb correlations in the whole range of system parameters and applied bias .",
    "this lack of a general overview can prevent the designing of suitable experimental strategies to test the theoretical predictions .",
    "the aim of the present work is precisely to address this issue .    to this purpose",
    "we work out a general theory for the low frequency shot - noise properties of ballistic @xmath0 semiconductor diodes that consistently describes also current - voltage characteristics .",
    "we consider ligthly doped bulk semiconductor materials since at low temperatures the bulk electrons are trapped by their parent donors , neutralizing them and thus minimizing both the @xmath24 interaction and ionized impurity scattering , thus allowing long mean free paths up to relatively high electron energies.@xcite the theory presented accounts for both the pauli exclusion principle and the long range coulomb interaction , and is applied to the whole range of system parameters ( sample length , temperature , contact doping ) and external bias .",
    "in particular , the theory allows us to study in a unifying framework the transition from : ( i ) nondegenerate to degenerate injection conditions , ( ii ) short to ( asymptotically ) long sample lengths and , ( iii ) low to ( asymptotically ) high applied voltages . by overcoming the limitations of the previous existing theories ,",
    "the present study allows us to compress into a general scheme the full scenario displayed by the pauli and coulomb correlations in these ballistic structures .",
    "this scheme , validated and tested with a wide set of mc simulations , is believed to be of relevant assistance in designing future investigations on an experimental and/or simulation basis .",

    "[ solution ] the analytical expressions obtained for the transport and noise properties are reported , and their validity is checked by means of mc simulations . in sec .",
    "[ general ] we propose a general scheme able to provide a systematic physical picture of the shot - noise properties of two - terminal ballistic conductors , and check its reliability by means of the developed theory . finally , in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] we summarize the main results of the paper .",
    "the appendix is devoted to technical derivations .",
    "the system under study is the @xmath0 ballistic semiconductor diode showed in fig .",
    "[ figsystem ] .",
    "it consists of an undoped semiconductor of length @xmath3 , where injected carriers move in the total absence of scattering events , sandwiched between two highly doped regions which act as ideal injecting contacts as specified later .",
    "the contacts and the ballistic region are taken of the same material ( homodiode ) or of different material ( heterodiode ) . in the former case the band offset @xmath25 @xmath26 ( a symmetric structure",
    "is assumed for simplicity ) vanishes , while in the later case it takes a finite value .",
    "the ballistic region is taken to be perfectly coupled with the contacts , thus no reflections take place at the interfaces .",
    "the contacts are assumed to be in quasiequilibrium at the given temperature , and at electrochemical potentials @xmath27 and @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "the voltage drop in the contacts is assumed to be negligibly small ( ohmic contacts ) , and hence all the band bending occurs in the active region of the sample . under these assumptions ,",
    "the effective contact chemical potential @xmath30 , defined as @xmath31 is independent of the applied bias . note that for the case of an homodiode @xmath30 coincides with the contact fermi energy , @xmath32 , while for the case of an heterodiode one has @xmath33 .",
    "we note the existence of a maximum with amplitude @xmath34 in the potential energy along the active region due to the presence of space charge .",
    "the structure is assumed to be sufficiently thick in the transversal directions so as to allow for a 1d electrostatic treatment .",
    "thus the system is 1d in real space and 3d in momentum space.@xcite the carriers are injected into the active region in accordance with the equilibrium fermi - dirac distribution function and satisfying the pauli exclusion principle , thus following the corresponding binomial injection statistics.@xcite for simplicity , a single spherical parabolic band is assumed .",
    "the parameters describing the model system introduced above are therefore the length of the conductor , @xmath3 , the cross sectional area @xmath35 , the effective contact chemical potential , @xmath30 , the temperature , @xmath13 , the static dielectric constant of the medium , @xmath36 , the electron effective mass , @xmath15 , and the charge carriers @xmath17 .",
    "the independent - variable parameter is the applied voltage , @xmath22 .    as mentioned above , the correlations between different current pulses in the present system is twofold .",
    "on the one hand , pauli correlations have an influence on the contact injecting statistics .",
    "carriers above the fermi energy , at the tail of the fermi distribution at the contacts , are injected obeying poissonian statistics due to the negligible influence of the pauli principle at such high energies .",
    "carriers near and below the fermi energy are injected following a binomial ( sub - poissonian ) statistics due to the increasing influence of the pauli principle at the highly occupied states . on the other hand , coulomb correlations , through the potential energy maximum @xmath34 associated with the presence of space charge , can modify the carrier passing statistics inside the active region . indeed , the fluctuations of @xmath34 originated by the passage of carriers over the maximum modulate the transmission of further carriers ( spacing them out more regularly in time ) and smooth out the current fluctuations imposed by the random injection at the contacts .",
    "the relative importance of the two types of correlating mechanisms depends on the values of @xmath3 , @xmath30 and @xmath22 .",
    "within a semiclassical approach the description of the transport and noise properties of the system under study can be carried out by means of the vlasov equation , self - consistently coupled to the poisson equation , and supplemented by appropriate _ fluctuating _",
    "boundary conditions.@xcite in the one dimensional approximation followed here , the vlasov - poisson system of equations reads ( in dimensionless units , as specified later ) : @xmath37 f(x , v_{x},t)=0\\text { , }   \\label{vlasov}\\ ] ] @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the time variable , @xmath40 the spatial coordinate , @xmath41 the velocity in the @xmath40 direction , @xmath42 the potential energy , @xmath43 the distribution function integrated over transversal momentum directions and @xmath44 the carrier density . in the poisson equation",
    "the contribution of the intrinsic free carrier density is neglected in comparison to the injected carriers . moreover ,",
    "the boundary conditions for the potential energy read @xmath45 where we have assumed that the applied bias is fixed by a low impedance external circuit so that neither the electric potential nor the contact potential energies fluctuates , i.e. , @xmath46 .",
    "accordingly , the boundary conditions for the distribution function at the contacts read : @xmath47 these boundary conditions consist of two contributions .",
    "the first is of deterministic nature , and gives the average value of the distribution function .",
    "the second is of stochastic nature , and describes the random injection of carriers .",
    "the average distribution function is given by : @xmath48 with @xmath49 and @xmath50 being the longitudinal and transversal kinetic energy , respectively , and where @xmath51 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "note that due to the integration over the transverse momentum directions the effective one dimensional contact distribution function is @xmath52 instead of @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , the fluctuating contributions @xmath54 and @xmath55 have zero mean and low frequency spectral density given by@xcite @xmath56 equations ( [ vlasov])-([fccorr ] ) constitute the complete set of equations to study the noise properties of the ballistic structure described in sec .  [ system ]    in the previous set of equations , and in what follows , we use dimensionless variables to simplify the notation .",
    "the dimensionalizing factors used for energy , length , carrier density , velocity , distribution function , electric potential , electric field , electric current , resistance and current spectral density are , respectively ,    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the planck constant . with these dimensionalizing factors the dimensionless parameters describing",
    "the system are @xmath59 @xmath3 and @xmath60 , and the dimensionless independent variable is @xmath61 .",
    "the physical meaning of the different parameters is the following : @xmath62 is the effective density of states in the conduction band , @xmath63 is the debye screening length associated to @xmath64 , @xmath65 is the thermal energy , @xmath66 is the thermal velocity , @xmath67 is the thermal voltage , @xmath68 the thermal electric field , @xmath69 the current associated to @xmath62 and @xmath66 , @xmath70 the resistance associated to @xmath71 and @xmath72 the shot noise level associated to @xmath69 .    to complete our analysis , we will perform mc simulations of the system under study , so that the validity of the analytical theory can be checked by comparison . to this end",
    "we use an ensemble mc simulator , 3d in momentum space and self - consistently coupled with a 1d poisson solver to account for coulomb interaction .",
    "the carrier dynamics is simulated in the ballistic active region of the structure and the electron injection from the thermal reservoirs is modeled according to fermi statistics . due to pauli principle",
    ", the instantaneous occupancy of an incoming electron state with energy @xmath73 and impinging at the interface between the ideal thermal reservoir and the active region fluctuates in time obeying a binomial distribution@xcite with a probability of success given by @xmath74 .",

    "it is worth noting that , in all cases where the long range coulomb correlations are absent , as in the present case , the fano factor at low voltages decreases inversely with the applied bias according to the law @xmath188 which corresponds to the thermal noise behavior , while at high voltages ( @xmath145 ) it becomes constant with a value given by @xmath189 which corresponds to current saturation conditions . to obtain eq .",

    "pauli correlations are absent because @xmath200 ( see above ) , while coulomb correlations set in due to relevant space charge effects . due to the small value of the ratio @xmath168",

    "indeed , the fano factor displays the presence of coulomb correlations ( @xmath198 for @xmath199 ) , the absence of pauli correlations in an intermediate bias range ( @xmath203 for @xmath204 ) , and the presence of pauli correlations for higher bias ( @xmath205 for @xmath206 ) .    physically , this behavior is due to the fact that in this region , even if contacts are under degenerate injection conditions ( @xmath177 ) , one has @xmath179 , so that for the lowest applied voltages ( @xmath207 ) it is @xmath208 and the current flows is only due to poissonian carriers at the tail of the fermi distribution function , leading to @xmath203 .",
    "as @xmath22 increases , it is @xmath209 and sub - poissonian carriers near and below the fermi level increasingly contribute to the current and low - frequency noise , so that pauli correlations become manifest in the noise , thus leading to @xmath164 . note that in region ( iv ) one has generally @xmath210 , thus ensuring that the asymptotic theory @xcite provides a good approximation to the exact theory presented here in the range of bias satisfying @xmath211 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "therefore , this is the most interesting region to analyze the interplay between coulomb and pauli correlations .",
    "we note that here the exact theory presented in this paper becomes strictly necessary , since in this region the ratio @xmath168 never takes values much higher than unity ( one typically obtains @xmath214 ) , thus reducing significantly the usefulness of the asymptotic theory,@xcite as illustrated in fig .

    "[ figgl5 ] reports the fano factor as a function of bias for @xmath215 and several values of @xmath30 belonging to region ( v ) .",
    "it is observed that by increasing the value of @xmath30 the contribution of the pauli correlations decreases faster than that of the coulomb correlations .",
    "this is understood by noting that for @xmath194 , @xmath152 varies as @xmath193 , while @xmath150 , being determined by the ratio @xmath216 , varies as @xmath217 .",
    "physically , this behavior reflects the increasing amount of sub - poissonian carriers contributing to the current as @xmath30 becomes higher .",
    "these carriers lead to a more and more pronounced pauli suppression while they do not contribute so much to coulomb suppression , since due to their sub - poissonian character the fluctuations of @xmath34 they induce are much less significant than those originated by the poissonian carriers above the fermi level .",
    "for this reason , @xmath150 tends to saturate for the highest values of @xmath218 while @xmath219 continues decreasing .",
    "remarkably enough , in the region ( v ) for @xmath220 the total fano factor @xmath9 is well described in all cases by a @xmath221 dependence . as seen in the figure , this dependence on voltage is due to the joint action of both pauli and coulomb correlations .",
    "it can also be observed that the onset of coulomb suppression takes place for higher values of @xmath22 as @xmath30 increases , since for this suppresion to become significant it is necessary that the contribution to the current due to carriers injected at the right contact becomes negligible .",
    "this takes place when @xmath222 , condition that requires a higher value of @xmath22 as @xmath30 increases , for a given value of @xmath3 .    to illustrate a realistic example where the theoretical results presented here could be applied",

    "we have presented a semiclassical theory of non - equilibrium noise ( shot - noise ) properties of @xmath0 ballistic semiconductor structures aiming at evaluating the relevance of the long range coulomb interaction and of the pauli exclusion principle .",

    "coulomb correlations are always present because of the small value of the debye screening length . in addition , at low bias only poissonian carriers at the tail of the contact energy distribution contribute to the noise so that pauli correlations are absent , while at higher bias pauli principle becomes active due to the increasing amount of carriers obeying binomial injection statistics that contribute to noise .",
