    "the roles of amplitude degrees of freedom in limit - cycling systems , which represent deviations of the system states from the limit - cycle attractor and are eliminated in the phase - reduction framework , have been extensively studied because they are rich sources of intriguing oscillator dynamics at individual  @xcite and ensemble  @xcite levels . in most studies , however , the analysis is restricted to the vicinity of a supercritical hopf bifurcation , where a simple normal form ( stuart - landau equation ) of the oscillator dynamics is available  @xcite .",
    "some other studies use moving orthonormal frames along the limit cycle to define the amplitudes of the oscillator  @xcite , which allow the quantitative study of the amplitude dynamics of oscillators far from bifurcation points . however , in general , those amplitude variables interact nonlinearly with each other , which hinders simplification of the system description .",
    "thus , it is highly desirable to establish a framework for a quantitative reduced description of limit - cycling systems applicable to transient dynamics far from the limit cycle . such a framework would facilitate in - depth studies of the roles of amplitude degrees of freedom of limit - cycling systems in realistic settings .",
    "the key idea in the phase reduction is assigning the same phase value to the set of initial conditions that share the same asymptotic behavior .",
    "these sets of identical phase values are called _ isochrons _",
    "analogously , in a recent work  @xcite , the notion of _ isostables _ is introduced by identifying the initial conditions that share the same relaxation property , i.e. , the same decay rate toward the attractor .",
    "it has also been shown  @xcite that the isochrons and isostables can be understood from a unified point of view of the spectral properties of the _ koopman _ ( _ composition _ ) _ operator _  @xcite . for each characteristic decay rate of the system state toward the attractor , a set of isostables representing an amplitude degree of freedom can be introduced , which is independent from the phase and the other amplitude degrees of freedom . by retaining a small number of amplitude variables representing",
    "dominant ( slowly - decaying ) part of the transient dynamics , reduced description of the system dynamics can be derived .",
    "the koopman operator has attracted broad interest recently , because it is closely related to a rapidly developing data - driven approach to complex nonlinear systems , called the dynamic mode decomposition  @xcite .",
    "amplitude reduction frameworks for a system near a stable equilibrium based on isostables have been established for multi - dimensional  @xcite and infinite - dimensional systems  @xcite and have been used to formulate optimal control problems of moving the system state toward the equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "recently , wilson and moehlis  @xcite have extended the isostable reduction framework to limit - cycling systems .",
    "however , the isostables introduced in their work have discontinuities on one leaf of the isochrons . to avoid this problem ,",
    "it is assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the system evolves in a close - enough neighborhood of the limit cycle so that the discontinuities are negligible , and the amplitude response to perturbation in their reduced system involves the first order response evaluated only on the limit cycle .",
    "therefore , their analysis is essentially equivalent to deriving a decoupled linear system preserving spectral properties of the original system in a vicinity of the limit - cycle attractor ( called _ kinematically similar _ system in terms of _ lyapunov transformations _",
    "@xcite ) by making use of covariant properties of _ adjoint covariant lyapunov vectors _  @xcite ( also called adjoint floquet vectors  @xcite or dual lyapunov vectors  @xcite ) .",
    "a method to analyze response functions of decoupled phase and amplitude variables in limit - cycling systems , which is based on the _ lie symmetries _ formalism and is valid far from the attractors , has also been proposed  @xcite .",
    "however , the latter analysis is limited to two - dimensional dynamical systems and naive application of the method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , that is , solving _",
    "adjoint equations _ to calculate the response functions , can yield flawed results numerically , as we discuss in this paper . in this study",
    ", we introduce a phase - amplitude reduction framework to describe transient dynamics of stable limit - cycle oscillators , which is applicable to high - dimensional dynamics far from the limit - cycle attractor .",
    "we propose a systematic bi - orthogonalization method to numerically estimate the fundamental quantities for the reduction accurately , i.e. , the first order response functions of the phase and amplitudes to perturbations along a given trajectory , which is not necessarily the limit cycle itself .",
    "these response functions can be interpreted as an extension of the adjoint covariant lyapunov vectors to transient dynamics .",
