    "in the theory of nonlinear waves , many problems appear where several different temporal and/or spatial scales are present .",
    "thus , asymptotic multiscale expansion methods are usually applied to derive nonlinear evolution equations more manageable to the problem at hand @xcite . by means of such asymptotic methods",
    ", it has been demonstrated that several systems integrable by the inverse scattering transform ( ist ) @xcite can be reduced to other integrable models @xcite .",
    "such connections have been proved extremely useful since solutions of the reduced models can be used to construct approximate solutions of the original models . a prominent example is the connection of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation with the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation , which allowed for the description of shallow dark solitons of the former in terms of kdv solitons .",
    "relevant studies started in the early 70s @xcite and continue to this date @xcite ; importantly , they have also been extended to the case of non - integrable systems , providing extremely useful information on the existence , stability and dynamics of solutions in various physical settings , such as nonlinear optics @xcite and bose - einstein condensates @xcite .",
    "indeed , these methods become even more useful when the original system is not integrable without known solutions in explicit form .",
    "models featuring a spatially nonlocal nonlinear response are important examples , since they are used to describe beam dynamics and solitons in various systems such as plasmas @xcite , atomic vapors @xcite , lead glasses featuring strong thermal nonlinearity @xcite , as well as media with a long - range inter - particle interaction .",
    "the latter include nematic liquid crystals with long - range molecular reorientational interactions @xcite , as well as dipolar bosonic quantum gases @xcite .",
    "importantly , nonlocality plays a key role on the soliton properties .",
    "in particular , in the case of focusing nonlocal nonlinearities , collapse does not take place in higher - dimensions @xcite , which results in stable solitons , as observed in experiments of , say @xcite , even in the @xmath0-dimensional setting @xcite  see , e.g. , reviews @xcite and references therein . on the other hand , in the case of defocusing nonlocal nonlinearities , dark solitons that are supported in such settings",
    "@xcite , may exhibit an attractive interaction @xcite , rather than a repulsive one , as is the situation in the case of a local nonlinearity  cf . @xcite and references therein .",
    "furthermore , dark solitons which are known to be prone to the transverse ( or `` snaking '' ) instability in higher - dimensional settings @xcite , can be stabilized due to the nonlocal nonlinearity @xcite .    motivated by the above , and particularly by the fact that nonlocal nonlinearities have a profound effect on the form and stability properties of nonlinear excitations , in this work , we study a nonlocal defocusing nls model in @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "a brief description of our findings , as well as the outline of the presentation , is as follows .",
    "first , in section  2 , we present the model which is considered in both physically relevant geometries : cartesian and cylindrical . the model describes light beam propagation in nematic liquid crystals @xcite and thermal nonlinear media @xcite , and has been used to predict three - dimensional ( 3d ) solitons @xcite .",
    "in addition , the continuous - wave ( cw ) solution is found and its stability is analysed",
    ". then , in section  3 , we use multiscale expansion methods to derive asymptotic reductions of the nonlocal nls equation . at an intermediate stage of the asymptotic analysis",
    ", we obtain a boussinesq - type equation .",
    "next , we consider the far - field of the boussinesq equation , and derive various kadomtsev - petviashvilli ( kp ) type models for right- and left - going waves . these models , which are classified in section  4 , include kp - i and kp - ii equations , in cartesian and cylindrical geometry ( in the latter , the relevant model is also known as the johnson equation @xcite ) , as well as the cylindrical - i ( ci ) and cylindrical - ii ( cii ) equations .",
    "all these models have been used to describe various physical situations ranging from shallow - water waves to ion - acoustic waves in plasmas , and so on @xcite . in the same section ( sec .  4 ) , we present solitary waves of the original nonlocal model , which are constructed from solutions of the effective asymptotic equations .",
    "we thus find kdv - type , spatial dark or anti - dark solitary waves , namely intensity dips or humps on top of the cw - background , which may exhibit either a planar shape ( stripes ) or a cylindrical ( ring ) shape .",
    "dark ( anti - dark ) solitary waves exist in a weak ( strong ) nonlocal regime , defined by the sign of a characteristic quantity that links all the physical parameters of the original nonlocal system , and are unstable ( stable ) in the 2d setting .",
    "we also find temporal dark solitary waves which are predicted to be unstable in higher - dimensions .",
    "our analytical predictions are found to be in very good agreement with results from direct numerical simulations : indeed , using the analytical forms of the spatial soliton solutions as initial conditions for the direct numerical integration of the original problem , we find that the solitons propagate undistorted  at least for relatively small propagation distances .",
    "note that , even for longer propagation distances , instabilities are not observed in our simulations , which suggests that the solitons found have a good chance to be observed in experiments .",
    "finally , in section  5 , we present our conclusions and highlight some interesting directions for future studies .",
    "we consider a @xmath0-dimensional nonlocal nls model , composed by a system of two coupled equations for the complex field amplitude @xmath1 and the nonlinear correction to the refractive index @xmath2 ( which is a real function ) .",
    "this model applies , in particular , to light propagation in nematic liquid crystals @xcite and to thermal nonlinear optical media @xcite ( see also relevant theoretical and experimental work in  @xcite ) .",
    "the system under consideration is expressed in the following dimensionless form @xcite : @xmath3 where subscripts denote partial derivatives , @xmath4 is the propagation coordinate ( normalized to the diffraction length ) , @xmath5 is retarded time , and @xmath6 is the transverse laplacian .",
    "below , we consider both physically relevant geometries , cartesian and cylindrical , for which the laplacian respectively reads : @xmath7 with transverse coordinates @xmath8 or @xmath9 , respectively , normalized with respect to the beam width .",
    "additionally , the real constants @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 in eqs .  ( [ nls1])-([nls2 ] ) , which are assumed to be @xmath13 parameters in our analysis below , have the following physical significance .",
    "first , @xmath10 represents the ratio of diffraction and dispersion lengths , with @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) corresponding to anomalous ( normal ) group - velocity dispersion ( gvd ) .",
    "second , in the context of nematic liquid crystals , the parameter @xmath12 is related to the square of the applied static electric field that pre - tilts the nematic dielectric @xcite .",
    "third , parameter @xmath11 measures the relative width of the response of the medium to the light field , and is connected to the nonlocality scale of the nonlinear response of the medium : in the limit @xmath16 , the system of eqs .",
    "( [ nls1])-([nls2 ] ) decouples and is reduced to a local @xmath0-dimensional nls equation with a cubic defocusing nonlinearity .    to start our analysis",

    "it is readily observed that the above system possesses an exact steady - state solution of the form : @xmath24 which corresponds to the continuous - wave ( cw ) solution @xmath25 of eqs .",
    "( [ nls1])-([nls2 ] ) .",
    "note that the constant amplitude @xmath18 can be absorbed into @xmath19 in the madelung transformation ; nevertheless , for convenience , we opt to use @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ mand ] ) so that no extra free phase appears on the solutions that we present below , thus making presentation more clear .",
    "to further elaborate on this point , and also to underline the importance of this cw solution in our analysis ( because the cw defines the background on top of which our solutions will propagate ) , let us write the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ nls1])-([nls2 ] ) as @xmath26 where the background ( cw ) solution satisfies @xmath27 obviously , the solution of the above equations is given in eq .",
    "( [ background ] ) , while @xmath28 and @xmath29 satisfy the system @xmath30 this system possesses a cw solution of unit amplitude , as would be the case if @xmath18 was not used in the madelung transformation ( i.e. , in other words , @xmath18 will inevitably appear in the cw background solution ) .",
    "below we seek nonlinear excitations ( e.g. , solitary waves ) which propagate on top of this cw background .",
    "it is , thus , relevant to investigate if this solution is subject to modulational instability ( mi ) : evidently , nonlinear excitations corresponding to an unstable background do not have any physical purport .",
    "the stability of the cw solution can be investigated upon employing eqs .",

    ", we should recall that the evolution variable in our problem is the propagation distance @xmath4 and , thus , the mi analysis is performed with respect to this variable ; as such , @xmath36 and its roots ( real or imaginary ) will determine the stability of the cw solution . to this end , substituting the above ansatz into eqs .",
    "( [ h1])-([h3 ] ) , we find that small - amplitude linear waves obey a dispersion relation of the following form , @xmath37 the results stemming from the above equation are as follows .",
    "first , eq .",
    "( [ dr ] ) shows that the cw solution is always modulationally stable , i.e. , @xmath38  @xmath39 , provided @xmath15 .",
    "note , that in the @xmath40-dimensional case ( corresponding to @xmath41 and @xmath42 , or @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , this result recovers the one of ref .",
    "second , if @xmath45 , the cw solution is unstable : in this case , perturbations grow exponentially , with the instability growth rate given by @xmath46 . thus , hereafter , we focus on this case , and assume that @xmath47 , corresponding to the anomalous gvd regime . it is , therefore , clear that the asymptotic analysis and results that we present in the following sections are only valid in this regime ; in the opposite case , of @xmath45 , since the cw background is unstable , any small perturbations on top of it will result in collapsing solutions .    another physically relevant information stemming from eq .",
    "( [ dr ] ) is that , in the long - wavelength and low - frequency limit ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) , small - amplitude spatial or temporal waves propagate on top of the cw background with `` sound velocities '' @xmath49 or @xmath50 , respectively , which are given by : @xmath51 these characteristic velocities can also be determined , in a self - consistent manner , in the framework of the reductive perturbation method ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it is also noted that in the unstable case of @xmath45 , velocity @xmath52 becomes imaginary , a fact that also indicates that perturbations of the cw solution grow exponentially in the propagation distance @xmath4 .",
    "observing that the dispersion relation ( [ dr ] ) resembles the one of a boussinesq equation @xcite , we now derive from eqs .",
    "( [ h1])-([h3 ] ) a boussinesq equation , for either cartesian or cylindrical geometry .",

( [ bou ] ) is a linear wave equation indicating that the velocities of spatial or temporal waves are indeed those given in eq .",
    "( [ cs ] ) .",
    "in addition , at order @xmath69 , eq .  ( [ bou ] ) incorporates fourth - order dispersion terms and quadratic nonlinear terms .",
    "obviously , eq .",
    "( [ bou ] ) is a boussinesq - type equation , either in cartesian or cylindrical coordinates , as per the discussion above .",
    "the boussinesq equation has been originally proposed for studies of waves in shallow water @xcite , but later it was also used in different contexts , ranging from ion - acoustic waves in plasmas @xcite to mechanical lattices and electrical transmission lines @xcite .",

( [ bou ] ) , was derived from a @xmath80-dimensional nls equation , in cartesian coordinates , with a local defocusing nonlinearity @xcite ; earlier analysis of this boussinesq model @xcite was used in @xcite to investigate self - focusing and transverse instability of plane dark solitons ( see also @xcite for a review and references therein ) .",
    "in fact , the cartesian version of the boussinesq model  ( [ bou ] ) is reduced to the one derived in @xcite in the limit of @xmath16 , i.e. , in the local nonlinearity case .",
    "we now proceed to derive the far - field equations stemming from the boussinesq model ( [ bou ] ) , in the framework of multiscale asymptotic expansions . as is known , the far - field of the boussinesq equation in @xmath40-dimensions is a pair of two kdv equations @xcite , while in @xmath80-dimensions , it is a pair of kp equations @xcite , for right- and left - going waves .",
    "below we show that eq .",
    "( [ bou ] ) gives rise to @xmath0-dimensional kp - type models for such waves .",

    "in conclusion , using multiscale expansion methods , we derived asymptotic reductions of @xmath0-dimensional nonlocal nls equations , that are used to describe nonlinear waves in nematic liquid crystals and media with a thermal nonlinearity . working on the hydrodynamic form of the model , both in cartesian and cylindrical geometries , first we derived , at an intermediate stage of the asymptotic analysis , a 3d boussinesq equation .",
    "then , we considered two cases , corresponding to spatial or temporal structures and , upon introducing relevant scales and asymptotic expansions , we reduced the boussinesq model to kp - type equations that govern right- and left - propagating waves .",

    "we also employed these models to construct approximate solitary wave solutions of the original nonlocal nls model .",
    "note that a complete discussion of the various solutions and their properties will be provided in a later communication .",
    "as such , useful results were deduced on the type and the stability of lower - dimensional solitary waves in higher - dimensional settings . in that regard , we identified parameter regimes , corresponding to relatively weak or strong nonlocality , for which we predicted the existence and stability of various solitary waves .",
    "thus , we predicted the existence of spatial , planar or cylindrical ( ring - shaped ) , dark or anti - dark solitary waves , for weak or strong nonlocality , respectively , and that dark ( anti - dark ) solitary waves are unstable ( stable ) in the @xmath80-dimensional setting .",
    "furthermore , our analysis suggested the existence of temporal solitary waves , which become unstable in higher dimensions .",
    "regarding approximate two - dimensional solitary wave solutions , it was found that they may exist in the form of algebraically decaying dark `` lumps '' , which satisfy effective kp - i models ; such structures may be either of the spatial or temporal type and are supported in the weak nonlocality regime .",
    "our analytical predictions were also corroborated by results of direct numerical simulations .",
    "indeed , we have used the analytical forms of the spatial soliton profiles , in both the cartesian and the cylindrical geometry , we have studied their evolution stemming from the direct numerical integration of the original nonlocal model .",
    "we have thus found that both the dark and anti - dark soliton stripes and rings propagate undistorted , as per the effective kp picture , at least for short propagation distances .",
