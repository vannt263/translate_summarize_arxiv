    "the goldstone  theorem asserts that    in a theory with spontaneous breaking of a global symmetry group some massless scalar bosons should exist - the so - called nambu - goldstone bosons ( ng ) - one per global symmetry broken by the vacuum .",
    "good candidates for spontaneously broken quantum numbers are the partial lepton numbers @xmath3 and total lepton number @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , they are conserved by the standard model ( sm ) interactions , but several experiments going now from solar to atmospheric neutrinos and laboratory oscillation experiments @xcite indicate that the lepton flavors are not conserved .",
    "the ng bosons not only have zero mass but also no scalar potential terms such as @xmath5 .",
    "futhermore , they also interact with the fermion particles however , they do not mediate long range forces .",
    "the reason lies in the very global symmetry that , broken by the vacuum still operates at the lagrangian level .",
    "a ng boson transforms as @xmath6 @xmath7 , and therefore the symmetry requires that these fields have nothing but derivative couplings ( this is related to the soft pion low energy theorems @xcite ) _ i.e. _ , all of the ng boson interactions can be expressed with an effective lagrangian of the form @xmath8 the @xmath9 equation of motion is nothing but the conservation law of the total current associated with the @xmath10 symmetry , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is essentially the scale of symmetry breaking and the current @xmath13 is determined in leading order by the quantum numbers of the particles . for instance , if @xmath14 is the electron lepton number @xmath15 , @xmath16 where the dots stand for model dependent radiative corrections and scalar boson contributions .",

    "what are the possible consequences ?",

    "next i show two examples .",
    "one @xcite is the improvement of adiabaticity of otherwise @xmath82 non - adiabatic transitions . the other @xcite is the violation of the sm prediction that the anti - neutrinos do not resonantly oscillate if the neutrino masses obey the hierarchy of the charged lepton masses .",
    "suppose that in the sun the electron - neutrino oscillates into the muon - neutrino with the parameters of the non - adiabatic , small mixing angle solution @xcite .",
    "then , the @xmath83 transitions are also non - adiabatic in a supernova and only a fraction of each neutrino species is converted into the other . furthermore ,",
    "since the level crossing probability is an increasing function of the energy , the hotter @xmath42s  have larger survival probabilities than the cooler @xmath1s .",
    "let us assume that the partial lepton number @xmath15 is conserved at the lagrangian level but the respective global symmetry , u(1)@xmath84 , is spontaneously broken .",
    "then , a ng boson ( majoron ) , @xmath44 , exists with zero mass .",
    "although in principle , the neutrino mass matrix violates all three lepton numbers , i will ignore for simplicity other possibly existing majorons .",
    "notice that other ng fields are naturally less intense if the respective scales of symmetry breaking are slightly higher .",

    "@xmath97  one needs to know the fluxes of @xmath42 and @xmath1  as functions of the radius and their energy spectra .",

    "is maintained : the signature of ng fields is a _ surprise _ _ i.e. _ , an oscillation pattern not consistent with sm weak interactions @xcite .",
    "an important point is that the nambu - goldstone fields are proportional to the reaction rates that violate the relevant quantum numbers . in the case of neutrino oscillations",
    "this manifests as a dependence on the neutrino luminosity magnitudes .",
    "the effects of the majoron fields if any , will be observed in a shorter or longer interval of time depending on the actual scale of lepton number symmetry breaking .",

    "in the framework of the sm weak interactions the anti - neutrinos can not undergo a resonant oscillation if the neutrino masses follow the same hierarchy as the charged leptons .",
    "that is because the sm potential @xmath77 is positive in an electron rich star medium and the potential reverses sign for antineutrinos .",
    "the ng boson contributions are not only non - universal in flavour but also their signs depend on the flavour content of the neutrinofluxes and dominant flavor transitions .",
