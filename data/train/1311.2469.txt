    "the ultimate goal of the bocce project is to get insight on the formation and evolution of the galactic disc , and ocs are among the best tracers of the disc properties ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we have already analysed photometric data for 31 ocs ( see @xcite , and references therein ) , and derived their age , distance and reddening from the comparison of their colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) with synthetic ones based on three sets of stellar evolution models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we discuss ngc  1817 ( galactic coordinates @xmath4 ) , ngc  2141 ( @xmath5 ) , and berkeley 81 ( be  81 , @xmath6 ) .",
    "these clusters have been selected because they could be targets of the gaia - eso survey ( ges , see @xcite for a description ) .",
    "the ges is an on - going public spectroscopic survey with flames@vlt , that will obtain high - resolution giraffe and uves spectra of about 10@xmath7 stars of all milky way components , including stars in about 100 ocs and associations .",
    "for all the ges cluster targets we need photometry and precise astrometry covering all the flames field of view ( diameter of 25 ) to properly point the fibres .",
    "such adequate photometry was not yet available for ngc  2141 , be  81 , and ngc  1817 , and we acquired it on purpose with lbt .",
    "ngc  2141 and ngc  1817 are anti - centre clusters , whilst be  81 lies towards the galactic centre kpc for ngc  1817 , @xmath8 kpc for ngc  2141 , and @xmath9 kpc for be  81 .",

    "ngc  1817 - _ its richness , distance from the galactic plane ( -400 pc ) , and metallicity make this cluster particularly interesting .",
    "in fact , ngc  1817 has been the target of many photometric studies , starting from @xcite and @xcite , who obtained shallow photographic cmds , including only stars at the main sequence turn - off ( msto ) and some giants .",

    "a subsolar metallicity was derived by @xcite on the basis of washington photometry .",
    "spectroscopic analyses were made using low resolution spectra by @xcite and high resolution ones by @xcite and @xcite for different cluster stars . despite showing different results",

    "her cmd reached about four magnitudes below the msto , and showed a large scatter , interpreted in terms of both field star contamination and differential reddening .",
    "@xcite determined the reddening , distance modulus , metallicity and age listed in table  [ tablit ] from a fit with the @xcite isochrones .",

    "they estimated the metallicity from the ir photometry , deriving best - fit age and distance , based on the @xcite isochrones ( see table  [ tablit ] ) .",
    "spectroscopic analyses of cluster stars was made by different authors : @xcite , @xcite used low resolution spectra while @xcite and @xcite high resolution ones .",
    "they found different values for the cluster metallicity from solar to sub - solar ( see table  [ tablit ] ) .",

    "berkeley  81 - _ @xmath19 photometry of part of be  81 has been presented by @xcite .",
    "they argued for the absence of significant differential reddening from the cmds of different regions , and attributed the width of the ms to the presence of field stars , binaries , and variables .",
    "they derived a cluster radius of @xmath20 arcmin , and the reddening , distance modulus and age listed in table  [ tablit ] , using the @xcite isochrones with solar metallicity .",
    "the metallicity of be  81 was determined from calcium triplet ( cat ) spectroscopy by @xcite .",
    "their subsolar value is however quite uncertain , since they were unable to convincingly define the cluster mean rv , due to the huge contamination by field stars .",
    "the ges spectra will thus be crucial to infer its actual metallicity .",

    "the number of stars in each subsector is counted and the density is obtained by dividing this value by the sector area . the stellar density in each annulus is then obtained as the average of the subsector densities , and the uncertainty is estimated from the variance among the subsectors .",
    "also in this case , only stars within a limited range of magnitudes are considered in order to avoid spurious effects due to photometric incompleteness .",

    "for these two ocs the collected data - set covers the entire cluster extension , reaching the outermost region where the galactic field stars represent the dominant contribution with respect to the cluster .",
    "this is not the case for ngc  1817 , which is not fully covered by the lbt s fov . as done for the centre determination , we tried to evaluate its density profile on a larger area using 2mass , sdss , and literature catalogues , but the looseness of the cluster and its proximity to a nearby oc ( ngc  1807 , even if @xcite showed that ngc  1807 is not a physical cluster ) jeopardise the analysis .",
    "unable to reach a satisfying conclusion , we preferred to limit the analysis to be  81 and ngc  2141 .",

    "the residual of the fit of the model to each observed point is shown in the lower panel of each density plot .",
    "clearly , be  81 is a small , low - mass and very sparse oc .",
    "the density profile is hence affected by larger statistical uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless , the residuals of the model fit are quite small , at least in the most central part , where the star counts are dominated by the cluster s members .",
    "as noted in sec . [ sec : cmd ] , ngc  2141 shows a `` golf club '' shaped msto . we can exclude that this observed feature is due to the photometric error , which is too small to explain the colour extension . @xcite",
    "propose a metallicity spread as best explanation , but this circumstance is very unlikely in ocs . in literature",
    "there are other similar examples of milky way ocs and magellanic clouds clusters showing an extended msto ( see e.g. tr  20 in the mw , @xcite , and about 10 young globular clusters in the lmc , @xcite ) .",
    "another possible explanation is stellar rotation .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that fast rotators at the to phase have a redder and fainter colour , and can be responsible for the `` golf club '' shape .",
    "@xcite , instead , exclude that rotation can have such an effect . also binary systems , which have redder colour and brighter magnitude than single stars , could explain the broadening of the ms , as could an age spread .",
    "the latter , however has never been convincingly observed in ocs .",
    "a more plausible explanation can be differential reddening ( dr ) .",
    "different absorptions on the cluster field due to different extinction paths along the line of sight results in different shifts in colour and magnitude .",
    "this circumstance can also explain the elongated shape of the rc , when rc stars are spread along one single direction .",
    "most likely , dr is not negligible also over the field of be  81 , that is located very close to the galactic plane ( about 130 pc below the disc , see sec .",
    "[ sec : cmdsynth ] ) and toward the galactic centre .",
    "its high average reddening , @xmath28 mag , favours the chances for dr .",
    "however , be  81 is severely contaminated by field stars , and this makes it very hard to measure dr . for ngc  1817 there is no direct evidence of dr from the observational cmd ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cmderrbv ] ) .    to evaluate the effect of dr for ngc  2141 we adopt the following approach , using a revision of the method described in @xcite , adapted to the case of the ocs , which are less populated and more contaminated by field stars than the globular clusters .",
    "the main steps of the process are the following :    * we draw a fiducial line along the ms , and use it as a reference locus for the dr estimate ; * we draw a box on the ms : all stars falling in this box are used to estimate the dr .",
    "the box is chosen to select stars on the blue side of the ms , and to avoid as many binaries as possible , since they also produce a shift to the red of the sequence .",
    "we also keep far from the msto and the fainter part of the ms , where errors are larger and field stars confuse the picture ; * for each star in the catalogue we pick the 30 nearest and brightest stars inside the ms box and compute their median distance along the reddening vector direction from the fiducial line in the cmd plane .",
    "this distance is used to correct colour and magnitude for dr ; * after the correction for the first dr estimate is applied star - by - star , the algorithm starts a new loop and this procedure is repeated until a convergence is reached . the convergence criterion is a user - defined percentage of stars for which the dr correction is lower than the average rms on these estimates ; * once a final value for the dr is obtained for each star , a binning is performed in the spatial plane . the spatial scale must be compatible with the average distance of the 30 neighbour stars selected and used for the dr estimate . in our case",
    "it is less than 1 arcmin@xmath13 , as described in the following paragraphs . at this point",
    "the outliers are rejected , i.e. , stars whose dr estimate is larger than the average error , and stars whose distance to the 30 neighbours is larger than average . * a final and robust value for the dr is then computed as the average value of the dr corrections associated to the stars falling in the same bin and the error on this estimate is the associated rms .",
    "the values obtained are not absolute values but relative to the fiducial line .",
    "we estimated the dr in the @xmath29 colour .",
    "the direction of the reddening vector is derived assuming the standard extinction law ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) described in @xcite .",
    "the fiducial line is defined using the cmd of the inner part of the cluster ( all the stars inside 4@xmath23 ) and is chosen as the ridge line along the ms .",
    "several attempts have been made to avoid fiducial lines that , during the estimates of the dr , lead to corrections that artificially and significantly change the magnitude and colour of the age - sensitive indicators ( e.g. rc , msto ) .",
    "we want in fact to keep rc , msto and the blue envelope of the ms as close as possible to the original position in the cmd , to avoid spurious interpretations of the cluster parameters due to dr corrections . when defining the ms box we avoided the broad and bended region of the to , where the morphology could hamper the correct interpretation , and the fainter part of the ms , where the photometric error is more important .",
    "the box and the fiducial line used are highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd_box ] with colours .",
    "cmd of ngc  2141 inside 4 arcmin . the red box and the blue line indicate the ms box and the fiducial line for the dr estimate .",
    "the red arrow indicates the reddening vector . ]",
    "taking into account the star counts of the inner and outer parts of the cluster ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : centre ] ) we decided to limit the dr correction to stars within a 4@xmath23 radius ( approximately the half mass radius ) .",
    "for the outer regions the contamination of field stars becomes not negligible ( the contrast density counts with respect to the field plateau drops below 50% ) and any attempt to estimate the dr is severely affected by field interlopers .",
    "the spatial smoothing applied to have a more robust statistic is @xmath32 in right ascension and declination . as final caveat",
    ", we stress that photometric errors , undetected binary systems , and residual contamination from the field could affect the dr estimation , since they all produce a broadening of the ms .",
    "our results are then an upper limit to the dr .    in fig .",

    "it ranges from @xmath34 to @xmath35 . in the same figure",
    "we show the corresponding map of the error associated to our estimates .",

    "the ms and msto region appear tighter , reducing substantially the broadening . in the figure ,",
    "only the upper ms stars corrected for dr are highlighted in black , but the lower ms benefits from the dr correction too .",
    "the rc stars , apparently aligned along the direction of the reddening vector in the original cmd ( see the left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : drn2141 ] ) , appear more clumped after the dr correction , thus supporting the dr hypothesis .",
    "also the rgb looks better defined .",
    "furthermore , our dr estimate does not change the luminosity level and colour of age sensitive indicators such as the msto , or the bright edge of the ms , the red - hook phase .",
    "we list in our catalogue for ngc  2141 both the original magnitudes and the dr corrected ones .",
    "we can not apply the same analysis to be  81 because it is severely contaminated by field interlopers even in the inner regions .",
    "for instance , in the central 2@xmath23 ( approximately the half - mass radius estimated in sec . [ sec : centre ] ) , the density contrast is only 25% .",
    "hence , in its case the algorithm would be driven by stars not belonging to the cluster rather than ms stars , seriously weakening the results .",
    "we thus prefer to evaluate the effect of dr on be  81 with the synthetic cmd technique described in the next section .",
    "age , metallicity , distance , mean galactic reddening , and binary fraction have been estimated with the same procedure adopted for other works of this series ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we compare the observational cmds with a library of synthetic ones , built using synthetic stellar populations ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "different sets of evolutionary tracks have been used to monte carlo generate the synthetic cmds .",
    "the best fit solution is chosen as the one that can best reproduce some age - sensitive indicators as the luminosity level of the ms reddest point ( `` red hook '' , rh ) , the rc and the main sequence termination point ( mstp , evaluated as the maximum luminosity reached after the overall contraction , ovc , and before the runaway to the red ) , the luminosity at the base of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , the rgb inclination and colour , and the rc colour . the most valuable age indicators are the turn off ( to ) point , that is the bluest point after the ovc , and the rc luminosity ; however , at least in the case of ocs , these phases may be very poorly populated , and identifying them is not a trivial game , especially if a strong field stars contamination is present ( as in the case of be  81 ) .",
    "the binary fraction is estimated adopting the method described in @xcite .",
    "the dr is taken into account and the synthetic cmd technique applied to the dr corrected photometry .",
    "the best fit to all the above indicators provides the best choice for age , reddening , and distance modulus . to infer the metallicity it is crucial to analyse together all the @xmath19 photometry ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the best metallicity is the one that allows to reproduce at the same time both the observed @xmath29 and @xmath36 cmd . to deal with @xmath37 and @xmath38 colours we adopted the normal extinction law @xcite .",
    "we estimated the errors on the cluster parameters considering both the instrumental photometric errors and the uncertainties of the fit analysis , as done in @xcite .",
    "the net effect of the former is an uncertainty on the luminosity level and colour of the adopted indicators .",
    "this affects mainly the estimate of the mean galactic reddening and distance modulus , as they are directly defined by matching the level and colour of the upper ms and the rh and mstp indicators .",
    "we must also consider the dispersion in the results arising from the fit analysis .",
    "open clusters offer poor statistics , and important indicators , such as the rc locus , are poorly defined .",
    "hence , we can not find a unique solution , but only a restricted range of viable solutions .",
    "in practice , we select the best fitting synthetic cmd and then take into account the dispersion of the cluster parameters estimates in the error budget .",
    "the uncertainties are assumed to be of the form : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 typical photometric errors are @xmath42 on the reddening and @xmath43 on the distance modulus ( assuming negligible the error on @xmath44 ) .",
    "the error resulting from the fit analysis depends mainly on the uncertainty on the rc level and on the coarseness of the isochrone grid .",
    "it is of the order of @xmath45 for the reddening , and ranges between 0.01 and 0.05 for the distance modulus , and about 0.2 - 1 gyr for the age .      with the deep lbt photometry we can reach magnitude @xmath46 in the @xmath29 cmd , describing very well the ms .",

    "there is a clear signature of rc stars , confirmed by the studies on the rv of spectroscopic targets ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : rv ] and fig .",

[",
    "fig : n1817cmd ] ) . to remove the field contamination we subtracted the contribution of field stars falling inside the same cmd boxes in a portion of the control field with same area .",
    "we performed the same computation on regions smaller and larger than 5@xmath23 , finally ending with an estimate between 20% and 30% .",
    "the dispersion on the estimate is mostly due to the spatial fluctuations across the control field .",
    "for example in the inner area around the cluster centre a higher fraction of binaries is found .",
    "notice that the derived binary fractions may be underestimated , since we possibly miss systems with very low mass secondary , whose luminosity does nt alter significantly that of the primary .",
    "a mean fraction of 25% has been assumed for all the simulations presented here .",
    "we limit the differential reddening to 0.02 mag because we find no direct evidence of it in this cluster .    after fixing",

    "looking at the luminosity functions of the observational and synthetic cmds ( see fig . [",
    "fig : n2141lfs ] ) we clearly see that the peak of the synthetic distribution is fainter than the observational one . in the comparison field ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : n2141cmd ] ) there are clearly ms stars around @xmath63 .",
    "this may be due to evaporation .",
    "i.e. , the typical tendency of low mass stars of moving out of the cluster .",
    "another possible explanation is related to the initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the best models predicts a mass of about 0.8 @xmath78 at @xmath63 , in the mass range where salpeter s imf @xcite overestimates the mass fraction .",
    "since the synthetic cmds are generated assuming salpeter s imf , they are likely to overpredict low mass stars .     but for ngc  2141 .",

    "comparing with literature results we find a lower age with respect to both @xcite and @xcite . in both cases",
    "the authors chose a to fainter than ours by about 0.5 mag ( at about the same level of our rh ) , and a rc slightly brighter than ours ( see fig . 5 in @xcite ) . since the age is primarily constrained by the magnitude difference between the rc and the msto , the large difference in age",
    "is explained by the choice of these two age indicators .",
    "we confirm a sub - solar metallicity as suggested by the two papers .",
    "be  81 is highly contaminated by field interlopers , condition that makes the interpretation of the cluster features more difficult . for a more robust analysis we studied the inner part of the cluster , where the contrast density with respect to the background density ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : centre ] ) is higher and the cluster members should be more evident . from fig .",

    "no rc stars appear in the external part of the field . ]",
    "the binary sequence for this cluster is not evident at all from the cmds because of the high contamination and possibly dr , and for the simulations we adopted a conservative value of 25% as found on average in many ocs .",
    "we expect a not negligible dr .",
    "the ms appears more extended in colour than expected from the photometric error and the probable rc stars have scattered colour and magnitude .",
    "after several tests , we decided to adopt a dr of 0.15 for the simulations , with a sensitivity of 0.03 .",
    "lower or higher values imply a too tight or too extended ms in the synthetic cmds .",
    "we find that the cluster footprints ( ms and rc ) can be reproduced by a solar metallicity , for which we obtain a good match in both @xmath50 and @xmath51 cmds .",
    "with all the models we can reproduce the magnitude of the age sensitive indicators ( rh and rc ) and the overall shape of the observational cmd ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : be81synth ] ) .",
    "the colour of the rc is well recovered by fst and franec models .",
    "because of the high contamination from field stars and the effect of severe dr we can not detail our analysis further .    with the padova models we find an age of 0.9 gyr , an average reddening @xmath82 , and a distance modulus @xmath83 . in the case of fst models",
    "the best match is for an age of 1.0 gyr , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 .",

    "the comparison of the observational and synthetic lfs is very good both in magnitude and in colour , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : be81lfs ] .    we find a good agreement with the results presented by @xcite .",
    "we estimate a lower average differential reddening ( about 0.1 mag lower ) but this can be explained by the differences in our photometries ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : calib ] ) . on the other hand they exclude that",
    "dr be the explanation of the observed broad ms , pointing out that the severe contamination of field stars pollutes the cluster sequences and drives the cmd appearance .",
    "we investigated further this hypothesis using the synthetic cmd technique and choosing different external areas inside our fov .",
    "we find that the lower ms ( @xmath77 ) is always dominated by field contamination and the signature of the cluster is not evident .",
    "hence we evaluated the dr effect from the brighter part of the ms .",
    "it is true that there are many field interlopers even for @xmath88 , but low drs always imply a too tight synthetic ms and rc with respect to the observations .",
    "hence we suggest that dr is not negligible across the fov of be  81 .",
    "firmer conclusions , especially on the cluster metallicity , will be obtained from the analysis of the ges spectra . both radial velocity measurements and chemical abundance estimates",
    "will be fundamental to distinguish cluster members from field stars , cleaning the cluster sequences by interlopers .",
    "the synthetic cmd technique can also be used to evaluate the total mass of the clusters summing the masses of all the synthetically generated stars still alive . in order to do that",
    "properly we normalised the synthetic population to the star counts inside one @xmath26 and with magnitude @xmath89 for which 100% completeness is achieved .",
    "the contamination of field stars is taken into account for the normalisation .",
    "the derived mass inside one @xmath26 is then multiplied by two to have an estimate of the total mass .",
    "the results quoted in tab . [ tab : summary ] are obtained with montecarlo experiments .",
    "we generated 300 hundred synthetics for each cluster taking into account the uncertainty on the normalisation star counts and the error on the distance modulus and differential reddening parameters .",
    "the first one is considered as a poissonian error on the counts , hence it affects the number of stars extracted to populate the synthetic . the errors on the distance modulus and reddening ( quoted in sec .",
    "[ sec : cmdsynth ] ) affect the mass limit at which the synthetic population is normalised .",
    "we use the median of the distribution obtained and its rms . as the reference estimate for the total mass of the cluster .",
    "we can perform this evaluation only for ngc  2141 and be  81 , the two clusters for which we could estimate the king profile ( see sec . [",
    "sec : centre ] ) . for ngc  2141",
    "we adopted @xmath90 as magnitude limit to normalise the synthetic population .",
    "this limit corresponds to the faintest magnitude at which completeness is still 100% ( see tab .",
    "[ tab : compl ] ) . for",
    "be  81 we adopted @xmath91 as magnitude limit . using brighter magnitude limits comparable mass estimates are found within the errors .",
    "these computations provide about @xmath92 for be  81 and @xmath93 for ngc  2141 .",
    "these mass estimates are a lower limit to the total cluster mass .",
    "in fact the stellar models we are using to make synthetic populations have a lower mass limit of 0.6 @xmath78 , hence all the stars with lower mass are not taken into account . to get the actual cluster mass we then need to extrapolate along the imf down to 0.1 @xmath78 .",
    "this implies multiplying by a factor of two the mass if we adopt salpeter s imf ( salpeter 1955 ) and by a factor of 1.4 if we adopt kroupa s ( 2002 ) .",
    "since the latter is supposed to best describe the real imf , we conclude that be  81 has a mass of @xmath94 and ngc  2141 of @xmath95 .",
