    "now we join 12 vertices other than previous @xmath433 vertices into @xmath105 groups indicating the remaining @xmath105 vertices @xmath436 and @xmath437 .",
    "thus each @xmath438 , @xmath439 , consists of three vertices among @xmath440 . since the distance between any @xmath441 and @xmath442 can not exceed @xmath60 , the following two properties must be satisfied .",
    "first property is that @xmath438 contains exactly one vertex from each group @xmath443 for @xmath163 .",
    "for example , if @xmath444 ( i.e. two vertices from the group @xmath445 ) , then we can connect @xmath300 to at most two vertices among @xmath446 through some @xmath447 .",
    "this means that the distance between @xmath300 and one among @xmath446 exceed @xmath60 .",
    "second is that different @xmath438 and @xmath448 share at most one vertex .",
    "for example , if they share two vertices @xmath300 and @xmath301 , then @xmath449 .",
    "from these two properties , without loss of generality , we may say that @xmath450 , @xmath451 , @xmath452 , and @xmath453 as drawn in figure  [ fig:10](b ) .",
