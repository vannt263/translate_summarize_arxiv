    "in the current research of nuclear physics and astrophysics , there is of great interest to study the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath0 that essentially characterizes the isospin dependent part of the equation of state ( eos ) of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the exact knowledge on the symmetry energy is important for understanding not only many problems in nuclear physics , but also many critical topics in astrophysics  @xcite as well as some interesting issues regarding possible new physics beyond the standard model @xcite . during the last decade , although significant progress has been made both experimentally and theoretically on constraining the density dependence of the symmetry energy  @xcite ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for review of recent progress ) , large uncertainties on @xmath0 still exist , especially its super - normal density behavior remains elusive and largely controversial  @xcite .",
    "to reduce the uncertainties of the constraints on @xmath0 is thus of critical importance and remains a big challenge in the community , and this provides a strong motivation for studying isospin nuclear physics in radioactive nuclei at the new / planning rare isotope beam facilities around the world , such as csr / lanzhou and brif - ii / beijing in china , ribf / riken in japan , spiral2/ganil in france , fair / gsi in germany , frib / nscl in usa , spes / lnl in italy , and koria in korea .",
    "theoretically , the uncertainties of the constraints on @xmath6 are mainly due to the lack of knowledge about the isospin dependence of in - medium nuclear effective interactions and the limitations in the techniques for solving the nuclear many body problem .",
    "very recently , it has been proposed that it is very useful to directly decompose @xmath0 in terms of some relevant parts of the commonly used underlying nuclear effective interaction in nuclear medium  @xcite .",
    "based on the hugenholtz - van hove ( hvh ) theorem , indeed , the @xmath0 can be decomposed analytically in terms of the single - nucleon potential in asymmetric nuclear matter and the resulting expressions are quite general and independent of the detailed nature of the nucleon interactions , providing an important and physically more transparent approach to extract information on the symmetry energy from the isospin dependence of strong interaction in nuclear medium and understand why the symmetry energy predicted from various models is so uncertain  @xcite . in these works , the decomposition of @xmath0",
    "is based on non - relativistic framework .",
    "it is thus of great interest to explore more general decomposition within relativistic covariant framework , which is the main motivation of the present work .",
    "the relativistic covariant formulation has made great success during the last decades in understanding many nuclear phenomena  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the microscopic relativistic covariant dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach  @xcite has achieved impressive success in describing the saturation properties of nuclear matter without any need to introduce a three - nucleon force required in the microscopic non - relativistic bhf calculations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "it has been argued that in non - relativistic calculations the three - nucleon forces must be introduced to mimic the variation of the dirac spinors in the nuclear medium contained in relativistic covariant approach  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the lorentz covariant decomposition of the nuclear mean field potential has been shown to be very important for understanding the dynamics in heavy ion collisions at relativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "these features imply that the lorentz covariance could be important for understanding the higher energy / density nuclear phenomena , e.g. , the high density behaviors of the symmetry energy .    owing to the translational , rotational and time - reversal invariance , parity conservation , and hermiticity , the lorentz covariant nucleon self - energy in the rest frame of asymmetric nuclear matter with baryon density @xmath9 and isospin asymmetry @xmath10 can be written generally as  @xcite , @xmath11where @xmath12 is isospin index ; @xmath13 is the scalar self - energy , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are , respectively , the zeroth component and the space component of the vector self - energy @xmath16 , and they all generally depend on @xmath17 , @xmath18 and the magnitude of the nucleon momentum @xmath19 ( minkowski metric is @xmath20 ) ; @xmath21 is the unit vector of momentum @xmath22",
