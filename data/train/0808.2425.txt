    "the inflationary paradigm is extremely successful in solving the horizon and flatness problems of the standard big bang cosmology , and at the same time in explaining the origin of structure in the observable universe  @xcite .",
    "however the problem of how to incorporate inflation into a concrete model of high energy particle physics remains unclear . on the observational side ,",
    "the currently available data is not precise enough to select a particular model , whereas on the theoretical side we still lack the full understanding of the dynamics of inflation . among the several mechanisms proposed for inflation",
    ", hybrid inflation @xcite continues to be a very well motivated possibility @xcite , especially from the point of view of constructing a model of inflation based on a supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of hybrid inflation is that it involves small field values below the planck scale , thereby allowing a small field expansion of the khler potential in the effective supergravity ( sugra ) theory , facilitating the connection with effective low energy particle physics models . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with two problems confronting susy hybrid inflation , namely the @xmath0-problem and the moduli stabilization problem , and show that their joint resolution seems to favor a particular class of models which are well motivated from both string theory and particle physics .    to be consistent with recent observations @xcite , implementing inflation in a quantum field theoretical context",
    "typically requires a scalar field ( at least at the effective field theory level ) , dubbed inflaton , whose potential is extremely flat .",
    "global supersymmetry provides a plethora of additional scalar fields , i.e.  the bosonic superpartners of the sm fermions .",
    "however in order to have a flat enough potential and be a viable candidate for being the inflaton , either one ( or several ) of the scalar fields has to be a gauge singlet or a flat direction in the multi - dimensional field space .",
    "one promising candidate naturally emerges from the supersymmetric seesaw mechanism , which provides a compelling and minimal explanation of the smallness of the observed neutrino masses .",
    "the superfields containing the sm - singlet right - handed neutrinos may be gauge singlets and their bosonic components , the right - handed sneutrinos , may in principle play the role of the inflaton in either chaotic inflation @xcite or hybrid inflation @xcite .    in the framework of susy models of inflation",
    "it is necessary to take into account the effects arising from the effective sugra theory , which turn out to be important even for low field values .",
    "such corrections generically occur in locally supersymmetric ( sugra ) theory ( including low energy effective sugra theories arising from string theory ) and threaten the flat direction for inflation .",
    "the dangerous corrections arise from the effective sugra potential , where the expansion of the khler potential generally leads to masses of the order of the hubble scale @xmath4 for all scalar fields , including the inflaton .",
    "such corrections to the inflaton mass would lead to a slow - roll parameter @xmath5 which would spoil inflation .",
    "this is the so - called @xmath0-problem of sugra inflation @xcite .",
    "several attempts have been made to cure the @xmath0-problem as follows .",
    "one option to treat the problem is to arrange for a small sugra induced mass by hand , e.g.  by a specific choice of the khler potential or by a general expansion of the khler potential in inverse powers of the planck scale and finally tuning the expansion parameters ( see e.g.  @xcite for examples in the context of sneutrino inflation ) .",
    "however these choices are not motivated by any symmetry argument . another way to solve",
    "the @xmath0-problem is to impose some symmetry requirement on the khler potential .",
    "for example , shift symmetry has been used in several sugra inflation model constructions @xcite .",
    "another possibility is to use a heisenberg symmetry in the khler potential which leads to a flat potential for the inflaton at tree - level  @xcite .",
    "however , using a heisenberg symmetry in order to solve the @xmath0-problem requires the introduction of a modulus field , which must be stabilized during inflation .",
    "the problem of combining moduli stabilization and inflation is also common to compactifications of the higher dimensional string theory . in the low energy",
    "effective 4-dimensional sugra theory there are several scalar fields , which are for instance related to the geometry of the internal space of the higher dimensions , and which are also called moduli fields . the requirements for the moduli fields are exactly opposite to the ones for the inflaton field .",
    "the moduli fields must be stable during inflation , in order not to spoil inflation , and must remain stabilized after inflation .",
    "the necessity of giving the moduli fields a large mass and stabilizing them at comparatively large field values is called the  moduli stabilization problem \" in the literature @xcite .",
    "it turns out that in potentially realistic sugra models it is hard to stabilize the moduli and solve the @xmath0-problem of inflation simultaneously .",
    "the moduli sector is usually not decoupled from the inflaton sector , which means that any mechanism of moduli stabilization would always have an effect on the inflaton sector . in particular , a small variation of the moduli fields",
    "can give a significant contribution to the inflationary potential , often spoiling the conditions for inflation .",
    "discussions of the problems associated with moduli stabilization and solving the @xmath0-problem , as well as directions for possible solutions , can be found in the literature : for example , in @xcite moduli stabilization is discussed in the context of chaotic type potentials with the no - scale form of the khler function .",
    "it has been noted that inflation may be achieved if the associated moduli are fixed during inflation , however at the expense of large fine - tuning .",
    "similar conclusions have been drawn recently in @xcite .",
    "the possibility of modular inflation in this context has recently been discussed in  @xcite and it has been pointed out that subleading corrections to the no - scale khler potential could help to realize consistent inflation models .",
    "the effect of couplings between moduli and inflaton sectors in hybrid models has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "there it has been found that when the usual @xmath0-problem in sugra is solved by using a shift symmetry , the moduli dynamics in general contributes a large mass to the inflaton and spoils inflation .",
    "a possible resolution to this problem has been proposed in @xcite , again using a shift symmetry . in the context of hybrid type of inflationary models ,",
    "the possibility of using a heisenberg symmetry for solving the @xmath0-problem and issues connected to the associated moduli problem were discussed in @xcite , however no explicit model has been considered .    in this paper",
    "we present a class of susy hybrid inflation models in which the @xmath0-problem is solved by a heisenberg symmetry of the khler potential . the associated modulus field is stabilized and made heavy with the help of the large vacuum energy during inflation without any fine - tuning . because of the heisenberg symmetry of the khler potential , the tree - level potential of the inflaton is flat and only lifted by radiative corrections , induced by heisenberg symmetry breaking superpotential couplings . the resulting class of models are well motivated from the point of view of string theory since they include the case of no - scale sugra khler potentials which are ubiquitous in string constructions .",
    "the models are also well motivated from the point of view of particle physics since they allow the possibility that the inflaton may be identified with the right - handed sneutrino in susy see - saw models of neutrino masses , for example as in the model of sneutrino hybrid inflation in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the general class of models considered here applies to a wider class of singlet inflaton models with heisenberg symmetry , where the inflaton field is massless during the inflationary epoch , and subsequently acquires a large mass at the end of inflation .",
    "however much of the paper is devoted to a particular example inspired by sneutrino hybrid inflation with no - scale sugra , and which we discuss in some detail in order to illustrate the approach . in the considered example",
    "we demonstrate explicitly how the modulus gets stabilized by the large vacuum energy density provided during inflation , and find that the spectral index @xmath6 is predicted to be below @xmath7 , but above about @xmath8 , while the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath9 is below @xmath10 . in extensions of this minimal model",
    "we find examples where a spectral index as low as @xmath11 can be realized .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ the model ] the general framework is outlined and our explicit example scenario is presented . in section",
    "[ diagonal basis ] we describe the background evolution of the fields for the considered example . section [ tree - level scalar potential ] contains the analysis of the relevant tree - level potential including the relevant inflaton - dependent masses of the scalar fields .",
    "the flatness of the tree - level potential is lifted by the radiative corrections which are calculated in section [ one - loop effective potential ] .",
    "moreover , it is devoted to numerical solutions of the inflationary dynamics , including the stabilization of the modulus .",
    "the predictions of the model are presented in section [ observations ] .",
    "our summary and conclusions are given in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "in the following , @xmath12 will denote the chiral superfield which contains the inflaton as scalar component .",
    "furthermore , we will introduce the superfields @xmath4 and @xmath13 , where @xmath4 contains the waterfall field of hybrid inflation and where the @xmath14-term of @xmath13 will provide the vacuum energy during inflation . in particle physics applications",
    "@xmath12 may be identified with the right - handed sneutrino , @xmath4 with a higgs field which breaks some high energy symmetry , and @xmath13 with some driving field whose @xmath14 term drives the @xmath4 vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "however for simplicity , we will consider sm singlet superfields throughout the paper , noting that our discussion may be generalized to the case where this assumption is dropped .",
    "we will consistently use the same notation for the scalar component of the superfield and the superfield itself .",
    "we start by considering the following general framework where the superpotential has the form @xmath15 and where the khler potential is of the type is set to one . ]",

    "@xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are dimensionless parameters .    in the scenario we have in mind the scalar component of @xmath13 only contributes the large vacuum energy during inflation by its f - term , but remains at zero during inflation .",
    "the waterfall field @xmath4 is responsible for ending inflation by a second order phase transition when it develops a tachyonic instability at some critical value of @xmath12 . below this critical value",
    ", @xmath4 acquires a large vev determined by the scale @xmath28 and also gives a large mass to the inflaton @xmath12 . as main features of the general framework we require that , as in sneutrino hybrid inflation , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 but @xmath32 during inflation .",
    "it has been emphasized in @xcite that these criteria are desirable for solving the @xmath0-problem using a heisenberg symmetry .",
    "before we discuss an explicit example where we demonstrate how the modulus is stabilized consistent with inflation , let us discuss in general terms the requirements on the functions @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . to start with , @xmath20 has to be chosen such that the vacuum energy during inflation is provided by the @xmath14-term @xmath33 .",
    "typically , @xmath20 depends only on @xmath4 , and we note that it may also contain effective couplings like @xmath34 ( as e.g.  in @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath21 has to lead to a positive @xmath12-dependent mass squared for @xmath4 via @xmath35 during inflation .",
    "examples for possible @xmath21 are terms like @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "if , on the other hand , only one power of @xmath4 appears in a term of @xmath21 , this would give a tree - level contribution to the @xmath12-potential which may spoil inflation .",
    "finally , @xmath22 together with @xmath23 shape the potential for @xmath24 ( which contains the modulus @xmath17 and which , as we will show , is the field which has to be stabilized during inflation in order to solve the moduli problem in the context of inflation ) .",
    "the main idea here is that the khler potential term @xmath38 during inflation and can ( in combination with a suitably chosen @xmath39 , e.g.  of no - scale form ) efficiently stabilize @xmath24 during inflation .",
    "the stabilization of the modulus during inflation is thus driven by a different mechanism than after inflation and in the following we will assume that additional terms in the superpotential or khler potential which stabilize the modulus after inflation can be neglected during inflation .",
    "the explicit example model which we will investigate in the remainder of the paper is defined by the superpotential is the singlet sneutrino superfield , however we emphasize that it can be any sm - singlet superfield .",
    "to be precise , the considered superpotential is a variation of that used in the model of @xcite where instead of @xmath40 in the bracket a more complicated term @xmath41 was considered .",
    "we would like to note that we have verified that a variant of the model , where the coupling @xmath42 is replaced by the renormalizable coupling @xmath43 , leads to similar results . ] @xmath44 and the khler potential @xmath45 where @xmath25 , @xmath46 , @xmath26 and @xmath47 are dimensionless parameters and @xmath48 is a mass scale .",

    "the first term of eq .   is the standard susy hybrid inflation term , with the difference that @xmath13 stays at zero both during and after inflation while @xmath4 is kept at zero during inflation but acquires a vev when @xmath12 drops below a critical value .",
    "this term essentially provides a large vacuum energy density during inflation and a vev for @xmath4 after inflation .",
    "the second term induces a mass for @xmath4 during inflation when @xmath53 , which keeps it at zero .",
    "after inflation , the vev @xmath54 gives a mass to @xmath12 .",
    "the purpose of the coupling @xmath26 is to give a large mass for the @xmath13-field , which keeps it at zero both during and after inflation .",

    ", the term has negligible effect on the predictions for the observable quantities .",

    "although the no - scale form is particularly well motivated , in general this assumption might be relaxed and a different function @xmath39 might be chosen .",

    "since it includes the commonly encountered case of no - scale sugra khler potential , and from the perspective of particle physics since a natural candidate for the inflaton in this class of models is the right - handed sneutrino , i.e.  the superpartner of the sm - singlet right - handed neutrino , which is massless during the inflationary epoch and subsequently acquires a large mass at the end of inflation .    in order to illustrate the approach we have developed in some detail a specific example motivated by sneutrino hybrid inflation with no - scale sugra . in this example",

    "in this model the singlet @xmath13 is stabilized during inflation due to its non - canonical khler potential , and since the right - handed sneutrino contained in @xmath12 has its mass protected by the heisenberg symmetry , it becomes a natural candidate for the inflaton , with the associated modulus field stabilized and made heavy with the help of the large vacuum energy during inflation ( where we have not addressed the problem of the stability of the modulus after inflation ) .",
    "because of the heisenberg symmetry the tree - level potential of the sneutrino inflaton is flat and only lifted by radiative corrections ( induced by heisenberg symmetry breaking superpotential couplings ) which we have studied and found to play a key part in the inflationary dynamics .",
    "we have found that in the considered setup the spectral index @xmath6 typically lies below @xmath7 with typical values shown in fig .  [ paramspace ] for the case of the model defined in eqs .   and   with @xmath39 given in eq .",
