    "the nuclear dynamics is a complex problem joining all the puzzling aspects of quantum mechanics to the difficulties of many - body systems . besides these factors",
    ", the strong interaction , which is up to date not completely understood , adds new challenges for calculations in the nonperturbative regime .",
    "collective nuclear phenomena , as fission , particle or cluster evaporation and nuclear fragmentation , offer the possibility of studying those complex features of the nuclear dynamics . aside the interest from the fundamental nuclear physics , there are many applications where the knowledge of fragment formation would be helpful .",
    "for instance , information on intermediate mass fragments ( imf ) cross section is relevant for the design of accelerator - driven systems ( ads ) and radioactive ion - beam ( rib ) facilities and also in the study of resistance of materials to radiation .",
    "imf are particles with @xmath1 4 but lighter than fission fragments , i.e. , @xmath2100",
    ".    fragments in high energy nuclear collisions are produced by spallation , fission , and multifragmentation .",
    "j. hufner @xcite using as classification parameters the mass number of the fragments , @xmath3 , and their multiplicity , @xmath4 , defined the processes in the following way :    * spallation is the process in which only one heavy fragment with mass close to the target mass @xmath5 is formed ( a special case of spallation is the so - called deep spallation where @xmath6 but @xmath7 ) ; * fission is the process in which @xmath8 and @xmath3 is arround @xmath9 ; * multifragmentation is the process where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "emission of light particles , with atomic number @xmath12 , usually dominates the yield of reaction products for light target nuclei , while for heavy targets also spallation and fission residua give significant contribution . in this scenario",
    "the formation of imf can happen through one of the following processes :    * fission of nuclei mass number in the range 120 - 130 @xcite .",
    "* spallation including the emission of imf , the so - called associated spallation @xcite .",
    "* multifragmentation of heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "following this reasoning , as discussed below , for heavy targets the multifragmentation would be the only mechanism for the formation of imf . indeed in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that in the reaction of 3.65@xmath3  @xmath13pb with @xmath14h the formation of @xmath15c nuclei presents the characteristics of multifragmentation , with a possible small contribution of binary process .",
    "however the formation of imf was observed even at lower energies @xcite and in this case the dynamics was characteristic of a binary process with no evidences for multifragmantation .",
    "hence the study of production of imf from heavy target nuclei at intermediate energies can give new information on the nuclear dynamics .",
    "in the present work our objective is the measurement of the cross sections of residual nuclei in the imf region for reactions on heavy nuclei induced by 660 mev protons .",
    "the experimental data will be analysed by comparison with monte carlo calculations with the crisp code @xcite , as described below .",
    "it is generally assumed that at intermediate energies the nuclear reaction proceeds in two stages : 1 ) the incoming fast projectile collides with a single nucleon or with several nucleons transferring momentum and energy to the nucleus and leaves the nucleus accompanied by several light particles ; 2 ) the residual nucleus achieves statistical equilibrium and some nucleons or clusters are emitted from the excited nucleus . at higher energies , when the excitation energy of the residual nucleus per nucleon is @xmath16  3.5  mev / a , the multifragmentation of the nucleus can take place .",
    "this reaction mechanism differs from evaporation since it describes a sudden breakup of the nucleus instead of the successive emission of particles .    in the framework described above the formation of imf from heavy targets at intermediate energies",
    "could only be attributed to fission inside a long evaporation chain ( both pre- and post - fission ) , which is very unlike .",
    "in fact the fission probability of heavy nuclei drops very fast as mass number decreases @xcite , so long evaporation chains would lead to lower fissility nuclei .",
    "another possibility would be a very long evaporation chain leading to light spallation products .",
    "this mechanism is limited by the maximum excitation energy allowed before multifragmentation becomes dominant , because the evaporation would cool down the nucleus before the imf region is reached . increasing the excitation energy above the 3.5  mev /",
    "a threshold would only increase the contribution from multifragmentation and in this way imf formed in reactions with heavy targets should be dominated by fragmentation products .",
    "hence , for excitation energies below the multifragmentation threshold the formation of imf from heavy nuclei would be very unlike .",
    "a comprehensive set of data on the proton - induced reaction of @xmath17u at 1 agev @xcite presents the cross sections of a 254 light nuclides in the element range @xmath18 measured in inverse kinematics . on the base of a detailed study the experimental kinematical information the authors qualified such nuclides as binary decay products of a fully equilibrated compound nucleus , whereas clear indications for fast breakup processes was absent . these result",
    "are corroborated by those from ref .",
    "@xcite and @xcite and are in contradiction with the scenario described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one way to overcome the problem posed by binary production of imf from heavy targets is by including the possibility of highly asymmetric fission with fragments which can still undergo evaporation to form at the end a nuclide in the region of imf .",
    "this process corresponds to a modification in the classification given by hufner for fission by using a less restrictive definition for fission , since in this case the fragment would have mass number quite different from @xmath19 .",
    "this superasymmetric mechanism would corroborate the conjecture that evaporation and fission are manifestation of a single mechanism , called binary decay @xcite .",
    "a complete study of this possibility involves the description of the entire process from the primary interaction of the incident proton up to the evaporation of nucleons from the fission fragments .",
    "a task like this can only be performed through the monte carlo method .    in this work",
    "we use the crisp code to calculate all the features of the nuclear dynamics during the reaction .",
    "crisp is a monte carlo code for simulating nuclear reactions @xcite that assumes that nuclear reactions can be separated in the two stages mentioned above : the intranuclear cascade and the evaporation / fission process .",
    "this code has been developed during the last 25 years , while it has successfully described many different reactions .",
    "the main characteristic of the intranuclear cascade calculation with crisp is the multi - collisional approach @xcite , where the full nuclear dynamics is considered in each step of the cascade . in this process",
    "the nucleus is modeled by an infinite square - potential which determines the level structure for protons and neutrons .",
    "the effects of the nuclear potential are present in the transmission of the particles through the nuclear surface or through an effective mass according to wallecka mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "this multicollisional calculation is accomplished by constantly updating all the kinematical variables of all particles inside the nucleus , what opens the possibility of treating more realistically many nuclear phenomena .",
    "for instance , the antisymmetrization criteria , which determines a strict observation of the pauli principle is performed through a strict observance of the pauli principle , allowing the use of physical criteria for separating the intranuclear cascade from the thermalization process @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of such approach can be verified in processes which are predominantly dependent on the intranuclear cascade step , as kaon production and hypernuclei decay , which have been studied with crisp leading to results compatible with experiments @xcite .",
    "also the fission of several nuclei has been studied in the quasi - deuteron region @xcite , where pauli blocking mechanism is very important in the determination of the residual nucleus .",
    "the evaporation / fission competition was first studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , giving for the first time an explanation to the saturation of the fissility of heavy nuclei below the unit observed in photofission experiments at intermediate energies @xcite , and afterward it was extended to energies up to 3.5  gev @xcite , showing also in this case good agreement with experimental data from ref @xcite .",
    "after the nuclear thermalization , the competition between fission and evaporation processes , which includes neutrons , protons and alpha - particles , is determined through the ratios between their respective widths according to the weisskopf model for evaporation and to the bohr - wheeler model for fission .",

    "the excitation energy of the compound nucleus left is modified by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the kinetic energy of the emitted particle .",
    "if the nucleus undergoes fission , the the fragments are determined according to the multimodal - random neck rupture model(mm - nrm ) @xcite , which takes into account the collective effects of nuclear deformation during fission through a liquid - drop model and single - particle effects through microscopic shell - model corrections .",
    "the microscopic corrections create valleys in the space of elongation and mass number , each valley corresponding to one different fission mode @xcite .    according to the mm - nrm the fragment mass distributions",
    "are determined by the uncorrelated sum of the different fission modes . at present",
    "it is supposed that there are three distinct fission modes for the heavy nuclei : symmetric syperlong ( s ) mode and two asymmetric modes standard i ( s1 ) , standard ii ( s2 ) . in the superlong mode",
    "the fissioning system with mass @xmath35 presents itself at the saddle - point in an extremely deformed shape with a long neck connecting the two forming fragments , which will have masses around @xmath36 .",
    "the standard i mode is characterized by influence of the spherical neutron shell @xmath37 and of the proton shell @xmath38 in the heavy fragments with masses @xmath39 .",
    "the standard ii mode is characterized by influence the deformed neutron shell closure @xmath40 and proton shell @xmath41 in the heavy fragments with masses @xmath42 .",
    "the fission cross section as a function of mass number is then obtained by the sum of three gaussian functions , corresponding to the three modes mentioned above @xcite : @xmath43 , \\label{masstotal }   \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is the mean mass number determining the center of gaussian functions ; and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and d@xmath47 are the intensity , dispersion and position parameters of the @xmath48 gaussian functions . the indexes @xmath49 , @xmath50 designate the asymmetric and symmetric components .    the crisp code works on an event - by - event basis , and therefore the parameter @xmath44 in eq.3 is completely determined by the mass of the fissioning nucleus @xmath35 , that is , @xmath51 . the quantities",

    "the values of a@xmath53 + a@xmath54=2@xmath44 is treated as the masses of nuclei that undergo fission in the respective channel .",
    "one important observable of fission is the charge distribution of a given isobaric chain with mass number @xmath3 .",
    "it is assumed that the charge distribution of the fission fragments is well described by a gaussian function characterized by the most probable charge , @xmath57 , of an isobaric chains @xmath3 ( centroid of the gaussian function ) and the associate width parameter , @xmath58 of the distribution as following @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the independent cross section of the nuclide , @xmath61 .",

    "the identification of the reaction products , and the determination of their production cross section , were performed using data from @xcite by means of half - lives , energies and intensities of @xmath74-transition of radioactive fragments .    in the absence of a parent isotope",
    ", the cross section of fragment production for each fragment is determined using the following equation : @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes the cross section of the reaction fragment production ( mb ) ; @xmath77 is the area under the photopeak ; @xmath78 is the projectile beam intensity ( min@xmath79 ) ; @xmath80 is the number of target nuclei ( in 1/@xmath81 units ) ; @xmath82 is the irradiation time ; @xmath83 is the time of exposure between the end of the irradiation and the beginning of the measurement ; @xmath84 is the time measurement ; @xmath85 is the decay constant ( min@xmath79 ) ; @xmath86 is the intensity of @xmath74-transitions ; @xmath87 is the total coefficient of @xmath74-ray absorption in target and detector materials , and @xmath88 is the @xmath74-ray - detection efficiency .    usually , the cross section of an isotope production in the reaction under investigation is direct and independent ( i ) of the parent nuclei decay , and the cross section is determined by eq .",
    "( [ g1 ] ) .",
    "if the yield of a given isotope receives a contribution from the @xmath89-decay of neighboring unstable isobars , the cross section calculation becomes more complicated @xcite .    if the formation probability for the parent isotope is known from experimental data or if it can be estimated on the basis of other sources , then the independent cross sections of daughter nuclei can be calculated by the relation :    @xmath90,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the subscripts @xmath3 and @xmath91 label variables referring to , respectively , the parent and the daughter nucleus ; the coefficient @xmath92 specifies the fraction of nuclei @xmath3 decaying to nuclei @xmath91 ( this coefficient provides the idea of how much the @xmath93-decay affects our data ; and @xmath94 , when the contribution from the @xmath93-decay corresponds 100% ) ; and @xmath77 is the total photo peak area associated with the decays of the daughter and parent isotopes .",
    "the effect of the forerunner can be negligible in some limit cases  for example , in the case where the half - life of the parent nucleus is very long , or in the case where the fraction of its contribution is very small . in the case",

    "the total fission cross sections are 1140 mb for @xmath17u and 1360 mb for @xmath73np .",
    "the s3 width is somewhat larger than those for s1 and s2 but smaller than that for s mode .",
    "the most stricking feature of the superasymmetric mode is the mass number gap around 60 a.m.u . in respect with the symmetric fragment for both cases studied here .",
    "our results confirm that imf at intermediate energies are formed predominantly through a binary process , and that it is described by a superasymmetric fission mode .",
    "although a good description of the fragment production was obtained here with the fisson mechanism , it is not possible to exclude that the same description of the experiemntal data would not be obtained by a mechanism of evaporation which includes the associated spallation , with emissions of fragments heavier than the alpha - particle .",
    "in fact it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , at least in the ground - state , a global description of fission and cluster emission would be possible in a single theoretical framework . in",
    "would be interesting to investigate if such an approach would be valid also for the decay of excited compound nuclei .",
    "the cross sections for fragment production in proton - induced fission on @xmath106u and @xmath107np at 660 mev were measured at the lnr phasatron ( jinr ) .",
    "the fragment mass distributions covering the region 20@xmath101200 , allowed the study of intermediate mass fragments ( imf ) with 20@xmath10170 .",

    "this hypothesis was tested with the use of the crisp code by including an addition superasymmetric fission mode described according to the mm - nrm approach .",
    "the results show that it is indeed possible to give an accurate description of the fragment production in the entire region , 20@xmath101200 by the evaporation / fission mechanism adopted in the crisp code with the usual fission modes , namely , one symmetric and two asymmetric , and including a forth superasymmetric mode .",
    "this last mode produces fragments that are around 60 a.m.u .",
