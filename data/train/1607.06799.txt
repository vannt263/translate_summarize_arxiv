    "the discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider  ( lhc )  @xcite , opened a new era of exploration of the electroweak sector of the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "the measured value of the higgs mass uniquely specifies all of the couplings and turns the sm into a fully predictive theory .",
    "hence , we are at a position to perform stringent tests of our current modelling of these fundamental interactions .",
    "this is only possible if we are in possession of precise theoretical predictions for the higgs production cross sections .",
    "most of the higgs boson particles observed at hadron colliders are produced through the process of gluon fusion .",
    "this channel is known to exhibit very slow convergence in perturbative quantum chromodynamics  ( qcd ) . at lhc energies , the next - to - leading order  ( nlo ) corrections to the total cross section for the inclusive production of the higgs boson in gluon fusion turn out to be as large as 70% , and the next - to - next - to - leading order  ( nnlo ) corrections",
    "increase the cross section by another  30%  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty of the nnlo result , arising from the missing higher orders and obtained by the standard renormalization and factorization scale variations , is estimated at around 10% , and is hence at the level of the experimental accuracy of the run 1 lhc measurements .",
    "this large uncertainty at nnlo has motivated the efforts to further improve the precession by calculating the full next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order  ( ) result for the inclusive higgs boson production in gluon fusion  @xcite .",
    "adding these contributions to the predictions for the cross section reduces their scale uncertainties down to the level of  3% .",
    "apart from the inclusive higgs cross section , which is the most fundamental quantity , as it enables one to predict the total number of higgs particles produced at a given energy and luminosity , one is also equally interested in more differential observables . therefore",
    ", a significant amount of work has gone also into obtaining predictions for differential cross sections for higgs production in gluon fusion beyond nlo . in particular , calculations",
    "in which nlo results are matched to parton shower  ( ps ) have been performed with the minlo method  @xcite .",
    "recently , nnlo+ps matched results were computed with the un@xmath9lops technique  @xcite as well as with an extended version of minlo  @xcite combined with the hnnlo program  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we present nlo+ps predictions for various differential distributions computed with the approach  @xcite .    the  method for matching of the complete nlo qcd corrections to hard processes with lo parton shower monte carlo generators ( psmc )",
    "was first introduced ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 production in hadron collisions ( the drell  yan process , dy ) and also presented in ref .",
    "then , it was extended to higgs - boson production in gluon ",
    "gluon fusion in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also ref .",
    "these developments follow the initial study in refs .",
    "@xcite on the inclusion of fixed - order nlo qcd corrections to the hard process in lo psmc through an appropriate monte carlo weight .",
    "this study was done with the use of some dedicated toy - model parton - shower generator and for gluonstrahlung from quarks only , albeit for two processes : the dy production and deep - inelastic electron ",
    "proton scattering ( dis ) .",
    "the first realistic numerical results ( total cross sections and distributions of @xmath0 transverse momentum and rapidity ) of the method , based on its implementation in the  @xcite psmc , were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite for the dy process .",
    "the results were compared with the fixed - order nlo predictions of  @xcite and those of other nlo - psmc matching methods , namely  @xcite and  @xcite , as well as with the fixed - order nnlo calculations of  @xcite .",
    "satisfactory agreement with other nlo calculations was found .",
    "moreover , for the boson transverse momentum the agreement with the nnlo predictions was better than for and . in that paper some advantages of the method over the and techniques were discussed .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the concept of the monte carlo ( mc ) factorisation scheme was introduced as a necessary ingredient of the method .",
    "appropriate mc - scheme parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) were defined and constructed from pdfs in the standard @xmath10 scheme . however , those pdfs included only contributions from parton  parton transitions that were sufficient for dy process in the nlo approximation  in the following we denote them with @xmath11 .",
    "the complete pdfs in the mc factorisation scheme , including all the lo parton  parton transitions , were defined , computed and compared with the @xmath10 pdfs in ref .",
    "@xcite , where higgs - boson production from initial - state gluons was considered . in that paper only the values of total cross section for the higgs production at the lhc were shown .",
    "more results for this process will be presented in the following .",
    "however , before presenting the higgs results , we first validate the implementation of the method in the program with respect to its previous implementation in for the dy process",
    ". the implementation of the method will be our basic platform for its future developments and applications to other processes .",
    "then , we will compare the results for the dy process based on the complete mc - scheme pdfs with those where the @xmath11 pdfs , as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , are used .",
    "for the process of the higgs - production in gluon ",
    "gluon fusion , we present the results for the total cross section and the distributions of the higgs transverse momentum and rapidity at the lhc .",
    "the predictions of the method are compared with those of the fixed - order nlo and nnlo calculations of  @xcite and  @xcite as well as with the results of the nlo - psmc matching approaches of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we also confront the predictions of all the above matching methods with the lhc data of the atlas experiment  @xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following : in section  2 , after describing the set - up for our numerical computations , we present and discuss the results of the method , first for the dy process and then for the higgs production in gluon ",
    "gluon fusion at the lhc .",
    "section  3 concludes our work and provides some outlook for future developments .",
    "for the numerical evaluation of the cross sections at the lhc for the proton ",
    "proton collision energy of @xmath12tev we have chosen the following set of standard model ( sm ) input parameters : @xmath13 and to use the @xmath14-scheme  @xcite for the electroweak sector of the standard model . to compute the hadronic cross section we also use the mstw2008 lo set of parton distribution functions  @xcite , and take the renormalization and factorization scales to be @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass of the @xmath17 or higgs boson for the respective processes . for simplicity",
    "we set the higgs boson to be stable . in the case of the drell  yan process ,",
    "detector acceptance cuts are imposed only on the invariant mass of the final - state lepton pair ( @xmath0-boson ) : @xmath18 for the higgs - production process we do not apply any cuts .",
    "the results of the method implemented on top of the psmc  @xcite for the drell  yan process were already presented in ref .",
    "here we use these results to validate a new implementation of in the program @xcite .",
    "this version of the herwig psmc features a new parton - shower algorithm based on the catani  seymour ( cs ) dipole @xcite formalism , therefore it is well suited to the implementation of the method .",
    "details on how to implement the method in the cs - dipole psmc are given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the dy process and in ref .",
    "@xcite for the higgs - boson production . in short",
    ", it amounts to replacing the @xmath10 pdfs with the mc - scheme pdfs and applying to each event generated by psmc an appropriate monte carlo weight that introduces the nlo qcd correction to a given hard process .",
    "this weight is positive - definite and can be computed simply from information provided in an event record .      as a basis for this validation",
    ", we first compare the lo - level predictions from and with those of using an identical choice of parameters ( see section [ ssec : setup ] ) .",
    "the results presented in table  [ tab : z - lo - settings - val ] show a very good agreement ( within statistical errors ) between different programs .",
    ".values of the total cross section with statistical errors at the born level for the drell  yan process with pdfs in the @xmath10 factorisation scheme . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the values of the total cross section with statistical errors for the higgs - boson production process , from the method compared to the results of the and approaches implemented in are shown in table  [ tab : h - nlo - settings - val ] .",
    "is the default implementation of the method which restricts the transverse momentum of parton - shower emissions to be less than the factorisation scale ( making it similar to ) , while is closer to its original implementation @xcite which has no restrictions of the transverse momentum of parton - shower emissions .",
    "we can see that , as expected , both and give the same total cross sections .",
    "the method gives a slightly higher value of the cross section than to the other methods .",
    "this can be explained by beyond - nlo contributions , which are partially accounted for in the result .",
    "+         +     +    in fig .  [",
    "fig : nlo - h ] we present the distributions of the higgs - boson transverse momentum @xmath19 and rapidity @xmath20 , comparing the results from with and .",
    "+ all the predictions , except for , agree within a few per - cent for the @xmath21 range from @xmath22gev to @xmath23gev and for the rapidity range @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "larger differences between and / are seen for @xmath25 .",
    "the main reason for them is that the and methods restrict the value of the transverse momentum of parton - shower emissions to be below the @xmath26 value , while in the there is not such a restriction .",
    "this can be seen in the left - upper plot where a sharp drop of the @xmath21 spectrum above @xmath26 is visible in the case of and , while for ( and also for which has no restriction on the transverse momentum of parton - shower emissions ) this spectrum is smooth . of course , such differences are acceptable within the nlo approximation .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : nlo - h - atlas ] we compare the predictions for the distributions of the higgs - boson transverse momentum and rapidity , the number of jets and the transverse momentum of the hardest jet from , and with the atlas data collected in the lhc run  1 at the collision energy @xmath27tev  @xcite .",
    "note that we compare theoretical results for the gluon - gluon fusion mode only with the complete experimental results .",
    "however , the gluon - gluon fusion mode dominates and it accounts for about 95% of the cross section .",
    "all the data points lie above the theoretical predictions , although the experimental errors are large .",
    "of the three nlo - psmc matching methods seems to be the closest to the atlas measurements .",
    "in this paper we have presented the numerical results of the method for the drell  yan ( dy ) process and the higgs - boson production in gluon ",
    "gluon fusion at the lhc for the collision energy @xmath27tev .",
    "firstly , we have validated the implementation of the method in the psmc by comparing its results for the dy process with previous results obtained with the -based implementation .",
    "then , we have presented new results for the dy process with the complete mc - scheme pdfs , recently defined in ref .",
    "these results have been compared with those for the older variant of the mc - scheme pdfs , called here the @xmath11 pdfs , which were introduced in @xcite exclusively for the dy process .",
    "the agreement between the results for these two variants of the mc - scheme pdfs has been found at the level of @xmath28 , which is well within the nlo accuracy .    our main numerical results in this paper concerns the higgs - boson production process .",
    "we have presented the results for the total cross section , as well as distributions of the higgs - boson transverse momentum and rapidity .",
    "the predictions have been compared with those of the and methods .",
    "a good agreement , within the nlo accuracy , has been found between the default options of these methods .",
    "larger discrepancies have been seen with the original option of for lower @xmath19 , while for higher @xmath19 agrees better with this options of than with the other methods , which results from the restriction on the transverse momentum of parton - shower emissions to below the factorisation scale in the latter ones .",
    "finally , the theoretical predictions of the above nlo - psmc matching methods have been compared with the atlas data from lhc run  1 for several observables for the higgs - production process .",
    "all the matching methods underestimate the atlas measurements , however the experimental errors are large . the results seem to be the closest to the data point .    as a next step in our numerical predictions with the method we plan to perform a more detailed study of the drell  yan processes , both the neutral ( @xmath0 ) and charged ( @xmath29 ) ones , in presence of experimental cuts and a focus on leptonic observables . in order to do this ,",
    "we need to supplement the nlo - correcting weights with appropriate spin correlations for vector - boson decay products ( which is not needed in the case of the scalar higgs boson ) .",
    "this can be done rather easily within the psmc algorithm using the method proposed in ref .",
    "then , we plan to apply the method to other processes investigated at the lhc , first of all electroweak - boson pair - production ( @xmath30 , where @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 production",
    ". this would be an important test of feasibility and universality of the method .",
    "we are grateful to simon platzer for the useful discussions and his help with the dipole parton shower implemented in .",
    "we are indebted to the cloud computing for science and economy project ( cc1 ) at ifj pan ( poig 02.03.03 - 00 - 033/09 - 04 ) in krakw whose resources were used to carry out all the numerical computations for this project .",
