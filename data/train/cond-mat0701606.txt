    "inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) with scanning tunneling microscope , iets - stm , is a well - established technique , starting with an important experiment by stipe @xcite these experiments show step like features in the tunneling current and local density of states ( dos ) .",
    "the physical explanation of the effect is straightforward : once the energy of the tunneling electron exceeds the energy required to excite local vibrations , there is a new scattering process that contributes to the scattering of electrons due to inelastic excitation of the local mode.@xcite the local vibrational modes can be seen in differential conductance measurements as side - bands to the main ( elastic ) conductance peak.@xcite recently , iets - stm was used to measure the spin excitations of individual magnetic atoms.@xcite in addition , recent experiments show dominant inelastic channels which are strongly spatially localized to particular regions of a molecule.@xcite    improvements in spectroscopic and microscopic measurements have provided new information about fundamental aspects of scattering and interactions in the solid state .",
    "recently , stm technique has evolved from imaging of surfaces,@xcite to spin polarized tips for magnetic sensitivity of the read - out@xcite and spin - polarized injection of the tunneling current used in the measurements.@xcite stm has been also used to detect kondo interactions between conduction electrons and single atomic spins@xcite and to study the properties of individual atoms.@xcite    we propose to use resolution of stm to address spatially resolved inelastic tunneling features produced by local inelastic scattering of the molecule both near the scattering center and at far distances .",
    "the `` fingerprint '' of the inelastic scattering will be present even away from the scattering center . using",
    "local iets - stm would enable measurements of the standing waves produced by inelastic scattering off impurities , which could be revealed as waves seen in the _ second derivative _ @xmath1 .",
    "for the simplest model of parabolic conduction band these waves will be seen as standing waves with period set by the fermi momentum @xmath0 .",
    "these standing waves are seen in the oscillations of the @xmath1 and are _ similar but qualitatively different _ from the conventional friedel oscillations .    in case of regular friedel oscillations the charge that screens off the impurity exhibit oscillations at large distances from the impurity .",
    "recent stm measurements have observed friedel oscillations in the elastic scattering channels on surfaces with atomic impurities adsorbed on the surface.@xcite these oscillations are seen in a wide range of bias as they reflect screening of the charge by electron states in the whole bandwidth .",
    "inelastic scattering of surface electrons off the molecules may be viewed as _ inelastic _",
    "friedel oscillations produced by the electron states that are involved in screening .",
    "inelastic friedel oscillations are seen only in the narrow window of energies near the energy of the mode @xmath3 at which inelastic scattering occurs , in contrast to conventional friedel screening .",
    "it was recently proposed to use iets - stm to address the inelastic scattering features in the bi2212 superconductors.@xcite in the case of superconductors , the situation is more involved since one has to deal with the more complicated band structure of bi2212 and with the inelastic scattering off the distributed bosonic modes .",
    "the work presented here allows one to test similar ideas in a more controlled set up where the metal surface and molecular modes are well understood .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] we introduce a model which describe the addressed issue and some numerical results are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec - results ] .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec .",
    "[ sec - conclusions ] .",
    "the system we consider consists of a two - dimensional surface on which inelastic scattering centers are randomly distributed . for simplicity , we assume that the impurities are distributed sufficiently far from each other so that their mutual interactions can be neglected .",
    "all vibrational modes have energy @xmath3 and are assumed to be the same as they would come from the same type of molecules .",
    "we use the hamiltonian for the local vibrational modes , coupled to electrons via holstein coupling with interactions assumed to occur only at the single impurity site , so that @xmath4 here , a surface electron is created ( annihilated ) by @xmath5 at the energy @xmath6 .",
    "the strength of the electron - phonon interaction is given by the parameter @xmath7 , whereas @xmath3 is the mode of the bare phonon which is created ( annihilated ) by @xmath8 .",
    "the features we are considering should be seen in the second derivative of the tunneling current with respect to the bias voltage @xmath9 in real space , i.e. @xmath10 .",
    "this quantity is directly proportional to the frequency derivative of the local dos . in second order perturbation theory ,",
    "this amounts to taking the frequency derivative of the correction to the density of states , @xmath11 , due to the influence of the impurity scattering .",
    "the real space electron green function ( gf ) is given by @xmath12 with the zero gf in two spatial dimensions @xmath13 here , the bare electron fourier transformed gf @xmath14 . using standard procedure for frequency summation ,",
    "the self - energy @xmath15 is found as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the bare phonon gfs .    due to these definitions",
    ", it is clear that the correction to the local dos is given by @xmath18 since the effects from inelastic scattering are included in the self - energy , we evaluate @xmath19 , which is directly proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "sharp feature in self - energy @xmath20 is connected to the inelastic scattering feature . noting that @xmath21 , our calculations simplify to @xmath22g_0(0,\\bfr;\\omega)$ ] .",
    "we thus find that @xmath23 analytical continuation , e.g. @xmath24 , of the self - energy in eq . (",
    "[ eq - s ] ) gives the imaginary part @xmath25 .",
    "\\label{eq - ims}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the correction to the local dos provides the oscillation in real space . the electron - phonon interaction gives rise to an increased local dos for frequencies @xmath26 .",
    "we find that @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath27 where @xmath28 taking @xmath29 , as @xmath30 , we expect to find sharp features in @xmath10 around @xmath31 for low temperatures . hence , our simplified analytical calculations show that inelastic impurities that couple to the surface electrons give rise to friedel oscillations in the real space image of @xmath10 .",
    "one important point that we also need to address is the role of the dephasing in the inelastic scattering process .",
    "we are dealing with the inelastic scattering process in which the incoming and outgoing electron waves have different energy .",
    "energy transferred to / from the inelastic center implies the phase change and hence the interference of the incoming and outgoing waves will be affected by dephasing caused by scattering .",
    "this dephasing process would occur even at @xmath32 and hence has nothing to do with the thermal scattering . in the limit of small boson energy @xmath33 dephasing",
    "is small and is not going to destroy the interference of the incoming and outgoing waves .",
    "qualitatively we can estimate the change in the phase as a result of inelastic scattering as @xmath34 . here",
    "@xmath35 is the energy transferred to / from the electron and @xmath36 is the typical time for the collision of electron with the impurity of size @xmath37 , assumed to be on the unit cell size",
    ". then we estimate @xmath38 and obtain @xmath39 therefore the interference between incoming and outgoing waves will survive as long as energy transferred in the collision is small .",
    "although the analytical calculations in sec . [ sec - model ] clearly shows oscillatory response of the inelastic scattering , we provide in this section some numerical results to emphasize our proposal .",
    "the numerical calculations of @xmath11 are based on the full expression presented in appendix [ app - dn ] .    , for @xmath40 k.,width=302 ]    from eq .",
    "( [ eq - ddn ] ) it is clear that the oscillations only have a radial component , because the assumed electron - phonon coupling is rotationally invariant .",
    "this feature is manifested in fig .",
    "[ fig - onespot ] , where the upper panel shows the spatial dependence of @xmath41 at the resonance energy @xmath42 .",
    "the lower panel shows the intensity of @xmath43 , on the line @xmath44 , which corresponds to the dashed line in the upper panel .",
    "the features in @xmath45 depend on the spatial position _ and _ on the frequency . in fig .",
    "[ fig - dnr ] , which shows a contour plot of @xmath46 , we illustrate the fact that the inelastic friedel oscillations occur in a narrow interval around @xmath31 .",
    "the plot clearly illustrates that there is hardly any intensity at all , for frequencies off the phonon mode @xmath3 .     at @xmath47 k.,width=302 ]    the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig - fourspots ] illustrates the iets - stm resonance signal on a surface with four inelastic scattering centers , analogous to the plot in fig .",
    "[ fig - onespot ] .",
    "as expected from the wave character of the signal , the pattern on the surface is because of interfering friedel oscillations from the four scattering centers .",

    "( [ eq - ddn ] ) and ( [ eq - ds ] ) , as the frequency is varied .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - dn ] ( solid ) .",
    "these local extrema correspond to steps in @xmath48 , which is also clear in fig .",
    "[ fig - dn ] ( dashed ) .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq - ds ] ) we find that intensity of the peaks in @xmath54 is highly temperature dependent , which is illustrated in fig .",

    "the plots have been artificially broadened.,width=302 ]    we propose a scanning technique that allows one to visualize the oscillations in the inelastic scattering produced by the local modes .",
    "standard way to image iets of the molecule is to measure @xmath1 locally near the scattering center.@xcite we point out that the `` fingerprint '' of the inelastic scattering will be present even away from the scattering center .",
    "the incoming electron wave donates / absorbs energy from the inelastic scattering center . in the process of inelastic scattering",
    "the incoming and outgoing electron waves interfere .",
    "this interference will can be clearly seen in the real space oscillations of the second derivative @xmath1 with characteristic momentum @xmath0 .",
    "the important point is that for the flat density of states the interference between states that undergone inelastic scattering will only be present at the bias @xmath59 and not at other energies .",
    "this makes the proposed effect very different from the conventional friedel oscillations that occur for elastic scattering and are present for the wide range of energies as the whole band of electrons participates in screening .",
    "we also argue that as long as the energy difference between these states is small compared with the fermi energy of electrons , the dephasing in the process of scattering is small and hence interference is preserved .",
    "the technique , proposed here , can be applied to the inelastic scattering of the electrons from the local vibrational modes of the molecules on the surface @xcite and would offer exciting possibilities to image the interference and interactions between inelastic scattering processes in the ensemble of few scattering centers . in practice the tunneling conductance in real materials will likely have peaks in @xmath10 as a function of position due to band structure .",
    "one would need to be able to separate these peaks from the peaks that arise due to inelastic scattering .",
