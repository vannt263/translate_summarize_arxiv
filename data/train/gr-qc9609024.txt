    "the last stage of coalescing binary neutron stars(bns s ) is one of the most promising sources for kilometer size interferometric gravitational wave detectors , ligo@xcite and virgo@xcite .",
    "when the orbital separation of bns s becomes @xmath1 km as a result of the emission of gravitational waves , it is observed that the frequency of gravitational waves from them becomes @xmath2hz .",
    "after then , the orbit of bns s shrinks owing to the radiation reaction toward merging in a few minutes@xcite . in such a phase ,",
    "bns s are the strongly self - gravitating bound systems , and gravitational waves from them will have various general relativistic(gr ) imformations .",
    "in particular , in the last few milliseconds before merging , bns s are in a very strong gr gravitational field because the orbital separation is less than ten times of the schwarzschild radius of the system .",
    "thus , if we could detect the signal of gravitational waves radiated in the last few milliseconds , we would be able to observe directly the phenomena in the gr gravitational field .    to interpret the implication of the signal of gravitational waves",
    ", we need to understand the theoretical mechanism of merging in detail .",
    "the little knowledge we have about the very last phase of bns s is as follows : when the orbital separation of bns s is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the total mass of bns s , they move approximately in circular orbits because the timescale of the energy loss due to gravitational radiation @xmath5 is much longer than the orbital period @xmath6 as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the reduced mass and the separation of bns s .",
    "thus , bns s adiabatically evolve radiating gravitational waves",
    ". however , when the orbital separation becomes @xmath10 , they can not maintain the circular orbit because of instabilities due to the gr gravity@xcite or the tidal field@xcite . as a result of such instabilities , the circular orbit of bns s changes into the plunging orbit to merge .",
    "this means that the nature of the signal of gravitational waves changes around the transition between the circular orbit and plunging one .",
    "gravitational waves emitted at this transition region may bring us an important information about the structure of ns s because the location where the instability occurs will depend on the equation of state(eos ) of ns sensitively@xcite .",
    "thus , it is very important to investigate the location of the innermost stable circular orbit(isco ) of bns s .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the isco is determined not only by the gr effects , but also by the hydrodynamic one .",
    "we emphasize that the tidal effects depend strongly on the structure of ns . here",
    ", ns is a gr object because of its compactness , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the mass and radius of ns .",
    "thus , in order to know the location of the isco accurately , we need to solve the gr hydrodynamic equations in general . a strategy to search",
    "the isco in gr manner is as follows ; since the timescale of the energy loss is much longer than the orbital period according to eq.@xmath14 , we may suppose that the motion of bns s is composed of the stationary part and the small radiation reaction part .",
    "from this physical point of view , we may consider that bns s evolve quasi - stationally , and we can take the following procedure ; first , neglecting the evolution due to gravitational radiation , equilibrium configurations are constructed , and then the radiation reaction is taken into account as a correction to the equilibrium configurations .",
    "the isco is determined from the point , where the dynamical instability for the equilibrium configurations occurs .",
    "it may be a grand challenge , however , to distinguish the stationary part from the nonstationary one in general relativity .",
    "as detweiler has pointed out@xcite , a stationary solution of the einstein equation with standing gravitational waves , which will be constructed by adding the incoming waves from infinity , may be a valuable approximation to physically realistic solutions .",
    "however , these solutions are not asymptotically flat@xcite because gws contribute to the total energy of the system and the total energy of gws inside a radius @xmath15 grows linearly with @xmath15 .",
    "the lack of asymptotic flatness forces us to consider only a bounded space and impose boundary conditions in the near zone .",
    "careful consideration will be necessary to find out an appropriate boundary condition for describing the physically realistic system in the near zone .",
    "recently , wilson and his collaborators@xcite proposed a simirelativistic approximation method in order to calculate the equilibrium configuration of bns s just before merging . in their method , they assume the line element as @xmath16 i.e. , three metric @xmath17 is chosen as the conformal flat(i.e . , @xmath18 ) , and solve only the constraint equations in the einstein equation . in their approach , they claim that they ignore only the contribution of gravitational waves , but it is not correct at all ; as shown in previous post - newtonian(pn ) analyses@xcite , the tensor potential term exists in the three metric even if we ignore the radiation reaction of gravitational waves(i.e . , @xmath19 ) .",
    "since such a term appears from the second pn order in the pn approximation , the accuracy of their results is less than the 2pn order : in reality , from results by cook et al.@xcite in which they obtain equilibrium configurations of the axisymmetric ns using both the einstein equation and wilson s method , we can see that some quantities obtained from wilson s scheme , such as the lapse function , the three metric , the angular velocity , and so on , deviate from the exact solution by about @xmath20 .",
    "this seems to indicate that their approach for the system of bns s is valid only at the 1pn level from the pn point of view .",
    "furthermore , the meaning of their approximation is obscure : it is not clear at all how to estimate errors due to such an approximation scheme and in which situation but the spherical symmetric system , the scheme based on the assumption of the conformal flatness is justified .",
    "in contrast with wilson s method , the meaning of the pn approximation is fairly clear : in the pn approximation , the metric is formally expanded with respect to @xmath21 assuming the slow motion and weak self - gravity of matter .",
    "if we will take into account the next pn order , the accuracy of approximate solutions will be improved .",
    "this means that we can estimate the order of magnitude of the error due to the ignorance of higher pn terms .",
    "also , in the pn approximation , we can distinguish the radiation reaction terms , which begin at the 2.5pn order@xcite , from other terms in the metric .",
    "thus , it is possible to construct the equilibrium configuration of bns s without the radiation reaction terms in the 2pn approximation .",
    "we schematically describe two approaches in tables 1(a ) and 1(b ) . as mentioned above , in close binary of ns s",
    ", it is important to take into account gr effects to orbital motion as well as to the internal structure of each ns . as for the orbital motion ,",
    "there exist two parameters ; one is the pn parameter @xmath22 and the other is the mass ratio @xmath23 of the reduced mass @xmath8 to the total mass @xmath4 , and both parameters are less than unity .",
    "thus , the physical quantities such as the orbital frequency are expanded with respect to them . in table 1(a ) , we show schematically various levels of approximations in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if all terms in a level are taken into account in the 2pn approximation , we mark @xmath24 , while @xmath25 means that all terms in the marked level are taken into account in wilson s approach . from table 1(a ) , we see that the 2pn approximation can include all corrections in @xmath23 up to the 2pn order in contrast with wilson s approach . on the other hand",
    ", wilson s approach will hold completely in the test particle limit , i.e. , at @xmath26 , whereas even in this limit the 2pn approximation is not valid at higher pn orders .",
    "as for the internal structure of each ns , there also exist two small parameters ; one is the compactness @xmath27 and the other is the deformation parameter from its spherical shape , such as an ellipticity @xmath28 . in this case , the pn approximation becomes an expansion in terms of @xmath27 . in table 1(b ) , we also show various levels of approximation in terms of these parameters .",
    "although wilson s approach is exact for spherical ns s , it is not valid in nonspherical cases even at the 2pn order . on the other hand , in the 2pn approximation",
    ", the spherical compact star can not be obtained correctly in contrast with wilson s approach . in this way , the 2pn approximation has a week point : although it can take into account all effects up to the 2pn order , it is inferior to wilson s approach when we take a test - particle limit , @xmath29 , or we describe an exactly spherical ns .",
    "however , as shown below , the error due to the ignorance of higher pn terms in those cases is not so large .    to estimate the error due to the ignorance of the higher pn terms ,",
    "let us compare the gr exact solutions with their pn approximations .",
    "first , we consider a small star of mass @xmath8 orbiting a schwarzschild black hole of mass @xmath30 . in this case",
    ", we may consider that the small star moves on the geodesic around the schwarzschild black hole , and the orbital angular velocity becomes@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the coordinate radius of the orbit in the harmonic coordinate . in the pn approximation",
    ", eq.@xmath33 becomes @xmath34 comparing eq.@xmath33 with eq.@xmath35 , it is found that the error size of the 2pn angular velocity is @xmath36 at @xmath37 , and @xmath38 at @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the 2pn approximation seems fairly good to describe the motion of relativistic binary stars just before coalescence .",
    "next , we consider a spherical ns of a uniform density in order to investigate the applicability of the pn approximation for determination of the internal structure of ns s . in this model , the pressure , @xmath6 , and the density , @xmath40const . , are related with each other@xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coordinate radius in the schwarzschild coordinate and terms of order @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote newtonian , 1pn and 2pn terms respectively . in the second line in eq.@xmath46 , we expand the equation in power of @xmath27 regarding it as a small quantity .",
    "in fig.1 , we shows the error , @xmath47 , in newtonian , 1pn and 2pn cases as a function of @xmath42 for @xmath48(solid lines ) and @xmath49(dotted lines ) , where @xmath50 denotes the pn approximate pressure .",
    "it is found that the discrepancy in the newtonian treatment is very large , while in the 2pn approximation the error is less than 10@xmath51 . in this way",
    ", we can estimate rigidly the typical error size in the 2pn approximation .",
    "furthermore , the accuracy is fairly good if the ns is not extremely compact ; the 2pn approximation will be fairly accurate if the radius of ns is larger than @xmath5210 km .",
    "thus , in the present paper , we develop a formalism to obtain equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating fluid in the 2pn order as a first step . in section 2 , we review the basic equations up to the 2pn order . in section 3 ,",
    "we rewrite the poisson equation for potential functions , which are described in section 2 , into useful forms in which the source terms of the poisson equations decrease rapidly enough(@xmath0 ) . in section 4",
    ", we show a formulation to obtain numerically equilibrium solutions of uniformly rotating fluid in the 2pn approximation : taking into account the formulation in the first pn approximation@xcite , we further rewrite potentials defined in section 3 into a polynomial form in the angular velocity , @xmath53 . then , we transform the integrated euler equation into the polynomial form in @xmath54 so that the convergence property in iteration procedures may be much improved . for the sake of analysis for numerical results ,",
    "we describe the 2pn expression of the conserved quantities , such as the conserved mass , the adm mass , the total energy and the total angular momentum in section 5 .",
    "section 6 is devoted to summary . throughout this paper ,",
    "@xmath55 and @xmath56 denote the gravitational constant and the speed of light .",
    "hereafter , we use units of @xmath57 .",
    "substituting pn expansions of metric and matter variables into the einstein equation , and using the polytropic eos , we find that the metric variables obey the following poisson equations@xcite ; @xmath79 - 4u_{,j } \\bigl(\\three\\beta_{i , j}+\\three\\beta_{j , i } -{2 \\over 3}\\delta_{ij}\\three\\beta_{k , k}\\bigr ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\hskip 2 cm } -2\\four\\dot\\psi_{,i }        + { 1 \\over 2}(u \\dot u)_{,i}+(\\three\\beta_l u_{,l})_{,i } , \\\\ & & \\delta   h_{ij}=\\bigl(u u_{,ij}-{1 \\over 3}\\delta_{ij}u \\delta_{flat}u -3u_{,i } u_{,j}+\\delta_{ij}u_{,k } u_{,k } \\bigr ) -16\\pi \\bigl(\\rho v^i v^j -{1 \\over 3}\\delta_{ij}\\rho v^2 \\bigr ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\hskip 1 cm   -\\bigl(\\three\\dot\\beta_{i , j}+\\three\\dot\\beta_{j , i } -{2 \\over 3}\\delta_{ij}\\three\\dot\\beta_{k , k } \\bigr )   -2\\bigl ( ( x+2\\four\\psi)_{,ij}-{1 \\over 3}\\delta_{ij } \\delta ( x+2\\four\\psi ) \\bigr ) , \\\\ & & \\delta \\six\\alpha=4\\pi\\rho\\biggl[2v^4 + 2v^2\\bigl(5u+\\gamma\\varepsilon\\bigr)+(3\\gamma-2)\\varepsilon u + 4\\four\\psi+x+4\\three\\beta_i v^i \\biggr ] \\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\hskip 3cm}-h_{ij}u_{,ij } -{3 \\over 2}u u_{,l}u_{,l}+u_{,l}(2 \\four\\psi -x)_{,l } \\nonumber\\\\ & & { \\hskip 3 cm } + { 1 \\over 2 } \\three\\beta_{i , j}\\bigl(\\three\\beta_{i , j}+\\three\\beta_{j , i } -{2 \\over 3}\\delta_{ij}\\three\\beta_{k , k}\\bigr ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the flat laplacian , and @xmath81 denotes @xmath82 .    equations of motion for fluid are derived from @xmath83 in this paper , we consider the uniformly rotating fluid around @xmath84-axis with the angular velocity @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath85 where we choose @xmath86 and @xmath87 is the completely anti - symmetric unit tensor . in this case , the following relations hold ; @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are arbitrary scalars , vectors , and tensors , respectively .",

    "in section 2 , we derive the poisson equations for metric variables . however , the source terms in the poisson equations for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 fall off slowly as @xmath108 because these terms behave as @xmath109 at @xmath108 .",

    "motivated by this idea , in this paper , we have developed a formalism to obtain equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating fluid up to the 2pn order using the pn approximation .",
    "the concept of being `` almost '' stationary becomes clear in the framework of the pn approximation and , in particular , the stationary rotating objects can exist exactly at the 2pn order , since the energy loss due to the gravitational radiation does occur from the 2.5pn order .",
    "there appear , at the 2pn order , tensor potentials @xmath107 which were completely ignored in wilson s approach@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that these tensor potentials play an important role at the 2pn order : this is because they appear in the equations to determine equilibrium configurations as shown in previous sections and they also contribute to the total energy and angular momentum of systems .",
    "this means that if we performed the stability analysis ignoring the tensor potentials , we might reach an incorrect conclusion .    in our formalism",
    ", we extract terms depending on the angular velocity @xmath53 from the integrated euler equation and poisson equations for potentials , and rewrite the integrated euler equation as an explicit equation in @xmath53 .",
    "this reduction will improve the convergence in numerical iteration procedure . as a result",
    ", the number of poisson equations we need to solve in each step of iteration reaches 29 .",
    "however , source terms of the poisson equations decrease rapidly enough , at worst @xmath0 , in the region far from the source , so that we can solve accurately these equations as the boundary value problem like in the case of the first pn calculations@xcite .",
    "thus , the present formalism will be useful to obtain equilibrium configurations for synchronized bns s or the jacobi ellipsoid .",
