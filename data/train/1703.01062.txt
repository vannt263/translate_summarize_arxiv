    "as a new way to power mobile devices , there has been a growing interest in harvesting energy from the far - field radio - frequency ( rf ) signal transmissions . in particular , design of wireless - powered communication network ( wpcn ) has been studied as a significant application of rf energy harvesting , where remote user equipments ( ues ) utilize the energy harvested from wireless rf transfer of power for wireless communications .",
    "one typical wpcn model has been proposed in @xcite , in which wireless energy transfer ( wet ) in the downlink ( dl ) and wireless information transmissions ( wit ) in the uplink ( ul ) are both coordinated by a hybrid access - point ( h - ap ) . in wpcns where the h - ap and ues all operate in half duplex ( hd ) , termed as hd - wpcns , a fundamental trade - off exists in allocations of resources to dl for wet and ul for wit @xcite , because allocating more resources to dl for wet increases transmit power of ues in the ul thanks to the increase in the amount of harvested energy , but also decreases resources allocated to ul for wit .",
    "meanwhile , full duplex ( fd ) based wireless systems have a great deal of attention , in which the wireless nodes transmit and receive rf signals at the same time and in the same frequency band .",
    "fd operation is expected to potentially double the spectral efficiency in wireless communications by cancelling the leakage of transmitted signal received by itself , i.e. , self - interference ( si ) . in particular , feasibility of the fd communication",
    "has been verified by proof - of - concept ( poc ) , by showing that the power of residual si after self - interference cancellation ( sic ) is reduced close enough to the power of background noise @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous transmission and reception led by fd operation can also be utilized to improve throughput of wpcn . in @xcite ,",
    "one wpcn model in which an h - ap with fd operation coordinates wet to and wit from a set of ues operating in half - duplex ( hd ) , denoted by fd - wpcn with hd ues ( fd - wpcn - hd ) , has been proposed .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that fd operation of the h - ap in the fd - wpcn - hd is able to increase throughput of wpcn when si is sufficiently cancelled at the h - ap . in @xcite ,",
    "kang et al . have studied resource allocation in fd - wpcn - hd with energy causality constraint , i.e. , the constraint that signal transmission of a ue at a given time can utilize only the harvested energy which is harvested during the previous time . in addition , fd - wpcn - hd with orthogonal frequency - division multiplexing ( ofdm ) modulation has been studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "finally , wireless powered relay network has been investigated , in which an fd relay that utilizes si as an energy source relays information of an hd source to an hd destination .    in this paper , we study another type of wpcn in which not only the h - ap but also ues operate in fd , denoted by fd - wpcn with fd ues ( fd - wpcn - fd ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_systemmodel ] .",
    "thanks to the fd capability , ues can receive the signal sent by the h - ap to carry energy while transmitting their respective ul information .",
    "we first propose transceiver structure for ues that enables simultaneous energy reception in the dl and information transmission in the ul . by extending our previous work in @xcite ,",
    "we characterize energy usage in the proposed ue transceiver accounting for energy leakage from transmit chain to receive chain , and show that ues can also harvest energy from the leakage of their own ul transmissions ( i.e. , si ) as well as the received signal sent by the h - ap in the dl . based on a time - division - multiple - access ( tdma ) protocol for information transmissions in the ul ,",
    "finally , the optimal time allocation to maximize the weighted sum - throughput in the network is studied , subject to a given total time constraint .",
    "fig . [ fig_systemmodel ] shows a fd - wpcn - fd model considered in this paper .",
    "this network consists of one h - ap and @xmath0 ues ( denoted by @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , all of which are equipped with a single - antenna fd transceiver to transmit and receive signal over the same frequency band simultaneously .    the h - ap transfers energy to ues in the dl by broadcasting a signal dedicated to carry energy .",
    "at the same time , the h - ap also receives signals transmitted by ues in the ul , which contains information to decode . fd operation of the h - ap enables to simultaneously transmit / receive energy / information signals in the dl / ul , respectively . for decoding information received in the ul ,",
    "an si canceller is deployed at the fd transceiver of the h - ap to eliminate si ( i.e. , the leakage of dl energy signal transmission received by itself ) , which interferes with reception of ul information signals .        on the other hand , ues harvest energy from the received signals and charges their respective battery .",
    "a part of charged energy is used to transmit information in the ul .",
    "thanks to fd operation , ues are also capable of simultaneously transmitting / receiving information / energy signals in the ul / dl , respectively .",
    "this is enabled by the transceiver shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_ue_transceiver ] .",
    "note that the energy signal broadcast by the h - ap in the dl does not carry any information to decode but energy only .",
    "therefore , neither information decoder nor si canceller is deployed at the receiving end of a ue s transceiver . at the receiving end , instead",
    ", an energy harvester ( e.g. rectifier ) is installed to harvest energy from the received signals .",
    "it is worth noting that in this transceiver , a part of power amplifier ( pa ) output energy at the transmitting end leaks into the receiving end as si , while the remaining part of pa output energy is used to transmit information to the h - ap . at the @xmath3th user @xmath1 , as shown in fig .",
