    "for many years investigations of the small @xmath5 dynamics were focused on studies of the @xmath6 interactions ar hera . in particular , over the last decade significant efforts were aimed on the theoretical and experimental investigations of the high energy diffractive photo / electro production of vector mesons off proton target ( for the recent review and references see @xcite ) including the hard processes in which a vector meson is produced with a large rapidity gap , @xmath7 , between the vector meson @xmath8 and the produced hadronic system @xmath9 : @xmath10 an important feature of these processes which occur due to the elastic scattering of small color singlet quark - antiquark ( @xmath11 ) dipole configurations in the photon wave function ( referred to as dipoles in the remainder of this article ) off a parton within the proton target is the nontrivial interplay between evolution in @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "study of high energy vector meson photoproduction in kinematics where momentum transferred through the gluon ladder exchange between dipole and a parton is large and the produced vector meson is separated by large rapidity gap from the products of target dissociation should allow to investigate @xmath14 evolution at fixed momentum transfer @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the hera measured the relevant cross sections of @xmath16 and @xmath0 photoproduction @xcite in a rather restricted @xmath3 center - of - mass range @xmath17 gev and very limited range of @xmath7 , making it very difficult to study the energy dependence of the amplitude predicted by the bfkl dynamics .",
    "hence , it would clearly be beneficial to perform such measurements at higher @xmath18 and over a much larger range of @xmath7 .",
    "here we extend our feasibility studies of @xcite , @xcite for probing these processes in the proton - nucleus ultraperipheral collisions ( upcs)@xcite at the lhc .",
    "the cms and atlas detectors are well suited for such investigations since they cover large rapidity intervals .",
    "the alice detector maybe capable of studying this process in a certain rapidity range as well .",
    "we consider @xmath0 photoproduction by photon from the ultrarelativistic ion on the proton target in ultraperipheral @xmath19 collisions , @xmath20 in the kinematics with large @xmath15 and the rapidity gap @xmath21 between @xmath0 and the produced hadronic system @xmath9 which is sufficiently large to suppress the fragmentation contribution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ formula ]",
    "we discuss the qcd motivated formulas and parametrizations which could be used to describe the energy and @xmath15 dependence of the considered process .",
    "section [ hera ] is devoted to analysis of the available hera data on @xmath0 production using parametrization of the data which is based on the hard mechanism of the reaction . in section [ rates ]",
    "we estimate the rates of @xmath22 reaction in @xmath23 collisions at lhc .",
    "the main variables in such processes are the mass of the system produced in the proton dissociation , @xmath24 , the square of momentum transfer @xmath25 , and the square of the @xmath11-parton elastic scattering energy @xmath26 here @xmath27 denotes gluon or quark in the target and @xmath28 is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the target parton for a given @xmath24 and @xmath15 . at large @xmath15 and @xmath18 ,",
    "the gap between the rapidity of the produced vector meson and the final - state parton at the leading edge of the rapidity range of the hadronic system @xmath9 is @xmath29 it is rather difficult to measure @xmath24 or @xmath5 directly .",
    "however , they can be adequately determined by studying the leading hadrons close to the rapidity gap ; full reconstruction is not required .    in kinematical region of large @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath31 the quarkonium photoproduction cross section with target proton dissociation can be described as an incoherent sum of terms which are proportional to the product of the large @xmath15 cross section of quarkonium photoproduction off the parton and the density of the parton @xmath27 in the target @xcite : @xmath32 \\biggr ] \\ , \\ , .",

    "is dominated by transition of the photon into the small @xmath38 dipole configuration which scatters elastically off the target parton and transforms into the vector meson .",
    "the dipole - gluon elastic scattering cross section is enhanced by a factor 81/16 relative to the scattering off quark .",
    "large @xmath15 ensures important simplifications .",
    "the parton ladder mediating elastic scattering of dipole is attached via two gluons to one target parton while the attachment to two and more partons in the target is strongly suppressed . since @xmath15 is the same on all rungs of the ladder , the amplitude @xmath39 probes evolution in @xmath40 at fixed @xmath15 @xcite . because the momentum transfer is shared between two gluons , the characteristic virtuality of @xmath15-channel gluons on the ladder",
    "is @xmath41 while the hard scale in the target parton density is @xmath42 .    to",
    "the lowest order in @xmath40 , the amplitude , @xmath39 , is independent of @xmath18 for fixed @xmath15 .",
    "higher order terms in @xmath43 accounted for in the leading and next - to - leading log approximations will result in increase of @xmath44 with energy as a power of @xmath45 @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "the value @xmath48 changes significantly between lo and nlo bfkl , @xmath49 at lo and @xmath50 at nlo .",
    "the resummed bfkl gives a value of @xmath51 @xcite over a wide range of @xmath52 . in the perturbative qcd",
    "the slope parameter @xmath53 should be negligible ( @xmath54 ) in the @xmath55 limit . since kinematics of hera measurements",
    "is restricted by the interval @xmath56 we keep this parameter to reveal sensitivity of the process to its value .",
    "experimental information about @xmath57 in hard processes can be extracted , in principle , from the study of the exclusive electroproduction of light vector mesons or photo and electroproduction of heavy quarkonia .",
    "the current @xmath0 data leads to @xmath58 for a rather wide range of @xmath59 .",
    "the data on the @xmath15 dependence of @xmath60 in electroproduction processes at @xmath61 are consistent with @xmath15 independent @xmath62 , though the error bars are significantly larger in this case , for the recent results see @xcite .",
    "therefore a natural guess for the value of @xmath63 in the hard regime is @xmath64 for the @xmath15 interval @xmath56 . in view of the theoretical uncertainties described above we will treat @xmath48 and @xmath53 as the free parameters but generally assume that @xmath60 weakly depends on @xmath15 .",
    "the @xmath15-dependence of @xmath65 originates both from the square of the energy dependent part of elastic parton - parton scattering amplitude as given by eq .",
    "[ dipamp ] and from the t - dependence of the attachments of the ladder to vector meson and parton of the target , @xmath66 .",
    "the large @xmath67 behavior of the non - spin flip photoproduction cross section is @xmath68 .",
    "the spin- flip contribution leads to @xmath69 with strong sensitivity to the form of a vector meson - photon coupling .",
    "the hera data on @xmath0 photoproduction @xcite indicate that the spin flip contribution remains a small correction in the whole studied range of t. hence we will neglect it in the following .    the important feature of the large rapidity gap @xmath0 photoproduction in a wide range of @xmath15",
    ", starting from @xmath70 few gev@xmath71 , is that the essential virtualities in the attachments of the ladder to the @xmath72 vertex and to the parton of the target are different . in the @xmath72 coupling all virtualities are at least of the order @xmath73",
    "this was first observed in @xcite where the process of @xmath0 production was considered in the leading log bfkl approximation .",
    "actually , this feature of the process is more general and follows from the gauge invariance",
    ". the t - dependence in the ladder -target parton block should be similar to that in deep inelastic scattering off the corresponding parton of the target - two gluons attached to this parton in the amplitude have large relative momenta and effectively act as one point - like probe of virtuality @xmath15 . experimentally scaling in dis sets in at @xmath74 .",
    "hence , to describe the @xmath15-dependence in the @xmath0 photoproduction we need in principle two scale parameters - one close to the square of the mass of @xmath0 and another , @xmath75 , of the same order as the scale of onset of scaling in dis .",
    "the experimental cuts in the rapidity gap @xmath0 photoproduction hera data ( @xcite , @xcite ) resulted in the relatively small rapidity interval available for gluon emission in the color singlet ladder , @xmath76 . really , in most of the probed settings the invariant energy of the dipole - parton system was rather low , @xmath77 .",
    "since only single gluon emission is allowed for such energies in the ladder kinematics , it is hardly justified to apply a bfkl - type approximation .",
    "hence , we need some reasonable qcd motivated parametrization of the cross section based on eq.[dglapbfkl ]",
    ". it should account for the discussed above two scales characterizing onset of hard processes in the large rapidity gap @xmath0 photoproduction and should be applicable in a wide region of @xmath15 , not only to asymptotically large @xmath15 .",

    "the value of @xmath81 was calculated using eq.([xmin ] ) separately for each of experimental sets of the zeus and h1 data using reported cuts on @xmath24 .",
    "the values of @xmath48 , @xmath82 in @xmath83 and constant @xmath84 were adjusted to provide a reasonable description of the @xmath0 photoproduction at hera .    there are exists two sets of the large @xmath15 and rapidity gap @xmath0 data .",
    "collaboration zeus @xcite measured the t - dependence of cross section in the range @xmath85 at the average energy @xmath86 using the following cuts : @xmath87 with @xmath88 if @xmath89 otherwise @xmath90 . in the experiment of h1 collaboration @xcite",
    "the t - dependence has been measured in the wider interval @xmath91 averaging the cross section over the energy in the range @xmath92 and assigning the averaged cross section to the value @xmath93 .",
    "the restriction on the mass of the produced system @xmath24 , @xmath94 , applied in h1 experiment leads to the energy dependent value of @xmath81 .",
    "this means that the cross section has to be integrated over x in the interval @xmath95 before averaging over energy at each value of @xmath15 .",
    "we find that these data are consistent ( fig.[h1psit ] ) with @xmath15 dependence predicted by qcd dominance of one gluon exchange in the charmonium wave function ( @xmath96 ) and the shape of the curve is not sensitive to the parameter @xmath48 which characterizes explicit energy dependence of the amplitude of dipole scattering off a constituent of the target .",
    "the @xmath15 dependence of cross section is described reasonably well with the values : @xmath97 if @xmath98 , @xmath99 if the parameter @xmath100 and @xmath101 for @xmath102 at not too large values of @xmath15 . since the parameter @xmath48 is appeared to be comparatively small it is evident that there is definite sensitivity to the slope parameter @xmath82 at large @xmath15 . from comparison with the data the value @xmath103 gev@xmath71 seems to be reasonable .",
    "the h1 collaboration also presented the data for the energy dependence of cross section for three intervals of @xmath15 . in this kinematics dependence of cross section on @xmath18",
    "is determined by the factor @xmath104 in the cross section of dipole - parton interaction and by integral over @xmath5 of weighed by factor @xmath105 the parton distributions within the proton . with an increase of the energy the value of @xmath81 is decreasing and due to the strong growth of the gluon distributions in the proton the integral over @xmath5 rapidly grows . from comparison of the results of calculations with the data we found that in the kinematics covered by hera , i. e. with the energy dependent cut on the mass @xmath24 of the produced system , increase of cross section with energy is due to the growth of @xmath106 related to the increase of the gluon distributions rather than due to the factor @xmath107 .",
    "so , we conclude that the kinematical cut imposed in the h1 experiment results in a weak sensitivity of the data to actual value of @xmath60 , see fig.[h1psiw ]",
    ".    one can achieve a better sensitivity to @xmath48 if the cross section were studied as a function of energy at fixed @xmath24 ( fixed @xmath5 ) or for @xmath108 . in the latter case",
    "the integral of parton distribution over @xmath5 is constant and the energy dependence follows from the amplitude of dipole - parton interaction . for the illustration we present in fig.[h1psiwfix ] results of the calculations for such @xmath24 cut in the kinematics of h1 .",
    "thus our analysis shows that h1 and zeus data on large t large rapidity gap processes are consistent with the @xmath15-dependence expected in pqcd which is a combination of @xmath15-dependence due to the structure of the @xmath109 vector meson wave function and the t - dependence of the amplitude of dipole - parton scattering . at the same time data",
    "are insensitive to the energy dependence of the amplitude of dipole - parton scattering which can not be reduced to parton distributions in a hadron . to probe pqcd predictions for this amplitude one need to perform measurements in different kinematics and at significantly larger collision energies which can be achieved in ultraperipheral collisions at lhc .",
    "it is unlikely that further hera studies will cover a sufficiently wide range of @xmath18 and @xmath7 to study the energy dependence of the large-@xmath15 elastic dipole - parton scattering amplitude . on the other hand , at the lhc , cms and atlas will have sufficient rapidity coverage to study the process in eq .",
    "( [ eqvm ] ) in ultraperipheral @xmath19 collisions . to estimate the large @xmath15 rapidity gap @xmath0 photoproduction cross section in ultraperipheral @xmath19 collisions at the lhc we use the parametrization of the @xmath110 cross section in eqs .",
    "( [ gjpsi ] ) .",
    "@xmath111 we do not address the @xmath19 contribution from @xmath112 since it is much smaller and can easily be separated experimentally .",
    "the large @xmath15 nucleon - dissociation cross section is then @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the photon flux generated by the ion with energy @xmath115 .",
    "we consider intermediate and large momentum transfer in upcs at the lhc , analogous to those studied at hera .    to check feasibility of such measurements and their sensitivity to the value of @xmath62 we performed calculations of the cross sections of rapidity gap events with @xmath116 in ultraperipheral proton - ion collisions at lhc for the interval of the @xmath0 rapidities @xmath117 which corresponds to the range of energies @xmath18 from about 40 gev up to 1 tev .",
    "results are also shown for two assumptions of @xmath48 : 0.2 and 0.1 .",
    "we do not consider @xmath118 gev where our hera - based parametrization , eqs .",
    "( [ gjpsi ] ) and ( [ intx ] ) , is unreliable .",
    "we study the cross section when @xmath119 , specifically @xmath120 at fixed @xmath15 , fig.[pbpfixt](left ) .",
    "this cut corresponds to fixing @xmath7 and changing @xmath121 .",
    "such studies could test the parton distribution functions and the reaction mechanism by extracting @xmath106 from the data in different @xmath121 and @xmath15 bins .",
    "the cross section can also be studied at fixed @xmath15 as a function of the vector meson rapidity with the restriction @xmath122 to determine the energy dependence of the dipole - parton amplitude and thus @xmath60 . in this case , @xmath121 does not depend on @xmath18 and the dipole - parton elastic scattering amplitude varies with @xmath18 due to the increase of the rapidity gap with @xmath123 .",
    "most events in the kinematics with @xmath124 gev and @xmath125 correspond to @xmath126 where the scattering of dipole off the gluons of the target give the dominant contribution . because of the specifics of the lhc detectors it will be probably very difficult to reach the @xmath5 range where quark scattering is larger than gluon scattering , @xmath127",
    ". thus we can primarily infer the energy dependence of the elastic @xmath128-gluon amplitude at different @xmath15 .",
    "overall , the energy range , @xmath129 , is large enough for precision measurements of the energy dependence of the amplitude .",
    "if @xmath130 , the elastic cross section should increase by a factor of @xmath131 in the energy range .",
    "the two choices of @xmath24 cut exhibit the same behavior at large forward rapidity due to the steep decrease of the photon flux .",
    "the cross section integrated over @xmath15 in the range @xmath132 are presented in figs.[pbppsiw ] .",
    "the total cross sections integrated over the interval of rapidities @xmath117 for two considered cuts on the mass of produced system @xmath24 are given in table [ tcs ] .",
    "the rates , which can be obtained multiplying the cross sections by luminosities of 6 and 0.4 @xmath133b@xmath134 for @xmath135ar and @xmath135pb respectively , are high ( even when one takes into account a small decay branching ratio of @xmath0 into leptons which is not included in the table )    .total cross sections of the large rapidity gap @xmath0 photoproduction in ultraperipheral p - ar and p - pb collisions . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     one can see that cross sections are large in the rapidity range where the lhc detectors have good acceptance to @xmath0 s with transverse momenta of few gev and that with the cuts natural for lhc there is a strong sensitivity to the value of the @xmath62 parameter .",
    "hence we conclude that measurements of the discussed processes in pa collisions at lhc would allow to measure energy and momentum transfer dependence of the hard vacuum exchange .",
    "studies of rapidity gap processes in the proton - ion upcs at the lhc will directly measure the energy dependence of the large-@xmath15 elastic amplitude of dipole - parton scattering in the wide range of energies .",
    "we find that it will be possible to study the @xmath0 photoproduction in such processes up to @xmath136 tev , extending the energy range studied at hera by a factor of 10 .",
    "this should allow us to investigate hard qcd dynamics up to @xmath137 that corresponds to rapidity interval of @xmath138 units for gluon emission .",
    "the rapidity interval between two gluons on the ladder is @xmath139 , hence , the emission of several gluons is possible in the ladder in such processes thus making applicability of the bfkl approach more justified",
    ". these measurements will be also important as a reference for the study of a similar process in the nucleus - nucleus collisions at the lhc which will be considered in a separate publication ( for discussion of the analogous process of large t @xmath16-meson production in the nucleus - nucleus collisions see @xcite ) .",
