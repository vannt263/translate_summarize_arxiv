    "game theory is the mathematical study of interaction among independent , self interested agents .",
    "it emerged from the work of von neumann @xcite , and is now used in various disciplines like economics , biology , medical sciences , social sciences and physics @xcite .",
    "due to dramatic development in quantum information theory @xcite , the game theorists [ @xmath0-@xmath1 have made strenuous efforts to extend the classical game theory into the quantum domain .",
    "the first attempt in this direction was made by meyer @xcite by quantizing a simple coin tossing game .",
    "applications of quantum games are reviewed by several authors [ @xmath2-@xmath3 .",
    "a formulation of quantum game theory based on the schmidt decomposition is presented by ichikawa et al .",
    "recently , xia et al .",
    "xia1,xia2 have investigated the quantum stackelberg duopoly game under the influence of decoherence and have found a critical point for the maximally entangled initial state against the damping parameter for the amplitude damping environment under certain conditions .    in practice",
    "no system can be fully isolated from its environment .",
    "the interaction between system and environment leads to the destruction of quantum coherence of the system .",
    "it produces an inevitable noise and results in the loss of information encoded in the system @xcite .",
    "this gives rise to the phenomenon of decoherence .",
    "quantum information are encoded in qubits during its transmission from one party to another and require communication channels . in a realistic situation ,",
    "the qubits have a nontrivial dynamics during transmission because of their interaction with the environment .",
    "therefore , a party may receive a set of distorted qubits because of the disturbing action of the channel .",
    "studies on quantum channels have attracted a lot of attention in recent past @xcite .",
    "early work in this direction was devoted mainly to memoryless channels for which consecutive signal transmissions through the channel were not correlated . in the correlated channels ( i.e. the channels with memory ) ,",
    "the noise acts on consecutive uses of the channel .",
    "the effect of decoherence and correlated noise in quantum games have produced interesting results and is studied by number of authors  [ @xmath4-@xmath5 .    in this paper , we study the effect of correlated noise introduced through amplitude damping , phase damping and depolarizing channels parameterized by the decoherence parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the memory parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 , on the quantum stackelberg duopoly game .",
    "the decoherence parameters @xmath10 and the memory parameters @xmath11 range from @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "the lower and upper limits of decoherence parameter @xmath10  correspond to the undecohered and fully decohered cases , respectively . whereas the lower and upper limits of memory parameter @xmath11correspond to the uncorrelated and fully correlated cases , respectively .",
    "it is seen that there exists a critical point in the case of amplitude damping channel for initially unentangled state * *  * * at which both firms have equal payoffs .",
    "the game transforms from leader advantage to the follower advantage game beyond this point , for highly decohered case in the presence of memory . for initially entangled state under the influence of amplitude damping channel we found two critical points .",
    "the game behaves as a follower advantage game within these two critical points . in the case of depolarizing channel",
    "the high correlation results in high payoffs .",
    "however , phase damping channel has no effect on the game dynamics .",
    "stackelberg duopoly is a market game , which is rather different from the cournot duopoly game . in cournot duopoly game ,",
    "two firms simultaneously provide a homogeneous product to the market and guess that what action the opponent will take .",
    "however stackelberg duopoly is a dynamic model of duopoly game in which one firm , say firm @xmath14 moves first and the other firm , say @xmath15 , goes after . before making its decision ,",
    "firm @xmath15 observes the move of firm @xmath14 .",
    "this transforms the static nature of cournot duopoly game to a dynamic one .",
    "firm @xmath14 is usually called the leader and firm @xmath15 the follower , on this basis the game is also called the leader - follower model @xcite . in classical stackelberg duopoly",
    "it is assumed that firm @xmath15 will respond optimally to the strategic decision of firm @xmath14 .",
    "as firm @xmath14 can precisely predict firm @xmath15 s strategic decision , firm @xmath14 chooses its move in such a way that maximizes its own payoff .",
    "this informational asymmetry makes the stackelberg duopoly as the first mover advantage game .",
    "a number of authors have proposed various quantization protocols for observing the behavior of stackelberg duopoly game in the quantum realm [ 9,29 - 32 ] .",
    "it has been shown that quantum entanglement affects payoff of the first mover and produces an equilibrium that corresponds to classical static form of the same game @xcite .",
    "the effects of decoherence produced by various prototype quantum channels on quantum stackelberg duopoly have been studied by zhu et al .",
    "we study the effects of correlated noise on quantum stackelberg duopoly , using amplitude damping , phase damping and depolarizing channels .",
    "in a quantum stackelberg duopoly game , for each firm @xmath14 and @xmath15 the game space is a two dimensional complex hilbert space of basis vectors @xmath16 and @xmath17 , that is , the game consists of two qubits , one for each firm .",

    "the firms payoffs under this situation become@xmath77 in the classical form of the duopoly the perfect game nash equilibrium is a point , whereas in this case it is a function of both decoherence and memory parameters .",
    "it can be easily seen that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite are retrieved by setting @xmath78 , and setting @xmath79 reproduces the results of classical game .",
    "the existence of nash equilibrium requires that firms moves ( @xmath80 and @xmath70 ) should have positive values .",
    "it can easily be checked using equation ( [ 16 ] ) that in the absence of quantum memory , no nash equilibrium exists for @xmath81 .",
    "the presence of quantum memory allows the existence of nash equilibrium for the entire range of values of @xmath7 , when @xmath82 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      the diagonal elements of the final density matrix of the game when it evolves under the action of correlated phase damping channel are given by@xmath83the payoffs of firms in quantum stackelberg duopoly game depend only on the diagonal elements of the final density matrix as can be seen from equations ( [ 11 ] and [ 12 ] ) .",
    "it is clear from equation ( [ 25 ] ) that the diagonal elements of the final density matrix are independent of the decoherence parameters as well as from the memory parameters .",
    "therefore , the correlated phase damping channel does not effect the outcome of the game .",
    "we study the influence of entanglement and correlated noise on the quantum stackelberg duopoly game by considering the time correlated amplitude damping , depolarizing and phase damping channels using kraus operator formalism .",
    "we have shown that in different entangling regions the follower advantage can be enhanced or weakened due to the existence of the initial state entanglement influenced by different correlated noise channels .",
    "the problem of nonexistence of the subgame perfect nash equilibrium in various regions due to the presence of decoherence is resolved by quantum memory .",
    "it is shown that under the action of amplitude damping channel , for initially unentangled state , the presence of quantum memory results into a critical point at the subgame perfect nash equilibrium .",
    "the firms are equally benefited at this point and the leader advantage vanishes . beyond this critical point ,",
    "the nash equilibrium of the game gives higher payoff to the follower firm as a result of quantum memory , that is , the game converts from leader advantage to the follower advantage game .",
    "quantum memory , in the case of amplitude damping channel , favors the follower firm in a particular range of values of entanglement parameter at the subgame perfect nash equilibrium . in this range of values of entanglement parameter ,",
    "the leader firm get worse off and the follower firm is better off ( see figure 2 ) . it is also observed that quantum memory validates the existence of nash equilibrium for the whole range of entanglement angle and decoherence parameter .",
    "it is also shown that quantum memory in the case of phase damping channel has no effect on the subgame perfect nash equilibrium and thus does not change the outcome of the game .    in the case of depolarizing channel quantum memory and entanglement in",
    "the initial state influences the firms payoffs at the subgame perfect nash equilibrium strongly in a way different from amplitude damping channel .",
    "it is seen that for @xmath84 , no nash equilibrium exists in case of unentangled initial state . whereas the presence of entanglement in the initial state extends the span of decoherence parameter @xmath85 from @xmath86 to @xmath87 for the existence of subgame perfect nash equilibrium in the absence of quantum memory . on the other hand ,",
    "we have observed that in the presence of memory , the subgame perfect nash equilibrium exists for the entire range of decoherence parameter in both of the situations ( for entangled and unentangled initial states ) .",
    "similarly , it has been shown that memory has a striking effect that there exists a nash equilibrium of the game for the entire range of entanglement parameter as well .",
    "whereas , in the absence of memory , the noisy environment limits the subgame perfect nash equilibrium to exist in a particular range of entanglement angle .",
    "in addition , a local maximum in payoffs is observed for small values of quantum memory parameters @xmath88 , @xmath9 . for highly correlated channel",
    "this local maximum disappears and the payoffs reduce to zero . unlike amplitude damping channel , the correlated depolarizing channel does not give rise to a critical point at the subgame perfect nash equilibrium and as a result , the game always remains a leader advantage game .",
