    "nucleon ( @xmath5 ) scattering .",
    "almost all modern @xmath5 potentials have been constructed considering the electromagnetic ( em ) interaction used in the nijmegen partial - wave analysis which includes the mm interaction between the two spin-@xmath6 particles as well as corrections to the @xmath7 coulomb potential as two - photon exchange , darwin - foldy and vacuum polarization terms .",
    "when @xmath4 scattering observables are computed with one of these potentials the long range behavior of the em interaction implies an infinite sum in the partial - wave series . for the particular case of the mm interaction , in refs .",
    "@xcite it has been shown how to sum analytically these infinite series for @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering .",
    "important effects of the mm interaction has been observed in both @xmath8 and @xmath7 vector analyzing powers at low energies .    due to the fact that @xmath4 potentials are constructed by fitting the @xmath5 available data , the three - nucleon ( @xmath9 ) system is the simplest one in which these potentials can be used to make predictions .",
    "however , in the description of the @xmath9 continuum the mm interaction and corrections to the coulomb potential has been systematically disregarded .",
    "this omission has been justified in the past by the intrinsic difficulties in solving the nuclear problem . at present ,",
    "the @xmath9 continuum is routinely solved by different techniques making possible the treatment of those electromagnetic terms beyond the coulomb interaction .    in the present paper",
    "we study @xmath0 elastic scattering including coulomb plus mm interactions .",
    "previous description of this process without considering the mm interaction has been performed by the authors using a technique based on the kohn variational principle ( kvp )  @xcite and expanding the scattering wave function in terms of the correlated hyperspherical harmonics basis  @xcite . following these works",
    "we perform a partial - wave decomposition of the scattering process . for states with low values of the relative orbital angular momentum @xmath1 of the projectile and the target ,",
    "the process is studied by solving the complete @xmath9 problem with the hamiltonian of the system containing nuclear plus coulomb plus mm interactions . for states with @xmath1 values",
    "sufficiently high , the centrifugal barrier prevents a close approach of the projectile to the target .",
    "so , the collision can be considered peripheral and treated as a two - body process .",
    "furthermore , in these states only the em interaction gives appreciable effects and the corresponding scattering amplitudes can be calculated in born approximation .",
    "the value of @xmath1 at which the treatment of the problem changes from a three - body description to a two - body description is to some extent arbitrary and could be different at different energies . in practice",

    "this is different from the @xmath10 case in which the coulomb divergence dominates in that region .",
    "regarding the vector analyzing powers , the mm interaction tends to slightly flatten the @xmath14 @xmath11 around the peak and to produce a pronounced dip structure at small scattering angles .",

    "however , this is an incomplete calculation since the inclusion of the mm interaction requires an infinite number of partial waves in the calculation of the transition matrix .",
    "when all three terms of eq.([tmnd ] ) are considered the observables are given by the dashed - dotted curves .",
    "it is interesting to notice the forward - angle dip structure which already appears in @xmath8 scattering  @xcite . only after summing the series up to @xmath166 this particular behavior",
    "can be reproduced .",
    "we can conclude that the mm interaction produces a pronounced modification of @xmath11 at forward angles but has a very small effect around the peak .    in order to show the importance of the mm moment interaction in the calculations of @xmath11 as the energy increases , in fig.2",
    "the results at @xmath167 mev are given .",
    "at this particular energy @xmath11 has been measured in an extended angular range including forward angles  @xcite .",
    "the solid line corresponds to a standard av18 calculation neglecting the mm interaction and including partial waves up to @xmath168 .",
    "the dashed - dotted line corresponds to a calculation using the av18+mm potential and considering the complete series .",
    "we can observe that the effect of the mm interaction on the peak is practically negligible .",
    "conversely , it is of great importance at forward angles in order to describe the zero crossing .    besides the neutron analyzing power and the deuteron analyzing power which present similar characteristics , other elastic @xmath14 observables as the tensor analyzing powers suffer only minor modifications when the mm interaction is included .",
    "the differences are of the order of @xmath13% or less and they are not presented here . however when comparisons with precise experimental data are performed these differences could be relevant and the mm interaction should be taking into account .    for @xmath10",
    "scattering high precision data exist at low energies  @xcite for differential cross section and vector and tensor analyzing powers .",
    "detailed comparisons to these data has been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite using av18 with and without the inclusion of three  nucleon forces . in those studies",
    "the coulomb interaction was included whereas the mm interaction was not . in order to evaluate the effects of the mm interaction on the vector analyzing powers in presence of the coulomb field , in fig.3 the results of the calculations at @xmath169 and @xmath154 mev",
    "are shown .",
    "three different calculations have been performed at both energies .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the av18 prediction neglecting the mm interaction .",
    "accordingly , the transition matrix has been calculated with the first two terms of eq.([tmpd ] ) .",
    "the partial - wave series of the second term has been summed up to @xmath170 ( @xmath169 mev ) and @xmath171 ( @xmath172 mev ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the same calculation as before but the @xmath2-matrix elements has been calculated using the av18+mm potential .",
    "the dashed - dotted line corresponds to the complete calculation including also the last two terms of eq.([tmpd ] ) .",
    "we see that the major effect of the mm interaction is obtained around the peak and is appreciable at both energies .",
    "there is also an improvement in the description of the observable at forward angles , in particular for @xmath12 at @xmath172 mev .",
    "the observed modifications are due to the interference between the coulomb and the nuclear plus the mm interaction and not to higher order terms , as in the @xmath14 case , since , except for @xmath11 at @xmath169 mev , the dashed and dashed - dotted line practically overlap . in fact , high order terms are dominated by the coulomb interaction and the mm interaction gives a very small contribution .",
    "as the energy increases , the effect of the mm interaction on @xmath11 and @xmath12 diminishes as it is shown in fig.4 at @xmath173 and @xmath174 mev . here the av18 prediction ( solid line ) has to be compared to the av18+mm prediction ( dashed line ) calculated using the first two terms of eq.([tmpd ] ) with @xmath168 . when the last two terms of eq.([tmpd ] ) are also included , the results are extremely close to the previous ones . as for the @xmath14 , the tensor analyzing powers present very small modifications when the mm interaction is taking into account and are not presented here .",
    "the mm interaction has different effects in @xmath14 or @xmath10 vector analyzing powers .",
    "one reason is the different sign between the neutron and proton magnetic moment .",
    "another reason is the interference with the coulomb field .",
    "however the mm interaction does not help for a better description of the neutron @xmath11 . on the contrary",
    "there is an appreciable improvement in the proton @xmath11 as well as in @xmath12 , in particular at very low energies .",
    "hence we can examine the differences between the experimental data and the theory at the peak in order to see if the inclusion of the mm interaction helps to clarify a different behavior observed for @xmath14 and @xmath10 . in fig.5 the relative difference @xmath175/a_y(exp)$ ] at the peak for @xmath14 and for @xmath10 scattering",
    "is shown . in this last case both , the av18 and av18+mm results have been reported . for @xmath14",
    "both results are extremely close at the peak , so the difference does not depend on which calculation ( av18 or av18+mm ) is considered . without the inclusion of the mm interaction the underestimation of the proton @xmath11 is much more pronounced than the neutron @xmath11 . when the mm interaction is considered the difference between theory and experiment for both , @xmath10 and @xmath14 scattering are of similar size , around @xmath176% , for all the energy values below @xmath177 mev . above @xmath177",
    "mev the differences at the peak between theory and experiment diminish . as shown in fig.5 , at @xmath178",
    "mev the difference is around @xmath179% . in fig.6",
    "the deuteron analyzing power @xmath12 is examined .",
    "the relative difference @xmath180/it_{11}(exp)$ ] is shown at the peak for @xmath10 scattering ( there is no data for the @xmath14 case ) using av18 and av18+mm . besides the first point at @xmath181 mev which corresponds to a very small value of @xmath12  @xcite , the underestimation of the observable oscillates around @xmath182% , very close to the @xmath11 case .",
    "finally we wish to discuss the importance of the coulomb effects as the energy increases .",
    "in fact , up to @xmath19 mev we can observe appreciable differences in the description of @xmath14 and @xmath10 elastic scattering that however tend to diminish  @xcite .",
    "experimental data are not always conclusive since experiments with neutrons have larger uncertainties than those performed with protons . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath14 calculations have been often used to describe @xmath10 scattering , in particular at high energies  @xcite . in order to clarify this approximation , in figs.78 @xmath14 and @xmath10 calculations at @xmath20 mev",

    ". as expected , coulomb effects are small at this energy",
    ". we can observe appreciable coulomb effects only in @xmath21 whereas three - nucleon interaction effects are found in the minimum of the differential cross section and in @xmath21 and @xmath184 as well .",
    "these results justify to some extent the description of @xmath10 data using @xmath14 calculations at intermediate energies , however with some caution in the description of particular observables .",
    "the mm interaction has been included in the description of @xmath0 scattering at low energies .",
    "though its strength is small compared to the nuclear interaction , it has a very long tail which behaves as @xmath185 . as a consequence ,",
    "the construction of the scattering amplitude necessitates an infinite number of partial waves .",
    "analytical summations of the corresponding @xmath10 and @xmath14 series have been given following previous works for @xmath5 scattering .",
    "accordingly , the @xmath186 transition matrix @xmath47 has been written as a sum of the standard coulomb amplitude plus the mm amplitude and a finite series of @xmath2matrices .",
    "these matrices have been calculated from a complete three ",
    "body description of the process with a hamiltonian including the nuclear plus coulomb plus mm interaction . for high @xmath1 values",
    ", the mm amplitude has been calculated as a two - body process . to this aim",
    "the mm interaction between a nucleon and the deuteron as distinct particles has been derived .",
    "different @xmath9 elastic observables have been calculated and compared to previous calculations in which the mm interaction was neglected .",
    "the main effect has been observed in the vector analyzing powers .",
    "however the modifications produced by the mm interaction do not improve the description of the neutron @xmath11 around the peak .",
    "conversely , there is an appreciable improvement in the proton @xmath11 and in @xmath12 , in particular at low energies . due to the different effect that the mm interaction produces in @xmath14 and @xmath10 scattering , the relative difference between the calculated and the measured @xmath11 at the peak results largely charge independent and approximately constant below @xmath177 mev .",
    "the underestimation is about @xmath176% . above this energy",
    "the difference starts to diminish . at @xmath187 mev",
    "it has been reduced to @xmath179% and above @xmath188 mev there is a much better description of @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is shown by the calculations performed at @xmath20 mev .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that at this energy coulomb effects are not important .",
    "only @xmath21 still shows some sensitivity .    the main aim of this work is to describe the three",
    "nucleon continuum using the same @xmath26 used in the description of the @xmath4 scattering states . in the past",
    "the mm interaction has been systematically neglected in the calculation of @xmath9 scattering observables with few exceptions . here",
    "we show how to include it and which terms are important . from the present analysis",
    "it can be concluded that the approximate treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite is justified for @xmath14 scattering but not for the @xmath10 case .",
    "in fact , in the calculation of the @xmath14 @xmath11 the symmetric spin",
    " orbit term in @xmath162 tends to depress the observable at the peak whereas the asymmetric term almost cancel this effect .",
    "therefore the transition matrix of eq.([tmnd ] ) can be constructed with the mm amplitudes @xmath124 and @xmath189 but neglecting the mm interaction in the calculation of the @xmath2-matrix elements @xmath190 for @xmath191 .",
    "in addition , the amplitude @xmath189 gives an extremely low contribution and can be neglected too . in the @xmath10 case the interference between the coulomb ,",
    "mm and nuclear interactions does not allow for the omission of the mm interaction in the calculation of the @xmath2matrix elements .",
    "otherwise the improvement at low energies on the peak of @xmath11 and @xmath12 is lost . however , in the construction of the transition matrix the last two terms in eq.([tmpd ] ) give very small contributions and , except at extremely low energies , can be omitted",
    ".    other small terms in the @xmath27 interaction as the two - photon coulomb and vacuum polarization interactions have been neglected in the present analysis .",
    "these terms have improved the description of @xmath7 scattering at low energies and , therefore , their inclusion in the description of @xmath10 scattering is of interest .",
