    "in 1958 , bohr , mottelson , and pines  @xcite suggested a possible analogy between the excitation spectra of nuclei and those of the superconducting metallic state . since then , a wealth of experimental data have been accumulated , supporting the important role played by pairing correlations in defining properties of atomic nuclei , such as deformation , moments of inertia , alignments , etc .",
    "today , the study of pairing correlations continues to be a subject of active research in nuclear physics , with an emphasis in exotic nuclei .",
    "of particular interest is the understanding of the role played by the isoscalar @xmath9 and isovector @xmath10 pairing forces  @xcite in the structure of @xmath11 nuclei .    given the charge independence of the nuclear force , @xmath12 pairing is on an equal footing between the @xmath13 neutron - proton ( np ) and @xmath14 neutron - neutron and proton - proton ( nn and pp ) components .",
    "in addition , we have the unique possibility of studying the formation of a condensate of @xmath2 np pairs , thus implying the possible co - existence of  cooper \" pairs of isoscalar and isovector type .",
    "although the nuclear force is stronger in the @xmath2 channel , it is still not clear how effective the ( _ in - medium _ ) @xmath2 correlations are in giving rise to a ground - state isoscalar condensate  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider some interesting properties of the isoscalar condensate in the @xmath8 coupling scheme , in particular with regards to its angular momentum .",
    "our motivation starts by studying the numerical results of a shell - model calculation , within the space of single - particle spin - orbit partners , showing that when the isoscalar component is dominant , the ground - state is not paired to @xmath15 but , rather , it behaves as a state of aligned @xmath16 _ quasi - deuterons_. to gain further insight into the peculiar structure of these condensates , we develop a boson mapping of the shell model , leading to an approximate analytic solution .",
    "group - theoretical solutions of the pairing problem are known in the isoscalar and isovector limits of @xmath17 coupling  @xcite and in the isovector limit of @xmath8 coupling  @xcite but , to our knowledge , not in the isoscalar limit of @xmath8 coupling .",
    "our results therefore provide , for the first time , approximate analytic formulae for the energies of the lowest states in that case .",
    "while we are of course aware that this limit is not applicable to real nuclei , these states might exist close to the ground state in specific regions of the @xmath18 line  @xcite and , more interestingly perhaps , could be realized in atomic traps .",
    "single - shell models that capture the main ingredients of the problem provide a useful framework to understand the competition of isovector and isoscalar pairing interactions . here",
    "we start by considering the scattering of @xmath19 nn , np , and pp pairs as well as @xmath20 np pairs , describing the large spatial overlap of the nucleons wave function in a relative @xmath21 state . in the @xmath8 coupling scheme the spin - orbit splitting @xmath22 increases the energy required to form the ( @xmath23 state , thus favoring a ( @xmath24 ) _ quasi - deuteron _ configuration .",
    "it then seems of interest to consider a more realistic case , namely that of a single-@xmath1 shell that incorporates the @xmath8 coupling scheme , more appropriate in heavier nuclei .",
