    "as standardized candles , type ia supernovae suggest that the universe is undergoing accelerating expansion@xcite . the same evidence has been shown by cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite and large scale structure ( lss)@xcite observations .",
    "all these data indicate the dominant component of the universe is relatively smooth and has a large negative pressure .",
    "all kinds of alternative models stand up for explaining this exotic phenomena within relativistic theory of gravity , which include the energy of the quantum vacuum ( such as cosmological constant @xmath18@xcite ) , the existence of another new scalar field ( quintessence@xcite which is possibly related to the inflaton , k - essence@xcite , tachyon@xcite , phantom@xcite , and quintom@xcite ) , and the influence of unseen additional spatial dimensions predicted by string theory@xcite . instead of the presence of dark energy , the most interesting idea for solving this dark riddle is depend on a new aspect of gravity which is not accounted for general relativity@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the current astronomical observations data still can not determine completely the nature of dark energy or decide its existence since this problem has puzzled us for a long time .    as one of plausible dynamical models for dark energy , chaplygin gas ( cg ) and the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg)@xcite , has created a lot of interest in recent times@xcite .",
    "cg or gcg behaves like pressureless dust at early times and like a cosmological constant during very late times .",
    "the fact that the properties of cg and gcg interpolate between those of cold dark matter ( cdm ) and a @xmath19-term makes the models to provide a conceptual framework for a unified model of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "besides , it is more worthy of note that the gcg model has been successfully confronted with various phenomenological tests such as high precision cmb data , supernovae data and gravitational lensing@xcite . on the other hand , since observations such as sne ia@xcite are still not sufficient to establish evidence of a dynamical equation of state for dark energy , we can naturally consider a fluid consisted of dark matter and quiessence dark energy with constant @xmath9 which full of the whole universe .",
    "thus , we propose a modified generalized chaplygin gas ( mgcg ) as the unified dark matter and dark energy revisited on some previous works@xcite .    with future deeper and more intensive surveys of sne ia , such as supernovae acceleration probe ( snap)@xcite , it provides a chance to distinguish different models of dark energy so that we will consider the so - called  geometrical \" or statefinder diagnostic since it can probe the expansion dynamics of the universe through higher derivatives of the scale factor .",
    "so , we must constrain the parameters ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) of the mgcg at first . the plat of this paper",
    "is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we give corresponding fundamental cosmology equations about mgcg .",
    "subsequently , in sec . 3 , we consider statefinder diagnostic of the mgcg .",
    "we then constrain the parameters of the mgcg by means of the sound speed @xmath10 , the age of the universe @xmath11 , the growth factor @xmath12 and the bias parameter @xmath13 in sec .",
    "finally , conclusion and our results are outlined in sec .",
    "an interesting unified model for two dark sectors is the chaplygin gas ( cg ) model@xcite introduced with @xmath20 .",
    "although this model has been very successful in explaining the sne ia data , it shows that cg model does not pass the tests connected with structure formation and observed strong oscillations of the matter power spectrum@xcite .",
    "this situation can be alleviated in the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) proposed with @xmath21 .",
    "and the parameter @xmath8 is rather severely constrained , i.e. , @xmath22 at the @xmath23 confidence level@xcite .",
    "since the difference between @xmath19cdm and gcg models is so tiny and the equation of state of dark energy still can not be determined exactly , a new generalized chaplygin gas ( ngcg)@xcite proposed by considering that @xmath24 in gcg is a function of redshift @xmath25 .",
    "following this idea , we develop gcg - like models from another view . as a purely kinetic k - essence model with a constant potential ,",
    "the tachyon fields can be considered as cg model @xcite . meanwhile",
    "the tachyon field can also act as a source of dark energy depending upon the form of the tachyon potential .",
    "thus , the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite introduced an extended tachyon field ( etf ) and then provided a modified chaplygin gas ( mcg)@xcite , in which the equation of state ( eos ) has a more generalized form @xmath26 where @xmath24 and @xmath8 are constants . as a kind of new attempt just like the extension from gcg to ngcg , we present a modified generalized chaplygin gas ( mgcg ) through replacing @xmath24 in eq .",

    "( [ perturbation ] ) numerically , when the initial conditions are chosen as @xmath239 and @xmath240 , we plot the linear density perturbation for dark matter @xmath221 as a function of @xmath134 ( see fig .",

    "[ fig11 ] , we can see the perturbation starts departing from the linear behavior around @xmath241 i.e. @xmath242 which is similar to the epoch when @xmath243 . through the energy transferring from dark matter to dark energy",

    "when we consider the period after decoupling , the baryons are no longer coupled to photons so that the baryons are also a pressureless fluid like the dark matter . then , we derive the baryon perturbation as follows @xmath244 then we investigate the growth factor @xmath222 and the bias @xmath223 where @xmath245 , @xmath246 is the linear growth function , @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] that between the present and @xmath249 , the growth factor @xmath222 and the bias @xmath223 are quite sensitive to the values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "[ fig14 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] , we have shown the contours for the growth factor @xmath222 and the bias @xmath223 in the @xmath8 - @xmath9 plane under the boundary of domain constrained by @xmath10 . on the other hand , the growth factor and the bias parameter at @xmath250 have been determined using the 2dfgrs .",

    "are obtained under @xmath18cdm when converting redshift to distances for the power spectra .",
    "the right way is to conduct data processing for @xmath13 and @xmath255 by using 2dfgrs data under our model .",
    "then we can constrain @xmath8 and @xmath9 by using the fitted values . in this paper",
    "we use the above fitted data temporarily and our future work will focus on this tough work .    in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] , we consider four restrictions together to give the best estimation of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "[ fig15 ] ) under the boundary of domain constrained by the sound speed .",
    "each set leads to a reduced @xmath256 : @xmath257(theory values - observation values)@xmath258/(observational error)@xmath258 . to combine the constraints on @xmath8 and @xmath9 coming from the age of the universe @xmath11 , growth factor @xmath12 and the bias @xmath13 within the domain given by the limits of the sound speed @xmath10",
    ", we have added their individual @xmath256 as if they were part of a total experiment with uncorrelated gaussian errors : @xmath259 .",
    "therefore , we plot the contour level @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 , where @xmath263 , defines , respectively , for two degrees of freedom the @xmath224 , @xmath225 and @xmath226 confidence levels represented in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] .",
    "the @xmath227 fit values are @xmath14 and @xmath15 . noted that the presence of the cutoff contours curves in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] is due to the restricted area boundary which comes from the limits of @xmath10 .",
    "a new model named as the modified generalized chaplygin gas ( mgcg ) , which is a further generalization of the generalized chaplygin gas , has been proposed in the present paper . as a version of the unified dark matter and dark energy , this mgcg fluid is consisted of dark matter and quiessence dark energy with constant @xmath9 .",
    "firstly , fundamental cosmology equations for the mgcg have been described . for tests with future deep observations ,",
    "we then consider the statefinder diagnostic since it can probe the expansion dynamics of the universe through higher derivatives of the scale factor .",
