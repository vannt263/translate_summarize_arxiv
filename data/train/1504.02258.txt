    "when two superconductors are in close proximity , they are influenced by each other via the tunneling of cooper pairs .",
    "the cooper - pair tunneling results in the flow of a superconducting josephson current , which has been studied for decades and is used in various superconducting quantum devices  @xcite .",
    "the josephson current is governed by the phase difference of the order parameters of the two superconductors .",
    "therefore , josephson junctions consisting of unconventional superconductors , where the superconducting order parameter changes its sign depending on the momentum direction , serve as a unique platform where novel phase - related phenomena , e.g. , spontaneous formation of half flux quanta in a tri - junction of cuprate superconductors  @xcite , take place .",
    "compared with the well - investigated josephson currents , the spatial and energy dependence of the superconducting order parameter and quasiparticle states around these junctions remain to be understood .",
    "recent progress in scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and spectroscopy ( sts ) technologies opens up a way to directly visualize the spatial variation of the electronic states in superconducting hetero - structures  @xcite .",
    "however , stm / sts studies on superconducting junctions made of unconventional superconductors are still demanding .",
    "there are two reasons which make it difficult to study unconventional junctions .",
    "first , it is often challenging to artificially fabricate well - defined junctions of unconventional superconductors .",
    "second , in most of unconventional superconductors , surfaces are not electronically neutral ; the resultant charge accumulation at the surfaces prevents stm / sts from accessing bulk superconducting properties . in this study",
    ", we solve these problems by inspecting the twin boundaries ( tbs ) in the nodal iron - based superconductor fese  @xcite .",
    "the tb is a crystallographic plane in a crystal shared by two neighboring domains with one being the mirror image of the other .",
    "the tbs are often formed by a tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural phase transition , which reduces the four - fold ( @xmath4 ) symmetry at high temperature to two - fold ( @xmath5 ) symmetry at low temperature .",
    "in such a case , the orthorhombic crystal may contain the tbs parallel to the ( 110 ) plane , which act as an atomically well - defined junction .",
    "some unconventional - superconductor - related materials , such as yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 , ae(fe@xmath9co@xmath10)@xmath6as@xmath6 ( ae : alkali - earth element ) and nafeas , do form tbs upon the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic transition which were identified by stm / sts measurements  @xcite",
    ". however , unavoidable surface state formation and/or insufficient amount of chemical doping prevent the stm / sts measurements to access superconductivity near tbs in these materials .",
    "fese ( superconducting transition temperature @xmath11  k  @xcite ) is a promising candidate for studying the effects of tbs on unconventional superconductivity by stm / sts . among various iron - based superconductors , fese has the simplest crystal structure [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] in which electronically neutral two - dimensional fese layers are stacked along the @xmath12 axis  @xcite .",
    "this guarantees the perfect cleaved surface which is electronically neutral .",
    "the tetragonal - to - orthorhombic structural phase transition , which is likely caused by the orbital ordering  @xcite , occurs at @xmath13  k and the tbs are spontaneously formed in the orthorhombic phase as illustrated in fig .",
    "band - structure calculations show that the fermi surface of fese consists of hole cylinders around the zone center and compensating electron cylinders around the zone corner  @xcite .",
    "several measurements , including penetration depth , quasiparticle interference , thermoelectric response  @xcite , quantum oscillations  @xcite , and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite reveal that the fermi surface in the orthorhombic phase consists of one hole and one ( or two @xcite ) electron bands , both of which have very low carrier densities .",
    "the tunneling spectrum  @xcite , temperature dependence of the penetration depth down to 80  mk and the residual thermal conductivity at @xmath14  @xcite , all provide strong evidence that fese is an unconventional superconductor with line nodes in the superconducting gap .",
    "the tbs in fese have been studied by low - temperature ( 4.2  k ) stm / sts in the films grown by molecular beam epitaxy and the suppression of superconductivity by the tbs has been reported  @xcite .",
    "we performed stm / sts measurements at much lower temperature ( @xmath15  k ) in vapor - grown single crystals to examine the details of the superconducting gap and quasiparticle excitations near the tbs .",
    "stm / sts experiments were conducted in a constant - current mode with a commercial ultra - high vacuum very - low temperature stm ( unisoku , usm-1300 ) modified by ourselves  @xcite .",
    "the samples used in this study were high - quality bulk single crystals grown using the vapor transport method  @xcite .",
    "superconducting transition temperature defined at zero resistance is about 9  k. these crystals are undoped and stoichiometric , enabling us to investigate uniform and clean tbs .",
    "samples were cleaved _ in - situ _ at liquid n@xmath6 temperature to prepare clean and flat ( 001 ) surfaces . immediately after cleaving , the samples were transferred to the stm unit kept below 10  k. we used electrochemically - etched polycrystalline tungsten wires for the scanning tips which were cleaned and sharpened _ in - situ _ by field evaporation using field - ion microscopy .",
    "the tunneling conductance @xmath16 reflecting the local density of states ( ldos ) at a position @xmath17 and energy @xmath18 , was acquired by standard lock - in technique . here ,",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the tunneling current and the sample - bias voltage , respectively .",
    "figure  1(c ) depicts an stm image of the cleaved surface of an fese single crystal at temperature @xmath21  k. the image demonstrates the extremely small concentration of defects , i.e. about one defect per 5000 fe atoms in the ( 001 ) plane .",
    "there is a shallow `` groove '' running along the [ 110 ] direction of the fe lattice across which the unidirectional feature around the point defect is rotated by @xmath0 , indicating that the `` groove '' represents the tb .",
    "we also observed that the elongated vortex cores  @xcite , which were imaged by mapping @xmath22 in a magnetic field , are rotated by @xmath0 across the tb [ fig .",
    "what is intriguing is that the vortices trapped at the tb are not elongated along the tb , demonstrating that the critical current density across the tb is comparable to that of the bulk .",
    "the stm image of the tb at a lower bias voltage is not a `` groove '' but a `` ridge '' [ figs .",
    "this suggests that the apparent corrugations near the tb are primarily associated with the electronic - state variations ; the actual surface topography near the tb may be essentially flat . a magnified stm image near the tb is shown in fig .",
    "1(f ) . a regular square lattice of the top - most se atoms",
    "is well maintained even in the close vicinity of the tb .",
    "these observations indicate that the tb in fese is an atomically sharp superconducting junction with minimal strain to the lattice .",
    "( a detailed argument regarding the absence of strain is given in appendix  a. )          we examined the ldos evolution across the tb by taking a series of @xmath23 along the line indicated in fig .",
    "2(a ) . here and in the following",
    ", we are interested only in the evolution of @xmath23 along the @xmath24 axis running perpendicular to the tb leaving the @xmath25 coordinate constant , hence @xmath26 .",
    "figure  2(b ) shows an intensity plot of @xmath23 .",
    "individual spectra taken at representative points are depicted in fig .",
    "at the position far away from the tb ( i ) , @xmath23 exhibits a superconducting gap with clear quasiparticle peaks at @xmath27  mev .",
    "in addition to this main feature , there is a shoulder outside of the main peaks ( @xmath28  mev ) , which may represent multiple superconducting gaps  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the case of fully - gapped superconductors in which @xmath29 in an extended @xmath18 region near @xmath30 , @xmath23 in fese approaches zero only for @xmath31 and apparently v - shaped , indicating the presence of line nodes  @xcite .",
    "even right at the tb ( iii ) , the residual ldos at @xmath30 is negligibly small , indicating that the tb hardly gives rise to a pair breaking effect . in the vicinity of the tb , the quasiparticle peak and the shoulder associated with the superconducting gap diminish , and instead , sharp particle - hole symmetric peaks appear at @xmath32  mev . in the crossover region ( ii ) , the 1.5  mev peak coexists with the 2.5  mev peak , meaning that the former is not associated with the suppressed superconducting gap .",
    "the 1.5  mev peak diminishes within a distance of about 5  nm from the tb , which is close to the `` averaged '' in - plane coherence length @xmath33  nm obtained from the upper critical field @xmath3415  t  @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that the 1.5  mev peak represents the bound state induced by the tb .",
    "another interesting observation is that low - energy quasiparticle excitations are modified over a very long distance from the tb .",
    "high - resolution @xmath23 spectra at the positions of ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) are plotted in fig .",
    "while the overall v - shaped behavior is maintained , the exact shape near the bottom of the gap depends on the position . in order to examine this behavior ,",
    "we fit an empirical power - law @xmath35 to the low - energy ( @xmath36  mev ) spectra and plot the exponent @xmath37 as a function of the distance from the tb at @xmath38 [ fig .",
    "2(e ) ] . except close to the tb ( @xmath39 ) where the 1.5  mev peaks dominate",
    ", @xmath37 increases gradually with decreasing @xmath24 by about @xmath40% .",
    "this implies the suppression of the low - energy quasiparticle excitations , most probably due to the opening of a small gap induced by the tb .",
    "the salient feature is that @xmath37 continues to change even at @xmath41 ( @xmath42  nm ) , indicating an unexpectedly long - distance influence of the tb .",
    "the long - distance tb effect on the ldos can be seen in a more dramatic way in two junctions in series formed by two tbs . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) we find an area where two tbs are running parallel to each other .",
    "the distance between the tbs is 34  nm , which is about 7 times larger than @xmath1 .",
    "figure  3(b ) shows the spatial evolution of @xmath23 across the double tbs .",
    "individual spectra at representative points are plotted in fig .",
    "the overall spectral features , the 2.5  mev peak , the 3.5  mev shoulder and the 1.5  mev peak observed near a single tb are all reproduced ( positions i , ii , and iii ) . however",
    ", the low - energy spectrum taken inside the central domain ( position iv ) shows a striking anomaly which is absent in the case of a single tb . figure  3(d ) depicts @xmath23 spectra at low energies .",
    "it is clear that , in between the double tbs , there is a finite energy range where @xmath23 is almost completely zero .",
    "the noticeable difference of the gap structure between inside and outside the central domain is clearly seen in fig .",
    "3(e ) , which shows the exponent @xmath37 plotted as a function of the distance from one of the tbs ; @xmath37 is strongly enhanced in the central domain and peaks at the middle of the domain .",
    "the large power @xmath43 , which is @xmath44 times larger than the values at large @xmath24 , essentially indistinguishable from an exponential energy dependence .",
    "this apparent large power again corroborates the finite gap opening in the excitation spectrum of quasiparticle .",
    "the above observations , the tb - induced bound states at finite energies and the suppression of the low - energy quasiparticle excitations over a length scale much longer than @xmath1 , suggest a novel role of the tb in an unconventional superconductor . before discussing the origin of these anomalies , we briefly review what can be expected at a tb of fese .",
    "recent high - resolution laser - arpes measurements of fese indicate that the hole cylinder is fully gapped  @xcite , implying that the line nodes are present on the electron cylinder , as has been also inferred from vortex imaging  @xcite . given this information ,",
    "we consider two possible phase structures for symmetry of the superconducting gap across a tb as illustrated in fig .  4 , where either the global phase of the superconducting gap is fixed to the crystallographic axis [ fig .",
    "4(a ) ] or is flipped across the tb [ fig .",
    "it should be noted that the sign of either the nodal gap or the nodeless gap is reversed between the two domains in fig .",
    "4(a ) or fig .  4(b ) , respectively .",
    "this means that the amplitude of at least one of the gaps vanishes at the tb , giving rise to the zero - energy quasiparticle state that should appear as a zero - energy peak in @xmath23 .",
    "this argument applies not only for the particular phase structure shown in fig .  4 but also for a general case in which nodal and nodeless gaps reside on multiple fermi surfaces .",
    "the observed bound - state peak at 1.5  mev apparently contradicts this conjecture and suggests instead that the tb induces an additional gap component which shifts the position of a zero - energy peak to a finite energy .",
    "we point out that , as long as the induced gap is real , a sum of the bulk gap and the tb - induced gap reverses its sign at a finite distance from the tb and still gives rise to a zero - energy peak .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) , we did not observe a zero - energy peak in @xmath23 over more than 100  nm from the tb .",
    "thus , we speculate that the induced gap has an imaginary component , which means that time reversal symmetry is locally broken near the tb .",
    "in such a case , bound state peaks are located at finite energies @xmath45 because the phase shift @xmath46 on the tb is reduced from @xmath47  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath48 is the amplitude of the superconducting gap .",
    "the possibility of the tb - induced time - reversal - symmetry - broken state has been argued theoretically in @xmath49-wave yba@xmath6cu@xmath7o@xmath8 with a small @xmath50-wave component  @xcite , but the experimental observation is still lacking .        in order to substantiate the relevance of this scenario , we have calculated the spatial evolution of the ldos for a model order parameter with broken time - reversal symmetry near tbs .",
    "the @xmath5-symmetric order parameter is represented by a sum of the isotropic component @xmath51 and the four - fold nodal component @xmath52 ,    @xmath53    where @xmath54 is the azimuthal angle in the momentum space ; see fig .  4 .",
    "we assume that the global phase of the order parameter is fixed to the crystallographic axis , that is , the nodal component changes its sign across a tb as shown in fig .",
    "the spatial variation of @xmath55 around a tb at @xmath56 is modeled by the form    @xmath57\\cos\\theta(x)+i\\sin\\theta(x)\\},\\ ] ]    where the @xmath24 axis is taken to be perpendicular to the tb , and @xmath58 is the amplitude of @xmath55 in the bulk .",
    "the phase @xmath59 of @xmath60 equals @xmath61 for @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "the phase variable @xmath61 is assumed to take a nonvanishing value near the tb and exponentially decay with another length scale @xmath65 .",
    "it is important to note that the characteristic length @xmath66 for the local time - reversal symmetry breaking can be much longer than the coherence length @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "( the derivation of the length @xmath66 is given in appendix  b. ) to account for low - energy excitations near the nodes observed in the ldos , we focus on the electron cylinder with nodal gaps by setting the parameters @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "as a model order parameter with a tb at @xmath70 , we take @xmath71 with @xmath72 , which gives @xmath73 .",
    "the order parameter @xmath60 is shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) , where @xmath74 changes with the length scale @xmath67 while @xmath75 decays with the longer length scale @xmath66 .",
    "the phase @xmath59 abruptly changes near the tb and gradually approaches @xmath76 or @xmath47 . using this order parameter",
    ", we calculate the spatial dependence of the ldos within the quasi - classical approximation  @xcite .",
    "figure 5(b ) shows the global peak structure of the ldos at representative points calculated with energy smearing of @xmath77 .",
    "far from the tb , namely in the bulk ( i ) , the ldos has peaks at @xmath78 . on the tb ( iii ) ,",
    "the peaks observed in the bulk are suppressed , and alternative peaks appear at @xmath79 , which correspond to the bound states whose energies are shifted from @xmath30 due to the local time - reversal symmetry breaking in @xmath55 .",
    "the bound - state peaks disappear at @xmath80 ( ii ) since their wave functions decay into the bulk with the length scale @xmath67 .",
    "these features of the calculated ldos arising from the bound states are consistent with the ldos peaks observed at @xmath81  mev by stm .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "5(c ) the ldos at lower energy scale which has been calculated with a much smaller smearing factor @xmath82 .",
    "the clear v - shaped ldos in the bulk ( i ) changes to the u - shaped ldos upon approaching the tb , in agreement with the increase of the exponent @xmath37 evaluated from the experimental data [ fig .",
    "the low - energy ldos is finite at @xmath38 ( iii ) and @xmath80 ( ii ) because low - energy quasiparticles with momenta along the nodal directions of the bulk gap can linger over long distance and reach the tb , even though the local gap ,    @xmath83 ^ 2 + [ { \\rm im}(\\delta_{4\\phi})\\sin(2\\phi)]^2},\\ ] ]    does not vanish near the tb where @xmath84 .",

    "we assume that the distance @xmath87 between the tbs is in the range @xmath88 .",
    "the phase @xmath61 is an even function of @xmath24 and takes a maximum value at @xmath38 .",
    "the global peak structure of the ldos and its low - energy blowup are shown for representative points along the @xmath24 direction in fig .",
    "5(e ) and 5(f ) , respectively . the large peaks at @xmath89 on a tb ( iii ) and the small peaks at @xmath90 at the middle point @xmath38 between the tbs ( iv ) in fig .",
    "5(e ) originate from the same dispersive mode of bound states at a tb . the calculated ldos spectrum at @xmath38 between the double tbs ( iv ) in fig .",
    "5(f ) exhibits a clear energy gap extending over the region @xmath91 , reflecting the existence of a larger local gap at @xmath38 , where the bulk low - energy quasiparticles can not reach .",
    "we conclude that the local gap enhanced by the local time - reversal symmetry breaking near tbs over the length scale @xmath65 can explain the strong suppression of the ldos between the two tbs observed in our stm / sts experiments .",
    "we have reported on the visualization of the atomic scale variation of the quasiparticle states of the nodal superconductor fese near tbs that enforce a sign inversion at least one of the superconducting gaps opening on multiple fermi cylinders .",
    "in contrast to the expectation that the sign inversion generates a zero - energy quasiparticle bound state near the tb , the tb - induced quasiparticle states are not at zero but at finite energies @xmath92  mev . moreover , the low - energy excitation spectrum is affected by the tb over an extremely long distance , which is a few tens of times larger than @xmath1 .",
    "an even more dramatic change in the low - energy spectrum has been detected in the region between double tbs separated by a distance @xmath93 , where the quasiparticle weight near the fermi energy is almost completely removed in the energy range @xmath94  mev .",
    "these observations are qualitatively reproduced by a phenomenological model which assumes that the tb induces locally a superconducting state that breaks time - reversal symmetry .",
    "our results suggest several important directions for future studies . a microscopic mechanism that induces the time - reversal symmetry",
    "broken state is elusive and should be investigated theoretically .",
    "it is also interesting to go beyond the quasi - classical approximation because fese is a unique superconductor whose fermi energy is of the same order as the superconducting gap , placing this system in the bcs - bec crossover regime  @xcite .",
    "experiments that directly probe the time - reversal symmetry breaking , such as muon - spin rotation and local magnetometry , are highly desirable and would give us further insights into the unconventional superconducting junctions .",
    "we anticipate that the tbs in fese will stimulate further research on the role of the phase of the superconducting order parameter near the interface , which has been difficult to access experimentally",

    "<S> junctions and interfaces consisting of unconventional superconductors provide an excellent experimental playground to study exotic phenomena related to the phase of the order parameter . not only the complex structure of unconventional order parameters have an impact on the josephson effects , but also may profoundly alter the quasi - particle excitation spectrum near a junction . here , by using spectroscopic - imaging scanning tunneling microscopy </S>",
    "<S> , we visualize the spatial evolution of the local density of states ( ldos ) near twin boundaries ( tbs ) of the nodal superconductor fese . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 rotation of the crystallographic orientation across the tb twists the structure of the unconventional order parameter , which may , in principle , bring about a zero - energy ldos peak at the tb . </S>",
    "<S> the ldos at the tb observed in our study , in contrast , does not exhibit any signature of a zero - energy peak and an apparent gap amplitude remains finite all the way across the tb . </S>",
    "<S> the low - energy quasiparticle excitations associated with the gap nodes are affected by the tb over a distance more than an order of magnitude larger than the coherence length @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the modification of the low - energy states is even more prominent in the region between two neighboring tbs separated by a distance @xmath2 . in this region </S>",
    "<S> the spectral weight near the fermi level ( @xmath30.2  mev ) due to the nodal quasiparticle spectrum is almost completely removed . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors suggest that the tb induces a fully - gapped state , invoking a possible twist of the order parameter structure which breaks time - reversal symmetry . </S>"
