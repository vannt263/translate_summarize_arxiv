    "deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) has been an important tool in particle physics for more than twenty - five years .",
    "recent high precision measurements by groups such as the nmc , smc and various slac groups  @xcite are testing the limits of our theoretical knowledge of the structure of the nucleon .",
    "the smc and the e143 groups @xcite have recently reported the first measurements of the transverse spin structure function @xmath1 , which has a twist - three component @xmath2 . in the near future we can also expect the hermes experiment to investigate the spin dependent structure functions in some detail .",
    "also the development of polarized beams at rhic will lead to measurements of the chiral - odd distributions @xmath3 , which are twist - two and twist - three respectively  @xcite .",
    "higher twist structure functions will also be important at the energies of cebaf and the proposed elfe accelerator because of the phenomenon of hadron - parton duality  @xcite , or ` precocious scaling '  @xcite .",
    "this predicts that at even moderate values of @xmath0 , higher twist contributions to observables , such as the nucleon form factor , will be non - negligible .",
    "thus it is important to have some theoretical understanding on the expected sizes and shapes of the higher twist structure functions .    in a recent paper ,",
    "ji  @xcite defined the 14 possible nucleon structure functions in the standard model , and calculated each structure function in terms of all the possible parton distribution functions up to the level of twist - four ( ignoring loop effects from qcd radiative corrections ) .",
    "the parton distribution ( or correlation ) functions are defined in terms of fourier transforms of matrix elements of non - local quark and gauge fields separated along the light - cone  @xcite . at present these matrix elements",
    "can not be calculated in qcd , however calculations of twist - two matrix elements using the wavefunction of the mit bag model have been performed  @xcite , and these describe current data relatively well . in this paper these calculations are extended to all the parton distribution functions of twist - three and four containing only two quark fields .",
    "following ji  @xcite , let us consider a nucleon of mass @xmath4 with momentum @xmath5 and polarisation vector @xmath6 .",
    "if we choose the nucleon to be moving along the @xmath7-axis with momentum @xmath8 we have    @xmath9    we introduce two orthogonal , light - like vectors @xmath10 and @xmath11    @xmath12    satisfying @xmath13 .",
    "we also decompose the polarisation vector , @xmath14 , where @xmath15    a parton distribution with @xmath16 light - cone momentum fractions @xmath17 is defined via the matrix element @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a product of @xmath16 quark and gluon fields , and @xmath20 is a lorentz tensor .",
    "if the mass dimension of the parton distribution @xmath21 is @xmath22 and that of @xmath20 is @xmath23 , then at large @xmath0 the matrix element will behave as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a soft qcd mass scale related to non - perturbative physics . a distribution with mass dimension @xmath22",
    "is called a twist-@xmath26 distribution . as the dimension of a physical observable",
    "is fixed , the higher @xmath22 becomes , the higher the inverse power of hard momenta must become in the observable .",
    "thus a twist-@xmath11 parton distribution can only contribute to physical observables of twist-@xmath11 or higher , which behave as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , in the @xmath29 limit . in the following",
    "we will often rescale a parton distribution by factors of @xmath30 to make it dimensionless , but the twist willl be unchanged .    for scattering processes involving two quark fields we can define a quark density matrix @xmath31 from this it is possible to systematically generate the possible distributions at a given twist .",
    "the twist-2 part of the density matrix can be written @xmath32 where the three quark distribution functions @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are defined @xmath36 these represent the unpolarized quark density , the quark helicity density and the quark transversity density  @xcite respectively .",
    "the light - cone gauge , @xmath37 , has been chosen , so that the distributions are manifestly gauge invariant .    similarly at the twist-3 level , the appropriate portion of the quark density matrix can be written @xmath38\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a soft mass scale in qcd .",
    "the three twist-3 distribution functions are given by @xmath39\\ ] ] with the twist-4 distributions @xmath40    the quark field @xmath41 can be decomposed into ` good ' and ` bad ' components , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively @xmath44 by inspection it can be seen that the twist-2 quark distributions involve only the ` good ' component @xmath42 , whereas the twist-3 distributions involve mixing one ` good ' and one ` bad ' component , and the twist-4 distributions involve only the ` bad ' components .",
    "the qcd equations of motion  @xcite @xmath45 make it possible to eliminate the ` bad ' components from the twist - three and four distributions , at the cost of introducing gluon fields into the matrix elements . because the model wavefunctions do not include gluon fields",
    ", we will not do this here . also note that at twist - three and twist - four there exist distributions involving the gluon field with two or three light - cone momentum fractions , such as  @xcite @xmath46 and @xmath47 which can be related to @xmath48 and @xmath49 by integrating over @xmath50 or @xmath50 and @xmath7 respectively .",
    "however , as the mit bag wavefunction has no explicit gluon field , these distributions will be zero in the model .",
    "also the distributions with only one light - cone momentum fraction are of the most interest for dis and drell - yan processes .    finally there",
    "exist distributions at the twist - four level involving four quark operators eg @xmath51 which is a four quark light - cone correlation function . calculating this distribution by the method below would require the evaluation of the overlap integral between the four quark fields over the bag volume , which is expected to much smaller than the two quark overlap integral required for the two quark correlation functions .",
    "hence these will not considered further in this work .",
    "at present no qcd wavefunction for the nucleon can be calculated .",
    "so in order to make useful calculations of the quark distributions at any twist it is necessary to the use the wavefunction from some phenomenological model of the nucleon .",
    "the mit bag model  @xcite is used here as it incorporates relativistic , light quarks , and also models confinement",
    ". it also has the further advantage that the wavefunction is simple and analytic .",
    "other models could also be chosen  @xcite .",
    "the major problem in calculating the relevant matrix elements for the quark distributions is ensuring that momentum conservation is obeyed throughout the calculation , hence ensuring that the calculated distributions have the correct support , i.e. they vanish for light - cone momentum fraction @xmath52 outside the interval @xmath53 $ ] @xcite . to guarantee momentum conservation , a complete set of intermediate states , @xmath54 ,",
    "can be inserted into the matrix elements of the quark distributions ( eqns .",
    "( [ eq : tw2 ] , [ eq : tw3 ] , [ eq : tw4 ] ) ) . using translational invariance of the matrix element , all the @xmath11 dependence can be moved into the argument of the exponential function .",
    "then integrating over @xmath55 gives a momentum conserving delta function .",
    "the twist - two quark distributions then become @xmath56 , \\label{eq : t2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the projection operator for right-(left- ) handed quarks @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the projection operator @xmath60 , which projects out eigenstates of the transversely projected pauli - lubanski operator @xmath61 in a transversely projected nucleon .",
    "the twist - four distributions are similar to those of twist - two , except they involve ` bad ' components of the quark wavefunction @xmath62 .",
    "\\label{eq : t4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the distributions have been rescaled to make them dimensionless , and factors of @xmath63 have been absorbed in the twist - four part of the density matrix , @xmath64 .",
    "note that the twist - two and twist - four distributions have a natural interpretation in the parton model , where they are related to the probability of finding a parton carrying fraction @xmath52 of the plus component of momentum of the nucleon , and in the appropriate helicity or transversity eigenstates . in the twist - three case ,",
    "the distributions do not have a similar interpretation in the parton model .",
    "however we can still guarantee momentum conservation by introducing a complete set of intermediate states , @xmath54 , and then write the distributions in terms of the matrix elements between nucleon states and intermediate states @xmath65 where the matrix indices have been shown explicitly . again",
    "the distributions have been rescaled so that they are dimensionless , absorbing factors of @xmath66 into the density matrix @xmath67 .",
    "the next step in the model calculation of the distributions is to form the momentum eigenstates @xmath68 and @xmath69 from the static states of the model .",
    "this can be done using either the peierls - yoccoz  @xcite projection , which gives a momentum dependent normalisation , or the peierls - thouless  @xcite projection , which leads to a more difficult calculation , but which preserves galilean invariance of the matrix elements . using either method ,",
    "the correct support for the distributions is guaranteed by the above formalism .",
    "the distributions can then be calculated in terms of the hill - wheeler overlap integrals between the quark wavefunctions  @xcite .",
    "using the wavefunction of a model also introduces a scale @xmath70 into the calculated distribution functions .",
    "this is the scale at which the model wavefunction is considered a good approximation to the true qcd wavefunction , which is presently unknown .",
    "the natural scale for the bag model , and most other phenomenological models employing light relativistic quarks , is the typical transverse momentum of the quarks , @xmath71 . in order to compare a calculated distribution function with experiment",
    ", the calculated distribution needs to be evolved from the model scale up to the experimental scale @xmath0 .",
    "this has previously been done using leading order qcd evolution for the twist-2 distributions @xmath72 and @xmath73  @xcite , with good agreement being obtained for a value of @xmath70 in the region of 250  500 mev .",
    "this could be criticised on the grounds that the strong coupling constant is not small in this region , however calculations using next to leading order evolution@xcite also give good agreement with experiment for values of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "for the higher twist distributions there do not yet exist comprehensive calculations of the relevant anomalous dimensions for evolution of the distribution functions . for the twist - three distributions @xmath2 and @xmath76 full calculations of the anomalous dimensions have appeared in the literature @xcite . for the lowest moments of these distributions ( @xmath77 ) , the leading order evolution gives similar results to naive power counting for @xmath78 in the region of 1 gev .",
    "thus we shall neglect qcd corrections to the evolution of the higher twist distributions , and use naive power counting to evolve these distributions .    in figure 1 the nine twist-2 , 3 and 4 distributions involving two quark correlation functions , calculated at the bag scale @xmath70 , for a bag radius of 0.8 fm",
    "are shown .",
    "the peierls - yoccoz projection has been used to form the momentum eigenstates @xmath79 and @xmath69 , and only intermediate states containing two quarks have been considered . as is expected from equations   ( [ eq : t2 ] , [ eq : t4 ] , [ eq : t3 ] ) ,",
    "each of these distribution functions are similar in magnitude to one another .",
    "it is worth noting that the parton distributions satisfy the equalities @xmath80 which are the lower bounds of soffer s inequalities@xcite .",
    "the evolution of the twist-3 distributions is particularly interesting as the distributions have contributions from local operators of both twist-3 and twist-2 .",
    "hence the moments of the twist-3 distributions are related to the moments of the twist-2 distributions @xcite @xmath81 & = & \\frac{m}{m } { \\cal m}_{n}[f_{1 } ] + { \\cal m}_{n}[e^{(3 ) } ]   \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal m}_{n}[h_{l } ] & = & \\frac{2}{n+2}{\\cal m}_{n}[h_{1 } ] + \\frac{n}{n+2 }   \\frac{m}{m}{\\cal m}_{n-1}[g_{1 } ] + { \\cal m}_{n}[h_{l}^{(3 ) } ] \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal m}_{n}[g_{t } ] & = & \\frac{1}{n+1 } { \\cal m}_{n}[g_{1 } ] - \\frac{1}{2 }   \\frac{m}{m}{\\cal m}_{n-1}[h_{1 } ] + { \\cal m}_{n}[g_{t}^{(3)}]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the quark mass , @xmath83 = \\int_{0}^{1 } x^{n}f(x)dx$ ] is the @xmath11th moment of the distribution @xmath84 and @xmath85 denotes the genuine twist-3 part of the distribution @xmath84 . note that when contributions from operators proportional to the quark mass or from twist-3 operators are ignored , the third of these relations is equivalent to the wandzura - wilczek relation @xcite @xmath86 in what follows we shall ignore terms directly proportional to the quark mass , as the masses of the @xmath87 and @xmath88 quarks are zero ( or very small ) in the mit bag model .",
    "( if this discussion were extended to include strange quarks and anti - quarks then it would be important to keep terms in the quark mass . )",
    "we can invert the moments above to find the genuine twist-3 parts of each distribution in terms of the calculated distributions and the twist-2 distributions @xmath89 this separation makes it possible to evolve the calculated distributions @xmath90 from the model scale up to experimental scales .",
    "the procedure i use for the evolution is to separate the calculated distributions at the model scale @xmath91 into twist-2 and twist-3 parts using eqn .",
    "( [ eq : t3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "the twist-2 parts are then evolved using the gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( glap ) equation @xcite to leading order , whereas the twist-3 parts are evolved according to naive power counting @xmath92 .",
    "the model scale has been chosen as @xmath93 gev , and in figure 2 the full twist-3 distributions at @xmath0 = 1 and 10 gev@xmath94 are shown .",
    "comparing between @xmath95 , which has no twist-2 part , and @xmath96 and @xmath97 enables us to see how the twist-2 parts of the latter two distributions dominate at higher @xmath0 .",
    "in fact it is probably not a particularly good approximation to evolve @xmath95 according to naive power counting .",
    "while a calculation of the anomalous dimensions for the operators contributing to @xmath48 has yet to be done , we can surmise a few facts about the lowest moments , including that the lowest moment of @xmath48 will have a small anomalous dimension despite the corresponding operator being twist-3 .",
    "the relevant local operators for @xmath48 in the operator product expansion are @xmath98 where @xmath99 symmetrizes over the lorentz indices @xmath100",
    ". the relevant matrix elements of these operators are @xmath101 standard techniques give the sum rules @xmath102 in particular , for @xmath103 we have @xmath104 which is related to the nucleon @xmath105 term , @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath105 term is renormalization point invariant in qcd , which implies that the matrix element in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : e0 ] ) will have an anomalous dimension of the same magnitude as that of the quark mass operator .",
    "thus the zeroth moment of @xmath48 will change quite slowly with @xmath0 , whereas we expect that the higher moments should scale approximately as @xmath107 .",
    "thus the distribution @xmath108 will tend to increase at low @xmath52 and decrease at high @xmath52 as @xmath0 increases .",
    "@xcite which confirms these speculative remarks , in particular the anomalous dimensions of the operators corresponding to the second and third moments of @xmath109 are similar in magnitude to the anomalous dimensions of twist-2 distributions . ]    at twist-4 level there is no mixing of twist-2 and twist-3 operators with the local twist-4 operators @xcite , which simplifies the analysis somewhat .",
    "of course there are a large number of local operators of twist-4 for each distribution function , and in the vast majority of cases their anomalous dimensions have not been calculated .",
    "thus to evolve the twist-4 distributions @xmath110 naive power counting , @xmath111 is again used . in figure 3",
    "we see the twist-4 distributions at @xmath112 1 and 10 gev@xmath94 , where again the bag scale has been taken as @xmath93 gev .",
    "finally , the twist - two transversity distribution @xmath113 will be of interest at scales above 1 gev@xmath94 .",
    "the anomalous dimensions of the twist-2 operators have been calculated @xcite , so the evolution of the parton distribution from the bag scale is fairly straightforward .",
    "the results of this evolution up to @xmath114 gev@xmath94 and @xmath115 gev@xmath94 are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the parton distribution functions calculated above can be measured in various processes , most notably deep inelastic lepton - nucleon scattering ( dis ) and drell - yan ( dy ) processes . in this section",
    "we consider how the parton distributions combine to give the nucleon structure functions which can be measured in dis , and those structure functions involving higher twist distributions which have been measured are compared with the calculated structure functions .    in the bjorken limit ( @xmath116 , @xmath117 fixed ) the nucleon tensor @xmath118 can be expressed in terms of 14 structure functions @xcite @xmath119 where the last seven structure functions ( @xmath120 ) are related to parity - violating processes involving the weak interaction .",
    "i have introduced the shorthand notation @xmath121 .",
    "it is conventional to introduce longitudinal structure functions , describing the scattering when the exchanged vector boson is longitudinally polarised @xmath122 according to the callen - gross relation @xcite both @xmath123 and @xmath124 vanish in the bjorken limit , and , ignoring qcd radiative corrections and nucleon mass effects , both are twist-4 structure functions .",
    "the fourteen structure functions can all be expressed in terms of parton distribution functions @xcite . in the following all contributions from parton distributions with two or more light - cone fractions ( ie distributions involving two quark fields plus one or two gluon fields and distributions involving four quark fields )",
    "will be dropped and the discussion is limited to the distributions calculated above .",
    "we also keep terms linear in the quark masses .",
    "the electroweak current @xmath125 of the quarks coupling to vector bosons is taken to be @xmath126 where the vector and pseudo - vector couplings , @xmath127 and @xmath128 take the values of the standard model . also ,",
    "because weak currents can change quark flavour , the mass of a quark in the initial state is denoted as @xmath129 , and the mass of a quark in the final state as @xmath130 .    for unpolarised scattering",
    "there are five measureable structure functions .",
    "@xmath131 and @xmath132 ( or @xmath123 ) describe electromagnetic scattering , @xmath133 is related to parity violating weak scattering , and @xmath134 and @xmath135 are related to the scattering of non - conserved currents .",

    "the twist-2 distribution @xmath140 is the longitudinally polarised analogue of @xmath133 , and if it were measured the role of the axial anomaly in the interpretation of measurements of @xmath141 would be much clearer@xcite .",
    "the structure functions @xmath142 are all twist-4 , with @xmath143 related to non - conserved currents .    for scattering from a transversely polarised nucleon",
    "there are four structure functions : @xmath144 these four structure functions are twist-3 .",
    "@xmath145 is related to the transverse spin of the quarks and antiquarks , @xmath146 is its parity - violating partner , while @xmath147 and @xmath148 are related to non - conserved currents .",
    "many experiments over the years have determined @xmath131 , @xmath133 and @xmath141 to good precision , and in the near future @xmath149 should be measured to similar precision .",
    "@xmath123 has also been measured to a lower degree of precision , thus it should be possible for us to extract estimates of the parton distributions @xmath2 and @xmath150 .",
    "unfortunately there is little hope of determining any of the other parton distributions from dis . from the expressions for @xmath151 , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : f4 ] , [ eq : f5 ] ) one might hope that @xmath48 would be measurable in heavy quark production .",
    "however because @xmath152 the terms in @xmath130 cancel . at hera",
    "] a similar cancellation occurs in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : g3 ] ) making a determination of @xmath113 very difficult . however the possibility exists to measure @xmath153 and @xmath48 in polarised drell - yan processes @xcite which may be possible at rhic .",
    "previous calculations @xcite have shown good agreement between experimental data for @xmath154 and @xmath155 and the model predictions .",
    "we are now in a position to compare the model prediction for @xmath156 with experimental data .",
    "experimentally the ratio @xmath157 has been measured @xcite , and there is good evidence for a twist-4 contribution @xcite at medium and high @xmath52 and @xmath158 gev@xmath94 . before we can compare with the data we should also take into account effects from perturbative qcd which give a non - zero @xmath123 at leading and next - to - leading order , and effects from the target nucleon mass . in the simplest version of the bag model the twist four contribution to @xmath159 for electromagnetic scattering",
    "is given by @xmath160 in figure 5 we show our calculated @xmath161 at @xmath162 and 5 gev@xmath94 .",
    "we also show the experimental values of @xmath159 and various perturbative qcd calculations , including target mass effects , and the effect of adding the twist-4 contribution from the bag model at these scales . because @xmath161 effectively scales as @xmath163",
    ", we calculate a large correction to the perturbative calculations at only low values of @xmath0 , however this twist-4 correction is in the right direction , and for low @xmath0 gives a good fit to the data at medium @xmath52 values .",
    "if the data at low @xmath0 improves in accuracy , it may be possible to perform an independent check on our value of the bag scale , @xmath70 , from a fit of our calculated parton distribution @xmath150 with the data at various values of @xmath0 .",
    "the other higher twist structure function that has been measured is @xmath164 @xcite . in figure 6 the experimental data for @xmath165",
    "is compared with the calculated structure function at @xmath166 gev@xmath94 .",
    "the calculation is in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "in particular the calculated @xmath167 crosses the @xmath52 axis in the right region . as this crossing",
    "is determined by the interplay between the twist-3 part of @xmath167 , given by @xmath168 and the twist-2 portion @xmath169 , this gives us some confidence in our understanding of the relations between the twist-2 and twist-3 distributions .",
    "it will be interesting to check our model calculations against experimental at other values of @xmath0 . as @xmath0 increases",
    "we predict that the crossing point @xmath170 where @xmath171 will move to larger @xmath52 .",
    "it is also interesting to note that while the bag model calculation for the structure function @xmath172 is not particularly good , presumably because the calculation does not include effects arising from the axial anomaly@xcite , in the case of @xmath165 the agreement with the data is better , probably because of the cancellation between the two terms in the twist-2 part of @xmath165 .",
    "finally in table 1 the calculated values for some of moments of the twist-2 and twist-3 parts of @xmath165 are displayed and compared with values from other calculations and those extracted from the experimental data .    before concluding ,",
    "there are some limitations to these calculations which should be borne in mind .",
    "there is no flavour dependence of the calculated parton distributions , so the distributions and structure functions shown above should be taken as applying to scattering from an isoscalar target . for our comparison of @xmath159",
    "this is not important , as experiment has shown no target dependence for @xmath159 @xcite , but for @xmath173 the flavour dependence will be as important as for @xmath141@xcite . in the model ,",
    "the flavour dependence of the parton distributions comes from the @xmath174 spin - flavour part of the wavefunction , and the one gluon exchange mechanism means that the two - quark intermediate state must be either a scalar ( s=0 ) or vector ( s=1 ) with masses @xmath175 and @xmath176 , respectively @xcite . furthermore no account has been taken of contributions to the parton distributions from intermediate states consisting of four quarks .",
    "however these contributions have only a small effect on valence distributions , and this is all in the small @xmath52 region @xcite , which is not of great importance here .",
    "an important correction to the parton distributions will come from mesonic contributions via the so - called sullivan process @xcite , where meson ( @xmath177 ) exchange between the virtual photon and the nucleon occurs .",
    "these processes are known to lead to important modifications in the parton distributions at twist-2 @xcite , particularly for @xmath73 , and there is no reason to suppose that the higher twist distributions should be unaffected .",
    "this should be important in the model calculation of the structure function @xmath173 .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the various parton distribution functions up to twist four in the context of the mit bag model .",
    "the discussion has been limited to those distributions involving two - quark correlation functions , however these include effects from the bag boundary , which is a simple model of the effects of the gluon field . from the twist-3 distributions , which involve quark - gluon correlations , we have calculated the twist-3 structure function , @xmath167 , and found the calculation in good agreement with the experimental data , which gives us some confidence in using the bag as a model of the quark - gluon dynamics involved in dis .",
    "four - quark correlation functions are expected to be small as they involve the calculation of hill - wheeler - type overlap functions for four quarks in the bag .",
    "also these distributions are not directly accessible to experiment .",
    "however in future work we shall look at the corrections four - quark distributions make to the two - quark distributions calculated here .    at twist - four",
    "we have seen that the calculated distribution @xmath49 gives a contribution to the experimentally measured @xmath178 .",
    "when added to the contributions from perturbative qcd and target mass effects , the calculation gives good agreement with the data at @xmath179 gev@xmath94 an dmedium values of @xmath52 .",
    "some improvements can be made to our calculations .",
    "on the model side we can add flavour dependence to our distributions , and we can also add the important effects of the pion cloud . also we can improve our evolution techniques for the distribution functions . for the twist-2 distributions next - to - leading - order qcd corrections are available . at twist-3",
    "there have been recent developments in the calculations of anomalous dimensions of the relevant operators , so that a correct leading order qcd approach is possible , though this will be very difficult .",
