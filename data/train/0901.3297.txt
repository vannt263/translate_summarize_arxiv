    "we consider a continuum model of drainage through a porous medium in @xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) , which we first describe informally .",
    "let @xmath6 be the canonical orthonormal basis of @xmath1 .",
    "we distinguish the @xmath7 direction and suppose that ` gravity ' acts in direction @xmath8 ; in free space , liquid would fall in exactly the @xmath8 direction .",
    "informally , consider a unit @xmath0-cube , representing a block of porous material .",
    "we scatter a certain finite set @xmath9 of points in this cube , representing special sites in the medium .",
    "we constrain liquid to drain in channels that visit every site and travel in straight lines from site to site .",
    "the vectors of each channel must have a non - positive component in the @xmath7 direction ; that is , they must respect gravity .",
    "the collection of channels spanning @xmath9 satisfying these conditions we call a _ drainage network _ on @xmath9 .",
    "a natural question is to find the most efficient arrangement of channels satisfying the above constraints , i.e. , a drainage network that is in some sense optimal .",
    "as we shall see , an answer to this question is a version of the so - called _ minimal directed spanning tree _ ( mdst for short ) on the vertices @xmath9 .",
    "more mathematically , let @xmath9 be a finite point set in @xmath3 whose points have distinct @xmath0-th coordinates .",
    "we construct a directed graph on vertex set @xmath9 as follows .",
    "join each vertex @xmath10 by a directed edge to a euclidean nearest neighbour ( if one exists , and arbitrarily breaking any ties ) amongst those points @xmath11 such that @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the order on @xmath9 induced by the order on @xmath0-th coordinates : @xmath14 if and only if @xmath15 .",
    "we call the directed graph so constructed the mdst on @xmath16 : it is a mathematical solution to the problem of constructing a minimal - length drainage network on @xmath9 as informally described above .",
    "the subject of this paper is the mdst on @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a homogeneous poisson point process of intensity @xmath19 on @xmath3 .",
    "then ( with probability @xmath20 ) , @xmath18 is indeed a finite point set with distinct @xmath0-th coordinates so that the mdst is almost surely well - defined .",
    "we study the total power - weighted edge - length of the mdst on @xmath21 as @xmath22 , and also the length of the longest edge .",
    "the mdst on @xmath21 is an example of a random spatial graph , that is , a graph generated by scattering points randomly into a region of space and connecting them according to some prescribed rule .",
    "motivated in part by real - world networks with spatial content , such as communications networks ( including the internet ) , social networks , and physical networks , a substantial body of recent research has dealt with the large - sample asymptotic theory of such graphs .",
    "examples include the geometric graph , the nearest - neighbour graph , and the minimal - length spanning tree ( mst ) .",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "a feature that distinguishes the mdst considered here from other random spatial graphs is that the constraint on direction of the edges can lead to significant ( indeed , sometimes dominating ) boundary effects due to the possibility of long edges occurring near the lower boundary cube @xmath23 orthogonal to @xmath7 .",
    "another difference is the fact that there is no uniform upper bound on vertex degrees in the mdst .",
    "in general , the mdst can be defined on any finite partially ordered set in @xmath1 , as described in @xcite ; a survey of results on the random mdst is given in @xcite .",
    "examples considered previously are the ` cooridnate - wise ' ( or ` south - west ' ) partial ordering on point sets in @xmath24 @xcite or in @xmath3 @xcite , and the radial spanning tree @xcite on point sets in @xmath25 .",
    "also , laws of large numbers for the mdst on a class of partial orders of @xmath25 were given in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are concerned with the ` south ' partial order @xmath13 , which is even a total order , on point sets in @xmath1 with distinct @xmath0-coordinates . our main results , theorems [ llnthm ] and [ mainth ] , give laws of large numbers , convergence of expectation , and distributional convergence results for the total power - weighted edge - length of the mdst on @xmath21 for @xmath2 .",
    "we also give a convergence result for the maximum edge - length in the mdst ( theorem [ dickman ] ) .",
    "our main distributional limit result , theorem [ mainth ] , reveals two regimes of limit behaviour for the total power - weighted edge - length depending on the power - weighting , in which the limit law is either purely normal or given in terms of boundary effects characterized as distributional limits of certain _ on - line nearest - neighbour graphs_. at a critical point between these two regimes , there is a phase transition at which both effects contribute significantly to the limit law . in order to understand the boundary effects in the mdst , and its longest edge",
    ", we make use of the fact that near to the boundary , the mdst is well - approximated by a certain on - line nearest - neighbour graph .    in the on - line nearest - neighbour graph ( ong ) , each point after the first in a sequence of points arriving sequentially in @xmath1 is joined to its nearest neighbour amongst those points already present .",
    "the ong itself is of separate interest as a simple growth model for random networks , such as the world wide web graph ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the total power - weighted length of the ong has been studied in @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "the ong arises as a natural tool for studying the structure of the mdst near to the boundary ; we also prove a new result ( theorem [ ongmax ] ) on the length of the longest edge in the ong on uniform random points in @xmath3 .    in the particular case of the total weight of the mdst on @xmath17 when @xmath4 , which is one of the most natural cases , the boundary contributions to the total power - weighted edge - length limit laws can be characterized in terms the limiting distribution of the total weight of the one - dimensional ong ( centred as necessary ) .",
    "results from @xcite say that such a distribution is characterized by a distributional fixed - point equation .",
    "such fixed - point equations , and the ` divide and conquer ' algorithms from which they often arise , are also a subject of considerable recent interest ; see , for example ,  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , much of the motivating interest comes from the desire to further understand the interplay between stochastic geometry and distributional fixed points previously more commonly seen in the analysis of algorithms ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this relationship was first seen in our previous work @xcite on limit theorems for the length of the ` south - west ' mdst in the unit square .",
    "the present work adds to this by considering the ` south ' mdst , for which the fixed - point distributions which arise are different .",
    "we remain some way from having a full description of the limits for all possible partial orders , other shapes of domain and non - uniform densities .    in @xcite , only the case @xmath4 of the ` south - west ' mdst was studied . in the present paper",
    "we deal also with higher dimensions . with fairly straightforward modifications , the method used in @xcite",
    "could be adapted to prove the @xmath4 case of our theorem [ mainth ] below . however , at several points the proofs used in @xcite are not easily adapted to higher dimensions , and thus we have adopted different proofs ; sometimes these improve or extend ideas from @xcite and sometimes we use entirely different techniques .",
    "another difference is that @xcite made use of general results of penrose and yukich @xcite while in the present paper we instead use the results of penrose @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which are in several ways more convenient for the current application .",
    "thus the results of the present paper are of a similar ( albeit general - dimensional ) flavour to those in @xcite , but the proofs are different .    before describing our results in detail , we return to the question of motivation .",
    "general motivation for the mdst is as a model for a constrained optimal transport network ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as has been mentioned elsewhere",
    "( e.g.  @xcite ) , the mdst can be motivated by communications networks .",
    "however , in the present case the primary motivation is from drainage networks . from this point of view",
    ", our choice of ` south ' partial ordering seems the most natural , and the two most natural choices of @xmath0 are @xmath4 and @xmath26 . for further references on the mathematical modelling of drainage networks , and a related infinite lattice version of this model , for which rather different properties were studied , see @xcite ; for background on modelling of drainage networks in general ,",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "in this section we give formal definitions of our model and state our main results .",
    "let @xmath27 .",
    "let @xmath9 be a finite subset of @xmath1 endowed with the binary relation @xmath13 , for which @xmath14 if and only if @xmath15 .",
    "assume that all the elements of @xmath9 have distinct @xmath28-coordinates . under this assumption",
    ", @xmath13 is a partial order on @xmath9 ( in fact , a total order ) , and so the mdst that we shall construct fits into the theory of the mdst on partially ordered sets given in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the cardinality ( number of elements ) of the set @xmath9 .",
    "a _ minimal element _ , or _ sink _ , is a vertex @xmath10 for which there exists no @xmath30 such that @xmath12 .",
    "thus under our definition of @xmath13 and our assumption on @xmath9 , there is a unique sink having strictly minimal @xmath28-coordinate and which we shall denote @xmath31 .    for a vertex @xmath32",
    ", we say that @xmath30 is a _ directed nearest neighbour _ ( in the @xmath13-sense ) of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath9 if @xmath12 and @xmath34 here and subsequently @xmath35 denotes the euclidean norm on @xmath1 . for each @xmath32",
    "let @xmath36 denote a directed nearest neighbour of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath9 , chosen arbitrarily if @xmath33 has more than one directed nearest neighbour .",
    "a minimal directed spanning tree ( mdst ) on @xmath16 , or simply ` on @xmath9 ' from now on , is a directed graph with vertex set @xmath9 and edge set @xmath37 .",
    "that is , there is an edge from each point other than the sink to a directed nearest neighbour .",
    "hence , ignoring the directedness of the edges , an mdst on @xmath9 is a tree rooted at the sink @xmath31 . note that an mdst is also a solution to a global optimization problem ( see @xcite )  that is , find a minimal - length spanning tree ( ignoring directedness of the edges ) such that each vertex is connected to the sink by a unique directed path , where directed edges must respect @xmath13 .     on 50 simulated uniform random points in @xmath24 ( left ) and @xmath38 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=40.0% ]   on 50 simulated uniform random points in @xmath24 ( left ) and @xmath38 ( right).,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    for @xmath39 with @xmath40 ,",
    "let @xmath41 denote the euclidean distance from a non - minimal @xmath10 to a directed nearest neighbour @xmath42 under @xmath13 and set @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath27 and @xmath44 , define the total power - weighted edge - length of the mdst on @xmath9 by @xmath45 where an empty sum is @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , @xmath47 is the total euclidean length of the mdst on @xmath9 . also , define the centred version @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "from now on we will take @xmath9 to be a _",
    "random _ point set in @xmath3 . in particular , we will take a homogeneous poisson point process @xmath18 of intensity @xmath49 on @xmath3 .",
    "note that in this random setting , each point of @xmath18 almost surely has a unique @xmath28-coordinate and at most one directed nearest neighbour under @xmath13 , so that @xmath18 has a unique mdst , which is rooted at @xmath50 .",
    "we state and prove all of our main results in the present paper for the poisson process @xmath18 . in all cases , the authors believe that analogous results hold for the binomial point process consisting of @xmath49 independent uniform random points on @xmath3 instead ; it should be possible to use standard de - poissonization arguments ( such as applied in similar circumstances in @xcite ) to verify this .    in the present paper we are concerned with @xmath2 .",
    "when @xmath51 , @xmath13 coincides with the coordinatewise partial order @xmath52 ( and indeed the total order @xmath53 on @xmath54 ) and so our ` south ' mdst is the same as the ` south - west ' mdst here .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 is a sum of powers of spacings of uniform points , and it can be studied using standard dirichlet spacings results ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . for instance , darling ( see @xcite , p.  245 ) essentially gives a central limit theorem for the binomial point process analogue of @xmath55 . from now on we fix @xmath56 .",
    "our first result describes the first - order behaviour of @xmath57 as @xmath22 .",
    "in particular , we have a law of large numbers for @xmath58 , and also asymptotic results for the expectation when @xmath59 . in @xmath4 ,",

    "in particular , for @xmath71 @xmath72    one can generalize the statement of theorem [ llnthm](i ) to more general point processes under certain conditions ; see @xcite for a general framework .",
    "our second main result ( theorem [ mainth ] , below ) presents convergence in distribution results for @xmath57 ; the distributional limits contain gaussian random variables and also random variables defined as distributional limits of certain on - line nearest - neighbour graphs ( see section [ secong ] ) .",
