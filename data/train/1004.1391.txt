    "in the past decades , there has been great interest in understanding and modelling different processes for information diffusion in a population .",
    "most of the time , the mathematical theory of epidemics is adapted for this purpose , even though there are differences between the process of spreading information and the process of spreading a virus or a disease . in the standard versions of the models , the most noticeable differences are between the way spreaders cease to spread an item of information and the way infected individuals",
    "are removed from epidemic processes .",
    "still , some slightly modified models fit both processes ( see , for example , @xcite , where the general stochastic epidemic model is considered as a model for the diffusion of rumours ) .",
    "@xcite recently introduced a model using a complete graph in which , as soon as an individual is infected , an anti - virus is given to that individual in such a way that the next time a virus tries to infect it , the virus is ineffective . besides , a virus can survive up to @xmath1 individuals empowered with anti - virus .",
    "individuals are represented by the vertices of the complete graph , while the virus is represented by a moving agent that replicates every time it hits a healthy individual .",
    "the authors prove a weak law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the proportion of infected individuals after the process is completed .",
    "there are two classical models for the spreading of a rumour in a population , which were formulated by @xcite and @xcite . in the model proposed by @xcite ,",
    "a closed homogeneously mixing population experiences a rumour process .",
    "three classes of individuals are considered : ignorants , spreaders and stiflers .",
    "the rumour is propagated through the population by directed contact between spreaders and other individuals , which are governed by the following set of rules .",
    "when a spreader interacts with an ignorant , the ignorant becomes a spreader ; whenever a spreader contacts a stifler , the spreader turns into a stifler and when a spreader meets another spreader , the initiating spreader becomes a stifler . in the last two cases",
    ", it is said that the spreader was involved in a _ stifling experience_. observe that the process eventually ends ( when no more spreaders are left in the population ) .",
    "we show how the techniques used by @xcite in the context of epidemic models can be useful in studying a general rumour process .",
    "in particular , we propose a generalization of the maki - thompson model . in our model",
    ", each spreader decides to stop propagating the rumour right after being involved in a random number of stifling experiences .    to define the process ,",
    "consider a closed homogeneously mixing population of size @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 be a nonnegative integer valued random variable with distribution given by @xmath4 for @xmath5 , and let @xmath6>0 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] . assign independently to each initially ignorant individual a random variable with the same distribution as @xmath3 .",
    "once an ignorant hears the rumour , the value of @xmath3 assigned to him determines the number of stifling experiences the new spreader will have until he stops propagating the rumour .",
    "if this random variable equals zero , then the ignorant joins the stiflers immediately after hearing the rumour .    for @xmath8",

    "notice that the infinite - dimensional process @xmath16 is a continuous time markov chain with increments and corresponding rates given by @xmath17 & ( 0,-1,0,0,\\dots ) & & \\left(n - x\\right ) y_1 .",
    "& & \\end{aligned}\\]]we see that the first case indicates the transition of the process in which a spreader interacts with an ignorant and the ignorant becomes a stifler immediately ( which happens with probability  @xmath18 ) .",
    "the second case indicates the transition in which a spreader interacts with an ignorant and the ignorant becomes a spreader of type @xmath9 ( which happens with probability @xmath19 ) .",
    "the third case represents the situation in which a spreader of type  @xmath9 is involved in a stifling experience but remains a spreader ( of type @xmath20 ) , and finally the last transition indicates the event that a spreader of type @xmath21 is involved in a stifling experience , thus becoming a stifler .",

    "our main purpose is to establish limit theorems for the proportion @xmath28 of ignorants at the end of the process . for the classical maki - thompson model , this problem",
    "was first studied rigorously by @xcite , who proved , by using martingale arguments , that this proportion converges in probability to @xmath29 .",
    "this result was later generalized by @xcite using the normal asymptotic approximation .",
    "@xcite derived the exact joint distribution of the final number of people who heard the rumour and the total personal time units during which the rumour was spread . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors present an analysis of the proportion of the population who never hear the rumour starting from a general initial condition .",
    "see also chapter  5 of @xcite for an excellent account of rumour models .",
    "the approach used to prove our theorems is the theory of density dependent markov chains , presented in  @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this technique is used for the first time in the context of rumour models here and in @xcite . in that paper , the authors study a family of rumour processes which includes the classical daley - kendall and maki - thompson models as particular cases .",

    "thus , given that a spreader has not yet stopped propagating the rumour , the conditional distribution of the additional number of stifling experiences he will have does not depend on how many stifling experiences he already had .",

    "see lemma  3.6 in  @xcite for an analogous detailed proof .      to prove both theorems , we use theorem 11.4.1 of  @xcite .",
