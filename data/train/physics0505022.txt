    "there are several theoretical equations for the dynamics of the magnetization @xmath10 of a ferrofluid that is flowing with velocity @xmath11 in an externally applied magnetic field @xmath12 @xcite . here",
    "we compare their predictions for a simple special case that is experimentally accessible .",
    "we consider a ferrofluid cylinder of radius @xmath13 of sufficiently large length to be approximated as infinite in a homogeneous applied field @xmath14 in @xmath15-direction .",
    "the ferrofluid cylinder is enforced via its walls to rotate as a rigid - body around its long axis with constant rotation frequency @xmath16 being oriented perpendicular to @xmath12 .",
    "the flowfield is thus @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the unit vector in azimuthal direction .",
    "in such a situation all aforementioned models allow for a spatially and temporally constant nonequilibrium magnetization @xmath3 that is rotated out of the directions of @xmath12 and @xmath4 by the flow .",
    "the maxwell equations demand that the fields @xmath4 and @xmath3 within the ferrofluid are related to each other via @xmath19 as indicated schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : vectors ] and that the magnetic field outside the ferrofluid cylinder @xmath20 is a superposition of the applied field @xmath12 and the dipolar contribution from @xmath3 .",
    "the model equations that we compare here imply a relaxational dynamics either of @xmath3 towards the equilibrium magnetization @xmath21 or of the `` local equilibrium '' or `` effective '' field @xmath22 towards the internal field @xmath4 .",
    "the equilibrium magnetization @xmath23 referring to the functional relation between internal field @xmath24 and magnetization in the case of @xmath25 is a thermodynamic material property of the ferrofluid .",
    "the effective field @xmath26 lies parallel to @xmath3 and can be seen as the inverse of the defining requirement @xmath27 in equilibrium , @xmath25 , one has @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "we consider here the relations @xmath30 resulting for the rotating cylinder from the above 5 models .",
    "in ml we use the weak field variant of ref .",
    "these equations have to be solved numerically in combination with the maxwell equation ( [ pg1 ] ) .    as an aside we mention that the above equations can be written in the common form @xmath31 with coefficients :    debye = = @xmath32 = , = @xmath33 = , = @xmath34 + s72 @xmath32 = , = @xmath33 , @xmath35 + s01 @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 + fk @xmath38 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 + ml @xmath39 , @xmath37 , @xmath34",
    "in order to make the comparison of the theoretical results easier we replace the equilibrium magnetization @xmath40 by the langevin expression @xmath41 with the initial susceptibility @xmath42 .",
    "we use @xmath43 and @xmath44 for the saturation magnetization which is appropriate for the ferrofluid apg 933 of ferrotec .",
    "the resulting curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ meq - h ] .",
    "furthermore , we replace the relaxation time @xmath45 by @xmath46 . for @xmath47",
    "we use the values @xmath48 and @xmath49 and for @xmath50 we use @xmath51 @xcite . for the parameter @xmath52 of ml @xcite",
    "we investigate two different choices : either the low - field variant , @xmath53 , as in fk that is denoted here by ml(f ) . or the variant @xmath54 $ ] as in s01 that is denoted here by ml(s ) .    especially the perpendicular component @xmath55 of the magnetic field is suited for a comparison of the different models with each other and with experiments . before doing the former we should like to draw the attention to the frequency behavior of @xmath56 .",
    "we mentioned already that @xmath57 vanishes for zero vorticity , @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , one finds that @xmath57 as well as @xmath59 vanishes also in the limit @xmath60 . and since one can rewrite the solution of eq.([pg4 ] ) in the form @xmath61 one sees that @xmath62 has a maximum as a function of @xmath7 as in fig .",
    "[ hy - om ] .",
    "there we show @xmath63 versus @xmath7 .",
    "the differences in the results for the different models are easily captured by comparing their predictions for the maximum values of @xmath64 , the locations of these maxima at @xmath65 , and the initial slopes @xmath66 at @xmath67 , each as a function of applied field @xmath68 .",
    "this is done in fig .",
    "[ fig : extrema ] .",
    "the maximal values of @xmath64 of debye and s72 are the same while their locations , @xmath65 , differ .",
    "the models s01 , fk , and ml formulated in terms of the effective field also share a common maximal value of @xmath64 being larger than that of debye and s72 while the location , @xmath65 , differ partly substantially .",
    "hence the magnetic torque , @xmath69 , entering into s72 , fk , and s01 only shifts the frequency @xmath65 .",
    "it remains to be seen whether experiments can be performed with sufficient accuracy to discriminate between the different theoretical predictions .",
