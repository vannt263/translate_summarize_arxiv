    "grbs are the most energetic explosions in the universe which result from deaths of stars in special ways .",
    "their enormous energy output ( @xmath1 ) produces very bright afterglows in uv / optical / nir which can be followed up using moderate - sized ground - based telescopes to understand the nature and the origin of grb and the emission mechanisms of the afterglow .",
    "the bright afterglows serve as a useful tool to understand the distant universe since they could be observed beyond @xmath2 , deep into the re - ionization epoch .",
    "they offer valuable information on the re - ionization state and the dust origin in the early universe , as well as the metal enrichment history over the cosmic time . in korea",
    ", we started a grb follow - up observation from 2007 october @xcite .",
    "initially , we focused on the study of the early universe using grbs as bright probes , but the program evolved over the time , expanding the facilities and the scientific scope of our studies . here , we describe our grb follow - up observation activities .",
    "figure 1 and table 1 summarize the facilities used by our group for the grb afterglow observation .",
    "the facilities are scattered around the world , allowing round - the - clock observation of grb afterglows .",
    "emphasis is given to nir imaging to study high redshift grbs , with the imagers equipped with nir filters ( at least @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "three facilities are the observational facilities of our group at ceou / snu .",
    "we have regular access to the ukirt and its wide - field nir imager , wfcam , for about 20 - 50 nights per year .",
    "we installed snucam @xcite , an optical imager , on the 1.5 m telescope of the maidanak observatory , uzbekistan , and it has been used for grb observations since 2006 .",
    "recently , we started using an optical ccd camera , cquean ( camera for quasars in the early universe ) for the 2.1 m telescope in mcdonald observatory @xcite .",
    "in addition , we are regular users of the 1.8 m telescope at boao , 0.6 m telescope at soao , and 1.0 m telescope at loao , all of which are operated by the korea astronomy & space science institute ( kasi ) .",

    "the grb follow - up activities have been ongoing since the observation of our first target , grb 071010b @xcite .",
    "we have been observing about 10 grbs per semester , and most of the observations have been reported in the gcn circulars .",
    "the grb observation activity using the loao 1-m telescope is described in detail in @xcite , and our activity follows this framework .",
    "we describe below a few grb studies to highlight our activity .",
    "this grb was observed on 2011 october 25/26 using loao 1-m telescope .",
    "we took @xmath6 images starting from 20 minutes after the bat alert .",
    "it is found that grb 071025 is a dust - reddened grb at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "we were the first group to report its high redshift nature , based on a red color of @xmath8 mag @xcite ( figure 2 ) .",
    "analysis of its spectral energy distribution ( sed ) suggests that the dust originates from a core - collapse supernova .",

    "we obtained optical imaging data at loao and maidanak , which were used to constrain the physical parameters and the emission mechanism of the burst @xcite .",
    "grb 090423a is currently the most distant grb with spectroscopic redshift at @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we followed up this object in @xmath11 using loao and maidanak facilities , and derived @xmath4-band field calibration data which were useful for unveiling the high redshift nature of the burst @xcite .",
    "grb 100905a was observed at ukirt in @xmath12 , 15 minutes after the bat alert @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the nir photometry data reveals a sharp break between @xmath3-band and @xmath13-band data , suggesting that this is a very high redshift grb at @xmath14 .",
    "this burst appeared on the christmas night of 2010 .",
    "it had an unusually very long burst duration , and exotic behavior in the x - ray and the optical light curves .",
    "we observed the burst in @xmath15 using cquean on the mcdonald 2.1 m telescope , 0.3 days after the bat alert or shortly after the observers finishing their christmas dinner .",
    "a comprehensive analysis including our data suggests that this is a new kind of grb whose afterglow is dominated by a black - body , created in a he star - neutron star merger @xcite .",
    "swift j1644 + 57 was discovered on 2011 march 28 as a grb with a very long burst duration .",
    "soon , it was realized that this is not a grb , but a very interesting phenomenon occurring at the center of a galaxy at @xmath16 .",
    "we performed extensive follow - up observations in nir and optical using all of our follow - up facilities .",
    "a multi - wavelength analysis of the data led to a conclusion that the onset of swift j1644 + 57 was caused by a jet - emission from a tidal disruption event where a star came too close to a supermassive black hole with @xmath17 at the center of the host galaxy @xcite .",
