    "thermal denaturation , i.e. separation of the two strands as a result of heating , is one of the oldest established physico - chemical results pertaining to the dna molecule . the melting- of dna was first observed @xcite very soon after the determination of the double helical structure .",
    "theoretical descriptions in the sixties , proposed by poland and scheraga ( ps ) @xcite , largely based on the concept of the helix - coil transition @xcite , were subsequently refined and developed in considerable detail , incorporating known enthalpic data on controlled oligomer thermodynamics and , when combined with appropriate software , can claim significant predictive power in regard to actual experimental melting profiles @xcite .",
    "helix - coil models adopt a mesoscopic description of dna , describing the open ( coil ) or closed ( helix ) state of an individual base pair in terms of a discrete , ising - type variable . by virtue of their construction",
    "they can not describe any dynamic phenomena .",
    "an interesting alternative was proposed two decades ago by peyrard , bishop and dauxois ( pbd ) @xcite . in accordance with contemporary soft mode concepts related to structural phase transitions , they attempted a reduced , also mesoscopic , lattice - dynamics motivated description of the double helix . in their case ,",
    "the relevant degree of freedom is a transverse displacement which represents how far an individual base pair is from equilibrium .",
    "this is locally determined by a nonlinear ( typically morse - like ) potential which accounts for the effective hydrogen bonding linking bases together .",
    "the motion of neighboring base pairs is coupled in a way which favors double - helical ordering ( dna stacking interaction ) .",
    "as it turns out , this minimal nonlinear lattice - dynamics ( also proposed in the context of wetting phenomena @xcite ) generates one of the simplest known one - dimensional models with short - range interactions which exhibit an exact phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the pbd model of dna does more than a demonstration of principle \" regarding the denaturation transition . as shown by cule and hwa @xcite the randomness introduced by base - pair heterogeneity results in a structured rounding of the transition ( multistep melting ) in qualitative accordance with experimental observation .",
    "recently , using improved computational methods and a new , global set of model parameters , it has been possible to compute detailed , multipeak melting profiles of long dna chains using only sequence information and salt concentration as input ; although further parameter optimization is probably needed , agreement with experiment is impressive @xcite . the model has also been used to calculate neutron scattering structure factors , also in very good agreement with recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as will be noted in this work , the low - frequency optical phonons of the model are in the range where raman spectroscopy has located some vibrational activity in dna @xcite .",
    "important issues remain open .",
    "one of the key advantages of the pbd approach is its potential ability to describe local openings ( denaturation bubbles \" ) of the double helix , such as those known to occur during the initial stage of the transription process .",
    "the relatively slow dynamics involved in these events would be consistent with the coarse graining implicit in the model .",
    "bubble statistics has been extensively studied in the framework of the pbd model , and some specific correlation with transcription initiation sites has in fact been claimed@xcite and debated @xcite . on a more modest - and yet quite fundamental - level , the formation of a single bubble has been observed by studying the melting of specially designed oligomers @xcite . as the results reported here will show , although the process and its rough temperature dependence are correctly accounted for by the pbd model , important details , notably the asymmetric biphasic character of the profile , are missing .",
    "this may be due to the fact that the global parameter set used in pbd modeling is either ( i ) not yet fully optimized or ( ii ) lacking in detail , e.g. in not taking proper account of the variations in stacking interaction between different sets of neighboring base pairs .    the paper is structured as follows : section 2 describes the model and introduces system parameters to be used .",
    "section 3 presents thermodynamics , including some necessary background material , and focuses on ( i ) issues related to finite chains and ( ii ) heterogeneity .",
    "section 4 presents computed melting profiles for both long and short chains and compares theoretical vs. experimental results .",
    "section 5 discusses the statistical properties of extended objects , i.e. bubbles and clusters consisting , respectively , of consecutive open and bound base pairs .",
    "section 6 summarizes results and perspectives .",
    "i will use the version of the pbd model proposed in @xcite .",
    "the total potential energy of a chain of @xmath0 base pairs can be represented as a sum of local and nonlocal contributions @xmath1 where the transverse coordinate @xmath2 represents the separation of the two bases at the @xmath3th site , the local term , an on - site morse potential @xmath4 describes the combined effects of hydrogen - bonding , stacking and solvent acting on the @xmath3th base pair , and the anharmonic elastic term @xmath5(y_j - y_{j+1})^2 \\label{eq : stack}\\ ] ] models the nonlinear base - stacking interaction .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 describes the strength of the linear stacking interaction , i.e. the residual stacking which characterizes the disordered state .",
    "most of the stacking energy which favors values @xmath7 comes from the nonlinear term which is parametrized by its dimensionless strength @xmath8 and its range @xmath9 . in view of the very large ratio of double - stranded and single - stranded dna persistence lengths @xcite",
    ", a value of @xmath10 appears reasonable .",
    "a stacking interaction range @xmath11 is consistent with the double helical geometry ( diameter @xmath12 ) .",
    "the other parameters are the depth @xmath13 and the range @xmath14 of the morse potential .",
    "this work follows the choice of parameters made in @xcite , i.e. @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 where c is the molar salt concentration .",
    "it may be noted that although these particular parameters were derived by fitting melting profiles , the resulting optical frequencies ( with an effective mass per site equal to 618 amu ) are about @xmath19 @xmath20 for gt and @xmath21 @xmath20 for at .",
    "these values compare favorably with the results of low - frequency raman spectroscopy @xcite which identify a broad band below 85 @xmath20 .",
    "the thermodynamics of the model ( [ eq : ham ] ) is determined by the interplay between the elastic interaction and the morse potential . at low temperatures ,",
    "the displacements @xmath22 oscillate around the minima of the morse potential , @xmath23 ; phonon spectra have a gap . at high temperatures displacements",
    "are large , oscillations occur on the flat top of the morse potential , phonons are essentially gapless . as a result , thermodynamic properties are those of the harmonic chain .",
    "the classical partition function develops an infrared divergence , due to contributions from long - wavelength phonons .",
    "some consequences of this divergence are fairly trivial , e.g. the emergence of a divergent temperature - independent , entropic contribution .",
    "others , in particular when it comes to oligomers , are critical . in order to keep proper track of this divergence , i will introduce the size of the allowed phase space @xmath24 explicitly .",
    "the classical partition function of an open - ended chain with @xmath0 base pairs is thus defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath28 the system temperature .",
    "note that , because of the repulsive core of the morse potential , contributions to the partition function for negative displacements decay quite rapidly .",
    "thus , even though numerical computations always involve a lower cutoff @xmath29 of the integrations , if the cutoff is appropriately chosen , the values of the integrals remain practically independent of the particular value of that cutoff .",
    "a quantity which is of direct experimental interest is the fraction of bound ( or , respectively , open ) pairs .",
    "the microscopic average which is necessary to compute this is the probability that the @xmath30th base pair is bound , i.e. @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a - somewhat arbitrary - crossover distance which distinguishes open from bound base pairs .",
    "the calculations presented in this paper use a value @xmath33 a.    the fraction of open pairs is then given by @xmath34        in the homogeneous case @xmath35 the partition function can be calculated in terms of the spectra of the transfer integral equation , @xmath36 where @xmath37/2 }   \\label{eq : tikern}\\ ] ] will be used in this work as a reference kernel , and the eigenfunctions are normalized to unity .",
    "[ fig : eignum ] shows the numerically calculated lowest eigenvalues for different values of @xmath24 .",
    "the discretization of the integral equation was performed using gauss - legendre quadratures in the interval @xmath38 , where @xmath24 varies between @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the density of the mesh has been kept constant at @xmath41 points per a. the figure provides a numerical illustration of the existence of a well defined limit @xmath42 of the integral equation ( [ eq : ti ] ) .",
    "note in particular the rapid ( quadratic ) convergence of the successive numerical estimates of the critical temperatures to the limiting value .",
    "the partition function ( [ eq : z ] ) can be written in terms of the spectra of ( [ eq : ti ] ) as @xmath43 where the sum runs over all eigenstates , @xmath44 and the @xmath24-superscripts have been dropped from eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the sake of notational clarity .",
    "it should be understood that any eigenfunction and/or eigenstate is the result of a numerical calculation performed with a cutoff and on a grid .    the free energy per lattice site ( base pair )",
    "is given by @xmath45    \\quad .",
    "\\label{eq : fti}\\ ] ] the above form is useful because it illustrates important limiting behavior .      in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath46 , terms of order @xmath47 in ( [ eq : fti ] ) vanish .",
    "this kills all infrared - divergent terms and leaves only the contribution from the highest eigenvalue ; for that contribution however , the limit @xmath42 exists ( fig .",
    "[ fig : eignum ] ) .",
    "the singularity of the spectrum of ( [ eq : ti ] ) where the bound state merges into the continuum generates an infrared - free singularity of the thermodynamic properties of the infinite chain .",
    "the question of the order of the transition has been extensively discussed in the literature .",
    "the dichotomy between apparent ( first - order ) and exact limiting ( continuous ) behavior has been presented in some detail in the case of the helicoidal version of the pbd model@xcite . the distinction is generic and applies to the model used here as well .",
    "[ fig : n20 ] ( left panel ) shows numerical results for the free energy per site in the case @xmath48 .",
    "the transition is much more rounded , as would be expected from finite - size corrections .",
    "moreover , the infrared divergent terms are significant on a visible scale",
    ". the concomitant effect on the melting profile can be seen on the right panel .",
    "there is no sign of convergence of the melting curve ; as the inset indicates , the sequence of effective melting temperatures can not be used in a straightforward way to produce a limit .    ,      the difficulties encountered in the previous section would encourage the following fundamentalistargument regarding melting of any finite chains : since , for any finite @xmath0 , the integral in ( [ eq : nthbp ] ) remains finite in the limit @xmath42 , whereas the partition function diverges , @xmath49 should vanish at any nonzero temperature ; it would follow that @xmath50 for any @xmath51 .    how watertight is this formally correct proof \" ?    in order to make this quantitative , let me go back to the free energy function .",
    "suppose i would like the finite - size , infrared divergent corrections ( cf .",
    "[ fig : n20 ] ) to remain very small , e.g. @xmath52 where @xmath53 is some small number . on the other hand",
    ", one must note that the @xmath24 s used are not entirely arbitrary .",
    "@xmath24 must be large enough to ensure proper convergence of the ti equation ( [ eq : ti ] ) .",
    "for the set of parameters used here , it seems that values between 300 and 400 a should be sufficient .",
    "one may then argue that if , in addition , ( [ eq : criterion ] ) holds , the thermodynamic properties of the finite chain with values of @xmath24 in this order will be numerically stable , i.e. @xmath24-independent .",
    "what might happen at astronomicvalues of @xmath24 can have no practical bearing to dna melting .",
    "a typical choice of @xmath54 and @xmath55 a suggests that @xmath56 is a long enough chain to produce such numerically stable melting profiles within the pbd model .",
    "interestingly , this is in line with what model - independent estimates based on analyzing melting temperatures of natural dna classify as the limit of a long chain .",
    "this may however be too conservative a choice when it comes to pbd model considered here .",
    "[ fig : n100 ] shows that for @xmath57 the melting profiles are numerically stable in the sense described above and produce a linearly convergent sequence of melting temperatures .",
    "it is possible to define an infrared divergence - free thermodynamic average quantity by considering the conditional probability of any base pair being open , subject to the condition that the strands are not totally separated @xcite .",
    "the use of such a double stranded ensembleis standard procedure in analyzing dna melting profiles of oligomers in terms of statistical ( poland - scheraga type ) models , because there the theory is entirely formulated in terms of this conditional probability ( internal melting fraction ) .",
    "the probability of fulfilling this condition ( external melting fraction ) , which is necessary in order to analyze experimental data , must then be obtained or estimated by other means . within the pbd formalism",
    "the internal melting fraction can be calculated by first considering the ( infrared - divergent ) statistical weight corresponding to total melting , i.e. @xcite .",
    "@xmath58 the quantity @xmath59 expresses the probability that at least one base - pair is bound .",
    "the conditional probability @xmath60 that the @xmath30th base pair is bound , provided that the chain is not entirely open , substitutes @xmath61 for @xmath62 in the denominator of ( [ eq : nthbp ] ) and should be free of infrared divergences .",
    "the same should hold for the internal melting fraction @xmath63    fig .",
    "[ fig : n20dse ] illustrates the use of the double - stranded ensemble for oligomers .",
    "the dashed curves are repetitions of the melting profiles of fig for @xmath64 .",
    "the dotted curves represent @xmath65 in the two cases .",
    "the solid curves , which coincide , are the internal melting fractions @xmath66 .",
    "i will return to a constructive use of the double - stranded ensemble in section [ seq : short ] .        in the absence of translational invariance the partition function ( [ eq : z ] )",
    "must be calculated directly as an @xmath0-dimensional integral ; to do this in real - space , with a typical mesh of @xmath67 points ( which is what acceptable numerics demands , corresponding to an @xmath68 a ) is an almost impossible task for @xmath69 .",
    "this is not just a matter of computing time , but also of maintaining numerical accuracy .",
    "a useful alternative is to exploit the eigenfunction expansion of the reference ( at ) kernel @xmath70 in order to transform the @xmath0-dimensional integration in real space to a matrix multiplication in a restricted eigenfunction space , e.g. by demanding that the @xmath71 summation be restricted to those states which satisfy @xmath72 . using the auxiliary quantities @xmath73 where @xmath74 if @xmath3 is a gc site and 0 if @xmath3 is an at site , it is straightforward to rewrite the partition function as @xmath75 or , in more compact matrix notation , @xmath76 computing the probability of the @xmath30th base pair being in the bound state involves transforming the numerator of ( [ eq : nthbp ] ) in a similar fashion .",
    "i use script letters to define vector components similar to ( [ eq : vectordefs ] ) , with an upper limit equal to @xmath32 , i.e. @xmath77 and similarly for @xmath78 .",
    "then @xmath79      computing @xmath49 for all sites involves heavy duplication of matrix multiplications .",
    "it is computationally much more efficient to define , compute and store intermediate results in vector form .",
    "moreover , it is necessary to renormalize vectors to unity at every stage of a matrix - vector multiplication .",
    "the latter procedure minimizes numerical error because it keeps computed scalar products in the order of unity .",
    "let the unit vectors at the ends be defined via @xmath80 where the @xmath81 s are the norms of the respective unnormalized vectors .",
    "i then store the result of each successive matrix - vector multiplication in vector form , as a unit vector and a norm , i.e. @xmath82 it then follows that ( i ) @xmath83 for any choice of @xmath84 , and ( ii ) @xmath85 computing and storing the necessary intermediates for a melting profile of a chain with @xmath0 base pairs in vector form is a process with @xmath86 computational steps .",
    "the procedure described in the previous sections has been used @xcite to compute melting profiles of large genomic sequences . as an example",

    "( [ eq : datpred ] ) .    in order to relate melting profiles to sequence details ,",
    "it is customary to draw a melting map , in which each site is characterized by its melting temperature , defined via @xmath87 .",
    "the melting map for the t7 phage is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : t7map ] , along with the moving 200-pt average of local gc - content .",
    "two comments are in order here . first the obvious .",
    "genomic heterogeneity destroys the sharp first order transition characteristic of the homogeneous pbd model ( and of actual melting profiles of long polynucleotide chains ) .",
    "remnants of multistep melting can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : t7map ] , which suggests melting of 200-bp chunks .",
    "this is in general accord with theoretical expectations on the effect of disorder on phase transitions ( reduction of effective dimensionality , hence enhancement of the role of fluctuations , rounding of an incipient transition ) . on the other hand , in an interesting analysis of the effects of heterogeneity within the pbd model context",
    ", it has been argued @xcite that multistep behavior should be self - averaging , albeit with a large crossover length .",
    "i have not detected any systematic signs of self - averaging , even in genomic sequences of much larger lengths than the one presented here .",
    "the second comment concerns the change in entropy .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : t7map ] shows the dependence of the entropy derivative on temperature ( right y - scale ) .",
    "the curve is almost perfectly superimposed on the melting profile .",
    "the total entropy change , @xmath88 per base pair , is considerable smaller than the typical experimental values @xcite of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 cal / mol / bp / k ) , but represents a considerable improvement from the @xmath91 obtained using previous parametrizations @xcite of the pbd model .",
    "an interesting example of a short chain is the @xmath92 sequence , which exhibits biphasic melting behavior at @xmath93 salt concentration @xcite .",
    "[ fig : l48 ] shows the ( @xmath24-dependent ) melting curves in the left panel .",
    "the curves were obtained using morse potential depths according to ( [ eq : datpred ] ) .",
    "the extracted sequence of melting temperatures ( inset , left panel ) is regular .",
    "melting behavior is of the single - phase type .",
    "this disagrees with experimentally observed behavior , which is not surprising ; it should be quite clear that physical separations of the two dna strands of the order of @xmath94 a should be totally irrelevant to the study a fluctuating 48-bp molecule ( which has a total length of 170 a ) .",
    "the obvious alternative within the context of the pbd model is the double - stranded ensemble ( cf .",
    "[ seq : dss ] ) .",
    "melting profiles are shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : l48 ] ; they are practically @xmath24-independent . in the same panel",
    "i have included an estimate ( dotted curve ) which mimics the experimentally observed @xmath95 @xcite , in terms of relative temperature position and width . making use of this estimate",
    "it is possible to calculate the total melting profile , which does indeed exhibit biphasic behavior .",
    "the differential melting curve is shown in the right panel , along with the corresponding experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in spite of this qualitative agreement",
    ", there are still considerable problems with the theoretical description of this exemplary case of biphasic melting in dna oligomers .",
    "first , the predicted peaks in the melting profiles lie more than 10 degrees higher than the experimentally observed ones .",
    "second , the predicted biphasic behavior is of the wrong type , i.e. melting accelerates at higher temperatures ( rather than slowing down , as experimentally observed ) .",
    "this may well signal a fundamental difficulty of describing oligomer melting behavior in terms of the pbd model .",
    "denaturation bubbles(here to be referred to in brief as bubbles ) are extended regions of space where the displacement exceeds the critical value @xmath32 .",
    "the probability of having a bubble of length @xmath6 at site @xmath30 is ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : pnmatr ] ) ) @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the complement of @xmath98 , i.e. @xmath99 and @xmath100 , i.e. this is a backward - counted , internal bubble . in terms of the stored unit vectors and norms of section [",
    "sec : heterotherm ] , this can be rewritten in the form @xmath101    note that a strict definition of a bubble should include the demand that the enclosing sites @xmath102 and @xmath103 should be occupied by bound base pairs .",
    "the probability for this to occur will be @xmath104 for very long chains , it is possible to average over all sites ( @xmath105 to exclude boundaries ) and obtain the site - averaged probability @xmath106 for the occurrence of a ( strictly ) size @xmath6 bubble somewhere along the chain .",
    "[ fig : sumschematic ] provides a schematic illustration of the sum rule @xmath107 in fact , as the figure suggests , the sum rule is valid also for the non - averaged probabilities , i.e. @xmath108 since the sequences shown exhaust all configurations in which the @xmath30th base pair is bound ( up ) .",
    "another quantity of interest is the density of neighboring bound / unbound pairs ( spin flips ) .",
    "going back to fig .",
    "[ fig : sumschematic ] it is straightforward to identify the flip density - which , owing to the topology of the one - dimensional chain , is equal to the average bubble density - with @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the joint probability of two successive sites being in the bound state ( the zero - size bubble ) .    the average size of a bubble can be defined as @xmath111    noting that the product of average bubble size and density is just the fraction of open base pairs leads to a second sum rule , @xmath112    the above sum rules ( [ eq : qsum1 ] ) and ( [ eq : qsum2 ] ) represent exact properties of the infinite chain .",

    "the figure includes known @xcite promoter sites for ( a very qualitative and at the present stage by no means systematic ) comparison .",
