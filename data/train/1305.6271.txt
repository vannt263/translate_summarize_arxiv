    "we consider the following minimization problem @xmath26 carrying the sobolev inequality @xmath27 holding for functions @xmath13 having zero mean value . since in general @xmath28 , in comparison with , we are trading the restriction to zero mean value functions for a better embedding constant . even in this case , scaling arguments enforce @xmath29 to be invariant under dilations and the present paper is devoted to the study of the optimal lower bound in the wake of and to a complete characterization of the optimal sets ( from now on called `` minimizers '' ) on which @xmath30 achieves the lower bound .    to this aim",
    "we rewrite @xmath31 in terms of geometric quantities , such as perimeters and measures of subsets of @xmath2 . for a given",
    "bounded open set @xmath2 we define @xmath32 and prove the following .",
    "[ reduction ] if @xmath2 is a bounded open set of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath33 , then @xmath34    taking advantage of , we are able to characterize the minimizers .",
    "astonishingly , the minimization is very sensitive to the choice of @xmath35 and @xmath3 .",
    "a symmetry breaking phenomenon appears above a threshold value of the exponent @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore for certain choices of @xmath35 and @xmath3 minimizers are not even unique .",
    "our main result is the following .",
    "[ maintheo ] for all @xmath36 every minimizer of @xmath31 in the class of bounded , open sets with given measure , is union of two disjoint balls .",
    "shape and uniqueness of such minimizers depends on @xmath35 and @xmath3 .",
    "more specifically , there exists @xmath371,1^\\ast[$ ] such that , when @xmath38 , the minimizer is unique and the two balls composing the minimizer have the same radius , while , when @xmath39 , the minimizer is unique and the two balls composing the minimizer have different radii .",
    "moreover :    1 .   if @xmath5 , then @xmath40 , the minimizer is unique even at @xmath41 and consists in the union of two disjoint balls with equal radii .",
    "2 .   for all @xmath6 ,",
    "then the minimizer is not unique at @xmath41 , indeed there are exactly two minimizers one of which is the union of two disjoint balls with equal radii .",
    "[ mainrem ] we point out some additional properties that will be deduced during the proof of the theorem [ maintheo ] .",
    "assume that we work with the class of bounded , open sets of given measure .",
    "when @xmath5 , the radii of the balls composing the unique minimizer change continuously for @xmath42 and the largest one is nondecreasing with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "the case @xmath6 shows some differences .",
    "bearing in mind that the exact value @xmath43 is not explicitly given , we can bound it from above and below by @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "more important , crossing the threshold value @xmath43 the minimizer abruptly jumps from two balls of equal radii to two balls of unequal radii . for @xmath46 minimizing pairs of balls of equal and unequal radii coexist . considering the minimizing pairs of unequal radii , for @xmath47",
    ", the radius of the largest ball continuously increases with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "+ finally , regardless the value @xmath48 the minimizing pair always degenerates to one ball as @xmath49 .",
    "a different point of view to look at our problem consists in considering the minimization in as relaxed form of @xmath50 in this case we can address to @xmath31 as the `` twisted eigenvalue '' of the @xmath51-laplacian or `` twisted cheeger constant '' , that means @xmath31 is the @xmath52 counterpart of the so - called twisted eigenvalue for the laplacian : @xmath53 to our knowledge the term `` twisted eigenvalue '' was first introduced by barbosa and brard in @xcite . later freitas and henrot in @xcite employed symmetrization arguments to show that the pairs of disjoint balls of equal radii are the unique minimizers of @xmath54 among all bounded , open sets of given measure .",
    "for the interested reader , generalization of the twisted laplacian eigenvalue in different directions have already been studied for instance in @xcite .    in the spirit of @xcite",
    ", one might expect that also minimizers for @xmath31 are pairs of disjoint balls of equal radii , and theorem [ maintheo ] contradicts this intuition .",
    "the picture that we get is much more similar to the one obtained for certain @xmath51-dimensional wirtinger inequality in @xcite where the occurrence of symmetric and asymmetric minimizers have been completely settled . in dimension",
    "greater than @xmath51 , symmetry breaking for @xmath55-laplacian twisted eigenvalue problems , for certain range of exponents , have been observed in an interesting remark by a. i. nazarov recently appeared in @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to show that it is possible to study problem by considering only test functions whose positive and negative parts are characteristic functions up to multiplicative factors .",
    "let us introduce the following notation .",
    "for any @xmath56 we set @xmath57 clearly , if as usual @xmath58 denotes the characteristic function of a set @xmath59 , recalling , @xmath60 we denote @xmath61 and we define @xmath62 first we prove that the infimum in is attained .",
    "the classical isoperimetric inequality implies that @xmath63 and , being @xmath64 , the right - hand side diverges as @xmath65 .",
    "hence , if @xmath66 is a sequence of couple of domains in @xmath67 which minimizes as @xmath68 , the sequences @xmath69 , @xmath70 are bounded in @xmath52 and , up to subsequences , strongly converge in @xmath71 . then the lower semicontinuity of the perimeter along these sequences guarantees that the infimum in is attained .",
    "now we show that @xmath72 . by choosing @xmath73 , with @xmath74",
    ", we have that @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath76 is an admissible test function in , and @xmath77 .",

    "@xmath85 implies that @xmath86 .",
    "let @xmath87 by the fubini theorem and the hlder inequality , we get that @xmath88 and the same relation holds for @xmath82 . using the above inequality",

    "we split the proof into two subsections . in the first one we prove that the minimum of @xmath31 among bounded , open sets of given measure is attained at the union of two disjoint balls . in the second subsection",

    "our minimization problem is @xmath146 and proposition [ bound ] implies that the study reduces to the study of a one - dimensional minimum problem .",
