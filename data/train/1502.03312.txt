    "in recent past there have been efforts based on single molecule experiments to elucidate the role of internal friction in protein folding @xcite .",
    "these single molecule experiments showed internal friction to play a significant role in folding especially when the protein starts with a more compact unfolded state . among the different types of experiments carried out to study the dynamics of the unfolded proteins ,",
    "the most common one is a combination of fret and nsfcs , where two residues @xmath0 and @xmath1 of a protein are labelled with fluorescence probes and the fluctuation of the distance between them is observed from the efficiency of energy transfer .",
    "an auto - correlation function is then calculated from the distribution , which eventually gives a characteristic relaxation time , also called the reconfiguration time ( @xmath2 ) @xcite . in another type of fluorescence experiment ,",
    "two different residues of a protein are again tagged with a fluorescence quencher and donor .",
    "the time required for the the donor to be quenched which happens only within a certain distance , gives an estimation of loop formation time ( @xmath3 ) in a protein @xcite .",
    "both the time scales , @xmath2 and @xmath3 seem to have a nonzero intercept when plotted against the solvent viscosity .",
    "this residual reconfiguration or looping time has been then attributed to  internal friction \" which is present within the protein and assumed to be independent of the solvent around .",
    "unfortunately a molecular picture of this internal friction is still lacking but it is believed that dihedral rotations , hydrogen bonding and other weak interactions contribute to internal friction .",
    "recent simulations on proteins support such propositions as well @xcite .",
    "this also tells why internal friction is more when the protein is in more compact unfolded state .",
    "though the notion of  internal friction \" is not very old in the physical chemistry community @xcite , it has always been a topic of research among polymer rheologists .",
    "for example rabin and ttinger looked at the origin of internal viscosity in a gaussian chain @xcite .",
    "following an idea of de gennes @xcite they derived an expression for the relaxation time , @xmath4 associated with internal viscosity as @xmath5 where , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the monomer size and chain the length respectively , @xmath9 is the flory exponent @xcite .",
    "therefore in the limit solvent viscosity @xmath10 , it has a non - zero intercept proportional to the internal viscosity @xmath11 .",
    "this is in the same spirit as that of khatri and mcleish @xcite , where a modified rouse model gives a mode relaxation time which is dependent on internal friction , @xmath12 .",
    "such a model gives a reconfiguration time between any two monomers @xmath0 and @xmath1 as @xmath13 @xcite , where @xmath14 is the rouse time , proportional to the solvent viscosity .",
    "although such a model qualitatively can predict the trend of the variation of reconfiguration time as a function of solvent viscosity and produce a non - zero intercept but can not account for the changes in  internal friction \" at different degrees of compactness encountered in experiments .",
    "it is expected that the protein experiences different level of  internal friction \" at different concentrations of the denaturant as the compactness of it changes .",
    "this can be seen from the plots of the reconfiguration time @xcite against the solvent viscosity at different denaturant concentrations where the intercepts gives the time scale due to  internal friction \" .",
    "the higher the denaturant concentration the smaller the intercept . in the present study",
    "we extend recently proposed models @xcite to include the effect of the compactness of the polymer chain to internal friction by introducing a confining harmonic potential to each monomer of the chain which accounts for the change in chain conformation due to denaturant . at lower denaturant concentration chain",
    "is more compact so the confining potential is steeper but as the denaturant concentration increases the confining potential becomes shallower . with this model , the looping dynamics",
    "is studied within wilemski fixman(wf ) framework @xcite assuming the polymer chain to be gaussian .",
    "loop formation between any two parts of a bio - polymer is supposedly the primary step of protein folding , dna cyclization @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that wf formalism seems to work fine here and has been used to calculate the same in presence of hydrodynamic interactions by chakrabarti @xcite and the effect of viscoelastic solvent @xcite .",
    "the method has also been used in the past extensively @xcite to investigate other aspects of the polymer looping problems .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "the details of the the polymer models are given in section @xmath15 .",
    "section @xmath16 deals with the methods . results and discussions",
    "are represented in section @xmath17 .",
    "section @xmath18 is the conclusion .",
    "in the rouse model , a polymer chain is imagined as a series of brownian particles connected by harmonic springs with no hydrodynamic interactions and excluded volume effect @xcite .",
    "if @xmath19 is the position of the @xmath20 monomer at time @xmath21 , where @xmath0 can be varied from @xmath22 to @xmath8 , then dynamics of rouse chain with @xmath23 monomers is described by the following equation of motion    @xmath24    where @xmath25 is the solvent viscosity and @xmath26 is the spring constant with kuhn length @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is the random force with moments    @xmath29    standard procedure to treat such a system is to describe the dynamics in the form of normal modes @xmath30    @xmath31    here , @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the relaxation time of @xmath35 mode is @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the slowest relaxation time @xmath38 is called rouse time .",
    "rouse model does not take into account the effects of hydrodynamic interactions .",
    "the simplest possible model which takes care of it , is due to zimm @xcite .",
    "it is possible to show that in @xmath39 condition under pre - averaged hydrodynamic interaction , the zimm chain can be described by the same eq .",
    "( [ eq : rouse - mode ] ) but with a different scaling of friction co - efficient with the mode number @xmath40 where , @xmath41 remains the same i.e. @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time of @xmath35 mode is @xmath43 and @xmath44 , is the slowest relaxation time or zimm time .    recently in polymer rheology community internal friction has been introduced within rouse description using a dashpot between the neighbouring monomers .",
    "this is commonly referred to as rouse with internal friction ( rif ) which has the following euation of motion    @xmath45    khatri and mcleish @xcite showed that above model can also be treated with normal mode description as is done with rouse chain . similarly a zimm chain with internal friction ( zif ) can be constructed . in",
    "both the models rif and zif , internal friction appears as an additive constant to the relaxation times of each normal modes @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the new relaxation time is @xmath47 where , @xmath48 .",
    "this is because of the redefined @xmath49 where @xmath50 remains unchanged , i.e. @xmath51 .    in rif and zif there is no scope to introduce the effect of denaturant concentration to the chain conformation .",
    "it is obvious that the more is the denaturant concentration , the less compact the chain is and the less is the internal friction . to incorporate such effect ,",
    "one possibility is to put all the monomers in a confining potential .",
    "this becomes analytically trackable when the confinement is harmonic .",
    "thus the restoring force acting on the @xmath20 monomer would be @xmath52 where , @xmath53 is the spring constant .",
    "similar models of polymers in confined potential has been used in other contexts too @xcite .",
    "this model is named as compacted rouse with internal friction ( crif ) .",
    "we would also like to mention that essentially the same model has recently been used to fit the simulated results @xcite .",
    "@xmath54    similarly zif can be extended to compacted zimm with internal friction ( czif ) .",
    "now , @xmath55 as well as @xmath56 are mode dependent because @xmath57 , but the friction coefficients associated with normal modes remain unchanged i.e. @xmath58 and @xmath59 . as a consequence ,",
    "the relaxation time for @xmath35 mode of this rouse chain is , @xmath60 and for this zimm chain in @xmath39 solvent under pre - averaged hydrodynamic interactions is @xmath61 .",
    "the time scale for the internal friction of crif as well as czif become identical @xmath62 . depending on the value of @xmath53 , mode number @xmath63 and the chain length",
    "two extreme situations can arise .",
    "for example if @xmath53 is small , chain is short ( small @xmath8 ) and @xmath64 , @xmath65 can be approximated as @xmath66 and then @xmath67 .",
    "same is true for zimm chain .",
    "this is expected as this corresponds to a very weak confinement of the chain where higher modes rarely contribute . on the other hand , if @xmath53 is large , then @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "therefore in such a situation @xmath53 controls the dynamics of the polymer and higher modes contribute more .",
    "all the parameters for rouse and zimm chain are depicted in table [ tablerouse ] and [ tablezimm ] respectively .",
    ".list of parameters for rouse , rif and crif [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the time correlation function of normal modes for rouse as well as zimm chain is given by the following equation @xcite    @xmath70    one needs to only choose the correct @xmath71 to find the correlation for rouse or rif and zimm or zif @xcite .",
    "when normal mode correlations of crif or czif are constructed the basic structure of correlation functions remain the same . only @xmath41 and @xmath71",
    "need to be replaced by @xmath72 and @xmath73 respectively .",
    "@xmath74    therefore eq .",
    "( [ eq : cifcorr ] ) is a generalized expression . from now on ,",
    "all the expressions are defined for compacted polymers with internal friction to make the discussion more extensive , from which one can easily get back to rif and zif by taking the limit @xmath75 .",

    "similarly , msd of @xmath86 has the following closed form expression ,    @xmath87      a well known procedure to calculate the looping time is due to wilemski - fixmann ( wf ) @xcite .",
    "although the method was initially posed for end - to - end loop formation , but can be generalized for looping between any two monomers of the polymer chain @xcite , as long as the chain is gaussian .",
    "so , this method is applicable to crif and czif as well . looping time within wf framework is given by following expression ,    @xmath88    where , @xmath89 is the sink - sink correlation function between the @xmath20 and @xmath78 monomer    @xmath90    @xmath91 is the conditional probability that the distance between @xmath20 and @xmath78 monomers of the chain , is @xmath92 at time @xmath93 , and @xmath94 at time @xmath21 .",

    "thus the equilibrium distribution function of crif and czif have narrower widths but remain gaussian @xcite .",
    "similar situation of renormalization of the kuhn length arises during swelling of a polymer chain @xcite , where the kuhn length gets longer .",
    "schuler and his group studied the dynamics of cold shock protein ( csp ) using fret and fcs . from the auto - correlation function of the distance separating any two arbitrary residues they determined intramolecular diffusion coefficients @xcite . in our analysis",
    "all the parameters have been chosen in accordance with these experiments .",
    "thus the polymer has @xmath106 monomers @xmath107 , with kuhn length @xmath108 . in consistance with the viscosity of water , the solvent friction @xmath109 at temperature @xmath110 .",
    "the force constant of the springs connecting monomers to each other is calculated from the relation @xmath111 . without a clear molecular picture of the internal friction",
    ", we have to invoke an ansatz which is @xmath112 @xcite , where @xmath113 is the number non - adjacent monomers contributing to the internal friction and @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the internal friction due to adjacent neighbour interactions as shown for rif in fig .",
    "( [ fig : aa ] ) which arises if @xmath116 and @xmath117 for @xmath118 , @xmath119 . as the solvent quality drops ,",
    "the polymer shrinks bringing more and more number of monomers together .",
    "hence , @xmath113 and @xmath120 increases so as @xmath121 . taking this relation one step further",
    ", we associate @xmath53 with @xmath122 with another ansatz @xmath123 where , a is typically in the order of @xmath124 .",
    "now @xmath53 has two parts @xmath125 and the second part which is proportional to @xmath122 .",
    "this is obvious since the more compact the polymer is , the higher is the internal friction . again in the limit @xmath117 for @xmath118 and @xmath119 @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath125 accounts for the situation when the chain experiences a harmonic confinement but does not have internal friction .",
    "we have considered @xmath125 to be zero in our calculations for the sake of simplicity .",
    "@xmath127 and @xmath128 are identical and referred to as @xmath129 in general . therefore in fig .",
    "( [ fig : bb ] ) the time scale due to the internal friction of each normal mode or @xmath129 is plotted against normal mode number @xmath63 at three different values of @xmath53 namely @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "as expected it saturates at higher modes which shows that higher modes get rarely affected by the confinement and to the higher modes @xmath133 adds as an additive constant as mentioned earlier .",
    "it can also be seen from the graph @xmath129 is completely independent of the mode numbers when @xmath53 is zero since in the absence of @xmath53 , @xmath129 is nothing but @xmath133 . with increasing @xmath53 , @xmath122 also increases which is why @xmath129 becomes larger .",
    "the generalized expression for the reconfiguration time between two monomers @xmath1 and @xmath0 is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : recon ] ) , with @xmath134 and @xmath135 it becomes the end - to - end reconfiguration time .",
    "end - to - end reconfiguration time is computed at different solvent viscosities @xmath136 with three different values of @xmath53 for crif .",
    "effects of hydrodynamics have also been taken care of in czif . to compare with experiments ,",
    "reconfiguration times are plotted against @xmath137 in fig .",
    "( [ fig : cc ] ) and fig .",
    "( [ fig : dd ] ) where , @xmath138 is solvent viscosity and @xmath139 is viscosity of water . in experiments",
    "solvent viscosity is generally varied by adding viscogenic agents such as glycerol to the solution , where as introduction of denaturant such as gdmcl makes a polymer less compact . when plots of @xmath140 vs @xmath137 are extrapolated to zero viscosity",
    ", the intercepts give the value of internal friction which increases with increasing value of @xmath53 and the slopes give the dependence of reconfiguration time on solvent viscosity . while compared with experiments @xcite , the results are consistent with experiments where the intercepts decreases as the denaturant concentration increases ( low @xmath53 ) .",
    "typically the time scale due to internal friction calculated from the intercepts are in the range of @xmath141 ns , which are also in good agreement with the experiments .",
    "similar is the case with zimm chain .",
    "next we plot @xmath2 against @xmath142 , the results obtained here are very fascinating . in case of crif , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ee ] ) , when the value of @xmath53 is small @xmath2 first increases with increasing @xmath142 , until it reaches a hump , from where it starts declining .",
    "this happens due to two opposing factors .",
    "first one is msd of the distance between the @xmath20 and @xmath78 monomer , for which an analytical expression is derived in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : msd ] ) .",
    "msd for every pair of monomers at @xmath143 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ff ] ) , which clearly shows as the distance between two monomers become greater , the msd is also higher which results in faster correlation loss of @xmath94 . if correlation is decaying fast @xmath2 will consequently become smaller .",
    "another factor influencing reconfiguration is the distance between two monomers @xmath0 and @xmath1 along the chain .",
    "this can be seen from the normal mode description , @xmath94 is a sum of normal modes and as @xmath142 decreases , the contribution of higher normal modes will be greater which relaxes much faster .",
    "thus if @xmath142 is small @xmath2 should be small .",
    "because of these two competing effects the reconfiguration time passes through the maxima @xcite .",
    "the trend of @xmath2 vs @xmath142 is quite different at higher degrees of compactness as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ee ] ) .",
    "again the plausible reason behind this might be the competing effect of the two factors , msd and relaxation times of the normal modes describing the part of polymer between the @xmath20 and @xmath78 monomers . when the value of @xmath53 becomes higher and the polymer becomes more compact .",
    "if one looks very carefully into the expression for @xmath144 , it seems with @xmath53 being independent of @xmath122 relaxation should be faster in presence of @xmath53 . but",
    "@xmath122 also becomes large with increasing @xmath53 and as told earlier @xmath69 is greater for higher modes in comparison to the lower ones , which is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : bb ] ) . in a nutshell slowing down of relaxation time is more for higher normal modes compared to the lower ones in presence of higher @xmath53 .",
    "so , at higher @xmath53 , compared to lower value , relaxation is more slower when the distance between @xmath20 and @xmath78 monomers is small , compared to the situation when distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is longer .",
    "msd is reduced as well which can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : ff ] ) which is an obvious outcome of compact state of polymer .",
    "because , in this new model beside the polymer being more compact , the movement of each monomer is very restricted .",
    "but it is clearly observed from fig .",
    "( [ fig : ff ] ) , the decrease of msd is not consistent . with increasing distance between @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "msd is more controlled .",
    "that is why when @xmath142 is small , effect of msd become more prominent and @xmath2 decreases with increasing @xmath142 and for higher @xmath142 the dynamics of the polymer between @xmath0 and @xmath1 is controlled by the the normal modes instead of msd . as a consequence reconfiguration time increases with increasing @xmath142 .    when similar calculations are done for zimm model , as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : gg ] ) even for small @xmath53 reconfiguration time decreases with increasing distance between two monomers similar to the second trend discussed for crif with higher value of @xmath53 .",
    "the relaxation time of the normal modes describing zimm chain are usually faster than that of rouse @xcite .",
    "that is why , at even smaller value of @xmath53 the second trend is be observed .",
    "this trend is very similar to the experimental results found by nettels _",
    "et al _ @xcite where they estimated reconfiguration time as a function of separating distance between two groups from fret .",
    "if the value of @xmath53 is considered even smaller , the first trend observed for crif is recovered again which is not shown here .    looping time is estimated following the wilemski fixman ( wf ) approach , where a sink is placed between the two monomers which will eventually form a loop and has the closed form generalized expression given in eq .",
