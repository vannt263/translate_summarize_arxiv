    "metal - insulator transition ( mit ) is a long standing problem in condensed matter physics and has attracted a lot of attention .",
    "the mott insulating state is established when conduction electrons become localized due to the suspension of the double occupation by electron correlations.@xcite most studies on the mit focus on electron systems with local coulomb interaction between the two spin states of electrons .",
    "the achievement of loading ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices has been providing a novel stage for studying the mott transitions.@xcite indeed , the mott insulating state was realized for @xmath0k fermionic atoms with two hyperfine states and repulsive interaction between them.@xcite this mit is similar to the one of electron systems .",
    "moreover , ultracold fermionic atom mixtures can be extended to have both large hyperfine multiplet and different masses .",
    "a mixture of single - spin state of @xmath0k immersed in two - component fermionic atoms @xmath1li or a mixture of two - component state @xmath2yb and six - component state @xmath3yb were established.@xcite such achievements lead to a possibility of studying the mott transitions in multi - component correlation systems .",
    "theoretically , the mott transitions in three - component hubbard models were studied.@xcite within the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) the mott transition is observed at commensurate fillings when the local coulomb interactions are isotropic.@xcite when the anisotropy of the local coulomb interactions is introduced , the mott transition is also observed at incommensurate half filling.@xcite however , in these studies , all component particles have the same masses .",
    "the mixtures of ultracold atoms are often established with mass imbalance .",
    "the mass imbalance could affect the mit .",
    "indeed , the dmft of the mass - imbalance mixtures shows that the light particles may be more affected by correlations than the heavy ones.@xcite    in this paper we study the mott transitions in a three - component falicov - kimball model ( fkm ) .",
    "this model can be viewed as a version of the three - component hubbard model @xcite with extreme mass imbalance . within the model ,",
    "one - component fermionic particles are extremely heavy and localized .",
    "they are immersed in an optical lattice , where two - component fermionic particles with light mass can hop .",
    "local repulsive interactions between the component states of particles are taken into account .",
    "the three - component fkm can be realized by loading mixtures of two species of fermionic atoms into an optical lattice .",
    "one species is single - spin state heavy atoms and the other is two - component light atoms .",
    "such ultracold atomic mixtures can be realized by mixtures of @xmath0k with @xmath1li , or light @xmath1li or @xmath0k with heavy fermionic isotopes of sr or yb .",
    "when the mixtures are loaded into an optical lattice , the heavy atoms usually have much lower tunneling rate than the light atoms . with sufficient lattice depth",
    ", the hopping rate of the heavy atoms can be ignored in comparison with the one of the light atoms.@xcite similar mixtures of two species of one - component fermionic atoms were also proposed for the realization of the spinless fkm.@xcite the three - component fkm can be considered as a complement of the three - component hubbard model , when a strong mass imbalance is realized .",
    "traditionally , the fkm was introduced to describe the mit in rare - earth and transition metal compounds.@xcite the spinless version of the fkm has a rich phase diagram , and in particular , the homogeneous states establish a correlation - driven mit . at low temperature charge - density - wave states",
    "are established.@xcite the fkm can be extended to have additional terms in order to study different physical phenomena.@xcite multi - component extensions of the fkm were also considered.@xcite however , in the multi - component versions of the fkm , the multiplicity of electron spins is just a formal generation of the spinless case , and the coulomb interactions between the conduction electrons are not taken into account . in this paper",
    ", the three - component fkm keeps all local coulomb interactions between the component states .",
    "in contrast to the spinless case , there is very little knowledge of the physical properties of the multi - component fkm.@xcite    the three - component fkm can also be considered as a combination of the hubbard model of the two - component hopping particles and the spinless fkm of the one - component localized particles . at half filling the hubbard model exhibits the mit which is driven by the coulomb interaction.@xcite the insulating state is naturally the mott insulator,@xcite where the double occupation is suspended by the coulomb interaction .",
    "the mit is discontinuous.@xcite at half filling the spinless fkm also displays a mit , although this mit is continuous.@xcite when the coulomb interaction is large enough , it also prevents the hopping and localized particles to occupy at the same site . as a result",
    ", the insulating state is established .",
    "one may expect that the three - component fkm could exhibit a rich phase diagram of the mit .",
    "indeed , in the present paper we find both continuous and discontinuous mit .",
    "the mit can occur not only at half filling , but also at other fillings between one third and two thirds .",
    "in the present paper we study the three - component fkm by using the dmft with exact diagonalization ( ed ) .",
    "the dmft has been widely and successfully used to study the strongly correlated electron systems.@xcite it has been also extensively applied to study the fkm.@xcite the previous studies of mit in the three - component hubbard model were also based on the dmft.@xcite the advantage of the dmft is that it is exact in infinite dimensions and fully captures local time fluctuations .",
    "however , the dmft loses nonlocal correlations of finite dimension systems . within the dmft we find that like the three - component hubbard model,@xcite the three - component fkm exhibits the mott transition at both commensurate and incommensurate fillings .",
    "however , in contrast to the three - component hubbard model , the mit can occur at any filling between one third and two thirds .",
    "we also find an inverse mit , i.e. the transition from insulator to metal when particle correlations increase .",
    "the inverse mit can occur only in the region of large repulsive interactions between localized and hopping particles . at half filling ,",
    "a reentrant effect of the mott insulator is observed . with increasing coulomb interactions",
    ", the system first stays in the insulator region , then it becomes metallic , and finally goes back to the insulating phase .",
    "the first transition is continuous , while the second one is discontinuous . at the second mit",
    ", we observe a finite region where both metallic and insulating phases coexist , like the mit in the single - band hubbard model.@xcite however , in contrast to the single - band hubbard model , the mit in the three - component fkm is due to a superposition of two kondo resonances that are shifted from the fermi level . at one third and two thirds fillings ,",
    "the mott transition is established only for strong repulsive interactions and a phase separation occurs together with the phase transition .",

    "the pseudogap is developed from the gap of the insulating phase . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , this behavior is shown by the dos with @xmath111 .",
    "the phase with pseudogap corresponds to the case of finite value of the imaginary part of the self energy at zero energy . with further increasing @xmath11 ,",
    "the dos exhibits a group of narrow peaks around @xmath118 . in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] it is shown by the dos with @xmath114 . in the single - band hubbard model , the group of narrow peaks at @xmath118 represents the kondo resonance.@xcite however , due to the finite size effect and the discreteness of the ed , the kondo resonance does not appear at the full scale .",
    "nevertheless , the appearance of the group of narrow peaks at @xmath118 can be interpreted as a signal of the kondo resonance .",
    "however , in contrast to the single - band hubbard model , the local green function here is a superposition of two local subband green functions @xmath122 as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ gimp ] ) . each local subband green function",
    "is described by an anderson impurity with the coulomb interaction @xmath11 embedded in a conduction bath .",
    "the energy level of the anderson impurity is @xmath123 .",
    "the anderson impurity is symmetric when its energy level is placed at @xmath124.@xcite since @xmath125 , the anderson impurity is asymmetric .",
    "therefore , the kondo resonance that appears in the local subband dos , must be shifted from the fermi level.@xcite only for the symmetric anderson impurity the kondo resonance peaks at the fermi level .",
    "consequently , the group of narrow peaks at @xmath118 represents the superposition of the two shifted kondo peaks .",
    "it can be considered as an asymmetric kondo splitting .",
    "experimental observations of the asymmetric kondo splitting in the spectra of the light particles are challenging . with tunable value of @xmath14 , experiments could observe the asymmetric kondo splitting in the spectra of light particles and the splitting width increases with increasing @xmath14 . at @xmath126",
    "the group of narrow peaks disappears , and the system becomes insulating .",
    "however , as in the single band hubbard model , the insulating solution exists until @xmath127 . in the region @xmath74 both metallic and insulating solutions coexist .",
    "thus , the second mit is of first order .",
    "this mit solely deals with the light particles , because it exists even when @xmath14 is small .",
    "the transition is the species selective mit . in the insulating phase each lattice site",
    "is occupied by one light particle , and the coulomb interaction prevents the double occupation of the light particles .",
    "experiments could detect the existence of the coexistent region by measuring the double occupation of the light particles . across the region , the double occupation must exhibit a jump in its value . the mit mechanisms of the two mit are different . in the first inverse mit",
    ", the pseudogap of the metallic phase is developed from the gap of the insulating phase , whereas in the second species selective mit , the phase transition occurs due to the collapse of the asymmetric kondo splitting .    .",
    "in the grey area , both metallic and insulating phase coexist .",

    "we summarize the phase transitions in the phase diagram plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] . in the region",
    "@xmath77 , there are two mits .",
    "one is inverse mit and the other is species selective mit . at the first transition ( @xmath120 ) , particle correlations drive the system from insulating to metallic phase , while at the second one , particle correlations drive the system from metallic to insulating phase . a finite region of coexistence of the metallic and insulating phase exists between the species selective mit .",
    "the critical value @xmath120 of the inverse mit increases with @xmath14 .",
    "it vanishes at @xmath128 .",
    "hence , in the region @xmath78 the reentrant effect of the insulating phase is absent .",
    "the phase diagram is consistent with the analysis of the phase transitions observed from dependence of @xmath94 on the chemical potential which have been presented in the previous subsection .      .",

    "( @xmath71 , @xmath93).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in this subsection we study the mit at third filling @xmath129 .",
    "the mit is quite different in comparison with the half filling case .",
    "it works with both the light and heavy particles . in numerical calculations the chemical potential",
    "is adjusted in order to maintain @xmath130 .",
    "the two thirds filling case @xmath131 is the particle - hole symmetry of this one third filling case .",
    "we plot the phase diagram for the third filling case in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] .",
    "the value @xmath120 at the mit point quickly increases as @xmath14 approaches to the value @xmath34 , while it slowly decreases as @xmath14 increases .",
    "the insulating phase is established only for sufficient large coulomb interactions ( both @xmath11 and @xmath14 ) . in the insulating phase",
    "each lattice site is occupied by one particle of the light or heavy particle components , and the coulomb interactions prevent any double occupation .",
    "the mit can also be analyzed through the self energy and the dos of the light particles , as in the case of half filling .",
    "the behaviors of the self energy in the metallic and insulating phases exhibit similar features as in the half filling case . however , the features of the dos are different . in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we plot the dos for different values of @xmath11 and fixed @xmath14 .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ gimp ] ) that the local green function is a superposition of two subband green functions with nonequal weights .",
    "the kondo peak , which appears in the local subband dos , is away from the fermi energy and is reduced.@xcite therefore , the peak that appears at the fermi level in the metallic phase is merely the superposition of two local subband dos , and maybe it is irrelevant to the kondo resonance .",
    "thus , the mit can occur at the third filling in contrast to the single - band hubbard model , where no mit is observed at third filling .",
    "in contrast to the half filling case , we do not observe any region of coexistence of metallic and insulating phase .",

    "[ fig13 ] , when @xmath132 , the graphics of @xmath94 does not show any plateau at @xmath130 , which indicates the metallic phase .",
    "however , for @xmath11 close to @xmath120 in the insulator side , the graphics of @xmath94 show not only the plateau , which indicates the insulating state , but also a gap at fillings close to @xmath130 . within the gap ,",
    "the filling @xmath94 is uncertainty .",
    "this feature indicates a phase separation at those fillings .",
    "the mit at third filling is commensurate .",
    "it does not distinguish the light particles from the heavy ones .",
    "any double occupation must be vanished at the transition point .",
    "the mit is also observed at third filling in the three - component hubbard model.@xcite one can notice that the commensurate mit always occurs at the commensurate fillings independently whether the mass imbalance or the interaction anisotropy exist or not .",
    "working at the commensurate fillings , experiments could detect this mit .     as a function of the chemical potential @xmath19 for various values of @xmath11 close to the transition value @xmath133 and fixed @xmath90 .",

    "we find the conditions for the particle fillings at which the mit can occur .",
    "in particular , the mit can occur at total filling @xmath134 .",
    "when the total filling @xmath80 , the mit is species selective , and it can occur only at half filling of the light particles ( @xmath81 ) . at the total filling of one third or two thirds , the mit can occur only at sufficient strong coulomb interactions .",

    "we have also studied in details the mit at half and third fillings . at half filling the reentrant effect of insulating phase is observed .",
    "as the coulomb interactions increase , the system first stays in the insulating phase , then it becomes metallic , and finally it goes back to the insulating phase .",
    "the first mit is continuous , while the second one is discontinuous . as in the single - band hubbard model",
    ", we also observe a finite region at the second mit , where both metallic and insulating phase coexist .",

    "the mit can occur only for sufficient strong coulomb interactions .",
