    "particle acceleration in a velocity shear layer was proposed in the early eighties by berezhko with collaborators and then gradually developed ( cf . a review by berezhko 1990 ) .",
    "action of such a mechanism at relativistic shear layers occurring at side boundaries of relativistic jets was discussed by ostrowski ( 1990 , 1998 , 2000 ) .",
    "the mechanism was considered to provide ultra high energy cosmic rays and to be an important factor influencing the dynamics of relativistic jets in extragalactic radio sources thereby forming _ cosmic rays cocoons_. ostrowski & sikora ( 2001 ) proposed that such acceleration mechanism can provide a cosmic ray proton population being a substantial pressure factor in fr ii radio source lobes .",
    "the existence of the boundary layer with a velocity shear was first suggested by the observations of radio and optical jets in fr i sources .",
    "owen et al . ( 1989 ) concluded that the jet morphology in m87 is dominated by the boundary layer more than by the shock structure .",
    "constancy of radio - to - optical spectral index along the jet and similarity of radio and optical maps with emissivity peaking near the jet s surface strongly suggested acceleration of radiating electrons _ in situ _ at the boundary layer .",
    "later radio and optical polarimetry of m87 ( perlman et al . 1999 ) confirmed the complex structure of its jet containing a shear layer with a highly ordered magnetic field parallel to the jets axis .",
    "a map of the radio spectral index of another well known bl lac , mkn 501 , revealed a boundary region of its jet with an unexpectedly flat spectrum ( edwards et al . 2000 ) , suggesting action of some reacceleration mechanism at the jet surface .",
    "some fr ii radio sources also reveal _ spine - shear layer _ jet morphology . for instance",
    "radio observations of 3c353 ( swain et al . 1998 ) was interpreted in terms of a doppler - hidden relativistic spine surrounded by the slower moving boundary region .",
    "vlbi observations of another fr ii object 1055 + 018 ( attridge et al .",
    "1999 ) revealed a fragmentary but distinct boundary layer with the mean longitudinal magnetic field present where interactions with surrounding matter were strongest ( i.e. , where the jet bended ) . optical and radio observations of the quasar 3c 273 ( jester et al . 2001 ) showed smooth changes of the radio - to - optical spectral index along the jet .",
    "this strongly suggested reacceleration of the radiating electrons taking place not in the specific shock - like regions , but within the _ whole _ jet .",
    "one should note that our knowledge of physical conditions at the relativistic jet boundary is still insufficient .",
    "cosmic ray viscosity and radiation viscosity in a boundary layer with a velocity shear influencing hydrodynamics of the jet and particle distribution along its surface was studied by earl et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , jokipii et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and arav & begelman ( 1992 ) , respectively . on the other hand",
    ", 3d simulations revealed the presence of a jet shear layer with a high specific internal energy and highly turbulent , subsonic and thin cocoon surrounding the relativistic flow ( aloy et al .",
    "simulations of radio emission from such jets ( aloy et al . 2000 ) show radial structures in both intensity and polarization .",
    "let us assume that a thickness of the transition layer between the jet and the surrounding medium , @xmath1 , is comparable to the jet radius @xmath2 ( cf .",
    "owen et al .",
    "1989 , swain et al .",
    "1998 ) , and that the magnetic field @xmath3 frozen into tenuous plasma at and outside the boundary is on average parallel to the flow velocity @xmath4 .",
    "acceleration of energetic particles injected into the boundary layer results from its scattering on irregularities of the magnetic field in a turbulent medium with a perpendicular to @xmath4 mean velocity gradient . in the considered case of the mean magnetic field aligned along the jet in a highly turbulent boundary layer plasma , a particle gyroradius @xmath5 can be considered instead of a particle mean free path @xmath6 , and cross - field radial diffusion provides a particle escape mechanism from the acceleration region . for particles with energies satisfying @xmath7 , the acceleration within a finite thickness turbulent _ shear _ layer results from , both , the second order fermi process in the turbulent medium and the _ cosmic ray viscosity_. we consider the jet velocity to be comparable to the light velocity even on kiloparsec scales , @xmath8 , and a characteristic velocity of magnetic turbulence , @xmath9 , to be comparable to the alfvn velocity for a subsonic turbulence and at least a few orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath10 .",
    "the fermi process dominates over the viscous acceleration when the particle energy is small enough to satisfy @xmath11 . because of rapid energy radiation losses at high energies ,",
    "the electrons are always expected to satisfy the required condition .",
    "then , the acceleration time scale in a highly turbulent shear layer can be estimated ( ostrowski 2000 ) as @xmath12 with anticipated parameters of the boundary layer  @xmath13  and @xmath14  the characteristic acceleration time scale ( 1 ) is @xmath15}$ ] , where @xmath16 is the electron lorenz factor .",
    "one should note , that equation ( 1 ) illustrates the most optimistic scenario for the acceleration process , with presence of non - linear mhd turbulence at the scale of @xmath5 .",
    "the time scale for particle escape from the acceleration region due to cross - field diffusion can be estimated as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the cross - field diffusion coefficient , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is a scaling numerical factor .",
    "the particle escape becomes important when the electron energy satisfies condition @xmath21 , i.e. when @xmath22 .",
    "for the considered boundary layer parameters and a strong turbulence condition @xmath23 , equation ( 2 ) reads as @xmath24}$ ] , and hence radiative ( synchrotron ) cooling with a time scale @xmath25}$ ] becomes important for the much lower electrons energies .",
    "therefore , by comparing the acceleration time scale ( 1 ) with the time scale for radiative losses , one obtains the maximum electron energy , @xmath26 .",
    "rapid radiative cooling of electrons with such high maximum energy is compensated by the continuous acceleration taking place within the whole boundary layer along the jet . for lower turbulence amplitude",
    "the acceleration process can proceed slower to yield a lower value for @xmath27 .    in the present model , after switching on the injection of seed electrons with a small initial lorentz factor @xmath28 , a time dependent spectral evolution of particles accelerated in the turbulent layer begins as a power - law distribution with a growing energy cut - off .",
    "then it evolves into a characteristic shape consisting of two different components : a stationary flat power - law part at low energies , @xmath29 , finished with a nearly monoenergetic growing peak , or bump , at @xmath30 , due to an accelerated particles pile - up caused by losses ( cf .",
    "ostrowski 2000 ) .",
    "such electron spectrum can be approximately given by a formula using the haeviside function , @xmath31 , and the dirac delta function , @xmath32 . at energies above the injection energy , @xmath28 , the electron distribution @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are normalization parameters ( and @xmath35 is a growing function of time )",
    ", @xmath36 is the highest energy the electrons can reach since the injection with radiation losses neglected , and @xmath37 .",
    "we consider two radiation processes taking place at the relativistic jet boundary : the synchrotron ( syn ) emission of ultrarelativistic electrons with the energy spectrum ( 3 ) , and their inverse compton ( ic ) cooling .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption can be neglected with the assumed optical depth for this process to be much less than unity for @xmath38 .",
    "additionally , the present preliminary ic scattering calculations are limited to the thomson regime assuming a step scattering cross section . a high energy spectral cut - off resulting from absorption of gamma rays due to photon - photon pair creation on a cosmic infrared background",
    "is expected to occur for distant sources ( e.g. renault et al .",
    "therefore , the obtained below photon spectra above tev energies can not be directly compared to observations . in the case of ic emission of a tens - of - kpc scale jets , we study the synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) radiation and compton scattering of external cmb photons ( ec ) . with the assumed parameters ,",
    "the magnetic field energy density at the jet boundary is @xmath39 .",
    "the energy density of the cmb field in a source frame moving with a bulk lorentz factor @xmath40 at a redshift @xmath41 is @xmath42 , where an asterisk denotes quantities in our local rest frame , and @xmath43 . in the jet rest frame @xmath44",
    "can be comparable to @xmath45 , and both above processes can be significant even for small @xmath40 and @xmath41 .    for the optically thin emission , radiation intensities of the power - law ( ` 1 ' ) and the high energy bump ( ` 2 ' ) electron components ( c.f .",
    "are approximatly @xmath46 where , for the assumed large scale jet parameters and neglecting the cosmological redshift correction , the maximum synchrotron , self - compton and external compton frequencies are @xmath47 , @xmath48 \\ , \\gamma_{max}^2(t)$ ] and @xmath49 , respectively . in deriving equations ( 4 ) - ( 6 ) we used the standard theory of the synchrotron and the inverse - compton radiation with simple approximations allowing evaluation of analytic expressions ( e.g. crusius & schlickeiser 1986 and dermer 1995 , respectively ; for details see forthcoming paper stawarz & ostrowski 2001 ) .",
    "the intensities ( 4 ) - ( 6 ) allow to describe the photon spectrum variations resulting from the particle distribution evolution given in equation ( 3 ) . in the model , from the beginning of injection the accelerated electrons form the power - law spectrum with the energy cut - off growing with time .",
    "then @xmath50 and the resulting emission is a power - law @xmath51 , with a growing cut - offs @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "when the maximum electron energy approaches @xmath27 , the high energy particle density peak forms and starts to grow .",
    "then , an additional radiation components @xmath55 ( for the synchrotron radiation ) , @xmath51 and @xmath55 ( for the ssc emission ) , and @xmath56 ( for the ec emission ) appear and eventually dominate the spectrum at highest x - ray and @xmath16-ray frequencies . the spectral index @xmath57 results from the asymptotic expansion of the synchrotron emissivity function of the ` peak ' electrons with the energy @xmath27 ( c.f .",
    "crusius & schlickeiser 1986 ) , and the index @xmath58 corresponds to the rayleigh - like approximation of the anizotropic ( in the relativistic fluid rest frame ) cmb radiation comptonized by the monoenergetic electrons .",
    "let us also briefly discuss the main implications of kinematic effects in the radiative jet output . for illustration , let us consider a long cylindrical jet of the radius @xmath59 , moving with a constant flow lorentz factor @xmath60 , surrounded by a boundary layer with a constant thickness @xmath61 , ( cf .",
    "aloy et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the radial flow profile @xmath62 . in the local source rest frame ,",
    "the synchrotron , ssc and ec intensities are given by expressions ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) , respectively , but the observed intensities are @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a spectral index given in the respective expression ( 4 ) - ( 6 ) , and @xmath66 is a doppler factor for a sub - layer at a distance @xmath67 from the jet axis and the jet inclination to the line of sight equal @xmath68 . because of a velocity shear , the boundary layer emission beaming pattern is different compared to the uniform beaming pattern of a spine radiation . for a given viewing angle @xmath68 , boundary layer emission comes mostly from the region with @xmath69 , where the doppler factor is maximized . as a result",
    ", the observed jet - counterjet brightness asymmetry is decreased in comparison to the uniform jet with @xmath70 , allowing the spine to be more relativistic in the large scale jets than traditional estimates suggest ( c.f .",
    "komissarov 1990 ) .    the observed boundary layer emission , @xmath71 , are plotted on fig .  1 for four different viewing angles",
    ". lines indicated by @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 correspond to different forms of the particle spectrum obtained in the considered acceleration model in successive times from the beginning of the acceleration process .",
    "for instance the line @xmath72 illustrates resultant sum of synchrotron , self - compton and external compton emission of the power - law electron component ( index ` 1 ' in eq .  4 - 6 ) with an energy cut - off @xmath75 , while the line @xmath74 includes also the additional contribution from the high energy electron bump at @xmath76 ( index ` 2 ' in eq .",
    "the presented spectra are integrated over the line of sight with the assumed linear dependence @xmath77 within the shear layer .",
    "in the present paper , we study radiation of ultrarelativistic electrons accelerated at the boundary shear layer of the large scale relativistic jet .",
    "the considered acceleration process generate a characteristic particle distribution consisting of two components : the power - law section extended up to a more or less narrow pile - up bump , modeled here as the monoenergetic peak .",
    "a possible characteristic of such a cosmic ray population is its time variability , constrained by the not considered here , non - linear particle backreaction at the acceleration process .",
    "the acceleration within the jet boundary layer with inefficient particle escape due to radial diffusion could increas the energetic particle energy density @xmath78 to extremely high values .",
    "however , when @xmath78 becomes comparable to the ambient medium energy density , the accelerated particles can influence physical conditions within the boundary region .",
    "the involved electron pressure tends to expand the acceleration region rarefying the medium and , possibly , decreasing the efficiency of the acceleration process ( c.f .",
    "arav & begelman 1992 , ostrowski 2000 ) .",
    "changes of the boundary layer density can result in changing several characteristic of the acceleration process , in particular shifting of the local value of @xmath27 and changing of the flow profile at the boundary .",
    "such particle pressure backreaction , leading to local temporal variations of the high energy electron component , will generate fluctuations of the high energy radiation over the stationary power - law component emission at low photon energies .",
    "for the assumed physical conditions with @xmath76 , the process involves variations at x - ray and @xmath16-ray bands with energies of @xmath79 kev and @xmath79 tev , respectively . in our study of the tens - of - kpc scale jets , the involved time scales are @xmath80 , and , thus , can result in spatial kpc - scale brightness variations along the jet boundary .",
    "much shorter scales are possibly involved in ( sub ) mili - arc - second jets , with much smaller ( a factor of @xmath81 ) spatial scales , much larger ( a factor of @xmath82 ) magnetic fields , and stronger external radiation fields ( study in progress now ) .    as the described above radiative spectral components",
    "appear in a natural way in the discussed process , the stationary or time averaged spectra possibly formed due to the mentioned non - linear effects are also expected to posses such components .",
    "then , one should observe x - ray and @xmath16-ray excesses in electromagnetic spectrum of the jet , as illustrated on fig .  1 . with the jet parameters considered above",
    ", such an x - ray flux above the extrapolated radio - to - optical continuum can explain the kev emission detected in several jets by chandra .",
    "one should note , that our simple model , far from being complete , is supposed to describe main radiative properties of the boundary region under simple assumptions , and to provide restrictions on physical conditions within such layer .",
