    "supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) , born in the early , more dynamic universe , intermittently underwent eruptions at the expense of the gravitational energies of the infalling gas or stars , but today they are mostly `` dead '' , lurking in the nuclei of quiescent galaxies @xcite . during the eruption ,",
    "a smbh becomes detectable in the electromagnetic window , and the phenomenon is called active galactic nucleus ( agn ) .",
    "the possibility that an agn occurred a long time ago in our galaxy brought up some early scientific discussions of its potential impact on terrestrial lives @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , these prospects have not been actively pursued , partly because agns were thought to be uncommon it was considered that agns are triggered by galaxy mergers , but there is evidence suggesting that our galaxy has not experienced a substantial one during the past @xmath4 billion years @xcite .",
    "there was also a practical difficulty .",
    "although it had been realized that x - ray photons could penetrate the dusty galactic plane and impact earth @xcite , the x - ray radiation of an agn had not been well characterized at that time , leaving large uncertainties in estimating the actual irradiance on earth .",
    "recent studies , instead , suggest that milky - way - like galaxies frequently nurture agns @xcite , about once every @xmath5 years per galaxy with each agn lasting about @xmath3 years .",
    "these statistics indicate that in the local universe the smbhs less massive than @xmath6 are activated not by galaxy mergers , but by stochastic processes such as gravitational instability .",
    "the stochastic mode explains the aforementioned outburst of sagittarius a * ( hereafter ) which occurred merely @xmath7 million years ago @xcite .",
    "the conjecture , that in this mode a low - mass black hole accretes matter at a high rate and grows rapidly @xcite , also broadly agrees with the inferred luminosity of the outburst @xcite , about @xmath8 of the eddington limit @xmath9 .",
    "agns radiating at near - eddington rates are known to emit about @xmath10 of their bolometric luminosity in hard x - ray ( @xmath1 kev ) @xcite .",
    "this correlation is anticipated if there is a universal coronal structure covering the surface of accretion disk that powers an agn @xcite .",
    "if once was a normal agn so that the x - ray luminosity reached @xmath11 , then given its distance and the fact that hard x - ray photons suffer little attenuation in the galactic plane , one will derive an irradiance of @xmath12 that will be incident on earth .",
    "this is already comparable to the x - ray irradiance from the quiescent sun @xcite .",
    "a sudden enhancement of the x - ray irradiation on earth will immediately increase the ionization of the upper atmosphere , leading to a chain of secondary reactions , including ozone depletion and higher uv flux at the sea level @xcite .",
    "the magnitudes of these changes are determined by the intensity and duration of the x - ray irradiation , as well as the spectral shape of the ionizing radiation .",
    "these factors , in the light of possible ancient outbursts from , will be quantified in this paper .",
    "to assess the relative importance of the x - ray irradiation from , in figure  [ fig1 ] we compare the irradiances on earth from the sun @xcite and from the active .",
    "for the latter , the intrinsic spectral energy distribution ( sed , i.e. the luminosity per logarithmic energy bin ) is computed using the templates compiled from a sample of unobscured agns @xcite . according to these templates ,",
    "given the ratio @xmath13 between the bolometric luminosity @xmath14 and the eddington luminosity @xmath15 , the luminosity @xmath16 of the photons in the band @xmath17 scales as    @xmath18    the photon index @xmath19 , the index of a power law which characterizes the number of photons in each energy bin , is given by    @xmath20    sed will have a power - law index of @xmath21 . when converting the sed to the spectral irradiance on earth ( @xmath22 )",
    ", the extinction law of the galactic plane ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) is applied @xcite .    from figure  [ fig1 ] , we find that at @xmath1 kev the irradiance from the agn , irrespective of the assumption of @xmath25 , exceeds that of the sun during the solar minimum . moreover , while the sun has a soft sed above @xmath26 kev ( @xmath27 ) , the sed of the agn is much harder , with a strong component in the high energy band , which normally extends to an energy band as high as @xmath28 kev @xcite , the band of soft @xmath29-ray .",
    "this component makes the agn brighter than the sun in the hard - x - ray / soft-@xmath29-ray sky , even when the sun is undergoing an x - class solar flare . for the agn",
    ", we also see an increase of the irradiance at @xmath30 kev with decreasing @xmath25 .",
    "this anti - correlation , which is a common feature for disk corona @xcite , sustains the brightness of the agn in the x - ray sky even when @xmath31 has dropped by a factor of @xmath32 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of can be temporarily enhanced also by tidal disruption of a nearby star @xcite .",
    "the event rate is about once every @xmath33 years during the quiescent phase of @xcite , and during the agn phase the rate can be even higher , because of the perturbation of the nearby stars by the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "except for those rare cases in which jets are produced and accidentally directed towards observers , a standard tidal flare has a soft , thermal sed with an effective temperature of @xmath34 kev , therefore producing a negligible amount of hard x - ray .",
    "however , a small fraction of the tidal flares @xcite do exhibit strong power - law components with @xmath35 in the energy band @xmath1 kev , which can not be attributed to jets @xcite , and instead , may be produced by shock - heated materials that are incompletely thermalized @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] compares the spectral irradiance of an agn with that of a tidal flare , assuming a solar - type star being disrupted by . in our model the intrinsic sed of the tidal flare has two components , ( 1 ) a black - body emitter whose temperature and surface area are given by the standard model @xcite , and ( 2 ) a power - law component with @xmath36 whose luminosity is @xmath37 of the black - body emission @xcite .",
    "we do not know the sed in the first @xmath38 days following the initial outburst , because during this period @xmath39 according to our model , and an optical - thick wind may be present and obscuring the flare @xcite . bearing in mind that assuming a different @xmath19 or a different type of star also leads to some uncertainties in the sed , we conclude that a tidal flare during the first few weeks is as bright as an agn .",
    "although there is no calculation so far elaborating on the response of the earth atmosphere to the above x - ray outbursts , earlier works on cataclysmic events with similar x - ray characteristics have provided some hints .",
    "for example , in the past 30 years several distant ( soft ) gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) had induced similar level of irradiation on earth , about @xmath40 at @xmath41 kev , during which disturbances of the ionosphere had been detected @xcite .",
    "the disturbance of the ionosphere by may be more serious , because tidal flares and agns last for a much longer time , ranging from a few weeks to as long as @xmath3 years .    besides irradiance , another quantity which is often used to evaluate the lethality of ionizing radiation is the so - called fluence , i.e. the total amount of radiation injected into one unit area on earth .",
    "according to our models , the fluence ranges from @xmath42 during a one - week tidal flare to about @xmath43 during one agn episode . for comparison , in a hypothetical scenario of a nearby supernova @xcite",
    ", a dose of hard x - ray equivalent to @xmath44 will be injected into the earth s atmosphere , and the consequence is a depletion of the ozone by as much as @xmath45 .",
    "fortunately , the irradiation from , e.g. during an agn , will be stretched over a period much longer than that of a supernova , leaving more time for the biosphere on earth to adjust .",
    "it is important to note that the irradiance from is constant across the solar system while that from the sun drops quickly with increasing distance .",
    "the consequence , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , is that from about @xmath4 au to the edge of the solar system , the irradiation from during its outburst predominates in the entire x - ray band of @xmath46 kev .",
    "most of the gas giants in the solar system , including their moons , lie in this region , but the corresponding reaction of their atmosphere has not been explored .",
    "last but not least , x - ray irradiation can also drive the chemical reactions in dense molecular clouds @xcite and enhance the abundance of organic molecules in protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "the implication is that the ancient outbursts from may have played an important role in shaping the habitable environment in the solar system , as well as in other places throughout the milky way .",
