    "last time , great interest is paid to properties of quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) antiferromagnets in connection with the investigations of layered perovskites @xcite and copper - oxide systems , including high-@xmath7 superconductors . in particular , la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 gives one of the best known example of a quasi-2d system with small magnetic anisotropy .",
    "unlike 2d systems , quasi-2d ones have finite values of magnetic ordering temperature . at small interlayer couplings",
    "@xmath8 the value of magnetic transition temperature is small in comparison with the intraplane exchange parameter @xmath9 .",
    "there are a number of approximations which enable to describe the thermodynamics of such systems .",
    "the standard spin - wave theory ( swt ) takes into account only the spin - wave excitations which exist for quasi-2d systems in a wide temperature range up to about @xmath9 ( refs.@xcite ) .",
    "swt does not take into account the dynamic and kinematic interaction between spin waves , which are important at temperatures near magnetic phase transition point . by this reason",
    ", swt gives too high values of magnetic transition temperature .",
    "recently , the self - consistent spin - wave theory @xcite ( sswt ) has been proposed which takes into account partially the interaction between spin waves . however , the value of the neel temperature in sswt is still too high in comparison with experiment , and the critical behavior is described quite incorrectly .    to describe the magnetic phase transition we have to take into consideration fluctuation ( non - spin - wave ) corrections to thermodynamic quantities .",
    "it is difficult to take into account such corrections in the standard technique of the green s functions because of essentialy nonlinear character of equations of motion .",
    "there exists the interpolation approximation by tyablikov @xcite which is based on the random - phase decoupling of equations of motion for the transverse spin green s function@xmath10 this approach yields often results which are roughly satisfactory from the experimental point of view . at the same time , it is difficult to justify and improve such approximations .    to develop perturbation theory which describes correctly the critical behavior , we have to introduce a formal large parameter in the heisenberg model .",
    "thus the heisenberg model can be treated as a model with a large degeneracy within the @xmath2-expansion .",
    "this expansion may be introduced in two different ways . the first way @xcite treats the heisenberg model as a particular case ( @xmath11 ) of the @xmath12 model ( i.e. of the model with @xmath13 states per spin degree of freedom at each site ) .",
    "since the @xmath14 limit corresponds to sswt ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , at finite @xmath13 thermodynamics is described in terms of the spin - wave picture of excitation spectrum . the second way @xcite is to consider the heisenberg model as a particular case ( @xmath15 ) of the @xmath1 model ( i.e. of the model with @xmath0-component spins ) .",
    "the limit @xmath16 gives the quantum spherical model and the large-@xmath0 case corresponds to the fluctuation ( non - spin - wave ) picture .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath2 ( or @xmath17 ) expansions over , say , the quasiclassical @xmath18 expansion is their applicability near the phase transition temperature .    since @xmath19 and @xmath11 are in fact not large , the convergence of such expansions must be investigated separately . for low - dimensional magnets with @xmath20 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath21 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) the results in the @xmath12 model coincide in the zeroth order in @xmath17 with those of the one - loop rg analysis , and in the first order in @xmath17 with the results of the two - loop rg analysis . in these cases",
    "the @xmath17-corrections to thermodynamic quantities are small .",
    "however , quasi-2d systems belong to @xmath22 symmetry group so that corresponding @xmath17-corrections are not small ( see discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the series in @xmath17 is poorly convergent . unlike the @xmath17-expansion in the @xmath12 model , the first - order @xmath2-corrections in the @xmath1 model , which were considered in the quantum 2d case @xcite and in the classical case at an arbitrary dimensionality @xmath23 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , lead to results which are close to those obtained by other methods .",
    "the applicability of the @xmath2-expansion at arbitrary dimensionality @xmath24 is important for the investigation of quasi-2d systems since they demonstrate the dimensional crossover from 2d to 3d behavior ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the renormalization group @xmath25-expansion is not appliciable for @xmath20 and @xmath26 simultaneously : for @xmath27 it can not describe satisfactorily the case @xmath26 and vice versa , for @xmath28 the behavior at @xmath29 is poor .",
    "thus , instead of direct calculation of corrections to sswt , we start in this paper from the quantum spherical model , @xmath30 and then find the @xmath2-corrections .",
    "although the results in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 models are different , it will be shown that already in the first order in @xmath32 at low enough temperatures the results in the @xmath1 model are identical to those in @xmath31 ( i.e. in sswt ) . at higher temperatures",
    "the results of sswt are modified due to fluctuation corrections .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sect.2",
    "we review various approximations in the theory of quasi-2d systems , which are based on the spin - wave picture of excitation spectrum , and analyze the corresponding expressions for the neel temperature . in sect.3",
    "we formulate the @xmath1 model for the quasi-2d case and the technique of the @xmath2-expansion , which is a generalization of that by chubukov et al @xcite for the 2d case . in sect.4",
    "we calculate the magnetization , neel temerature and spin correlation function to first order in @xmath33 in sect.5 we discuss our results and compare them with experimental data on la@xmath5cuo@xmath6 .",
    "we start from the heisenberg hamiltonian of a quasi-2d antiferromagnet @xmath34 with the exchange interactions @xmath35 for @xmath36 in a plane and @xmath37 for @xmath36 perpendicular to the planes .    at small values of interlayer coupling @xmath8",
    "it is possible to derive analytical results for the neel temperature .",
    "first we consider the standard spin - wave theory .",
    "the spectrum of spin waves has the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fourier transforms of the exchange parameter @xmath40 the sublattice magnetization is determined by @xmath41 for small values of @xmath42 swt yields different analytical expressions for the neel temperatue in the quantum regime ( @xmath43 ) and classical regime ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "we have @xmath45 here @xmath46 is a cutoff parameter determined by the boundary of the brillouin zone .",
    "note that for the quantum case the main contribution to integrals over the wavevector comes from the region with @xmath47 , while in the classical case the value of @xmath48 is determined by the whole brillouin zone .",
    "the spin - wave spectrum in sswt and the tyablikov approach is renormalized in different ways .",
    "sswt @xcite takes into account the interaction between spin waves in the simplest self - consistent born approximation .",
    "there exist several generalizations of sswt on quasi-2d systems @xcite .",
    "we will follow to approach of refs.@xcite which gives more satisfactory results at small @xmath42 .",
    "the spin - wave spectrum in sswt has the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the renormalized exchange parameters which are determined from the self - consistent equations @xmath52 the sublattice magnetization is given by @xmath53 at small values of @xmath42 we have @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the sublattice magnetization in the ground state .",
    "the quantity @xmath50 varies slowly with temperature in the whole region @xmath56 and may be replaced by its zero - temperature value @xmath57 according to refs.@xcite , we have @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62for @xmath63 . the second case in ( [ magnsswt ] )",
    "may be realized only in the classical limit @xmath64 one can see from ( [ magnsswt ] ) that the value of the critical exponent for the magnetization is @xmath65 the same critical behavior takes place at an arbitrary @xmath66 this result is correct only at @xmath21 to leading order in @xmath25 ( @xmath67 see , e.g. , refs.@xcite ) , and for higher dimensionalities @xmath68 .    as follows from ( [ magnsswt ] ) , the neel temperature is determined by the equation of ref .",
    "@xcite ( note that some coefficients in this paper are incorrect ) @xmath69 here @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the renormalized exchange parameters at @xmath72 , the value of @xmath73 determined from ( [ g ] ) is @xmath74 in both the quantum and classical regimes .",
    "note that the renormalization of the interlayer coupling in ( [ tnsswt ] ) plays a crucial role in lowering the neel temperature in comparison with its swt value ( [ tnsw ] ) since @xmath75 .",
    "in the tyablikov theory @xcite ( tt ) the excitation spectrum has the form @xmath76 as well as in a ferromagnet , the proportionality of the spectrum to @xmath77 is not quite correct at low temperatures : in the antiferromagnet the spin - wave frequency varies as @xmath78 , while the sublattice magnetization as @xmath79 ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the equation for @xmath80 at @xmath59 reads @xmath81 and has a more complicated form for higher spins @xcite .",
    "near the neel temperature tt yields at arbitrary @xmath82 and any space dimensionality @xmath83@xmath84 ^{1/2 }   \\label{magntbt}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is some function of @xmath82 , @xmath86 .",
    "thus , unlike sswt , the critical exponent for the magnetization has the standard mean - field value , @xmath87 .",
    "for small @xmath88 tt yields @xmath89 the result ( [ tntyab ] ) is lower than sswt value ( [ tnsswt ] ) and closed to experimental data ( see sect.5 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the result ( [ tntyab ] ) coincides with that of the spherical model ( which is adequate only in the classical limit @xmath90 @xcite ) and with the result of the spin - wave approximation ( [ tnsw ] ) in the classical regime @xmath91 the tyablikov approximation gives the same result ( [ tntyab ] ) ( with the replacement @xmath92 ) for the curie temperature of a ferromagnet ( @xmath93)@xmath10 this demonstrates that near the critical temperature tt does not take into account quantum fluctuations which are important for small values of @xmath82 .",
    "thus we may conclude that tt is satisfactory from the practical , but not from theoretical point of view .    to leading logarithmic accuracy",
    ", all the discussed approaches give the same value of the neel temperature .",
    "however , this accuracy is insufficient to treat experimental data . in particular ,",
    "the factor of @xmath94 in the classical regime is often not taken into account ( see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) , although this factor gives an essential contribution to @xmath95 .    to improve the description of the critical region and obtain a better appoximation for the neel temperature in the quantum case ,",
    "it is necessary to take into account fluctuation corrections to the spin - wave theory result for @xmath48 ( [ tnsw ] ) more correctly than in sswt and tt . to this end",
    "we use in the next sections the @xmath2-expansion in the @xmath1 model .",
    "to describe thermodynamics of quantum antiferromagnets we consider the nonlinear sigma - model which was proposed for the one - dimensional heisenberg model in ref.@xcite . in the 2d case this model was applied in refs .",
    "the large value of the correlation length @xmath96 ( @xmath97 is the lattice parameter in the plane ) plays the crucial role in the haldane s mapping of an antiferromagnetic heisenberg model ( [ heis ] ) to quantum nonlinear sigma - model ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . this gives a possibility to separate and integrate out the `` fast '' modes with space scale @xmath98 ( @xmath99 satisfies to @xmath100 ) retaining `` slow '' modes with @xmath101 .    in the quasi-2d case",
    "we have @xmath102 however , at small @xmath103 we have @xmath104 thus besides the `` true '' correlation length @xmath105 there exists also another variable with scaling dimensionality of length @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the interlayer coupling parameter ; in this paper we consider only the case where @xmath108 . on the scale of order of @xmath109 the regime of fluctuations changes from @xmath110 to @xmath22 one .",
    "thus we may use the scale @xmath109 to separate `` fast '' and `` slow '' modes in the haldane s mapping . depending on the value of the imaginary time slab thickness @xmath111 (",
    "@xmath112 is the fully renormalized spin - wave velocity ) , three regimes are possible ( i ) @xmath113 or , equivalently , @xmath114 this is an analog of the quantum critical regime @xmath115 in the 2d case @xcite    \\(ii ) @xmath116 i.e. @xmath117 which is an analog of the renormalized classical regime @xmath118 in the 2d case and    \\(iii ) the classical regime @xmath119 ( i.e. @xmath120 ) .    since the regime ( i ) is well described by the standard spin - wave theory ( or by sswt ) , we do not treat the thermodynamics at temperatures of order of @xmath121 . from ( [ tnsw ] ) and ( [ tnsswt ] )",
    "one can see that @xmath122 in the regimes ( ii ) and ( iii ) implementation of principles of finite - size scaling gives @xmath123 were @xmath124 is the fully renormalized spin stiffness , @xmath125 is a scaling function with @xmath126 in the regime ( ii ) we have @xmath127 so that @xmath128 while in the regime ( iii ) @xmath129 and @xmath130 note that the results of swt  ( [ tnsw ] ) and sswt ( [ tnsswt ] ) for the neel temperature agree with ( [ tnscal ] ) for the quantum regime and with ( [ tnscal1 ] ) for the classical regime . at the same time , the result of the tyablikov approximation ( [ tntyab ] ) satisfies the classical regime scaling form ( [ tnscal1 ] ) for all spin values , which confirms the absence of quantum fluctuations at the critical temperature in this approximation . as follows from ( [ tnscal1 ] ) , the value of neel temperature in the classical regime depends on fluctuations on a scale of order of lattice constant , i.e. is non - universal .",
    "therefore in this regime we can not eliminate `` fast '' modes by haldane s mapping .",
    "further we will assume that the `` renormalized classical '' regime ( ii ) takes place .",
    "we use the same procedure as used by haldane @xcite ( see full discussion in ref.@xcite ) to integrate out `` fast '' modes .",
    "thus the partition function has in terms of a path integral the form @xmath131 where @xmath132 is a three - component unit - length vector field , @xmath133 is the index of a site , @xmath134 is the uniform magnetic susceptibility . in the continual limit",
    "we reproduce the standard three - dimensional quantum nonlinear - sigma model .",
    "however , in the quasi-2d case the large value of @xmath109 gives a possibility to pass to the continual limit only within the layers : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is a 2d vector , @xmath137 is the index of a layer .",
