    "it is through the zeeman and hanle effects that the magnetic fields of the solar atmosphere leave their fingerprints in the polarization of the emergent spectral line radiation ( e.g. , casini & landi deglinnocenti 2007 ) .",
    "the art of  measuring \" solar magnetic fields thus relies on the development of suitable diagnostic tools based on such effects .",
    "the zeeman effect produces circular and linear polarization signals whose amplitudes are proportional to @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , with @xmath6 the ratio between the zeeman splitting and the doppler line - width .",
    "the hanle effect is the modification of the linear polarization produced by scattering processes in a spectral line , caused by the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "this line scattering polarization ( whose amplitude is proportional to the fractional anisotropy of the incident radiation ) is sensitive to magnetic strengths between approximately 0.2@xmath7 and 5@xmath7 , with @xmath7 the critical hanle field for which the zeeman splitting of the line s level under consideration is equal to its natural width .",
    "therefore , while the zeeman effect in the far - uv ( fuv ) and extreme - uv ( euv ) spectral lines that originate in the outer solar atmosphere is of limited practical interest for exploring its magnetism ( because @xmath8 ) , the hanle effect is of great diagnostic potential because its magnetic sensitivity is independent of the wavelength and doppler width of the spectral line under consideration .",
    "in this letter we report the first results of a theoretical investigation aimed at clarifying the full diagnostic capabilities of the mg  ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines at 2802.7    and 2795.5   , respectively , with emphasis on the linear polarization pattern produced by scattering processes .",
    "these strong resonance lines are of interest for probing the hot - temperature plasma of the upper solar chromosphere ( e.g. , uitenbroek 1997 ) .",
    "the mg  ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines result from two transitions between a common lower level with angular momentum @xmath9 and two upper levels with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively . as pointed out in previous theoretical investigations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , quantum interference between such excited @xmath2-levels is expected to produce observable effects in the wings of these lines , such as a cross - over of @xmath3 about the continuum polarization level in the spectral region between the two lines .",
    "this characteristic observational signature of @xmath2-state interference , pointed out by stenflo ( 1980 ) in the ca  ii h and k lines , is expected to be more significant for the mg  ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines because their wavelength separation and the ratio of the continuum to line opacity is much smaller than in the case of the ca  ii lines ( e.g. , see fig .  5 of * ?",
    "in fact , using the approximation of coherent scattering _ in the observer s frame _ , and simplifying the radiative transfer computations by assuming that the line source function and the integrated mean intensity are equal to the planck function , @xcite estimated values of @xmath3 of about 4% in the positive polarization maxima in the far wings , and of about -1.8% in the negative minimum between the two lines , for a line of sight ( los ) with @xmath11 ( with @xmath12 the heliocentric angle ) .",
    "another key physical ingredient for modeling the mg  ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines is partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) . as shown by radiative transfer calculations carried out using a two - level model atom , prd effects",
    "are expected to produce a conspicuous triplet peak @xmath3 signal in the core of the @xmath1 line ( e.g. , sampoorna et al .",
    "2010 ; see also figure  9 in trujillo bueno 2011 , obtained in collaboration with drs .",
    "m. sampoorna and j. tpn ) . however , since the dispersion wings of these lines are significantly overlapped and @xmath2-state interference can not be neglected , it is crucial to investigate the scattering polarization problem of the mg  ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 system accounting for the joint action of both prd and @xmath2-state interference effects .",
    "as we shall see below , our prd with @xmath2-state interference approach to this complex theoretical problem is not restricted to the line wings , so that our full radiative transfer calculations in model c of fontenla et al .",
    "( 1993 ; hereafter fal - c model ) allow us to provide information on the amplitude and shape of the @xmath3 signal throughout the whole profile .",
    "a correct modeling of the scattering polarization in the core of spectral lines is particularly important because it is precisely in this spectral line region where the hanle effect operates .",
    "we also provide estimates on the circular polarization induced by the longitudinal zeeman effect .",
    "a quantum mechanical derivation of the redistribution matrix for polarized radiation , for a two - level atom with unpolarized and infinitely sharp lower level , was carried out by @xcite and @xcite . in the atom rest frame ( where the frequency and angular dependencies can be factorized )",
    ", frequency redistribution is described by the linear combination of hummer s @xmath13 and @xmath14 functions ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which describe purely coherent scattering and completely redistributed scattering , respectively .",
    "the corresponding branching ratios for the @xmath15-th multipole component of the redistribution matrix are given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the broadening widths of the upper level due to radiative decays , superelastic collisions ( i.e. , collisional de - excitation ) , and elastic collisions , respectively , while @xmath20 is the depolarizing rate due to elastic collisions ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "note that the branching ratios given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : br_rii ] ) and ( [ eq : br_riii ] ) do not include the factor @xmath22 , with @xmath23 the photon destruction probability ( cf .",
    "( 54 ) and ( 55 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "their sum is equal to 1 for the @xmath24 multipole component ( @xmath25 ) , while in the presence of depolarizing collisions it is generally smaller than 1 for @xmath26 .    as mentioned in section 1 , quantum interference between different @xmath2 levels",
    "is expected to produce significant observable effects on the scattering polarization signal across the mg  ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines .",
    "an atomic model accounting for the contribution of @xmath2-state interference ( such as the two - term model atom presented in * ? ? ?",
    "* herefater ll04 ) is therefore needed for the investigation of this resonance doublet .",
    "unfortunately , a rigorous quantum mechanical derivation of the redistribution matrix for such an atomic model , in the presence of elastic and inelastic collisions , has not been carried out yet .",
    "nevertheless , the limit of coherent scattering _ in the atom rest frame _ is a reasonable approximation for modeling the scattering polarization across the mg  ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines .",
    "this can be clearly seen from fig .  1 , where the branching ratio @xmath27 corresponding to the @xmath1 line ( the one corresponding to the @xmath0 line is practically identical )",
    "is shown as a function of height in the fal - c model of the solar atmosphere .",
    "as shown in the figure , @xmath27 is indeed equal to one at the heights where the line - core optical depth is unity for an observation at @xmath28 , and it is very close to one also at the heights where the optical depth in the wavelength interval between the two lines is unity .    a quantum mechanical derivation of the redistribution matrix for a two - term atom with unpolarized , infinitely sharp lower levels , in the limit of purely coherent scattering in the atom s rest frame has been carried out by @xcite within the framework of the metalevels theory .",
    "this redistribution matrix is suitable for investigating the scattering polarization across the mg  ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines , since the lower level of these lines is the ground level ( it thus satisfies the hypothesis of an infinitely sharp lower level ) , and it has @xmath29 .",
    "such redistribution matrix was obtained by neglecting collisions , and is valid in the atom s rest frame . following a derivation analogous to the one presented in @xcite , we have calculated the corresponding expression in the observer s frame , taking doppler redistribution into account .",
    "an alternative derivation has been recently carried out by @xcite starting from the kramers - heisenberg scattering formula .",
    "we consider a two - term model atom for mg  ii , the lower term being composed of the ground level ( @xmath30 ) , the upper term of the upper levels of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively ) .",
    "although a rigorous derivation of the collisional rates in a two - term atom has not been carried out yet , we included the effect of ( isotropic ) inelastic and superelastic collisions in the redistribution matrix , under the following assumptions .",
    "we first assumed that the relaxation rate due to superelastic collisions is the same for the two upper @xmath2-levels ( see section 7.13 of ll04 for the explicit expressions of such rate ) .",
    "we then assumed that such collisional relaxation rate is also the one for the interference between the two upper @xmath2-levels .",
    "accordingly with the previous approximation , we calculated the inelastic collision transfer rates from the common lower level to the two upper levels .",
    "since the lower level is unpolarized , these latter collisions only affect the populations of the upper @xmath2-levels , and the corresponding rates are identical to the case of a multi - level atom ( see sect .",
    "7.13 of ll04 ) .",
    "collisional rates between pairs of @xmath2-levels pertaining to the same term have been neglected , as well as elastic collisions . under these hypotheses , following the convention according to which primed quantities refer to the incident photon , while unprimed quantities to the scattered photon , indicating with @xmath33 and @xmath34 the photon s frequency ( in the observer s frame ) and propagation direction , we obtained @xmath35_{ij }      \\nonumber \\\\      & & \\times \\frac{1}{\\pi \\ , \\delta \\nu^2_{\\!d } \\sin \\theta }       \\ , { \\rm exp } \\left [ -\\frac{(\\nu^{\\prime}-\\nu-      \\nu_{j^{\\prime}_{\\!\\ell } j^{}_{\\ell } } ) ^2 }      { 4 \\ , \\delta \\nu^{2}_{\\!d } \\sin^2(\\theta/2 ) } \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\      & & \\times \\frac{1 }      { 1 + \\epsilon^{\\prime }       + { \\rm i } \\frac{\\nu_{j^{\\prime}_{\\!u } j^{}_{\\!u}}}{2 \\gamma } }       \\,\\frac{1}{2 } \\,\\bigg [ w \\left ( \\frac{a}{\\cos(\\theta/2 ) } ,      \\frac{\\varv^{}_{j^{}_{\\!u } j^{}_{\\!\\ell } } +      \\varv^{\\prime}_{j^{}_{\\!u } j^{\\prime}_{\\!\\ell } } }      { 2\\cos(\\theta/2 ) } \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\      & & + w \\left ( \\frac{a}{\\cos(\\theta/2 ) } ,      \\frac { \\varv^{}_{j^{\\prime}_{\\!u } j^{}_{\\!\\ell } } +      \\varv^{\\prime}_{j^{\\prime}_{\\!u } j^{\\prime}_{\\!\\ell } } }      { 2\\cos(\\theta/2 ) } \\right)^{\\ast } \\bigg ] \\ , ,      \\label{eq : redistribution}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36_{ij}$ ] is the @xmath15-th multipole component of the scattering phase matrix ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath12 is the scattering angle",

    "( [ eq : redistribution ] ) , and of the damping parameter @xmath53 .",
    "in order to estimate , in the absence of magnetic fields , the amplitude and shape of the scattering polarization pattern across the mg  ii doublet , we have developed a non - lte radiative transfer code based on the angle averaged expression ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) of the redistribution matrix described in the previous section , including the contribution of an unpolarized continuum .",
    "the numerical method of solution will be explained in detail in a forthcoming publication ; it is based on a direct generalization to the prd case of the jacobian iterative scheme presented in trujillo bueno & manso sainz ( 1999 ) .",
    "the initialization of the iterative calculation was done using the self - consistent solution of the corresponding unpolarized problem , which we have obtained by applying uitenbroek s ( 2001 ) radiative transfer code .",
    "this code has also been used to compute the inelastic and elastic collisional rates , as well as the continuum total opacity ( including the uv line haze contribution ) and emissivity .    in figure 2",
    "we show the results of the following prd calculations of the @xmath3 profile of the emergent radiation for a line of sight with @xmath28 : ( 1 ) the full two - term atom solution obtained by taking into account the impact of interference between the two excited @xmath2-levels , ( 2 ) the two - term atom solution obtained by neglecting @xmath2-state interference effects , and ( 3 ) the solution for the mg  ii @xmath1-line alone assuming a two - level atom with @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the left panel of fig .  2 shows the overall structure of the @xmath3 profile .",
    "consider first the two - term atom solutions obtained by including ( solid line ) and neglecting ( dashed line ) @xmath2-state interference .",
    "clearly , the impact of @xmath2-state interference is very important , since it leads to much larger polarization amplitudes in the wings ( about 10% at around @xmath56    from the @xmath0 and @xmath1 line centers , respectively ) and to a significant negative polarization feature between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines with a maximum amplitude of about -2% .",
    "the two - level atom solution for the @xmath1 line ( dotted line ) produces wing polarization signals which are also significantly smaller than those corresponding to the full solution .    the right panel of fig .",
    "2 shows the details of the @xmath3 profile in the core regions of the mg  ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines .",
    "the three solutions perfectly agree in the core of the @xmath1 line , with a line - center amplitude of about 2% .",
    "however , it can be observed that the solution obtained by neglecting @xmath2-state interference ( dashed line ) does not show either the small asymmetry in the two negative @xmath3 peaks around the @xmath1-line core , or the clear antisymmetric @xmath3 feature that the combined action of prd and @xmath2-state interference effects produces around the center of the @xmath0 line ( whose polarizability is zero ) .",
    "although the hypothesis of purely coherent scattering in the atom s rest frame is a good approximation in the core of the lines and between them , frequency redistribution effects due to elastic collisions might not be completely negligible going towards the wings of the lines ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in order to have a qualitative idea of the impact of this physical ingredient , we carried out a calculation including the contribution of the @xmath14 redistribution function , under the limit of complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) in the observer s frame .",
    "we derived the expression of @xmath14 from the crd theory presented in ll04 , including the effect of inelastic and superelastic collisions as in the case of @xmath13 .",
    "we used the branching ratios @xmath27 and @xmath57 ) defined in eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ( strictly valid in the case of a two - level atom ) is included in our @xmath13 and @xmath14 redistribution functions . ] .",
    "we assumed @xmath58 ( i.e. we neglected the depolarizing effect of elastic collisions ) . as expected , the contribution of @xmath14 is negligible in the core of the lines , and very small between them .",
    "however , as shown in fig .",
    "3 , it modifies in an appreciable way the amplitude of the @xmath3 profile in the wings of the lines . note that the solution corresponding to the approximation of purely coherent scattering in the observer s frame is also shown in fig .",
    "3 ( see the filled circles ) .",
    "as shown in this letter , the physics that outside sunspots controls the scattering polarization of the mg ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines is the joint action of prd and @xmath2-state interference effects , which produces a complex @xmath3 pattern with sizable polarization maxima in the wings , and a negative polarization feature at wavelengths between the two line centers ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "these @xmath3 wing features can also be understood using the approximation of coherent scattering in the observer s frame ( see the filled circles in fig .",
    "3 ) and @xmath1 lines .",
    "although the statistical significance of such pioneering observations is very marginal , in a forthcoming investigation we will include the interaction with the continuum polarization processes in order to study its possible impact on the polarization amplitudes across these lines . ] .",
    "another remarkable feature of the @xmath3 profile we have obtained is a clear antisymmetric @xmath3 signal around the center of the @xmath0 line ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , which can only be found when taking into account the joint action of prd and @xmath2-state interference effects . in the core of the @xmath1 line ,",
    "prd effects alone are responsible of the triplet peak structure of the @xmath3 profile ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the reported linear polarization is sensitive to a magnetic field through the hanle effect , which operates only in the core of the @xmath1 line . here magnetic fields weaker than 100",
    "g are expected to produce significant changes in the line - center polarization amplitude . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , it is a good new that the @xmath3 profile around the core of the mg  ii @xmath1-line can be well modeled through the two - level atom approximation , since this will facilitate the development of hanle - effect diagnostic tools .",
    "in addition to the hanle effect in the @xmath1-line , complementary information on the magnetic field of the solar chromosphere could be obtained by measuring the circular polarization produced by the zeeman effect in all the mg  ii lines that are located between 2790    and 2805",
    "  ( see caption of fig .",
    "1 ) . the stokes @xmath59 signals of all these lines should be measurable .",
    "for example , a volume filling magnetic field of 100 g inclined by @xmath60 with respect to the los produces @xmath61 amplitudes of about 1% in all these mg  ii lines .",
    "spectroscopy of the mg  ii @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines with novel space telescopes like the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) will provide precious information on temperatures , flows and waves .",
    "however , the magnetic field information is encoded in the spectral line polarization , whose measurement with high spatial and/or temporal resolution requires the development of larger aperture telescopes such as solar - c ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the results shown in this letter for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lines of mg  ii , and in @xcite for the ly@xmath27 lines of h  i and he  ii , strongly encourage the development of fuv and euv spectro - polarimeters for the new generation of solar space telescopes .",
