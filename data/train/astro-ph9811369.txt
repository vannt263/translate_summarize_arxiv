    "observations of some x - ray pulsars show remarkable ` jumps ' between states where the pulsar is spin - ning - down to one where it is spinning - up .",

    "1993 ) and gx 1 + 4 ( chakrabarty et al . 1997 ; cui 1997 ) .",
    "the theoretical problem of disk accretion to a rotating magnetized star has been discussed in many works over a long period ( pringle & rees 1972 ; lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ; ghosh & lamb 1979 ; wang 1979 ; lipunov 1993 ; shu et al .",
    "1994 ; lovelace , romanova , & bisnovatyi - kogan 1995 ( hereafter lrbk ) ; li & wickramasinghe 1997 ) .",
    "however , except for the work by li & wickramasinghe ( 1997 ) , the studies do not specifically address the ` propeller ' regime ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) where the rapid rotation of the star s magnetosphere acts to expell most of the accreting matter and where the star spins - down .",
    "recent computer simulation studies of disk accretion to a rotating star with an aligned dipole magnetic field ( hayashi , shibata , & matsumoto 1996 ; goodson , winglee , & bhm 1997 ; miller & stone 1997 ) provide evidence of time - dependent outflows but do not give definite evidence for a ` propeller ' regime with spin - down of the star .",
    "the present work considers the ` propeller ' regime and develops a simple physical model where the energy and angular momentum lost by the rotating star goes into a magnetically driven outflow .",
    "we consider the problem of disk accretion onto a rotating magnetized star which has an aligned dipole magnetic field .",
    "we focus on the limit where the star is rotating rapidly and the disk - star configuration is as sketched in figure 1 ( see figure 3 of lrbk ) .",
    "we consider the flow of mass , angular momentum , and energy into and out of the annular region indicated by the box @xmath1 in this figure , where @xmath2 is at radius @xmath3 and @xmath4 is at @xmath5 .",
    "notice that at this point the values of @xmath3 and @xmath5 are _",
    "unknown_. they are determined by the physical considerations discussed here .",
    "consider first the outer surface @xmath4 through the disk .",
    "the influx of mass into the considered region is @xmath6_{2}~>0~ , \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the half - thickness of the disk , and the @xmath8 subscript indicates evaluation at @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that mass accretion rate for @xmath10 is approximately constant equal to @xmath11 .",
    "that is , we consider that outflow from the disk is negligible for @xmath12 .",
    "the influx of angular momentum into the considered region is @xmath13 here , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the viscous contribution to the stress tensor which includes _ both _ the turbulent hydrodynamic and turbulent magnetic stresses .",
    "the influx of energy into the considered region is @xmath16 where @xmath17 with @xmath18 the keplerian speed and @xmath19 the mass of the star , and where @xmath20 is the enthalpy . for conditions of interest here",
    "the disk at @xmath5 is geometrically thin so that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the sound speed .",
    "consider next the fluxes of mass , angular momentum , and energy across the surface @xmath23 in figure 1 .",
    "for the physical regime considered , where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 the angular rotation rate of the star ) , the mass accretion across the @xmath23 surface is assumed to be small compared with @xmath26 .",
    "the reason for this is that any plasma which crosses the @xmath23 surface will be ` spun - up ' to an angular velocity @xmath27 ( by the magnetic force ) which is substantially larger than the keplerian value , and thus it will be thrown outwards .",
    "thus the efflux of angular momentum across this surface from the considered region is @xmath28 the efflux of energy across this surface is @xmath29 where @xmath27 is the angular rotation rate of the star and the inner magnetosphere as shown in figure 1 . for the conditions considered , the star slows down and loses rotational energy so that @xmath30 .",
    "we have @xmath31 .",
    "because the interaction of the star with the accretion flow is by assumption entirely across the surface @xmath23 , this is consistent with the spin - down of a star with constant moment of inertia @xmath32 ; that is , @xmath33 .",
    "next we consider the mass , angular momentum , and energy fluxes across the surfaces @xmath34 and @xmath35 in figure 1 .",
    "as mentioned , accretion to the star is small for @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the corotation radius as indicated in figure 1 .",
    "thus , the mass accretion goes mainly into outflows , @xmath38 where `` @xmath39 '' stands for outflows .",
    "the angular momentum outflow across the surfaces @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath40 , must be the difference between the angular momentum lost by the star and the incoming angular momentum of the accretion flow .",
    "the angular momentum carried by radiation from the disk is negligible because @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the speed of light .",
    "that is , @xmath43 the energy outflow across the @xmath34 and @xmath35 surfaces is @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the radiation energy loss rate from the disk surfaces between @xmath46 and @xmath5 , and @xmath47 is the rate of energy loss carried by the outflows .",
    "angular momentum conservation gives @xmath48 we have @xmath49 we can solve equation ( 4 ) for @xmath50 and thereby eliminate this quantity from the energy equation ( 5 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath51    the preceeding equations are independent of the nature of the outflows from the disk .",
    "at this point we consider the case of magnetically driven outflows as treated by lovelace , berk , and contopoulos ( 1991 , hereafter lbc ) . in the lbc model",
    "the outflows come predominantly from an annular inner region of the disk of radius @xmath52 where the disk rotation rate is @xmath53 .",
    "thus we assume that the outflows come from a region of the disk which is approximately in keplerian rotation . for the present situation , shown in figure 1 ,",
    "it is clear that we must have @xmath54 further , we will assume @xmath0 is close in value to @xmath3 with @xmath55 . for conditions where the outflow from the disk is relatively low temperature ( sound speed much less than keplerian speed ) , equations ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) of lbc imply the general relation @xmath56 this equation can be used to eliminate @xmath40 in favor of @xmath47 in equation ( 6 ) .",
    "recalling that @xmath57 we have @xmath58 @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the energy dissipation in the region of the disk @xmath46 to @xmath5 heats the disk and this heat energy is transformed into outgoing radiation @xmath45 .",
    "thus we have @xmath61 ( shakura 1973 ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) , where @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the essential change in @xmath64 occurs in the vicinity of @xmath0 so that @xmath65 thus equation ( 7 ) becomes @xmath66 thus the power from the spin - down of the star @xmath67 must be larger than a certain value in order to drive the outflow .    for magnetically driven outflows ,",
    "the value of @xmath47 can be written as @xmath68 ( equation 34 of lbc ) , where @xmath69 is a dimensionless numerical constant @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the poloidal magnetic field at the base of the outflow at @xmath72 .",
    "we take the simple estimate @xmath73 which omits corrections for example for compression of the star s field by the inflowing plasma .",
    "next we consider the torque on the star @xmath74 .",
    "because most of the matter inflowing in the accretion disk at @xmath9 is driven off in outflows at distances @xmath75 , the stress is necessarily due to the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field in the vicinity of @xmath3 has an essential time - dependence owing to the continual processes of stellar flux leaking outward into the disk , the resulting field loops being inflated by the differential rotation ( lrbk ) , and the reconnection between the open disk field and the closed stellar field loops .",
    "the time scale of these processes is @xmath76 .",
    "we make the estimate of the torque @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the vertical half - thickness of the region where the magnetic stress is significant , and where the angular brackets denote a time average of the field quantites at @xmath79 .",
    "the magnetic field components , @xmath80 , with @xmath81 necessarily , must be of magnitude less than or of the order of the dipole field @xmath82 at @xmath46 .",
    "the fact that @xmath83 has the opposite sign to that of @xmath84 is due to the fact that the @xmath83 field arises differential rotation between the region @xmath85 , which rotates at rate @xmath27 , and the region @xmath75 , which rotates at rate @xmath86 . also , it is reasonable to assume @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , @xmath88 where @xmath89 ( the time average of @xmath90 ) is a dimensionless constant analogous to the @xmath91parameter of shakura ( 1973 ) and shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) .",
    "( note that because @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are of the same order of magnitude . )",

    "note that the assumptions leading to equation ( 12 ) require @xmath116 .",
    "notice that @xmath0 ( or @xmath117 ) is the _ effective _ alfvn radius for a _ rotating _ star .",

    "figure 2 shows the dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath115 and @xmath37 for a sample case . for conditions of a newly formed disk around a young pulsar , the initial system point would be on the upper left - hand part of the curve . due to",

    "over a long interval , @xmath0 will decrease to a value larger than @xmath37 but not much larger . in this limit ,",
    "mass accretion to the star @xmath130 may become significant .",

    "further spin - down of the star is impossible . at this point of the evolution ,",
    "the only possibility is a transition to the spin - up regime . in this regime",
    "the effective alfvn radius is the ` turnover radius ' @xmath137 of the disk rotation curve calculated by lrbk , the star spins - up at the rate @xmath138 , and most of the disk accretion @xmath26 falls onto the star .",

    "the locations of the jumps in the @xmath154 plane may in fact be a stochastic or chaotic in nature and give rise to chaotic hysteresis in the of the spin - down / spin - up behavior of the pulsar .",
    "the jumps could be triggered by small variations in the accretion flow ( @xmath120 for example ) and magnetic field configuration ( the time - dependence of @xmath155 in the torque @xmath74 ) .",

    "this work presents a new investigation of the ` propeller ' regime of disk accretion to a rapidly rotating magnetized star .",
    "the work considers the field configuration proposed by lrbk , the theory of lbc on magnetically driven jets , and the conservation of mass , angular momentum , and energy to derive an expression for the effective alfvn radius @xmath0 ( equation 12 ) and the spin - down torque on the star @xmath74 ( equation 11 ) .",
    "our work is in qualitative accord with that of li and wickramasinghe ( 1997 ) who also consider the propeller effect of illarionov and sunyaev ( 1975 ) .",

    "the model points to a mechanism for ` jumps ' between spin - down and spin - up evolution ( and the reverse transition ) . in our picture , in a spin - down to spin - up transition , for example , the effective alfvn radius decreases by an appreciable factor going from @xmath162 to @xmath163 .",
    "the propeller goes from being `` on '' to being `` off '' in this transistion , which is a change between two possible equilibrium configurations .",
