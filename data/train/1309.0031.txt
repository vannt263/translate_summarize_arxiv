    "we have calculated the metric up to the first post - newtonian order as displayed in equation  . from our calculation",
    "we obtained expressions for the effective gravitational constant   and the ppn parameters @xmath0   and @xmath1  .",
    "in the next section we will show how these results can be compared to measurements of the ppn parameters , and which restrictions arise on the scalar - tensor theories we consider .",

    "we discuss restrictions on these coefficients which arise from measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the solar system .",
    "we thereby neglect the terms involving @xmath119 and @xmath120 , since their contribution to the ppn parameters at large distances is subleading to that of @xmath96 and @xmath100 , as we argued in the previous section .",
    "the ppn parameters have been measured by various high precision experiments in the solar system  @xcite . in this article",

    "the experiment yielded the value @xmath128 .",
    "the radio signals were passing by the sun at a distance of @xmath129 solar radii or @xmath130 . *",
    "the most well - known test of the parameter @xmath1 is the perihelion precession of mercury  @xcite .",
    "its precision is limited by measurements of other contributions to the perihelion precession , most importantly the solar quadrupole moment @xmath131 .",

    "we take the semi - major axis of mercury , which is @xmath133 .",
    "* the tightest bounds on @xmath1 are obtained from lunar laser ranging experiments searching for the nordtvedt effect , which would cause a different acceleration of the earth and the moon in the solar gravitational field  @xcite . for fully conservative theories with no preferred frame effects",
    "the current bound is @xmath134 .",
    "since the effect is measured using the solar gravitational field , the interaction distance is @xmath135 .",
    "there are more recent experiments which we will not use here since they can not be characterized by a single value @xmath125 for the interaction distance .",
    "these include in particular combined vlbi measurements of @xmath0 at elongation angles between 5and 30  @xcite and measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 using ephemeris for a large number of celestial bodies in the solar system  @xcite .",
    "one may argue that also the measurements of @xmath0 listed above can not be characterized by a single interaction distance , since the distance between the sun and the radio signals varies along their path .",
    "a rigorous treatment would therefore require a calculation of null geodesics in the solar system  @xcite .",
    "we will not enter this calculation here and instead assume that the dominant gravitational interaction occurs at the shortest distance to the sun .",
    "the constraints on the values of the expansion coefficients @xmath96 and @xmath100 obtained from the experiments listed above can be visualized by plotting the experimentally excluded regions in parameter space , where we use coordinates @xmath136 , measured in inverse astronomical units @xmath137 , and @xmath96 .",

    "we finally compared our results to measurements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the solar system and obtained bounds on the constants @xmath96 and @xmath100 .",
    "it turned out that the strictest bounds are obtained from measurements of @xmath0 by cassini tracking , so that the current measurements of @xmath1 place no further restrictions on @xmath96 and @xmath100 . in order to obtain new bounds it would be necessary to measure the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 at higher precision or at shorter interaction distances between the gravitational source and the test mass .",
    "the latter would allow probing and possibly excluding larger values of @xmath100 , corresponding to a higher mass of the scalar field .",
    "the work presented in this article allows for various further studies .",
    "while we have restricted ourselves to a calculation of the ppn parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 for a static point mass , one may ask which further contributions to the post - newtonian metric arise from moving sources or sources with non - vanishing pressure , internal energy or gravitational self - energy .",
    "a calculation of these contributions would provide insight into further ppn parameters , which are related to preferred - frame and preferred - location effects .",
    "comparison of these parameters with their values measured in the solar system may place further bounds on viable theories of scalar - tensor gravity .",
    "another line of investigation would be the case of strong fields provided by , e.g. , binary pulsars .",
