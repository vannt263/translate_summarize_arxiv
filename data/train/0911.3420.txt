    "short range repulsive forces between atoms and molecules in soft condensed matter are often modeled by an effective hard core , which governs the proximity of neighbors .",
    "since the attractive interaction with a few nearest neighbors usually dominates the potential energy , the distance of closest approach is a key parameter in statistical descriptions of condensed phases .",
    "simple atoms and molecules with spherical symmetry can be viewed as having spherical hard cores ; the distance of closest approach of the centers of identical hard spheres in 3-d or of hard circles in 2-d is the diameter . for non - spherical molecules , such as the constituents of liquid crystals , the distance depends on orientation , and its calculation is surprisingly difficult @xcite .",
    "the simplest smooth non - spherical shapes are the ellipse and the ellipsoid .",
    "although overlap criteria have been developed for use in computer simulations , no analytic solutions for the distance of closest approach have been obtained for ellipsoids in 3-d , or , up to now , for ellipses in 2-d .",
    "the problem of determining the distance of closest approach for two ellipses is particularly intriguing because of its seductive apparent simplicity problem . we have recently succeeded in deriving an analytic expression for the distance of closest approach of the centers of two arbitrary hard ellipses as function of their orientation relative to the line joining their centers .",
    "we describe our method for solving this problem , give the solution , illustrate our results , and discuss its usefulness in modeling and simulating systems of anisometric particles such as liquid crystals .",
    "we consider two ellipses @xmath0 and @xmath1 in 2d with semi - axes lengths @xmath2 and @xmath3where @xmath4 , eccentricity @xmath5 , and major axes oriented along the unit vectors @xmath6",
    ". initially the ellipses are distant so that they have no point in common .",
    "one ellipse is then translated towards the other along the line joining their centers until they are in point contact externally ( see fig .  [ fig - ellipse ] ) .",
    "the problem is to find the distance @xmath7 between centers when the ellipses are so tangent ; that is , to find the distance of closest approach .",

    "the vector joining the centers is given by @xmath12 @xmath13 is a given unit vector .",
    "our goal is to find the distance @xmath7 as function of ellipse parameters @xmath14 and orientations @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is tempting to seek a solution by solving the quadratic equations    @xmath18    and@xmath19simultaneously for the points of intersection , and then requiring that the distance @xmath7 between centers be such that there is intersection exactly at one point .",
    "this approach fails for the following reason : although the components of @xmath20 at the points of intersection can be obtained by solving a quartic equation ( say for the @xmath21-component of @xmath20 ) , the condition requiring that the quartic have exactly one double real root is not straightforward to implement ( there are four roots , and it is not clear which two roots need to coalesce to yield the required tangency condition ) and it further gives an equation in @xmath7 whose order is higher than quartic , and which can not therefore be solved analytically .",
    "our approach proceeds via three steps :    \\(1 ) transformation of the two tangent ellipses @xmath0 and @xmath1 , whose centers are joined by the vector @xmath22 , into a circle @xmath23 and an ellipse @xmath24 , whose centers are joined by the vector @xmath25 . the circle @xmath26 and the ellipse @xmath24 remain tangent after the transformation .",

    "the excluded area , discussed above , is a key parameter in statistical models @xcite which can be calculated for ellipses from our result .",
    "another potential application is in the theory of nematic liquid crystals .",
    "one important contribution to the elastic constants of nematics is due to anisotropic dispersion forces .",
    "the average van der waals interaction energy of a molecule with its neighbors is an algebraic function of the distance of closest approach .",
    "the origin of three distinct elastic constants in nematics is still unresolved",
    ". our result may be useful in modeling elastic constants in 2-d nematics , and possibly giving insights towards understanding their origins in general .",
    "monte carlo calculations have played an important role in modeling the phase behavior of isotropic fluids and liquid crystals .",
    "vieillard - baron developed the first overlap criterion for identical hard ellipses @xcite .",
    "he derived a contact function @xmath160 such that @xmath161 when the ellipses are tangent ( either exteriorly or interiorly ) , and this function is positive and at least one of two auxiliary functions are negative if the ellipses have no real point in common .",
    "this overlap criterion has been used in monte - carlo simulations of hard ellipse systems .",
    "it may be possible to solve @xmath162 for @xmath7 ( this involves solving a quartic equation ) , and thus obtain a result similar to ours ; to our knowledge this has not yet been done .",
    "however , vieillard - baron s contact function @xmath163 is only valid for identical ellipses , and so this result would not be as general as ours , presented here .    according to the hohenberg - mermin - wagner theorem ,",
    "long range order corresponding to broken continuous symmetry is not allowed in 2d systems with short - range interactions @xcite .",
    "the possibility of long - range order in 2d nematics has been discussed theoretically @xcite and examined using monte - carlo simulations with lennard - jones like potentials as well as with hard rods . although it has been shown that true long range order can not exist if the interparticle potential is separable into a positional and an orientational part tobochnik&c83 , it is not clear what the implications are for systems of hard ellipses .",
    "frenkel has shown that only quasi - long range order exists for hard spherocylinders , that is , the correlations in orientational order decay algebraically .",
    "hard ellipsoids , however , can show dramatically different behavior from hard spherocylinders allen&e&f&m93 ( hard ellipses do not form smectic phases , whereas spherocylinders do ) , and for this reason monte carlo simulations of hard ellipses , on systems larger than studied by vieillard - baron , would be of considerable interest .",
    "our result for the distance provides an overlap criterion which could be usefully applied here .",
    "another area of interest is phase separation in hard particle systems .",
    "for example , simulations of hard disks and hard parallel squares have been studied , and phase separation has been observed .",
    "theoretical studies , on the other hand predict no phase separation in 2d . our results could provide the criterion for the overlap of ellipses of different sizes , and thus enable monte - carlo simulations of binary mixtures of hard ellipses .",
    "vieillard - baron also provides an overlap criterion for two identical ellipsoids of revolution in 3d @xcite .",
    "this involves the evaluation of a contact function @xmath164 and five auxiliary functions , three of which must be non - negative and at least one among the remaining three must be negative to avoid overlap .",
    "perram and wertheim provided a more general overlap criterion for hard ellipsoids .",
    "their scheme for evaluating the criterion involves an iterative numerical technique to find the maximum of a scalar function .",
    "our results can provide the basis of a simple algorithm to determine the distance of closest approach of two ellipsoids in 3d .",
    "this involves passing a plane through the line joining the centers of the two ellipsoids , determining the distance of closest approach of the ellipses in the plane , then rotating the plane and finding the largest such distance .",
    "the details of this algorithm will be published elsewhere .",
    "we have derived an analytic expression for the distance of closest approach of two hard ellipses with arbitrary orientation in 2d .",
    "the strategy is to transform the ellipses into a circle and a new ellipse by a scaling transformation .",
    "the relation between the position of a point on the ellipse and the normal at that point allows the tangency condition between the circle and ellipse to be written as a simple vector equation with two unknowns , which may be solved analytically for the distance between the centers .",
    "the solution requires the solution of a quartic equation , whose single positive real root can be uniquely determined .",
    "the final result for the distance is obtained by the inverse scaling transformation .",
