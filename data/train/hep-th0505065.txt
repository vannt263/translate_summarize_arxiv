    "in recent years there has been a growing attention to braneworld scenarios , in which our observable universe is realized as a brane embedded in a higher dimensional bulk spacetime  @xcite . among various models a simple setup called the randall - sundrum type ii model  @xcite is of particular interest because , despite gravity propagating into an infinite extra dimension , four - dimensional general relativity can be recovered on the brane due to the warped geometry of anti - de sitter spacetime  @xcite .",
    "cosmological consequences of the randall - sundrum type braneworld have been widely discussed  @xcite , especially regarding cosmological perturbations  @xcite .",
    "the generation and evolution of perturbations are among the most important issues in cosmology because of their direct link to cosmological observations such as the stochastic gravitational wave background and the temperature anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , by which we can probe the early universe .",
    "while the cosmological perturbation theory in the conventional four - dimensional universe is rather established  @xcite , calculating cosmological perturbations in the braneworld still remains to be a difficult problem .",
    "although some attempts have been made concerning scalar perturbations  @xcite , further progress is awaited to give a clear prediction about the cmb anisotropy in the randall - sundrum braneworld .",
    "almost the same is true for gravitational wave ( tensor ) perturbations  @xcite .",
    "however , since their generation and evolution depend basically only on the background geometry , they are slightly easier to handle .    during inflation super - horizon",
    "gravitational wave perturbations are generated from vacuum fluctuations of gravitons .",
    "the pure de sitter braneworld is the special case that allows definite analytical computation of quantum fluctuations .",
    "thanks to the symmetry of the de sitter group , the perturbation equation becomes separable and can be solved exactly  @xcite .",
    "the time variation of the hubble parameter generally causes mixing of a massless zero mode and massive kaluza - klein modes , and this effect was investigated based on the `` junction '' models , which assume an instantaneous transition from a de sitter to a minkowski brane  @xcite or to another de sitter brane  @xcite .",
    "these works discussed the quantum - mechanical generation of gravitational waves within such limited and simplified models .",
    "as for the classical evolution of gravitational waves during the radiation dominated epoch , several studies have been done  @xcite , assuming that a given single initial mode for each comoving wave number dominates .",
    "the focus of these works is mainly on the evolution of modes which re - enter the horizon in the high - energy regime . while the late time evolution is worked out analytically in refs .",
    "@xcite by resorting to low - energy approximation methods .    in this paper",
    "we consider the generation of primordial gravitational waves during inflation in more general models of the randall - sundrum type .",
    "for definiteness , we adopt a simple setup in which both initial and final phases are described by de sitter braneworlds .",
    "two de sitter phases with different values of the hubble expansion rate are smoothly interpolated .",
    "this work is an extension of the work on the `` junction '' models by the present authors in collaboration with h.  kudoh  @xcite . in the previous analysis",
    "the transition of the hubble rate was abrupt and the gap was assumed to be infinitesimal .",

    "this is the standard flat spectrum up to the overall factor @xmath52 . in conventional four - dimensional cosmology the power spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves from de sitter inflation",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath53 thus just by rescaling the amplitude in four - dimensional cosmology as @xmath54 the braneworld result  ( [ desitter_5d ] ) is exactly obtained .",
    "pure de sitter inflation on the brane described in the previous subsection is a special case where the amplitude of the growing zero mode can be obtained completely analytically . as a next step to understand gravitational waves from more general inflation with @xmath55 const , a discontinuous change in the hubble parameter was considered in ref .",
    "in such a `` junction '' model the hubble parameter is given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 is assumed .",
    "the evolution of gravitational wave perturbations can be analyzed by solving the equation of motion backward using the advanced green s function  @xcite .",
    "a set of mode functions can be constructed for the initial de sitter stage , and another for the final de sitter stage , either of which forms a complete orthonormal basis for the graviton wave function . the final ( growing ) zero mode may be written as a linear combination of the initial zero and kk modes .",
    "the bogoliubov coefficients give the creation rate of final zero mode gravitons from the initial vacuum fluctuations in the kaluza - klein modes as well as in the zero mode .",
    "thus the power spectrum may be written as a sum of two separate contributions , @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the parts coming from the initial zero and kaluza - klein modes , respectively .",
    "an important result brought by analyzing this junction model is that @xmath61 is well approximated by the rescaled spectrum @xmath62 obtained by using a simple map speculated by the exact result of pure de sitter inflation [ eq .",
    "( [ mapds ] ) ] .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath63 be the gravitational wave spectrum evaluated in the standard four - dimensional inflationary universe with the same time dependence of the hubble parameter  ( [ dis_hub ] ) , and then the rescaled spectrum is defined by @xmath64 comparing the rescaled spectrum with @xmath61 obtained from a five - dimensional calculation , one finds that the difference between these two is suppressed to be second order like  @xcite @xmath65 it might be worth noting here that the kk contribution @xmath60 is necessary for realizing this interesting agreement between the braneworld result and the ( basically ) four - dimensional result especially at high energies @xmath66 . the above agreement ( [ agreement ] ) raised a speculation that the mapping formula @xmath67 may work with good accuracy in more general inflation models with a smoothly changing expansion rate .",
    "the central purpose of the present paper is to check whether this speculation is correct or not .",
    "now let us explain the formulation that we use to study the generation of gravitational waves without assuming a pure de sitter brane .",
    "our formulation is based on double null coordinates , which are presumably the most convenient for numerical calculations .",

    "when inflation on the brane deviates from pure de sitter one , the decomposition into the zero mode and kk modes becomes rather ambiguous .",

    "<S> we study the quantum - mechanical generation of gravitational waves during inflation on a brane embedded in a five - dimensional anti - de sitter bulk . to make the problem well - posed , we consider the setup in which both initial and final phases are given by a de sitter brane with different values of the hubble expansion rate . assuming that the quantum state is in a de sitter invariant vacuum in the initial de sitter phase , we numerically evaluate the amplitude of quantum fluctuations of the growing solution of the zero mode in the final de sitter phase . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the vacuum fluctuations of the initial kaluza - klein gravitons as well as of the zero mode gravitons contribute to the final amplitude of the zero mode on small scales , and the power spectrum is quite well approximated by what we call the rescaled spectrum , which is obtained by rescaling the standard four - dimensional calculation following a simple mapping rule . </S>",
