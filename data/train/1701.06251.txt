    "titanium dioxide tio@xmath4 is extensively studied as a functional material with the potential of being used in various technological applications such as photocatalysis , photovoltaics , and oxide electronics.@xcite one of the most interesting applications is the photocatalysis of water into hydrogen and oxygen gas.@xcite however , the experimental optical band gap of tio@xmath4 is 3.0  ev in rutile and 3.2  ev in anatase phase .",
    "@xcite therefore pristine tio@xmath4 is not photoactive under a large part of the solar spectrum.@xcite however , to improve water splitting efficiency , it is not enough to just reduce the band gap .",
    "tio@xmath4 must maintain appropriate band energy alignment with water oxidation and reduction levels . while the conduction band in tio@xmath4 is already aligned well with water reduction level ,",
    "its valence band is too low in energy . in order to optimize the photocatalytic performance ,",
    "the band - gap reduction in titanium oxide must come from an upward energy shift of the valence band , not from a downward shift of the conduction band .",
    "@xcite    several methods such as impurity doping and forming solid solutions have been proposed in earlier reports to improve photocatalytic activity of tio@xmath4 under visible light.@xcite as for the solid - solution method , the tio@xmath4-zro@xmath4 solid solution was reported to have the absorption tail in the visible - light region.@xcite also , the reduction of the band gap was theoretically predicted for the taon - tio@xmath4 solution.@xcite on the other hand , nitrogen doping was shown to add the absorption tail in the visible - light region by asahi et al.@xcite and this was followed with many other experimental and theoretical studies.@xcite the effectiveness of the nitrogen doping is derived from the fact that atomic @xmath5 nitrogen states are higher in energy than atomic @xmath5 oxygen states .",
    "therefore nitrogen doping raises the valence band of tio@xmath4 as it is formed primarily from oxygen @xmath5 states.@xcite    however , nitrogen doping into tio@xmath4 does not give a new peak in the visible - light region .",
    "instead , it just adds a shoulder to the original peak in the ultraviolet region.@xcite most likely , this happens because the nitrogen concentration is so small that the absorption via the nitrogen - induced states only occurs around the nitrogen dopants .",
    "therefore , to enhance visible - light absorption with nitrogen doping , it is necessary to increase the nitrogen concentration level . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the highest reported nitrogen concentration in tio@xmath4 is 15  % .@xcite several studies suggested that oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in stabilizing nitrogen substitution,@xcite as is expected from the electron - counting rule .",
    "since concentration of oxygen vacancies in native tio@xmath4 such as rutile or anatase is relatively low , there is a natural limit to the amount of nitrogen one can substitute into tio@xmath4 .",
    "here we propose an alternative way to achieve much higher nitrogen concentrations in titanium oxide systems . instead of focusing on tio@xmath4 stoichiometry with a limited number of native oxygen vacancies , we consider here ordered compounds with composition ti@xmath6o@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is any positive integer .",
    "these systems can be viewed as ordered oxygen - deficient variants of tio@xmath4 with a large concentration of oxygen vacancies .",
    "since oxygen vacancies stabilize nitrogen substitutions , one can expect that these systems could achieve much higher nitrogen concentrations than tio@xmath4 .",
    "the compound with @xmath3 has the well known corundum structure as its ground state@xcite while the structures of @xmath9 compounds are known as magnli phases .",
    "@xcite    since the nominal titanium valency in ti@xmath6o@xmath7 is less than + iv , one might expect them to be metallic due to partially occupied @xmath10-levels on titanium .",
    "however , it is found experimentally that corundum ti@xmath4o@xmath11 and several magnli phases exhibit the metal - insulator transition@xcite with a small charge - ordering gap one or two orders of magnitude less than in tio@xmath4.@xcite ( the values of the charge - order gap in these systems are between 27 and 250  mev .",
    "@xcite ) therefore , to achieve large - gap insulating state without charge ordering , one needs to replace two out of @xmath12 oxygen atoms with nitrogen , thus achieving composition @xmath13 restoring the highly stable + iv valency of titanium .",
    "we propose this as a purely insulating titanium oxynitride .",
    "it is highly notable that this approach has high controllability over electronic properties since one can tune the nitrogen concentration while keeping the titanium valency + iv by choosing the appropriate value for @xmath8 .",
    "nitrogen substitution into ti@xmath6o@xmath7 systems was first reported by hyett and his co - workers for the @xmath14 case ( ti@xmath15o@xmath16n , @xmath17)@xcite and later extended to larger @xmath8 ( @xmath18 ) cases by mikami and ozaki ( ti@xmath6(o , n)@xmath7).@xcite however , the resistivity of their samples is quite low ( 101000 @xmath19@xmath20 m )",
    ". therefore these samples are likely quite far away from the ideal ti@xmath6n@xmath4o@xmath2 configuration .",
    "as far as we know , insulating solid material with nominal ti@xmath6n@xmath4o@xmath2 configuration has not been synthesized up to now while there is an experimental report on the existence of molecules with the composition ti@xmath4n@xmath4o , which corresponds to the @xmath3 case .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , theoretical prediction of ti@xmath6n@xmath4o@xmath2 solid compounds has been done for the @xmath14 case ( ti@xmath11n@xmath4o@xmath11 ) by wu and his co - workers via a high throughput screening method within the density functional theory ( dft).@xcite they predicted ti@xmath11n@xmath4o@xmath11 based on the structure of ta@xmath11n@xmath21,@xcite which is almost isomorphic to the @xmath22-ti@xmath11o@xmath21 structure . within the @xmath23-sol method they obtained the band gap of 2.37  ev with a favorable band - edge position for water splitting.@xcite    in this paper , we focus on the oxynitride ti@xmath4n@xmath4o ( @xmath3 case ) with corundum - like structure since it has the highest nitrogen concentration among all @xmath24 .",
    "however , our conclusions might extend to magnli phases ( @xmath9 ) as well .",
    "in addition , we study nitrogen - doped tio@xmath4 so that we can compare the nitrogen substitutional energy and the electronic structure with those of ti@xmath4n@xmath4o .",
    "our electronic - structure calculations are based on the framework of the density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite we also employ the gw approach@xcite to compute quasiparticle band structures of pristine tio@xmath4 .    in dft calculations we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite with the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange - correlation functional.@xcite",
    "we expand the kohn - sham orbitals in plane - wave expansion with the cut - off energy of 200 ry .",
    "we employ the pseudopotential method with the troullier - martins norm - conserving pseudopotentials .",
    "@xcite we generated pseudopotentials for ti , o , and n with the charged ti@xmath25 and neutral o and n configurations . in generating the pseudopotential for ti ,",
    "the @xmath26 and @xmath27 semicore states are treated as valence states and the cutoff radii for the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 states are set to be 0.90  @xmath29 , 0.90  @xmath29 , and 1.00  @xmath29 , respectively , where @xmath29 is the bohr radius . in generating the pseudopotentials for o and n ,",
    "the cutoff radii both for the @xmath30 and @xmath5 states are set to be 1.05 @xmath29 .",
    "the k - points sampling is performed using the monkhorst - pack method@xcite with 4@xmath314@xmath316 , 4@xmath314@xmath312 , and 6@xmath316@xmath312 grids for the primitive unit cell of rutile tio@xmath4 , and the conventional unit cells of anatase tio@xmath4 and corundum ti@xmath4o@xmath11 , respectively . for metallic systems",
    ", we use the methfessel - paxton first - order spreading with the searing of 0.01  ry in the brillouin - zone integration .",
    "@xcite the structural optimization is performed based on the wentzcovitch damped molecular dynamics .",
    "@xcite the electronic - structure calculation within the dft is performed using the quantum espresso package .",
    "@xcite    quasiparticle band structures are calculated by the one - shot gw approach@xcite within the generalized plasmon - pole ( gpp ) model .",
    "@xcite as the starting point for the one - shot gw calculation , we use the dft results obtained through the above - mentioned dft methodology .",
    "the number of the calculated bands within the dft calculation is 1000 per tio@xmath4 formula unit .",
    "the frequency cut - off for the dielectric matrix calculation is set to be 40  ry .",
    "these parameters for the gw calculation were confirmed to give well converged results in a recent gw study for rutile tio@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite the gw calculation is performed using the berkeleygw package .",
    "in this section , we discuss structural models of nitrogen - substituted tio@xmath4 and ti@xmath4o@xmath11 used in our study .      figure  [ pristinestructure ] shows the crystal structure of pristine rutile and anatase tio@xmath4 , which are representative phases among tio@xmath4 polymorphs .",
    "rutile has a primitive tetragonal structure with the space group @xmath32 .",
    "its unit cell contains two tio@xmath4 formula units .",
    "anatase has a body - centered tetragonal structure with the space group @xmath33 .",
    "its primitive unit cell also contains only two tio@xmath4 units .",
    "all oxygen sites in rutile and anatase are crystallographically equivalent .",
    "therefore , there is only one symmetry equivalent way to substitute a single oxygen atom with a nitrogen atom in these structures . in our calculation",
    "we replace one out of thirty - two oxygen atoms with nitrogen , both in rutile and anatase phase .",
    "after this substitution we fully relax the internal structural coordinates and lattice constants . in the case of rutile",
    "this requires a 2@xmath312@xmath312 supercell and in the case of anatase 2@xmath312@xmath311 supercell of its conventional unit cell .",
    "these supercells are shown in fig .",
    "[ nti - st ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     substituting nitrogen into either rutile or anatase tio@xmath4 induces localized states just above the valence band maximum .",
    "these localized states are 0.25  ev above valence bands in rutile and 0.20  ev in anatase . in both cases",
    "fermi level is crossing the localized band .",
    "however , nitrogen substitution not only introduces localized states , but also shifts valence and conduction bands relative to the undoped case . as a result , upon nitrogen substitution , the gap of rutile tio@xmath4 shifts from 3.14  ev to 3.11  ev while the gap of anatase tio@xmath4 changes from 3.55  ev to 2.98  ev .",
    "similar band - edge shifts are also predicted in a previous dft study .",
    "@xcite    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] in pristine and nitrogen substituted rutile and anatase tio@xmath4 the valence band is composed mostly of oxygen @xmath34 states , while the isolated impurity band is dominated by the nitrogen @xmath34 states .",
    "now we discuss electronic structure of seven nitrogen - substituted ( ti@xmath4n@xmath4o ) models .",
    "we find that all seven models are semiconducting as expected from the electron - counting rule .",
    "the calculated band - gap values of ti@xmath4n@xmath4o models range from 1.81 to 2.32  ev . among the seven ti@xmath4n@xmath4o models ,",
    "ti@xmath4n@xmath4o - i has the smallest band gap .",
    "this model is also energetically the most stable one .",
    "the band gap of ti@xmath4n@xmath4o - i is therefore significantly smaller than that of pristine rutile , anatase , or even nitrogen - doped rutile and anatase .",
    "in addition , in ti@xmath4n@xmath4o , the top of the conduction band is not formed by the localized band as in the case of nitrogen substituted rutile and anatase .    however , as discussed earlier , photocatalytic activity of tio@xmath4 depends not only on the electronic band gap but it depends also on energy level alignment .",
    "we find that the top of the valence band of the seven ti@xmath4n@xmath4o models are higher than that of pristine rutile tio@xmath4 by 0.961.76 ev .",
    "this alignment is therefore more preferable for water splitting purposes .",
    "conduction band minimum of most ti@xmath4n@xmath4o models are higher than that of pristine rutile tio@xmath4 .",
    "the most stable model ( i ) had nearly the same conduction band maximum as pristine rutile tio@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , the reduction of band - gap values in ti@xmath4n@xmath4o is achieved mostly by the upward shift of vbm , not by the downward shift of cbm .",
    "therefore ti@xmath4n@xmath4o possesses suitable band - edge position for photocatalytic water decomposition . in all the ti@xmath4n@xmath4o models ,",
    "the upper part of the valence band is composed of mainly nitrogen 2@xmath34 states , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] .",
    "this result shows the effectiveness of nitrogen substitution to shift up the vbm and thus to form a narrower band gap .",
    "the amount of band - edge shift in ti@xmath4n@xmath4o - i , the most stable model , is highly notable because it is the most likely candidate among the seven models .",
    "its vbm and cbm shifts from those of pristine rutile tio@xmath4 are 1.34  ev and 0.01  ev in the upward direction , respectively .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a general approach to obtain a variety of purely insulating titanium oxynitride compounds ti@xmath6n@xmath4o@xmath2 and we conducted detailed analyses in the cases with the highest nitrogen concentration ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the resulting oxynitride , ti@xmath4n@xmath4o , is predicted to have suitable band - edge position for photocatalytic water decomposition .",
    "its band gap ( 1.81  ev ) is much smaller in pristine tio@xmath4 ( 3.143.55  ev ) .",
    "importantly , most of the band gap reduction originates from the upward shift in energy of the valence band maximum .",
    "furthermore , the energy required to substitute a nitrogen atom into ti@xmath4o@xmath11 to form ti@xmath4n@xmath4o is smaller than that into tio@xmath4 .",
    "these results show that ti@xmath4n@xmath4o is a more promising material than nitrogen - doped tio@xmath4 .",
    "we hope that this approach would be extended to cases with lower nitrogen concentration and to other transition - metal oxynitrides .",

    "<S> we propose a systematic approach to obtain various forms of insulating titanium oxynitrides ti@xmath0n@xmath1o@xmath2 and we conduct a detailed study on its @xmath3 case , ti@xmath4n@xmath4o . </S>",
    "<S> we study the energetics and the electronic structures of ti@xmath4n@xmath4o and compare these results with those of pristine and nitrogen - doped tio@xmath4 within the framework of the density - functional theory ( dft ) and the gw approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we find that ti@xmath4n@xmath4o is semiconducting with the calculated band - gap of 1.81  ev , which is significantly smaller than those of pristine tio@xmath4 rutile ( 3.14  ev ) or anatase ( 3.55  ev ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the reduction of the band - gap of ti@xmath4n@xmath4o is realized not by lowering of the conduction - band minimum but by rising the valence - band maximum . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the proposed ti@xmath4n@xmath4o has suitable band - edge alignment for water - splitting photocatalysis . </S>",
    "<S> finally , total energy calculations indicate that ti@xmath4n@xmath4o is potentially easier to synthesize than nitrogen - doped tio@xmath4 . based on these results , </S>",
    "<S> we propose ti@xmath4n@xmath4o as a promising visible - light photocatalytic material . </S>"
