    "it has been known for some time that conventional perturbation theory is inadequate for describing high - temperature field theory @xcite , with the perturbation expansion breaking down at some order in the coupling constant in the parameter regime where the temperature is very much greater than the bare mass .",
    "there have been several attempts to circumvent this problem ( for example refs .",
    "@xcite use resummed perturbative expansions and systematically include all relevant diagrams ) .",
    "a temperature - dependent renormalization group approach has been used in ref .",
    "the method we will employ in this paper is the linear @xmath0 expansion ( see , for example @xcite ) , which contains elements of both of the above methods .",
    "it involves a mass shift which is determined order - by - order in the expansion by a non - perturbative criterion , but prior to the ( crucial ) optimization stage it merely uses low - order perturbation theory with modified propagators and vertices .",
    "pinto and ramos @xcite have successfully applied the method to finite - temperature symmetry breaking in a scalar field theory with a @xmath4 interaction up to second order in @xmath0 , which in particular involves evaluating the non - trivial  setting - sun \" diagram . in the present paper",
    "we extend this approach to tackle the problem of a non - zero chemical potential ; in so doing we consider a complex scalar field rather than a real scalar field . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the effect is simply to alter the symmetry factors of the one- and two - loop diagrams , but for @xmath6 there is a shift in the energy component of the matsubara propagator , which makes the diagrams considerably more difficult to evaluate but presents no problem of principle .    to our knowledge",

    "we outline the linear @xmath0 expansion technique below and explain how it can generate nonperturbative results , while in sec .",
    "ii we present briefly the construction of the theory in the imaginary time formalism and include the chemical potential associated with a conserved charge .",
    "we then go on to calculate all diagrams contributing to the self - energy , up to second order in @xmath0 .",

    "the appendix contains a detailed calculation of the two - loop setting sun diagram in the high temperature expansion .",
    "the linear @xmath0 expansion ( lde ) is a technique that allows the use of an analytic approach to probe the nonperturbative sector of the field theory to which it is applied .",
    "it has been employed with success in a wide variety of areas @xcite , with convergence of the expansion rigorously demonstrated in some simple zero- and one - dimensional models ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the method involves the introduction of an artificial expansion parameter , @xmath0 , and the modification of the action of the theory under consideration via @xmath9 where @xmath10 is some set of variational parameters and @xmath11 represents the action of some soluble theory .",
    "this trial action is not determined by the method ; however , an appropriate choice is usually suggested by the form of the theory under consideration . the @xmath0-modified action can then be used to evaluate some desired physical quantity as a power series in @xmath0 ( truncated at some finite order , @xmath7 ) , with @xmath0 then set equal to 1 at the end of the calculation .",
    "we label this quantity @xmath12 , noting that it will , in general , have a residual dependence on the @xmath10 .",
    "the variational element is introduced by fixing these parameters according to some specified criterion .",
