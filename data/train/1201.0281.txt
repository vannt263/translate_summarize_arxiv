    "<S> recent data on the nuclear modification factor @xmath0 of jet fragments in @xmath1  atev pb+pb collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) indicate that the jet - medium coupling in a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is reduced at lhc energies and not compatible with the coupling deduced from data at the relativistic hadron collider ( rhic ) . </S>",

    "<S> we use a simple analytic `` polytrope '' model ( @xmath7 ) to investigate the dynamical jet - energy loss model dependence . varying @xmath8 interpolates between weakly - coupled and strongly - coupled models of jet - energy dependence while @xmath9 covers a wide range of possible jet - path dependencies from elastic and radiative to holographic string mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> our fit to lhc data indicates an approximate 40% reduction of the coupling @xmath10 from rhic to lhc and excludes energy - loss models characterized by a jet - energy exponent with @xmath11 . in particular , the rapid rise of @xmath0 with @xmath12  gev combined with the slow variation of the asymptotic @xmath13 at the lhc rules out popular exponential geometric optics models ( @xmath14 ) . </S>",
