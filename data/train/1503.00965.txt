    "as @xmath193 is certified in @xmath37 by the path @xmath194 , we also have @xmath195 .",

    "let us establish the following technical result .",
    "[ claim : technical ] let @xmath37 be a nice coloring of @xmath1 and assume that there exists at least one arc from @xmath197 to @xmath106 in @xmath39 .",

    "as @xmath49 is an initial section of @xmath39 , every forward certifying path starting at a vertex of @xmath200 lies in @xmath201 .",
    "thus every vertex of @xmath202 has a ( forward ) certifying path in @xmath200 .",
    "we have @xmath203 since @xmath204 and @xmath205 .",
    "thus there exists a path on three vertices starting in @xmath206 , ending on @xmath130 and lying in @xmath200 .",
    "this path is a backward certifying path for @xmath130 . to conclude ,",
    "let @xmath207 be a vertex of @xmath208 .",
    "as @xmath209 , @xmath207 is certified in @xmath39 by a backward path @xmath210 on three vertices . by construction we have @xmath211 and then @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "note that , since there is an arc from @xmath197 to @xmath106 , we have @xmath214 for every vertex @xmath7 of @xmath197 and then @xmath215 for every vertex @xmath216 of @xmath217 . since @xmath218 ,",
    "if @xmath219 then @xmath220 must be in @xmath197 , which is impossible since @xmath220 is not a source .",
    "so @xmath220 is not contained in @xmath49 .",
    "moreover since @xmath221 and @xmath49 only contains vertices @xmath7 satisfying @xmath222 , we have @xmath223 .",
    "thus @xmath224 is a certifying backward path in @xmath225 .    from now on",
    ", we consider a nice coloring of @xmath1 with maximal height among all the nice colorings of @xmath1 .",
    "this choice implies that if we perform a switch coloring in @xmath37 , case * ( c ) * of claim  [ claim : switch ] can not occur .",
    "the next claim establishes some properties on the structure of the last levels of @xmath39 for such nice colorings of @xmath1 .",
    "[ claim : completebipartite ] let @xmath37 be a nice coloring of @xmath1 with maximal height .",

    "so we have @xmath230 .",
    "thus @xmath1 induces a complete bipartite graph on @xmath226 with bipartition @xmath227 .",
    "now let us prove that @xmath1 induces a complete bipartite graph on @xmath228 with bipartition @xmath229 . by contradiction",

    "both @xmath268 and @xmath269 induce complete bipartite graphs in @xmath1 , and then @xmath270 is an oriented path in @xmath66 .",
    "so , it is a backward certifying path for @xmath255 and a forward certifying path of @xmath271 .",
    "moreover , @xmath272 is also an oriented path of @xmath66 , and then a certifying backward path for @xmath207 .",
    "so every vertex of @xmath273 has a certifying path in @xmath66 . to conclude we notice that the oriented graph @xmath274 is unchanged by the recoloring .",
    "so we apply claim  [ claim : technical ] with @xmath275 and conclude that every vertex of @xmath276 has a certifying path in @xmath277 .",
    "+ in all , every vertex of @xmath1 has a certifying path in @xmath66 , a contradiction to the fact that @xmath1 is a counter - example to theorem  [ theo:3colorful ] .",
    "now , it is possible to conclude the proof of theorem  [ theo:3colorful ] by applying repeated switch colorings on vertices of @xmath106 .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath37 be a coloring of @xmath1 with maximal height . by claim  [ claim : onlylastlevel ] ,",
    "the in - neighbourhood of every vertex @xmath43 of @xmath106 is exactly @xmath197 , and its out - neighbourhood is @xmath278 .",
    "so , as @xmath1 has no twins by claim  [ claim : no - twin ] , it means that @xmath106 contains only one vertex which is linked to @xmath130 and to all the vertices of @xmath241 .",

    "now , if we apply a switch coloring on the unique vertex of @xmath106 and obtain a coloring @xmath51 , properties * ( b ) * and * ( d ) * of claim  [ claim : switch ] imply that @xmath283 for @xmath284 and @xmath285 . as @xmath51 is also a nice coloring of @xmath1 with maximal height",
    ", we also have that @xmath286 and that the neighbourhood of the unique vertex of @xmath287 is @xmath288 . by repeating switch colorings ,",
    "a direct induction shows that , for every @xmath162 , @xmath289 contains exactly one vertex , and the neighbourhood of this vertex is @xmath290 .",
    "so , the graph @xmath1 is a cycle , a contradiction to lemma  [ lem : cycleok ] .",
    "notice that we can derive a polynomial time algorithm from the proof of theorem  [ theo:3colorful ] .",
    "indeed , one can verify that all the proofs of the lemmas and the claims provide algorithms in order to improve @xmath291 at each step or find a coloring for which every vertex admits a colorful path .",

    "besides , it seems that the methods used in the proof of theorem  [ theo:3colorful ] can not be immediately generalized to graphs with higher chromatic number .",
    "we can nevertheless state the following weaker result for @xmath292-chromatic graphs .",
    "let @xmath37 be a @xmath292-coloring of a 4-chromatic graph @xmath1 .",
    "denote by @xmath293 a ( non necessarily induced ) cycle of length 4 of @xmath1 . recall that lemma  [ lem : reachable - set ] ensures that the conclusion holds if @xmath39 contains a circuit .",

    "first assume that only two colors of @xmath37 appear in @xmath294 .",
    "up to a permutation on colors , we can assume that @xmath296 are colored with @xmath31 and that @xmath297 are colored with @xmath32 .",
    "for a vertex @xmath7 of @xmath1 , we denote by @xmath298 the set of vertices of @xmath1 which are the beginning of an oriented path in @xmath39 with end @xmath7 . notice that @xmath298 is always an initial section of @xmath39 .",
    "consider the set @xmath299 .",
    "if it contains @xmath193 or @xmath300 , it means that @xmath39 has an oriented cycle .",

    "respectively receive colors 4 , 1 , 3 , 2 , and we have a coloring of @xmath1 with four different colors on @xmath294 .",
