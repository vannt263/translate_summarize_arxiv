    "all the experimental outcomes so far indicate that the standard model ( sm ) is the correct effective theory of elementary particles for energies below the tev scale .",
    "if the recently discovered higgs - like boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern is confirmed to be the sm higgs , it will complete the experimental verification of the particle spectrum of the sm @xcite .",
    "however , despite its spectacular success with the experiments , there remain some issues like the hierarchy problems , fermion family replication etc . that are not properly addressed in the sm .",
    "many theoretical attempts have been made to resolve these issues . beyond - the - sm",
    "( bsm ) alternatives like supersymmetry , extra dimensions and quark - lepton compositeness are some well - known examples .",
    "many of the bsm theories predict the existence of new particles with masses near the tev scale .",
    "two detectors of the lhc , namely atlas and cms , are presently looking for the signatures of some of these new particles .",
    "of the various bsm scenarios , the quark - lepton composite models assume that the sm particles may not be fundamental and just as the proton has constituent quarks , they are actually bound states of substructural constituents ( preons ) @xcite .",
    "these constituents are visible only beyond a certain energy scale known as the compositeness scale .",
    "a typical consequence of quark - lepton compositeness is the appearance of colored particles with nonzero lepton numbers ( leptogluons , leptoquarks ) and excited leptons etc .",
    "some composite models naturally predict the existence of leptogluons ( @xmath3 ) @xcite that are color octet fermions with nonzero lepton numbers .",
    "several studies on the collider searches of leptoquarks and excited fermions can be found in the literature @xcite but there are only a few similar studies on @xmath3 s .",
    "various signatures of color octet leptons at different colliders were investigated in some earlier papers @xcite .",
    "recently some important production processes of the @xmath3 have been analyzed for future colliders like the large hadron - electron collider ( lhec ) , the international linear collider ( ilc ) and the compact linear collider ( clic ) @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the limits on ( charged ) color octet leptons available in the literature .",
    "the lower mass limit of color octet charged leptons quoted in the latest particle data book @xcite is only 86 gev .",
    "this limit is from the 23-years - old tevatron data @xcite from the pair production channel .",
    "a mass limit of @xmath4 gev from the direct pair production via color interactions has been derived from @xmath5 collider data in @xcite .",
    "lower limits on the leptogluons masses were derived by the jade collaboration from the @xmath6-channel contribution to the total hadronic cross section , @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 is the compositeness scale ) and from direct production via one photon exchange , @xmath9 gev @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the compositeness scale @xmath10 tev was excluded at 95@xmath11 confidence level ( cl ) for @xmath12 gev and @xmath13 gev for @xmath14 gev .",
    "it is also mentioned in @xcite that the d0 cross section bounds on @xmath15 events exclude leptogluons with masses up to 200 gev and could naively place the constraint @xmath16 gev .    in this paper",
    "we study the lhc discovery potential for a generic color octet partner of a charged lepton , namely the color octet electron , @xmath0 .",
    "although , in this paper , we consider only color octet electrons , our results are applicable for the color octet partner of the muon , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath17 also .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec . [",
    "sec : lag ] we display the interaction lagrangian and decay width of @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lhcsig ] we discuss various @xmath0 production processes at the lhc . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lhcdis ] we discuss the lhc reach for @xmath0 s . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclu ] we summarize and offer our conclusions .",
    "assuming lepton flavor conservation we consider a general lagrangian for the color octet electrons including terms allowed by the gauge symmetries of the sm , = |e_8^a i^(_^ac + g_s f^abcg^b _ ) e_8^c - m_e_8|e_8^a e_8^a + _ int.[eq : lag ] for simplicity , we have ignored the terms with electroweak couplings .",
    "the interaction part @xmath18 contains all the higher dimensional operators . in this paper",
    "we consider only the following dimension five terms that contain the interaction between ordinary electrons and color octet ones @xcite , vertices ( form factors ) .",
    "moreover , the octet term can lead to an @xmath19 vertex which can affect the production cross section .",
    "we assume the unknown coefficients associated with these terms are negligible . ] _ int = g^a _ + h.c .. [eq : intlag ] here @xmath20 is the gluon field strength tensor , @xmath8 is the scale below which this effective theory is valid and @xmath21 are the chirality factors .",
    "since , electron chirality conservation implies @xmath22 , we set @xmath23 and @xmath24 in our analysis .    from the interaction lagrangian given in eq .",
    "[ eq : intlag ] we see that an @xmath0 can decay to a gluon and an electron ( two - body decay mode ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath25 or two gluons and an electron ( three - body decay mode ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath26 ( via the @xmath27 vertex ) .",
    "however , compared to the @xmath28 decay rate , the three - body decay rate is suppressed by an extra power of @xmath29 and phase space suppression . if one includes dimension six or higher dimensional terms in the lagrangian then , in general , @xmath0 can have other many - body decay modes like , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath30 via a four fermion @xmath31 vertex",
    ". however , these many - body decays will be much more suppressed than the two - body decay .",
    "hence , in this paper , we focus only on the dominant two - body decay mode . with @xmath23 and @xmath24 , the decay width of @xmath0",
    "can be written as , _",
    "e_8 = .[eq : width ]",
    "in this section we discuss various production mechanisms of @xmath0 s at the lhc and present the production cross sections for different channels . to obtain the cross sections ,",
    "we have first implemented the lagrangian of eq .",
    "[ eq : lag ] in feynrules version 1.6.0 @xcite to generate universal feynrules output ( ufo ) @xcite format model files suitable for madgraph5 @xcite that we have used to estimate the cross sections .",
    "we have used cteq6l1 parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) @xcite for all our numerical computations .    at a hadron collider like the lhc",
    ", resonant productions of @xmath0 s can occur via @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 initiated processes where @xmath35 can be either a light quark or a bottom quark .",
    "the gluon pdf dominates at the low @xmath36 region whereas the quark pdfs take over at the high @xmath36 region .",
    "thus , depending on @xmath37 , all of the @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 initiated processes can contribute significantly to the production of @xmath0 s at the lhc .    for the resonant production @xmath0 s at colliders , two separate channels",
    "are generally considered in the literature ",
    "one is the pair production @xcite and the other is the single production of @xmath0 @xcite . in general ,",
    "pair production of a colored particle is considered mostly model independent .",
    "this is because the universal strong coupling constant @xmath38 controls the dominant pair production processes unlike the single production processes where the cross section depends more on various model parameters like couplings and scales etc .",
    "however , as we shall see , for @xmath0 s , the @xmath6-channel electron exchange diagrams can contribute significantly to the pair production making it more model dependent .       +    at the lhc , pair production of @xmath0 s is @xmath32 or @xmath34 initiated  see fig .",
    "[ fig : e8e8fd ] where we have shown the parton level feynman diagrams for this channel . of these ,",
    "only the electron exchange diagram , shown in fig [ fig : e8e8fd]d , contains the @xmath8 dependent @xmath40 vertex . in fig .",
    "[ fig : paircs ] we show the @xmath41 cross section as a function of @xmath37 for two different choices of @xmath8 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 tev , at the 14 tev lhc . in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_dep ] we have plotted @xmath44 as a function of @xmath8 to show the dependence of the pair production cross section on @xmath8 for @xmath45 and 2 tev , where @xmath44 is a measure of the contribution of the electron exchange diagram and is defined as , ( ) = ( ) - ( ) .[eq : model_dep ]    as @xmath8 increases the contribution coming from the electron exchange diagrams decreases and for @xmath46 becomes negligible .",
    "so the pair production is model independent only for very large @xmath8 .    after being produced as pairs at the lhc",
    ", each @xmath0 decays into an electron ( or a positron ) and a gluon at the parton level , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath47 for large @xmath37 , these two jets and the lepton pair will have high @xmath48 . this feature can be used to isolate the @xmath0 pair production events from the sm backgrounds at the lhc .",
    "+    the two - body single production channel where an @xmath0 is produced in association with an electron can have either @xmath32 or @xmath34 initial states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e8efd ] .",
    "this channel is model dependent as each feynman diagram for the @xmath50 process contains a @xmath8 dependent vertex . in fig .",
    "[ fig : single2bcs ] we show the @xmath50 cross sections as a function of @xmath37 with @xmath51 and 5 tev and 10 tev at the 14 tev lhc .",
    "as the @xmath0 decays , this process gives rise to an @xmath52 final state at the parton level .",
    "the @xmath53 and the @xmath54 produced from the decay of the @xmath0 , have high @xmath2 .",
    "the other @xmath53 also possesses very high @xmath2 as it balances against the massive @xmath0 .      apart from the pair and the two - body single productions , we also consider single production of an @xmath0 in association with an electron and a jet .",
    "the @xmath56 process includes three different types of diagrams as follows :    1 .",
    "the diagrams where the @xmath57 pair is coming from another @xmath0 .",
    "though there are three particles in the final state , this type of diagram effectively corresponds to two - body pair production process .",
    "the two - body single production ( @xmath58 ) process with a jet radiated from the initial state ( isr ) or final state ( fsr ) or intermediate virtual particles can lead to an @xmath59 final state .",
    "3 .   a new set of diagrams that are different from the two types of diagrams mentioned above . these new channels can proceed through @xmath32 , @xmath34 and @xmath33 initial states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : e8ejfd ] .",
    "+    this new set of diagrams has not been considered so far in the literature .",
    "it is difficult to compute the total contribution of these diagrams in a straight forward manner with a leading order parton level matrix element calculation because of the presence of soft radiation jet emission diagrams . in order to get an estimation of the contribution of these new diagrams without getting into the complicacy of evaluating the soft jet emission diagrams , here , in this section , we present the cross section only for the @xmath33 initiated processes , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath60 since the first and the second types of diagrams can not be initiated by @xmath33 state . in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare ] we show the cross section of the @xmath60 process along with the @xmath61 and the @xmath58 processes .",
    "we find that the cross sections even for the @xmath33 initiated subset can be comparable to the @xmath62 processes for large @xmath37 despite the facts that these new diagrams have three - body final states and are suppressed by one extra power of the coupling ( either @xmath38 or @xmath63 ) compared to the two - body single and pair production processes .",
    "however , since there is one less @xmath0 compared to the pair production process , depending on the coupling the three - body phase space of the single production can be comparable or even larger to the two - body phase space of the pair production for large @xmath37 .    after the @xmath0 decay ,",
    "the three - body single production process is characterized by an @xmath15 final state like the pair production .",
    "however , unlike the pair production , here one of the jets can have a low transverse momentum .",
    "+    so far we have considered only resonant production of @xmath0 s . however , a t - channel exchange of the @xmath0 can convert a gluon pair to an electron - positron pair at the lhc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gg2eefd ] ) .",
    "similar indirect productions in the context of future linear colliders such as the ilc and clic have been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "indirect production is less significant because the amplitude is proportional to @xmath65 .",
    "moreover , at the lhc this is also color suppressed because of the color singlet nature of the final states . in fig . [",
    "fig : compare ] we also show the cross section of the indirect production process at the lhc .",
    "from fig . [ fig : compare ] we see that for small @xmath37 , the pair production cross section is larger than the other channels . as @xmath37 increases ,",
    "it decreases rapidly due to phase - space suppression and the single production channels ( both the two - body and the three - body ) take over the pair production ( the crossover point depends on @xmath8 ) .",
    "hence , if @xmath8 is not too high , the single production channels will have better reach than the pair production channel and so , to estimate the lhc discovery reach , we consider both the pair and the single production channels . however , while estimating for the single production channels we have to remember that because of the radiation jets , it will be difficult to separate the two - body and the three - body single productions at the lhc .",
    "so , in this paper , we consider a selection criterion that combines events from all the production processes at the lhc .      to design the selection criterion mentioned above we first note some of the characteristics of the final states of the resonant production processes ,    1 .",
    "process @xmath66 has two high @xmath2 electrons and two high @xmath2 jets in the final state .",
    "process @xmath67 has two high @xmath2 electrons and one high @xmath2 jet in the final state .",
    "process @xmath68 has two high @xmath2 electrons and at least one high @xmath2 jet in the final state .",
    "all these processes have one common feature that they have two high @xmath2 electrons and a high @xmath2 jet in the final state .",
    "hence if we demand that the signal events should have two high @xmath2 electrons and at least one high @xmath2 jet , we can capture events from all the above mentioned production processes . to estimate the number of signal events that pass the above selection criterion we combine the events from all the production channels mentioned in the previous section .",
    "however , as already pointed out , it is difficult to estimate the number of signal events with only a matrix element ( me ) level monte carlo computation due to the presence of soft radiation jets .",
    "hence we use the madgraph me generator to compute the hard part of the amplitude and pythia6 ( via the madgraph5-pythia6 interface ) for parton showering .",
    "we also match the matrix element partons with the parton showers to estimate the inclusive signal without double counting ( see the appendix [ matching ] for more details on the matched signal ) .      with the selection criterion",
    "mentioned above , the sm backgrounds are characterized by the presence of two opposite sign electrons and at least one jet in the final state . at the lhc , the main source of @xmath69 pairs ( with high @xmath2 ) is the @xmath70 decay .",
    "pairs that come from @xmath71 .",
    "however , as we shall demand very high @xmath2 for both the electrons , this background becomes negligible and wo nt affect our results too much .",
    "] hence we compute the inclusive @xmath70 production as the main background . here , too",
    ", we compute this by matching the matrix element partons of @xmath72 jets ( @xmath73 ) processes includes the processes where the jets are coming from a @xmath74 or a @xmath70 . ] with the parton showers using the shower-@xmath75 scheme @xcite . for the background",
    ", we also consider some potentially significant processes to produce @xmath69 pairs , & & pptt ( bw)(bw ) ( b e _ e ) ( b e _ e ) , + & & pp tw bww ( b e _ e ) ( e _ e ) , + & & pp ww ( e _ e ) ( e _ e ) .",
    "note that all these processes have missing energy because of the @xmath76 s in the final state . in table",
    "[ tab : smbg ] we show the relative contributions of these backgrounds generated with some basic kinematical cuts ( to be described shortly ) on the final states . as mentioned , we see in table [ tab : smbg ] that the inclusive @xmath70 contribution overwhelms the other background processes .",

    "[ fig : reach ] for @xmath82 tev and 10 tev at the 14 tev lhc . in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach ] we also plot the @xmath83 using only the pair production process . to estimate the pair production from the combined signal",
    "we apply a set of kinematical cuts almost identical to the discovery cuts except that now we demand that the two electrons and the two leading @xmath2 jets reconstruct to two @xmath0 s instead of one :    1 .   * pair production extraction cuts * 1 .",
    "all the _ basic _ cuts 2 .",

    "@xmath86 gev 4 .",
    "@xmath87 and @xmath88 with @xmath89 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach ] , @xmath83 goes as @xmath80 for both pair and combined productions , as in these cases the backgrounds become quite small compared to the signals . with",
    "the discovery cuts the reach goes up to 3.4 tev and 2.9 tev ( 4 tev and 3.3 tev ) with 100 fb@xmath1 ( 300 fb@xmath1 ) integrated luminosity for @xmath82 tev and 10 tev respectively at the 14 tev lhc .",
    "this also shows that for @xmath82 tev ( 10 tev ) with combined signal at 14 tev lhc with 300 fb@xmath1 integrated luminosity the reach goes up from the pair production by almost 1.2 tev ( 0.5 tev ) .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that this increase depends on @xmath8 .",
    "as the single production cross section goes like @xmath65 , if @xmath8 is smaller than 5 tev then the reach of the combined production will increase even more but for higher @xmath8 ( like @xmath90 tev as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach ] ) its @xmath83 plot will approach more towards the pair production plot .",
    "in this paper we have studied the phenomenology of @xmath0 s at the lhc and estimated the discovery potential of such particles at the lhc . we have explored various production channels of @xmath0 s at the lhc namely , the pair , the two - body single , the three - body single and the indirect production channels .",
    "the contribution of the three - body single production channel is comparable to that of the two - body single production channel . while the pair production cross section dominates the other channels for low @xmath37 , for high values of @xmath37 the single productions become significant .",
    "the 14 tev lhc with 100 fb@xmath1 ( 300 fb@xmath1 ) of integrated luminosity can probe @xmath0 s with masses up to 2.5 tev ( 2.8 tev ) with only pair production .",
    "we have demonstrated how this reach can be increased further by combining signal events from different production processes . however ,",
    "this increment is @xmath8 dependent as the single production cross section scales as @xmath65 . for @xmath82 tev ( 10 tev )",
    "the increment is about 0.9 tev ( 0.4 tev ) with 100 fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity at the 14 tev lhc and with 300 fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity it is about 1.2 tev ( 0.5 tev ) .",
    "we point out that our analysis can also be used to probe @xmath8 , the compositeness scale , for any fixed @xmath37 .",
    "this is possible because of the scaling of the single production cross section with @xmath8 .",
    "for example , for @xmath91 tev and @xmath92 tev we estimate the single production cross section as @xmath93 fb which we obtain from the events that pass the discovery cuts but not the pair production extraction cuts . by computing @xmath80 ( _ i.e. _ , the luminosity requirement to observe 10 signal events ) from this we can conclude that for @xmath91 tev the 14 tev lhc with 100 fb@xmath1 ( 300 fb@xmath1 ) of integrated luminosity can probe @xmath94 tev ( @xmath95 tev )",
    ". this can be useful as the present searches of leptoquarks at the lhc generally focus on their pair production which is mostly independent of @xmath8 .",
    "however , even with the single production of leptoquarks at the lhc it is difficult to probe the compositeness scale directly .",
    "this can be seen in an effective theory picture as , unlike leptogluon , the interaction lagrangian of leptoquarks with the sm particles is dominated by renormalizable dimension four operators .",
    "we note that the data from the current leptoquark searches at the lhc can be used to search for @xmath0 s also . the current data for leptoquarks @xcite already puts some constraints on the masses of the @xmath3 s .",
    "for example the data from the search for 1@xmath96 generation charged leptoquark in the pair production channel clearly rules out a color octet electron of mass less than 900 gev ( see fig .",
    "10 of @xcite ) , since the pair production cross section of color octet electrons is always larger than the pair production cross section of color triplet leptoquarks of the same mass due to color enhancement .",
