    "wave collapse occurs in a wide range of physical contexts , including optics , atomic and condensed - matter physics .",
    "generally , collapse occurs if an attractive nonlinearity exceeds a critical value .",
    "if it is triggered at time @xmath0 , at the collapse time @xmath1 the wave amplitude asymptotically diverges at some point in space .",
    "in practice , the amplitude divergence results in dissipation of wave energy ( or particle loss ) .    the unifying theoretical framework for understanding different collapse phenomena is provided by the nonlinear schrdinger equation , which has been extensively studied for various forms of nonlinearity  @xcite .",
    "this general formalism is applied to self - focusing of light  @xcite , collapse of langmuir waves  @xcite and bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite , and even surface water waves @xcite .    in this framework ,",
    "wave collapse is classified as either _ strong _ or _ weak _ ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] ) . in a strong collapse , a finite fraction of the wave collapses towards the singularity . on the other hand , in a weak collapse  @xcite the fraction of the wave that ( in absence of dissipation ) ultimately reaches the singularity vanishes .",
    "this has the counterintuitive practical implication that making the system _ more unstable _ , by quenching the nonlinearity further beyond the critical point , can result in _ less _ dissipation  @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", weak collapse has not been experimentally observed in any physical system .",
    "an atomic bec with @xmath2-wave two - body interactions is modelled by the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation , with a cubic nonlinearity proportional to the scattering length @xmath3 , which can be dynamically tuned via a feshbach resonance  @xcite .",
    "the bec is prone to collapse for any @xmath4 , but a kinetic - energy barrier makes it metastable up to a critical interaction strength  @xcite . if the bec becomes unstable and collapses , dissipation occurs through three - body recombination that results in particle loss .",
    "importantly , the three - dimensional gp equation is expected to provide an example of weak collapse .",
    "previous collapse experiments with atomic becs  @xcite ( see also   @xcite ) were performed in the traditional setting of a harmonic trap .",
    "the critical point  @xcite and collapse times  @xcite were in general agreement with theoretical expectations  @xcite , but no evidence of weak collapse was observed ; the atom loss was only seen to grow with @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "[ btp ]     in this article we study bec collapse in a new experimental setting , using a @xmath6k condensate  @xcite prepared in the uniform potential of an optical - box trap  @xcite ; for details of our setup see appendix a. the combination of large system size ( up to @xmath7 m ) and fine tuning of the scattering length ( with a resolution of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the bohr radius ) gives us a very large dynamic range : we observe metastable attractive becs with up to @xmath10 atoms , and collapse times that vary between @xmath11 and @xmath12  ms .",
    "we demonstrate the expected scaling of the critical scattering length @xmath13 with the bec atom number @xmath14 and the system size @xmath15 , and show that the collapse time can be expressed as a universal function of the dimensionless interaction strength @xmath16 .",
    "most importantly , we observe conclusive evidence for weak collapse , namely the counterintuitive decrease of the atom loss with increasing @xmath5 , and experimentally determine the scaling laws that govern the weak - collapse atom loss .",
    "in sections  [ sec : criticalpoint]-[sec : weakcollapse ] we address in turn : ( i ) the _ critical point _ for the collapse , ( ii ) the _ collapse dynamics _ in a system that is suddenly made unstable by an interaction quench , and ( iii ) the _ aftermath _ of the collapse , which reveals its weak nature .",
    "the starting point for our discussion is the gp equation for a homogeneous box potential , with a heuristically added three - body loss term  @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the atom mass , @xmath19 is the three - body loss coefficient , and the boundary condition is @xmath20 at the trap walls .",
    "we use a cylindrical box trap  @xcite of variable length @xmath15 and radius @xmath21 , and always set @xmath22 , so @xmath15 is the only lengthscale characterising the system size .",

    "consequently , three - body loss is negligible in our ( meta)stable condensates .",
    "however , if the bec collapses , significant loss occurs , providing the primary experimental signature of the collapse .    neglecting the atom loss in a metastable bec , based on eq .",
