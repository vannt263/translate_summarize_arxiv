    "massive multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems employing simple linear precoding and combining schemes offer significant performance gains in terms of bandwidth , power , and energy efficiency compared to conventional multiuser mimo systems as impairments such as fading , noise , and interference are averaged out for very large numbers of base station ( bs ) antennas @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in time - division duplex ( tdd ) systems , channel reciprocity can be exploited to estimate the downlink channels via uplink training so that the training overhead scales only linearly with the number of users and is independent of the number of bs antennas @xcite .",
    "however , if the pilot sequences employed in different cells are not orthogonal , so - called pilot contamination occurs and impairs the channel estimates , which ultimately limits the achievable performance of massive mimo systems @xcite .    since secrecy and privacy are critical concerns for the design of future communication systems @xcite , it is of interest to investigate how the large number of spatial degrees of freedom in massive mimo systems can be exploited for secrecy enhancement @xcite .",
    "if the eavesdropper ( eve ) remains passive to hide its existence , neither the transmitter ( alice ) nor the legitimate receiver ( bob ) will be able to learn eve s channel state information ( csi ) .",
    "in this situation , it is advantageous to inject artificial noise ( an ) at the transmitter to degrade eve s channel and to use linear precoding to avoid impairment to bob s channel as was shown in @xcite-@xcite and @xcite , @xcite for single user and single - cell multiuser systems , respectively .",
    "however , in multi - cell massive mimo systems , multi - cell interference and pilot contamination will hamper alice s ability to degrade eve s channel and to protect bob s channel .",
    "this problem was studied first in @xcite for simple matched - filter ( mf ) data precoding and null - space ( ns ) and random an precoding .",
    "however , it is well known that mf data precoding suffers from a large loss in the achievable information rate compared to other linear data precoders such as zero - forcing ( zf ) and regularized channel inversion ( rci ) precoders as the number of mobile terminals ( mts ) increases @xcite . since it is expected that this loss in information rate also translates into a loss in secrecy rate , studying the secrecy performance of zf and rci data precoders in massive mimo systems",
    "is of interest .",
    "furthermore , while ns an precoding was shown to achieve a better performance compared to random an precoding @xcite , it also entails a much higher complexity .",
    "similarly , the improved performance of zf and rci data precoding compared to mf data precoding comes at the expense of a higher complexity .",
    "hence , the design of novel data and an precoders which allow a flexible tradeoff between complexity and secrecy performance is desirable .",
    "related work on physical layer security in massive mimo systems includes @xcite where the authors use the channel between alice and bob as secrete key and show that the complexity required by eve to decode alice s message is at least of the same order as a worst - case lattice problem .",
    "physical layer security in a downlink multi - cell mimo system was considered in @xcite-@xcite . however , unlike our work , perfect knowledge of eve s channel was assumed , an injection was not considered , and pilot contamination was not taken into account . furthermore , zf and rci data precoding were analyzed in the large system limit in @xcite . however , neither pilot contamination nor an were taken into account and the secrecy rate was not analyzed . using a concept that was originally conceived for code division multiple access ( cdma ) uplink systems in @xcite and later extended to mimo systems in @xcite , reduced complexity",
    "linear data precoders that are based on matrix polynomials were investigated for use in massive mimo systems in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , @xcite-@xcite did not take into account the effect of an leakage for precoder design and did not study the secrecy performance .",
    "hence , the results presented in @xcite-@xcite are not directly applicable to the system studied in this paper .    in this paper",
    ", we consider secure downlink transmission in a multi - cell massive mimo system employing linear data and an precoding in the presence of a passive multi - antenna eavesdropper .",
    "we study the achievable ergodic secrecy rate of such systems for different linear precoding schemes taking into account the effects of uplink channel estimation , pilot contamination , multi - cell interference , and path - loss .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * we study the performance - complexity tradeoff of selfish and collaborative data and an precoders .",
    "selfish precoders require only the csi of the mts in the local cell but cause inter - cell interference and inter - cell an leakage .",
    "in contrast , collaborative precoders require the csi between the local bs and the mts in all cells , but reduce inter - cell interference and inter - cell an leakage",
    ". however , since the additional csi required for the collaborative precoders can be estimated directly by the local bs , the additional overhead and complexity incurred compared to selfish precoders is limited .",
    "* we derive novel closed - form expressions for the asymptotic ergodic secrecy rate which facilitate the performance comparison of different combinations of linear data precoders ( i.e. , mf , selfish and collaborative zf / rci ) and an precoders ( i.e. , random , selfish and collaborative ns ) , and provide significant insight for system design and optimization . * in order to avoid the computational complexity and potential stability issues in fixed point implementations entailed by the large - scale matrix inversions required for zf and rci data precoding and ns an precoding , we propose polynomial ( poly ) data and an precoders and optimize their coefficients . unlike @xcite and @xcite , which considered polynomial data precoders for massive mimo systems without an generation , we use free probability theory @xcite to obtain the poly coefficients .",
    "this allows us to express the poly coefficients as simple functions of the channel and system parameters .",
    "simulation results reveal that these precoders are able to closely approach the performance of selfish rci data and ns an precoders , respectively .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ] , we outline the considered system model and review some basic results from @xcite . in sections [ s3 ] and [ s4 ] , the considered linear data and an precoders are investigated , respectively . in section [ s5 ] , the ergodic secrecy rates of different linear precoders are compared analytically for a simple path - loss model . simulation and numerical results are presented in section [ s6 ] , and some conclusions are drawn in section [ s7 ] .",

    "although collaborative designs introduce more channel estimation overhead at the bs , they may not always outperform selfish designs because of the imperfection of the csi and the limited number of spatial degrees of freedom available for precoder design .      as is customary for massive mimo systems , we assume that the downlink and uplink channels are reciprocal and the csi is estimated in an uplink training phase @xcite-@xcite . to this end , all mts emit pilot sequences of length @xmath62 and with pilot symbol power @xmath63 .",

    "hence , the achievable secrecy rate of the @xmath16 mt in the @xmath25 cell is bounded by the difference of the capacities of the channel between the bs and the mt and the channel between the bs and the eavesdropper , see ( * ? ? ?",

    "this leads to an upper bound for the eavesdropper s capacity , and consequently , to a lower bound for the ergodic secrecy rate .",
