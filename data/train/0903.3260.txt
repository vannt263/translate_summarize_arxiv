    "majority of cosmic gamma - rays observed by egret onboard the compton gamma - ray observatory concentrate around the galactic plane , and they are known as galactic diffuse gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray point sources near the galactic plane are observed above this diffuse ` background ' gamma - rays , and the diffuse emission model based on high - energy particle interaction with interstellar matter / field is extremely important for the analysis of gamma - ray emitting objects in the universe .    the dominant component of galactic diffuse gamma - rays above 100 mev",
    "is well explained by decay gamma - rays from neutral pions generated in nuclear interaction of high - energy cosmic - rays and interstellar matter @xcite . in calculation of this process ,",
    "most authors have computed gamma - ray flux generated by neutral pion decay which is produced in high - energy proton interaction on proton target ( see kamae et al .",
    "@xcite for the most recent calculation ) .",
    "actually , there are heavy nuclei both in cosmic - rays and target matter .",
    "this fact is taken into account by introducing a _ nuclear enhancement factor _ , @xmath0 , to be multiplied to the result of gamma - ray yield assuming cosmic - ray protons on proton target only .",
    "previous estimates are as follows : @xmath1 by stecker @xcite , 1.5 by cavallo and gould @xcite , @xmath2 by stephens and badhwar @xcite , 1.45 by dermer @xcite , @xmath3 by mori @xcite , where @xmath4 stands for kinetic energy of cosmic - ray proton .",
    "mori @xcite used the low - energy value of 1.52 given by gaisser and shaefer @xcite derived for calculation of cosmic antiproton flux without a factor related only to propagation , and took the spectral difference of heavier nuclei into account .",
    "later , simon , molner and roesler @xcite calculated interstellar secondary antiproton flux with a monte carlo model , dtunuc , to study contributions to the antiproton flux from @xmath5-nucleus , nucleus-@xmath5 and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "they gave the energy dependence on the nuclear enhancement factor ( which they call ` nuclear scaling factor ' in their paper ) which differs significantly in low - energy region ( @xmath6gev ) from a constant value as given by gaisser and shaefer @xcite .",
    "the situation is similar to the case of galactic diffuse gamma - rays , and we need detailed calculation of nuclear effect taking account of energy dependence for the new era of gamma - ray astronomy with a launch of _ fermi _ ( formerly called _ glast _ ) gamma - ray space telescope in june 2008 @xcite .",
    "here we use a monte carlo model , dpmjet-3 @xcite , which is an updated version of dtunuc , to calculate a nuclear enhancement factor for the galactic diffuse gamma - ray flux.)+(interstellar matter ) interactions using the same monte carlo model @xcite , but their results are given as final spectra and the nuclear effect on the gamma - ray production was not explicitly discussed in their paper . ]",
    "we calculated gamma - ray yield from @xmath5-nucleus , nucleus-@xmath5 and nucleus - nucleus collisions using dpmjet-3 .",
    "it is a monte carlo model capable of simulating hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus , nucleus - nucleus , from a few gev up to the highest cosmic - ray energies , and has been successfully applied to the description of hadron production in high - energy collisions @xcite . to check our calculation with this model , `` multiplication factor '' , @xmath7 and @xmath8 for proton and helium target , respectively , given in gaisser and shaefer @xcite , was recalculated for @xmath9  gev where @xmath10 is a kinetic energy per nucleon .",
    "this is a relative yield of gamma - rays from nucleus-@xmath5 and nucleus - helium collisions compared with that from @xmath5-@xmath5 collisions , and is defined as @xmath11 and similarly for @xmath8 , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) are a production cross section and an average number of gamma - rays produced in nucleus-@xmath5 ( @xmath5-@xmath5 ) collision , respectively .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab : mf ] .",
    "for each entry , 20,000 collisions were generated .",
    "reasonable agreement is seen , and in fact , using the flux values at 10 gev / nucleon , nuclear enhancement factor can be calculated as @xmath16 and is close to 1.52 , the value given by gaisser and schaefer @xcite , assuming the interstellar matter abundance and cosmic - ray composition given by ref.@xcite ( with the fraction of helium in interstellar matter @xmath17 ) .",
    "thus the low - energy value of the nuclear enhancement factor changes little by use of modern nuclear interaction model .",
    ".multiplication factor at @xmath10=10  gev / nucleon .",
    "g&s is quoted from ref.@xcite . [",

    "nuclear enhancement factor used in models of the galactic diffuse gamma - rays from cosmic - ray and interstellar matter interaction has been calculated by use of a monte carlo simulator , dpmjet-3 . a new value of 1.82.0 , slightly increasing with kinetic energy of projectile cosmic rays in the range 61000  gev / nucleon , is about 20% larger than previous estimates .",
    "this factor could have a larger energy dependence below 5 gev / nucleon where dpmjet-3 is not applicable ( see simon et al .",
