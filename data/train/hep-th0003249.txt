    "the discovery that certain field theories admit concrete realizations as a string theory on a particular background has caused a great deal of excitement in recent years @xcite .",
    "however , attempts to apply these correspondences to study the details of these theories have only met with limited success so far .",
    "the problem stems from the fact that our understanding of both sides of the correspondence is limited . on the field theory side ,",
    "most of what we know comes from perturbation theory where we assume that the coupling is weak . on the string theory side ,",
    "most of what we know comes from the supergravity approximation where the curvature is small .",
    "there are no known situations where both approximations are simultaneously valid . at the present time",
    ", comparisons between the dual gauge / string theories have been restricted to either qualitative issues or quantities constrained by symmetry .",
    "any improvement in our understanding of field theories beyond perturbation theory or string theories beyond the supergravity approximation is , therefore , a welcome development .    previously @xcite we showed that supersymmetric discrete light cone quantization ( sdlcq ) of field theories @xcite can , in principle , be used to make a quantitative comparison with the supergravity approximation on the string theory side of the correspondence .",
    "we discussed this in two space - time dimensions where the sdlcq approach works particularly well ; however , it can in principle be extended to more dimensions .",
    "we will study the field theory / string theory correspondence motivated by considering the near - horizon decoupling limit of a d1-brane in type iib string theory @xcite .",
    "the gauge theory corresponding to this theory is the yang - mills theory in two dimensions with 16 supercharges .",
    "its sdlcq formulation was recently reported in @xcite , and recent work has put the use of sdlcq for this class of problems on a stronger footing @xcite .",
    "this is probably the simplest known example of a field theory / string theory correspondence involving a field theory in two dimensions with a concrete lagrangian formulation .",
    "a convenient quantity that can be computed on both sides of the correspondence is the correlation function of gauge invariant operators @xcite .",
    "we will focus on two - point functions of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "this turns out to be a very convenient quantity to compute for reasons that are discussed in @xcite .",
    "some aspects of this , as it pertains to a consideration of black hole entropy , were recently discussed in @xcite . in the dlcq literature , the spectrum of hadrons",
    "is often reported @xcite .",
    "this would be fine for theories in a confining phase .",
    "however , we expect the sym in two dimensions to flow to a non - trivial conformal fixed point in the infra - red . the spectrum of states will therefore form a continuum and will be cumbersome to handle . on the string theory side , entropy density and the quark anti - quark potential are frequently reported .",
    "the definition of entropy density requires that we place the field theory in a space - like box which is incommensurate with the light - like box of dlcq .",
    "similarly , a static quark anti - quark configuration does not fit very well inside a discretized light - cone geometry .",
    "a correlation function of point - like operators does not suffer from these problems .",
    "the correlation function of the stress - energy tensor on the string theory side , with use of the supergravity approximation , was presented in @xcite , and we will only quote the result here .",
    "the computation is essentially a generalization of @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion on the supergravity side was reported recently in @xcite . up to a numerical coefficient of order one , which we have suppressed",
    ", we found that @xmath3 this result passes the following important consistency test .",
    "the sym in 2 dimensions with 16 supercharges have conformal fixed points in both uv and ir with central charges of order @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "therefore , we expect the two point function of the stress - energy tensor to scale like @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the deep uv and ir , respectively . according to the analysis of @xcite",
    ", we expect to deviate from these conformal behaviors and cross over to a regime where the supergravity calculation can be trusted .",
    "the crossover occurs at @xmath8 and @xmath9 . at these points , the @xmath5 scaling of ( [ sg ] ) and the conformal result match in the sense of the correspondence principle @xcite",
    "the challenge then is to attempt to reproduce the scaling relation ( [ sg ] ) , fix the numerical coefficient , and determine the details of the crossover behavior using sdlcq . in order to actually evaluate the correlation functions",
    ", we must resort to numerical analysis .",
    "the technique of sdlcq is reviewed in @xcite , so we will be brief here .",
    "the basic idea of light - cone quantization is to parameterize space - time using light - cone coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 and to quantize the theory making @xmath10 play the role of time . in the discrete light cone approach",
    ", we require the momentum @xmath12 along the @xmath11 direction to take on discrete values in units of @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the conserved total momentum of the system and @xmath15 is an integer commonly referred to as the harmonic resolution @xcite .",
    "one can think of this discretization as a consequence of compactifying the @xmath11 coordinate on a circle with a period @xmath16 .",
    "the advantage of discretizing on the light cone is the fact that the dimension of the hilbert space becomes finite .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian is a finite dimensional matrix , and its dynamics can be solved explicitly . in sdlcq",
    "one makes the dlcq approximation to the supercharges , and these discrete representations satisfy the supersymmetry algebra .",
    "therefore sdlcq enjoys the improved renormalization properties of supersymmetric theories .",
    "of course , to recover the continuum result , we must send @xmath15 to infinity and as luck would have it , we find that sdlcq usually converges faster than the naive dlcq .",
    "of course , in the process the size of the matrices will grow , making the computation harder and harder .",
    "let us now return to the problem at hand .",
    "we would like to compute a general expression of the form @xmath17 .",
    "in dlcq , where we fix the total momentum in the @xmath11 direction , it is more natural to compute the fourier transform and express the transform in a spectral decomposed form @xmath18 the position - space form of the correlation function is recovered by fourier transforming with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "we can continue to euclidean space by taking @xmath20 to be real .",
    "the result for the correlator of the stress - energy tensor was presented in @xcite , and we only quote the results here : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a mass eigenvalue and @xmath23 is the modified bessel function of order 4 .",
    "in @xcite we found that the momentum operator @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 , \\qquad i , \\alpha = 1 \\ldots 8\\ , \\label{susycorr}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the physical adjoint scalars and fermions respectively , following the notation of @xcite . when discretized , these operators have the mode expansions @xmath28\\,,\\nonumber \\\\ u_{i , j}^\\alpha & = & { 1 \\over \\sqrt{4 l } } \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty } \\left [ b^\\alpha_{ij } ( n ) e^{-i \\pi",
    "n x^-/l } + b^{\\dagger\\alpha}_{ji}(-n )   e^{i \\pi n x^-/l } \\right]\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the matrix element @xmath29 is independent of @xmath30 and can be substituted directly to give an explicit expression for the two - point function .",
    "we see immediately that the correlator has the correct small-@xmath31 behavior , for in that limit , it asymptotes to @xmath32    on the other hand , the contribution to the correlator from strictly massless states is given by @xmath33 it is important that this @xmath34 behavior at large @xmath31 not be confused with the @xmath34 behavior that we seek at large @xmath31 .",
    "first of all , there is not supposed to be any massless physical bound state in this theory , and , secondly , it has the wrong @xmath5 dependence .",
    "relative to the @xmath34 behavior at small @xmath31 , the @xmath34 behavior at large @xmath31 that we expect is down by a factor of @xmath35 . since we are doing a large-@xmath5 calculation ,",
    "this behavior is suppressed .",
    "we can only hope to see the transition from the @xmath34 behavior at small @xmath31 to the region where the correlator behaves like @xmath36 .",
    "in order to calculate the correlation function we use the expression ( [ master ] ) .",
    "this means that after diagonalizing the hamiltonian @xmath37 one should evaluate the projection of each eigenfunction on the specific state @xmath38 .",
    "the fact that we are only interested in states which have nonzero value of such projection leads to significant simplifications .",
    "one can diagonalize any of the eight supercharges @xmath39 . in the continuum limit ,",
    "the result does not depend on the value of @xmath40 that one chooses , but in dlcq the situation is a little more subtle . as was shown in @xcite , while the spectrum of @xmath41 is the same for all @xmath40 , the wave functions depend on the choice of supercharge .",
    "this dependence is an artifact of dlcq and should disappear in the continuum limit .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the discussion of this issue . here",
    "we will just pick one supercharge ( for example , @xmath42 ) .",
    "since the state @xmath38 is a singlet under r  symmetry acting on the `` flavor '' index of @xmath39 , the correlator ( [ master ] ) does not depend on the choice of @xmath40 even at finite resolution .",
    "a significant simplification occurs at this stage .",
    "suppose there exists an operator @xmath43 commuting with both @xmath37 and @xmath44 and such that @xmath45",
    ". then the hamiltonian and @xmath43 can be diagonalized simultaneously . from now on we assume that the set of states @xmath46 is a result of such diagonalization . in this case , only states satisfying the condition @xmath47 contribute to the sum in ( [ master ] ) , and we only need to diagonalize @xmath37 in this sector .",
    "so if one finds a large enough set of appropriate operators @xmath43 , then the size of the problem can be significantly reduced . by looking at the structure of the state",
    "@xmath38 one can conclude , given arbitrary permutations @xmath48 and @xmath49 of the @xmath50 flavor indices , that any transformation of the form @xmath51}_{ij}(k ) , \\qquad f(i)=\\pm 1   \\nonumber   \\\\   b^\\alpha_{ij}(k)\\rightarrow g(\\alpha)b^{q[\\alpha]}_{ij}(k ) , \\qquad g(\\alpha)=\\pm 1   \\label{initsymm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] commutes with @xmath44 , and that the vacuum is an eigenstate of this transformation with eigenvalue @xmath52 .",
    "the requirement for @xmath53 to be invariant under @xmath43 imposes some restrictions on the permutations .",
    "in fact , we will require that @xmath42 be invariant under @xmath43 , in order to guarantee that @xmath37 is invariant .",
    "the form of the supercharge from @xcite is @xmath54b^{\\dagger}_{\\alpha}(k_3)a_{i}(k_1)a_{i}(k_2 ) + ... + ( \\beta_i \\beta_j^t - \\beta_j \\beta_i^t ) _ { \\alpha \\beta }    [ ... ]   b^{\\dagger}_{\\beta}(k_3)a_{i}(k_1)a_{j}(k_2 ) + ... \\label{qminus}\\ ] ] here the @xmath55 are @xmath56 real matrices satisfying @xmath57 .",
    "we use a special representation for these matrices given in @xcite .",
    "let us consider the expression for @xmath42 .",
    "the first part of the supercharge ( the one which does not include @xmath58 matrices ) is invariant under ( [ initsymm ] ) as long as @xmath59 and @xmath60=1 $ ] .",
    "we will consider only such transformations . in order to analyze the symmetries of the @xmath58 terms ,",
    "let us make the following observation .",
    "in the representation of @xmath58 matrices we have chosen , the expression @xmath61 may take only the values @xmath62 or zero .",
    "moreover , for any pair @xmath63 there is at most one value of @xmath40 corresponding to nonzero @xmath64 .",
    "this fact allows us to represent @xmath64 in a compact form . to do so",
    ", we introduce a new object @xmath65 defined by @xmath66 our choice of @xmath58 matrices then leads to the following expression for @xmath65 : @xmath67 we are looking for a subset of transformations ( [ initsymm ] ) that satisfy the conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60=1 $ ] and leave the matrix @xmath65 invariant .",
    "the latter property means that @xmath68p[j]}]=g(\\mu_{ij})f(i)f(j)\\mu_{ij}\\ , .",
    "\\label{symmfinalcond}\\ ] ] since the subset of transformations that we seek forms a subgroup @xmath69 of the permutation group @xmath70 , it is natural to look for the elements of @xmath69 that square to one . in the case of @xmath70",
    ", it is known that products of such elements generate the whole group , and , as we will show later , the same is true for @xmath69 .",
    "one can construct all @xmath71 symmetries satisfying ( [ symmfinalcond ] ) , but not all of them are independent . in particular if @xmath72 and @xmath73 are two such symmetries then @xmath74 is also a @xmath71 symmetry . by studying different possibilities we have found that there are @xmath75 independent @xmath71 symmetries in the group @xmath69 , and we have chosen them to be +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     before discussing our results we need to address the question of massless states .",
    "our sdlcq calculation of the spectrum of the ( 8,8 ) theory saw massless states @xcite , and we argued that they were not normalizable bound states .",
    "the argument in that paper was not completely correct but the conclusion remains true .",
    "we find that in these massless states the number of partons in all the contributions is either all even or all odd depending on whether the resolution is even or odd .    we have not , however , removed these unphysical states from the data sets but rather used them to obtain an estimate of the region in @xmath31 where the calculation breaks down .",
    "this region is where the unphysical massless states dominate the correlator sum .",
    "unfortunately , this is also the region where we expect the true large-@xmath31 behavior to dominate the correlator , if only the extra states were absent .",
    "the correlator is only sensitive to the two - particle content of the wave function , and we see in fig .",
    "1(b ) the characteristic behavior of the massless states at large @xmath31 only at even resolutions . in fig .  1(a ) for even resolution , the region where the correlator starts to behave like @xmath34 is clearly visible . in fig .",
    "1(b ) we see that for even resolution the effect of the massless state on the derivative is felt at smaller values of @xmath31 where the even resolution curves start to turn up .",
    "we use these smaller values to estimate the value of @xmath31 where the large-@xmath5 approximation breaks down .",
    "we see that the value increases as we increase the resolution , as expected .",
    "another estimate of where this approximation breaks down , that gives consistent values , is the set of points where the even and odd resolution derivative curves cross .",
    "we do not expect these curves to cross on general grounds , based on work in @xcite , where we considered a number of other theories .",
    "a proof of the maldacena conjecture would show up in fig .",
    "1(b ) as a set of derivative curves that approached and then touched the line at @xmath76 as we increased the resolution . convergence in the resolution , @xmath15 , would appear as a flattening of the derivative curves at @xmath76 for the highest values of @xmath15 .",
    "we see that the derivative curves are approaching @xmath76 as we increase the resolution and appear to be within @xmath77 before the approximation breaks down .",
    "there is however no indication of convergence yet ; therefore , we can not claim a numerical proof of the maldacena conjecture .",
    "in this article , we used the sdlcq prescription for computing the correlation function of the stress - energy tensor @xmath78 , which may be readily compared with predictions provided by a supergravity analysis following the conjecture of maldacena @xcite .",
    "such a comparison requires non - perturbative methods on the field theory side , and the sdlcq approach is the only numerical method suited to this task . at the present time the calculation gives results that are within @xmath0 of the predicted value ; however , higher resolution calculations are needed to prove convergence .",
    "the results we present here increase the number of states by a factor of 1000 relative to @xcite .",
    "there are currently available methods that we believe could give us another factor of 100 - 1000 ; however , we have noted in our analysis of our numerical results that most of the contributions to the matrix element come from a very small number of eigenfunctions .",
    "an analytical understanding of this phenomenon could greatly accelerate the calculation .",
    "finally , we note that , in principle , we could study the proper @xmath79 behavior at large @xmath31 by computing the @xmath35 corrections . in the past",
    "we have computed such corrections in some theories . however , in the present case such a computation seems to be a very large project indeed .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge a. hashimoto for several very useful conversations .",
    "the calculations of matrices were done with a c++ code written in part by f. antonuccio .",
    "this work was supported in part by the us department of energy .",
