    "the theory of complex dynamical systems , which has its origin in the important work of fatou and julia in the 1910s , has been investigated by many people and discussed in depth .",
    "in particular , since d. sullivan showed the famous `` no wandering domain theorem '' using teichmller theory in the 1980s , this subject has attracted many researchers from a wide area . for a general reference on complex dynamical systems ,",
    "see milnor s textbook @xcite or beardon s textbook @xcite .",
    "there are several areas in which we deal with generalized notions of classical iteration theory of rational functions .",
    "one of them is the theory of dynamics of rational semigroups ( semigroups generated by a family of holomorphic maps on the riemann sphere @xmath4 ) , and another one is the theory of random dynamics of holomorphic maps on the riemann sphere .    in this paper , we will discuss the dynamics of rational semigroups .",

    "a * polynomial semigroup * is a semigroup generated by a family of non - constant polynomial maps .",
    "research on the dynamics of rational semigroups was initiated by a. hinkkanen and g. j. martin ( @xcite ) , who were interested in the role of the dynamics of polynomial semigroups while studying various one - complex - dimensional moduli spaces for discrete groups , and by f. ren s group(@xcite ) , who studied such semigroups from the perspective of random dynamical systems . moreover , the research on rational semigroups is related to that on  iterated function systems \" in fractal geometry .",

    "see @xcite , and @xcite@xcite .",
    "the research on the dynamics of rational semigroups is also directly related to that on the random dynamics of holomorphic maps .",
    "the first study in this direction was by fornaess and sibony ( @xcite ) , and much research has followed .",
    "( see @xcite . )",
    "we remark that the complex dynamical systems can be used to describe some mathematical models .",
    "for example , the behavior of the population of a certain species can be described as the dynamical system of a polynomial @xmath5 such that @xmath6 preserves the unit interval and the postcritical set in the plane is bounded ( cf .",
    "it should also be remarked that according to the change of the natural environment , some species have several strategies to survive in the nature . from this point of view , it is very important to consider the random dynamics of such polynomials ( see also example  [ realpcbex ] ) . for the random dynamics of polynomials on the unit interval ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we shall give some definitions for the dynamics of rational semigroups :    let @xmath7 be a rational semigroup .",

    "for example , by proposition  [ constprop ] , there exists a @xmath58-generator postcritically bounded polynomial semigroup @xmath59 with disconnected julia set such that @xmath60 has a siegel disk .",
    "as we see in example  [ realpcbex ] and section  [ const ] , it is not difficult to construct many examples , it is not difficult to verify the hypothesis `` postcritically bounded '' , and the class of postcritically bounded polynomial semigroups is very wide .    throughout the paper , we will see many new phenomena in polynomial semigroups that do not occur in the usual dynamics of polynomials .",

    "in section  [ main ] , we present the main results of this paper .",
    "we give some tools in section  [ tools ] .",

    "there are many applications of the results of postcritically bounded polynomial semigroups in many directions . in the sequel @xcite , by using the results in this paper , we investigate the fiberwise ( sequencewise ) and random dynamics of polynomials and the julia sets .",
    "we present a sufficient condition for a fiberwise julia set to be of measure zero , a sufficient condition for a fiberwise julia set to be a jordan curve , a sufficient condition for a fiberwise julia set to be a quasicircle , and a sufficient condition for a fiberwise julia set to be a jordan curve which is not a quasicircle . moreover , using uniform fiberwise quasiconformal surgery on a fiber bundle , we show that for a @xmath61 , there exist families of uncountably many mutually disjoint quasicircles with uniform dilatation which are parameterized by the cantor set , densely inside @xmath62 in the sequel @xcite , we classify hyperbolic or semi - hyperbolic postcritically bounded compactly generated polynomial semigroups , in terms of the random complex dynamics .",
    "it is shown that in one of the classes , for almost every sequence @xmath63 , the julia set @xmath64 of @xmath63 is a jordan curve but not a quasicircle , the unbounded component of @xmath65 is a john domain , and the bounded component of @xmath66 is not a john domain .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , we find many examples with this phenomenon .",
    "note that this phenomenon does not hold in the usual iteration dynamics of a single polynomial map @xmath13 with @xmath67 in the sequel @xcite , we investigate the markov process on @xmath4 associated with the random dynamics of polynomials and we consider the probability @xmath68 of tending to @xmath69 starting with the initial value @xmath70 applying many results of this paper , it will be shown in @xcite that if the associated polynomial semigroup @xmath7 is postcritically bounded and the julia set is disconnected , then the function @xmath71 defined on @xmath4 has many interesting properties which are similar to those of the cantor function .",
    "in fact , under certain conditions , @xmath71 is continuous on @xmath72 and varies precisely on the julia set , of which hausdorff dimension is strictly less than two .",
    "( for example , if we consider the random dynamics generated by two polynomials @xmath73 where @xmath74 , then @xmath71 is continuous on @xmath4 and @xmath71 varies precisely on the julia set ( figure  [ fig : dcgraph ] ) of the semigroup generated by @xmath75 .",
    "see @xcite . ) such a kind of `` singular functions on the complex plane '' appear very naturally in random dynamics of polynomials , and the results of this paper ( for example , the results on the space of all connected components of a julia set ) are the keys to investigating that .",
    "( the above results have been announced in @xcite . )",
    "moreover , as illustrated before , it is very important for us to recall that the complex dynamics can be applied to describe some mathematical models .",
    "for example , the behavior of the population of a certain species can be described as the dynamical systems of a polynomial @xmath57 such that @xmath57 preserves the unit interval and the postcritical set in the plane is bounded .",
    "when one considers such a model , it is very natural to consider the random dynamics of polynomial with bounded postcritical set in the plane ( see example  [ realpcbex ] ) .    in the sequel @xcite , we give some further results on postcritically bounded polynomial semigroups , by using many results in this paper and @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the sequel @xcite , we define a new kind of cohomology theory , in order to investigate the action of finitely generated semigroups ( iterated function systems ) , and we apply it to the study of the dynamics of postcritically bounded finitely generated polynomial semigroups @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , by using this new cohomology theory , we can describe the space @xmath49 of connected components of julia sets of @xmath7 , we can give some estimates on the cardinality of @xmath49 , and we can give a sufficient condition for the cardinality of the space of connected components of the fatou set of @xmath7 to be infinity . in @xcite",
    ", we investigate the random complex dynamics and the dynamics of transition operator , by developing the theory of random complex dynamics and that of dynamics of rational semigroups , simultaneously .",
    "it is shown that regarding the random dynamics of complex polynomials , generically the chaos of the averaged system disappears due to the cooperation of the generators , even though each map itself in the system has a chaotic part .",
    "we call this phenomenon `` cooperation principle '' . moreover , we see that under certain conditions , in the limit state , complex analogues of singular functions ( continuous functions on @xmath4 which vary only on the julia set of associated rational semigroup @xmath7 ) naturally appear .",
