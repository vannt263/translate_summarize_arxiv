    "<S> the oscillators are coupled adjacently with coupling constants that are purely imaginary ; the coupling of the @xmath1th oscillator to the @xmath5st oscillator has the bilinear form @xmath6 ( @xmath7 real ) . </S>",
    "<S> the complex hamiltonians for these systems exhibit _ partial _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 symmetry ; that is , they are invariant under @xmath9 ( time reversal ) , @xmath10 ( @xmath1 odd ) , and @xmath11 ( @xmath1 even ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ they are also invariant under @xmath9 , @xmath11 ( @xmath1 odd ) , and @xmath12 ( @xmath1 even ) . ] for all @xmath0 the quantum energy levels of these systems are calculated exactly and it is shown that the ground - state energy is real . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath13 for all @xmath1 , the full spectrum consists of a real energy spectrum embedded in a complex one ; the eigenfunctions corresponding to real energy levels exhibit partial @xmath8 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the @xmath3 are allowed to vary away from unity , one can induce a phase transition at which _ all _ energies become real . </S>",
    "<S> for the special case @xmath14 , when the spectrum is real , the associated classical system has localized , almost - periodic orbits in phase space and the classical particle is confined in the complex - coordinate plane . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the spectrum of the quantum system is partially real , the corresponding classical system displays only open trajectories for which the classical particle spirals off to infinity . </S>",
