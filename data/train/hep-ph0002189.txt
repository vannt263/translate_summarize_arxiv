    "the @xmath0 decay into @xmath5 is an example of isospin violation .",
    "the @xmath0 has isospin @xmath6 , spin @xmath7 , and hence it does not couple to the @xmath5 system in the isospin limit , which implies the rule @xmath8 .",
    "the experimental situation on this decay is rather confusing .",
    "there are two older results whose central values are very different but their quoted errors are so big that both were still compatible : the first one from @xcite gives @xmath9 .",
    "the second one from @xcite provides @xmath10 . very recently",
    "two new , more precise , but conflicting results have been reported from the two experiments at the vepp-2 m in novosibirsk : the cmd-2 collaboration reports a value @xmath11 @xcite whereas the snd collaboration @xcite obtains @xmath12 .",
    "isospin violation has become a fashionable topic in chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath13 ) @xcite but the @xmath14 decay is however unreachable with plain @xmath13 , since it involves the propagation of the pair of pions around 1 gev , far away from the @xmath13 applicability range .",
    "nevertheless , new nonperturbative schemes imposing unitarity and still using the chiral lagrangians have emerged enlarging the convergence of the chiral expansion . in @xcite",
    "the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) is used in one channel and good results are obtained for the @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 regions , amongst others , in @xmath18 and @xmath19 scattering . in @xcite the method is generalized to include coupled channels and one is able to describe very well the meson - meson scattering and all the associated resonances up to about 1.2 gev .",
    "a more general approach is used in @xcite by means of the n / d method , in order to include the exchange of some preexisting resonances explicitly , which are then responsible for the values of the parameters of the fourth order chiral lagrangian .    here",
    "we shall follow the work @xcite since it provides the most complete study of the different meson - meson scattering channels , including the mesonic resonances and their properties up to 1.2 gev .",
    "in particular , this method yields a resonance in the @xmath20 channel , the @xmath21 resonance , related to the @xmath0 , and this allows us to obtain the strong contribution to the @xmath14 decay .",
    "we also consider electromagnetic contributions at tree level which turn out to be dominant and were already considered in @xcite .    in order to calculate the contribution of an intermediate photon to the @xmath14 decay ,",
    "let us consider the effective lagrangian for vector mesons presented in @xcite , which is written in terms of the su(3 ) pseudoscalar meson matrix @xmath22 and the antisymmetric vector tensor field @xmath23 defined in @xcite    @xmath24=\\frac{f_v}{2\\sqrt{2 } } \\langle v_{\\mu\\nu}f_+^{\\mu\\nu}\\rangle+ \\frac{i\\,g_v}{\\sqrt{2}}\\langle v_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu\\rangle , \\label{lag}\\ ] ]    where ",
    "@xmath25 \" indicates the su(3 ) trace . in order to introduce the physical states",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath26 , we assume ideal mixing between the @xmath27 and @xmath21 vector resonances and hence taking into account that the @xmath27 does not couple to pairs of mesons at the order of eq . ( 1 ) , the coupling of the @xmath0 is easily deduced from that of the @xmath21 by simply multiplying the results of the @xmath21 by the factor @xmath28 . with these ingredients and the standard @xmath29 coupling we can write the contribution of a feynman diagram with the @xmath0 going to a photon which then couples to a pair of pions , and which is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are , respectively",
    ", the momenta of positive and negative pions and @xmath33 is the pion electromagnetic form factor , which at the @xmath0 mass is given by @xmath34 .",
    "this can be compared with the coupling of the @xmath0 to @xmath35 , or @xmath36 , which can be obtained from the @xmath37 term in eq .",

    "( [ lphipipi ] ) gives a @xmath0 coupling to @xmath1 @xmath40 which provides the @xmath41 decay width with the tree level photon mechanism . with a value of @xmath42 mev from the @xmath43 decay @xcite and using the coupling of eq .",
    "( [ g8phikk ] ) one obtains a branching ratio to the total @xmath0 width of @xmath44 .    in order to evaluate the strong contribution to the process we consider the @xmath45 amplitude corrected from isospin violation effects due to quark mass differences .",
    "the method used is based on the chiral unitary approach to the meson - meson interaction followed in @xcite .",
    "the technique starts from the @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath13 lagrangian and uses the iam in coupled channels , generalizing the one channel version of the iam developed in @xcite .    within the coupled channel formalism ,",
    "the partial wave amplitude is given in the iam by the matrix equation @xmath48^{-1}\\,t_2 , \\label{iam}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are @xmath46 and @xmath47 @xmath13 partial waves , respectively . in principle",
    "@xmath50 would require a full one - loop calculation , but it was shown in @xcite that it can be very well approximated by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the tree level polynomial contribution coming from the @xmath53 chiral lagrangian and @xmath54 is a diagonal matrix for the loop function of the intermediate two meson propagators which are regularized in @xcite by means of a momentum cut - off .    in the present case , in which isospin is broken explicitly and @xmath7",
    ", we are dealing with three two - meson states : @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath5 , that we will call 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the amplitude is a @xmath57 matrix whose elements are denoted as @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath49 and @xmath52 amplitudes used in the present work and calculated in the isospin breaking case , are collected in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the fit of the phase shifts and inelasticities is carried out here in the isospin limit , as done in @xcite and there are several sets of @xmath59 coefficients which give rise to equally acceptable fits .",
    "we write in table [ tabla2 ] the values of the coefficients of the different sets of chiral parameters .",
    "the corresponding results for the phase shifts and inelasticities can be seen in @xcite where it is shown that the small differences in the results appear basically only in the @xmath60 and @xmath61 resonance regions , where data have also larger errors or are very scarce .    in order to evaluate the contribution to the @xmath62 coupling from the strongly interacting sector",
    "we evaluate the @xmath63 amplitude ( @xmath64 ) and the @xmath65 amplitude ( @xmath66 ) near the pole of the @xmath21 resonance which in our case appears around @xmath67 mev .",
    "close to the @xmath21 pole the amplitudes obtained numerically are then driven by the exchange of an @xmath21 .    by assuming a coupling of the type of eq .",
    "( [ lphikk ] ) for the @xmath21 to @xmath55 and @xmath5 , these two amplitudes , close to the @xmath21 pole , are given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the three - momentum of the @xmath70 particle in the cm frame .    by looking at the residues of the amplitudes @xmath64 , @xmath66 in the @xmath21 pole",
    "we can get the products @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , defining @xmath73 we obtain the ratio of the @xmath74 to @xmath74 by means of the ratio of @xmath75 to @xmath76 , and hence taking @xmath74 from eq .",
    "( [ lphikk ] ) , we get the value for @xmath77 .",

    "the dispersion of the results provides an estimate of the systematic theoretical uncertainties .    from table",
    "[ tabla2 ] , we obtain , after taking into account the strong contributions @xmath99 on the other hand , explicit calculations of the absorptive part of the @xmath100 intermediate channel @xcite give a contribution of about 1/4 of the kaon loops . in order to estimate the uncertainties from neglecting the photonic loops we take a conservative estimate and consider them of the same magnitude as the strong interaction correction , and , hence , add an extra @xmath101 uncertainty . adding in quadrature the errors from the different sources ,",
    "our final result is the band of values : @xmath102 which is compatible with the present pdg average within errors and lies just between the results of the two recent experiments , which are much more precise , but mutually incompatible .",
    "the @xmath0 meson can not decay into two pions or @xmath103 in the isospin limit .",
    "the decay into two neutral pions is more strictly forbidden by symmetry and the identity of the two pions . as a consequence",
    "the decay of the @xmath0 into @xmath2 and @xmath3 is forbidden at tree level .",
    "however , the @xmath0 decays into two kaons and the processes described can proceed via the loop diagrams depicted in fig .  1 where the intermediate states in the loops stand for @xmath104 .",

    "( 2 ) contribute to all the diagrams in the figure .",
    "however , the @xmath105 term of eq .",
    "( 2 ) only contributes to the diagrams containing the contact vertex @xmath106 , like diagrams ( a ) , ( e ) .",
    "the idea follows closely the work of @xcite but for the treatment of the final state interaction of the mesons one uses here the norperturbative chiral techniques . in this case for l=0 , which is the only partial wave needed",
    ", one can use the results of @xcite , where it is proved that the use of the bethe salpeter equation in connection with the lowest order chiral lagrangian and a suitable cut off in the loops gave a good description of the meson meson scalar sector .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it was proved that the meson meson amplitude in those diagrams factorized on shell .",
    "the loops of type ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) can be summed up using arguments of gauge invariance following the techniques of @xcite and lead to a finite amplitude . on the other hand , the terms involving @xmath105 and a remnant momentum dependent term from the @xmath37 lagrangian in eq .",
    "( 2 ) only appear in the contact vertex @xmath106 , and the diagrams of type ( b ) , ( c ) are now not present .",
    "hence , in this case the only loop function involved is the one of two mesons which is regularized as in @xcite for the problem of the meson meson scattering .",
    "the average over polarization of the @xmath0 for the modulus square of @xmath107 matrix is then easily written and for the case of @xmath2 decay one finds    @xmath108    for the @xmath109 case we have    @xmath110    where @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the loop functions mentioned above .    we have evaluated the invariant mass distribution for these decay channels and in fig .  2 we plot the distribution @xmath113 for @xmath114 which allows us to see the @xmath115 contribution since the @xmath116 is the important scalar resonance appearing in the @xmath117 amplitude @xcite .",
    "the results are obtained using @xmath37=55 mev and @xmath105=165 mev , which are suited to describe the @xmath104 and @xmath118 decay of the @xmath0 .",
    "the solid curve shows our prediction , with @xmath119 , the sign predicted by vector meson dominance , as we quoted above .",
    "the dashed curve is obtained considering @xmath120 .",
    "in addition we show also the results of the intermediate dot - dashed curve which correspond to taking for @xmath37 and @xmath105 the parameters of the @xmath16 decay , @xmath37=69 mev and @xmath105=154 mev .",
    "we compare our results with the recent ones of the novosibirsk experiment @xcite .",
    "we can see that the shape of the spectrum is relatively well reproduced considering statistical and systematic errors ( the latter ones not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the results considering @xmath120 are in complete disagreement with the data .",
    "the finite total branching ratio which we find for the @xmath114 decay is @xmath121 , which is slightly smaller than the result given in @xcite , @xmath122 , where the first error is statistical and the second one systematic .",
    "the result given in @xcite is @xmath123 , compatible with our prediction .",
    "should we use the values for @xmath105 and @xmath37 of the @xmath16 decay we would obtain @xmath44 . the branching ratio obtained for the case",
    "@xmath109 is @xmath124 .",
