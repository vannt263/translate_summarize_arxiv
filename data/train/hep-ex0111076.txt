    "vepp-5 forinjector is a large installation that includes : dc - gun , klystron gallery , power supply system , bunch compression system , thermo system , bpm and others @xcite .",
    "operation conditions is pulsed with repetition rate from 1 to 50 hz .",
    "the control system of vepp-5 injection complex has a standard three - level model@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ soft : struct ] ) .            the lowest level is composed mainly from camac electronics .",
    "second level is a set of camac crate controllers with supplementary low - level software .",
    "there are several types of intellectual crate controllers based on inmos t805 transputer , icl-1900 odrenok and motorola 5200 .",
    "the high level is the server which runs under linux ( redhat-7.1 ) .",
    "all client programs have access to the low level only via the server , which performs initial loading and initialization of the crate controllers and supplementary programs .      historically there have been several generations of control system software on vepp-5 .",
    "the very first programs were simple  they implemented both client interface and hardware access .",
    "this approach is still used in some tasks .",
    "however , we quickly switched to three - level architecture , as to much more suitable .",
    "first versions were tied to specific controllers  separate software for odrenok and t805 .",
    "they are still in use , but a unified version was developed which is able to serve various types of controllers simultaneously ( see fig.[soft:3levels ] ) .",
    "the design of the unified version was greatly influenced by design principles of x11 .",
    "the new version uses the same mechanisms ( which are dictated by the nature of controllers ) as previous versions , described in sections [ comm : odrenok ] and [ comm : t805 ] .",
    "server  @xmath0 hardware system . ]",
    "high - level programs use motif for client interface .",
    "a special library was designed , which builds control windows `` on the fly '' from a database description , thus significantly reducing application creation time & costs .",
    "( an example of such window can be found at the right of fig.[soft : screen ] . )",
    "odrenok is the most popular crate controller in binp .",
    "it has icl-1900 instruction set supplemented with commands for camac bus access and vector operations .",
    "new camac adapter was developed to have a possibility to connect camac with pc via ethernet .",
    "camac - ethernet adapter provides the speed of data exchange up to 400kb / sec  @xcite .",
    "it is sufficient for real - time network operation .",
    "the server workstation has two ethernet cards : one is for communication to institute network and another is for local odrenok net .",
    "odos software structure.,width=264 ]    odos ( odrenok operation system ) protocols use ethernet packets of non - standard type , therefore the server requires i / o facilities for these packets . it is implemented by kernel module which provides sending , receiving and waiting functions via standard socket interface ; the module is supplemented by client libraries and utilities ( fig .  [ odrenok ] ) .",
    "however , usage of home - made protocol have shown many inconveniences .",
    "so , this year udp support was added to odos , which enables to use standard unix communication interface and solves many other problems ( routing between networks , kernel upgrades , stability ) .",
    "crate controller based on inmos t805 transputer  @xcite has been developed in binp as high performance device for data asquistion system .",
    "this type of controllers is a suitable tool for wired bpm and pick - up electronic control .",
    "this is because t805 has a powerful floating point unit . in this case",
    "all calculations are performed on the 2nd level and ready data is sent into 1st level software .",
    "t805 software structure.,width=264 ]    transputer controllers have no os ( despite the fact that transputers are excellent for parallel tasks ) , so the following set programs had to be made ( see fig .  [ inmos ] ) .",
    "first , a dispatcher to perform communication between local transputer net and a set of block drivers .",
    "second , an event handler ( `` pint '' ) which enables drivers to read data when it is ready .",
    "finally , a set of drivers for individual camac blocks ( 1 driver process per block ) .",
    "odrenok crate controller is very old .",
    "production of t805-based controllers had ceased .",
    "so , we have to find another crate controller .",
    "this year we began using another one , based on motorola 5200 processor .",
    "100 mb ethernet is used for comminication to host computers .",
    "this controller runs uclinux  @xcite  a linux clone designed for processors without a memory management unit ( mmu ) . having linux in both workstations and crate controllers significantly eases the life . on the other hand , lack of mmu makes multitasking and multithreading too tricky .",
    "so , using arm , powerpc or an x86 clone in camac controller could be much better choice , but 5200 was chosen mainly because of abilities of binp electronic design department .",
    "currently the information about hardware structure and knowledge of how it is mapped to `` physics '' information is spread along the various parts of software  in the server config files , hardcoded into application programs , etc .",
    "this is extremely inconvenient and error - prone , so we switched a significant part of manpower to design a database , which will contain all this information ( a so - called `` static database '' ) .",
    "the database is based on postgresql , but for more flexibility all pieces of control software will acces it through the server .    in the last several years vepp-5 began to use other hardware in addition to camac . in this process we tried to employ as standard interfaces as possible .",
    "the ultimate goal is to replace all custom - made pc@xmath0hardware communication boards with standard ones , such as ethernet .    for slow controls of power supplies",
    "canbus devices are used .",
    "however , this decision is still half - camac - based  the canbus controller is itself a camac block .",
    "this was done because it was impossible to find pci canbus controllers with open specifications .",
    "the canbus hardware fits nicely into our software architecture , so we ll widen its use .",
    "some devices ( like tv cameras ) require very high bandwidth , which ca nt be obtained from camac .",
    "so , our lab designs tv camera with 100 mb ethernet interface . having negative experience with non - standard communication protocols",
    ", we decided to implement transport protocol over udp .",
    "since ethernet chipsets are very cheap , even not - so - demanding hardware is being implemented with ethernet as communication media .",
    "thus ethernet extends its presence as one of control system s low - level buses .",
    "but various types of hardware ( crate controllers , tv cameras , slow devices ) will be physically connected to separate buses .      4 a.v.aleksandrov et al .",
