    "the pairing mechanism of cuprate superconductors has been a challenging problem since their discovery . to this day , among different scenarios , two stand out .",
    "first one is the anderson s resonating valence bond scenario  @xcite , in which superconductivity is pictured as a mott liquid of pairs formed by the superexchange interaction  @xcite .",
    "this is a strong - coupling approach and can predict many features of the cuprate phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "another is the body of weak - coupling approaches , including phenomenological models  @xcite , fluctuation exchange  @xcite and random - phase approximation  @xcite , in which the pairing interaction , i.e. , the `` glue '' , is mediated by the low - energy spin fluctuations .",
    "recently , much effort has been devoted , both in experimental and in theoretical fronts , to find more compelling evidence for the spin - fluctuation - mediated pairing . on the experimental side ,",
    "neutron scattering data show a prominent peak in the structure factor at the antiferromagnetic wave vector , relevant to @xmath0-wave pairing  @xcite . using inelastic neutron scattering data to parametrize the effective spin - susceptibility glue interaction , dahm _ et .",
    "@xcite find an excellent agreement between the numerically calculated features of the spectral function and the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy data .",
    "moreover , van heumen _ et .  al . _",
    "@xcite find a correlation between the doping trends in the `` glue spectra '' , derived from optical conductivity data , and the superconducting critical temperature .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the dynamics of this type of pairing has been recently investigated by numerous authors .",
    "for instance , employing an extended hubbard model , markiewicz and bansil  @xcite argue that while magnetic pairing mechanism is valid in cuprates , both high and low energies are relevant to pairing .",
    "similar conclusion have been drawn using numerical calculations of the hubbard model which often involve the dynamical mean - field treatments of the smallest system relevant to @xmath0-wave pairing , the cluster of four sites  @xcite . however , using similar techniques , others argue that only the low - frequency part of the pairing is important  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the validity of the spin - susceptibility `` glue '' approximation ( ssga ) , expressed in a form similar to that of random phase approximation ,  @xcite @xmath1 by exploring the _ momentum _ dependence of pairing and comparing it to the results obtained from a dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite simulation . here , @xmath2 is the particle - particle irreducible vertex function and @xmath3 is the fully dressed spin - susceptibility .",
    "@xmath4 denotes both momentum and frequency and @xmath5 is an effective coulomb interaction . unlike most previous calculations ,",
    "we employ a relatively large cluster , the 16-site cluster , allowing for more pairing symmetries .",
    "note that in our ssga , @xmath3 is also obtained from the dca simulation .",
    "this emulates the use of experiment to parametrize the `` glue '' approximation  @xcite .",
    "we find that when a finite next - nearest - neighbor hopping , @xmath6 , appropriate to describe the hole - doped cuprates@xcite is considered , the ssga form of the interaction leads to @xmath7-wave pairing  @xcite , while for the same parameters the dca yields robust @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "we show that this is due to the predominant scattering with the antiferromagnetic wave vector , resulting from the momentum dependence of the spin susceptibility , and the strong suppression of the density of states ( dos ) at the antinodal points ( strong pseudogap )  @xcite .",
    "to re - establish the @xmath0-wave pairing symmetry and the agreement with the dca , the ssga can be improved by adding an additional term with @xmath0-wave functionality in the momentum space .",
    "however , we find that the strength of this additional term should be larger than that of the ssga .     and ssga [ ( b ) and ( d ) ] particle - particle pairing matrices versus temperature .",
    "vertex function of eq .",
    "( [ eq:``glue '' ] ) is used to form the ssga pairing matrix .",
    "top panels correspond to the hubbard model with only nearest - neighbor hopping ( @xmath8 ) . in lower panels , a finite next - nearest - neighbor hopping",
    "is also taken into account .",
    "the inset of ( b ) shows the effective coulomb interaction used in the ssga vertex , which is adjusted so that @xmath0-wave eigenvalue in ssga is the same as its dca counterpart.,width=316 ]",
    "we consider a two - dimensional hubbard hamiltonian @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hopping matrix , @xmath11 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for electrons on site @xmath12 with spin @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we show results for @xmath15 equal to the bandwidth which is believed to be a realistic value for modeling cuprates  @xcite and at filling , @xmath16 .",
    "calculations at different hole - dopings show that our conclusions are valid in the under - doped region ( @xmath17 ) , where the antiferromagnetic correlations are stronger , while at larger dopings , the results are inconclusive since calculations are limited by the sign problem .    the dca is a cluster mean - field theory that maps the original lattice model onto a periodic cluster of size @xmath18 embedded in a self - consistent host .",
    "correlations up to a range @xmath19 are treated explicitly using a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) solver , while those at longer length scales are described at the mean - field level .",
    "previous dca simulations have shown a robust @xmath0-wave superconductivity for the hubbard model with @xmath15 comparable to the bandwidth .",
    "the dca has also established pseudogap and antiferromagnetic phases for this model which are in good qualitative agreement with experimental phase diagram of cuprates  @xcite .    to study the pairing , we calculate the eigenfunctions of the paring matrix , @xmath20  @xcite , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is temperature , @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the particle - particle bubble in the pairing channel and @xmath2 can be either @xmath25 [ eq .  [ eq:``glue '' ] ] or calculated in the dca . for the latter ,",
    "we measure the two - particle green s function in the pairing channel ( @xmath26 ) in the qmc process .",
    "then , using the bethe - salpeter equation , @xmath2 is calculated by subtracting the inverse of @xmath26 from the inverse of the bare bubble in the same channel ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the eigenfunction @xmath28 represents the gap function and provides information about the symmetry and the frequency dependence of the pairing .",
    "the singularities in the two - particle green s function , @xmath29 , which signal pairing instability , take place when the eigenvalue , @xmath30 , goes to unity .",
    "therefore , one can explore the superconducting tendencies by studying the temperature dependence of the leading eigenvalues .     with @xmath31 and @xmath32 at four different @xmath33 points in the first brillouin zone ( 1bz ) for ( a ) @xmath34 and ( b ) @xmath35 versus temperature .",
    "at low temperatures , the leading pairing symmetries in ssga can be determined by the value of the product @xmath36 at each @xmath33 point .",
    "the one for @xmath37 corresponds to the @xmath0-wave symmetry and shows a significant decrease with @xmath6 at low temperatures.,width=316 ]",
    "unlike dca calculations which yield @xmath0-wave pairing , when a finite next nearest neighbor hopping , appropriate to describe hole - doped cuprates , is considered the ssga pairing vertex alone [ eq .  [ eq:``glue '' ] ] does not result in pairing with @xmath0-wave symmetry . in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] , we compare the leading eigenvalues of the ssga and dca pairing matrices for zero and finite @xmath6 . when @xmath34 , the low - temperature dca results have a @xmath0-wave leading eigenvalue , followed by @xmath38-wave and @xmath7-wave eigenvalues .",
    "similar results are found with the ssga pairing matrix , except that @xmath38-wave is not one of the leading eigenvalues .",
    "however , when @xmath35 , @xmath7-wave instead of @xmath0-wave becomes the dominant pairing symmetry for the ssga while @xmath0-wave is still the leading eigenvalue in the dca .",
    "thus , the ssga fails to capture the symmetry of the pairing obtained from the dca calculation .",
    "here , @xmath5 , which is shown for the two different values of @xmath6 in the inset of fig  [ fig : comparison ] ( b ) , is adjusted so that @xmath0-wave eigenvalue in ssga is the same as its dca counterpart .",
    "the momentum dependence of @xmath3 and the renormalization of particle - particle bubble due to finite @xmath6 are responsible for the disagreement between the symmetry of the leading eigenfunctions in the ssga and the dca . to better understand why the dominant pairing in the ssga is not @xmath0-wave",
    ", we employ the following approximation : @xmath39 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the spin - susceptibility is considerable only at the antiferromagnetic wave vector , @xmath40 and at small matsubara frequency . in this approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : bethe ] ) can be written as @xmath41 considering that @xmath42 is also true , one gets @xmath43 this suggests that the leading eigenvalue of the ssga pairing matrix corresponds to a momentum , @xmath33 , for which the quantity @xmath44 has its largest value .",
    "since the bubble @xmath45 falls rapidly with frequency , only the lowest matsubara frequencies are relevant for determining the leading eigenvalues . in the following",
    ", we will discuss the behavior of @xmath44 at @xmath46 .    .",
    "arrows show the four independent ( @xmath47 ) scatterings between @xmath33 and @xmath48 on this cluster .",
    "the one that connects ( @xmath49 ) to ( @xmath50 ) is associated with the @xmath0-wave symmetry . ]",
    "when @xmath34 , @xmath36 is the largest for @xmath37 and @xmath51 at low temperature , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi16b ] ( a ) .",
    "the former situation favors @xmath0-wave pairing whereas the latter favors @xmath7-wave pairing .",
    "the close values of @xmath36 at these momenta explains the competition between @xmath0-wave and @xmath7-wave symmetries in ssga .",
    "note that for a small @xmath52 cluster , the resolution in momentum space is poor ( e. g. @xmath51 is not represented in the brillouin zone ) and the scattering between the nodal points which favors @xmath7-wave pairing is suppressed .",
    "thus , a larger cluster with good momentum resolution is important in capturing symmetries other than @xmath0-wave in the pairing channel .",
    "the 16-site cluster provides four independent values for @xmath36 .",
    "this is illustrate in fig .",
    "[ fig:1bz ] where each arrow represents a @xmath31 scattering between @xmath33 and @xmath53 .",
    "a finite @xmath6 strongly suppresses @xmath36 at the antinodal points while it has a small effect at other @xmath54 points [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : chi16b ] ( b ) ] .",
    "therefore , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) , the @xmath0-wave eigenvalue will also be suppressed relative to the @xmath7-wave eigenvalue . consequently , the @xmath7-wave pairing will be dominant in the ssga , which explains the results discussed in fig  [ fig : comparison ] .",
    "the renormalization of the bare bubble at the antinodal points can be understood from the changes in the dos . at low temperatures , the low energy dos at @xmath55",
    "is strongly suppressed [ i.e. , the pseudogap is enhanced ] with @xmath6 for the hole - doped systems while this effect is negligible at other @xmath54 points  @xcite .",
    "this indicates that in the over - doped region , where pseudogap is less pronounced , ssga might be a good approximation .",
    "we find that the spin - susceptibility representation of the pairing interaction , which is appreciable only at @xmath56 , does not always yield @xmath0-wave as the leading pairing symmetry .",
    "this seems to be especially true when realistic parameters for cuprates such as next - nearest - neighbor hopping are considered .",
    "we show that despite the inherent correspondence between the @xmath31 wave vector , at which the ssga interaction is large , and the @xmath0-wave symmetry , other pairing symmetries which also associate with the @xmath57 wave vector can be dominant . on the other hand , the dca exhibits a robust @xmath0-wave pairing for the same physical parameters of the hubbard model .",
    "-wave pairing interaction for the ssga term ( first term ) and the @xmath58 term ( second term ) of eq .",
    "( [ eq : glue2 ] ) for zero and finite @xmath6 versus temperature .",
    "@xmath59 is the total @xmath0-wave projected interaction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : glue2 ] ) . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the contribution of the @xmath58 term to the @xmath0-wave interaction is insignificant while for @xmath35 , it becomes more important than the ssga term at low temperatures.,width=268 ]    to investigate the possibility of a missing term , we propose to add an extra term to @xmath25 which enhances the scattering between the antinodal points . such approximation for the interaction vertex can be written as : @xmath60 here , @xmath61 is the @xmath0-wave eigenfunction of the dca pairing matrix , and @xmath5 and @xmath58 are temperature - dependent fitting parameters which are adjusted to reproduce both the @xmath0-wave and the @xmath7-wave leading eigenvalues of the dca pairing matrix .",
    "it is worth mentioning that maier _ et .",
    "@xcite proposed a similar term , @xmath62 , to be added to the ssga form in which @xmath63 is the @xmath0-wave form factor and @xmath64 is an effective exchange interaction .",
    "however , their motivation for the necessity of this extra term is quite different from ours .",
    "since they did not consider a finite @xmath6 , the ssga gave a @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "so , this term was suggested only to restore the large frequency behavior of the pairing gap found in the dca .",
    "our focus , on the other hand , is to examine the relevance of an additional term based on a momentum space argument .",
    "note that because our calculations are done using qmc on the imaginary frequency axis , generally comments about the frequency dependence of the pairing interaction can not be made . however , if relevant , the additional term may be responsible for the instantaneous part of the interaction , as described in ref .  .",
    "we also find that using @xmath65 instead of @xmath66 in our approximation provides a better fit to the dca results while imposing the @xmath0-wave symmetry .    for a finite @xmath6 , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : glue2 ] ) ( @xmath58 term ) has a prominent role in capturing the correct leading symmetries in this new form of the interaction . in fig .",
    "[ fig : alphavd ] , we show the fractional values of @xmath58 and the @xmath0-wave component of the ssga term  @xcite , @xmath67 for the two values of @xmath6 .",
    "we define @xmath68 as the total @xmath0-wave projected interaction .",
    "when @xmath34 , the contribution of the @xmath58 term to the @xmath0-wave interaction is insignificant .",
    "however , when @xmath35 , this term has a dominant role in the @xmath0-wave pairing at low temperatures .",
    "so , although the additional term enhances @xmath0-wave pairing , its contribution overshadows the contribution of the main part of the interaction i.e. the term proportional to the spin - susceptibility .",
    "this suggests that the ssga may not be improved by simply adding terms that enhance @xmath0-wave scattering .",
    "we study the validity of the ssga representation of the pairing interaction in the hubbard model . by comparing the leading pairing symmetries of this interaction with the pairing symmetries produced by the dca , we find that this approximation alone does not capture the correct pairing symmetry in the under - doped and optimally - doped regions , particularly when a finite @xmath6 is considered .",
    "we do not dismiss the possibility that ssga can be valid in the over - doped region , where the pseudogap phenomenon is less relevant .",
    "we show that this form of the interaction , which is large only at the antiferromagnetic wave vector , requires an additional term with @xmath0-wave symmetry to yield @xmath0-wave pairing at low temperatures",
    ". however , in case of finite @xmath6 , the additional term dominates the interaction as the temperature is lowered .",
