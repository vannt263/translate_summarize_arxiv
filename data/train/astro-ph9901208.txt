    "in fact the clumpy structure of matter in the universe extends for over 15 orders of magnitude in linear size , from stars to the largest clusters of galaxies , and for about 18 orders of magnitude in mass ( ostriker @xcite ) . at scales from galaxies to clusters of galaxies and even superclusters , the universe exhibits self - similar , fractal behavior ( mandelbrot @xcite ; peebles @xcite ) . at the largest scales , those probed by cobe observations ( smoot @xcite ) , for example",
    ", the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology which is based on the hypotheses of homogeneity and isotropy , provides adequate description of many uncorrelated observations .",
    "isotropy is broken by the primordial fluctuations in the matter density which subsequently become amplified by the gravitational instabilities .    in this paper",
    "we explore the observed self - affinity and scaling in the density correlation function and tackle them with the renormalization group , a tool originating in quantum field theory ( gell - mann & low @xcite ) , then extended to condensed matter physics ( wilson & kogut @xcite ) , later on extended to problems in hydrodynamics ( forster , nelson and stephen @xcite ) and applied to surface growth ( kardar , parisi and zhang @xcite ) and in the last few years applied to gravitation and cosmology ( prez - mercader et al .",
    "@xcite ) .    our starting point will be the non - relativistic hydrodynamic equations governing the dynamical evolution of an ideal self - gravitating newtonian fluid in a frw background . through a series of steps involving physically justified approximations , these equations reduce to a single evolution equation for the cosmic fluid s velocity potential . at this point one",

    "we add a noise source which represents the influence of fluctuations and dissipative processes on the evolution of the fluid , arising from , but not limited to , viscosity , turbulence , explosions , late universe phase transitions , gravitational waves , etc .",
    "the resulting equation is recognized as a cosmological variant of the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation ( kardar et al .",
    "@xcite ) which is the simplest archetype of nonlinear structure evolution and has been studied extensively in recent years in the context of surface growth phenomena ( barabsi & stanley @xcite ) . while the essential steps involved in arriving at this kpz equation are reviewed in section [ hydro ] , we refer the reader to the concise details of its complete cosmological - hydrodynamical derivation in buchert et al . @xcite .",
    "the relevance of stochastic fluctuations in structure formation in the universe has been addressed in berera & fang @xcite , where the rle of the kpz equation was emphasized . for frw cosmologies with curved spatial sections ,",
    "this equation contains a time - dependent mass - term . in section [ adiabatic ]",
    "we discuss briefly the adiabatic approximation which allows one to treat this mass term as a constant during most of the expansion of the background cosmology .",
    "having thus reduced the essential hydrodynamics to a single dynamical stochastic equation , we turn to the results of a dynamical renormalization group analysis to calculate the precise form of the density - density correlation function using the kpz equation .",
    "to do so we proceed first by extracting the renormalization group equations governing the evolution of couplings appearing in the cosmological kpz equation with respect to changes in scale and integrating out the short distance degrees of freedom .",
    "as we are interested in the behavior of the system at ever larger scales , we will run the renormalization group ( rg ) equations into the large scale ( infrared ) limit , a process known as coarse - graining .",
    "the fixed points of these rg equations determine the long  time , long  distance behavior of the system and their subsequent analysis yields both the power law form of the correlation functions as well as their explicit exponents . in particular , the value of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function exponent @xmath0 is calculated , and its value understood in terms of spatio - temporal correlated noise .",
    "a summary of our results and discussion are presented in the closing section .",
    "structure formation in the universe in the range of a few mpc up to several hundred mpc can be modelled as the dynamical evolution of an ideal self - gravitating fluid and studied within the framework of general relativity .",
    "however , we will restrict our treatment to the case of newtonian gravity for a number of physically justifiable reasons .",
    "first and foremost , the length scales involved in large scale structure formation by matter after decoupling from radiation are smaller than the hubble radius ( of order @xmath1mpc at the present epoch ) , so that general relativistic effects are negligible .",
    "secondly , it is known observationally that matter flow velocities are much smaller than the speed of light and that this non - relativistic matter plays a dominant rle over radiation in the epoch of structure formation .",
    "thus , the evolution in space and time of large scale structure in the universe will be described adequately by the newtonian hydrodynamic equations for a fluid whose components are in gravitational interaction in an expanding background metric .",

    ", @xmath9 is the hubble parameter , @xmath10 is the scale factor for the underlying cosmological background and @xmath11 is the ( time  dependent ) average cosmological density .",
    "thus , the local density is @xmath12 and the dimensionless density contrast is @xmath13 .    in the linear regime and for dust",
    "( @xmath14 ) , the vorticity of the velocity field @xmath15 damps out rapidly by virtue of the background expansion , and therefore @xmath16 can be derived from a velocity potential @xmath17 , @xmath18 , in the long - time limit .",

    "that is , we assume that the non - linearities and pressure have not yet had enough time to destroy the alignment in the acceleration and velocity fields of the cosmic fluid .",
    "assuming also that the pressure is a function of the density , @xmath23 , one arrives at the following equation for the velocity potential ( buchert et al .",
    "@xcite )    @xmath24    where we have also added a stochastic source or noise @xmath25 ( see a few lines below for a discussion ) .",

    "the reason why we introduce them here explicitly ( instead of setting them equal to unity ) will become clear in section [ rgeqs ] .",

    "the @xmath27-term is simply the convective term from the original euler equation ( [ euler ] ) written in the new variables , while the @xmath28-term entails the competition between the damping of perturbations due to the expansion @xmath35 and the enhancement due to self - gravity @xmath36 .",
    "the zeldovich approximation ( [ zeldo ] ) together with the poisson equation yield an important relationship between the density contrast and @xmath37 , the laplacian of the velocity potential , namely    @xmath38    which shows that the density contrast tracks the divergence of the peculiar velocity . because of this identity",
    ", we are able to calculate density correlation functions in terms of ( derivatives of ) velocity potential correlations .",
    "this is why it is worthwhile investigating the scaling properties of the kpz equation in detail .",
    "the noise @xmath39 appearing in ( [ kpz ] ) represents the effects of random forces acting on the fluid particles , including the presence of dynamical friction , and also of degrees of freedom whose size is smaller than the _ coarse  graining length _ ( indeed , the very fact that we are using continuous fields to describe the dynamics of a system of discrete particles means that we are implicitly introducing a coarse  graining length , such that the details below this resolution length are not resolvable .",
    "( the relevance of this length - scale will become clear in section [ rgeqs ] . ) there exist a number of physical processes on various length and time scales that contribute to an effective stochastic source in the euler equation .",
    "indeed , any dissipative or frictional process leads to a stochastic force , by virtue of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "so , fluid viscosity and turbulence should be accountable to some degree by adding a noise term in the dynamical equations",
    ". early and late universe phase transitions , the formation of cosmic defects such as strings , domain walls , textures , are sources for a noisy fluctuating background , as are also the primordial gravitational waves and gravitational waves produced during supernovae explosions and collapse of binary systems . another way to visualize the noise is to imagine a flow of water in a river ; there are stones and boulders in the river - bed which obviously perturb the flow and have an impact on its nature",
    ". the noise can be thought of as a means for modelling the distribution of obstacles in the river bed . in cosmology",
    "the obstacles in the river - bed represent , e.g. , density fluctuations and the fluid is the matter flowing in this `` river '' .",
    "the noise is phenomenologically characterized by its average value and two  point correlation function as follows ,    @xmath40    @xmath41    with @xmath42 a given function of its arguments ( see below ) .",

    "dependent mass term ( [ mass ] ) is identically zero for flat frw backgrounds , but evolves with time in closed and open frw backgrounds , keeping a constant sign during the epoch of interest : @xmath52 in open backgrounds and @xmath53 when the background is closed .",
    "there are two time scales in our problem : an intrinsic time scale associated with the dynamical evolution prescribed by equation ( [ cosmokpz ] ) , which is determined by the values of the coefficients in it , and an extrinsic time scale associated with the background expansion , which is determined by the parameters defining the background cosmology .",
    "a numerical study of the function @xmath54 for the physically interesting range of parameters , reveals that its relative variation over these two time scales is small , which justifies an `` adiabatic '' approximation : we can assume @xmath54 to be a constant , rather than a function of time , when performing the renormalization group analysis in the next section .",
    "this assumption greatly simplifies the analysis , and the presence of a non - zero mass term in the kpz equation results in a much richer renormalization group trajectory flow and fixed point structure than that corresponding to the massless case , as we will see below .",
    "the starting point for the subsequent analysis is the kpz equation for the velocity potential , eq .",
    "( [ cosmokpz ] ) . because this is a nonlinear equation , and because there are fluctuations , as represented by the stochastic noise term , it is to be expected on general grounds that renormalization effects will modify the coefficients appearing in this equation . due to the existence of fluctuations , the coefficients in equation ( [ cosmokpz ] )",

    "the renormalization group is a standard tool developed for revealing in a systematic way , how couplings change with scale in any physical system under the action of ( coarse)-graining . moreover , it predicts that all correlation functions go as power laws when the system is near a fixed , or critical point , i.e. , they exhibit self  similar behavior .",
    "however , the value of the scaling exponent changes from one fixed point to another .",
    "_ in fact , the values for the couplings at some reference scale establish the fixed point to which the system will be attracted to or repelled from , because these reference values will belong to a specific  basin of attraction \" .",

    "their coordinates are listed in the table , together with their associated exponents @xmath67 and @xmath66 and ir eigenvalues and stability properties under coarse - graining .",
    "both , the positions of these points and values of their exponents , depend in general upon the values of the noise exponents @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which parametrize spatial and temporal correlations in the noise .",
    "the pair of fixed points labelled as @xmath159 always lie in the plane @xmath146 , ( i.e. , @xmath147 ) but their location within this plane varies with the noise exponents .",
    "moreover , any rg flow which starts off in this plane will always remain in this plane ( this plane acts as a separatrix ) .",
    "it is important to point out that there are values of the noise exponents @xmath160 which lead to _ complex _ values of the fixed point coordinates for @xmath157 .",
    "this is because these fixed points arise as solutions of a quadratic algebraic equation whose discriminant can become negative for values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 in certain domains in parameter space",
    ". we must rule out such values of the noise exponents because of physical reasons .",
    "for the allowed values of @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( i.e. , those that lead to real fixed points ) , we find that @xmath159 have exponents @xmath66 and @xmath67 that are complicated functions of these parameters , but we have checked that for all allowed values , either @xmath161 or @xmath162 .",
    "the ir eigenvalues and the nature of these fixed points depend on @xmath163 . for the choice shown ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , both @xmath157 are saddle points . in fact , we have confirmed that the pair @xmath157 will always be saddle points whenever @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "the reason for choosing these particular exponent intervals will become clear in section  [ scalingsection ] .",
    "the next pair of fixed points @xmath158 also have coordinates and exponents depending on the noise exponents . as in the case of @xmath157",
    ", there are values of @xmath160 ( same as for @xmath157 ) leading to complex couplings , which we rule out .",
    "the allowed values of the noise exponents lie roughly in the respective intervals @xmath168 $ ] and @xmath169 .",
    "the exponents for @xmath158 are given by the simple functions @xmath170 and @xmath171 , and the stability properties do not depend on the particular values of the noise exponents within the above mentioned intervals . for the choice @xmath164 and @xmath172",
    ", @xmath173 is ir attractive while @xmath174 is an unstable saddle point .",
    "we must nonetheless exclude @xmath174 from our consideration since it lies below the plane @xmath149 , i.e. , it corresponds to a renormalized kpz mass @xmath175 , which therefore exceeds the scale of the momentum cut - off imposed on our perturbative calculation .",
    "we can now begin to put together the results we have obtained in relation with the scaling properties _ predicted _ by the dynrg .",
    "using equations ( [ proportionality ] ) and ( [ functions ] ) we can write for the 2point correlation function of the density contrast in comoving coordinates that    @xmath176    we see that the scaling behavior of @xmath177 is determined once we know the scaling behavior for the equal time two  point correlation function of the density contrast for the velocity potential @xmath178 ,    @xmath179    > from eqns .",
    "( [ corscale ] ) and ( [ limf2 ] ) , we have    @xmath180 , we have    @xmath181    which on using equation ( [ xi ] ) above for equal times gives    @xmath182    for the correlation function , and    @xmath183    for its fourier transform , the power spectrum",
    ".    equations ( [ corrfunct ] ) and ( [ powerspec ] ) are now suitable for comparison with observations and initial density @xmath184 . while these parameters ( and others ) do not appear explicitly in our calculations , they are there implicitely in quantities such as @xmath185 , the scale factor , whose calculation can not be carried out without a deeper knowledge of the noise sources .",
    "nevertheless , the renormalization group gives one a way to calculate the power law scaling law and its exponent as a function of which particular basin of attraction the systems happens to start out in .",
    "this explains exactly what we mean when we claim that no fine tuning of parameters is required in order to account for the value for the scaling exponent inferred from the observations .",
    "irrespective of where the system starts out in a particular basin of attraction , in time it inevitably flows into that basin s fixed point : this is very much a kind of independence of initial conditions . ] , since they are written in comoving coordinates , and therefore correspond to quantities directly inferred from observations and provided we assume that light traces mass .",
    "otherwise we would need to correct for bias , a strategy we leave for a future publication . from ( [ corrfunct ] ) and the definition of the exponent @xmath25",
    ", we see that the exponent @xmath186 measured from large scale galaxy surveys , where @xmath187 , is calculable in term of the roughening exponent @xmath67 and is given by seems to be independent of the spatial dimensionality @xmath84 .",
    "but this is fallacious , since @xmath67 itself depends on @xmath84 as is seen from the rge s . ]",
    "@xmath188    using our fixed point analysis we have computed all the exponents @xmath67 and @xmath66 for all the fixed points ( fourth column in table 1 ) . the predicted values for @xmath186 are tabulated in the table as shown .",
    "thus , at each fixed point , we derive a power law for the density correlation function @xmath189 . in the case of white noise alone",
    ", we see that none of the three corresponding fixed points are capable of reproducing any of the inferred values of @xmath186 ( @xmath190 ) from observations .",
    "it is of interest to point out , however , that the point @xmath145 yields the exponent @xmath191 , which means that the correlation function is strictly constant at this point , i.e. , the matter distribution is perfectly homogeneous .",
    "however , @xmath145 is an ir unstable saddle point and a fine - tuning in the initial values of @xmath154 and @xmath92 would be required in order to have the system flow into it under coarse - graining .    for colored noise ,",
    "the rg behavior becomes significantly richer since we now must map out rg equation flow trajectories in a three dimensional space of couplings ( see fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) .",
    "a glance at the tabulated calculated values of the exponent @xmath186 shows that @xmath173 is the only fixed point capable of yielding values of @xmath186 within the currently accepted range of values inferred from observations , by choosing @xmath192 and any @xmath167 , since @xmath193 for @xmath158 .",
    "although @xmath186 is independent of @xmath79 , a non - zero value of @xmath79 in the above interval must be chosen in order that @xmath158 exist ( this pair of fixed points vanish identically when @xmath194 ) .",
    "it is also the _ only _ ir - stable fixed point in the three  dimensional coupling space spanned by the couplings ( @xmath92 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 ) .",
    "this implies the following behavior : any point initially in the basin of attraction of @xmath173 inevitably ends up at this fixed point as larger and larger scales are probed : _ no fine tuning is required_.",
    "in this paper we have presented an _ analytical _ calculation of the density - density correlation function for non - relativistic matter in a frw background cosmology .",
    "the calculation hinges on blending two essential theoretical frameworks as input .",
    "first , we take and then reduce the complete set of non - relativistic hydrodynamic equations ( euler , continuity and poisson ) for a self - gravitating fluid to a single _ stochastic _ equation for the peculiar - velocity potential @xmath17 . the noise term @xmath197 models in a phenomenological but powerful way different stochastic processes on various length and time scales .",
    "second , we apply the well - established techniques of the dynamical renormalization group to calculate the long  time , long  distance behavior of the correlation function of the velocity potential ( which relates directly , as we have seen , and under the conditions we have specified , to the density - density correlation ) as a function of the stochastic noise source in the cosmological kpz equation .    when we carry out a detailed rg fixed point analysis for our kpz equation , we find that simple white noise alone is not sufficient to account for the scaling exponent @xmath198 inferred from observations of the galaxy - galaxy correlation function",
    ". however , we can get close to this range for the observed exponent if the cosmic hydrodynamics is driven by correlated noise .",
    "in fact , we need only adjust the degree of spatial correlation of the noise to achieve this , since the calculated value of the exponent @xmath199 associated with @xmath173 is independent of the degree of temporal correlations , as encoded in @xmath79 . moreover , @xmath173 is the only fixed point with this property , and is simultaneously ir - attractive , both desirable properties from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "this last property is very important , since it means that the self  similar behavior of correlations is a _",
    "generic _ outcome of the dynamical evolution , rather than an atypical property that the system exhibits only under very special conditions .",
    "thus we have learned that colored noise seems to play an important rle in the statistics of large scale structure .",
    "why _ it is that a non - zero @xmath79 and a @xmath200 are the relevant noise exponents is a question one still has to ask . to answer it",
    ", one would in principle have to derive the noise source itself starting from the relevant physics responsible for generating the fluctuations . here",
    ", we content ourselves with the phenomenological approach . nevertheless ,",
    "at some future point , it may be possible to say more about the spectrum of noise fluctuations .",
    "it must be pointed out that the renormalization group allows us to compute only _ asymptotic _ correlations , i.e. , after sufficient time has elapsed so that the effect of noise completely washes out any traces of the initial conditions in the velocity field or initial density perturbations .",
    "hence , there will be a time ",
    "dependent _ maximum _ length scale , above which noise has not become dominant yet and correlations therefore remember the initial conditions , as well as a transition region between these two regimes .",
    "the length scale at which this transition occurs depends on noise intensity and on the amplitude of initial perturbations .",
    "therefore , a physical model of the origin of noise would enable us to predict this scale , but such a task is well beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "it is also interesting that the renormalization group allows us to compute the proportionality coefficient of the matter density correlations , i.e. , the quantity @xmath201 in @xmath202 , by means of the so - called _ improved _ perturbation expansion ( weinberg @xcite ) .",
    "this length scale @xmath201 marks the transition from inhomogeneity ( @xmath203 , @xmath204 ) to homogeneity ( @xmath205 , @xmath206 ) .",
    "but @xmath201 is also dependent on the noise intensity and other free parameters of our model , so that a prediction is impossible without a deeper knowledge of the noise sources . at this point",
    ", we should mention the recent debate about the observational value of @xmath201 : on the one hand there is the viewpoint that homogeneity has been reached well within the maximum scale reached by observations ( davis @xcite ) ( @xmath207 ) ; on the other hand there is an opposing viewpoint as expressed by labini et al .",
    "@xcite who argue that @xmath208 .",
    "either viewpoint can be easily incorporated into our model , by suitably choosing the noise intensity .",
    "but if the latter value of @xmath201 turns out to be correct , this would indicate within our model that the noise intensity is really large and therefore , that noise and stochastic processes played a much more important rle in the history of the universe than has been thought to date .",
