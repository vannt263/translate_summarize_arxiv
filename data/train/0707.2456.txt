    "most patterns observed in nature are created by instabilities that occur in an uncontrolled noisy environment : convection in the atmospheric layers and in the mantle are subject to inhomogeneous and fluctuating heat flux ; sand dunes are formed under winds with fluctuating directions and strengths .",
    "the fluctuations usually affect the control parameters driving the instabilities , such as the rayleigh number which is proportional to the imposed temperature gradient in natural convection .",
    "thus , these fluctuations act multiplicatively on the unstable modes . in the same spirit , the evolution of global quantities , averaged under small turbulent scales ,",
    "can be represented by a nonlinear equation with fluctuating global transport coefficients that reflect the small scales complexity .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that the temporal evolution of the total heat flux in rotating convection can be described by a non  linear equation with a multiplicative noise @xcite .",
    "the dynamo instability that describes the growth of the magnetic field of the stars and some planets because of the motion of conducting fluids in their cores , is usually analyzed in similar terms :  the magnetic field is expected to grow at large scale , forced by a turbulent flow . here again , the parameters controlling the growth rate of the field are fluctuating @xcite .    since the theoretical predictions of stratonovich @xcite , and the experimental works of kawaboto , kabashima and tsuchiya @xcite",
    ", it is well known that a multiplicative noise may modify an instability process .",
    "these early investigations motivated numerous studies on the effect of multiplicative noise on an instability threshold .",
    "it can be shown in many cases that the noise induces a drift for the instability threshold ( see for instance @xcite ) . besides , t. yamada _",
    "et al _ @xcite have shown that multiplicative noise can lead to a new type of intermittency , called _ on  off intermittency _ , in which quiet and laminar ( off ) phases randomly follow bursting ( on ) phases .",
    "this intermittency has been identified in experiments in various fields : electronics , electro - hydrodynamic convection in nematics , gas discharge plasmas and spin - wave instabilities @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical works considered only the effects of a delta  correlated gaussian white noise or an ornstein  uhlenbeck noise with an exponentially decaying correlation function ( see for instance the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "however , with these types of noises that have at most one characteristic time scale , it is difficult to identify which part of the power spectrum density ( psd ) of the random forcing really affects the dynamics . on the contrary ,",
    "the noise in natural environment and also in experimental situations is far from being a white random process .",
    "therefore , we believe that the influence of the noise psd on an on - off intermittent dynamics deserves to be investigated more precisely .    to motivate further reading of this article , we show in fig.[fig1 ] the temporal traces of an unstable variable subject to two different multiplicative noises .",
    "both noises have the same standard deviation but different power density spectra .",
    "more precisely , in fig.1a , the psd of the noise has a higher value at zero frequency than in fig.1b .",
    "it is clear that the intermittent regime is suppressed if the low frequencies of the noise are reduced _ even if _ the standard deviation of the noise is kept constant . to understand this fact",

    "we also study the relation between the low frequencies of the noise psd and the statistics of the duration of the laminar phases in the intermittent regime ( section @xmath2 ) . in section @xmath3 ,",

    "for a small departure from threshold , i.e. , @xmath27 , @xmath25 is dominated by a decreasing power law over a large range of @xmath8 and all moments of @xmath8 grow linearly with @xmath14 .",

    "is related to the on  off intermittent character of the variable @xmath8  : the occurrence of laminar phases are responsible for the divergence of the pdf at @xmath11 .      white noise , with all frequencies having the same weight , does not allow to discriminate which frequencies play a role in the occurrence of on - off intermittency . however , as it clearly appears in fig.[fig1 ] , two non - white noises with the same standard deviation but different spectral densities at zero frequency , lead to dynamics that are qualitatively different . indeed ,",

    "let us call @xmath178 the averaged value taken by @xmath179 during an on - phase .",
    "using the fact that the off - phases have a negligible contribution to @xmath180 , we can write approximatively for a large measurement time @xmath176 @xmath181 for large @xmath176 , @xmath182 is the product of the averaged duration of an on - phase with the averaged frequency of occurrence of an on - phase . using the aforementioned analogy with a biased random walk limited by a wall ,",
    "we conclude that the averaged duration of an on - phase is finite when the drift @xmath14 tends to zero . moreover , the averaged frequency of occurrence of an on - phase is proportional to @xmath14 and therefore @xmath182 is also proportional to @xmath14 .",

    "this fact can be understood using the analogy with the biased random walk limited by a wall : the typical trajectories restricted between the onset of the on - phase and the wall do not depend on @xmath14 for vanishing @xmath14 .",
    "to summarize , when @xmath14 is very small , the system enters on - phases with a frequency linear with @xmath14 .",

    "we have studied different bifurcating systems subject to multiplicative noise . for a system of first order in time and for a small value of the product of the noise amplitude with its correlation time",
    ", an expansion showed that on - off intermittency occurs if the noise spectrum at zero frequency is greater than twice the departure from onset .",
    "this prediction is in agreement with numerical simulations that use colored random processes or chaotic fluctuations as noises . in the same limit",
    "we have shown that the statistics of the durations of the laminar phases are also controlled by the departure from onset and the noise spectrum at zero frequency .",
    "even at finite amplitude of the noise , we have verified numerically that intermittency disappears when the low frequencies of the noise are filtered out .",
    "this result is also derived analytically for a gaussian white noise and for another particular kind of noise , the dichotomous markovian process . for a system of second order in time",
    ", we have numerically studied the behavior of the unstable variable and showed that for small noise amplitudes , the pdf of the energy scales as a power law with exponent controlled by the noise spectrum at zero frequency and the departure from the onset . here again , by lowering the noise spectrum at zero frequency , the on - off intermittency is reduced and can be suppressed .",
    "finally , we have given some physical explanations for the effect of the noise spectrum at zero frequency on on - off intermittency and for the behavior of all the moments of an on - off intermittent variable that are linear with the departure from onset .",
