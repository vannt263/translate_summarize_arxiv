    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) is an important component in galaxies , not only in terms of mass , but also because it carries information on past generations of stars , and provides the main fuel for the new generations of stars . in the local universe",
    "the cold ism ( @xmath21 k ) is @xmath2215 - 40% of the total mass in stars ( fukugita et al .",
    "1998 ; zwaan et al .",
    "2003 ) , and at higher redshifts it is a major constituent of the universe ( @xmath23 times higher than in the local universe at @xmath24 ; storrie  lombardi & wolfe 2000 ; peroux et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the cold ism , heavy elements  the footprint of the stellar activity  can most easily be investigated through the analysis of uv absorption lines .",
    "apart from very detailed analysis in galactic ism ( savage & sembach 1996 ) , in the local universe exploring the uv absorption lines become possible only for a few bright star - forming galaxies ( heckman et al .  2001 ;",
    "aloisi et al .",
    "2003 ) due to limited capabilities of uv satellites . at higher redshifts , bright qso sources , whose sight lines cross intervening galaxies , allow the detection of absorption lines with uv satellites and ( at @xmath25 ) ground - based telescopes .",
    "qso damped lyman@xmath9 systems ( qso  dlas ) have probed the ism in more than 100 galaxies at @xmath26 ( prochaska et al .",
    "these data may be biased , however , to galaxies or regions of galaxies that are dust- and metal - poor since dusty , metal rich systems are likely to obscure or , at least , extinct the background qso .",
    "indeed , we have indications that the ism in other high redshift objects is chemically more evolved .",
    "for instance , gamma  ray burst ( grb ) afterglows are associated with regions of intense star formation ( bloom , kulkarni , & djorgovski 2002 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "they are  for a short time  much brighter than qsos ( @xmath27 times brighter in x  ray fluxes ) and can be detected even if embedded in a very dense medium . the analysis of uv absorption lines in 4 grb spectra ( grb  dlas ) shows high column density of metals in the ism of the host galaxies ( savaglio , fall , & fiore 2003 ; vreeswijk et al .",
    "in addition , large surveys of @xmath25 lyman  break galaxies ( lbgs , steidel et al .",
    "2003 ) show predominantly high equivalent widths ( ews ) of ism metal absorption lines ( pettini et al .",
    "2002 ; shapley et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the direct study of cold ism in galaxies requires reasonable s / n of the rest ",
    "frame uv continuum , and this is generally not sufficiently strong for our observational capabilities , even when redshifted to the optical at high @xmath28 .",
    "additionally , systematic problems arise from imperfect sky subtraction and ccd fringe removal . as a consequence ,",
    "surveys have mainly targeted @xmath25 galaxies where the lyman ",
    "break technique starts to be effective , or strong emission line objects , observable in the optical up to @xmath29 .",
    "the @xmath30 range is often referred to as the `` redshift desert '' for lack of discoveries .",
    "this interval is also very problematic for studies of galaxy evolution , since it apparently spans a major epoch of galaxy building : 50  75% of the stellar mass in galaxies was in place by @xmath29 , whereas at @xmath31 the lyman break galaxies contain only @xmath32% of the present day stellar mass ( dickinson et al .  2003 ;",
    "fontana et al .",
    "recently , the @xmath33 survey ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002a ) with 82 spectroscopically confirmed @xmath34 galaxies at @xmath35 have started to unveil some aspects of galaxy evolution in the redshift desert ( cimatti et al .",
    "2002b ; pozzetti et al .",
    "however , the number of galaxies drops to 17 if the @xmath36 interval is considered .    to improve optical spectroscopy , a new observing mode",
    "known as nod & shuffle ( n&s ) , has been recently developed ( glazebrook & bland - hawthorn 2001 ; cuillandre et al .",
    "1994 ) . during n&s observations",
    ", the telescope is rapidly switched between object and sky positions ( `` nodding '' ) , while the charge is `` shuffled '' between different parts of the ccd .",
    "because both the sky and objects are observed through the same optical path , slits , and pixels , the effects of fringing are eliminated and the sky subtraction greatly improved . as a result , n&s allows very long integration times before systematic effects start to dominate , @xmath37 times longer than is practical with conventional spectroscopy .",
    "we have begun a project to observe galaxies in the redshift desert ( the gemini deep deep survey , gdds , abraham et al .  in preparation ) that uses the n&s technique on the multi ",
    "object spectrograph at the gemini 8 m telescope .",
    "the @xmath38 seconds exposures allow us to reach very faint magnitudes ( limiting magnitude @xmath39 and @xmath40 , more than half a magnitude deeper than @xmath33 ) .",
    "both raw and fully reduced data from the gdds will be publicly available . in this paper",

    "ews of ism lines are reported , but column densities are not derived because lines are heavily saturated .",
    "they also subdivided the sample into 4 subsamples according to the ly@xmath9 equivalent width , in order to find possible correlation with observed parameters . here",
    "we only consider the ews of the total composite .",
    "although the few ism lines are saturated ( @xmath47  ) , inspecting them with the cog can provide interesting , even if qualitative , results on the heavy element enrichment in the neutral ism .",
    "we assume that the covering factor of the ism in front of the uv sources is one .",

    ", we get @xmath56  @xmath57 , from which we expect @xmath58 ( @xmath59   ( table 2 ) .",
    "a comparison between the gdds composite and the lbg composite can be made by considering the @xmath48 line .",
    "given the good accuracy of our column density measurement , we can estimate the expected ew for the @xmath48 line ( that is not covered by our data ) , and get @xmath60   ( table 2 ) .",

    "( 2003 ) in the lbg composite ( @xmath61  ) , but it is similar to that of the lbg subset ( 1/3 of the galaxies ) that does not display ly@xmath9 emission ( @xmath62  ) .",
    "various methods have been traditionally used to derive metallicities in high redshift galaxies using both absorption and emission lines . the lick indices method",
    "( faber et al . 1985 ) , recently applied on sdss @xmath63 galaxies ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2003 ) , compares absorption line strengths in stars with models ( vazdekis 1999 ) and is mostly sensitive to old stellar population systems . as eisenstein et al .",
    "( 2003 ) point out , the models are limited in the range of metallicities and can suffer from the age  metallicity degeneracy .",
    "nebular emission in the ionized ism is , on the other hand , more appropriate when dealing with star  forming galaxies .",
    "the metallicity , measured using [ ] @xmath64 , [ ] @xmath65 , and balmer emission lines of 56 galaxies at @xmath66 , ranges from half to two times solar ( kobulnicky et al . 2003 ) . in a similar study",
    "( 66 galaxies at @xmath67 ) lilly , carollo & stockman ( 2003 ) find that most galaxies in their sample have @xmath68 .",
    "this method relies on a good calibration of metallicity vs. line strengths derived from samples in the local universe , and requires also a reliable estimate of the stellar balmer absorption line contamination . as kobulnicky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) mention , it is useful in a statistical sense when using large data sets .",
    "moreover , this method requires ir spectroscopy for galaxies at @xmath69 .    in our first analysis of gdds data",
    ", we used uv absorption lines associated with the neutral ism to evaluate heavy element enrichment in a subset of galaxies in @xmath2 .",
    "this sample represents a joint set of the most massive galaxies at @xmath4 ( from the deep @xmath70 selection ) together with those with the strongest rest  frame uv emission ( from the @xmath71 selection ) .",
    "thus we are selecting massive starburst galaxies ; preliminary stellar mass estimates ( glazebrook et al .  in preparation )",
    "indicate that they have masses @xmath72 m@xmath6 and their descendants must correspond to galaxies of at least this mass today .",
    "this selection is quite similar to that of lilly et al .",
    "( 2003 ) at @xmath73 whose primary @xmath74-band selection pulls out massive galaxies and whose emission line cut pulls out a high  sfr subset .",
    "[ f3 ]    [ f4 ]      one of the advantages of using ism absorption lines associated with singly ionized elements in galaxies is that no model  dependent assumptions or calibrations , dust extinction or ionization corrections are important when deriving the heavy element enrichment .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the column density measured in the ism of different galaxies , as a function of redshift . in our analysis we unambiguously find that the metal enrichment of the gdds galaxies is high , with @xmath8 .",
    "eighteen qso  dlas have measured column density in the same redshift range ( @xmath2 ) . in this sample",
    "the highest column density of is @xmath11  @xmath75 , i.e. @xmath76 times lower than in the gdds composite .",
    "if we extend the range to @xmath77 , we find 24 qso  dlas , and 2 systems with comparable column density ( 8% of the total , or 15% if only @xmath78 systems are considered ) .",
    "this is still a significant difference with the gdds composite . on the other hand ,",
    "high values of column density are found in other star  forming galaxies : the grb host galaxies , and the lbgs cb58 at @xmath13 ( table 3 ) .",
    "we note that when the background source is external to the galaxy ( as for qso  dlas ) the column density of an ion is higher than when the background source is inside the galaxy ( as for the gdds composite ) . in the former case",
    ", the line of sight crosses the entire galaxy , whereas in the latter only the gas in front of the stars is probed .",
    "the simplest situation would be that the stars are at the center , therefore the observed column is a factor of 2 less than what a background qso would see . for some distribution of stars and gas , the correction could be larger or smaller , but never downward .",
    "this would reinforce our findings of high column density in gdds galaxies with respect to typical column densities in qso  dlas .    similarly , in fig .",
    "8 we show the column densities in the ism of different galaxies .",
    "even if the number of detections is much lower , the trend shown by is confirmed . in the whole qso ",

    "dlas with detected have @xmath81 .",
    "comparable values are found , once again , in grb host galaxies and cb58 ( table 3 ) .",
    "the doublet is very strong in the gdds composite  ( fig .",

    "fe is more depleted in dust than mg , and [ mg / fe ] in the gas form is in the range @xmath89 [ mg / fe ] @xmath90 .",
    "a smaller content of fe with respect to mg is also expected in the case of @xmath91element enhancement ( mg is an @xmath9 element ) in metal poor systems .",
    "the low value of [ fe / mg ] found in the gdds composite  may also indicate that there is a residual saturation in the measured column density that is not taken into account .",
    "the absorption has been extensively studied along qso sight lines ( rao & turnshek 2000 ; churchill , vogt , & charlton 2003 ; ding et al .",
    "these absorbing clouds have been claimed to be associated with galaxy environment with @xmath92 .",
    "when the ew of the doublet is less than @xmath93  , the absorbing gas originates in halo clouds , while for larger ews , the system is very likely a dlas ( rao & turnshek 2000 ) . in grb afterglows ,",
    "the absorption is , when detected , very strong and often used to identify the redshift , since it can be detected in the optical up to @xmath94 . in fig .",
    "9 we show the doublet ews seen in qso sight  lines , grb afterglows , and gdds composite , as a function of redshift .",
    "the difference between qso sight  line studies and star  forming galaxies is apparent .",
    "unfortunately for lack of wavelength coverage we have no information on the ly@xmath9 absorption in our gdds spectra .",
    "therefore the column density and the metal content relative to hydrogen can not be derived .",
    "a rough estimate of the column density can be obtained using the correlation between the sfr surface density and the surface density , found by kennicutt ( 1998 ) for local disk galaxies .",
    "our slit aperture of 0.75 arcsec corresponds to a physical size ( at @xmath95 ) of 6.4 kpc .",
    "the signal along the @xmath96 direction has been extracted over 9.6 pixels ( average value for the 13 galaxies ) and this corresponds to 0.70 arcsec , or 5.9 kpc .",
    "if we assume that the detected flux comes from a @xmath97 kpc@xmath98 surface , and take the median sfr of the sample @xmath99 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 ( derived from [ ] emission ) , we obtain a sfr surface density :    @xmath100    which corresponds to a surface density of @xmath101 m@xmath6 pc@xmath102 ( @xmath103 dex dispersion ) , or to a column density @xmath104 . changing the sfr by 20% , would change the of @xmath105% . taking the column density determined with the cog ( @xmath8 ) , and assuming a moderate fe dust depletion , @xmath106 dex ( similar depletions are found in galactic warm disk and halo+disk gas clouds ; savage & sembach 1996 ) , we obtain a metallicity @xmath107 .",
    "the error includes 20% and 0.2 dex dispersion in the sfr and dust depletion , respectively , as well as the uncertainty in the and column densities .",
    "the median column density for 135 qso  dlas with @xmath78 is @xmath108 .",

    "high column densities have also been estimated in grb  000926 and grb  030323 ( table 3 ) .",

    "a deficiency of mn with respect to fe has been found in low metallicity stars , due to `` odd  even '' effect in the iron - peak element production .",

    "we have selected the uv brightest ( ab absolute magnitude @xmath3 ) subsample with 13 galaxies that are in the redshift range @xmath2  ( @xmath184 1.60 ) in order to study heavy elements in the neutral ism .",
    "the selected galaxies are the most massive in the sample ( @xmath72 m@xmath6 ) and represents between 25 and 38% of the total number of galaxies found in the @xmath4 range ( depending whether galaxies with tentative or photometric  only redshifts are included or not ) .",
    "only three of these 13 galaxies have @xmath185 .",
    "we detected strong [ ] emission associated with regions , with absolute luminosities ranging @xmath186 erg s@xmath7 , and roughly estimated sfr @xmath187 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 and @xmath188sfr@xmath189 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 .",
    "the mean value is close to the mean value derived using uv luminosities found from the aperture  corrected photometry ( @xmath190 m@xmath6 yr@xmath7 ) .",
    "this supports the assumption that on average the gas in the regions and the uv emitting stars are well mixed .",
    "the stack of the 13 spectra shows , , , and absorption .",
    "the column density of and provide a good measure of the total column density of iron and manganese in the neutral ism .",
    "we found @xmath8  and @xmath80 .",
    "these values are larger than what typically measured in absorption systems along qso sight lines ( qso  dlas ) . only 2 out of 24 at @xmath191 have similar column densities .",
    "on the other hand , high column densities are found in other star  forming objects .",
    "the lyman break galaxy cb58 has @xmath11  @xmath192 , while grb host galaxies ( grb  dlas ) have @xmath11  @xmath193 . from the depth of the absorption , we derived a conservative lower limit to the ism filling factor of 70% .",
    "the high filling factor of the ism and the consistency between sfrs derived from [ ] and uv emission , suggests a homogeneous distribution of stars and gas .",
    "if we assume that the mean column density in the ism is @xmath194 ( as in 98% of qso  dlas ) , the mean metallicty would be @xmath195 for a moderate fe dust depletion correction ( @xmath138 dex ) .",
    "high metallicities ( @xmath196 ) are also found in regions of galaxies at @xmath119 ( kobulnicky et al .",

    ", we estimated an optical dust obscuration @xmath197 mag .",

    ", the gdds will provide observations of two additional fields . from the full data set we will detect or give significant limits on other absorption lines . for instance",
    ", the detection at @xmath200  , or at @xmath201  , are powerful diagnostics for metal enrichment and dust depletion .",
    "gdds galaxies and grb  dlas are clearly probing high@xmath202 galaxies with a strong star formation activity , for which metal enrichment and/or dust obscuration can be higher than in the qso  dla population .",
    "our conclusion is that direct detections of galaxies , and indirect through qso absorption lines , provide a more complete picture of the galaxy census in the high redshift universe .",
    "the former can be seen only if star formation is high , the latter only when metal enrichment is low .",
