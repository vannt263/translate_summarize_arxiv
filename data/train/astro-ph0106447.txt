    "hunten , kozlowski & sprague published the results of a 3-day campaign of observations , during which the na abundance increased by 60% at 80@xmath3 south , while that at the equator remained unchanged .",
    "they suggested that the cause may have been a meteor shower , undetected by radar or by other measurements , impacting near the south pole of the moon . in 1998",
    "verani et al . reported a set of high - resolution spectra taken 4.5 days before the maximum of the 1995 leonids , with the same observational technique used for the observations reported here , as described in cremonese & verani ( 1997 ) and in sprague et al .",
    "they found significant enhancements of the brightness and temperature ( scale - height ) of the na atmosphere compared with previous observations at similar lunar phase and local solar zenith angle .",
    "since the impact - generated component of the atmosphere has the highest expected temperature , the measured increase in temperature may be associated with increased meteor activity during the leonids .",
    "a similar enhancement was detected during the maximum of the 1997 leonids , at mount lemmon and asiago observatories @xcite .",
    "these measurements appear to be confirmed by observations taken with a different technique during the night of the 1998 leonids maximum @xcite .",
    "the authors reported the detection of a region of neutral na emission in the direction of the antisolar / lunar point in the 3 nights around new moon phase ( 18 - 20 november 1998 ) , suggesting as the most likely cause the detection of the tail of the moon s atmosphere , i.e. its escaping component , driven outwards by solar radiation pressure .",
    "a model of these results @xcite indicates an increase of a factor of 2 or 3 in the amount of na escaping during the peak of the leonids .    despite these observations ,",
    "many issues remain to be resolved before one can conclude with certainty that meteor showers are responsible for the observed enhancements .",
    "in fact the lunar atmosphere shows time variations , the nature of which is not fully understood ( sprague et al .",
    "1998 ; smith et al .",
    "a measurement of enhanced na emission from the moon during a meteor shower other than the leonids would strongly support the hypothesis that these showers are an important source of the transient na atmosphere , both on the moon and on other solar - system bodies with thin atmospheres . in terms of mass flux ( g  @xmath4  s@xmath5 )",
    ", the quadrantids are the most intense meteor stream ; in fact if we compare the mass flux of the meteor streams and the mass flux of the sporadic meteoroids reported in table  [ parameters ] , we can see the micrometeoritic flux could increase up to 30% - 50% during the quadrantids . from this point of view , this stream gives a good opportunity to test the impact mechanism ; we therefore observed the lunar atmosphere during the 1999 quadrantid meteor shower .",

    "the moon was full on jan 2 , at 02:49 .",
    "the sun was quiet .",
    "the diameter of the magnetotail is about 52 earth radii at the moon s orbit @xcite , which means that the moon was inside the magnetotail on the first night of the observations ( phase angle  =  14@xmath6 ) . on the second night ( phase angle  =  26@xmath6 ) the moon was near the predicted position of the magnetopause , and thus its location with respect to magnetotail and magnetosheath is uncertain .",

    "in addition , the mlt dynamics group of the university of wales ( v.  s.  howells and h.  r.  middleton private communication ) used the radar station at aberystwyth , uk , detecting a maximum on january 4 , with activity two to three times higher than the preceding and following nights .",

    "the brightness and temperature we measured during the quadrantids are in good agreement with most of the measurements made when there was no meteor shower , i.e. the 1999 quadrantids had no detectable effect on the lunar na atmosphere .",
    "these results may indicate that meteor impacts could have significant influence on the moon s atmosphere only under particular conditions , so that the detected difference in the effects of the two streams may be due to physical differences between the two streams .",
    "in fact the production of gas after an impact depends on various factors , including the velocity , mass , and composition of the impactors .",
    "the two streams differ in many parameters ( cf .",
    "table  [ parameters ] ) , the impact velocity being one of the greatest : the mean impact velocity of the leonids ( orbiting the sun in the opposite direction to the earth and moon ) is 70.7  km  s@xmath5 , much higher than that of the quadrantids ( 41.0  km  s@xmath5 ) .",
    "okeefe & ahrens ( 1977 ) have found that the amount of gas generated by an impact is proportional to the factor s=(@xmath18/@xmath19)(v / c@xmath20)@xmath8 , where v is the impact velocity , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are respectively the density of the projectile and of the target , and c@xmath20 is the bulk sound velocity in the target .",
    "starting from this model , morgan , zook & potter ( 1988 ) calculated the amount of gas produced by impacts having impactor - target densities ratio of 1 and sound speed in the target of 7.44  km / s ( estimated for mercury s regolith components ) .",
    "they found that a negligible amount of gas is produced at velocities below 23 km / s ( less than the mass of the projectile ) ; at progressive velocities this amount increases , becoming proportional to v@xmath8 , i.e. to the kinetic energy , for velocities higher than 44 km / s , ( cf .",
    "therein ) . in our case",
    "( cometary grains into lunar regolith ) the density ratio is @xmath21  1 ( 0.7 - 3 g/@xmath22 vs 2.3 - 2.7 g/@xmath22 ) , so the threshold velocity should be higher than the ones previously reported ( up to 45 km / s ) .",
    "cintala ( 1992 ) in a model of high - velocity micrometeoroid impacts in the regolith , also found that vapour production increases with impact velocity .",
    "this model suggests that a difference of a factor 2 for the impact velocity yields a factor of almost 3 in the amount of material melted , and a factor of more than 4 in the amount of target material vaporised .",
    "the effects of high - velocity impacts have also been investigated in the laboratory ( eichhorn 1978 ) , using a variety of materials for the targets and for the impactors .",
    "the impact velocities ranged from 3 to 15  km / s , and the masses from 10@xmath23 to 10@xmath24  g with a size of few microns ; both ranges are unfortunately lower than the typical ones for the leonids and quadrantids .",
    "this experiment shows that the temperature of the generated gas increases with the impact velocity ( this could explain the enhancement of the temperature of the na atmosphere during the leonids ) .",
    "these results seem to confirm also the theoretical prediction of a low vapor production for such impact velocities , as the mass of gas produced is less than twice the mass of the impactor body .",
    "on the other hand , schultz ( 1996 ) found that the vaporization increases with the square ( or even higher power ) of the velocity , even for velocities of 3 - 10  km / s , inconsistent with the hypothesis of a `` threshold '' velocity .",
    "the mean kinetic energies delivered per unit area and time by the leonids ( after 1994 ) and quadrantids are of the same order of magnitude , so the different impact velocities of the two streams may be responsible for the observed differences only if the threshold velocity is real .",
    "different chemical compositions of the streams may affect the composition , e.g. , the na abundance , of the gas produced .",
    "spectroscopic measurements of the airglow were made during the leonid shower ( chu 2000 , nagasawa 1978 ) , suggesting a higher content of na in leonids with respect other meteoroids .",
    "moreover , borovicka et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found in their spectroscopic observations of the leonid meteors that smaller meteoroids tend to be poorer in na than larger ones , and a similar behaviour was found for the perseids .",
    "imek ( 1986 ) investigated the mass distribution of five meteor streams ( geminids , quadrantids , perseids , leonids , and giacobinids ) and of the sporadics observed with the radar . in his results",
    "he found an absence of larger particles in the quadrantids ( and also in the sporadics ) .",
    "these results suggest that the na content of the quadrantids is lower than that of the leonids .",
    "finally , age could also play a role in depleting the content of volatiles in quadrantids meteoroids .",
    "the quadrantids are much older than the leonids , being created 7500 ( babadzhanov & ibrunov 1992 ) or 500 years ago ( jenniskens 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , because the quadrantids have a shorter orbital period ( 5.3 years , vs 33 years for the leonids ) , they have passed close to the sun more often , resulting in greater evaporation of volatile elements , such as na , leaving the meteoritic particles depleted in these elements .",
    "no enhancement of the na emission from the lunar atmosphere was detected during the quadrantids meteor shower .",
    "this contrasts with the reported enhancements seen during at least three of the leonids showers . as a possible explaination",
    "we suggest the differences in the physical and chemical parameters of the two streams , as widely explained in the previous section . to investigate this hypothesis new measurements of hypervelocity impacts with a velocity range resembling the one for the meteor showers and on a target more closely approximating the the lunar regolith , or accurate modelling of such impacts ,",
    "are required .",
    "measurements of the chemical composition of the meteoroids are also required , as well as new observations of the lunar atmosphere during other major meteor streams . for these reasons",
