    "recent results at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite are in excellent agreement with the standard model ( sm ) with a 125 gev higgs boson and thus far any significant deviation from the sm has not been reported . on the other hand ,",
    "the current measurements of the higgs and top quark masses @xcite suggest the metastability of our vacuum @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; the higgs potential becomes negative typically at @xmath1 gev @xcite .",
    "it may be an important hint for high - energy physics .",
    "one of the important ingredients in modern cosmology is inflation .",
    "it expands the primordial universe at an accelerating rate .",
    "it solves the flatness and horizon problems and sows the seeds of the large scale structure of the present universe . within the current errors",
    ", there still remains a possibility of the sm - higgs - driven inflation @xcite .",
    "however , if the higgs potential is negative at @xmath1 gev , such higgs inflation models can not occur unless there is a physics beyond the sm that keeps the higgs potential positive up to the inflationary scale because the higgs field value during inflation is required to be larger than @xmath2 gev in these models . in this paper , we assume that the electroweak vacuum is metastable and inflation is driven by a scalar field other than the sm higgs field , called inflaton .",
    "the current data suggests that the lifetime of the electroweak vacuum is longer than the age of the universe @xcite , and there is no constraint on the reheating temperature from the thermal - fluctuation - triggered electroweak vacuum decay @xcite .",
    "however , the vacuum fluctuation in the quasi - de sitter background of the higgs field during inflation may also push it to the unwanted anti de sitter ( ads ) vacuum if the hubble parameter during inflation is large , _",
    "e.g. _ , as the recent bicep2 result suggests @xcite .- mode results . ]",
    "thus , it may spoil inflation or , at least , our universe that lands in the metastable vacuum may be unlikely .",
    "therefore , low - energy scale inflation may be favored in this viewpoint , contrary to the bicep2 result @xcite , as discussed in other recent literatures @xcite .    as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , it can be avoided by supposing a coupling between inflaton and the sm higgs field without giving any major effects on the dynamics of inflaton .",
    "this is because the coupling produces the `` hubble - induced mass '' during inflation , which pushes the field value where the higgs potential goes negative to a much larger value . in the case where the induced mass is much larger than the hubble parameter @xcite and",
    "the higgs potential remains positive up to the planck scale , the higgs field is quickly pushed to the origin and its fluctuation is suppressed .",
    "thus , the unwanted vacuum decay can be avoided even if the initial field value of the higgs field is relatively large , @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the reduced planck mass .",
    "consequently , the electroweak vacuum can be naturally selected .",
    "on the other hand , if the induced mass is smaller than the hubble parameter , it seems to be difficult to suppress the quantum fluctuations and hence the vacuum decay can not be avoided even if the higgs field initially sits at the origin . in this paper , however , we point out that if the number of @xmath0-folds during inflation is not too large , we can construct a scenario with a high - scale inflation in which most part of the universe can avoid the vacuum decay while the induced mass is not so large , as is also recently suggested in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this is because the evolution of the expectation value of the higgs field during inflation is suppressed and it can be than the field value of the potential barrier if the hubble - induced mass @xmath5 is large enough , @xmath6 and the number of @xmath0-folds during inflation is not too large . in addition , if the reheating temperature is high enough , the present universe can be safely realized .",
    "note that after inflation the higgs field still slow - rolls and the time - dependent potential barrier may catch it up .",
    "the higgs field will roll down towards the unwanted ads vacuum in this case .",
    "if the higgs field is thermalized before being caught up by the potential barrier , the higgs field safely settles down to the electroweak vacuum . owing to a relatively high reheating temperature , the higgs field is thermalized earlier . here",
    "we give a rough estimate for such a healthy scenario .",
    "we also point out that it would be possible to verify such a high reheating temperature by the future gravitational wave experiments .",
    "let us start from the sm higgs potential . at the large field values @xmath7",
    "gev , it is well described by @xmath8 in the unitary gauge .",
    "the higgs quartic coupling @xmath9 runs logarithmically with respect to @xmath10 from @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the higgs mass . as is studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , the higgs quartic coupling becomes negative at @xmath13 gev .",
    "though the uncertainties in the higgs and top mass data lead to the uncertainty in the point where the potential goes negative ranging from @xmath14 gev to the planck scale or higher , here we consider the case where the higgs potential vanishes typically at @xmath15 gev .",
    "then , the higgs potential has also a maximum or a `` barrier '' at @xmath16 gev .",
    "if the hubble parameter during inflation @xmath17 is larger than @xmath18 , the fluctuation of the higgs field easily climbs up the potential barrier and rolls down to the unwanted true vacuum during inflation even when it initially sits at the origin  @xcite .",
    "it is claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the regions or the bubbles where the higgs field falls into the unwanted true vacuum collapse due to the ads instability and hence only the regions where the higgs field is inside the potential barrier may remain . consequently the metastable electroweak vacuum and high - scale inflation may be compatible .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the universe expands properly by inflation and the ads bubble does not cause any cosmological disasters . in particular , if the ads bubbles of the true vacuum `` eat '' the region where the present electroweak vacuum is selected , the existence of our universe falls into a crisis . therefore",
    ", we can say inflation with a relatively small hubble parameter @xmath19 is safe in the light of the current data of the higgs and top mass .",
    "it is contradictory to the recent bicep2 result , which suggests @xmath20 gev @xcite , if the observed @xmath21-mode is generated by the primordial gravitational waves .    as is pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite and studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , the higgs field can acquire a hubble - induced mass due to its interaction with the inflaton @xmath22 .",
    "for example , the `` higgs - portal '' coupling @xmath23 with @xmath24 gives an effective positive mass squared @xmath25 during and after inflation . here",
    "the bracket represents the time average . in the case of massive chaotic inflation @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 during inflation and @xmath28 in the inflaton oscillation dominated era after inflation .",
    ", at the oscillating phase .",
    "] thus , the effective higgs mass squared is proportional to the hubble squared both during and after inflation , @xmath29 .",
    "note that in order for the quantum correction not to dominate the tree level potential , @xmath30 is required  @xcite .",
    "a similar effect can be achieved by a non - minimal coupling of the higgs field to gravity .",
    "suppose that the einstein - hilbert action is replaced by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the determinant of the metric , @xmath33 is a negative parameter , and @xmath34 is the scalar curvature .",
    "the effect of this term can be seen easily in the einstein frame . by performing the conformal transformation and changing the frame to the einstein frame ,",
    "we get the effective higgs potential as @xmath35 during inflation we have @xmath36 , and during inflaton oscillation dominated era after inflation we have @xmath37 with @xmath38 . here",
    "we assumed that the inflaton oscillates in the quadratic potential around its potential minimum .",
    "thus , the higgs field acquires positive mass squared @xmath39 during and after inflation with @xmath40 being a parameter of order of @xmath41 .    motivated by the interactions discussed above ,",
    "now we consider a simple modification of the higgs potential during inflation , @xmath42 with @xmath43 being a positive numerical parameter . here",
    "we consider the case @xmath44 and study vacuum fluctuation in this potential .",
    "for @xmath45 , the hubble - induced potential overwhelms the original potential around @xmath46 and the potential barrier moves to a higher field value . in principle",
    ", we should calculate the running of the couplings to study the dynamics of the higgs field .",
    "however , they vary only logarithmically with respect to @xmath10 and hence we can treat them as constants , _ e.g. , _ a negative quartic coupling @xmath47 , in the first approximation . then , we obtain the field value at the potential barrier as @xmath48 which is roughly ten times larger than the hubble parameter during inflation for @xmath49 .",
    "the higgs field receives quantum fluctuations during inflation and acquires nonvanishing expectation value .",
    "if @xmath43 is not too small , we can neglect the quartic term in the potential for the higgs field . for the higgs field that initially sits at the origin ,",
    "the expectation value of the higgs field is evaluated as @xcite @xmath50 , \\label{condc}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the number of @xmath0-folds during inflation .",
    "it is still under discussion what is the correct survival condition ,- folds during inflation than the would - be number of @xmath0-folds is required to compensate the collapsed ads regions and to reproduce our universe . in the latter case ,",
    "the hubble - induced mass must be larger than @xmath52 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the condition @xmath53 is adopted for the stability condition . here",
    "@xmath54 is the potential energy at the potential barrier . ]",
    "and here we require @xmath55 as its representative .",
    "then , we acquire the constraint on the hubble - induced mass as @xmath56 regardless of the hubble parameter during inflation . here",
    "we have approximated @xmath57 .",
    "note that eq .   neglects the quartic term in the potential , and hence at the boundary values of @xmath43 in eq .",
    ", this approximation is no longer valid .",
    "the expectation value should be a little larger .",
    "however , the validity of this approximation recovers for a little larger value of @xmath43 . in this sense ,",
    "eq .   gives a most optimistic constraint that can be used as a reference .",
    "strictly speaking , we must calculate the probability distribution function ( pdf ) by using the stochastic approach or the fokker - planck approach @xcite to estimate the survival probability .",
    "we have instead performed numerical calculation to solve the langevin equations @xcite .",
    "see appendix [ appb ] for the detail of the numerical calculation .",
    "figure  [ fig : hist ] shows the histogram of the higgs field value at @xmath58 and 100 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with @xmath61 trials .",
    "we find that for @xmath62 , the distribution is fitted by the gaussian function with eq .",
    "( @xmath63 ) .",
    "one may surprised that the distribution is narrower than those expected eq .",
    "( @xmath63 ) for smaller @xmath43 .",
    "this is because the distribution is during the course of ( linear ) spreading . as a result",
    ", many trials end inside the potential walls . due to the negative quartic term",
    ", the tail of the distribution is broader than that of the gaussian distribution and the higgs field expectation value is not so small .",
    "figure  [ fig : ave ] shows the @xmath43 dependese of the higgs field expectation value with @xmath58 and 100 .",
    "we can find for the `` just enough inflation '' , @xmath58 , the expectation value of the higgs field is well described by eq .   with @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that for the parameter that satisfies eq .  , the probability for the higgs field to sit inside the potential barrier during inflation is not suppressed exponentially and it gives an appropriately optimistic condition for the survival of the electroweak vacuum .",
    "hereafter we use eq .   with @xmath64 as a representative constraint .",
    "we also use @xmath65 , which is the constraint for @xmath66 , as a reference . note that for inflation with a larger number of @xmath0-folds , @xmath67 , the expectation value of the higgs field diverges since the potential is not unbounded from the below , and the survival probability is , again , exponentially small .",
    "therefore , the small hubble - induced mass does not help the stability of the electro weak vacuum during inflation .",
    "however , since for @xmath67 , the expectation value we evaluated is the average in the whole universe that is covered dominantly by unobservable region , anthropic principle would also matter , and hence we focus on the case where @xmath68          [ tevatron electroweak working group and cdf and d0 collaborations ] , arxiv:1107.5255 [ hep - ex ] ; [ atlas and cdf and cms and d0 collaborations ] , arxiv:1403.4427 [ hep - ex ]",
