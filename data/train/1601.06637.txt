    "the phase structure of qcd matter has always been an important and attractive topic in theoretical physics @xcite . in relativistic heavy - ion collisions ,",
    "the produced qcd matter will go though a phase transition or a crossover as time goes by .",
    "either way , the state of qcd matter is believed to change from quark - gluon plasma to hadronic matter in this process .",
    "its physical properties and dynamical behaviors such as chiral symmetry and confinement are altered along with the change of the state .    at the early stage of noncentral collision , the qcd matter produces extremely strong magnetic field @xcite , which brings about obvious magnetic effects . therefore studying qcd matter s properties under the influence of magnetic field becomes a meaningful and important subject .",
    "so far , many relevant theories and models have been proposed and it is shown that the quark condensate are strengthened by magnetic field , which is known as ` magnetic catalysis ' @xcite . consequently , the qcd phase diagram is related to magnetic field @xcite .",
    "njl model is quite a useful and convenient tool to qualitatively study qcd matter states @xcite . for a njl model",
    "we usually apply mean field approximation to deal with the four fermion interaction terms , namely , @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "it is believed that this approximation is equivalent to dyson - schwinger equations with contact interaction treatment , hence the gap equation can be written as @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4    in the above equations , @xmath5 represents self - energy of fermion propagator , it contains dynamical mass @xmath6 , which is generated by non - perturbative effect , more specifically , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking . generally speaking",
    ", there is @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ gap ] ) , which leads to @xmath8 .",
    "therefore it is usually more convenient to study dynamical mass directly rather than discuss a general form of self - energy .",
    "but in m. asakawa and k. yazaki s work @xcite , they have pointed that , in a self - consistent mean - field approximation , the self - energy does not simply equal dynamical mass , which reveals with the help of the fierz transformation .",
    "when chemical potential @xmath9 is not zero , the actual self - energy should be written as @xmath10 to guarantee the self - consistency of gap equation ( [ gap ] ) . in this new @xmath5 , we can combine @xmath11 with chemical potential as a renormalized chemical potential @xmath12 .    in this paper ,",
    "we are about to study the self - energy problem in two flavor njl model with temperature , chemical potential and external magnetic field , the self - energy must not simply equal dynamical mass . in order to find out the appropriate and complete self - energy , we start from the most general form , a @xmath13 matrix ( spinor space and flavor space ) , and rule out its inappropriate parts .",
    "the detail is discussed in appendix a.",
    "a two - flavor njl model lagrangian with external magnetic field in minkowski space is @xmath14,\\label{njl}\\ ] ] @xmath15 @xmath16 we also define a flavor index ` f ' for convenience , @xmath17      at finite temperature @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 through eq .",
    "( [ gap2 ] ) and eq .",

    "( [ a ] ) , we can treat @xmath32 as a free variable and then focus on solving eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) .",
    "one can also prove that when @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , eq . ( [ sigma ] ) will degenerate into classic gap equation with external magnetic field @xmath36 which means we can apply the same regularization scheme ( referring to @xcite ) to proper time @xmath37 in eq .

    "( [ b ] ) , @xmath38 we choose @xmath39    through numerical analysis , we find that when the solutions of @xmath6 are nonzero , @xmath40 s values are always far smaller than @xmath6 s but nonzero neither , therefore it is reasonable to simplify eq .",

    "( [ sigma2 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ b2 ] ) do not have solutions for @xmath6 and @xmath40 any more , because at these points , dynamical mass @xmath6 jumps to zero ( wigner solution ) and chiral phase transition happens . in these cases ,",

    "( [ b ] ) without approximation .",
    "the wigner solution always exist , actually in order to deduce eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ gap2 ] ) , we cancel a common factor @xmath6 from both sides of an intermediate equation , which implies @xmath48 is always a solution .",
    "so we can say that when the wigner solution @xmath48 is preferred , @xmath40 is proportional to both renormalized chemical potential and magnetic field . here , it should be noted that this phenomenon has not been found in the previous literatures .",
    "dependance of dynamical mass @xmath6 with fixed temperature and different @xmath46s , @xmath49.[ti],width=288 ]     dependance of dynamical mass @xmath6 with fixed temperature and different @xmath46s , @xmath50.[tii],width=288 ]     dependance of dynamical mass @xmath6 with fixed @xmath46 and different temperatures , @xmath51.[ebi],width=288 ]     dependance of dynamical mass @xmath6 with fixed @xmath46 and different temperatures , @xmath52.[ebii],width=288 ]     dependance of dynamical mass @xmath6 with fixed temperature and different chemical potentials , @xmath49.[inverse],width=288 ]    referring to figs .",
    "( [ ti])-([ebii ] ) , the dynamical mass @xmath6 has first order phase transition when renormalized chemical potential reaches a critical point , of course this critical point depends on temperature and magnetic field . generally speaking ,",
    "the stronger magnetic field and lower temperature is , the bigger dynamical mass is generated .",
    "however in fig .",
    "( [ ti ] ) , when @xmath32 crosses a specific point , the @xmath53 line and @xmath54 line show us inverse magnetic catalysis effect , which means the stronger magnetic field is , the smaller dynamical mass is generated .",
    "we can also gain a vivid cognition from fig .",
    "( [ inverse ] ) .",
    "for njl model , inverse magnetic catalysis does not always exist at other temperatures , for example , in fig .",
    "( [ tii ] ) , @xmath50 , catalysis effect is not inverse .",
    "dependance of @xmath40 with fixed temperature and different @xmath46s , @xmath49.[t1],width=288 ]     dependance of @xmath40 with fixed temperature and different @xmath46s , @xmath50.[t2],width=288 ]     dependance of @xmath40 with fixed @xmath46 and different temperatures , @xmath51.[eb1],width=288 ]     dependance of @xmath40 with fixed temperature and different temperatures , @xmath52.[eb2],width=288 ]    comparing with @xmath6-@xmath32 relations , the corresponding @xmath40-@xmath32 relations are shown in figs .",
    "( [ t1])-([eb2 ] ) . from these relations ,",
    "one can see that , @xmath40-@xmath32 and @xmath6-@xmath32 relations show gaps at the same critical @xmath32 . after crossing these critical @xmath32 , @xmath40-@xmath32 relations are strictly linear correlative because of eq .",
    "( [ b0 ] ) .",
    "similar to dynamical mass , with fixed temperature , the stronger magnetic field is , the bigger value of @xmath40 is , but unlike dynamical mass , with magnetic field fixed , lower temperature makes smaller value of @xmath40 before @xmath32 reaching critical points .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the self - energy of njl model in the presence of temperature , chemical potential and external magnetic field , it turns out when chemical potential is nonzero , the self - energy is no longer equivalent to dynamical mass . in order to establish correct gap equations , one has to employ a full self - energy structure first , and then use some self - consistent conditions or symmetries to simplify the structure .    in the new self - energy ( [ form ] ) , @xmath6 still stands for dynamical mass .",
    "similar to dynamical mass , @xmath11 could be thought as dynamical chemical potential , but its existence depends on the existence of original chemical potential @xmath9 , it appears to be the modification of original chemical potential . by analyzing numerical results , we find @xmath40 s values are always much smaller than @xmath6 s when @xmath6 has non - zero solutions , which implies @xmath40 s existence only quantitatively modifies dynamical mass a little rather than qualitatively changes the properties of dynamical mass during phase transition . therefore assuming self - energy equals dynamical mass is a reasonable approximation , and it suffices to calculate dynamical mass only .",
    "nevertheless , after phase transition , dynamical mass becomes zero , @xmath40 will be simply proportional to magnetic field and renormalized chemical potential , which brings about two meaningful results : firstly , self - energy in wigner phase is no longer trivial at chiral limit , although dynamical mass remains zero , @xmath11 , @xmath40 change along with temperature , chemical potential and magnetic field . secondly ,",
    "if chemical potential or magnetic field is large enough , @xmath40 s values would bring about possible observable effects . importantly in physics , @xmath40 causes splitting of dispersion relation according to eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) . especially in wigner phase , @xmath40 is capable of acquiring bigger values , hence the dispersion relation eq .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) is rewritten as @xmath55 apparently , at specific momentum and landau level , one particle can have two different energies .    as shown in eqs .",
    "( [ dispersion ] ) and ( [ dispersion2 ] ) , the physical effects induced by @xmath40 depend on dispersion relation , the change of dispersion relation causes different particle number densities . in this paper ,",
    "the strength of magnetic field ranges from @xmath56 to @xmath57gev@xmath58 , which correspond approximately around @xmath59-@xmath60 gauss .",
    "this is nearly the strongest magnetic field in experiments , and even so , the physical effects are still too small to be distinguished from experiments .",
    "we are looking forward to other conditions that can bring us obvious effects .",
    "large space scale could enlarge tiny modification in dispersion relation , for example , magnestar , one kind of neutron star , which is expected to have magnetic field of @xmath61 gauss , although this strength is much smaller than the strength we employ in this paper , magnestars have large volumes .",
    "on the other hand , we can also simply expect larger magnetic field to show obvious effects in future experiments .",
    "it is believed that in early universe , the magnetic field could reach @xmath62 gauss , hence the results in this paper may play an important role in early universe evolution .",
    "the inverse magnetic catalysis effect mentioned in fig .",
    "( [ inverse ] ) is not exactly the same as the well - known inverse magnetic catalysis studied in these articles @xcite .",
    "the lattice results show inverse magnetic catalysis happens at @xmath63 , @xmath64 .",
    "but in njl model , this can not happen with mean field approximation at least . in njl model ,",
    "when chemical potential is small enough , the dynamical mass strictly obeys the rule of magnetic catalysis .",
    "we are looking forward to use other methods beyond mean field approximation to find out inverse magnetic catalysis in njl model .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite , if one wants to apply mean field approximation to eq .",
    "( [ njl ] ) , only making @xmath65 and @xmath66 to be mean fields is not enough .",
    "instead , one should make fierz transformation firstly , this will provide us more four fermion interaction terms , and then we can apply mean field approximation to each four fermion terms .",
    "hence we are led to a complex self - energy @xmath67 , which should be a @xmath13 matrix . through the discussion in the appendix b of ref .",
    "@xcite , we can simplify this self - energy to @xmath68 , and the gap equation is simply written as @xmath69 @xmath70    now @xmath5 becomes a @xmath71 matrix , it must be the linear combination of the sixteen matrices @xmath72 . from the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ gap2 ] ) , we know that @xmath5 should be a coordinate ( or momentum ) irrelevant matrix . noticing @xmath73 , we are sure that @xmath5 does not include @xmath74 terms",
    ". @xmath5 does not have @xmath75 and @xmath76 terms neither because the original lagrangian eq .",
    "( [ njl ] ) does not violate parity symmetry .",
    "since magnetic field @xmath77 is parallel to @xmath78 axis , the lorentz invariance is broken into @xmath79 symmetry in @xmath80 plane , which implies that the @xmath81 terms ( @xmath82 ) should be proportional to @xmath83 , and @xmath84 terms ( @xmath82 ) should be proportional to @xmath85 .",
    "however these requests conflict with the statement that @xmath5 is a coordinate or momentum irrelevant matrix in the beginning .",
    "therefore @xmath5 does not have @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( @xmath82 ) terms neither .",
    "as for @xmath88 term , it only causes a shift to @xmath89 , and the integral of @xmath89 makes it trivial .",
