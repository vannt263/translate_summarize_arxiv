    ", the presence of magnetic fields may affect the evolution of curvature inhomogeneities in a way that is reminiscent of what happens in the presence of a non - adiabatic pressure fluctuations .",
    "suppose , indeed , that large - scale magnetic fields are generated thanks to the amplification of the quantum fluctuations of an abelian gauge field which can be identified with the hypercharge field whose modes will not be screened by thermal effects . in spite of the specific model of parametric amplification , the result of the process will be a stochastically distributed field whose two point function can be written as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the magnetic power spectrum ( which may change depending upon the specific way the weyl invariance is broken ) and @xmath2 is the traceless projector . in eq .",

    "when @xmath7 the evolution equations of the perturbations of the spatial curvature will receive contributions from three independent sources .",
    "the adiabatic mode typically provides the first contribution arising from the quantum fluctuations of a ( single ) inflaton field .",
    "the second contribution may come from a collection of non - adiabatic modes that may be present either because the inflationary evolution is driven by more than one scalar degree of freedom , or because the primordial plasma contains a number of spectator fields which do not drive the evolution of the background but whose inhomogeneities contribute to the overall fluctuations of the spatial curvature .",
    "finally , the third contribution to the evolution of curvature fluctuations can be attributed to gravitating magnetic fields . up to now",
    "various studies addressed the interplay between large - scale magnetic fields and the scalar @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , vector @xcite and tensor @xcite modes of the geometry ( see @xcite and @xcite for two recent reviews ) .",
    "as far as the scalar modes are concerned , it was assumed that large - scale magnetic fields are present prior to recombination ( but after equality ) and the resulting corrections to the sachs - wolfe plateau have been computed @xcite .",
    "the analysis has been also recently extended to cover the doppler region , i.e. the first , second and third peaks of the temperature autocorrelations @xcite .",
    "the main theme of the present paper will be to discuss possible ( further ) numerical constraints arising from the coupled evolution of large - scale magnetic fields and curvature perturbations .",
    "this analysis , when correctly performed , allows to assess the theoretical uncertainty of the computational scheme .",
    "in fact , the results obtained in the case of the conventional thermal history can be compared with the estimates stemming from less conventional ( but phenomenologically allowed ) post - inflationary evolutions .    in the most simplisticcdm paradigm .",
    "these three data include , in general terms , the large - scale structure observations , by the cmb observations and by the type ia supernovae observations . before plunging into the discussion ,",
    "it is appropriate to comment on the choice of the cosmological parameters that will be employed throughout this section .",
    "the wmap data @xcite have been combined , so far , with various sets of data .",
    "these data sets include the 2df galaxy redshift survey @xcite , the combination of boomerang and acbar data @xcite , the combination of cbi and vsa data @xcite . furthermore the wmap 3-year data have been also combined with the hubble space telescope key project ( hstkp ) data @xcite as well as with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite data . finally , the wmap 3-year data can be also usefully combined with the weak lensing data @xcite and with the observations of type ia supernovae ( in particular the data of the supernova legacy survey ( snls ) @xcite and the so - called supernova `` gold sample '' ( sngs ) @xcite ) . ] scenario a conventional inflationary phase is followed , after a sudden reheating , by a radiation - dominated phase which is replaced , at equality by the standard matter - dominated phase .",
    "this evolutionary history allows to compute the curvature perturbations that are induced , for instance , by a single primordial adiabatic mode .",
    "it is also possible , in the same framework , to include the peculiar effect of large - scale magnetic fields whose inhomogeneities may indeed affect the curvature perturbations @xcite . the result of this calculation allows the estimate of the sachs - wolfe plateau and , ultimately , the estimate of the doppler oscillations @xcite .    if the evolutionary history of the background geometry changes in its early phases , also the effect of large - scale magnetic fields on the induced curvature perturbations will be different .",
    "the evolution of magnetized curvature perturbations is sensitive , both , to the total barotropic index and to the total sound speed , i.e. @xmath8 where the prime denotes a derivation with respect to @xmath3 and the subscript t reminds that the barotropic index and the sound speed are the ones pertaining to the _ total _ fluid .",
    "if the rate of expansion changes in the early phases of the thermal history of the universe ( typically prior to big bang nucleosynthesis ) also @xmath9 and @xmath10 will be different and the curvature perturbations will have a slightly different evolution .",
    "this qualitative argument will now be corroborated by a detailed calculation and this is one of the themes of the present investigation .",
    "the problem then becomes to estimate the total curvature perturbation that will be sensitive both to the adiabatic and to the magnetized contributions .    the strategy adopted in the present investigation",
    "will then be to scrutinize different thermodynamic histories of the universe and to compute , in each of these cases , the resulting curvature perturbations for wavelengths that are still larger than the hubble radius after matter - radiation equality .",
    "it will be shown that possible variations in the evolution of the total barotropic index will modify the interplay between the adiabatic and the magnetized components of curvature perturbations .",
    "this procedure will also allow to determine the theoretical error caused by selecting the most simplistic thermal history in comparison with its non - minimal counterparts .",
    "the plan of the present analysis will then be the following . in section 2",
    "the essential theoretical tools will be introduced .",
    "a consistent gauge - invariant description will allow to follow , in one shot , the evolution of the curvature fluctuations and of the density contrasts on comoving orthogonal hypersurfaces . in section",

    "the source of the possible confusion is , in short , the following .",
    "the field @xmath150 is the value of the magnetic field at recombination redshifted to the present epoch and assuming magnetic flux conservation which is well justified since the value of the conductivity is always rather large .",
    "however , @xmath154 _ is not _ the present value of the magnetic field intensity observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters .",
    "the rationale for this statement is that during the gravitational collapse of protogalaxies the magnetic field intensity @xmath150 will be amplified by compressional amplification and , probably , also by some dynamo action .",
    "assuming just compressional amplification ( which is the most certain aspect of the dynamics ) the amplification factor may be of the order @xmath155 or even @xmath156 .",
    "notice that , from eq .",
    "( [ b6 ] ) the nearly scale - invariant limit is achieved for @xmath157 . furthermore , as discussed elsewhere , the power spectrum of the magnetic energy density , being quartic in the field intensities , is computed in terms of the appropriate convolutions that have been evaluated , to get to eq .",
    "( [ b6 ] ) , for @xmath158 .",
    "it should be borne in mind that , in the opposite case ( i.e. @xmath159 ) the magnetic energy density has a violet spectrum .",
    "this implies that , at very large length - scales the gravitational effect will be negligible and that , furthermore , the most significant bounds on the intensity of the magnetic field will come from comoving momenta close to the diffusion scale .",
    "notice that the nearly scale - invariant spectrum is rather suggestive also because it would imply a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of large - scale magnetic fields from galaxies , to clusters , to super - clusters",
    ". this observation is , today , beyond our observational capabilities .",
    "however , by looking at recent determinations of magnetic fields in clusters and in some typical supercluster , it is indeed tempting to speculate that the resulting power spectrum of the magnetic energy density is nearly scale - invariant .",
    "the correlation function of curvature perturbations enters directly the determination of the ordinary sachs - wolfe contribution which is the dominant source of temperature anisotropies at large angular scales .",
    "let us require that the magnetized contribution is always much smaller than the adiabatic contribution .",
    "so , we will assume , in a rather conservative approach , that the magnetized contribution is always smaller ( by a factor @xmath160 ) than the adiabatic contribution .",
    "the parameter @xmath160 can be @xmath161 , in a conservative approach . following this strategy the magnetic field intensity",
    "can be bounded in each thermal history of the universe .",
    "consider , for instance , the plots appearing in fig .",
    "( [ b1 ] ) where , on the vertical axis , the base 10 logarithm of the smoothed magnetic field is reported in units of ng . in the plot at the left",
    "the three different lines correspond to the cases of the three different histories discussed in the previous sections .",
    "these three different histories will imply three different functions @xmath162 with @xmath163 and with , in general @xmath164 . at late times the functions @xmath162 can be approximated as @xmath165 the function @xmath166 arises in the simplest case , i.e. when the universe , after a phase of conventional inflation , passes from a radiation - dominated epoch to the matter stage . in @xmath166",
    "the reheating is assumed to be a sudden process .",
    "the function @xmath167 describes the situation when there is an intermediate stiff phase expanding at a rate slower than radiation .",
    "finally the function @xmath168 arises when there is a prolonged reheating and then the universe is , subsequently , dominated by radiation and matter .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     it is now relevant to remark that while @xmath169 slightly decreases as @xmath19 increases , the opposite is true for @xmath170 .",
    "it is therefore clear that , given this situation , the most constraining wavenumbers are the largest , i.e. the small - scale behaviour of the spectrum is the one that leads to the most stringent bounds .",
    "this consideration has been taken into account in deriving the bounds expressed by figs .",
    "[ b1 ] and [ b2 ] .",
    "in particular , it has been assumed that the diffusion scale is the one roughly associated with the silk wavenumber , i.e. @xmath171 there might be slightly different choices for the diffusion scale .",
    "for instance it has been noticed in the past that the diffusion scale of the magnetic fields should be related with the induced velocity of alfvn waves . in this case",
    "the diffusion length - scale will be slightly smaller than the silk scale by a factor which is essentially proportional , in our notations , to @xmath172 . in this case",
    "the diffusion wavenumber will be given by @xcite : @xmath173 figure [ b3 ] illustrates the situation described by eq .",
    "( [ second ] ) .",
    "it is clear that the patterns of the different thermal histories remain the same .",
    "however , the bound is improved by roughly one order of magnitude .",
    "there are various lessons that can be drawn from the exercise reported in this paper .",
    "the main question we addressed has been the possible influence of slight variations in the thermal history of the universe on the curvature perturbations induced by a magnetic field present for typical scales that are larger than the hubble radius at recombination .",
    "various inflationary mechanisms for the generation of cosmic magnetic field fall in this situation .",
    "it has been found that , indeed , the thermal history of the universe may either suppress or increase the relative weight of magnetized curvature perturbations .",
    "the suppression occurs when , during the dynamical evolution , there is a sort of destructive interference .",
    "this phenomenon takes place , amusingly enough , when there was a phase , in the life of the universe , when the rate of expansion was slower than the one of radiation .",
    "this kind of evolution must occur prior to the onset of big - bang nucleosynthesis and explicit examples have been provided . also the opposite phenomenon can be realized , i.e. a sort of constructive interference when the overall contribution of the magnetized curvature perturbations gets enhanced in comparison with the adiabatic contribution present at the end of inflation .",
    "this situation takes place if the reheating phase is sufficiently prolonged in comparison with the sudden reheating approximation .",
    "these considerations can certainly be developed along different directions .",
    "it is interesting to remark that the nature of the bounds on the magnetic field intensity may change quantitatively and qualitatively .",
    "different thermal histories imply that the constraints on the magnetic field intensities may vary , generally speaking , of one order of magnitude . in the case",
    "when the universe contains after inflation ( but before radiation ) a stiff phase the present value of the smoothed magnetic field must be qualitatively is the intensity of the magnetic field at recombination redshifted to the present epoch .",
    "this field is by no means equal to the present magnetic field .",
    "so the bounds on @xmath150 are , really and truly , bounds on a primordial magnetized background .",
    "the present magnetic field of galaxies and clusters is certainly related to @xmath150 . in the simplest case",
    ", compressional amplification may turn a 0.1 ng field ( coherent over a comoving scale of the order of the mpc ) into the @xmath174 g field observed in galaxies . ]",
    "@xmath175 g while in the context of prolonged reheating it must be as small as @xmath176 g.    the presented considerations are not totally insensitive on the estimate of the diffusive wavenumber .",
    "in particular , it occurs that while experimental data favour a slightly red spectrum of curvature perturbations ( i.e. an adiabatic spectral index slightly smaller than @xmath75 ) , the magnetized contribution is typically nearly scale - invariant but slightly blue . in this situation",
    "the most constraining wavenumbers are the ones close to diffusion scale .",
    "if the diffusivity length - scale is slightly smaller than the silk scale , then the overall bounds on the smoothed magnetic field intensity range , depending on the details of the specific thermal history , from @xmath177 to @xmath178 ng .",
    "it can be discussed if the alfvn velocity should enter the thermal diffusivity scale when the magnetic field is fully inhomogeneous .",
    "indeed alfvn waves are only excited when there is a background magnetic field in the game .",
    "this is not the case when the magnetic field does not break spatial isotropy which the case investigated in the present paper and which is also , in our opinion , the most realistic one ( see the introduction ) . with these caveats , however , it is important to notice that different thermal histories may either relax or improve the bounds on the magnetic field intensity by one order of magnitude .                        ya . zeldovich and i. novikov , _ the structure and evolution of the universe _ , ( chicago university press , chicago , 1971 ) , vol.2 ; ya .",
