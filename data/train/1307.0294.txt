    "the r coronae borealis ( hereafter rcb ) stars are peculiar stars with two main distinguishing characteristics : an extreme hydrogen deficiency ( ranging from factors of @xmath010 - 100 to greater than 10@xmath2 ) and an unpredictable optical variability with relatively rapid declines in brightness ( variations from 2 to 8 magnitudes are usually seen in the v - band ) that can last from a few weeks to many months ( see e.g. , lambert & rao 1994 ; clayton 1996 , 2012 ) .",
    "the h - deficiency seen in rcbs may be explained by two possible scenarios : the double - degenerate ( dd ) and the final flash ( ff ) scenarios .",
    "the resulting h - deficient star is produced either from the merger of a he white dwarf with a c - o white dwarf ( dd scenario ) or from a final post - asymptotic giant branch ( post - agb ) helium flash in the central stars of planetary nebulae ( ff scenario ) .",

    "2011 ; pandey & lambert 2011 ) suggest that the dd scenario may account for the great majority of the rcbs .",
    "indeed , simulations by longland et al .",
    "( 2011 ) show that a  hot \" white dwarf merger may qualitatively explain the chemical abundances observed in rcb stars ( see also staff et al .",
    "2012 for more details about merger simulations and rcbs ) .",
    "another simulation of a hot merger and its subsequent post - merger evolution , nucleosynthesis and mixing ( menon et al . 2012 ) , provides a rather satisfactory account of observed abundances for rcbs .",
    "a rcb s characteristic optical variability is caused by the formation of dust clouds along the line of sight towards the star ( e.g. , forrest , gillett & stein 1972 ; leo et al .",
    "a collection of dust clouds around the rcb through absorption and reradiation of stellar flux provide an infrared excess .",
    "a typical rcb star emits approximately 30% of the stellar flux in the infrared , confirming that they are producers of dust with typical blackbody temperatures ranging from @xmath0400 k to 900 k ( stein et al . 1969 ; feast et al .",

    "cold dust around r crb itself has been recently detected out to 500 @xmath1 m ( clayton et al .",
    "] . however , key questions about the composition of the dust grains around rcbs as well as about where and how ( i.e. , the possible chemical pathways followed in the condensation process ) dust nucleation takes place remain unanswered ( see also garca - hernndez , rao & lambert 2011a ) .",
    "this has been due to the lack of high - quality infrared spectra for all but the two or three infrared - brightest rcb stars .",
    "recently , we have tried to correct this situation by carrying out a _",

    "examination of rcb s infrared spectra and detection of spectroscopic features is a pathway to identification of the circumstellar constituents ( dust grains and large molecules ) .",
    "_ spitzer / irs _ spectra of rcbs are especially valuable because , in contrast to the usual dusty red giants ( and main sequence stars ) , dust in a rcb is formed in a h - poor , he - rich , and usually c - rich environment : a c / he ratio of one per cent by number and a c / o ratio of somewhat greater than one are typical ( asplund et al . 2000 ) .",
    "an understanding of dust formation in both h - rich ( both o - rich and c - rich ) normal stars and h - poor ( c - rich ) environments of the rcbs is desired before one can pronounce that dust formation is understood ; see woitke et al .",

    "the conclusions of our work are given section 6 .",
    "in a future paper we will attempt to model the infrared rcb spectra in order to get information on the physical properties of the dust clouds .",
    "_ spitzer space telescope _ observations of a large number of rcb stars were presented and discussed in paper i. stars were chosen to provide comprehensive coverage of warm rcbs across the chemical composition range observed in rcb stars , to sample the coolest rcbs as well as to complete observations of minority rcbs .",

    "subtraction of the blackbody fluxes from the reddening - corrected infrared fluxes provides the residual spectrum for a rcb .",
    "blackbody continua are essentially a convenient device for specifying the local continuum on which sit the emission features .",
    "interpretation of the spectral structure in the residual spectra is the principal focus of this paper .",
    "the shape of this spectral structure is sensitive to several factors .",
    "first , the correction for interstellar reddening and especially the correction for the interstellar 9.7 @xmath1 m ( and 18 @xmath1 m ) amorphous silicate features affects the long - wavelength shape of the 6 - 10 @xmath1 m dominant feature in the residual spectra .",
    "detailed information on the effect of reddening corrections is given in the next section .",
    "the method of correction assumes that the strength of the amorphous silicate features relative to the broad wavelength - dependent extinction is the same for all lines of sight and independent of e(b - v ) .",
    "second , the shape of the short - wavelength end of the 6 - 10 @xmath1 m dominant feature is affected by the gap in contemporary measurements defining the sed between the short - wavelength limit of the _ spitzer _ observations and the k - band .",
    "flux from the fitted dust blackbody is falling rapidly shortward of about 6 @xmath1 m but a contribution across the 3 - 6 @xmath1 m interval from warmer dust closer to the star is ill - defined for lack of photometry and particularly spectrophotometry across the l - m - n bands at the time of the _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "thirdly , the discernible detail across the residual spectra is dependent - of course - on the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio of the _ spitzer _ spectra .    in paper",
    "i , the interstellar reddening was estimated in a very inhomogeneous way with emphasis given to estimates from various techniques reported in previous papers discussing the individual stars .",
    "thus , it is of great interest to compare these estimates with independent estimates obtained in a very homogeneous way .",
    "such estimates have been provided by tisserand ( 2012 ) from the cobe / dirbe maps ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) . in figure 1",
    ", we compare tisserand s e(b - v ) with those from paper i. the dashed line shows that the two methods give generally very similar values , especially for e(b - v ) less than about 0.5 .",
    "two obvious discrepancies at large e(b - v ) ",
    "fh sct and uv cas  are marked on the figure ( see section 2.1 for more details ) .    in order to reduce the influence of the reddening correction ( section 2.1 ) on the residual spectra ,",
    "we consider first and foremost those rcbs with the smallest e(b - v ) values , say e(b - v ) @xmath13 where e(b - v ) is taken from table 1 .",
    "the octet includes s aps , z umi , wx cra , v1157 sgr , vz sgr , u aqr , v cra , and rs tel .",
    "r crb and ry sgr would be in this group but for the fact that their _ spitzer _",
    "spectra do not extend shortward of 10 @xmath1 m ; we are reluctant to combine _ infrared space observatory _ ( iso ) spectra ( lambert et al . 2001 ) with the _ spitzer _ spectra for these two stars which are so obviously variable in the mid - infrared .",
    "v854 cen and hv 2671 , also low e(b - v ) stars , and dy cen , a star with a higher e(b - v ) , have distinctly different residual spectra , presumably on account of their small h - deficiencies .",
    "their residual spectra were discussed by garca - hernndez , rao & lambert ( 2011b ) .",
    "fortunately , the low - reddening octet samples the different classes ( warm vs cool , majority vs minority ) of rcbs .",
    "thus , it is likely that their residual spectra are representative of the range among rcbs ( see below ) .",
    "construction of residual spectra is illustrated in figure 2 for s aps ( e(b - v ) = 0.05 ) and v1157 sgr ( e(b - v ) = 0.30 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the complete set of residual spectra for the low reddening octet .",
    "the residual spectra are normalized to the maximum value longward of 6 @xmath1 m",
    "( i.e. , the occasional and spurious flux rise at the short wavelength limit seen in some stars is ignored ) and displaced for clarity .",
    "residual spectra for the more - reddened rcbs are shown in figures 4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "v517 oph and su tau are not shown in these figures because their _ spitzer _ spectra do not extend shortward of 10 @xmath1 m ( see section 3 ) . the effect on the residual spectra of reddening uncertainties",
    "is discussed below .",
    "an artefact in the _ spitzer _ spectra should be noted .",
    "some rcb stars ( e.g. , v348 sgr , rz nor , and v cra ) display an emission feature centred at @xmath014.2@xmath140.2 @xmath1 m . although the feature may be attributable to a weak c - c - c bending mode ( hony et al .",
    "2001 ) in carbon grains , we noted that detection of this feature is made using the low - resolution modules , and the feature lies right on the boundary between the sl and ll modules .",
    "in addition , this feature is not obvious in the sh spectra of the few sources ( e.g. , v854 cen ) observed with both low- and high - resolution modules . according to the irs instrument handbook , extreme caution",
    "is recommended in interpreting features at 13.2 - 15 @xmath1 m because there is a known  sl 14 micron teardrop \" , which produces an excess emission that is correlated with the source brightness .",
    "the apparent 14.2 @xmath1 m feature is stronger in the brightest rcbs , and , thus , we conclude that the 14.2 @xmath1 m feature is primarily an artifact related to the  sl 14 micron teardrop \" .",
    "we have undertaken an examination of the effect of the correction for interstellar reddening ( i.e. , varying e(b - v ) ) on the resulting spectral structure ( e.g. , the shape of the 6 - 10 @xmath1 m emission complex ) .",
    "as we mentioned above , our estimates of e(b - v ) values from paper i are compared with the independent estimates by tisserand ( 2012 ) as obtained from cobe / dirbe measurements , for 29 of the 31 stars in table 1 ; tisserand did not give e(b - v ) for machoj181933 and hv 2671 .",
    "for these 29 rcb stars , the mean difference between tisserand s e(b - v ) and our e(b - v ) values is 0.044 with a root mean square deviation of 0.14 .",
    "we thus assume that the error in our e(b - v ) estimates is about 0.1 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we have adopted the reddening curve of chiar & tielens ( 2006 ) of the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ) ( their table 7 ) .",
    "this table provides the extinction from 1.24 @xmath1 m to 30 @xmath1 m but was extended to 38 @xmath1 m , as indicated in paper i. the 9.7 @xmath1 m ( and 18 @xmath1 m ) profile of the silicate feature inferred from observations of the wolf - rayet ( wr ) star wr98a is taken as representative of the local ism .",
    "our adoption of a single profile for the 9.7 and 18 @xmath1 m silicate features might affect the reddening - corrected emission profiles in the @xmath08 - 11 @xmath1 m range because the silicate profile ( as well as other profile changes at 14 @xmath1 m ) varies towards dark clouds , the galactic center and/or other directions .",
    "the strength of the 9.7 @xmath1 m feature also changes appreciably even in the diffuse ism .",
    "this is reflected in the a@xmath15/@xmath16(9.7 ) ratio , which changes from 14.4 to 17.5 even for the calibrating wr stars used by chiar & tielens ( 2006 ) and williams et al .",
    "( 2012 ) give a@xmath15/@xmath16(9.7)=16.6@xmath144.6 for wr stars .",
    "correction for the silicate feature centered at 9.7 @xmath1 m affects the 6 - 10 @xmath1 m profile from about 8.2 to 11.2 @xmath1 m . obviously , increasing the reddening increases the emission for @xmath08 to 11 @xmath1 m .",
    "this is clearly shown in figures 7 and 8 where we display resultant residual spectra obtained for various e(b - v ) values for v3795 sgr and s aps .",
    "in the case of v3795 sgr ( figure 7 ) , our adopted e(b - v ) of 0.79 is preferred because the optical colors are better corrected with this e(b - v ) value .",
    "e(b - v ) values in the range @xmath00.65 - 0.82 may fit reasonably well the _ spitzer _ spectrum , being consistent with our estimated e(b - v ) uncertainty of about 0.1 .",
    "unlike the majority of rcbs , the emission excess for v3795 sgr relative to the fitted blackbody extends to about 15 @xmath1 m but the profile of this extension is effectively independent of the assumed e(b - v ) value .",
    "figure 8 shows the sensitivity of the residual spectra for s aps , a star almost unreddened by the intervening interstellar medium : spectra are shown for e(b - v ) of 0.0 ( as observed ) , 0.2 , and 0.4 . for both stars v3795",
    "sgr and s aps , the dust temperature obtained from blackbody fits to the _ spitzer _ continua are essentially unaffected by the adopted e(b - v ) values over the range investigated . the total flux emitted in the infrared is weakly dependent on e(b - v ) .",
    "the principal effect of the reddening is its effect on the profile of the ( dust ) 6 - 12 @xmath1 m emission feature where correction for the interstellar silicate feature defines the profile between about 8.2 and 11.2 @xmath1 m .",
    "characterization of the emission features in the residual spectra begins with estimating the equivalent width ( eqw ) of the @xmath06 - 10 @xmath1 m dust emission complex seen in all rcb stars in our sample ( see figures 3@xmath176 ) . for this measurement",
    ", the wavelength interval was adjusted for the individual star .",
    "a source of uncertainty arises from the definition of the short - wavelength edge to the broad 6 - 10@xmath1 m emission feature ( see above ) .",
    "the eqws ( table 1 and the column headed eqw@xmath12 ) appear to fall into two groups . in the minor group with large eqw",
    "are the less h - deficient rcbs dy cen , v854 cen , and hv 2671 central stars but their _ spitzer _ spectra are very different ( clayton et al .",
    "the hv 2671 _ spitzer _ spectrum ( with pah - like features ) looks identical to the other less h - deficient rcbs , while the v348 sgr ir spectrum is more similar to that of extremely h - poor rcbs .",
    "thus , based on the _ spitzer _ spectra alone , we consider hv 2671 as a possibly less h - deficient star . ] and also the minority star v3795 sgr and the hot rcb mv sgr .",
    "the major group with eqws less than about 0.6 @xmath1 m are the ` normal ' rcbs .",
    "this apparent separation and the eqw spread within the major group are discussed in the next section .",
    "residual _ spitzer _ spectra display structure within the 6 - 10 @xmath1 m dust emission complex of rcb stars .",
    "in spectra of high s / n ratio ( e.g. , uw cen ) , the complex is seemingly resolvable into emission components at @xmath05.9 , 6.3 , 6.9 , 7.3 , 7.7 , 8.1 , 8.6 , 9.1 , and 9.6 @xmath1 m .",
    "these emission components have similar wavelengths and similar widths ( fwhm ) across the sample ( see below ) . in most rcbs , however , the features are blended and discerning them may not be an easy task , particularly between 7 and 10 @xmath1 m",
    "( i.e. , other than the 6.3 @xmath1 m feature ) .",
    "high s / n residual rcb spectra such as uw cen set the central wavelength of the emission components within the broad 7 - 10 @xmath1 m feature and show that there are several components rather than one broad asymmetrical band .",
    "indeed , by overlapping most of the residual rcb spectra on each other , common emission bumps at @xmath06.3 , 6.9 , 7.3 , 7.7 , 8.1 , and 8.6 @xmath1 m are usually found .",
    "thus , we were encouraged to carry out a multi - gaussian fit using a deblending routine written for supermongo .",
    "a condition of the fit was that gaussians were introduced at wavelengths of 5.9 , 6.3 , 7.3 , 7.8 , 8.1 , 8.6 , 9.1 , and 9.6 @xmath1 m with small adjustments allowed for the central wavelengths and fwhms .",
    "parameters from the multi - gaussian fits ( central wavelength , fwhm , and integrated flux ) are listed in table 2 for the low - reddening octet and in table 3 for the more reddened stars including the three least h - deficient rcbs .",
    "examples of fits are shown in figure 9 for uw cen and v348 sgr , a warm and a hot rcb , respectively .",
    "in general , the fwhm of components in the 7 - 14 @xmath1 m interval are considerably greater than the instrumental width which according to the _ spitzer _ manual is two pixels or 0.12 @xmath1 m the 5.9 @xmath1 m component has a fwhm @xmath0 0.2 @xmath1 m for many stars but definition of this component is greatly influenced by the assumed wien tail of the dust continuum emission and the short wavelength termination of the _ spitzer _ spectrum .    finally , we also carried out the multi - gaussian fits on the residual _ spitzer _",
    "spectra of the three hydrogen deficient pne - a 78 , a 30 , and iras 1833 - 2357 - studied here for comparison .",
    "the corresponding residual spectra were obtained by subtracting the dust continuum emission , which was represented by 5-order polynomials fitted at spectral locations free from any dust or gas feature .",
    "interestingly , all three pne show weak infrared features at 6.4 , 7.3 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m only ( see section 4 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the parameters ( central wavelength , fwhm , and integrated flux ) of the three ir emission features in h - poor pne are listed at the bottom of table 3 .",
    "in both the observed and the dereddened spectra , all stars show emission features superimposed on the smooth continuum which is fitted with one , two , and , in rare cases , three blackbody continua .",
    "stars may be sorted into two groups .",
    "the first group with large eqws for the emission features include three stars ( dy cen , v854 cen , and hv 2671 ) known ( presumed in the case of hv 2671 , see above ) to possess relatively large amounts of hydrogen .",

    "second , the feature s shape shortward of 6 microns is sensitive to the wien tail of the fitted warmer dusty blackbody and , more generally , to the lack of contemporaneous spectral information shortward of the short - wavelength limit of the _ spitzer _ spectra .    in order to illustrate the quasi - continuous distribution of shapes for the 6 - 10 @xmath1 m emission feature with minimal sensitivity to the adopted reddening , we concentrate first on the eight rcb stars in the second group with the least reddening , i.e. , with adopted values of e(b - v)@xmath180.3 .",

    "a naive expectation would be that the c - h deformation band fluxes relative to that of the c - c stretch at 6.3 @xmath1 m should correlate with the spectroscopically measured h abundance ( asplund et al . 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , one might compare h abundances for class @xmath20 stars and class @xmath21 stars where the latter have the weaker 6.9 - 7.3@xmath1 m component .",
    "one difficulty is that h abundances are available for just two of the four @xmath21 stars and for four of the seven @xmath20 stars . for the @xmath20 stars , the logarithmic h abundances are @xmath264.1 , 4.8 , 6.1 , and 6.5 . for the @xmath21 pair ,",

    "moreover , relative fluxes for the two c - h deformation bands within the 6.9 - 7.3@xmath1 m feature are uncorrelated ; the flux ratio of the 7.3 @xmath1 m band to the 6.9 @xmath1 m band varies over a factor of 20 for the six stars with h abundances between 5 and 6.5 .",
    "an interpretation of this result may be that the 7.3 @xmath1 m band is not entirely due to c - h deformation .",
    "this conclusion may extend to the 6.9 @xmath1 m band .",
    "there is tentative evidence that the relative strength of the 6.9 - 7.3 @xmath1 m feature in rcbs may be anticorrelated with the silicon abundance .",
