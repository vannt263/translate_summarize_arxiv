    "stock markets are recently triggering a growing interest in the physicists community .",
    "the objective of this attention is to understand the underlying dynamics which rules the companies stock prices . in particular",
    ", it would be useful to find , inside a given stock market index , groups of companies sharing similar temporal behavior . to this purpose ,",
    "a clustering approach to the problem may represent a good strategy .",
    "clustering deals with the partitioning of a set of _ n _ elements into _ k _ clusters , based on a suitable ( and not unique ) similarity criterion @xcite .",
    "non - parametric methods represent the optimal strategy when a hierarchical structure , rather than a fixed partition , of the data should be obtained : this is the case with stock index dynamics and portfolio optimization strategies @xcite .",
    "examples of non - parametric methods are the _ linkage _ ( _ agglomerative _ and _ divisive _ ) algorithms @xcite , whose output is a _ dendrogram _ displaying the full hierarchy of the clustering solutions at different scales .",
    "the agglomerative approaches merge , at each step , the two clusters with the smallest _ distance _ , starting from clusters containing only one element . here",
    "we use a non - parametric clustering approach , named chaotic map clustering ( cmc ) @xcite , which relies on the synchronization properties of a chaotic map system @xcite to obtain a hierarchy of classes without any assumptions on the underlying structure of the data .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows : in section [ pcmc ] we give a brief review of the chaotic map algorithm , suitably modified for pairwise clustering of financial times series .",
    "section [ fts ] deals with the analysis of the companies stock prices .",
    "finally , some conclusions are drawn in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "chaotic map clustering has been introduced as a central algorithm , where the elements to cluster are embedded in a _ d_-dimensional feature space .",
    "in such a picture , the data - points are viewed as sites of a grid , hosting a chaotic map dynamics : the map variables @xmath0 $ ] , @xmath1 , are assigned to each site of the lattice , and short - range interactions between neighboring maps are introduced as exponential decreasing function of the site distance . in the stationary regime ,",
    "clusters of synchronized maps appear , corresponding to high density regions in the original data space .",
    "the mutual information between maps is used both as a similarity index for building the clusters , and a scale parameter for reconstructing the hierarchical tree .",
    "+ it should be remarked that a pairwise version of the algorithm can be easily implemented if an @xmath2 matrix of similarities ( not necessarily distances in the mathematical sense ) is provided instead of the feature vectors for all data . + as far as one deals with clustering temporal patterns @xmath3 , the correlation coefficients @xmath4 $ ] seem to be a natural measure of similarity : @xmath5 where the temporal averages are computed over the time series length . in @xcite ,",
    "the correlation coefficients between financial time series are used as entries into the super - paramagnetic clustering ( spc ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the spc algorithm shares the same philosophy of the cmc approach , the physical system used to partition the data being an inhomogeneous ferromagnetic model : potts spin @xmath6 are assigned , instead of map variables , to each data - point and short - range interactions between neighboring sites are introduced .",
    "the spin - spin correlation function replaces the mutual information as similarity index for clustering data . in the super - paramagnetic regime ,",
    "domains of aligned spins appear , corresponding to the classes present in the data .",
    "+ kullmann et al .",
    "generalize the spc to the case of anti - ferromagnetic couplings by introducing the following spin - spin strength as a function of the correlation coefficients @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath8^{n}\\big\\ } \\big)~ , \\label{j}\\ ] ] where the sign function maps positive / negative correlations between companies stock prices into positive / negative interactions between potts spins , _",
    "n _ is an even positive integer tuning the shape of the interaction function ( whose value should be chosen so that a stable non - trivial partition can be obtained inside the hierarchical solution ) , and _ a _ is the average of the largest correlation coefficients for each sequence @xcite : @xmath9    we shall try to follow a similar strategy in our cmc approach .",
    "we first observe that , in order to implement a chaotic map dynamics , the correlation coefficients between financial time series should be mapped into positive interactions between maps , ranging in [ @xmath10 .",
    "hence , we are naturally led to adopt the couplings ( [ j ] ) for @xmath11 , while setting @xmath12 for @xmath13 . in this way",
    ", we build up a partially coupled map lattice with exponential increasing interactions between positively correlated companies . in the case of randomly coupled systems , although exact synchronization and formation of clusters of identical dynamical states are not found as in the globally coupled case @xcite , yet , clusters of _ almost _ synchronized maps are still observed , even for a significant fraction ( up to @xmath14 ) of lacking connections @xcite . by retaining the interactions only between positively correlated time series",
    ", we bias the formation of _ almost _ synchronized maps to correspond to groups of companies sharing the same temporal behavior , while anti - correlated companies are likely to belong to different clusters .",
    "the chaotic map dynamics reads @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the logistic map , @xmath17 is a normalization factor , and @xmath18 denotes the evolution time of the chaotic map system ( not to be confused with the real time _",
    "t _ of the financial series ) .",
    "a detailed description of the above mentioned dynamics for clustering purposes is described elsewhere @xcite ; roughly speaking , after a certain equilibration time , the dynamics ( [ x ] ) yields a partition of the maps @xmath19 into synchronized clusters , that remain stable during the remaining part of the @xmath18-evolution .",
    "applications of the cmc algorithm cover a number of fields , such as buried land - mines detection by dynamic infrared imaging @xcite , human evolution study with mitochondrial _ dna _",
    "sequences @xcite , and diagnosis of pathological electroencephalographic patterns affected by huntington s disease @xcite .",
    "here we apply the cmc algorithm to cluster the companies of the dow jones ( dj ) market index , including @xmath20 stocks , whose names are listed in appendix [ appendix ] , together with the identifying tickers and the related industrial branches .",
    "we first analyze one - year time periods , from 1998 to 2002 .",
    "for each year , the correlation coefficients ( [ corr ] ) are computed for the logarithmic daily price variation time series @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the closure price of stock _",
    "i _ at day _ t_. + it should be remarked that , for each investigated period , the number of pairs of anti - correlated companies @xmath23 is very small in comparison with the total number of pairs @xmath24 , and the mean value of the anticorrelations @xmath25 is almost zero ( see table 1 ) . at this point it should be stressed that the very fact that all stocks are correlated , and practically lack any anticorrelation , make not easy any possible clustering procedure . + as a result of the processing , a dendrogram displays the hierarchical structure of the clusters at different values of the mutual information @xmath26 defined as follows :    * extract a bitwise sequence @xmath27 from each map @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 * evaluate the probability @xmath30 as the number of times the state @xmath31 occurs along the sequence @xmath31 , normalized to the sequence length ; in a similar way , @xmath32 is the frequency of simultaneous occurrence of the states @xmath33 along the sequences @xmath31 and @xmath34 ; * compute the string entropy @xmath35 and the joint entropy @xmath36 as @xmath37 @xmath38 * the mutual information is then given by : @xmath39 ;    the mutual information is a measure of the correlations between maps @xcite , ranging between @xmath40 , for maps evolving independently , and @xmath41 , for exactly synchronized maps . for this reason , @xmath26 can be appropriately adopted as a similarity index for clustering the companies : by cutting the dendrogram at a certain level @xmath42 $ ] , the clusters thus obtained are made up of companies whose associated maps are characterized by @xmath43 . the level _",
    "i _ can be suitably chosen by relying on a certain stability criterion of the clustering solution . to this purpose",
    ", the cluster entropy @xmath44 @xcite can be used to select the most stable partition among the whole hierarchy yielded by the algorithm , by looking for a plateau in the widest possible range of _ i _ values : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the fraction of elements belonging to cluster _ k _ , and @xmath47 is the number of clusters found at level _",
    "i_. + this model depends on one parameter , the positive even integer number _",
    "n _ , which tunes the range of the interactions ( [ j ] ) . for each period , the optimal value of the parameter _",
    "n _ should be chosen according to the stability criterion of the entropy ( [ clust - ent ] ) , at different cluster partitions .",
    "as an example , we consider the processing relative to the year 1999 : figure 1 displays the entropy _ s _ in the plane spanned by _ i _ ( mutual information ) and _ n _ , with @xmath48 .",
    "we choose @xmath49 to be the optimal value , by looking for the widest range of constant values of _ s _ , along the _ i_-direction ( @xmath50 ) . +",
    "once this parameter has been adjusted , the full hierarchy of clusters can be displayed by a dendrogram : figure 2 shows the result obtained for the year 1999 .",
    "the dendrogram has been cut in the region of stable partitions at @xmath51 . for low value of mutual information ,",
    "all pairs of companies are linked together in one single cluster , which splits into two big clusters at @xmath52 : on one side , we clearly recognize companies dealing mainly with capital goods ( ba , cat , hon ) and basic materials ( aa , dd , ip ) . on the other side , we find a cluster of strongly correlated companies represented by the branch marked by a star . this cluster , which gradually breaks as the mutual information approaches its maximum value @xmath53 , groups together different industrial branches : financial ( c , axp , jpm ) , services ( dis , hd , mcd , sbc , t , wmt ) , healthcare ( jnj , mrk ) , conglomerates ( ge , utx ) , consumer non - cyclical ( gm , ko , mo , pg ) . besides this cluster , it should be remarked the formation of technological cores ( ibm and hpq , intc and msft ) . +",

    "the choice of the period length for computing the correlation coefficients should be related to the flexibility of the portfolio . from this point of view , an analysis covering the whole 5-year period should be based on more stable correlation coefficients , thus leading to more stable partitions ( i.e. , less hazardous investment ) , at the cost of a less flexible portfolio . in figure [ dendro - all ] , we report the full hierarchy of clusters found from the whole 5-year length time period ( @xmath66 ) .",

    "the correlation coefficients between financial time series have been used as similarity measures to cluster the temporal patterns . once the coupling interactions between maps are taken to be functions of this feature , the dynamics of such a system leads to the formation of clusters of companies that can often be identified as different industrial branches .",
