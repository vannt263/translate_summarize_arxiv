    "in this paper we present the coding theorems for compound and averaged channels with classical input and quantum output ( cq - channels ) .",
    "the result nicely supplements recent results of datta and dorlas @xcite where they considered finite weighted sums of memoryless quantum channels and determined their classical capacity .",
    "this is one of the basic examples of channels with long - term memory .",
    "this is obviously equivalent to the determination of the classical capacity for the associated compound channel consisting of finitely many channels , since for finite sums we can easily bound the error probabilities of the individual memoryless branches by the error probability of the averaged channel and vice versa .",
    "unfortunately , the beautiful method of proof in @xcite does not apply when the number of channels is infinite .",
    "+ roughly , the interest in compound channels is motivated by the fact that in many situations we have only a limited knowledge about the channel which is used for the transmission of information . in the compound setting we know",
    "merely that the memoryless cq - channel which is in use belongs to some given finite or infinite set of memoryless cq - channels which is a priori known to the sender and receiver .",
    "their goal is to construct coding - decoding strategies that work well for the whole set of channels simultaneously .",
    "the situation is comparable with the universal source coding scenario considered in @xcite by jozsa and m. , p. , and r. horodecki .",
    "averaged cq - channels are close relatives of compound channels , the difference being that in this situation the communicating parties have access to an additional a priori probability distribution governing the appearance of the particular member of the compound channel .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section [ rev - class - comp ] we give a rapid overview of the classical theory of compound channels . whereas section [ def - cq - comp ] is devoted to the notion of compound cq - channels and the definition of the capacity for this class of channels .",
    "the subsequent section [ universal - approximation ] contains the first pillar of our argument .",
    "namely , we construct , using an idea going back to nagaoka , a universal classical approximation of the quantum relative entropy for classes of uncorrelated quantum states .",
    "the central section [ compound ] starts with a relation between a minimization procedure arising in universal hypothesis testing and the minimization process required for the determination of the capacity of compound cq - channels which is based on donald s inequality ( cf .",
    "lemmata [ donald ] and [ equality-2 ] )",
    ". then we proceed with the direct and the ( strong ) converse part of the coding theorem for compound cq - channels . as a by - product we can prove in section [ av - channel ] the coding theorem and the weak converse for arbitrary averaged cq - channels with memoryless branches .",
    "this extends , in part , the results of ahlswede @xcite to the cq - situation .",
    "moreover , the results of datta and dorlas @xcite are generalized to averages of memoryless cq - channels with respect to arbitrary probability measures , provided the set of channels has some appropriate measurable structure .",
    "we will assume tacitly throughout the paper that all hilbert spaces are over the field @xmath0 .",
    "the identity operator acting on a hilbert space @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath2 or simply by @xmath3 if it is clear from the context which hilbert space is under consideration .",
    "the set of density operators acting on the finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath4 and the set of probability distributions on a finite set @xmath5 will be abbreviated by @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath5 .",
    "the projection onto the range of a density operator @xmath8 , @xmath9 , is called the support of @xmath10 and we dedicate the notation @xmath11 to it .",
    "+ the relative entropy of the state ( i.e. density operator ) @xmath10 with respect to the state @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for the trace and @xmath15 is the binary logarithm .",
    "the classical analog of the relative entropy known as kullback - leibler distance is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "the relation @xmath18 means that @xmath19 for some @xmath20 implies @xmath21 or , equivalently , that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",

    "the shannon entropy of @xmath26 , @xmath27 , is given by @xmath28 .",
    "+ the @xmath29-fold cartesian product of a finite set @xmath5 with itself is denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "we set @xmath31 for sequences @xmath32 .",
    "+ notation we use for the logarithms is as follows : @xmath33 is the logarithm to the base @xmath34 and @xmath15 is understood as @xmath35 .",
    "the basic classical theory of compound channels was developed independently by blackwell , breiman , thomasian @xcite and wolfowitz @xcite .",
    "blackwell , breiman and thomasian proved the coding theorem with the weak converse .",
    "wolfowitz , on the other hand , obtained the coding theorem with the strong converse for the maximum error criterion by an entirely different method of proof .",
    "we recall at this place briefly the capacity formula just to emphasize the similarity to the capacity formula ( [ quant - compound - capacity ] ) for the cq - case .",
    "+ for an arbitrary set @xmath36 and finite sets @xmath5 , @xmath37 we consider the family of discrete channels @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",

    "a similar definition of the @xmath50-codes can be given simply by replacing the maximum error criterion by the average one .",
    "thus the goal is to find reliable codes which work well for all discrete memoryless channels indexed by the set @xmath36 .",
    "+ the work @xcite , @xcite can be summarized as follows : the weak capacity of the compound channel @xmath36 with respect to both the maximum and average error criteria is given by @xmath51 where @xmath6 denotes the set of probability distributions on @xmath5 and @xmath52 is the mutual information of the channel @xmath53 with respect to the input distribution @xmath54 .",
    "wolfowitz has shown that the rhs of ( [ class - compound - capacity ] ) is the strong capacity with respect to the maximum error criterion .",
    "ahlswede gives an example in @xcite that demonstrates that , surprisingly , the strong converse need not hold for compound channels if the average probability of error is used in the definition of the capacity .",
    "we consider here a set of cq - channels @xmath55 , @xmath39 , for an arbitrary set @xmath36 where @xmath5 is a finite set and @xmath1 is a finite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the @xmath29-th memoryless extension of the cq - channel @xmath53 is given by @xmath56 for @xmath57 . + the _ compound cq - channel _ is given by the family @xmath58 .",
    "we will write simply @xmath36 for the compound cq - channel .",
    "+ an @xmath29-_code _ , @xmath59 , for the compound cq - channel @xmath36 is a family @xmath60 consisting of sequences @xmath61 and positive semi - definite operators @xmath62 such that @xmath63 .",
    "the number @xmath64 is called the _ size _ of the code . + a code @xmath65 is called a @xmath42-code for the compound cq - channel @xmath36 if the size of @xmath65 is @xmath64 , @xmath61 and if @xmath66 with an analog definition of an @xmath67-code w.r.t average error probability criterion , i.e. we replace @xmath68 by @xmath69 in the definition . +",
    "thus an @xmath42-code for the compound channel @xmath36 ensures that the maximal error probability for all channels of class @xmath36 is bounded from above by @xmath70 .",
    "a more intuitive description of the compound channel is that the sender and receiver actually do nt know which channel from the set @xmath36 is used during the transmission of the @xmath29-block .",
    "their prior knowledge is merely that the channel is memoryless and belongs to the set @xmath36 .",
