    "functions of bounded variation ( bv functions ) on abstract wiener spaces were first studied in @xcite for their applications in stochastic analysis , but recently bv functions on infinite dimensional spaces have attracted attention for a variety of reasons . in this paper , we newly introduce the space @xmath0 of functions of locally bounded variation ( local bv functions ) on the abstract wiener space @xmath1 . needless to say , there could be several ways of localizing the concept of bounded variation . in this article",
