    "a comprehensive understanding of the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) equation of state is of crucial importance for a better understanding of the matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions  @xcite , as well as the candidates for dark matter in cosmology  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of qcd thermodynamics utilizing weakly - coupled quantum field theory has a long history @xcite .",
    "the perturbative pressure is known up to order @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the strong coupling constant @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a straightforward application of perturbation theory is of limited use since the weak - coupling expansion does not converge unless the temperature is extraordinarily high . comparing the magnitude of low - order contributions to the qcd free energy with three quark flavors ( @xmath2 )",
    ", one finds that the @xmath3 contribution is smaller than the @xmath4 contribution only for @xmath5 or @xmath6 , which corresponds to a temperature of @xmath7gev @xmath8 , with @xmath9  mev being the qcd pseudo - critical temperature .",
    "the poor convergence of the weak - coupling expansion of thermodynamic functions stems from the fact that at high temperature the classical solution is not well - described by massless degrees of freedom , and is instead better described by massive quasiparticles with non - trivial dispersion relations and interactions .",
    "one way to deal with the problem is to use an effective field theory framework in which one treats hard modes using standard four - dimensional qcd and soft modes using a dimensionally reduced three - dimensional su(3 ) plus adjoint higgs model @xcite , but treating the soft sector non - perturbatively by not expanding the soft contributions in powers of the coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the technique of treating the soft sector non - perturbatively is ubiquitous and there exist several ways of systematically reorganizing the perturbative series at finite temperature which rely on improved treatment of the soft sector ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "such treatments are based on a quasiparticle picture in which one performs a loop expansion around an ideal gas of massive quasiparticles , rather than an ideal gas of massless particles .    in this paper we present results for the finite - temperature and density next - to - next - to - leading - order ( nnlo ) qcd pressure and diagonal quark susceptibilities obtained using the hard - thermal - loop perturbation theory ( htlpt ) reorganization  @xcite of finite temperature / density qcd .",
    "this work extends previous nnlo work at zero chemical potential @xcite and previous leading - order ( lo ) @xcite and next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) work at finite chemical potential @xcite to nnlo . for our results we present",
    "( i ) comparisons of the pressure scaled by the ideal pressure to available lattice data at zero and finite chemical potential and ( ii ) comparisons of the extracted second- and fourth - order diagonal quark number susceptibilities to available lattice data .",
    "we present the explicit analytic expression for the nnlo htlpt thermodynamic potential in an appendix .",
    "the minkowski space lagrangian density for an @xmath10 yang - mills theory with @xmath11 massless fermions is @xmath12 + i \\bar\\psi \\gamma^\\mu d_\\mu \\psi \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\hspace{1.5 cm }   + { \\cal l}_{\\rm gf } + { \\cal l}_{\\rm gh } + \\delta{\\cal l}_{\\rm qcd}\\ ; , \\label{l - qed}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the field strength is @xmath13 $ ] and the covariant derivative is @xmath14 .",
    "@xmath15 contains the counterterms necessary to cancel ultraviolet divergences in perturbative calculations .",
    "the ghost term @xmath16 depends on the gauge - fixing term @xmath17 . in this paper",
    "we work in general covariant gauge where @xmath18 $ ] with @xmath19 being the gauge - fixing parameter .    as mentioned previously , htlpt is a reorganization of the perturbation series for thermal qcd .",
    "the lagrangian density is written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 contains the additional counterterms necessary to cancel the ultraviolet divergences introduced by htlpt .",
    "htlpt is gauge invariant order - by - order in the dressed - loop expansion and consequently , the results obtained are independent of the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath19 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gauge - fixing parameter independence in general coulomb and covariant gauges was explicitly demonstrated .",
    "we use @xmath22 dimensional regularization with a renormalization scale @xmath23 introduced to regularize infrared and ultraviolet divergences .",
    "the htl improvement term is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a light - like four - vector and @xmath26 represents an average over the directions specified by the three - dimensional unit vector @xmath27 .",
    "the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be identified with the debye screening mass and the fermion thermal mass in the weak coupling limit , however , in htlpt they are treated as free parameters to be fixed at the end of the calculation .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is the formal expansion parameter : htlpt is defined as an expansion in powers of @xmath30 around @xmath31 , followed by taking @xmath32 .",
    "this expansion systematically generates dressed propagators and vertices with expansions to order @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 corresponding to lo , nlo , and nnlo , respectively .    through inclusion of the htl improvement term ( [ l - htl ] )",
    ", htlpt systematically shifts the perturbative expansion from being around an ideal gas of massless particles , which is the physical picture of the naive weak - coupling expansion , to being around a gas of massive quasiparticles .",
    "since the loop expansion is an expansion around the classical extremum of the action , this shift incorporates the classical physics of the high temperature quark gluon plasma , i.e. debye screening and landau damping , from the outset and loop corrections correspond to true quantum and thermal corrections to the classical high temperature limit .",
    "in addition , new vertices which account for in - medium htl interactions are self - consistently generated in the htlpt framework .",
    "there is no general proof that the htlpt expansion is renormalizable and , as a result , the general structure of the ultraviolet divergences is unknown .",
    "however , in practice it has been explicitly demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite that it is possible to renormalize the htlpt thermodynamic potential using only a vacuum counterterm , a debye mass counterterm , a fermion mass counterterm , and a coupling constant counterterm . through @xmath36",
    "the htlpt counterterms necessary to renormalize the thermodynamic potential are @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 .    in practice , in addition to the @xmath30 expansion , it is also necessary to make a taylor expansion in the mass parameters scaled by the temperature , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , in order to obtain analytically tractable sum - integrals .",
    "otherwise , one would have to resort to numerical evaluation and regularization of difficult multi - dimensional sum - integrals .",
    "an added benefit of this procedure is that the final result obtained at nnlo is completely analytic . in order to truncate the series in @xmath41 and @xmath42 one treats these quantities as being @xmath43 at leading order , keeping all terms that naively contribute to the thermodynamic potential through @xmath44 . in practice ,",
    "such an truncated expansion works well @xcite and the radius of convergence of the scaled mass expansion seems to be quite large , giving us confidence in this approximate treatment of the necessary sum - integrals .",
    "we present the full analytic expression for the nnlo htlpt result in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nnloresult ] ) in the appendix . in this section",
    "we collect plots of the results and compare them to lattice data .",
    "for all results we use the braaten - nieto mass prescription for the gluon debye mass specified in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bnmass ] ) and choose @xmath45 since this is the self - consistent solution to the quark gap equation at nnlo ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of gluon and quark mass prescriptions within nnlo htlpt ) . for the strong coupling constant @xmath46",
    ", we use one - loop running  @xcite with @xmath47 mev , which for @xmath2 gives @xmath48  @xcite which is the self - consistent running obtained in nnlo htlpt .",

    "[ fig : dp ] the lattice data from the wuppertal - budapest ( wb ) is computed up to @xmath63 , whereas the htlpt result includes all orders in @xmath64 . as can be seen from this figure ,",
    "the nnlo htlpt result is quite close to the result obtained in the stefan - boltzmann limit .",
    "the nnlo htlpt result , however , is in better agreement with the available lattice data .",
    "note that the small correction in going from the stefan - boltzmann limit to nnlo htlpt indicates that the fermionic sector is , to good approximation , weakly coupled for @xmath65 .    as a more sensitive measure of the dependence of the pressure on the chemical potential",
    ", one can calculate the diagonal quark number susceptibilities ( qns ) .",

    "we begin by noting that since the nnlo htlpt result ( [ eq : nnloresult ] ) was obtained assuming equal chemical potentials for @xmath11 massless quark flavors ( @xmath71 and @xmath72 ) , derivatives of the result with respect to @xmath73 are related to the diagonal baryon number susceptibility .    in figs .",

    "@xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "we have indicated the action used in each case in the legend and sets without a value of @xmath74 specified are continuum - extrapolated results .",
    "we note that for @xmath75 the largest @xmath74 results are in quite good agreement with the continuum - extrapolated results .",
    "additionally , we note that the htlpt bands shown are predominantly due to the variation of the central scales to one half of their central values .            for the second - order susceptibility",
    ", we compare with lattice results for both single flavor @xmath76 and baryon number susceptibilities ( b ) . for the fourth - order susceptibility",
    ", we show only lattice results for the fourth - order baryon number susceptibility .",
    "it is expected that the second - order single flavor and baryon number susceptibilities differ only at the percent level because of small off - diagonal contributions ; however , the fourth - order single flavor and baryon number susceptibilities are expected to differ by approximately @xmath77 near the phase transition  @xcite .    as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : qns2 ] , the agreement between nnlo htlpt and lattice data for the second - order baryon - number susceptibility is quite reasonable at high temperatures .",
    "in addition , we note that in the case of the second - order susceptibility , the lo @xcite and nlo @xcite htlpt predictions are close to the nnlo result shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qns2 ] , indicating that this quantity converges nicely in htlpt .",
    "the fourth - order susceptibility , however , shows a significant change in going from lo to nlo to nnlo ( see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite for the lo and nlo results ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the fourth - order susceptibility is very sensitive to over - counting which occurs in low order htlpt . at nnlo",
    "this over - counting is fixed through order @xmath78 if the result is perturbatively expanded . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : qns4 ] , the nnlo htlpt result seems to be in reasonable agreement with the lattice measurements of @xmath79 .",
    "in this paper we presented results for the nnlo htlpt qcd pressure with an arbitrary number of colors and quark flavors .",
    "the final result is completely analytic and when its predictions are compared with available lattice data , one finds reasonable agreement for the pressure , second- , and fourth - order diagonal susceptibilities down to temperatures on the order of @xmath80 .",
    "the analytic result obtained is gauge - invariant and , besides the choice of the renormalization scales @xmath49 and @xmath50 , does not contain any free fit parameters .",
    "details concerning the calculation of the nnlo results listed in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nnloresult ] ) and ( [ eq : bnmass ] ) will be presented elsewhere @xcite . in closing",
    ", we note that the application of hard thermal loops in the heavy ion phenomenology is ubiquitous and the fact that htlpt is able to reproduce the finite temperature and chemical potential thermodynamic functions with reasonable accuracy offers some hope that the application of this method to the computation of other processes / quantities is warranted .",
