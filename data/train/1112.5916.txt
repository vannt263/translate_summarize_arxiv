    "the theory of many - fermion systems is of obvious importance because of its ubiquitous applications in condensed - matter physics .",
    "it is also a very hard problem , due to the difficulty of dealing with a macroscopic number of electrons which , in many materials , interact strongly enough to preclude treating the interactions as weak perturbations of noninteracting electrons . historically , there have been two main approaches to the problem .",
    "landau s fermi - liquid theory,@xcite although not perturbative , is phenomenological and self - contained in nature , and often a more microscopic approach is desirable , especially for investigations of the limitation of fermi - liquid theory .",
    "many - body diagrammatic techniques,@xcite on the other hand , are limited by their inherently perturbative approach .",
    "furthermore , it is neither feasible nor desirable to study all aspects of a microscopic model , except in some special cases . for many important applications it suffices to keep only the low - lying excitations or soft modes of the system , which govern the behavior at long times and large distances .",
    "the most obvious examples of such applications are phase transitions , but there also are many qualitative properties of entire phases that depend on the soft modes only",
    ". these observables also have the attractive property of being universal in the sense that they depend only on basic symmetry properties of the system , and not on any microscopic details .",
    "consider , for instance , a heisenberg ferromagnet .",
    "the critical behavior at the curie point , i.e. , the phase transition from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic phase , is entirely governed by soft modes,@xcite but so is the divergence of the longitudinal susceptibility everywhere in the ordered phase.@xcite to describe and understand either phenomenon it therefore suffices to consider an effective theory that takes into account only the relevant soft modes . in the case of the heisenberg ferromagnet at temperatures",
    "@xmath0 , either a classical @xmath1 @xmath2-theory or an @xmath1 nonlinear sigma model provides a suitable effective theory.@xcite such a theory can sometimes be constructed based on symmetry considerations only , but it often is desirable , and leads to greater physical insight , to start with a microscopic description and derive the effective theory by integrating out all non - essential degrees of freedom in some simple approximation that respects the crucial symmetries . the resulting `` hydrodynamic '' , i.e. , long - wavelength and low - frequency , description of any system of interest is complementary to , and serves a very different purpose than , for instance , a first - principles approach that aims at a description at atomic length and energy scales . in order to obtain a",
    "well - behaved effective theory , care must be taken to keep all soft modes of interest _ and _ all other soft modes that couple to them .",
    "integrating out soft modes leads to long - ranged effective interactions between the remaining degrees of freedom , and hence to non - local effective field theories that can be hard to handle technically .    for noninteracting disordered electrons such an effective - theory approach",
    "was pioneered by wegner.@xcite guided by an analogy with classical ferromagnets he constructed a matrix nonlinear sigma model capable of describing the instability of a ( disordered ) fermi - liquid phase against the formation of an anderson insulator , and allowed for the determination of the critical behavior at the anderson transition in terms of an @xmath3-expansion about the lower critical dimension for this problem , @xmath4 .",
    "wegner s original formulation was expanded upon by various authors,@xcite and eventually his sigma model was generalized to interacting disordered electrons.@xcite this theory and its generalizations have been extensively used to describe the anderson - mott metal - insulator transition.@xcite these theories are fundamentally based on diffusive soft modes , and do not allow for the clean limit to be taken .",
    "this led to the strange situation where a successful effective soft - mode theory was available for disordered electrons , but not for clean ones , although one might think that the latter poses a simpler problem.@xcite this last conclusion is fallacious , however , mostly because the number of soft modes is much larger in clean electron systems than in disordered ones .",
    "this was noted in ref .",
    ", whose main objective was to provide a thorough derivation of finkelstein s generalized nonlinear sigma model for disordered systems . while this theory did allow for the clean limit to be taken , the resulting field theory had non - local vertices and did not offer any obvious way to obtain a description as useful as the nonlinear sigma model for the disordered case .",
    "another effective field theory for clean electrons was developed in ref .  .",
    "this theory is technically based on a supersymmetric matrix formulation and aims to incorporate and unify various other approaches that discuss the validity and limitations of landau fermi - liquid theory.@xcite it introduces bosonic degrees of freedom and integrates out the fermions , as did ref .",
    ", in contrast to shankar s derivation of fermi - liquid theory that applied renormalization - group ( rg ) techniques to a fermionic field theory.@xcite the theory of ref .   has recently been refined@xcite and formulated both in a version that is formally exact and may be better suitable for numerical work than standard monte - carlo techniques,@xcite and as an effective field theory for low - lying excitations.@xcite the latter was used for an analysis of the low - temperature specific heat in two - dimensional systems .    in the present paper",
    "we take a different approach to this problem .",
    "it is similar in spirit to refs .  , but rather different technically .",
    "our physical motivation is the desirability of a broadly useful effective theory that is capable of describing widely different phenomena such as ferromagnetic ordering in non - s - wave angular momentum channels,@xcite quantum ferrimagnetic order , which has received little attention so far , a possible breakdown of fermi - liquid theory due to a vanishing quasi - particle weight,@xcite and , in addition , novel universal aspects of the fermi - liquid phase.@xcite we are interested in a local field theory that is not perturbative with respect to the electron - electron interaction , but rather can be controlled by means of a systematic loop expansion .",
    "this will provide a basis for an application of rg techniques that allow for a resummation of the expansion in powers of the loop parameter , and thus allow to go beyond perturbation theory in a controlled fashion .",
    "this not possible within the framework of traditional perturbation theory,@xcite which provides no information about the structure of the renormalized theory .",
    "technically , the theory we will develop is based on a generalization of ref .  .",
    "the reason for the non - locality of the latter was its restriction to density or s - wave ( @xmath5 ) modes , with soft modes in higher angular - momentum channels being effectively integrated out . formulating the theory in terms of phase - space variables allows one to keep the soft modes in all angular - momentum channels .",
    "this leads both to a local theory and allows for natural description of order in @xmath6 channels .",
    "integrating out the massive modes in a tree approximation leads to an effective action that explicitly keeps all of the soft modes .",
    "its structure is different from that of the generalized nonlinear sigma model for the disordered case .",
    "it can be constructed to any desired order in the soft degrees of freedom , which in turn allows to perform a loop expansion to any desired order .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",

    "furthermore , the soft modes in the particle - particle channel become massive in the presence of a magnetic field , as they do in disordered systems,@xcite and hence can be suppressed experimentally .",

    ". these effects will be discussed elsewhere.@xcite",
    "we have derived an effective field theory that describes the soft modes , and their effects on observables , in electron systems without quenched disorder .",
    "the soft modes have been identified by means of a ward idendity ; they are particle - hole excitations with a linear frequency - momentum relation .",
    "they are the goldstone modes of a continuous symmetry , namely , a rotation in matsubara frequency space that relates retarded and advanced degrees of freedom and is spontaneously broken whenever the quasiparticle spectral weight is nonzero .",
    "this identifies a fermi liquid as an ordered phase with the quasiparticle spectral weight as the order parameter and the soft particle - hole excitations the corresponding goldstone modes .",
    "a nonzero temperature the goldstone modes acquire a mass , and so do subsets of them in the presence of a magnetic field or other symmetry - breaking external fields .",
    "quenched disorder restricts the goldstone modes to the s - wave or @xmath5 channel , whereas all higher angular momentum channels become massive .",
    "this is the reason why the clean theory is more complicated than the corresponding one for disordered electrons : there are many more soft modes to take into account in clean systems .",
    "it is important to remember that the goldstone modes are _ not _ density excitations , and their existence is not related to particle - number conservation ; the density susceptibility is characterized by zero - sound excitations regardless of whether the symmetry is broken or not , and at any temperature .",
    "technically , we have borrowed heavily from techniques and concepts developed by wegner@xcite for disordered noninteracting electrons and generalized by finkelstein@xcite to the interacting disordered case .",
    "however , the resulting effective field theory in the clean case does _ not _ take the form of a generalized nonlinear sigma model , as it does in the disordered case , but is significantly more complex .",
    "this complexity reflects the presence of many more soft modes .",
    "one manifestation of this complexity is the fact that the effective action contains terms to higher than linear order in the interaction amplitude , whereas in the disordered case only linear terms appear .",
    "the reason is that in the clean case the green function is soft , and the additional powers of the frequency that accompany higher powers of the interaction are compensated by multiplicative green functions . in the disordered case , in contrast , the green function is massive because of the elastic relaxation rate , and terms of higher than linear order in the interaction are irrelevant in a renormalization - group sense .",
    "we have followed wegner@xcite and later work based on his ideas@xcite in bosonizing the theory by introducing classical matrix fields that are isomorphic to bilinear products of fermion fields .",
    "technically , this is done by introducing a lagrange multiplier constraint and integrating out the fermions .",
    "this approach is very different from that of shankar,@xcite who applied renormalization - group techniques directly to the fermionic theory to derive landau fermi - liquid theory .",
    "the lagrange multiplier field , whose expectation value plays the role of a self energy , is soft and needs to be kept to all orders to avoid introducing spurious soft modes .",
    "this has been achieved in terms of diagram rules for the effective theory , with the role of the lagrange multiplier being to eliminate the noninteracting part of certain propagators .",
    "the effective action has not been given in closed form , but an explicit method has been devised to construct it to any desired power in the fundamental soft - mode field .",
    "this allows for a systematic loop expansion , with the inverse fermi velocity playing the role of the bare loop expansion parameter .",
    "the interaction , by contrast , is _ not _ treated perturbatively .",
    "order by order in a loop expansion , the theory thus produces the leading hydrodynamic ( i.e. , long - wavelength and low - frequency ) effects to all orders in the interaction , and the interaction is not required to be weak in any sense .",
    "this , together with its ability to isolate the hydrodynamic contributions to any desired observable , sets the current theory apart from many - body perturbation theory which expands in powers of the interaction , with any resummations to all orders in the interaction being opportunistic and not controlled .",
    "a related feature of the current theory that is even more important is its amenability to renormalization - group techniques .",
    "since it is formulated in terms of an infinite power series in the fundamental field , with each term characterized by an n - point vertex and a corresponding correlation function , the structure of which is dictated by symmetry , the bare theory also suggests the structure of the corresponding renormalized theory , which many - body perturbation theory can not do .",
    "this feature has been exploited extensively in the disordered case to describe , inter alia , the anderson - mott metal - insulator transition,@xcite which had proven very hard to do by means of many - body theory .",
    "certain aspects of the present theory had already been present in the theory put forward in ref .  .",
    "however , since the latter focused on disordered systems , it was formulated in terms of s - wave variables , with the higher angular momentum modes effectively being integrated out . in an application to the clean case",
    ", this led to a nonlocal theory , i.e. , the 3-point and higher vertices did not exist in the hydrodynamic limit of small frequencies and wave numbers .",
    "in addition , no complete separation of soft and massive modes was achieved in that theory for the clean case .",
    "both of these points have been remedied in the present formulation .",
    "the issue of the higher - angular - momentum modes is handled by formulating the theory in terms of phase - space variables , which explicitly keeps all angular momentum channels , and the separation of soft and massive modes has been achieved by expressing the massive modes in terms of the soft ones in a power - series expansion , albeit not in a closed form , in contrast to the disordered case . the relation to the formulation in terms of s - wave variables , which is still useful for certain calculational purposes , has been explained in sec .",

    "formalism for formalism s sake is not very useful , and a crucial test for the present theory will be any physical problems it can solve more easily than other methods .",
    "we conclude this paper by listing several applications that we plan to pursue in the near future , many of which we already have obtained preliminary results for .",
    "the density - of - states calculation in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] is meant only as an illustration of how the loop - expansion - based perturbation theory works within the present context ; it does not achieve anything that can not easily be done with many - body diagrams .",
    "it nevertheless has some important advantages , and points to some crucial future developments .",
    "for instance , as was shown in ref .",
    ", the fermi - liquid state is represented by a stable renormalization - group fixed point , and the leading irrelevant operators with respect to that fixed point can be easily identified .",
    "this shows that the nonanalytic energy or frequency dependence of the dos near the fermi level , eqs .",
    "( [ eqs:5.6 ] ) , is qualitatively exact ; there can not be any contributions with a lower power of the frequency .",
    "this would be impossible to establish within many - body theory .",
    "a related point is that the field theory , in contrast to many - body perturbation theory , is not perturbative in the interaction ; the results at any order in the loop expansion are valid to all orders in the interaction .",
    "other observables will also display universal nonanalytic behavior in the fermi - liquid phase that can be understood as corrections to scaling at the fermi - liquid fixed point , and they can be identified by the same techniques .",
    "one interesting quantity is the two - point correlation function of the local dos . since the dos is the ( zeroth moment of ) the order parameter for the fermi liquid , this plays the role of the order parameter susceptibility , and it is expected to be long - ranged , i.e. , to exhibit a universal divergence for small wave numbers , everywhere in the fermi - liquid phase .",
    "this expected phenomenon is analogous to a well - known feature of the magnetic susceptibility in the ordered phase of a heisenberg ferromagnet.@xcite in ref .",
    "we have used scaling arguments combined with a preliminary version of the current theory to predict that the dos - dos correlation function diverges as @xmath330 for small wave numbers @xmath331 .",
    "we will revisit this problem , together with other aspects of the dos , in more detail shortly .",
    "in addition , the effective theory suggests the existance of a critical fixed point that describes a transition from a fermi liquid to a non - fermi - liquid state .",
    "this will be analogous in many respects to the critical fixed points that describe various versions of the anderson - mott transition.@xcite the basic physical idea is that the fluctuations in a fermi liquid that are represented by the goldstone modes become stronger with decreasing dimensionality and increasing interaction strength , and ultimately give rise to an instability of the fermi liquid since the system can lower its free energy by going into a state that restores the symmetry and thus eliminates the goldstone modes .",
    "a scaling theory for such a transition has been developed in ref .  , and",
    "arguments have been given that suggest that the corresponding fixed point will appear in the present theory at 2-loop order .",
    "the loop expansion will then allow for a controlled description of the transition in @xmath301 dimensions .",
    "the theory can also be applied to magnetic phenomena , i.e. , order in the spin - triplet channel . in sec .",
    "[ subsubsec : iv.a.2 ] we have constructed a saddle - point solution that reproduces the stoner theory of ferromagnetism . by expanding about that saddle point , analogously to the expansion about the fermi - liquid saddle point in sec .",

    "this theory was based on a phenomenological treatment of the fermionic degrees of freedom combined with symmetry arguments , and it does not have the correct limiting behavior as @xmath261 . the current theory will allow for a systematic derivation valid in any dimension @xmath257 that will serve as an important check and will probably point to new developments . it can also be applied to ferrimagnets , the quantum aspects of which have not been considered so far . finally ,",
    "if one considers band electrons instead of the nearly - free electron model we have employed for simplicity , the theory can also describe antiferromagnetism .",
    "treatments of the spin - triplet channel are not restricted to s - wave order . by keeping a triplet interaction amplitude in the p - wave channel ,",
    "( [ eq:2.13d ] ) , one can describe a magnetic nematic or p - wave ferromagnet . in ref .",
    "we have shown that the quantum phase transition from a fermi liquid to such magnetic state is generically of first order , for reasons that are similar to those for the analogous statement for the s - wave ferromagnetic transition .",
    "this is in contrast to hertz - type theories@xcite that predict a continuous transition .",
    "this result was also based on a preliminary version of the current theory , and the present complete formulation will allow for more detailed studies of exotic magnetic states . the same is true for superconducting states , in either the s - wave or higher angular momentum channels .",
