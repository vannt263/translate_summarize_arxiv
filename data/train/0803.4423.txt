    "in the search for correlations among physical parameters of early - type galaxies , it has been recognized that the effective radius ( @xmath13 ) , the effective mean surface brightness ( @xmath14 ) , and the central velocity dispersion ( @xmath2 ) form a planar relation ( in logarithmic space ) known as the fundamental plane ( hereafter fp ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , in the form of @xmath15 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are found to be @xmath10 ( 1.21.5,-0.8 ) at visible wavelengths ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . under the assumption of structural homology and a constant mass - to - light ratio , the virial theorem implies that the fp coefficients should be @xmath16=(2,-1 )  the so - called ` virial expectation ' .",
    "the observed discrepancy , or tilt of the fp with respect to the virial expectation has prompted many discussions to explain its origin ( see @xcite for a review of this field ) .",
    "one of the ideas is that the tilt is caused by the systematic variation in the stellar population as a function of physical parameters such as galaxy luminosity .",
    "@xcite investigated this effect by constructing the fp in @xmath7-band , which is supposedly a good tracer of the stellar mass less affected by age and dust .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite examined the wavelength dependence on the fp coefficients , and concluded that some of the tilt is caused by the stellar population manifested by the color - magnitude relation .",
    "these studies found that the stellar population effect exists , but it can only partially explain the tilt of the fp .",
    "more recent investigations tackle the fp tilt problem using new methods such as gravitational lensing ( @xcite ; @xcite ) or dynamical modeling ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such studies suggest that the fp tilt nearly disappears when the fp is constructed in the mass - domain .",
    "their conclusion is that the tilt must arise from the variation in the central mass - to - light ratio ( @xcite ) , but it is not clear whether the variation is dominated by dark matter or by stars @xcite .    in this letter , we extend the fp analysis to wavelengths beyond @xmath7-band to further investigate the effect of stellar population on the tilt . by doing",
    "so we aim to provide the fp that possibly better represents stellar mass ( see  5 ) , and to improve the constraints on different scenarios for the fp tilt .",
    "early - type galaxies were chosen from the sample of @xcite , which was used to study the fp of nearby early - type galaxies in visible and near - infrared ( hereafter nir ) passbands .",
    "the sample has the velocity dispersion information necessary for constructing the fp .",
    "we then searched for mid - infrared ( hereafter mir)-band . ] archival images for galaxies in the @xcite sample .",
    "for the mir data , we used the spitzer space telescope , infrared array camera ( hereafter irac ; @xcite ) images , covering four wavelength channels at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0@xmath8 m .",
    "the flux - calibrated , mosaiced irac images were retrieved from the spitzer archive for these objects .",

    "we imposed this size limit in order to work with a sample with reliable @xmath0 values ( see  3.1 ) . after removing a few galaxies (",
    "ngc1275 , ngc4824 , ngc4478 , ngc6166 ) that show peculiar light profiles ( multiple source , close to a bright galaxy or stars ) , we finally identified 56 galaxies with irac data in five clusters ( a0426 , a1656 , a2199 , a2634 , and virgo ) satisfying our selection criteria .",
    "we present a brief summary of the photometric information in table 1 .",
    "the exposure times for the irac data range from 72 to 1000 secs .",
    "the above selection of the sample may introduce a bias in the derived fp coefficients ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , such a bias would not affect our derivation of the wavelength dependence of the fp coefficients , since the multi - wavelength fp coefficients will be derived from the same galaxies for which the same bias would apply .",
    "iraf ellipse was used to obtain surface brightness profiles of our irac sample galaxies .",
    "we restricted the fitting region to @xmath18pixels ( along the semi - major axis ) and discarded regions with s/@xmath191 . during the fit , we held the center , and fixed the ellipticities and the position angles of isophotes to those at the effective radius in the 3.6@xmath8 m band .",
    "in addition , 3@xmath20 clipping was applied to reject outliers such as foreground stars . to subtract the background",
    ", we used the values determined from the sextractor @xcite .",
    "the adaptive background mesh sizes were varied between 16 to 96pixels , and the best mesh was chosen to be the one which flattened the growth curve at the largest isophote ( @xmath2136@xmath22 ) .",
    "after the ellipse photometry , we used the de vaucouleurs r@xmath23 law to fit the observed surface brightness profiles measured along the semi - major axis law but found no difference in the fp coefficients ; we therefore kept the r@xmath23 methodology . ] .",
    "the fitting procedure yields the effective radius ( in @xmath24 ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the effective semi major axis and @xmath27 is the axis ratio of the isophote at this position .",
    "we tested the reliability of our fitting procedure using the simulated , psf - convolved galaxies , and found that the surface brightness fitting gives unbiased , reliable results when @xmath28 . at the same time",
    ", we get the mean surface brightness within @xmath0 ( in ab magnitudes ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the magnitude of the total flux within the effective isophote defined by @xmath26 and @xmath31 , while cosmological dimming , galactic extinction ( @xmath32 , using the formula of @xcite , and the extinction curve of @xcite ) , and k - correction are taken into account . the k - correction is computed using the spectral energy distribution of a 13gyr age , solar metallicity , and 0.1gyr burst model from @xcite , assuming the salpter initial mass function . the last observable , @xmath2 is a kinematic parameter and is not expected to vary as a function of wavelength ; we consequently use the same data used for the visible and nir bands @xcite .    in our analysis ,",
    "angular sizes were converted into physical length units for the fp construction by setting the distance to a1656 as 98.1mpc and calibrating the distances to individual clusters , utilizing the nir fp @xcite as a distance ladder .",
    "we fitted the fp coefficients of the multi - waveband sample in the following manner using a variety of methods : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are related as @xmath36 .",
    "for the input @xmath0 and @xmath35 , we use our sb - fit results for mir (  3.1 ) , and those listed in @xcite for v- and k - bands .",
    "we tried five different fitting methods : standard least - squares fit , the inverse least - squares fit , the bisector of the two , the least - squares fit to the orthogonal plane , and the least absolute deviation fit to the orthogonal plane .",
    "these methods are outlined below .",
    "it is natural to think of doing the standard least - squares fit of @xmath37 ( hereafter lsq ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but early fp work mainly took @xmath38 at the ordinate ( @xcite ; @xcite ; hereafter inverse lsq ) for their purposes .",
    "more recent work prefers the least - squares fitting of @xmath37 by minimizing the variance orthogonal to the fp plane ( hereafter orthogonal least - squares fit , or olsq ; @xcite ) or the least absolute deviations orthogonal to the plane ( hereafter orthogonal least absolute deviation fit , or olad ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the orthogonal fitting has an advantage over other methods , reducing the systematic error by treating the variables symmetrically @xcite .",
    "however , the orthogonal methods yield larger measurement errors than the lsq methods , especially for small samples @xcite .    therefore , we also estimated the fp coefficients by taking the bisector , or the plane equidistant from the planes obtained through the standard lsq and inverse lsq ( hereafter the lsq bisector ) .",
    "1,000 monte carlo samplings of subsets of early - type galaxies in @xcite were performed to derive the fp coefficient errors on a sample of 50 early types to justify our approach . through the sampling , we found the errors of the fp coefficients to be @xmath39 , best reproduced with the lsq bisector method , while the other orthogonal methods gave overestimated errors ( @xmath4050% for the coefficient @xmath3 ) . aside from the error estimates , all three symmetrized methods reproduce the fp coefficient @xmath3 of @xcite and the @xmath7-band early - type galaxy sample of @xcite within 5% agreement . on the other hand ,",
    "the standard and inverse lsq methods are found to have about minus and plus 20% systematic biases in the coefficient @xmath3 estimates respectively in comparison to the symmetrized methods . given these results",
    ", we adopted the fp coefficients with the lsq bisector method as our base result .",

    "we further plot the result of the fp fit in figure 1 , overlayed on the data points .",
    "we caution readers to focus less on the absolute values of @xmath16 , but to focus more on the trend of the values with wavelengths or methods ( see discussions at the end of this section and  2 ) .",
    "gathering the outcomes , we are led to the wavelength - dependent nature of the fp coefficients , with @xmath16 values getting close to the virial expectation of ( 2,-1 ) as the wavelength increases . such a tendency has been noted before ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , but our result indicates that it extends to 3.6@xmath8 m , and possibly beyond . when each cluster was analyzed separately",
    ", we also find the trend .    the wavelength dependence of the fp coefficients is further presented in figure 2 , where they are plotted using five different fitting methods (  3.2 ) .",
    "the tilt of the fp is maximally reduced toward the virial expectation at irac - bands , and the thickness of the fp is maintained thin for all but beyond 5.8@xmath8 m . in terms of the methodology , we confirm the analysis of  3.2  the three symmetrized fittings give coefficient @xmath3 values that are fairly consistent with each other ( considering the sample size ) .    to quantify the wavelength dependence , we model the change of coefficient @xmath3 as a linear function of wavelength by simultaneously fitting the olsq , olad , and the lsq bisector results as follows : @xmath42 from the visible to 3.6@xmath8 m ( coefficient @xmath3 behaves flat afterward ) .",
    "this relation nicely explains the difference in coefficient @xmath3 of 0.05 in the sdss g*- to z*-bands @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , for @xmath4 , the tendency is not as linear as that for @xmath3 , but has a local maximum near the @xmath7-band , approaches closest to -1 at the irac 3.65.8@xmath8 m bands , and increases again at 8.0@xmath8 m .",
    "we attribute this behavior at 8.0@xmath8 m to the lower s / n , as well as the complexity in the 8.0@xmath8 m emission which can be dominated by the dust emission in some cases ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . indeed",
    ", the 8.0@xmath8 m fp has the largest scatter among irac bands .",
    "the above result , together with the tendency of coefficient @xmath4 from table 2 , implies that the increase in coefficient @xmath3 and @xmath4 are ( @xmath43 ( 0.34,-0.03 ) from @xmath6-band to 3.6@xmath8 m , and ( @xmath43 ( 0.15,-0.08 ) from @xmath7-band to 3.6@xmath8 m .",
    "if we use the fp coefficients from the references in figure 2 as the base values on which to apply equation ( 2 ) , we obtain @xmath10 ( 1.61.8,-0.9 ) at 3.6@xmath8 m , which is quite close to the virial expectation .",
    "the implication of this result is discussed in the next section .",
    "note that our coefficient @xmath3 in @xmath7-band , derived from a subsample of 56 early - types from @xcite is smaller than the value derived from their full sample of 251 early - types by @xmath44 .",
    "the discrepancy should be mostly due to the limited sample size .",
    "more than half of our mir galaxies belong to the coma cluster ( 29 objects ) , and the coma cluster galaxies in @xcite show coefficient @xmath3 in the @xmath7-band ( @xmath45 ) smaller than the total sample result by @xmath46 , consistent with the results of @xcite . apart from the wavelength dependence , our results seem to be skewed to the fp of the coma cluster .",
    "recent studies suggest that the fp tilt originates mostly from a systematic variation in the mass - to - light ratio ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the cause for the mass - to - light ratio variation is uncertain : it could be due to the stellar population , or the central dark matter fraction @xcite .",
    "also , some studies suggest that the tilt is mostly explained by the non - homology related to the variation in the sersic index n among early - type galaxies @xcite . here , we discuss the implication of our result on these issues .    first , we investigated which one of the parameters - size or luminosity - dominates the observed change in the fp coefficients with increasing wavelength .",
    "this was done by deriving the fp coefficients from the mir sample by replacing ( i ) @xmath0 s or ( ii ) @xmath35 s , with those from the shorter wavelength data ( in our case the k - band ) .",
    "the result is presented in figure 3 ( left ) , showing that the luminosity effect is the dominant factor up to 5.8@xmath8 m .",
    "interpretation at 8.0@xmath8 m is difficult due to low s / n and dust emission .",
    "our result suggests that the stellar population effect is significant going from k - band to irac - bands .",
    "next , we examined to what extent the stellar population plays a role in the fp tilt through the dynamical mass - to - light ratio @xmath47 ( e.g. , @xcite ) variation calculated from the fp coefficients . if @xmath48 , then @xmath49",
    "the study of @xcite suggests @xmath50 based on the visible fp .",
    "our result is that the fp coefficient reaches @xmath51@xmath52 at 3.6@xmath8 m (  4 ) .",
    "in such a case , this relation gives @xmath53 0.060.13 , which enables us to explain more than half of the tilt in the visible fp .",
    "moreover , the reduced tilt in the mass plane ( @xmath54 : @xcite ) is consistent with our @xmath55 from the i - band to the 3.6@xmath8 m in equation ( 2 ) , advocating that the @xmath11 variation is reduced by the regular light distributions in the mir . as for the origin of the fp tilt",
    ", these results add another piece of evidence against the significance of non - homology ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which predicts no change in the tilt with wavelength .",
    "we also derived the @xmath56 parameter by directly fitting the @xmath11 .",
    "figure 3 ( right ) demonstrates that the observed dependence of @xmath11 upon @xmath12 decreases and becomes flatter at irac - bands , just like the changes in @xmath56 derived from the fp coefficients .",
    "combined with the fact that the change in the fp tilt with wavelength is dominated by the luminosity change , our @xmath11-fit result suggests that the rest - frame mir luminosities at 3.65.8@xmath8 m better represent the stellar mass than the shorter wavelengths , somewhat in agreement with @xcite , but not so with @xcite . among many possibilities , a proper combination of the metallicity and the age variation",
    "can possibly reproduce the observed trend , and we plan to investigate as future work , the physical origin of the @xmath11 - @xmath12 relation as a function of wavelength .",
    "we studied the mir fundamental plane relation of 56 early - type galaxies and derived the wavelength dependence of the fp coefficients . when the fp is expressed as @xmath57",
    ", we found that the exponent on @xmath2 , @xmath3 , increases as a function of wavelength as @xmath58 , while @xmath4 reaches closest to -1 without systematic variation with wavelength .",
    "when the fp coefficients of previous studies are adopted as the starting point to calculate the mir fp coefficients , we found that @xmath10 ( 1.61.8,-0.9 ) which is closer to the virial expectation , and that the change is dominated by the luminosity change .",
    "together with the reduced dependence of the @xmath11 on @xmath12 at mir wavelengths , our outcomes suggest that the variation in the stellar population is responsible for a significant portion of the fp tilt , and that the rest - frame mir better probes the stellar mass of low redshift early - type galaxies than the shorter wavelengths .",
