    "there are countless experiments which demonstrate the wave behaviour of light .",
    "two typical experiments are the two - slit and mach - zehnder arrangements . that such experiments demonstrate the wave behaviour of light , even where the light is feeble @xcite , is not in dispute .",
    "what is questionable is the experimental evidence for the particle behaviour of light .    to avoid later misunderstanding of the essential point of this article",
    ", it is necessary for me to make clear that i use the term ` particle behaviour ' to refer to the description prior to the final detected result but not to the character of the final detected result .",
    "this is a more restrictive usage than is usual in the literature where the term ` particle behaviour ' also encompasses the character of the final detected experimental result .",
    "i also use the term ` particle behaviour ' in two context dependent ways : in the context of bohr s principle of complementarity i use the term ` particle behaviour ' to refer to the description of the experiment in terms of the complementary particle concept ( understanding that according to bohr the particle concept , along with other complementary concepts , is an abstraction to aid thought to which physical reality can not be attached ) . in the context of the causal interpretation",
    "i take the term ` particle behaviour ' to be synonymous with ` particle ontology ' .",
    "similar considerations apply to the term ` wave behaviour ' , but the distinction here is not so crucial since a main point of this article is to demonstrate that a final detected result showing a particle character does not force a particle description or particle ontology prior to the final detected result .",
    "more recent and interesting experiments concerning particle - wave duality and complementarity have been suggested and subsequently performed .",
    "et al _ @xcite proposed an experiment involving tunneling between two closely spaced prisms which has since been carried out by mizobuchi _",
    "et al _ @xcite ( although the statistical results of the experiment have been questioned by @xcite ) .",
    "later , brida _ et al _ @xcite realized an experiment suggested by ghose @xcite in which tunneling at a twin prism arrangement is replaced by birefringence . also of interest is afshar s experiment @xcite .",
    "all of these experiments use light and aim to disprove or generalize complementarity ( whereas gra s aim was to confirm complementarity ) by claiming to have demonstrated particle and wave behaviour in the same experiment . in all of these experiments ,",
    "the final detection result is attributed by the authors to which - path information and , therefore , to particle behaviour ( according to the usual criteria accepted in the literature ) , but the experiments are so arranged that the light undergoes a process ( tunneling in the case of mizobuchi _ et al _ s experiment , birefringence in brida _",
    "et al _ s experiment , and interference in afshar s experiment ) which the authors claim necessarily represents wave behaviour .",
    "hence , they claim to observe wave and particle behaviour in the same experiment",
    ". we do not agree with them for the same reasons that we do not agree with gra s claim to have proved complementarity , a claim we will argue against in this article .",
    "generally , we take the view that complementarity is so imprecise that it can neither be proved nor disproved",
    ". we will elaborate further on this in the rest of the article with regard to the gra experiments , but we will also briefly describe and comment further on mizobuchi _ et al _ s , brida _ et al _ s and afshar s experiments in section [ cgbas ] .",
    "we have chosen to focus on the gra experiments in this article because they were the first to introduce a gating system for producing genuine single photon states and because their experiments lend themselves to illustrating important features of ciem .",
    "further , the detailed treatment of this experiment serves as a model that can be easily adapted to the later experiments , thereby providing arguments against the claims of observing simultaneous wave and particle behaviour in these experiments .",
    "the quantum eraser experiment of kim _ et al _ @xcite is a variant of the wheeler delayed - choice idea @xcite .",
    "the use of particle - wave duality and complementarity in this experiment seems to imply that a measurement performed in the present effects the outcome of an earlier measurement .",
    "this now raises the further issue of the present effecting the past , which is surely unacceptable",
    ". we will also give a brief description and comment on this experiment in section [ cgbas ] .",
    "experimental evidence for the particle behaviour of light is mainly of two forms : which - path experiments and the photoelectric effect ( also the compton effect ) .",
    "a closer look at each of these shows that neither unambiguously demonstrate particle behaviour . in the case of the photoelectric effect",
    "it is well known that a semiclassical description can be given in which the light is treated as a classical electromagnetic field and only the atom is treated quantum mechanically @xcite .",
    "a weakness of this counter example is that semiclassical radiation theory is known not to be fully consistent with experiment and fails in those cases where light exhibits nonclassical properties ( as in some experiments which involve second - order coherence ) .",
    "further , it is not clear that a semiclassical model of the photoelectric effect can explain the experimental fact that the photon is absorbed in a time of the order of @xmath0 ( @xcite , p. 10 ) . indeed , it was just this feature of the photoelectric effect that seemed to require that a photon be a localized particle prior to absorption , and is perhaps the reason why the photoelectric effect is commonly regarded as evidence for the particle behaviour of light .",
    "a more convincing argument against the photoelectric effect as evidence of particle behaviour is the provision of a fully quantum mechanical model of the photoelectric effect based on the causal interpretation of the electromagnetic field ( ciem ) @xcite . in ciem , light is modeled as a real vector field ; there are no photon particles for a fock state or with a value an average around @xmath1 for a wave packet . ] .",
    "the field has the property of being nonlocal , meaning that an interaction at one point in the field can change the field at points beyond @xmath2 .",
    "the ciem model of the photoelectric effect is of the nonlocal absorption of a photon by a localized atom .",
    "the photon prior to absorption may be spread over large regions of space .",
    "the fact that the absorption is nonlocal explains the experimental result that the absorption of the photon takes place in a time of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "we are not forced to accept that the photon must be localized prior to absorption .",
    "we conclude that the photoelectric effect can not be regarded as conclusive evidence for the particle behaviour of light .",
    "we note that the compton effect , also commonly accepted as evidence for the particle behaviour of light , can also be modeled by ciem ( @xcite , p. 343 ) , so that this also can not be taken as evidence for the particle behaviour of light .",
    "to be clear , we are not claiming that the final detected results of the photoelectric and the compton effect do not have a particle character ( they clearly do ) .",
    "what we claim is that a particle description prior to the final result , whether from the perspective of complementarity or from the perspective of an ontology , is not forced upon us .",
    "this is because the particle character of the experimental results can be explained in terms of a wave model .",
    "let us now turn to which - path experiments . in a typical which - path experiment light",
    "has a choice of two paths . determining which - path the light actually took",
    "is considered as proof of particle behaviour .",
    "as bohr showed in response to einstein s famous which - path two - slit experiment , if the path is determined with certainty , interference is lost @xcite .",
    "consider a which - path two - slit experiment in which we determine the path by closing one of the holes ( obviously losing interference ) .",
    "although crude , it is conceptually equivalent to einstein s experiment .",
    "the point is , that even when we close the hole and are certain which - path the light took , this does not rule out a wave model .",
    "this argument holds even in more refined which - path two - slit experiments .",
    "we may conclude that in such experiments the which - path criteria for particle behaviour is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "there is an aspect of the two - slit experiment that seems to be universally overlooked and that we wish to draw attention to .",
    "einstein s aim in his which - path two - slit experiment was to obtain the path of an individual photon and still retain an interference pattern , thereby experimentally detecting particle and wave behaviour in the same experiment .",
    "this is contrary to bohr s principle of complementarity which requires mutually exclusive experimental arrangements for complementary concepts @xcite .",
    "as we have said , bohr was able to show that a certain determination of the photon path would destroy the interference pattern .",
    "bohr s response was almost universally accepted and complementarity was saved . but",
    "consider this : forget path determination and consider a two - slit experiment in which an interference pattern is formed .",
    "this interference pattern is built up of a large number of individual photoelectric detections ( or some similar process in a photographic emulsion ) . if the photoelectric effect is accepted as evidence of the particle behaviour of light , then is not particle and wave behaviour observed in the same experiment ?",
    "we now turn to another which - path experiment which uses a beam - splitter .",
    "this will be our main focus in this article because we consider gra s version of this experiment , which uses an atomic cascade and a gating system to produce a near ideal single photon state , as perhaps the best experimental attempt to demonstrate the particle behaviour of light @xcite . in a wave model ,",
    "light is split into two beams at the beam - splitter . in a particle model",
    ", each photon must choose one and only one path .",
    "thus , using feeble light ( one photon at a time ) a particle model predicts perfect anticoincidence , whereas some coincidences are expected in a wave model .",
    "gra therefore took perfect anticoincidence as the signature of particle behaviour .",
    "gra quantified this feature in terms of the degree of second - order coherence .",
    "semiclassical radiation theory predicts @xmath3 .",
    "as we shall see , quantum mechanical coherent or chaotic states give results in the classical regime .",
    "this is to be expected , as neither chaotic nor coherent light exhibits nonclassical behaviour . for number states on the other hand ,",
    "perfect anticoincidence is expected , so that @xmath4 .",
    "photoelectric detectors are placed in each output arm of the beam - splitter . for a detection to take place",
    "there must be enough energy to ionize an atom in the detector .",
    "for classical light , and quantum mechanical chaotic or coherent light , there is always some probability that more than one photon is present after the beam - splitter however feeble the light , and this entails the possibility of coincidences .",
    "but , for a single photon state there is enough energy to ionize only a single atom in one and only one output arm of the beam - splitter , so that perfect anticoincidence is predicted .",
    "the novelty of the gra experiments is the use of an atomic cascade and a gating system , which we describe below , in order to produce near ideal single photon states .",
    "their results gave a value of @xmath5 much less than @xmath6 and confirmed the expected anticoincidence .",
    "gra interpreted their results to be a conclusive demonstration of the particle behaviour of light .",
    "but , underlying the assertion that anticoincidence is a signature for particle behaviour is the assumption that the photoelectric detection process ( or any other atomic absorption process ) is local .",
    "this implies that the photon is a localized particle before absorption by the detecting atom .",
    "but , we saw above that the quantum theory does not rule out nonlocal absorption in the photoelectric effect ( nor , more generally , in any atomic absorption process ) .",
    "in fact , no model of light as photon particles that is consistent with the quantum theory has ever been developed .",
    "on the other hand , ciem models light as a nonlocal field .",
    "atomic absorption processes , including the photoelectric effect , are modeled as the nonlocal absorption of a photon .",
    "ciem has been shown to be fully consistent with the quantum theory @xcite .",
    "our main purpose in this article is to provide a model that explains perfect anticoincidence that does not treat photons as particles . by showing that anticoincidence experiments do not rule out a wave model we prove that gra s experiment can not be viewed as conclusive evidence for particle behaviour of light .",
    "the wave behaviour of light has been confirmed a countless number of times for chaotic or coherent sources . following einstein s 1905 explanation of the photoelectric effect @xcite in which the idea of photon particles was first invoked ,",
    "the question was raised as to whether or not , in very low intensity experiments , single photons alone in the apparatus can produce interference .",
    "numerous experiments using feeble light followed @xcite . with a few exceptions",
    "the conclusion was reached that single photons can interfere with themselves . in such experiments",
    "the energy flux @xmath7 is calculated and the number of photons per unit area per unit time is calculated using @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath7 is reduced to such low levels that it is more probable than not that only one photon is present in the apparatus at any one time .",
    "however , the probability that more than one photon is present remains , so that the single photon nature of these experiments can be questioned . by building a mach - zehnder interferometer around their which - path apparatus gra were able to confirm that the near ideal single photon state produced the expected interference .",
    "although no surprise , gra s experiment is perhaps the first experiment to confirm the interference of single photons .",
    "the wave nature of light is not disputed and it is obvious how in ciem interference is obtained given that light is modeled as a field ( always ) .",
    "we will nevertheless outline the ciem treatment of the mach - zehnder interferometer given in detail in reference @xcite .",
    "ciem is a hidden variable theory .",
    "there is a large literature on hidden variable theories and we direct the interested reader to the three articles cited in reference @xcite .",
    "two of these , one old one new , are surveys of hidden variable theories and include a comprehensive list of references .",
    "we also refer the reader to two interesting ph.d thesis in the area of hidden variable theories @xcite .    in the next sections we describe gra s two experiments focusing on theoretical derivations , and then go on to give the ciem model of these experiments , focusing on the which - path experiment .",
    "the following description of the gra experiments is based mainly on reference @xcite .",
    "the experiments use the radiative cascade of calcium @xmath9 described in reference @xcite . the first cascade to the intermediate state yields a photon @xmath10 of wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "the intermediate state , with lifetime @xmath12 , decays according to the usual atomic decay law for the lifetime of a state ( @xcite , p. 538 ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the probability of decay in time @xmath15 .",
    "the second cascade photon @xmath16 has wavelength @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath16 photon , according to the decay law , is emitted with near certainty within the time @xmath18 of emission of the first @xmath10 photon .",
    "the number of @xmath10 photons per second , @xmath19 , is counted by photomultiplier @xmath20 , and each @xmath10 photon triggers a gate of duration @xmath21 . because the probability of decay within gate @xmath21 is high , there is a high probability that the @xmath16 partner of @xmath10 enters the beam - splitter . for low count rates we can be nearly certain that there is only one @xmath16 photon in the beam - splitter arrangement within the gate time @xmath21 . in this way a near ideal single photon state is produced .",

    "one is therefore not forced to conclude that these experiments require a generalization of bohr s principle of complementarity ( a generalization first suggested by wootters and zurek @xcite as mentioned in the introduction ) , a generalization which is severely flawed , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we will comment further below .",
    "arguments from the perspective of complementarity can be put to show that these experiments do not disprove complementarity .",
    "let us first consider the experiments of mizobuchi _ et al _ and brida _",
    "et al_. bohr emphasized that only the final experimental result ( pointer reading ) has physical significance and that an experiment should be viewed as a whole , not further analyzable @xcite .",
    "we recall the statement of wheeler , ` no phenomenon is a phenomenon until it is an observed phenomenon ' ( @xcite , p 14 ) . in these two experiments ,",
    "the observed results are anticoincidence detections which the above authors and advocates of complementarity or its variants can reasonably and unambiguously attribute to particle behaviour",
    ". the wave behaviour is not detected .",
    "it is therefore perfectly consistent for a bohrian to maintain that the experiments unambiguously define a particle model even if this is counter - intuitive .",
    "the afshar experiment avoids this criticism because the presence of the wire grid physically detects the interference .",
    "but , the afshar experiment still fails because of the first point above , namely that ciem provides a wave model of image formation by a large series of single photon detections .",
    "another point to consider is that the mutually exclusive wave and particle complementary concepts are not related to the mathematical formalism of the quantum theory . in this way",
    "they differ from complementary concepts such as position and momentum or the components of angular momentum which are not mutually exclusive classical concepts and are represented in the mathematical formalism of the quantum theory by heisenberg uncertainty relations . in this case",
    ", what is called wave or particle behaviour in a given experiment is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "apart from other points , this arbitrariness is an important reason why we feel complementarity can neither be proved nor disproved .",
    "we now comment on a widely accepted generalization of complementarity by wootters and zurek in their influential article @xcite .",
    "this generalization admits partial wave and partial particle behaviour in the same experiment .",
    "based on this generalization wootters and zurek @xcite , and later yasin and greenberger @xcite , cast particle - wave duality in mathematical form .",
    "we have argued in earlier articles @xcite that far from being a generalization of complementarity , this approach in fact contradicts complementarity . from the mathematical perspective ,",
    "these mathematical relations are constructs appended to the formalism of the quantum theory but not derived from it . as a measure of coherence",
    "they can be thought of as useful heuristic rules , but for the reasons we will give , can be attributed no more fundamental significance than this . for detailed arguments against this generalization",
    "we refer the reader to reference @xcite and restrict ourselves here to briefly emphasizing aspects of complementarity which demonstrate our point of view .    in his explanations of his principle of complementarity @xcite ,",
    "bohr repeatedly emphasized the mutual exclusiveness of complementary concepts , and the requirement of mutually exclusive experimental arrangements for their correct use or definition .",
    "he further emphasized that complementary concepts are abstractions to aid thought , and can not be attributed physical reality .",
    "it seems to the present author that bohr was concerned to provide a framework for the correct use of classical language or concepts .",
    "thus , for the same physical object to be both a wave and a particle is , quite simply , a contradiction of definitions .",
    "this , the present author believes , is what led bohr to emphasize that complementary concepts could not be attributed physical reality . by insisting on mutually exclusive experimental arrangements for the realization of complementary concepts , bohr , in the authors view , allowed for the use of classical language / concepts in a way that avoids contradiction .",
    "it is for these reasons that we regard the wootters and zurek generalization of complementarity in terms of partial particle behaviour / knowledge and partial wave beaviour / knowledge as the complete antithesis of bohr s principle of complementarity .",
    "even apart from bohr s teachings , what can it mean for a physical object to be partially a wave and partially a particle ?",
    "above , we made a distinction between particle and wave complementary concepts and other pairs of complementary concepts that bohr did not make .",
    "our arguments here need not apply to complementary concepts such as position and momentum , which classically are not mutually exclusive concepts .",
    "we note two things : first , the wootters and zurek generalization of complementarity is in terms of wave and particle concepts .",
    "second , from the point of view of interpretation , particle and wave complementary concepts are the most fundamental , and lie at the heart of the interpretational issues of the quantum theory .",
    "the experiment of kim _ et al _ concerns both complementarity and the wheeler delayed - choice issue , but its significance goes beyond these issues .",
    "the results of this experiment appear to suggest that a present measurement affects a past measurement .",
    "the wheeler delayed - choice experiments indicate that a present measurement either creates or changes the past history leading to a particular result ( there are subtle differences between wheeler s and bohr s position which are discussed in reference @xcite section 1 ) .",
    "the kim _ et al _ and wheeler delayed - choice experiment differ in that the past history is not actually observed in wheeler s experiment , whereas in kim et al s experiment it is the result of an actual past measurement that is changed by a measurement in the present .",
    "we will leave a detailed discussion of this experiment for a later article , but make one observation .",
    "the experiment uses a pair of correlated photons produced by the process of spontaneous parametric down conversion . by detecting the photon partner _",
    "after _ the first photon is detected , the earlier measured wave or particle behaviour of the first photon is determined .",
    "what seems to have been left out of the kim _ et al _ analysis is that once the first photon is detected and the state of the epr partner changes accordingly , thereafter , the epr correlation is broken .",
    "hence , any measurement performed on the second photon can have no effect on its partner .",
    "this is a firm prediction of quantum mechanics . nevertheless , the strange result in which a present measurement appears to determine the outcome of an earlier measurement needs explanation .",
    "other articles relating to this issue can be found in reference @xcite .",
    "their ingenious gating system allowed gra to test , perhaps for the first time , quantum mechanical predictions for a single photon state .",
    "interference is confirmed in the obvious way .",
    "the which - path predictions are also confirmed ; the photon is detected in only one path .",
    "what we have shown though , is that a wave model ( ciem ) can explain this result .",
    "it can not therefore be concluded that the detection of the photon on one path confirms particle behaviour . in a particle model ,",
    "the photon takes one path at the beam - splitter and is detected in that path , whereas in our wave model the photon splits at the beam - splitter , is nonlocally absorbed , and is again detected in only one path . since the which - path measurement does not confirm particle behaviour , bohr s principle of complementarity is also not confirmed , contrary to what is claimed by gra .",
    "we conclude then , that gra s experiments do not confirm complementarity .",
    "we may further add that if complementary is accepted , wheeler s delayed - choice experiments lead to very strange conclusions : either history is changed at the time of measurement , or history is created at the time of measurement @xcite .",
    "ciem , on the other hand , explains wheeler s delayed - choice experiments in a unique and causal way .",
