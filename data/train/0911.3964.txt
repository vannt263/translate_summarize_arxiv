    "one of the crucial ingredients in the upcoming area of quantum technologies will be the capability of coherently manipulating quantum systems at a distance , such that _ entanglement _ ( _ i.e. _ , quantum correlations ) can be created between different nodes of a global quantum system .",
    "entanglement is one of the most peculiar features of quantum mechanics , and the most distinct signature of quantum coherence .",
    "entangled states of two or more particles not only play an important role for tests of quantum nonlocality [ 1 - 3 ] , but also lie at the heart of quantum information processing and quantum computing [ 4 ] . entangled quantum states come in many flavours , such as bell , einstein - podolsky - rosen [ 1 ] , greenberger - horne - zeilinger [ 3 ] , or w states [ 5 ] , generally depending on the dimensionality and tensor product structure of the hilbert spaces involved .",
    "all these states have different qualities and are suitable for different roles in quantum information protocols [ 3,5 ] . in this context , entangled states of multiple systems with hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath0 ( _ i.e. _ of ` qudits ' , with @xmath1 ) offer their specific advantages over the  archetypical and most commonly considered  entangled states of two - dimensional systems ( of ` qubits ' ) .",
    "for instance , entangled states of two qudits violate local realism more strongly than entangled states of two qubits , and their entanglement is more resilient to noise [ 6 ] .",
    "also , quantum cryptographic protocols where qubits are replaced with qudits are both more secure and faster ( in that more information may be sent , on average , per sent particle ) [ 7 ] .",
    "entangled states can currently be generated in a variety of physical systems , such as trapped ions [ 8 ] , quantum electrodynamics cavities ( qed ) [ 9 ] , superconducting circuits [ 10 ] , semiconductor quantum dots [ 11 ] , linear optical systems [ 12 ] and impurity spins in solids [ 14 ] .",
    "cavity qed [ 14 ] , which concerns the interaction of atoms and photons inside optical cavities , provides experimentalists with a very favorable setting for the generation of entanglement .",
    "atomic systems are qualified to act as qubits or , more generally , qudits , as appropriate internal electronic states can coherently store information over relatively long time scales . at the same time , in such systems photons are suitable for the transfer of information between distant nodes .",
    "high - finesse cavities can provide good insulation against the environment and can thus have long coherence times [ 15 ] .",
    "two - atom bell states , and three - particle ( two atoms plus one photon ) ghz entangled states have been experimentally demonstrated with rydberg atoms passing through a superconducting microwave cavity [ 16,17 ] .",
    "schemes for the generation of entangled states of two _",
    "` qutrits ' _ ( _ i.e. , _ of two three level quantum systems ) for two atoms via a single nonresonant cavity have also been proposed [ 18 ] . however , in order to be used for quantum communication protocols [ 19 ] , such an entanglement should be generated between _ distant _ atoms , like atoms trapped in different cavities .",
    "`` distributed '' atomic entanglement requires a way to coherently mediate the interaction between the two atoms .",
    "one way to establish this interaction is through coincidence detection of photons leaking out of the cavities [ 20 ] : in this way , entangled states are only probabilistically generated and the success probability is dependent on the efficiency of photon detectors .",
    "the other possibility is to directly link the cavities with an optical fibre , waveguide or by a third mediating cavity : entangled states can be deterministically generated in such a way [ 21,22 ]",
    ". both types of quantum connectivity essentially allow for the distribution of entanglement across a quantum network [ 23 ] .    in this paper , we shall present a way , based on the proper choice of atomic levels structure and operating regimes , to engineer a deterministic coherent interaction between two qutrits embodied by atoms trapped in distant cavities , linked by a third optical resonator .",
    "we will then move on to study the entanglement that can be generated by such an interaction , as well as its resilience to imperfections and quantum noise .    before proceeding ,",
    "let us first review some previous schemes for the deterministic generation of entangled states via such a type of connected cavities [ 22 ] .",
    "several schemes have been proposed for the deterministic generation of several diverse kinds of entangled states [ 24 - 28 ] , including bell states [ 24 ] , w states [ 28 ] , ghz states [ 26,28 ] , and also qutrit entangled states [ 25,27 ] . in the schemes of refs .",
    "[ 25,26 ] , the adiabatic passage along dark states is employed . these schemes [ 25,26 ]",
    "are based on accurately tailored sequences of pulses and thus require a considerable degree of control .",
    "in other schemes [ 22,24 ] , the rabi oscillations of the whole system composed of the atoms , cavity modes , and fibre modes is utilized ; the entangled states are generated through the exchange of excitation numbers for the atoms and photons .",
    "hence , such schemes [ 22,24 ] are bound to be rather sensitive to atomic spontaneous emission and photon losses . in other schemes [ 27,28 ] ,",
    "the population of the atomic excited states can be effectively suppressed by virtue of dispersive atom - field interactions , but the photonic states in the cavities or fibre are still populated , so that the whole system is still sensitive to photon losses .    the scheme we propose here is different from all such previous schemes [ 22,24 - 28 ] , even from those adopting adiabatic passage [ 25,26 ] .",
    "the scheme is inspired by a previous idea for virtual - photon - induced phase gates between two distant atoms [ 29 ] . in the scheme",
    ", the entanglement is generated through virtual population of not only the atomic excited states but also the photonic states in the cavities and fibre .",
    "therefore , our scheme will turn out to be well shielded from both atomic spontaneous emission and photon losses .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we specify our conditions on the physical parameters and derive the effective hamiltonian for the system . in sec .  [ entanglement ] , we discuss the generation of two qutrit entangled state via the effective hamiltonian and study the reliability of the entangled state in the presence of mismatches in the system s parameters . in sec .",

    "it should be noted that , for the selected frequencies of the classical and cavity fields , additional transitions can not be induced due to the large difference of the energy levels between the @xmath45 and @xmath46 states of the ground manifold @xmath47 . in interaction picture , the hamiltonian describing the interaction of the atoms with the cavity and classical fields can then be written as @xmath48,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 ( @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52 ) denotes the energy difference between the fields and the corresponding atomic transition @xmath53 in cavity @xmath54 ; @xmath55 is the coupling strength of the atom with the polarised photon mode in cavity @xmath54 and satisfies @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 and @xmath58 being the atom - cavity coupling constant and clebsch - cordan coefficient , respectively ) ; @xmath59 and @xmath60 are one - half rabi frequency and phase of the classical field , and @xmath61 denotes hermitian conjugate .    under the condition of larger detuning , i.e. ,",

    "it should be noted that the process for the generation of the qutrit - qutrit entangled state in the present scheme is at variance with previous strategies adopting dispersive interactions [ 27 ] , because here the occupation of both the atomic excited states _ and _ of the photonic states in the cavities and fibre are negligible .",
    "moreover , the external control in the present scheme is less demanding , as the preparatory step to put the atom in a specific superposition of two ground states [ 25,27 ] or the local manipulation of one of the atoms ( by yet another classical field ) during the temporal evolution of the whole system [ 25 ] , are not required here .    in the above analysis , exact knowledge of the system parameters",

    "in summary , we have proposed a scheme of atomic levels ( with an explicit possible realisation in zeeman sublevels of alkali atoms ) , where qutrit quantum information can be stored in three ground states and , most importantly , manipulated globally between distant nodes through the virtual excitation of excited atomic levels and mediating bosonic fields like , typically , light .",
    "our scheme is different from any previously proposed ones in that this choice of atomic levels allows for the whole coherent evolution of the global system  involving the two atoms and the linking bosonic modes  to be driven by the virtual excitation of _ both _ the atomic excited levels _ and _ the intervening fields .",
    "this feature renders our scheme remarkably more robust than any other previously proposed in the face of decoherence , whose main sources in these settings are photon loss and spontaneous emission from excited levels . also , our scheme  being based , essentially , on the proper choice of atomic levels and operating regimes  requires very modest control and proves to be rather resilient against experimental imperfections as well .",
    "all these qualitative remarks have been substantiated in this work by a very thorough quantitative analysis of such unwanted effects .",
    "clearly , a price has to be paid for improved robustness : the use of exclusively virtual excitations makes these coherent manipulations very slow if compared to schemes adopting resonant couplings [ 33 ] .",
    "ultimately , the choice between faster , resonant schemes and more robust , virtual ones should depend on the use one intends to make of them . of course , speed would be paramount in applications directly related to quantum computation .",
    "however , as pointed out in the introduction , qutrit systems are mainly interesting for quantum communication purposes , where the most delicate task to accomplish is precisely the robust distribution of entanglement between distant nodes of a network , and speed is not as crucial : the present , fully virtual scheme would respond precisely to this need . in this perspective",
