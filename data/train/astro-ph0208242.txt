    "@xcite introduced the interacting winds model to account for the development of spherical planetary nebulae ( pn ) . in this model a massive , low - velocity wind removes a large fraction of the envelope material during the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase of evolution , and is followed by a higher - velocity , lower - mass wind .",
    "the high - velocity wind snowplows into the previously ejected agb wind material and sweeps up gas to form a pn .",
    "the majority of pn exhibit aspherical structure , ranging from slightly elliptical to bipolar @xcite .",
    "other investigators have extended the interacting winds model to explain the formation of these aspherical objects @xcite .",
    "understanding the origin of asymmetric structure in pn has been the focus of extensive research in recent years . to achieve asymmetric pn morphologies",
    ", the interacting winds model requires that mass loss during the early phases of the development of these objects is aspherical . this aspherical structure",
    "is then amplified through the wind - shaping that occurs as the pn evolves .",
    "observationally , the time that aspherical structure becomes important is becoming clear .",
    "mass loss during the agb is predominantly spherical @xcite , while the morphologies of proto - planetary nebulae are typically aspherical @xcite .",
    "these findings indicate that during the late - agb and/or post - agb phase , the mass loss becomes aspherical ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "the mechanism that triggers this change in the character of the mass loss is not well understood .",
    "suggestions for this trigger range from binary star evolution @xcite to the effects of magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "a recent hst narrow - band h@xmath0 survey of the morphologies of low excitation pn @xcite revealed a dazzling array of complex structures in these objects including jets , knots , bubbles , and loops .",
    "the large variety of structures seen in these images can not be explained by the interacting winds model alone .",
    "sahai & trauger suggested that phenomena such as jets acting during the early post - agb phase may play a role in creating the complex structures seen in these objects .",
    "recent co observations of several young pn with collimated outflows have demonstrated that these outflows are significantly disrupting and interacting with the neutral shells surrounding these objects @xcite .",
    "both the hst imaging and the co observations suggest that jets could have a significant impact on the way we think about the evolution of pn .",
    "the interaction of the jet with previously ejected material may influence the morphological evolution of pn in a way that is not considered in current models of pn formation .",
    "further , the phenomena driving the change from spherical to aspherical mass loss in the early stages of pn development are not clear .",
    "the formation of jets may play a role in the change to aspherical mass loss in some objects .    if jets are playing a major role in the shaping of pn , their influence will be most significant at a time when the pn still has a large neutral envelope and before the fast wind develops .",
    "we present hst observations of gl 618 , a young pn undergoing the stage of evolution immediately preceding the pn phase , during which recently lost material has begun to disperse but the fast wind has not fully developed .",
    "gl 618 is surrounded by a shell of dust and neutral gas that extends well beyond the optical nebula ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "our new observations have allowed us to confirm that jets are present in gl 618 and to better understand the importance of these outflows in development of this object .",
    "ground - based optical and near - ir imaging of gl 618 reveal two lobes of emission ( each about 3@xmath4 in extent ) separated by a dark lane .",
    "the central regions of the nebula are hidden from direct view at optical and near - ir wavelengths by the lane of obscuring material .",
    "the spectrum of gl 618 is composed of a faint continuum and a variety of low - excitation emission lines . @xcite and @xcite used spectropolarimetry to study gl 618 and found that the continuum and part of the permitted line emission are reflected from deep in the nebula .",
    "the low - excitation , forbidden line flux and remainder of the permitted line emission are produced in the bipolar lobes .",
    "trammell et al . demonstrated that shock - excited emission dominates the spectra of the lobes of gl 618 with the emission indicative of shock velocities in the range of 50@xmath2100 km s@xmath3 .",
    "long - slit optical spectroscopy of gl 618 suggests that the shock emission is associated with out - flowing gas @xcite .",
    "@xcite present a recent detailed ground - based spectroscopic study of gl 618 .",
    "their analysis of the emission line profiles and ratios suggest shock velocities in the range 75@xmath2200 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the largest velocities correspond to the tips of the bullets that we see in our hst images .",
    "near - ir spectroscopy of gl 618 has revealed the presence of thermally excited h@xmath5 emission @xcite .",
    "this object also exhibits [ ] emission thought to be associated with the shock - heated gas @xcite and more recent observations establish that at least part of this emission is associated with an outflow @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented high spatial resolution near - ir images of gl 618 taken with the subaru telescope .",
    "the structure observed in the near - ir extends beyond the optical nebula and these images reveal the presence of `` horns '' and bullet - like structures associated with the bipolar lobes of gl 618 .",
    "ueta et al .",
    "suggest that the [ ] emission is associated with these features .",
    "these features are coincident with the tips of the outflows that we see in our hst images .",
    "these authors also found high velocity co clumps at the positions of the ir bullets when they re - examined existing @xmath6co j=1 - 0 interferometry data .",
    "our new hst observations demonstrate that the source of the shock - excited emission in gl 618 is a set of highly collimated outflows originating in the central regions of the object .",
    "we have obtained wfpc2 images of gl 618 as part of a hst cycle 6 program .",
    "gl 618 was centered in the planetary camera which has a 36x 36field of view and a plate scale of 0.0455pixel@xmath3 .",
    "images were obtained through three filters selected to isolate strong shock - excited emission lines , and thus trace the outflow in this source .",
    "the filters used were f631n ( isolating [ ] @xmath76300 line emission ) , f656n ( isolating h@xmath0 line emission ) , and f673n ( isolating [ ] @xmath7@xmath76717,31 line emission ) .",
    "in addition , we obtained images through f547 m in an attempt to measure the adjacent continuum emission .",
    "the images of gl 618 were obtained on 23 october 1998 ut and exposure times ranged from 15 to 45 minutes .",
    "the images were processed through the hst data reduction pipeline procedures and cosmic rays were removed by combining several exposures of each object . the images were flux calibrated using the standard conversion to flux provided during the pipeline reduction procedures .    we have not removed the continuum from the narrow - band images that we present in this work .",
    "the f547 m continuum band is contaminated by many weak emission lines making it impossible to reliably use images through this filter for continuum subtraction .",
    "alternatively , we could have used an average value for the continuum derived from our ground - based work to remove continuum emission from our hst images . however , the line to continuum ratio is highly variable across the nebula making this approach unreliable .",
    "we point out that the continuum is approximately flat across the wavelength range covered by our narrow - band filters ( as indicated in the ground - based spectroscopy , @xcite ) and that this continuum is significantly weaker than the line emission in our ground - based spectroscopy ( average line to continuum ratios of 50 to 125 for h@xmath0 , [ ] , and [ ] ) .",
    "further , the line emission seen in our hst images is concentrated in knot - like structures . in these regions of intense line emission , the line to continuum ratio is higher than the average values derived from the ground - based work .",
    "consequently , the lack of continuum subtraction does not significantly affect our conclusions regarding the overall morphology of the shock - excited emission .",
    "we have used our narrow - band images to form several line ratio maps for gl 618 .",
    "the problems with continuum subtraction do introduce an additional error ( approximately 10% in the worst case ) into these maps .",
    "however , the primary purpose of these maps is to determine the outflow velocity .",
    "the outflow velocity is determined by comparing the observed line ratios with ratios predicted by models of shock - excited emission .",
    "the comparison with shock models results only in a range of possible shock velocities .",
    "the relatively small errors introduced into the line ratios by the lack of continuum subtraction do not significantly alter the value of the shock velocity that we derive .",
    "previous ground - based optical and near - ir work indicate that out - flowing gas is present in gl 618 ( see section 1 for discussion ) .",
    "we present hst narrow - band imaging of gl 618 that confirm the presence of outflows in the lobes of this object and reveal the morphology of these flows .",
    "figure 1 shows the 3-color image of gl 618 created by combining the h@xmath0 , [ ] , and [ ] narrow - band images of this object .",
    "figure 2 shows the individual narrow - band images .",
    "at least three distinct outflows are visible in each lobe of gl 618 .",
    "the opening angles of these outflows are small , approximately 10 @xmath815 .",
    "the central star is not visible in the hst images , consistent with previous optical and near - ir images @xcite .",
    "a dust lane obscures the central star at optical wavelengths .",
    "the morphologies seen in the [ ] and [ ] hst images are similar ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "these images trace the morphology of the shock - excited emission in gl 618 .",
    "the brightest emission occurs near the tip of each of the outflows and there is no forbidden line emission seen in the central regions of gl 618 .",
    "careful examination of the tip of the outflow labeled _ a _ in the west lobe of gl 618 ( see figure 1 ) reveals an excitation gradient across this region .",
    "h@xmath0 is brightest on the side of the knot that is facing away from the central regions of gl 618 .",
    "this type of gradient is expected as material flowing away from the central source impinges on the surrounding nebular material .",
    "the bright spots at the tips of the outflows are not clumps of material being overrun by a wind or outflow @xcite . in this case",
    ", the brightest h@xmath0 emission would be present on the side of the bullet - like structures facing the central object . based on their near - ir images and a reanalysis of high resolution co data ,",
    "@xcite also argue that the shock - excitation is produced when fast - moving material impacts the surrounding nebula .",
    "the morphology observed in h@xmath0 differs from the forbidden line morphology .",
    "h@xmath0 emission is associated with the outflows , but in addition , a significant amount of h@xmath0 emission is seen towards the central regions of gl 618 ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations indicate that part of the h@xmath0 emission is reflected and part of this emission is produced by shocks in the lobes @xcite .",
    "we have spatially separated these components in the hst images .",
    "at least part of the h@xmath0 emission associated with the central regions of the object is probably reflected emission from an region buried deep in the nebula .",
    "recent ground - based spectroscopy confirms that part of the h@xmath0 in the inner regions is scattered @xcite .",
    "a high density region has been observed at the center of gl 618 at radio wavelengths @xcite and in the reflected optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 emission coincident with the outflows is the shock - excited component of the permitted line emission .",
    "in addition to the h@xmath0 emission associated with the inner regions of the object and the outflows , a faint halo of emission is present in the h@xmath0 image ( best seen in figure 2 panel _ a _ ) .",
    "this faint halo is most likely h@xmath0 emission scattered by dust present in the outer regions of gl 618 .",
    "gl 618 is known to be surrounded by an extensive molecular and dust envelope ( see section 1 for discussion ) .",
    "the dusty material is probably part of the shell of material ejected by the central star of the object during its late agb evolution .",
    "the axis of symmetry appears to be different for the scattered light envelope and the outflows seen in gl 618 .",
    "three outflow features are seen in the images of gl 618 .",
    "we believe that these features are the result of three separate outflows occurring simultaneously in gl 618",
    ". alternatively , these features could be the result of one precessing jet .",
    "however , if this were the case we would expect to see s or spiral shaped morphology in the emission from the outflow @xcite .",
    "we do not observe this type of morphology in the lobes of gl 618 .",
    "we have further investigated the nature of the outflows by considering the recombination times of the ionized gas in the outflows .",
    "the presence of photoionized gas appears to be limited to the immediate vicinity of the central star in gl 618 .",
    "this suggests that there is no significant source of ionization in the lobes of gl 618 other than that caused by thermal excitation in the outflows .",
    "if an outflow precesses away from a region , that region will continue to emit until the gas cools and recombines .",
    "emission from s@xmath9 is seen in all three outflow features .",
    "we can estimate the amount of time that the gas would continue to produce [ ] line emission after the outflow precesses away from a region by calculating the recombination time for s@xmath9 .",
    "the recombination time , @xmath10 , is given by @xmath11 where _",
    "n@xmath12 _ is the electron density and @xmath0 is the recombination coefficient .",
    "the electron density is approximately 10@xmath13 @xmath14 based on ground - based spectroscopy @xcite and the recombination coefficient for s@xmath9 is 1.8 x 10@xmath15 @xmath16 s@xmath3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for t=10,000 k ) .",
    "the s@xmath9 would recombine in approximately 1 year after the outflow moved away from a region .",
    "based on this result , we conclude that the three features seen in our hst images are three separate ongoing outflows .",
    "it has been suggested that simultaneous , multiple outflows have occurred or are occurring in several other young pn including the starfish twins @xcite , gl 2688 @xcite , roberts 22 @xcite , and the frosty leo nebula @xcite .    a ring - like morphology is seen in the outflows in all of the hst images ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "this is most evident in the bright outflow labeled _ b _ in figure 1 .",
    "this morphology has not been seen in any ground - based images .",
    "the presence of these structures offers an opportunity to estimate the inclination of gl 618 .",
    "@xcite estimated the inclination of gl 618 be to 45based on their optical spectroscopy .",
    "if gl 618 were viewed pole - on ( @xmath17 90 ) we would expect the rings to be perfect circles .",
    "instead , we see elliptical structures . we have estimated the inclination of three of the outflows based on the shapes of the rings as seen in the h@xmath0 and [ ] images . for the brightest outflow in the east lobe ( labeled _ b _ in figure 1 )",
    ", we estimate an inclination of 39@xmath1 4 . for the outflow labeled _ c _ in the east lobe",
    ", we estimate an inclination of 59@xmath1 10 .",
    "the feature labeled _ d _ in figure 1 implies an inclination of 36@xmath1 4 .",
    "these results suggest that the outflows in gl 618 are not co - planar .",
    "these results also indicate that the previous estimate of the inclination of gl 618 was an overestimate .",
    "@xcite also find a lower inclination for gl 618 .",
    "based on their spectroscopic observations of h@xmath0 in gl 618 , these authors calculate an inclination angle of 24@xmath1 6 .",
    "the ring - like features occur at semi - regular intervals along the outflows and could indicate that the source of the jet is episodic .",
    "@xcite modeled this type of structure for episodic outflows associated with young stars .",
    "alternatively , the rings could be the result of instabilities in the outflow .",
    "if the rings are the result of an episodic jet , we can estimate the amount of time between ejection events by looking at the spacing of the rings .",
    "the ring - like structures seen in outflow labeled _ b _ in figure 1 are separated by approximately 0.5 .",
    "assuming an outflow velocity of 120 km s@xmath3 ( see discussion later in this section ) for the jet and a distance to gl 618 of 1.5 kpc , this implies an ejection event approximately every 35 years .",
    "note that distance to gl 618 is uncertain and estimates range from 0.9 to 2 kpc @xcite .",
    "a dark arc is evident in the h@xmath0 image of the west lobe ( see figure 2a ) .",
    "this arc is located approximately 1.5from the center of the dark lane .",
    "the dark arc is a region where there is a deficit of h@xmath0 emission .",
    "we believe that we are seeing dust in silhouette at the position of the dark arc .",
    "this dust could be located in the outer edge of the lane of dust obscuring the central star of gl 618 . on the other hand",
    ", it could be a feature in the extended halo of gl 618 .",
    "this halo is the remnant of agb mass loss in this object .",
    "if the arc is a feature of the dust halo of gl 618 , it might be similar to the arcs seen in hst images of gl 2688 , another young planetary nebula .",
    "the arc structure in the extended scattered light halo of gl 2688 is explained as episodic mass loss by the star during the late agb phase of evolution @xcite .",
    "a deep image of the scattered light halo of gl 618 could reveal if this type of episodic mass loss occurred in this object .",
    "we have measured the average value of line ratios at the tips of the outflows labeled _ a , b , _ and _ e _ in figure 1 .",
    "these are the regions where out - flowing material is impacting the surrounding nebula . in these regions",
    "[ ] / h@xmath0 = 0.37 @xmath2 0.40 and [ ] /h@xmath0 = 0.11 @xmath2 0.16 .",
    "the values of the line ratios at the tips of the outflows provide an estimate of the shock velocity , and thus the outflow velocity in these regions .",
    "the bullet - like structures seen at the tips of the outflows have the geometry of bow shocks .",
    "our estimates are an average of the line ratios across the entire bow shock region .",
    "only the line ratios at the head of the bow shock , where the velocity component perpendicular to the shock is greatest , will reveal the maximum shock velocity .",
    "the rest of the bow shock consists of oblique shocks that result in line ratios indicative of lower shock speeds .",
    "therefore , the shock velocity derived by examining line ratios from the entire region of the bow shock will provide an average value of the shock velocity .",
    "the outflow velocity at the tip of the outflow will be larger .",
    "we have compared the observed line ratios with the models of thermally excited emission produced in a bow shock presented by @xcite .",
    "the line ratios are most consistent with their model of a bow shock with velocity 100 km s@xmath3 . if we compare our results to the planar shock models presented by hartigan et al .",
    ", we find that our observed line ratios are consistent with a shock velocity in the range of 40@xmath2100 km s@xmath3 .",
    "note that these models do not include the effects of magnetic fields .",
    "the field strength at the tips of the outflows is likely to be small so that this assumption is valid .",
    "however , if the field is strong ( @xmath18 300 @xmath19 g ) in these regions , we could be underestimating the shock velocity by 20@xmath240 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the shock velocity is a measure of the relative speeds of the colliding gas . in the case of gl 618",
    "an outflow is colliding with a surrounding shell of material that was ejected during the agb / post - agb phase . @xcite",
    "have estimated an overall outflow velocity for the extended co shell around gl 618 of 20 km s@xmath3 .",
    "assuming that the outflows are colliding with gas moving at approximately 20 km s@xmath3 , the measured shock velocity ( 100 km s@xmath3 ) indicates a velocity for the collimated outflow to be about 120 km s@xmath3 ( v@xmath20 = v@xmath21 + v@xmath22 ) .",
    "this is consistent with estimates of the outflow velocity based on previous spectropolarimetry @xcite and with optical and near - ir kinematic measurements ( see section 1 ) .",
    "this value is also consistent with the shock velocities recently reported by @xcite .",
    "based on an outflow velocity of 120 km s@xmath3 and assuming a distance to gl 618 of 1.5 kpc , we calculate the kinematic age of the outflows .",
    "the brightest outflows ( labeled _ a _ and _ b _ in figure 1 ) extend approximately 6from the center of gl 618 in the hst images .",
    "we assume an inclination of 39(see previous discussion ) .",
    "these parameters yield a kinematic age of @xmath23 500 years for the outflows seen in the hst images .",
    "the outflows seen in gl 618 are a recent phenomenon and probably became active shortly after the star left the agb .",
    "@xcite detected emission from cs in gl 618 .",
    "this emission has an x - like morphology and is confined to the inner 4of the object ( this corresponds to the dark lane that we see in our optical images ) .",
    "the outflows that we see in the optical seem to be a continuation of the cs structure , as the optical outflows continue along a line extended from the cs structure .",
    "@xcite examined the co emission in gl 618 at high spatial resolution . the majority of the co emitting gas in gl 618 is participating in a spherical expansion at 20 km s@xmath3 .",
    "however , these high spatial resolution observations reveal that the halo of co emission is not entirely spherically symmetric .",
    "the co exhibits an x- like structure in the halo .",
    "this structure appears as 3 bright spots of co emission located approximately 20from the center of gl 618 .",
    "these areas of low - velocity ( 20 km s@xmath3 ) co emission are along the same axis as the cs and optical emission and are exterior to the optical outflows .",
    "the fact that the low - velocity co emission related to the outflow is exterior to the optical emission is important .",
    "this indicates that the outflow is interacting with the neutral shell surrounding gl 618 .",
    "jets are playing a major role in the morphological development of this pn .",
    "our observations demonstrate that emission from highly collimated outflows dominates the optical emission and morphology of gl 618 .",
    "a comparison of the optical images with previous molecular line studies indicates that the jets are interacting with the neutral envelope surrounding gl 618 .",
    "this interaction is shaping the neutral envelope of gl 618 and will determine the morphological evolution of this object .",
    "gl 618 is undergoing the early stages of pn development .",
    "only a small region of photoionized gas is present in gl 618 and this ionized gas is found only in the immediate vicinity of the central star @xcite .",
    "the fast wind described in the interacting winds model @xcite has not fully developed in gl 618 .",
    "the interacting winds model suggests that it is the interaction of this fast wind with the surrounding neutral envelope that dictates the morphological evolution of a pn . in gl 618",
    "the fast wind will be interacting with a neutral envelope that has already been significantly altered by the action of the jets .",
    "the interaction of the jets with the neutral envelope seen in gl 618 is not unique .",
    "recent observations of several other young pn indicate that jets may have a much more significant role in the overall development of these objects .",
    "co observations of pn known to contain collimated outflows have shown that these outflows are having a major impact on the surrounding neutral shells ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , in bd+303639 the co observations reveal a pair of high velocity molecular knots just outside the ionized nebula .",
    "this is very similar to relationship between the molecular material and optical jets seen in gl 618 . in all of these objects",
    "the jet s interaction with the neutral shell , not interacting winds , could be the dominant mechanism in determining the overall morphology of the pn .",
    "the complex , multi - polar geometry observed in gl 618 is not unique .",
    "@xcite presented hst images of two young pn , he 2 - 47 and m1 - 37 ( dubbed the starfish twins ) . these objects exhibit multi - polar morphology that is similar to that seen in gl 618 .",
    "sahai suggests that jets established the complex geometry of these nebulae .",
    "he estimates that the jets were active within the past few hundred years and suggests that multiple outflows occurred simultaneously in these objects .",
    "while the overall morphology of these objects is similar to gl 618 , there are some differences .",
    "knots or bullets of emission are prominent at the tips of the outflows in gl 618 .",
    "these types of structures are not evident in the images of he 2 - 47 and m1 - 37 .",
    "these bright spots mark the point where active jets collide with ambient material in gl 618 .",
    "the jets are no longer active in the starfish twins so that the regions that correspond to tips have cooled significantly and do not appear as bright spots .",
    "co observations and hst imaging strongly suggest that jets play a important or dominant role in the shaping of some pn .",
    "these jets appear to be short - lived and they seem to operate during the post - agb and/or ppn phases of evolution .",
    "early jet action sets the stage for the complex morphologies we observed in some pn .",
    "high spatial resolution spectroscopy of these objects is needed to better understand the dynamics of the outflows and their impact of the surrounding material .",
    "the overall morphology of the neutral envelope of gl 618 , as traced by co , is spherical @xcite .",
    "the more recent mass outflows in this object are clearly aspherical .",
    "as is the case in other pn , the mass loss in gl 618 appears to have switched from spherical to aspherical soon after the star left the agb .",
    "the kinematic age of the outflows suggest that the jets turned on sometime shortly after the star left the agb .",
    "the trigger for the switch from spherical to aspherical mass loss in gl 618 appears to be the formation of collimated outflows in this object .",
    "the debate concerning the origin of collimated outflows and also the formation of aspherical pn in general , centers on whether binary or single stars are responsible for producing aspherical mass loss .",
    "both models of binary star interaction @xcite and magnetic confinement @xcite , while providing a scheme for producing the overall aspherical structure in pn , may also provide mechanisms to produce the highly collimated outflows .",
