    "what remains is an inhomogeneous problem with zero boundary data , which can be solved with knowledge of the green function of @xmath12 .",
    "thus we have reduced the problem of approximating @xmath6 to that of approximating a green function .",
    "a well  known , classical formula due to hadamard ( see @xcite , for example ) approximates the change in a green function due to perturbations of the domain , but we ll instead make use of a result approximating the change arising from operator variation , as detailed below .    now let s be more specific . consider a schrdinger operator @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a smooth scalar function .",
