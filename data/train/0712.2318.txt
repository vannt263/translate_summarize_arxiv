    "+   + chiral de rham complex of beilinson and drinfeld @xcite is an attempt to extend conformal field theory ( cft ) to the case of target manifolds which do not necessarily obey the condition of the vanishing first chern class of tangent bundle @xmath1 .",
    "we usually exclude such a situation from our consideration since non - linear sigma model on such a target manifold contains a logarithmic divergence and hence a non - vanishing beta function .",
    "scale invariance will be lost in such a situation and one can not apply the method of cft .    one way of realizing the idea of beilinson and drinfeld is to use the patchwise construction by malikov - schectman - vaintrob where one considers cft defined on each coordinate patch and then considers the consistency of the theory under coordinate transformation among different patches . in the case when the manifold is covered by , say , 4 patches @xmath2 , one first considers successive transformations @xmath3 . in the end",
    "one finds that under the total coordinate change @xmath4 the fields do not quite come back to their original values but there appears an additional term .",
    "namely , there exists an obstruction or anomaly for a consistent cft in such a system .",
    "it has been suggested that the obstruction is related to the first potryagin class of the manifold [ gorbounov - malikov - schechtman , witten , nekrasov , et.al . ] .    in this paper",
    "we follow the approach of malikov - schechtman - vaintrob@xcite and study the case of del pezzo surfaces which are rational surfaces obtained from @xmath0 by blowing up a certain number of points .",
    "we study the cases of one - point , two - point , and three - point blowups of @xmath0 and show that the anomaly on these surfaces is in fact proportional to the first pontrjagin class .",
    "we consider this is a substantial evidence in favor of the suggestion by witten and nekrasov . in chapter 2 of this these",
    "we start with the general theory of @xmath5 system ( conformal dimensions of @xmath6 are 0 and 1 , respectively ) where @xmath7 field is identified as the local coordinate of the manifold and @xmath8 field is identified an 1-form . following [ malikov - schechtman - vaintrob ] and nekrasov",
    "we discuss the transformation laws of @xmath6 system under coordinate change so that their ope is preserved .",
    "then in chapter 3 we discuss the case of @xmath0 as the target manifold and reproduce the result of witten .",
    "in chapter 4 we consider the case of del pezzo surface which is an 1,2,3-point blow up of @xmath0 , which has the vanishing pontrjagin anomaly in the 1 point case .",
    "we compute the obstruction for these cases and find that they are proportional to the first pontrjagin class of the manifolds .",
    "computations are somewhat lengthy but straightforward . non - trivial aspect of the computation is the change in the convention of the normal ordering when one goes to a different coordinate patch and we have to make a careful analysis . in chapter 5",
    "we present some discussions and conclusions . in appendix",
    "a we explain the historical background of wess - zumino - witten theory . this theory is used in the ansatz of nekrasov([nekrasovansatz ] ) as the 1-form @xmath9 . in appendix",

    "<S> recently the chiral algebra of beilinson - drinfeld draws much attention in the mathematical physics of superstring theory . </S>",
    "<S> naively , this is a holomorphic conformal field theory with integer graded conformal dimension , whose target space not necessarily has the vanishing first chern class . </S>",
    "<S> this algebra has two ways of definition : one is that of malikov - schechtman - vaintrob by gluing affine patches , and the other is that of kapranov - vasserot by gluing the formal loop space . </S>",
    "<S> we will use the method of malikov - schechtman - vaintrob in order to compute the gerbes of chiral differential operators .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will examine the two independent ansatzes of witten s ( 0,2 ) heterotic strings and nekrasov s generalized complex geometry are consistent in the case of @xmath0 , which has 3 affine patches and is expected to has the 1st pontrjagin anomaly . </S>",
    "<S> we also extend this direction to the case of 2 dimensional toric fano manifolds ( toric del pezzo surfaces ) of all degrees , by blowing up the generic 1,2,3 points of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these coincide with the computation of the hirzebruch riemann - roch theorem . </S>",
    "<S> the most notable case is the 1 point blowup , where the total gauge invariant anomaly vanishes .    the significant future direction towards its application to the geometric langlands program is also discussed in the last section .    </S>",
