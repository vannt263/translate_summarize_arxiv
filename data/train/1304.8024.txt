    "among the most studied properties of the nuclear fission of actinides are the distributions of mass , charge and kinetic energy associated to complementary fragments .",

    "it was demonstrated that that broadening @xmath45 distribution is due to the neutron emission and the sharp fall on @xmath39 in the mass region around @xmath44 .",
