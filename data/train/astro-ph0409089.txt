    "according to the theory of self - initiated , ambipolar - diffusion  controlled star formation , ambipolar diffusion is responsible for the fragmentation of molecular clouds and the formation of thermally and eventually magnetically supercritical protostellar fragments ( or cores ) in initially magnetically subcritical parent clouds ( see reviews by mouschovias 1987 , 1996 , and references therein ) .",
    "the formation of supercritical fragments takes place on a timescale between @xmath1 and a few @xmath2 yr , depending on the initial mass - to - flux ratio , and degree of ionization of the parent cloud . the subsequent contraction of the supercritical cores and",
    "the formation of stars within them is dynamic but slower than free - fall .",
    "a number of authors have recently claimed that a series of observational results on the ages of molecular clouds and the timescale of star formation suggest that molecular clouds are `` young '' compared to the ambipolar - diffusion timescale , and hence these observations contradict the predictions of the ambipolar - diffusion theory ( e.g. , hartmann _ et al .  _ 2001 ; elmegreen 2000 ) .",
    "we re - examine these underlying observations and show that the timescales they claim to be measuring are severely underestimated , because they only represent _ part _ of the relevant processes ( star formation and lifetimes of molecular clouds ) .",
    "we then show that the quantitative predictions of the ambipolar - diffusion theory for the timescales of the _ observed _ phases of star formation are in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "there is no observational support for a scenario of `` rapid star formation '' .",
    "it has been argued that the sound - crossing time in molecular clouds , given their observed typical size and temperature , is @xmath0 yr and that ( 1 ) this places a lower limit on the lifetime of molecular clouds , and ( 2 ) that the clouds are expected to harbor a stellar population of comparable age ( hartmann _ et al .",
    "_ 1991 ) . yet , based on hayashi - track age estimates , the pre - main  sequence stars found in surveys are typically younger ( @xmath3 yr ) @xcite .",
    "this apparent discrepancy is known as the `` post  t - tauri problem '' .",
    "hartmann _ et al .  _",
    "( 1991 ) estimated the age of t - tauri stars in the taurus molecular cloud using pre - main  sequence evolutionary tracks to obtain their masses and from that the kelvin - helmholtz timescale .",
    "they found a relatively short mean age ( @xmath4 yr ) and they concluded that the mass estimates from standard hayashi pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks are not reliable .",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1992 ) repeated the study for a larger sample of newborn stars at different parts of the taurus cloud with the same results .",
    "however , this time the conclusion was that the molecular clouds must be younger than previously thought .",
    "subsequent work focused on refining the pre - main  sequence evolutionary tracks , but comparison between different sets of tracks for low - mass pre - main  sequence stars yield only a factor of 2 difference in the age estimates @xcite .",
    "hence the consensus is that the expected population of older ( @xmath5 5 myr ) pre - main  sequence stars is missing .",
    "the above considerations have led to the `` rapid star formation '' scenario ( ballesteros - paredes _ et al .  _ 1999 ; elmegreen 2000 ; hartmann 2001 ; hartmann _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , which favors short - lived ( @xmath6 a few myr ) molecular clouds and consequently a short ( @xmath7 myr ) timescale of star formation .",
    "according to this scenario , giant molecular clouds form rapidly ( in a time @xmath3 yr ) due to colliding streams of turbulent flows .",
    "`` cores '' ( of sizes @xmath8 ) within giant molecular clouds then also form rapidly due to supersonic turbulence and immediately collapse dynamically to form stars .",
    "although the observations cited above have significantly contributed to a better understanding of the t - tauri phase of star formation , the conclusions that have been drawn from them concerning the overall duration of the star - formation process and the ages of molecular clouds are not valid .",
    "they are based on a fundamentally flawed understanding of the star formation timeline .    to demonstrate this point",
    ", we show in figure [ fig_timeline ] a star - formation timeline depicting the star - formation process as a whole , starting at mean molecular cloud densities and ending with the emergence of zero - age main - sequence stars .",
    "we distinguish three different phases . in phase",
    "a , which has a duration @xmath9 , typical `` starless cores '' form and contract toward the creation of protostars . at the end of phase",
    "a , hydrostatic protostellar cores ( protostars ) have formed , and accrete mass through phase b , which has a duration @xmath10 .",
    "finally , when mass accretion stops , the pre - main  sequence stars contract , almost at constant mass , at the kelvin - helmholtz timescale @xmath11 .",
    "these objects are known as t - tauri stars , and the time interval during which the kelvin - helmholtz contraction takes place is phase c , with duration @xmath12 . at the end of phase c ,",
    "the stars reach the zero - age main - sequence .",
    "all the aforementioned observational work estimates the duration of the t - tauri phase , or phase c in figure 1 .",
    "the `` zero point '' of what the authors call `` age '' of the t - tauri stars is the beginning of phase c. therefore , all the quoted estimates for the `` ages '' are only estimates of @xmath13 .",
    "these measurements offer no information at all on the duration of phases a and b , and hence on the duration of the star - formation process _ as a whole _ , or on the ages of molecular clouds .",
    "the notion that phases a and b are short compared to phase c ( t - tauri phase ) and therefore the duration of phase c sets the timescale for the star formation process as a whole _ is not _",
    "( and can not be ) supported by observations measuring only the duration of phase c. in fact , as we discuss in ",
    "[ sec_stat ] , measurements of the duration of phase a yield @xmath14 . consequently",
    ", neglecting phase a leads to a serious _ underestimate _ of the timescale of star formation and to erroneous conclusions about the age of molecular clouds .    if the neglected time interval @xmath15 corresponding to phase a is long compared to the kelvin - helmholtz timescale ( as is typically , but not always , the case in ambipolar - diffusion  induced core formation in magnetically subcritical clouds ) , then the overall ages of the pre - main  sequence stars are @xmath16 yr , and the `` post - t - tauri '' problem no longer exists .",
    "observations of the age spreads of stars in galactic open clusters have yielded diverse results .",
    "some observations showed significant age spreads ( e.g. , ngc 3293 , herbst & miller 1982 ; ngc 6231 , sung _ et al .  _ 1998 ) , while others found no appreciable age spreads ( e.g. ngc 6531 , forbes 1996 ; ngc 3293 , baume _ et al .",
    "similarly , attempts to use the spread of the estimated ages of t - tauri stars to study the history of star - forming regions ( palla & stahler 2000 ) were hampered by observational errors and uncertainties ( hartmann 2001 ) .",
    "still , results suggesting small age spreads in star clusters have been used to draw support for the idea that molecular clouds are younger than their sound crossing times ( @xmath0 yr ) and for the rapid star - formation scenario ( e.g. , elmegreen 2000 ) .",
    "these conclusions are based on the implicit assumption that the cluster age spread is always comparable to the molecular cloud lifetime , @xmath17 , which , as shown in figure [ fig_spreads ] , is not true .",
    "figure [ fig_spreads ] is a sketch of the star formation history of a molecular cloud according to the ambipolar - diffusion theory ( fig .",
    "[ fig_spreads]a ) , and according to the rapid star - formation scenario ( fig .",
    "[ fig_spreads]b ) .",
    "time increases upward along the vertical axes .",
    "the two solid horizontal lines represent the instances of birth and dispersion of the parent cloud .",
    "each parallelogram represents the time @xmath18 for the formation of stars from material of mean cloud density .",
    "the first star forms @xmath18 _ after _ the birth of the cloud . in figure",
    "[ fig_spreads]a , @xmath19 ( longer , unshaded part of each parallelogram ) is the time required for the formation of a magnetically supercritical core and is comparable to the ambipolar - diffusion timescale , @xmath20 ; and @xmath21 ( shorter , shaded part of each parallelogram ) is the duration of the later stages of star formation .",
    "_ no stars can form after the dispersion of the parent cloud unless a supercritical core has already formed by the time of dispersion_. hence , the rightmost parallelogram in figure [ fig_spreads]a is not realizable in nature and is crossed out in the figure . altogether then , if the age spread @xmath22 of the stars formed during the lifetime of a particular molecular cloud is determined observationally , the general relation allowing the determination of the parent molecular cloud lifetime @xmath23 is ( see fig . [",
    "fig_spreads]a ) : @xmath24 using equation ( [ theeq ] ) , the _ observed values _ of @xmath22 , and the ambipolar - diffusion theory of star formation ( @xmath25 ) , we find molecular cloud lifetimes to be consistent with molecular cloud age estimates based on cloud crossing times ( @xmath0 yr ) .. ]    the interpretation of observations of age spreads according to the proponents of the rapid star - formation scenario is shown in figure [ fig_spreads]b . in this case , the core formation phase is essentially non - existent , @xmath26 , so equation ( [ theeq ] ) gives @xmath27 and the molecular clouds are found to be young .",
    "however , such an interpretation _ can not _ possibly be considered as observational support for the rapid star - formation scenario because _ the assumption of rapid star formation , @xmath26 , is already built in_.",
    "another technique for inferring the timescale of star formation has its origin in the following simple statistical argument : since a core with an embedded point source ( hydrostatic protostellar object ) is preceded , in an evolutionary sense , by a starless core , then the ratio of the number of cores with embedded point sources and the number of starless cores should reflect the ratio of the duration of each phase ; i.e. , @xmath28 ( beichman _ et al .",
    "this method has been employed to estimate the evolutionary timescale of prestellar cores ( ward - thompson _",
    "et al .  _ 1994 ; jijina _ et al .  _ 1999 ; lee & myers 1999 ; jessop & ward - thompson 2000 ) .",
    "lee & myers ( 1999 ) presented an all - sky survey of optically selected cores and found an overall ratio of cores with embedded point sources and starless cores of about 0.3 . using values for the evolutionary timescale of the embedded point - source phase between @xmath29 yr ( class 0 and class i objects )",
    ", they concluded that the duration of the starless core phase is about @xmath30 years .",
    "based on a survey of nh@xmath31 cores , jijina _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1999 ) found a similar result . in both cases",
    ", the authors concluded that the number of detected prestellar cores is too small to be consistent with ambipolar - diffusion  initiated star formation predictions .",
    "ward - thomson _ et al .  _",
    "( 1994 ) and jessop & ward - thompson ( 2000 ) used 100 @xmath32 and 60 @xmath32 all sky surveys and found a ratio @xmath33 of cores with embedded point sources and starless cores . from this result , using a value @xmath34 years ( including in this phase class 0 , class i , and class ii objects ) , they found @xmath35 years and concluded that this value is consistent with the ambipolar - diffusion theory of the starless core phase .",
    "caution should be exercised when using the results obtained in the way described above .",
    "observationally , only the ratio of @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be determined .",
    "a specific estimate for either one of the two timescales requires a theoretical value for the other . any theoretical uncertainty in the assumed timescale",
    "is carried over to the estimated one . however , even if one accepts the value for @xmath38 as derived from an assumed @xmath37 , one should be very careful in comparing it with ambipolar - diffusion  induced core formation and evolution timescales .",
    "first , typical starless cores spend an appreciable fraction of phase a in figure [ fig_timeline ] having column - density contrasts with the parent cloud too low to be identified as `` cores '' .",
    "second , _ the actual duration of the starless core phase is not a universal number in the ambipolar - diffusion theory .",
    "it depends on the mass - to - flux ratio _ ( @xmath39 ) _ of the parent molecular cloud _ @xcite .    to demonstrate the first point , we plot in figure [ fig_column_a ] the column density of a model ambipolar - diffusion  controlled `` core '' , in units of the background column density of the parent cloud , as a function of time",
    "the solid line represents the value of the average column density of the oblate fragment when observed face - on out to a radius where a magnetically supercritical core eventually forms .",
    "the dot - dashed line corresponds to the value of the central column density of the core .    in all the observational work reviewed above , a density contrast of at least a factor 2 - 4",
    "is required in order to identify an object as a `` core '' . as seen clearly in figure [ fig_column_a ]",
    ", the model cloud requires @xmath0 years before it reaches a column - density contrast of 2 with respect to the background ( parent cloud ) , during which time it would not be identified as a core in observational surveys .",
    "a density contrast of a factor of 3 is not developed until after about @xmath40 years .",
    "hence , observational surveys miss a large part of the evolutionary phase preceding the formation of a supercritical core , and the actual duration of phase a is therefore severely underestimated ; i.e. , the fraction of phase a observable by these surveys is only a small fraction of the entire duration of phase a ( @xmath41 of fig .",
    "[ fig_timeline ] ) .",
    "the model cloud of figure [ fig_column_a ] is characterized by a relatively small initial mass - to - flux ratio [ @xmath42 0.25 ] . to demonstrate the dependence of the duration of phase a on @xmath43 , we plot in figure [ fig_column_b ] the time evolution of the central number density of the core for three different values of @xmath43 ( see , also , fiedler & mouschovias 1993 , fig .",
    "the horizontal solid line corresponds to the minimum central density of a well - defined ammonia core ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the shaded bands represent the duration of the observable ( using ammonia cores ) part of phase a. for the most subcritical cloud ( @xmath45 , _ solid line _ ) , @xmath46 myr , while it is only @xmath47 myr for the case @xmath48 ( _ dashed line _ ) , and @xmath7 myr for the case @xmath49 ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) .",
    "thus the lifetime of the observable `` starless core '' predicted by the ambipolar - diffusion theory depends on the value of the mass - to - flux ratio of the _ parent _ molecular cloud , and can be @xmath50 myr , in complete agreement with observations .",
    "the closer to the critical value the mass - to - flux ratio is , the smaller the observable starless - core lifetime , with a lower limit being the magnetically diluted free - fall timescale .",
    "we have re - examined the observational estimates of the lifetimes of molecular clouds and the timescale of star formation ( based on ages of t - tauri stars , age spreads of stars in clusters , and statistics of pre - stellar cores ) . _",
    "all available measurements or estimates of the duration of different phases of the star formation process and of molecular - cloud lifetimes are completely consistent with the theoretical predictions of the ambipolar - diffusion  controlled fragmentation of molecular clouds and evolution of the protostellar fragments_.    observations of ages of t - tauri stars only measure the duration of the late stages of star formation ( after the formation of a hydrostatic core ) and offer no information on the earlier stages , which can be ( and , according to the ambipolar - diffusion theory , typically are ) of much longer duration .",
    "these observations are consistent with molecular - cloud lifetimes @xmath51 myr .    observations of age spreads of stars in clusters can only be used to derive molecular - cloud lifetimes under some assumption concerning the core formation timescale @xmath19 ( see eq . [ [ theeq ] ] ) . in the ambipolar - diffusion  induced star formation theory",
    ", @xmath19 is the ambipolar - diffusion timescale , and observations suggesting @xmath52 are consistent with molecular - cloud lifetimes of @xmath53 .    in a typical molecular cloud ,",
    "ambipolar diffusion requires @xmath53 to produce a core with a factor of 2 density contrast with respect to the parent cloud .",
    "it is only after this time that the object can be identified as a core in observational surveys .",
    "the remaining , observable lifetime of a `` starless core '' is only a few myr , a value consistent with observations measuring the ratio of starless - core and embedded - point  source lifetimes .",
    "the observable lifetime of a starless core depends , according to the ambipolar - diffusion theory , on the initial mass - to - flux ratio of the parent cloud .",
    "the closer to critical this ratio is , the shorter the observable `` starless core '' lifetime ( which can be @xmath54 for nearly - critical clouds ) .    altogether , there is no observational evidence suggesting that molecular clouds are younger than their sound - crossing times .",
    "therefore , `` rapid '' star formation is _ not _ an `` observational requirement '' , all statements to the contrary notwithstanding ."
