    "one of the major tools in galactic dynamics is the decomposition of the rotation curves ( hereafter , rcs ) of spiral and lenticular galaxies into baryonic and dark components .",
    "this mass decomposition produces constraints on the distribution of dark matter in these galaxies , which permits the investigation of the possible relations between baryons and dark matter , and most importantly to study the properties of galactic dark matter halos .",
    "two spherical halo models are usually used for the mass decomposition of rcs . on one hand , cosmologists tend to favor the navarro et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter , nfw ) model @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the radius where the density profile has a ( logarithmic ) slope of @xmath2 ( the  isothermal \" value ) and @xmath5 is the local density at that radius . the nfw model was originally thought @xcite to provide a universal description of halos of different mass produced in dissipationless ( i.e. dark matter only ) cosmological simulations run with different cosmologies , in particular in the lambda cold dark matter ( hereafter , @xmath0cdm ) paradigm .",
    "it has a cuspy inner structure with an inner slope of @xmath6 and logarithmically diverges in mass at large radii .",
    "note that steeper inner cusps ( inner slopes as steep as @xmath7 ) have been produced in other dissipationless cosmological simulations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the analysis of rcs has traditionally used the so - called pseudo - isothermal ( hereafter , iso ) model @xmath8 which is often called the core halo because of its finite central density ( but linearly diverging mass at large radii , where the asymptotic density slope is @xmath2 ) .",
    "this halo has no cosmological background but is often seen to better fit galactic rcs than the nfw model , particularly for dark matter dominated objects like low surface density galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for which the baryonic contribution can be largely neglected and the mass density profile as derived from the rc `` directly '' traces that of the dark matter halo .",
    "the disagreement between an observed , apparently finite , central density and the expectation of a steeper density profile from the @xmath0cdm cosmological simulations remains an unsolved problem in galactic dynamics ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , this _ cusp - core controversy _ has often been invoked as a major weakness of the current standard cosmological model of hierarchical growth of structures starting from a nearly homogeneous universe , seeded with density fluctuations arising from a @xmath0cdm power spectrum .",
    "however , the impressive agreement between @xmath0cdm predictions and observations of the angular fluctuation spectrum of the cosmic microwave background suggests that other explanations for the controversy must be sought , either in the dissipative and feedback physics of the baryons or in a more detailed analysis of halo density profiles from @xmath0cdm cosmological simulations .",
    "recently , @xcite have proposed another model that fits the density profiles of halos in @xmath0cdm simulations even better than the nfw model .",
    "it was later realized @xcite that the model advocated by @xcite had been previously introduced for the distribution of stellar light and mass in galaxies @xcite , with density profile @xmath9\\right\\ } \\ , \\label{eq : rhoeinasto}\\ ] ] where , again , @xmath4 is the radius where the density profile has a slope of @xmath2 and @xmath5 is the local density at that radius .",
    "while both the nfw and iso models are described by two parameters , a characteristic scale and a characteristic density at that radius , the einasto model involves a third parameter , @xmath10 , the einasto index , which describes the shape of the density profile .",
    "the einasto model is the three - dimensional equivalent of the srsic model @xcite that provides an excellent fit to the surface brightness profiles of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite).cdm simulations @xcite are well - fit by an @xmath11 srsic model ( srsic 1968 ) . ]",
    "kpc and density @xmath12 @xmath13  pc@xmath14 are the same for all models .",
    "only the einasto index @xmath10 changes as indicated by values and lines of various colour and style .",
    "the dotted black lines correspond to models with @xmath15 ( bottom curve ) and @xmath16 ( upper curve ) . ]",
    "the mass profile of the einasto halo @xcite is written as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the incomplete gamma function .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rceinasto ] ( top panel ) , the net effect of increasing the halo shape index @xmath10 at fixed characteristic density and radius is to increase and steepen the density profile @xmath19 in the central part of the halo .",
    "this then leads to increase the inner slope and amplitude of the rc ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : rceinasto ] ) .",
    "equation  [ eq : meinasto ] also implies that an einasto halo has a finite mass , whose physical feature is advantageous with respect to the divergent nfw and iso mass profiles . at fixed characteristic einasto scale density and radius , the mass profile converges more rapidly to its virial mass for small indices than for larger ones .",
    "because the inner rcs are expected to probe deeply inside the halos down to scales of 1/300th of the virial radius , where navarro and co - workers have found small but significant departures between the density profiles of @xmath0cdm halos and the nfw model , it has been suggested ( e.g. @xcite ) that the shallower inner slope of the einasto model should reconcile the observed rcs with @xmath0cdm models .",
    "however , no extensive mass decompositions of galactic rcs using einasto halos have yet been carried out .",
    "only the rc of the andromeda galaxy has been modeled with the einasto formula @xcite , though with no real improvement with respect to the usual core and nfw halos as caused by the peculiar shape of the m31 rc .",
    "note also that @xcite compare the central dark matter densities of a sample of low surface brightness galaxies @xcite to a family of einasto halos and conclude that these match the data reasonably well .",
    "the present article aims to provide the first mass decompositions of rcs with the einasto model on an important sample of spiral galaxies .",
    "the questions we wish to address are the following .",
    "is the einasto halo a good fit to the rcs of galaxies ?",
    "is it a better description of observations than the usual nfw and iso halos ? what does a typical galactic einasto halo look like ?",
    "we use a subsample from the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things ) , as described in @xcite ( @xcite , hereafter d08 ) and in  [ sec : observations ] , and compare the quality of einasto halo fits with those obtained using the nfw halo and pseudo - isothermal sphere (  [ sec : massmodels ] ) .",
    "we investigate the statistical significance of possible improvements of the einasto model (  [ sec : comparisoneinastoisonfw ] ) , determine the parameter space of einasto halos for the things sample (  [ sec : halofamily ] ) and compare the properties of galaxy - sized halos generated in numerical simulations to those derived from our sample (  [ sec : compsimu ] ) .",
    "we also describe a range of einasto indices ( constrained two - parameter models ) that provide better fits to rcs than the iso and nfw models (  [ sec : twoparam ] ) .",
    "this article is intended to be the first in a series that aims at investigating how well the einasto formalism works in galactic dynamics and at quantifying the degree of cuspiness of dark matter halos as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "the wmap3 cosmology @xcite is adopted throughout this work .",
    "the  observations of galaxies used in this study are from the  nearby galaxy survey ( things , * ? ? ?",
    "this survey consists of high - resolution 21-cm observations of thirty - four nearby ( closer than 15 mpc ) spiral and irregular galaxies ( sb to i m ) .",
    "the galaxies were observed with the very large array ( vla ) in its b , c , and d configurations .",
    "the  data and the complete details of their reduction have been presented in previous articles from the things series ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we analyze here the sample of seventeen rotationally dominated and undisturbed galaxies presented in d08 , which is a subset of the whole sample from @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to d08 for the details of the kinematical analysis of the  velocity fields by tilted ring models to extract the rotation curves .",
    "d08 has also presented a complete dynamical analysis of those rcs with the nfw and iso models .",
    "we have modeled the mass distribution using different rcs from those published in d08 , as explained in  [ sec : independentvelocities ] .",
    "we have performed levenberg - marquardt non - linear least - squares fits to the rcs , taking into account the contributions of the gas , a spherical stellar bulge , a stellar disk , and a spherical dark matter component .",
    "these contributions were taken from d08 for the stellar and gaseous rcs and from equation  ( [ eq : meinasto ] ) for the halo .",
    "basically the ( atomic only ) gaseous disk rcs come from things  surface densities and the stellar rcs from @xmath20 surface brightness profiles , available for all our galaxies from complementary observations with the _ spitzer _ nearby galaxy survey ( sings , * ? ? ?",
    "the advantage of using these near - infrared luminosities , is that they are little affected by internal or galactic extinction .",
    "we have not considered models with free mass - to - light ratios in combination with einasto halos .",
    "such an analysis will be presented in a future paper ( chemin et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "instead we have adopted the fixed mass - to - light ratios @xmath21 of d08 , who derived @xmath21 from the 2mass @xmath22 colors , adopting @xmath23 @xcite , and @xmath24 , extrapolated from @xcite .",
    "@xcite derived stellar mass - to - light ratios assuming stellar populations with a bursty star formation history with a diet - salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "as in d08 we also consider the @xcite imf , which decreases the mass - to - light ratios ( hence stellar masses ) by 0.15 dex .",
    "a @xmath25 law @xcite was used to derive the vertical distribution of the stellar disk , under the hypothesis that the disk scale - height @xmath26 is one fifth the radial disk scale - length @xcite .",
    "none of our mass models take into account the contribution of molecular gas because the total gas surface densities are atomic gas dominated for the majority of our sample @xcite .",
    "however we briefly report on the effects of molecular gas on einasto halo parameters for the extreme case of ngc 6946 in  [ sec : molecgas ] .",
    "following d08 the rcs of the galaxies ngc  2403 and ngc  3198 have been decomposed using either one single stellar disk component ( labeled  ngc2403d \" and  ngc3198d \" ) or two stellar components .",
    "also , for ngc7793 we present the analysis of the whole rc , as well as that of its rising part only ( `` ngc7793s '' ) . for each assumed imf",
    ", fits have been performed using fixed and free einasto indices for sake of comparison with cosmological simulations , as will be presented in section  [ sec : compsimu ] .",
    "further technical details of the fitting procedure are given in @xcite .",
    "the rcs we fit here are sampled differently from those analyzed in d08 , where the  rotation velocities used for the dynamical analysis are not totally independent .",
    "d08 used a sampling of two data points per spatial resolution element . as a consequence",
    "they did not directly compare the @xmath27 values obtained for the core and cusp models but instead studied the differences in @xmath27 .    since a direct comparison of the reduced @xmath27 values for the different two- and three - parameter models is essential to identify the `` best '' halo model",
    ", one has first to investigate whether any correlation between spatially adjacent rotation velocities could alter the results of the mass modeling . for this purpose",
    ", we have derived mass models of several galactic rcs from d08 and @xcite using three different samplings , assuming einasto , nfw and iso halos .    a first modeling exercise ( s1 )",
    "was done with rcs sampled with two points per beam ( as in d08 ) , a second one ( s2 ) with one point per beam ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a third one ( s3 ) with one point every two beams .",
    "the last two samplings provide independent data points , as opposed to the first one .",
    "the velocity uncertainties are defined as in d08 or @xcite , taking into account the ( generally dominant ) kinematical asymmetry observed between the receding the approaching halves of each galactic disk .",
    "we observe the following results ( which are strictly speaking only valid for the range of samplings explored here and should not be further generalized ) : ( i ) the parameter space of the dark matter halo models does not vary with the spatial sampling of their rc , ( ii ) the relative fit quality of the three halo models does not vary with resolution , and ( iii ) the @xmath27 values increase from s1 to s2 and then decrease for s3 , which generally exhibits the smallest @xmath27 . to illustrate , the fits of the nfw , iso and einasto halos to the rc of the andromeda galaxy lead to a reduced @xmath28 for s1 ( sampling of @xmath29200 pc ) , @xmath30 for s2 ( a sampling of @xmath29400 pc , as in tab . 5 of @xcite , for their `` hybrid '' model ) and @xmath31 for s3 ( sampling of @xmath29800 pc ) .",
    "for this galaxy , the fit parameters of the nfw halo , the characteristic velocity @xmath32 and the halo concentration @xmath33 , are @xmath34 km s@xmath35  and @xmath36 for s1 , @xmath37 km s@xmath35  and @xmath38 for s2 , @xmath39 km s@xmath35  and @xmath40 for s3 , indeed independent of the sampling .",
    "the non - independent rotation velocities in s1 are thus responsible for the smaller @xmath27 compared to s2 , whereas the larger sampling interval explains the smaller @xmath27 for model s3 .",
    "the risk of using large intervals ( like s3 ) is , of course , that one starts loosing small - scale details in the rotation curve and decreases the velocity gradient in the inner parts of the galaxies .     from mass models",
    "fit to things rcs from d08 and from this study , with the iso ( _ open diamonds _ ) and nfw ( _ closed diamonds _ ) , using the kroupa ( _ green _ ) and diet - salpeter ( _ purple _ ) imfs . ]    we therefore conclude that the optimum sampling of rcs for mass models of galaxies is one which avoids non - independent velocities generating artificially small @xmath27 , and which preserves an appropriate spatial resolution that does not smooth out small - scale details in the rc , especially in the inner regions , which are the most sensitive to the differences between the iso , nfw and einasto models .",
    "we have thus modeled the mass distributions of the things galaxies from rcs with the s2 sampling , i.e. , with galactocentric radii separated by one synthesized beam size .    note",
    "that the conclusions given in d08 still hold : the halo parameters we have fit are similar to theirs , the iso model usually provides better results than the nfw model .",
    "only the values of the reduced @xmath27 have increased when going from non - independent to independent velocities , as shown in figure  [ fig : veloind ] .",
    "finally , because the analysis of individual differences between the nfw and iso halos is beyond the scope of this article , we refer the reader to tab .",
    "[ tab : resfit1 ] and  [ tab : resfit2 ] for the resulting halo parameters and to d08 for further discussion .",
    "figures  [ fig : rc - salpeter ] and  [ fig : rc - kroupa ] show the decomposition of the rcs into baryonic and dark matter components for the einasto model .",
    "the fit parameters and their associated @xmath41 error , as well as the reduced chi - squared values , @xmath42 , are given in tabs  [ tab : resfit1 ] and  [ tab : resfit2 ] for the einasto , nfw and iso halos .",

    "in this section , we investigate the significance of the improvement of the rc fits with the einasto halo over those with the iso and nfw models .",
    "we first analyze the number of fits that are statistically significant with the einasto model and that were not significant with any of the two - parameter iso and nfw models . by `` statistically significant '' we mean that a model and the observations follow the same distribution , i.e. , that there is less than 5% probability of obtaining as good a fit by chance according to chi - squared statistics .",
    "for the kroupa imf , the fraction of the fits that were not significant with the iso model , but are with the einasto halo consists of 30% of the sample ( 6 out of 20 fits ) .",
    "this fraction becomes 25% when going from nfw to einasto .",
    "for the diet - salpeter imf , only two galaxies ( 10% ) have gone from a not significant result with the iso model to significant with the einasto halo , while it is @xmath57 from nfw to einasto ( 4 galaxies ) .",
    "though these numbers do not represent the majority of the sample , they are not negligible . as a comparison",
    ", @xmath58 ( @xmath57 ) of the sample acquires significant fits when passing from nfw to iso for the kroupa ( respectively diet - salpeter ) imf .",
    "therefore , the improvement of fitting the  rcs by the einasto model instead of the iso or nfw models is equal to or better than the improvement implied when switching from nfw to iso .",
    "conversely , the einasto model does not diminish the significance of the fits : no fit has turned from being significant with iso / nfw to not significant with the einasto halo , regardless of the imf .",
    "however , it is not surprising that the three - parameter einasto model is better able to reproduce the rcs than the two - parameter iso and nfw models . because neither iso nor nfw models are nested parameters is considered nested in a more complex model with e.g. , @xmath59 parameters when fixing one of the @xmath59 parameters allows one to reproduce the simplest @xmath60 parameter model .",
    "] into the einasto family of models , we can not simply perform an @xmath61-test to check for the significance of the improvement of the fits with the three - parameter einasto model . instead",
    ", we verify the significance of this improvement by performing akaike information criterion tests ( hereafter , aic , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are designed to compare non - nested models of different numbers of parameters .",
    "the goal of an aic test is not to statistically reject one model with respect to another , but rather to find the model that is more likely to be correct .",
    "the criterion is expressed as aic @xmath62 , where @xmath1 is the number of parameters of the model .",
    "an einasto model is considered more likely to be correct than the iso or nfw model when @xmath63 .",
    "we find that 65% ( 60% ) of the fits with the einasto model are more likely to be correct than those with the iso model assuming a kroupa ( diet - salpeter ) imf .",
    "these percentages increase to 95% when comparing with the nfw model , independent of the assumed imf .    in summary ,",
    "the einasto model provides more fits that are statistically significant and is more likely to be correct than the two other models . for these reasons",
    ", we conclude that fitting rcs of the current things sample with an einasto halo is a significant improvement with respect to the nfw and iso models .",
    "figures  [ fig : haloparam1 ] and  [ fig : haloparam2 ] show the fit parameters for the diet - salpeter and kroupa imfs , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : histoindex ] shows the distribution of einasto indices .",
    "based on these distributions , we can distinguish several families of halos .",
    "a first family of halos has well constrained parameters with large indices ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "we refer to this family as cuspy einasto halos hereafter .",
    "indeed it corresponds to halos whose indices are comparable with the index of a typical galaxy - sized halo from numerical simulations ( @xmath65 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their innermost density slopes are steeper than @xmath66 , hence consistent with cosmological slopes ( @xmath67 , * ? ? ?",
    "a second family of galaxies has well - constrained parameters with low index values ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "it contains the majority of the galaxies .",
    "a third halo family has very low indices ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "most of those fits occur with the diet - salpeter imf .",
    "finally a fourth family of halos has unrealistic , extremely large scale radii , with large associated uncertainties ( the rising part of the rc of ngc  7793 , ngc  7331 , ngc  2976 ) .",
    "those fits are extremely degenerate , which is very likely caused by an almost complete dominance of the baryonic material over the dark component , at least for ngc  2976 and ngc  7331",
    ".    figures  [ fig : haloparam1 ] and  [ fig : haloparam2 ] show a clear relation linking the characteristic density to the radius .",
    "small halos are denser than large ones .",
    "a power - law fit to the observed relationship gives @xmath70 for both imfs .",
    "this implies that the surface density of dark matter @xmath71 derived at @xmath4 scales as @xmath72 .",
    "those relations have been determined without taking account the fourth halo family fits and by averaging the fit parameters of galaxies that have duplicated rcs but a different stellar decomposition ( ngc  2403 and ngc  3198 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the correlation we find between the scale density and radius of the einasto model differs from the relations found between the scale density and radius of two - parameter nfw and iso models .",
    "for instance @xcite and @xcite have derived a relation @xmath73 ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where the scale density @xmath74 and and @xmath75 are the characteristic density and radius of two - parameter nfw and iso models . as a consequence",
    "the dark matter surface density @xmath76 remains roughly constant at the core radius of the halo @xcite .",
    "this trend is not observed with the einasto halo . in this context , it is interesting to note that we have also fit the two - parameter iso model to the current sample ( iso column in tabs .",
    "[ tab : resfit1 ] and  [ tab : resfit2 ] ) .",
    "the results do not imply a similar relation as in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite , but agree more with @xcite .",
    "we indeed find inner surface densities for the core halo that depend on the scale parameters . a linear fit yields @xmath77 for the diet - salpeter imf and @xmath78 for the kroupa imf .",
    "it may seem odd that these results disagree with @xcite because part of their sample consists of the current things galaxies ( though using the d08 rcs ) .",
    "a possible explanation of the difference could be the choice of stellar mass - to - light ratios ( @xcite use best fit mass - to - light ratios ) , the use of other kinematical tracers ( mostly the ionized gas ) as well as the choice of the outer slope of the density profile of dark matter ( @xmath79 in @xcite and @xcite , while our iso model implies @xmath80 ) .",
    "a detailed investigation of both analysis methods is beyond the scope of this article . clearly though , the implied ( non-)constancy of the dark matter surface density warrants further investigation .        as for the einasto index ,",
    "we note the more scattered distribution and the presence of more halos having a small index for the diet - salpeter imf than for the kroupa imf .",
    "this is caused by a larger contribution of stellar baryons to the rcs .",
    "the effect of a ( very ) low index ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rceinasto ] as declining velocities in the outer parts of the dark matter halo ) are clearly visible for ngc  4736 , ngc  6946 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rc - salpeter ] , diet - salpeter imf only ) and ngc  925 ( figs .  [",

    "in the previous section we have studied two - parameter , fixed index einasto halos that were consistent with cdm , but noted they were not consistent with the observations . in this section ,",
    "we try to identify other two - parameter einasto halos and ask whether there are any einasto models that can describe the observed halos better than the iso or nfw halo models . before answering these questions",
    ", we emphasize that our galaxy sample does not pretend to be representative of the whole diversity of spiral galaxies in the local universe . nevertheless , in this section , we aim at finding a family of generic einasto halos that reproduce fairly well the rcs of things spiral galaxies , at least as good as the usual core or cosmological cuspy models .",
    "we estimate the critical index value where the nfw halo becomes better than the einasto halo for the majority of the current sample .",
    "we find @xmath171 for the diet - salpeter imf and @xmath172 for the kroupa imf .",
    "those values have been derived by increasing progressively the ( fixed ) index in the fits and by identifying the turnover index where more than half of the nfw fits from the sample becomes better than the einasto fits .",
    "note that those models represent halos which are less and less dense , and larger as the index increases .",
    "another advantage of these models with respect to the nfw model is the better agreement with @xmath0cdm simulations .",
    "we repeat the same procedure but towards smaller indices and find @xmath173 ( diet - salpeter imf ) and @xmath174 ( kroupa imf ) as the values where the majority of constrained einasto fits turn better than nfw ones .",
    "this result is completely expected because small indices provide core halos , whose halo shape is naturally better for the sample than any cusp .",
    "in contrast with the cuspy halos , we find the cored ( @xmath175 ) halos at the low end of the einasto index distribution .",
    "we investigate the goodness of fit of two - parameter einasto models performed with a fixed , small index to find a critical index where the majority of such constrained einasto fits become worse than those performed with the iso model .",
    "it turns out a low limit can not be obtained for the diet - salpeter imf ; the iso model is always a better fit than the constrained einasto model at a level of @xmath2970% , which is likely explained by the relatively scattered index distribution , as seen in  [ sec : nonuniversality ] . in other words",
    "it is almost impossible to find an index that would satisfy most of all halos at the same time for that imf .",
    "it is not the case for the kroupa imf for which @xmath176 indicates the turnover index . indeed , 65% , 55% and 45% of all the sample is better fit by the iso model than @xmath177",
    ", @xmath178 and @xmath11 ( respectively ) einasto fits .",
    "notice this value appears consistent with the mean index @xmath179 of non - cuspy halos fit under the kroupa imf assumption (  [ sec : nonuniversality ] ) .    for larger indices",
    "@xmath180 is the limit where most of constrained einasto fits become worse than iso ones . past this value ,",
    "the core nature of the iso model starts to dominate the cuspy nature of these einasto halos .",
    "the index range @xmath181 of constrained einasto core models is therefore small compared with that of constrained einasto cusps .      both results of  [ sec : twoparam1 ] and  [ sec : twoparam2 ] make us conclude that the family of two - parameter einasto models with @xmath182 is more suited for the modeling of observational cuspy halos than is the nfw model , whereas the einasto model with @xmath183 is more suited for the modeling of cored halos than is the isothermal model .",
    "while allowing the variation of the einasto index is essential in finding the best fit models to the things rcs (  [ sec : comparisoneinastoisonfw ] ,  [ sec : halofamily ] and  [ sec : compsimu ] ) , those fits at fixed indices point out the exponential shape of the density profile also contributes in better modeling the mass distribution of the galaxies .",
    "we thus suggest that a new shape of dark matter density , where the volumic density profile decreases exponentially as a function of radius following eq .  [",
    "eq : rhoeinasto ] , may be a good alternative to the usual mass divergent , pseudo - isothermal and nfw models , with einasto indices chosen to match the particular type of halo ( core or cusp ) one wants to model .",
    "for the first time , the einasto dark matter halo has been applied to model the mass distribution of nearby and undisturbed galactic disks .",
    "our results show that the einasto model is a good fit of the dark matter contribution to highly - resolved  rotation curves of galaxies , better than other models like the ( cored ) iso model or the ( cuspy ) nfw model .",
    "the significant improvement is caused by the parameter that shapes the radial behaviour of the mass density profile , the einasto index .",
    "the big advantage of the einasto formalism over the nfw cusp or the pseudo - isothermal sphere lies on its third parameter , the index , which allows for extra freedom in describing different shapes of density profiles .",
    "the larger ( respectively , smaller ) is the einasto index , the cuspier ( shallower ) is the halo in its central parts .",
    "since there is no unique index describing all halos , it is not possible to scale the density profile from one galaxy to another with a different mass . in other words",
    ", we find no evidence for a universal dark matter einasto halo , at least in the galaxy sample we have analyzed .",
    "this result corroborates the one found in dissipationless @xmath0cdm simulations .",
    "noteworthy however is the fact that the index appears to scale with the halo mass for halos more massive than @xmath136 @xmath13 .",
    "we find that the einasto index is generally smaller than the one inferred from cosmological simulations , by a factor of two or more .",
    "this discrepancy between observed and simulated einasto indices extends the core - cusp controversy ( iso versus nfw ) to the einasto formalism . a @xmath0cdm einasto halo is cuspier than an observed galactic einasto halo . in our sample ,",
    "galaxies with a cuspy ( i.e. with @xmath64 ) einasto halo are not frequent .",
    "it is interesting to note that our sample consists of both normal , bright galaxies and of a few dwarf , low surface density galaxies , while the cusp - core controversy usually deals with small and low surface density galaxies only .",
    "cored dark matter halos are thus found in galaxies whose baryonic content significantly differs , for halos less massive than @xmath136 @xmath13 .",
    "the rc decomposition has also shown that cuspy einasto halos with fixed index @xmath182 give a better description of rcs than does the nfw model",
    ". conversely core einasto models with fixed index @xmath181 give better rc fits than the iso model .",
    "it implies that the exponential decrease of the einasto dark matter density is also responsible for the improvement in modeling the mass distribution of galaxies , in addition to the effect of the einasto index .",
    "those constrained einasto models can be a good alternative to iso or nfw models for galactic dynamics , but we re - iterate here that einasto models with free index are preferable over any of those two - parameter models .    the analysis has shown that the stellar masses derived with the @xcite prescription under a diet - salpeter imf hypothesis are in conflict with the einasto model .",
    "this is not the case for the kroupa imf . in future papers from this series",
    ", we will perform mass models with free stellar masses and with other fixed stellar mass scalings , like the one described in @xcite .",
    "additional improvements of dynamical models will take into account the molecular gas content , where available .",
    "furthermore we will investigate possible correlations between the properties of einasto dark matter halos and baryons .",
    "the mass distribution for a large sample of low surface density disks will also be studied .",
    "we expect that those galaxies exhibit low einasto indices because of the shallow nature of the density profile in their core , but to which extent their values compare with those of normal , higher surface brightness disks like most of our current things subsample is not known yet .",
    "both these samples will help us to measure the variation of dark halo inner shape as a function of galaxy mass .",
    "we finally emphasize the importance of testing the einasto halo model for objects at extreme ends of the galaxy luminosity function ( dwarf spheroidals and giant ellipticals ) .",
    "this will be crucial for getting a complete description of the observational behaviour of einasto models over several decades of halo mass and comparing with expectations from @xmath0cdm simulations at similar cosmological scales .",
