    "the nucleosynthesis of this burning is called the rapid - proton ( rp ) process @xcite . in the stage of stellar explosive burning of hydrogen , a great quantity of proton capture reactions and @xmath9-decays ( rp - process ) will be ignited for those of nuclear mass number @xmath10 .",
    "the rp - process might be one of the most important mechanisms for energy production and nucleosynthesis in a variety of astrophysical and pivotal sites with different temperature and density conditions .    according to the stellar evolution theory , for sufficient high temperature in the ne - na cycle , the timescale of the proton capture reaction of @xmath0 mg is shorter than that of the @xmath9-decay",
    ". therefore , some @xmath0 mg will kindle and escape from the ne - na cycle by proton capture .",
    "the @xmath0 mg leaks from the ne - na cycle into the mg - al cycle and results in the synthesis of a large amount of heavy nuclei .",

    "the nuclear reaction rate of @xmath0 mg @xmath1 @xmath2al has been studied by many previous works . by considering the contribution of a single resonance energy state ,",
    "@xcite firstly discussed the reaction rate of @xmath0 mg @xmath1 @xmath2al .",

    "@xcite also carried out an estimation for the rate based on some new experimental information on @xmath2al excitation energies .",
    "whereas , above of them seem to have overlooked one important influence of electron screening on nuclear reaction .",
    "the strong electron screening ( ses ) has always been a challenging problem on the stellar weak - interaction rates and thermonuclear reaction rates in pre - supernova stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis .",

    "? what role does the ses play in magnetars ?",
    "these problems are interesting for us to understand the physical mechanism of ses in dense stars , especially for magnetars .",

    "the momentum space of the electron gas is changed very asymmetrically by so large smfs .",
    "the electron fermi energy and nuclear reaction are also affected greatly by smfs in magnetars . in this paper , according to the relativistic theory in smfs @xcite , we carried out an estimation on the ses and electron energy change due to the influence of smfs .",
    "we also discuss how to effects on the thermonuclear reaction by three ses models on the surface of magnetars .",
    "our work differs from earlier works ( ld and fgp)@xcite in which we derive new results for the ses theory in an smfs and the screening rates for nuclear reaction in relativistic strongly magnetic field surrounding basing on the dirac @xmath14-function and pauli exclusion principle .",
    "we also make detailed comparison among the results for the nuclear reaction rates of different ses model in smfs .",
    "the main problems , we investigated are how magnetic fields influence the electron fermi energy and electron screening potential then enters the theory of nuclear reaction rates .",
    "we show that this effect can increase nuclear reaction rates by several orders magnitude .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",

    "their expression for the degeneracy electron of the @xmath33-th landau level in a relativistic magnetic field is completely took the place of that for the corresponding non - relativistic case .",
    "therefore , @xcite obtained that the electron fermi energy @xmath230 , can be decreased with increasing of magnetic field strength in superstrong magnetic field environment ( i.e. @xmath231 ) . basing on above theory , we study the esp and the ses model ( ld s model ) .",
    "the results show that the esp will decrease with increasing of magnetic fields due to the diminution of electron chemical potential .",
    "maybe it lead to a different inevitable influence on ses in smfs .    on the other hand ,",
    "the electron chemical potential is a pivotal parameter , which is closely related to the electron number density and exchange energy . basing on thomas - fermi - dirac approximation ,",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath232 where @xmath233 is the exchange energy and @xmath234 can be find in ref .",
    "@xcite . using the linear response theory",
    ", @xcite discussed the exchange energy and electron chemical potential in the lowest landau level for non - uniformity electron gas due to smfs .",
    "they analyzed the ses problem in smfs and their results shown that due to smfs only the lowest landau level is occupied on the condition of @xmath235 or equivalently @xmath236(a / z)@xmath237 by electrons .",
    "the cyclotron radius in the lowest landau level orbital is give by @xmath238 .",
    "but for the free electron gas fgp used the expression of @xmath239 when they deal with @xmath240 . in fgp s model",
    ", they think at high density the exchange correction is very small , thus they neglect the exchange correction to @xmath240 and have @xmath241 in smfs . due to deal with exchange correction under this condition , the sef of fgp model has some difference to compare with other ses models .",
    "basing on previous works ( @xcite ) , which considered the quantum effects in smfs , by introducing the dirac @xmath14-function and pauli exclusion principle , we discuss dirac equation and the quantization of landau levels of electrons under the relativistic conditions in smfs .",
    "the results show that the stronger the magnetic field , the higher fermi energy of electrons in smfs becomes .",
    "according relativistic theory in smfs , we detailed evaluate the ses problem and esp by taking into account the quantum effects .",
    "the results show that the esp can increase and gets to the maximum value of 0.1 mev by smfs .",
    "the sef also increases greatly and even gets to the maximum value of five by smfs ( e.g. @xmath242 g ) .",
    "it is well known that , in explosive hydrogen burning stellar environments , the nuclear reaction @xmath0mg@xmath11@xmath2al plays a key role for breaking out of the ne - na cycle to heavy nuclear species ( i.e. mg - al cycle ) .",
    "therefore , it is very important for accurate determinate the rates for the reaction @xmath0mg@xmath243@xmath2al .",
    "however , the resonance energy has a large uncertainty due to the inconsistent @xmath2mg(@xmath244he , t)@xmath2al measurements mentioned . and",
    "it may lead to a factor of 5 variation in the reaction rate at @xmath245 because of its exponential dependence on @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "therefore , some author discussed in detail the contributions from several important resonance states , such as @xcite . in order to reduce the uncertainty of the reaction rates in this paper",
    ", we reference some information about this reaction and the values of the @xmath246 and corresponding to @xmath247 and some average values of @xmath151 are adopted and listed in table 2 .",
    "according to these information , we analysis the total rates for these five ses model .",
    "* figure 7 * shows the comparison of total resonant rates as a function of @xmath149 in the case without ses with those of the ses models of liolios , dewitt , and ld , fgp , lj .",
    "one can see that different ses models have different effect on the resonant rates .",
    "the calculated rates show that our model will be dominant status compared with those of other models at relatively low density ( e.g. @xmath192 ) and the rates will get to the maximum of @xmath248 at @xmath249 . on the contrary , the rates of ld s model will always be the lesser value and the maximum is about @xmath250 at @xmath251 .",
    "the rates of fgp s model increase with increasing of density and temperature in smfs and even increase to @xmath252 .",
    "the total resonant rates and the rates for four part resonance states as a function of @xmath253 for different ses model are showed in * figure 8*. the calculations of @xmath254 @xmath255 and the @xmath256 are the rates of four part resonance states and the total resonance rates in the case without ses and smfs , respectively .",
    "the results show that the contributions of the four resonant to the total reaction rate have obvious difference at the stellar temperatures range of @xmath257 . with increasing of temperatures ,",
    "the rates are very sensitive to the stellar temperatures and increases quickly .",
    "one can find that the contribution of resonance state of @xmath258kev is dominates to the total reaction rates when @xmath259 , but the @xmath260kev resonance is the most important at high temperatures when @xmath261 and the rates will get to the maximum of 296.4 at @xmath262 . on the contrary , the @xmath263kev as well as @xmath264kev resonance are negligible compared to the former two lower resonance over the whole temperature range .",
    "the rates of ld s model only have rarely related to density and always are less than the rates @xmath265 except for @xmath266 in * figure 8*. due to ses in smfs the rates of ld decrease about @xmath267 to compare with @xmath265 . however , the rates of fgp s model increase about @xmath268 due to ses in smfs . as increasing of density , temperature and magnetic field",

    ". however , the factor for fgp s model gets to the maximum of 0.5478 at @xmath272 .",
    "the factor of our model also increases greatly with increasing of the magnetic field and gets to the maximum of 0.9 at @xmath203 , @xmath273 , @xmath209 .",
    "table 3 and 4 give a brief description of the factor @xmath274 @xmath275 for ld s , fgp s , and lj s models when @xmath276 , respectively .",
    "with increasing of density and temperature , the results of ld s model are in good agreement with those of fgp , but disagreement with our results at @xmath277 .",
    "this is because that the electron fermi energy of our model is lower than those of ld and fgp in relatively low magnetic field environment .",
    "however , when the magnetic field increases from @xmath277 to @xmath278 , factor @xmath279 increases about @xmath280 orders magnitude ( i.e. from 0.1749 to 25.5680 and from 0.0022 to 3.8848 ) when @xmath281 and @xmath282 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath214 factor @xmath279 ( our model ) is about 39.74 , 5.69 , 1.56 times larger than @xmath283 ( fgp s model ) at @xmath284 , @xmath285 and @xmath282 , respectively . from what has been discussed above , we find the ld s model is only adapted to the relatively low magnetic field and low density surroundings .",
    "furthermore , the fgp s and ld s model are both unadapted to relatively low density , and high magnetic field surroundings ( e.g. @xmath286 ) .",
    "however , our model can be well adapted to relatively high magnetic field and low density surroundings ( e.g. @xmath287 ) in the crust of magnetar .",
    "our calculated rates are compared with those of ld and fgp by the factor @xmath288 @xmath289 in * figure 10*. we find that our results are in good agreement with those of ld and fgp at relatively low density ( i.e. @xmath203 ) for @xmath290 .",
    "however , the rates of our model can be 1.58 times larger than those of fgp for @xmath214 , @xmath203 , @xmath200 . and",
    "can be around three orders of magnitude larger than those of ld for @xmath214 , @xmath291 , @xmath292 .",
    "summing up the above discussion , our work differs from earlier works ( ld and fgp ) in that we derive new results for the ses theory in an smfs and the rates for nuclear reaction , which we use in the ses theory calculations in relativistic strongly magnetic field surrounding basing on the the dirac @xmath293-function and pauli exclusion principle .",
    "we also make detailed comparison among the results for the nuclear reaction rates of different ses model in smfs .",
    "we correct the traditional popular viewpoint about the fermi energy in smfs ( i.e. @xmath294 ) , which have been derived by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "their opinion shows that the stronger the magnetic fields , the lower the electron fermi energy becomes .",
    "the main problems we investigate are how magnetic fields affect the electron fermi energy and electron screening potential that enters the theory of nuclear reaction rates .",
    "we show that this effect can increase nuclear reaction rates of @xmath0 mg @xmath1@xmath2al by several orders magnitude . a more precise thermonuclear rates of @xmath0",
    "mg @xmath1@xmath2al will help us to constrain the determination of nuclear flow out of the ne - na cycle , and production of @xmath295 nuclides , in explosive hydrogen burning over a temperature range @xmath296 gk .",
    "as everyone knows , the progenitor double neutron star systems have long been known to exist @xcite .",
    "the merging of two neutron stars ( ns - ns ) or black hole and neutron star ( bh - ns ) that make up a binary system is of interest both because it is a powerful source of gravitational waves and because it might be the central engine of gamma - ray bursts . @xcite and @xcite first discussed the binary compact object model for merging neutron stars , which is regarded as possible sources of gamma ray burst .",
    "the merger of a neutron star with a black hole also investigated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some works about hydrodynamical numerical simulation of the merging of ns - ns or bh - ns also have been carried out by @xcite .",
    "their researches show that the problem on nucleosynthesis is a very interesting and challenging issue . in the process of merger ,",
    "a good deal of heavy elements ( e.g. @xmath8al ) , produced from the nucleosynthesis process , may be thrown out to interstellar space . therefore",
    ", our results may help us understand why some elements ( e.g. @xmath8al ) is overabundance and our works may have important significance to the future investigations of the change of element abound of interstellar space and evolution of magnetars .",
    "basing on the relativistic theory in smfs , we investigate the problem of ses , and the influence on the nuclear reaction of @xmath0 mg @xmath1@xmath2al by ld s , fgp s , and lj s strong screening models in smfs .",
    "we also analyse the landau energy level and the electron fermi energy in details due to the effects of smfs .",
    "the results show that the effects of ses on the thermonuclear reaction rates are remarkable in smfs .",
    "the rates can be increased by around three orders of magnitude .",
    "and the rates of our model are in good agreement with those of ld and fgp at relatively low density and magnetic fields ( e.g. @xmath3 ) for @xmath297 . in relatively low magnetic fields ( e.g. @xmath298 ) ,",
    "the ses of ld s and fgp s model has strong influence on the rates of nuclear reaction to compare to our model .",
    "however , the rates of our model can be about 1.58 times and three orders magnitude higher than those of fgp and ld in relatively high magnetic fields and low density surroundings ( e.g. @xmath299 , @xmath300 ) , respectively .    on the other hand",
    ", one can conclude that our calculated rates increase greatly and even exceed by three orders magnitude at the same density and temperature with increasing of smfs .",
    "for example , when @xmath19 increases from 10 to @xmath278 , the rates increase from 0.1749 to 25.5680 at @xmath281 , and from 0.0022 to 3.8848 at @xmath282 .",
    "the considerable increase of the reaction rates for @xmath0 mg @xmath1 @xmath2al implies that more @xmath0 mg will escape the ne - na cycle due to ses in smfs",
    ". then it will make the next reaction convert more @xmath2al @xmath301 @xmath2 mg to participate in the mg - al cycle .",
    "it may lead to synthesize a large amount of heavy elements ( e.g. @xmath8al ) at the crust of magnetars .",
    "these heavy elements ( e.g. @xmath8al ) , which are produce from the nucleosynthesis process , may be thrown out due to the compact binary mergers of double neutron star ( ns - ns ) or black hole and neutron star ( bh and ns ) systems . thereby the results , we derived",
    "may help to understand why the @xmath8al is always overabundance in the interstellar space .",
    "however , the problem of the overabundance of @xmath8al in interstellar matter needs much more efforts to consider the influence by many factors ( such as the resonant energy , nuclear reaction pathway , element abundance , the density , and the temperature , as well as the strength of magnetic fields ) .",
    "these problems will be our next issues to discuss .    in summary , we describe our analytical results about the ses theory in smfs and obtain some information of the screened rates by calculating the sef on the surface of magnetars .",
    "it may improve our understanding of the thermal evolution and thermal spectrum of magnetars .",
    "however , the problem about the effects of ses in smfs on the nuclear reaction is always a challenging topic , which is interesting to many astrophysicists due to the fact that the sef is related to the esp , density , temperature and strength of magnetic fields in different ses model and surroundings .",
    "these discrepancies may produce important and profound influence on the nuclear reaction pathway , nucleosynthesis for some heavy nuclei , and the energy generation rate , as well as the element abundance on the surface of magnetars .",
    "hence , our research may become a good foundation for the future investigation of the evolution and numerical simulation of magnetars , and may be important significance to future research on nuclear astrophysics .",

    "<S> basing on the relativistic theory in superstrong magnetic fields ( smfs ) , we investigate the influence of strong electron screening ( ses ) on the rates of nuclear reaction @xmath0 mg @xmath1 @xmath2al by three models of lai ( ld ) , fushiki et al . </S>",

    "<S> our results show that the rates can be greatly enhanced by three orders of magnitude due to the influence of ses . </S>",
    "<S> the rates in our model are in good agreement with those of ld and fgp at relatively low density environment ( e.g. @xmath3 ) for @xmath4 . on the other hand , in relatively high magnetic fields ( e.g. @xmath5 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the rates of our model can be 1.58 times and around three orders of magnitude larger than those of fgp and ld , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the significant increase of the rates of our model for @xmath0 mg @xmath1 @xmath2al implies that more @xmath0 mg will escape from the ne - na cycle due to ses in smfs . as a consequence , the next reaction @xmath2al </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 @xmath2 mg will produce more @xmath2 mg to participate in the mg - al cycle . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it may lead to synthesize a large amount of production of @xmath7 nuclides ( e.g. @xmath8al ) on the surface of magnetars . </S>",
    "<S> these heavy elements ( e.g. @xmath8al ) may be thrown out due to the compact binary mergers of double neutron star ( ns - ns ) or black hole and neutron star ( bh and ns ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> our results may help to understand why the @xmath8al is always overabundance in the interstellar space . </S>",
    "<S> our conclusion may be helpful to the investigation of the nucleosynthesis of some heavy elements , the energy generation rate , and the numerical calculations of magnetars evolution . </S>"
