    "relativistic fluids play an important role in many areas of modern cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "they are widely used for the description of various kinds of cosmological species . as an example",
    ", the standard big bang cosmological model ( @xmath0cdm ) contains non - clustering dark energy in the form of a small positive cosmological constant @xmath1 together with cold dark matter considered as a perfect fluid with zero pressure .",
    "the standard model fits well to the supernovae data @xcite , baryon acoustic oscillations surveys @xcite and measurements of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "more complicated models are also developed to avoid such theoretical problems of @xmath0cdm cosmology as fine - tuning and coincidences problems .",
    "these are primarily the models with dynamic dark energy ( see @xcite for a review ) and cosmological models on the basis of modified theories of gravity ( a recent review can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "generalized models of dark matter alone are also of interest .",
    "there are several different approaches to cosmological perfect fluids . a promising way of describing a perfect relativistic fluid is outlined by the pull - back formalism @xcite and the effective field theory for hydrodynamics @xcite . in these closely related techniques , a barotropic perfect fluid can be described by a set of three non - canonical scalar fields satisfying certain symmetry conditions @xcite .",
    "the advantage of these formalisms is the ability to write a perfect fluid action in simple and convenient form that offers great possibilities for generalizations .",
    "for example , the effective field theory allows to describe a charged fluid @xcite .",
    "currently , both approaches are evolving to account for a range of dissipative effects @xcite .",
    "cosmological applications of the variational principle for fluids ( and solids ) were first considered in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the corresponding formalism has been used to constrain possible deviations from lorentz invariance in dark matter .",
    "it was applied to propose and investigate new classes of inflationary models @xcite as well as new form of possible coupling between dark matter and quintessence @xcite .",
    "the cosmological effective field theory of multi - component fluids has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the brown s formulation of the variational principle for relativistic fluids ( with lagrangian multipliers ) @xcite currently is intensively employed in new multi - fluid @xcite and scalar - fluid theories@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate some cosmological effects of higher derivative corrections to the action of perfect fluid within the framework of the effective field theory .",
    "a sample of such corrections has been considered in the minkowski background in @xcite . in a cosmological context , the effective theory of fluids at next - to - leading order in derivatives and implications for dark energy have been explored in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ] ,",
    "we review the formalism used in the analysis and present our model .",
    "the background solutions are investigated in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "the section [ sec:4 ] contains the perturbed einstein equations for scalar linear perturbations about spatially flat flrw background .",
    "we examine also the conditions of the absence of instabilities in radiation - dominated and matter - dominated eras . in section [ sec:5 ] , the evolution of perturbations is studied in the toy model and , by numerical methods , in a more realistic model with baryonic matter .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "let us briefly review some basic concepts and results of effective field theory for hydrodynamics .",
    "initially , this formalism has been developed as the theory of phonons in a continuous medium @xcite .",
    "it has been applied also to rederiving , in a field theory language , some findings of the pull - back formalism @xcite , which is based on earlier formulations of the variational principle for fluids @xcite .",
    "here we mainly follow the papers @xcite .    in continuum mechanics , the central role plays the concept of fluid element .",
    "a fluid element is always situated at the same fluid point moving with the velocity of the flow @xcite .",
    "the fluid points can be marked with three labels @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , which are usually chosen to be a fluid point coordinates at some initial time . at any time @xmath4 the coordinates of the fluid element are given by @xmath5 .",
    "this equation thus defines the trajectory of the fluid element and corresponds to a lagrangian description of the fluid motion .",
    "the inverse mapping @xmath6 gives the labels of the fluid point that is located at spatial point @xmath7 at the moment @xmath4 .",
    "in other words , the mapping ( [ comovmap ] ) provides an eulerian representation of fluid flow .",
    "once the labels are being attached to the fluid points , they do not change under space - time coordinate transformations .",
    "hence , the functions @xmath8 are scalar fields from the observer s point of view .",
    "the three - dimensional space of fluids points and the spatial space are isomorphic , that allows to consider the map ( [ comovmap ] ) as the transformation to a coordinate system in which the fluid is at rest .",
    "therefore , the fields @xmath9 can be treated as the comoving coordinates of the fluid .",
    "this leads to the orthogonality condition ( @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the proper time ) @xmath12    the action of any physical theory which uses fields @xmath8 should not depend on the ambiguity of its definition .",
    "in particular , the action of the system should not be changed within internal shifts and rotations : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and the matrix entries @xmath15 are constant .",
    "in addition , to distinguish a fluid from an isotropic solid , we require the invariance under volume preserving transformations @xmath16      the invariance under internal translations ( [ symmetry1 ] ) implies that the lagrangian is a function of the quantities @xmath17 and their partial derivatives . at lowest order in the derivative expansion , it will involve only one derivative acting on each field @xmath2 .",
    "then the lorentz invariance leads to the fact that the lowest order lagrangian should be built from the set of scalar quantities @xmath18 that form a matrix @xmath19 .",
    "there is only one independent function of entries of any @xmath20 matrix , namely its determinant , which is invariant under the internal transformations ( [ symmetry2 ] ) , ( [ symmetry3 ] ) @xcite .",
    "hence , the low - order action consistent with the imposed symmetries is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a generic function and @xmath23 from the viewpoint of field theory , this action is interpreted as a low - energy one @xcite .",
    "the orthogonality conditions ( [ ort ] ) can be resolved to give @xcite @xmath24 where the levi - civita symbol @xmath25 is defined by @xmath26 , and we use the usual normalization @xmath27 it is worth noting that the four - velocity @xmath28 is invariant to an arbitrary internal diffeomorphism @xcite .",
    "we define the energy - momentum tensor as @xmath29 that gives for the low - order action ( [ action_bf ] ) @xmath30    in view of equations ( [ ort ] ) and ( [ velocity ] ) , this is the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid @xmath31 whose energy density and pressure are given by @xcite @xmath32    hence , the action ( [ action_bf ] ) describes a barotropic perfect fluid with the equation of state @xmath33 where @xmath34    the dust has zero pressure @xmath35 , that leads to @xmath36 .",
    "the radiation fluid is described by @xmath37 .",
    "generally , the power law dependence of the function @xmath38 corresponds to the case of barotropic fluid with a constant parameter of state @xmath39 .    within",
    "the reviewed above formalism there is conserved current @xmath40 this vector field satisfies the identity @xcite @xmath41 where semicolon indicates covariant differentiation .",
    "the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be identified with the entropy current and the entropy density correspondingly @xcite .",
    "the theory outlined above has been purely classical .",
    "the classical treatment of the effective field theory should be applicable on scales of the order of @xmath44 or longer , where @xmath0 is some positive constant .",
    "we assume that a cut - off parameter @xmath1 is smaller than the planck mass @xmath45 , but large enough to cover all relevant cosmological scales . to be able to neglect quantum fluctuations , the scalar fields @xmath2 would be sufficiently smooth @xcite : @xmath46    this inequality allows us to use a derivative expansion and write the action of the theory in the form @xcite @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a small dimensionless parameter .",
    "it is assumed usually that all dimensionless parameters ( except @xmath25 ) in the function @xmath49 are of order one .",
    "this last assumption is very strong in some cases , we are not imposing it here .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that a derivative expansion of @xmath49 is uniformly convergent at sufficiently smooth @xmath2 . in",
    "what follows we will work in units where @xmath50 .",
    "consider now possible corrections to the lagrangian of a barotropic perfect fluid .",
    "we will constraint the great variety of possible additional terms by the assumption that our field theory will contain no derivatives of scalar fields @xmath2 higher than second order . within the framework of fluid description",
    ", such terms can be constructed from hydrodynamic variables @xmath51 , @xmath52 and their first order derivatives .",
    "following @xcite , we will group the corrections according to the total number of involved derivatives of the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "the most general first - order term in the lagrangian which is compatible with the symmetries ( [ symmetry1])-([symmetry3 ] ) has the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is an arbitrary function .",
    "it is worth noting that this term is linear in the second derivatives of fields @xmath2 .",
    "since the equation ( [ current_div ] ) is an identity , the theory is free of first - order corrections @xcite .",
    "indeed , in view of the equations ( [ current ] ) and ( [ current_div ] ) , the term ( [ f - o ] ) can be reduced to a total derivative .",
    "the general form of second - order correction is a linear combination of six scalars @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 are arbitrary scalar functions , and @xmath57 is the alternating unit tensor .",
    "fluid lagrangians involving the term @xmath58 with constant @xmath59 have been examined recently @xcite in the context of mimetic gravity @xcite .",
    "the more general models , in which @xmath59 is a function of the mimetic field , are also investigated in @xcite .",
    "the case of second - order correction @xmath60 appears to be the simplest to general study .",
    "a sample of such term with @xmath61 has been considered in @xcite . moreover",
    ", the term ( [ hd ] ) plays a crucial role in the analysis of dark matter perturbations in the framework of the effective field theory for hydrodynamics ( we will discuss this issue at the beginning of section [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "the second - order term ( [ hd ] ) in the lagrangian gives the following contribution to the energy - momentum tensor @xmath62 the variation of the total action with respect to scalar fields @xmath2 yields the equations of motion of the fluid @xmath63_{,\\nu } = 0.\\ ] ]      in the following , we will study the case of the power - law dependence of @xmath54 .",
    "the corresponding term in the lagrangian takes the form @xmath64 this choice of second - order corrections looks natural since the description of any perfect fluid with constant equation of state also uses the power - law dependence of the function @xmath38 .    to completely specify a model , one need to choose the lowest order lagrangian . in this paper",
    ", we consider a model of cold dark matter with higher derivative corrections performing a more general analysis where it is convenient or necessary .",
    "the cold dark matter action with considered higher derivative corrections has the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are some constants . instead the coupling constant @xmath68",
    ", one can use the dimensionless parameter @xmath69 .",
    "in this section we consider a homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat universe .",
    "the line element has the form @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the scale factor and @xmath72 is conformal time .",
    "since the fields @xmath2 can be regarded as comoving coordinates of the fluid , one can write @xmath73 here , the bar indicates that the expression is evaluated for the background line element ( [ spf ] ) .    substituting the background fields @xmath74 into the equation ( [ matrix ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xcite @xmath75 a direct check shows that the background fields @xmath74 are the solutions of the field equations ( [ fluid_base ] ) .    to study the background evolution of the fluid with higher derivative corrections , we use a slightly different approach than that was implemented in @xcite .",

    "it occurs when the scale factor takes the critical value @xmath91 , which is the solution of the equation @xmath92 the critical value @xmath91 is determined by the coupling constant @xmath66 and the power - law index @xmath93 . at @xmath94 and sufficiently small @xmath95 , the singularity falls on the planck era near which our effective field theory is not applicable .",
    "this singularity also can be avoided in more complex models that involve a generating process of the dark matter fluid . at @xmath96 ,",

    "however , the near - standard evolution of the scale factor @xmath99 during the radiation dominated and matter dominated stages can be obtained only when the influence of higher derivative terms on the background solution is weak or veiled .",
