    "the opera experiment @xcite recently reported an advance arrival time of muon neutrinos in traversing a distance @xmath1730 km between cern and the detector at lngs .",
    "the opera collaboration reports a discovery with 6 @xmath2 significance of an excess velocity of @xmath3 relative to the velocity of light .",
    "some support for this result comes from a similar outcome of the minos experiment @xcite over essentially the same baseline distance and operating at similar energies .",
    "if true , these results should be considered in contrast to a null - result for the @xmath4 mev neutrino detections from sn1987a @xcite .",
    "minos @xcite performed an early attempt with relatively few neutrinos to measure the true neutrino time - of - flight ( tof ) by measuring arrival times at the locations of two neutrino detectors .",
    "this method is insensitive to the nature of neutrino creation .",
    "opera , instead , measures a tof indirectly on the basis of a template , defined by the proton pdf .",
    "the arrival time of the neutrino bursts at lngs is defined by a one - parameter best - fit between the template and the neutrino light curve by application of matched filtering .    extracting the true tof to evaluate the possibility of signals traveling faster than the velocity of light requires taking into account causality , here the time of arrival of the front leading the neutrino burst of 10.5 @xmath5s .",
    "the opera defines the time of arrival of the neutrino burst by a best - fit position of the proton pdf to the neutrino light curve on the basis of time shifts . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_0 ] , this procedure is sensitive to the width of the neutrino burst relative to the width of the proton pdf , that may be different due to uncertainties in the process of neutrino creation .",
    "in particular , a neutrino light curve that is narrower by 1.2% relative to the proton pdf produces an apparent 60 ns advance arrival time , as inferred from an inadvertently advanced position by 0.6% of the front of the proton pdf produced in the opera best - fit analysis relative to the front of the neutrino light curve .    here , we present a refined analysis of the opera data - analysis by a two - parameter matched filtering procedure , that identifies and corrects for discrepant widths of the neutrino light curve and to the proton pdf .",
    "we apply matched filtering comprising both time shifts and stretching , developed in the analysis of light curves of long duration gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "the opera experiment measurement of the light curve in neutrinos at lngs in relation to a proton pdf of about 10.5 @xmath5s duration in their creation at cern represents the accumulation of 16111 events gathered in 2009 - 2011 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] following @xcite .    to determine the width of the neutrino light curve relative to proton pdf , we first normalize the data in durations and count rates and consider the normalized proton pdf as the template in a matched filtering procedure .",
    "we search for an optimal fit to the neutrino light curve , by transforming the template by shifts @xmath6 in time and scaling by @xmath7 of the time axis , and search for the optimal match of the transformed template to the normalized neutrino light curve data .",
    "the results are obtained following three iterations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] .",
    "the opera experiment considers first and second extractions , defined by two successive neutrino bursts separated by 50 ms .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] shows that the width of the normalized neutrino light curve relative to the normalized proton pdf is 0.4% and 0.5% in the first and second extractions .",
    "the average of 0.45% introduces a fractional correction of @xmath8 to the opera significance of 6 @xmath2 , reducing it to 3.75 @xmath2 .",
    "the above shows that the opera experiment , in contradistinction to the minos experiment , is sensitive to the nature of creation of the neutrinos that may , for as yet undetermined reasons , produce a neutrino light curve that is narrower than the proton pdf .",
    "a two - parameter matched filtering analysis of the first and second extractions shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "it introduces a correction to the one - parameter opera data - analysis , reducing the overall significance to less than 4@xmath0    our results indicate the need for enhanced data - sets by continuation of minos and opera experiments and analysis by two or more parameter matched filtering methods . conceivably , future results point to novel physics in neutrino creation and propagation .",
