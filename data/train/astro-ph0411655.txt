    "in the past decade , @xmath6  130 extrasolar planets have been discovered as companions to late - type dwarfs mostly from precise radial velocities ( prv ; e.g.  walker et al .",
    "1995 ) from which the keplerian orbital parameters and minimum planetary masses can be derived . from transiting planets ,",
    "of which five are known , true planetary masses , radii , densities and albedo - dependent estimates of surface temperature are available . to date , a handful of experiments have lead to further information about these planets , including lyman  @xmath7 ( vidal - madjar et al .  2003 ) and sodium detections ( charbonneau et al .",
    "2002 ) in the atmosphere of the transiting planet around hd  209458 .",
    "a current review of follow - up techniques to probe planetary characteristics has been presented by charbonneau ( 2003 ) .",
    "the presence of a giant planet likely influences its parent star beyond the dynamical perturbations measured by the prv method .",
    "robinson & bopp ( 1987 ) caught the signatures of  superflares \" with energies of @xmath8  10@xmath9 ergs ( schaefer et al .",
    "2000 ) on nine solar analogs which have no otherwise unusual properties such as very rapid rotation or very high chromospheric activity .",
    "rubenstein & schaefer ( 2000 ) suggested that these anomalous superflares were stimulated by an unseen close - in extrasolar giant planet ( cegp , also known as a ` hot jupiter ' ) .",
    "they explored the possibility of magnetic reconnection events occurring between both the star s and the planet s entangled magnetic fields .",
    "cuntz et al .",
    "( 2000 ) suggested a more consistent observable interaction between a parent star and its hot jupiter in the form of enhanced stellar activity of the star s outer atmosphere .",
    "this interaction can take the form of tidal and/or magnetic heating of the plasma .",
    "both the star and its planet experience strong tidal forces as well as repeated magnetic reconnection with a large planetary magnetosphere . if such planet - induced heating of the star is confined to a narrow range in stellar longitude , the heated regions likely track the planet as it orbits .",
    "this implies that the period of any observed activity would be correlated with the planet s orbital period @xmath10 such that tidally induced activity has a period of @xmath11 and magnetic activity , a period of @xmath10 . in the simplest configuration of magnetic interaction ,",
    "the expected enhancement would occur near the sub - planetary point , which defines orbital phase @xmath12 at the time when the planet is in front of the star relative to the line - of - sight .",
    "a partial analogy can be made to the jupiter - io system ( zarka et al .",
    "2001 ) where the volcanically active moon of jupiter , orbiting at a distance of 5.9 @xmath13 , constantly couples with jupiter s magnetosphere , leaving two footprints at high positive and negative latitudes on the planet s surface .",
    "plasma flows along the magnetic field lines , making up the io flux tube , as these footprints follow io in its orbit .",
    "even though the analogy is limited , a similar phenomenon may occur between cegps and their stars such that coupling between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star may cause footprints or  hotspots \" on the star s surface which follow the planet and have a period close to the planet s orbital period similarly , auroral emission may be stimulated on the planet s atmosphere ( zarka et al .",
    "2001 ) but no searches for planetary radio emissions have yet been successful ( e.g. bastian et al .  2000 , farrell et al .",
    "2003 , ryabov et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "more recently , santos et al .  ( 2003 ) observed cyclic photometric variations with a period very similar to that of the radial velocity ( rv ) curve for the k dwarf hd  192263 . the stability of the 24.4-day periodic radial velocity through almost 4 years of data ( santos et al .",
    "2000 , henry et al .",
    "2002 ) rules out the interpretation that stellar activity alone is the cause of the rv curve and supports the existence of a planetary - sized companion around the star . however , they question what might cause a quasi - stable photometric period that coincides with the planetary orbit .",
    "they offered planet - induced magnetic activity off - set by 90@xmath14 from the sub - planetary point as an explanation .",
    "even though the interpretations of rubenstein & schaefer ( 2000 ) and santos et al .",
    "( 2003 ) are uncertain , there exists ample observational evidence of such tidal and magnetic interactions in the exaggerated case of the rs canum venaticorum ( rs cvn ) stars , which are tightly - orbiting binary systems consisting of two chromospherically active late - type stars .",
    "for example , catalano et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found as many starspots and plages within 45@xmath14 of the sub - binary point as on the rest of the stellar surface for several rs cvn systems .",
    "@xmath15  and , a relatively long - period system ( @xmath10 = 20.1 d ; walker 1944 ) , shows modulation of the mg  ii uv chromospheric emission lines with a period of 10 days , half the orbital period .",
    "glebocki et al .",
    "( 1986 ) interpreted this as a tidal heating of the primary by its companion , possibly a brown dwarf ( donati et al .",
    "1995 ) . and ,",
    "in our own ca ii h & k observations of er  vul , an rs cvn system with two g  v dwarfs and @xmath10 = 0.69 d , we see clear enhancements near the sub - binary longitudes ( shkolnik et al .  2004 ) .    with these scenarios in mind , we searched for periodic chromospheric heating by monitoring the ca  ii h & k emission in stars with giant planets within a few stellar radii .",
    "we chose to study the tightest observable systems since the tidal and magnetic interactions depend on the distance from the planet to the star as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "of the known extrasolar planets , about 20% have semi - major axes of less than 0.1 au and masses comparable to jupiter s ( schneider 2004 ) .",
    "it is expected that these planets have magnetic fields also similar to jupiter s ( 4.3 g ) .",
    "it is also reasonable to assume that any magnetic interaction would be greatest in the outermost layers of the star , namely the chromosphere , transition region and the corona due to their proximity to the planet , low density , and nonradiative heat sources .",
    "the broad , deep photospheric absorption of the ca  ii h & k lines allows the chromospheric emission to be seen at higher contrast . because of this and the accessibility from the ground , the h & k reversals are an optimal choice with which to monitor chromospheric heating of these sun - like stars .",
    "our program stars have orbital periods between 2.5 and 4.6 days , eccentricities @xmath6  0 and semi - major axes @xmath18 au .",
    "these systems offer the best chance of observing upper atmospheric heating .",
    "the first five systems we observed were @xmath5  boo , hd  179949 , hd  209458 , 51  peg and @xmath1  and from the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) .",
    "the first results from 2001 and 2002 observations , including the first evidence of planet - induced magnetic heating of hd  179949 , were published in shkolnik et al .",
    "we later extended the experiment at the very large telescope ( vlt ) to include five southern targets , hd  46357 , hd  73256 , hd  75289 , hd  76700 , and hd  83443 .",
    "the system parameters for the program stars are listed in table 1 along with our two standards , @xmath5  ceti and the sun .    in this paper , we compile our 2003 cfht data with those of previous years and include the recent vlt observations . a broader understanding of stellar activity , its cycles , and planet - induced chromospheric heating emerges .",
    "we also observed @xmath0  ceti , a young ( 650 @xmath19 750 myr old ) , chromospherically active , solar analog .",
    "it was one of the nine stars reported to have anomalous superflare activity by robinson & bopp ( 1987 ) possibly caused by magnetic interactions with a close - in giant planet ( rubenstein & schaefer 2000 ) .",
    "of their sample , only @xmath0  ceti has been looked at by the prv planet searches of walker et al .",

    "( 1999 ) and halbwachs et al .",

    "interestingly though , walker et al .",
    "( 1995 ) observed a rapid rv change of 80 m  s@xmath20 in 1988 which could have been caused by a planet in highly elliptical orbit .",
    "however , it coincided with an equally sharp increase in the ca ii chromospheric activity indicator at 8662  implying the rv jump was likely due to changes intrinsic to the star .",

    "the location of the hot jupiter relative to the alfvn radius ( the distance from the star at which the radial velocity of the wind @xmath68 equals the local alfvn velocity @xmath69 ) plays a significant role in transporting energy toward the star against the stellar winds . since the alfvn radius of the sun is about 10 to 20 r@xmath70 at solar minimum and 30 r@xmath70 at solar maximum ( e.g.  lotova et al .",
    "1985 ) , the small distance @xmath71 au of hot jupiters from their host stars suggests that unlike our jupiter , surrounded by a bow shock , some of these hot jupiters are located inside the alfvn radius depending on the magnetic strength of their host stars ( zarka et al .",
    "2001 , ip et al .",
    "therefore the direct magnetic interactions between a hot jupiter and its star without a bow shock might resemble the io - jupiter interactions ( zarka et al .",
    "2001 ) or the rs cvn binaries ( rubenstein & schaefer 2000 ) .",
    "most of the theoretical models applied to these two cases have focused on the geometry of intertwined magnetic fields as well as the the energy transport through alfvn waves and/or induced currents .",
    "alfvn waves can not propagate along the stellar field lines toward the star in the region outside the alfvn radius where the group velocity of alfvn waves is always in the positive radial direction ( e.g. weber & davis 1967 ) .",
    "other means of inward energy transport require their energy flux to be at least larger than the energy flux carried by the stellar winds .",
    "ip et al .  ( 2004 ) estimate the input magnetic power due to the relative motion between the synchronized hot jupiter and the stellar magnetosphere to be @xmath72 ergs  s@xmath20 , the same order of magnitude of a typical solar flare . a similar amount of power might be obtained based on the induced current model ( zarka et al .",
    "2001 ) if the radius of the ionosphere of an unmagnetized hot jupiter in the induced current model can be approximated by the radius of the magnetopause of a magnetized hot jupiter .",
    "the observed excess energy flux from an unresolved disk of the star is equal to this input magnetic power averaged over the disk of the star .",

    "we have assumed that the stellar magnetic field decays as @xmath82 , the planetary field decays as @xmath83 , @xmath74 was determined by equating the stellar and planetary fields at the magnetopause ( i.e. @xmath84 ) , and the stellar magnetosphere inside the alfvn radius is nearly co - rotating with the stellar rotation ( i.e. @xmath85 ) .",
    "the radial component of the stellar wind @xmath68 is left out from the above estimate as long as the condition @xmath86 is valid . the energy flux in eq([eq : energyflux ] )",
    "should be regarded as the maximal input energy from the planet s orbital energy because only some fraction of this amount of energy is transferred to the ca ii emissions . for @xmath87 ( vrsnak et al .",
    "2002 for the case of our sun , and weber & davis 1967 for the case of open fields ) , @xmath88 , @xmath67 = 0.045  au , @xmath89  r@xmath70 , @xmath90  r@xmath66 , @xmath91 d , @xmath92 = 200  g , and @xmath93 = 10  g , the energy flux given by eq([eq : energyflux ] ) is roughly equal to 10@xmath48 erg  @xmath49  s@xmath20 , a value comparable to the differential intensity from our data of ca ii k emission from hd 179949 .",
    "the same amount of energy flux can be also achieved for the case of a dipole field for the hot jupiter ( @xmath87 , @xmath94 ) where @xmath95  au , @xmath92 = 250  g , and @xmath81 = 10  g. if both the star and the planet have dipole fields ( @xmath96 ) , very strong fields @xmath97 g and @xmath98 g are required to generate the same energy flux .",
    "therefore the tight energy budget constrained by the synchronous ca ii emission from hd 179949 strongly suggests that the mean global fields of this f - type star are not likely in a dipole field configuration at the location of the planet but have the radial , open structure ( i.e. @xmath87 ) just like the solar fields have as a result of the outflowing winds .    the argument that hot jupiters might have weaker fields than our jupiter due to slower spin rates and weaker convection ( snchez - lavega 2004 )",
    "should be treated with caution since in addition to the uncertainty in the interior structure of the metallic hydrogen region of a hot jupiter , the response of slow convection to various rotation rates in the dynamo process is not well understood .",
    "if @xmath87 , and @xmath99 1  g",
    "( snchez - lavega 2004 ) for hd 179949 b , then eq([eq : energyflux ] ) indicates that @xmath92 = 300  g is required to generate the energy flux 10@xmath48 erg  @xmath49  s@xmath20 and in this case the stellar field dominates over the planetary field even on the surface of the hot jupiter ( i.e. @xmath100 in eq([eq : energyflux ] ) ) .",
    "the observational constraints on the strength of the stellar magnetic fields such as the field versus ca  ii relation ( schrijver et al .",
    "1989 , 1992 ) along with the radio cyclotron emissions from the hot jupiter s magnetosphere , where @xmath101 is the speed of light , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are the electron charge and mass respectively .",
    "the radiation can reach @xmath104 mhz if @xmath105 g. ] should help to narrow down the field strength of hot jupiters in the magnetic interaction scenario , therefore improving our knowledge of the interior structure and the dynamo processes of gaseous planets .",
    "now we turn our attention to the variation of ca ii level , the phase coverage of additional emission , and the phase lead at the different epochs of our observations .",
    "the data for hd  179949 seem to suggest that the additional ca  ii emission is smaller and the range of phase spanned by the emission is larger when the average ( or minimal ) k emission is larger .",
    "presumably this has something to do with the intrinsic stellar activity and therefore the stellar field geometry .",
    "the observed phase lead may be caused by spiral stellar fields loaded with stellar winds .",
    "when a star is in its quiet phase and therefore the average ca  ii emission is very low , no enhancement happens probably because @xmath106 for a hot jupiter located far out from its parent star and therefore being outside the alfvn radius , as may be the case for the 2001 august observations of @xmath1 and .",
    "as the star shifts to its more active phase , the average ca  ii emission is at the moderate level and @xmath107 is not far smaller than @xmath108 at the hot jupiter . at this time , the configuration of the field lines on the surface of the star may be characterized by the open fields from the coronal holes covering a large area of the star , as well as the closed fields distributed only near the magnetic equator .",
    "consequently the foot - points of the open stellar field lines pointing to the planet are located at lower latitudes , as indicated by the 2001 and 2002 data for hd 179949 fitted by a truncated sine curve ( shkolnik et al .",
    "2003 ; also shown in figure  [ intk2 ] ) . while a great number of closed fields form at low magnetic latitudes during this time , the coronal holes shrink to the magnetic polar regions .",
    "the bright spot at a high latitude implied from the observation for hd 179949 in september 2003 might be caused by the scenario that the hot jupiter perturbs the open field lines emanating from the shrinking coronal holes near the polar regions , leading to a longer phase duration of the additional ca ii flux and perhaps reducing the additional emission due to the smaller projection along the line of sight at higher latitudes .",
    "note that at the time close to the stellar - maximum activity , the stellar field lines might be occasionally stretched out like solar streamers emanating from the low latitudes of the star where closed loops of stellar magnetic fields aggregate , possibly giving rise to the planet - induced heating at low latitudes of the stellar surface as well .",
    "the picture that we have sketched thus far assumes that most of energy flux released from the vicinity of the hot jupiter is transported along the field lines by alfvn waves and deposited at the foot - points of the magnetic lines .",
    "since the field lines inside the alfvn radius are dominated by the poloidal component , detailed calculations for stellar wind models are needed to study how the integration of small pitch angles of the field line can lead to the moderate to large phase angles , @xmath109 for hd  179949 and @xmath110 for @xmath1  and .",
    "the phase difference is also determined by the alfvn - speed travel time along the stellar field line . if @xmath111 , the alfvn disturbance roughly takes @xmath112 a few hours to propagate from the hot jupiter to the star with @xmath113 cm  s@xmath20 at 0.04 au .",
    "this means that the azimuthal angle that the planet has already traveled over the alfvn - speed travel time is not small . since the hot jupiter of @xmath1  and",
    "is located farther out ( @xmath114 au ) from its star than hd  179949 b ( @xmath95 au ) , the large phase angle of @xmath110 for @xmath1  and might actually represent a phase lag caused by the small inward group velocity of the alfvn waves @xmath115 that takes considerable amount of time to travel along the field lines right after the waves are generated from the planet .",
    "alternatively , a large phase difference between the location of the heating spot in the chromosphere and the position of the hot jupiter might be caused by the entangled or rotationally spiraled magnetic fields connecting directly between the hot jupiter and the star ( rubenstein & schaefer 2000 , saar et al .",
    "2004 , ip et al .",
    "2004 ) .    besides considering the energy transported along the field lines and field geometry , understanding how the energy is dissipated is important to construct a complete picture for the ca  ii emission in the planet - induced scenario . in our own solar system , a bow shock of the solar wind generally hinders this because alfvn waves can not propagate toward the star from the region outside the alfvn radius . the inward poynting energy of alfvn waves @xmath116 is roughly conserved if the wind velocity @xmath68 is much smaller than the alfvn speed @xmath69 . here",
    "@xmath117 is the distance away from the star , @xmath118 is the magnetic disturbance of the wave , and @xmath119 is the mass density of the stellar wind . at first glance , the transition region characterized by a steep decrease of the alfvn speed with depth seems to provide a possible radial stratification for the inward - propagating alfvn waves to pile up the magnetic energy density , leading to the nonlinear dissipation of the growing waves and therefore the heating on the top of the chromosphere .",
    "however , the extremely narrow transition region corresponding to sharp gradient in density and alfvn speed should act as a wave barrier to reflect the alfvn waves . in this case , the wavelength is comparable to the size of the magnetopause of the hot jupiter ( wright 1987 ) unless the high - frequency modes are largely excited at the reconnection site . the energy carried by the planet - induced alfvn waves along the open fields",
    "might be finally transmitted to coronal loops and therefore might be dissipated via resonance absorption , a damping mechanism however in contradiction to the observations of the solar corona and the coronae of cool stars ( schrijver & aschwanden 2002 ; demoulin et al .",
    "the heating due to accelerated particles by alfvn waves ( crary 1997 ) is not important either because unlike the interplanetary space , the dense corona eliminates the kinetic effect of plasmas inside 0.04 au . despite the difficulties , the energy deposit on the surface of the star from the planet - induced alfvn disturbances may be achieved by interacting non - linearly with stellar winds .",
    "the stellar wind consists of charges particles , stellar fields , and probably alfvn waves .",
    "non - linear interactions between planet - induced incoming and stellar intrinsic outgoing waves is one route of heating the surface of the star .",
    "the scenario of magnetic interaction implies the orbital decay of hot jupiters since the ultimate source of energy comes from the orbital energy .",
    "theoretically the orbital decay of hot jupiters on the timescale of a few billion years can result from the tidal dissipation in the host star driven by the hot jupiter so long as the tidal dissipation in the solar - type stars is efficient ( rasio et al .",
    "1996 , witte & savonije 2002 , ptzold & rauer 2002 , jiang et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the magnetic interaction scenario for ca ii emission ,",
    "the time scale of orbital decay is roughly equal to the ratio of the orbital energy of the hot jupiter ( @xmath810@xmath120 ergs ) to @xmath121 erg / s .",

    ", one can estimate that the input energy to @xmath5 boo is less than that to hd 179949 roughly by a factor of 0.15 .",
    "if the corresponding ca  ii emissions are dimmed by this same factor , this effect should have been detected .",
    "however unlike the other two f - type stars hd 179949 and @xmath1  and , the variability of ca",
    "ii emissions from @xmath5 boo did not show any consistent phase relation with the planet s orbit .",
    "note that the radial movement of spiral stellar fields with the stellar winds might be important in providing energy in this case because @xmath125 at 0.04 au in the solar system .",
    "however in the case of small pitch angles of the field lines inside the alfvn radius , the alfvn modes driven solely by the radial impact of the stellar winds might not be as efficient as the stellar fields sweeps across the hot jupiter due to the slow relative azimuthal motion .",
    "the transiting system hd 209458 did not show synchronized ca ii enhancement , perhaps because g stars have @xmath126 at the distance of the hot jupiter due to weaker stellar fields .",
    "the non - synchronized ca ii enhancement of @xmath5 boo and hd  209458 ( as well as the flaring on hd 73256 and @xmath0  ceti , discussed in section  [ modbyrot ] ) might still be attributed to direct interactions with their planets but through more chaotic means due to the variability of the stellar winds at the locations of these hot jupiters relative to the nearby alfvn radius .",
    "monitoring these stars continuously through several orbital and rotational periods should pin down the cause @xmath19 intrinsic due to fast rotation or induced by a hot jupiter @xmath19 of the strong night - to - night variabilities detected in these systems .",
    "of the sample of stars observed from the cfht , those with planets ( with the exception of 51  peg ) show significant night - to - night variations in their ca  ii h and k reversals .",
    "@xmath5  ceti and the sun , which have no close planets , remained very steady throughout each of the four observing runs .",
    "hd  179949 and @xmath1  and exhibited repeated orbital phase - dependent activity with enhanced emission leading the sub - planetary point by 0.17 and 0.47 in orbital phase , respectively .",
    "both systems are consistent with a magnetic heating scenario and may be the first glimpse at the magnetospheres of extrasolar planets . the phase - lead or lag of the peak emission relative to the sub - planetary longitude can provide information on the field geometries and the nature of the effect such as tidal friction , magnetic drag or reconnection with off - center magnetic fields , including a parker - spiral type scenario .    @xmath5 boo and hd 209458 also exhibited night - to - night variations that could not exclusively be due to stellar rotation .",
    "if @xmath5 boo is indeed tidally locked by its hot jupiter , there is no orbital energy available to generate the alfvn modes efficiently as the stellar fields sweep across the planet due to the slow relative azimuthal motion .",
    "we measured the excess absolute flux released in the enhanced chromospheric emission of hd  179949 to be the same order of magnitude as a typical solar flare , @xmath8  10@xmath47 erg  s@xmath20 or 1.5@xmath2610@xmath48 ergs  s@xmath20  @xmath49 .",
    "this implies that flare - like activity triggered by the interaction of a star with its hot jupiter may be an important energy source in the stellar outer atmosphere .",
    "this offers a mechanism for short - term chromospheric activity .",
    "the h & k emission of @xmath0  ceti , an active star with no confirmed planet , was clearly modulated by the star s 9.3-d rotation .",
    "similarly , hd 73256 displayed rotational modulation with its 14-d period .",
    "in these two cases , the chromospheric emission increases by @xmath6  6% ( relative to the normalization level at 1/3 of the continuum ) .",
    "any planet - induced heating at the level of 1 @xmath19 2% could have been diluted by the dominating hotspot on the stellar surface .",
    "neither the @xmath27rvs nor the ca ii periodicity exclude the possibility of a sub - stellar companion in a tight orbit around @xmath0  ceti .",
    "apart from the cyclical component for four of the stars , short - term chromospheric activity appears weakly dependent on the mean k - line reversal intensities for the sample of 13 stars .",
    "also , a suggestive correlation exists with @xmath2sin@xmath3 and thus with the hot jupiter s magnetic field strength .",
    "because of their small separation ( @xmath4 0.1 au ) , many of the hot jupiters lie within the alfvn radius of their host stars which allows a direct magnetic interaction with the stellar surface .",
    "additional ca ii observations are crucial to confirm the stability of the magnetic interaction as well as to establish better phase coverage .",
    "observations on timescales of a few years will begin to characterize the long - term activity of our program stars and allow us to see correlations between intrinsic ca ii emission and night - to - night activity more clearly .",
    "this work opens up the possibility of characterizing planet - star interactions with implications for extrasolar planet magnetic fields and the energy contribution to stellar atmospheres .",
    "a next step in understanding planet - star interactions is to map the activity as a function of stellar atmospheric height . above the chromosphere",
    "lies the thin transition region ( tr ) , where the temperature increases steeply as density and pressure drop , and the corona , which can extend out to several stellar radii . and since the magnetic field drops off as @xmath82 ( where @xmath127 ) , these layers facilitate a stronger interaction with the planet",
    ". their fuv and x - ray emissions will be extremely important diagnostics .",
    "one indication that the heating is from the outside in is if the increase in emission occurs slightly earlier in phase than in ca ii .",
    "moreover , the relative strengths of the different emission lines will tell us where most of the energy is dissipated . the energy sum will point out if there are any discrepancies with the theorized energy budget .",
    "orbital phase - dependent variability at these heights will constrain further the nature , form and strength of the interaction as well as specify non - thermal radiative processes in these hot layers of gas .",
