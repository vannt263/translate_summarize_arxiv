    "entanglement is a quantum physical property that describes a correlation between quantum systems that has no classical analogy . when a quantum system is entangled , the best possible knowledge of the whole does not include the best possible knowledge of its parts .",
    "in particular , a quantum system possesses additional correlations that do not have a classical counterpart .",
    "the study of the nature of these quantum correlations has attracted a lot of interest in the last decade .    at zero temperature , quantum fluctuations",
    "play the dominant role and with the ground state properties the physics of a system determined .",
    "the quantum fluctuations cause a fundamental change in the state of a system which is known as the quantum phase transition .",
    "entanglement is expected to play an essential role in quantum phase transitions , where quantum fluctuations manifest themselves at all length scales .",
    "it is believed that the entanglement estimators give important insight into the physics of the quantum phase transitions .",
    "low - dimensional quantum spin systems exhibit quantum phase transitions for different driving parameters , like a magnetic field .",
    "in particular , we address this problem by selecting a system of spins which are arranged on a two - leg ladder lattice with antiferromagnetic isotropic couplings along the legs and rungs .",
    "the @xmath0 isotropic antiferromagnetic two - leg ladders , have attracted much interest for a number of reasons . on the one hand",
    ", there has been remarkable progress in recent years in the fabrication of such ladder compounds@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "spin - ladder systems pose interesting theoretical problems , since they have a gap in their excitation spectrum . in the presence of a magnetic field",
    ", they reveal an extremely rich behaviour , dominated by quantum effects .",
    "these quantum phase transitions have been investigated intensively both theoretically@xcite and experimentally@xcite .    in a recent paper ,",
    "the ground state phase diagram of a different kind of two - leg ladder with spatially - modulated spin - exchange coupling constants has been studied@xcite in the limit of strong rung exchange and magnetic field .",

    "the interleg coupling is antiferromagnetic , @xmath6 .",
    "the non - modulated case@xcite , @xmath7 , undergos two quantum phase transitions at critical fields , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the first corresponds to the transition from the gapped rung - singlet phase to the gapless ll phase .",
    "the second represents the transition from the ll phase into the fully polarised ferromagnetic phase .",
    "recently , the bipartite entanglement measures close to the quantum critical points@xcite have been investigated .",
    "it was found that the derivatives of the entanglement measures diverge as @xmath10 but remain finite as @xmath11 .",
    "the entanglement entropy was also studied for two - leg ladders within spin wave theory and the dmrg method @xcite .    for the modulated case , @xmath12",
    ", the continuum - limit bosonizatin analysis@xcite shows two additional quantum phase transitions between a middle gapped phase and two gapless ll phases .",
    "these transitions manifest themselves most clearly in the presence of a new magnetisation plateau at magnetisation equal to one half of its saturation value . using the numerical lanczos method , the existence of four critical fields , the magnetisation plateau at half of the saturation value and two gapless ll phases are confirmed@xcite .",
    "in this paper we continue the study of this model .",
    "first , using perturbation theory , we find four critical fields in good agreement with the previous results .",
    "then , using the numerical lanczos method , the concurrence and entanglement entropy will be calculated and used to show that the ll phases are fundamentally different .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the forthcoming section we present the perturbation results . in section",
    "iii we present the results of an accurate numerical experiment on the entanglement between spins at zero temperature .",
    "finally , we discuss and summarise our results in section iv .",
    "we are interested in the behaviour of the model eq.([hamiltonian ] ) in the limit of strong rung exchange , @xmath13 . for this aim",
    ", it is convenient to rewrite the hamiltonian given in eq.([hamiltonian ] ) in the form    @xmath14 { { \\bf s}}_{n,1 } \\cdot { { \\bf s}}_{n,2}\\nonumber \\\\ & - & h \\sum_{n,\\alpha } s^{z}_{n,\\alpha},\\nonumber \\\\ \\nonumber \\\\ { \\cal v}&=&j_{\\parallel } \\sum_{n,\\alpha } { { \\bf s}}_{n,\\alpha } \\cdot { { \\bf s}}_{n+1,\\alpha}.   \\label{per - hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the unperturbed part , @xmath15 , is the hamiltonian of a non - interacting @xmath16 pair of spins .",
    "the eigenstate of the unperturbed hamiltonian is written as a product of pair states . by solving the eigenvalue equation of an individual pair",
    ", one can easily find the eigenstates as @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "their eigenvalues are , respectively , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "when the magnetic field is zero , the ground state of a pair of spins is singlet . by increasing the magnetic field",
    ", the energy of @xmath25 becomes closer to @xmath26 and an abrupt quantum phase transition@xcite occurs at @xmath27 . by further increasing the field , @xmath25 will become the ground state of a distinct pair .",
    "thus , for a strong enough magnetic field , we have a situation in which the behaviour of the system is determined by the singlet @xmath28 and triplet @xmath29 states .",
    "let us start with the case of @xmath7 .",
    "since the ground state energy of a distinct pair is twofold degenerate at @xmath30 , the ground state energy of the unperturbed hamiltonian , @xmath31 , is @xmath32 times degenerate @xcite .",
    "the perturbation @xmath33 splits this degeneracy . by applying first order perturbation theory for finite ladders ( @xmath34 ) with periodic boundary conditions and generalising the results to the thermodynamic limit",
    "we have found the critical fields to be    @xmath35    which are in good agreement with the results obtained using analytical field theory@xcite .",
    "it was shown that the first critical field , @xmath8 , corresponds to the transition from the gapped rung singlet phase to the ll phase .",
    "the second one , @xmath9 , represents the transition from the ll phase to the fully polarised ferromagnetic phase@xcite .    in the case of dimerised ladders@xcite , @xmath36",
    ", there are two kind of rungs : strong and weak . in this case , by increasing the magnetic field , first weak rungs start to melt and undergo into the triplet state with respect to the strong rungs . therefore , it is natural to find two additional critical fields in compare the non - dimerised case ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , we found that second order perturbation theory should be used for solving the eigenvalue equation .",
    "the obtained critical fields are    @xmath37    we emphasise that the above perturbation results are in good agreement with estimations made within the continuum - limit approach@xcite and numerical lanczos method@xcite .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the ground state phase diagram consists of five phases : ( i. ) the rung - singlet phase in the region @xmath38 , ( ii . ) the first ll phase in the region @xmath39 , ( iii . ) the gapped mid - plateau state in the region @xmath40 , ( iv . ) the second ll phase in the region @xmath41 and ( v. ) the saturated ferromagnetic phase in the region @xmath42 .",
    "on the other hand , we also calculated the ground state of the system in different sectors of the ground state phase diagram , which allows us to follow the melting process on the entanglement function@xcite .",
    "the entanglement of formation is defined as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the concurrence which is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 @xmath48 denotes the correlation function between spins on sites @xmath49 and @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the notation @xmath52 represents the ground state expectation value . because @xmath53 , the entanglement of formation between spins on a rung is an important quantity . in the region of the magnetic",
    "filed , @xmath38 , the ground state is written as a product of singlet rung states . in this region",
    "the concurrence between spins on a rung attains its maximum value , one . for very large values of the field ,",
    "@xmath42 , the system is in the saturated ferromagnetic phase and the ground state is a product of triplet ( @xmath25 ) rung states . in the saturated phase the concurrence takes zero value",
    "therefore , during the melting process , the concurrence between spins on rungs changes from the completely entangled state into the non - entangled state .",
    "in addition , using the perturbation results on finite ladders , we found a relation for the concurrence between spins on a rung in different subspaces versus the number of rungs as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the number of triplet rungs in a subspace . in the rung singlet phase",
    ", the number of triplet rungs is zero and the concurrence is maximum . on the other hand , in the saturated ferromagnetic phase",
    "all rungs are triplet , @xmath56 , and particles are not entangled ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "by performing an experiment , one can obtain a clear picture of the entanglement phenomena in the ground state magnetic phases of the model . since a real experiment can not be done at zero temperature ,",
    "the best way is to undertake a virtual numerical experiment .",
    "a very famous and accurate method in field of numerical experiments is known as the lanczos method@xcite . in this section , to explore the nature of the spectrum and the quantum phase transition , we used the lanczos method to numerically diagonalise ladders with lengths up to @xmath58 and different values of the exchanges@xcite .",
    "the energies of the lowest - energy eigenstates were obtained for ladders with periodic boundary conditions .      since in a critical field",
    "the energy gap should be closed , the best way to find the critical fields is to investigate the energy gap , which is recognised as the difference between the energies of the first exited state and the ground state in finite two - leg ladders . as previous section",
    ", we start our consideration with the case of isotropic and uniform rung exchange ladders ( @xmath7 ) . we have calculated the energy gap for ladders with exchanges @xmath59 , @xmath60 and lengths @xmath61 . by means of the phenomenological renormalisation group technique@xcite",

    "we focus on the entanglement of formation as a measure of the entanglement .",
    "we compute the entanglement between two spins , which is known as the concurrence ( eq.([concurrence ] ) ) . in the region @xmath38 , where the system is in the non - magnetic rung - singlet phase , the correlations @xmath67 , @xmath68",
    ", @xmath69 should be the same and take the value @xmath70 , and therefore the concurrence must take the maximum value @xmath71 .",
    "on the other hand , for very large values of the magnetic field , @xmath42 , the ground state of the system is written as @xmath72 in this saturated ferromagnetic phase , the correlations are @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , the concurrence takes the minimum value @xmath57 .",
    "the numerical lanczos results describing the concurrence for a two - leg ladder with antiferromagnetic legs and the same rungs ( @xmath7 ) are shown in fig .",

    "it can be seen that the numerical results are in reasonable agreement with what is expected .",
    "essentially our numerical experiment shows that in the absence of a magnetic field , spins on a rung are maximally entangled . by applying a magnetic filed up to the first critical field @xmath8",
    ", the concurrence remains constant .",
    "this behaviour is in agreement with expectations , based on the general statement that in the gapped rung - singlet phase , the change in any physical function appears only at a finite critical value of the magnetic field equal to the spin gap .",
    "the concurrence starts to decrease as soon as the field passes beyond the first critical field @xmath8 .",
    "indeed the quantum correlations of the two spins on rungs decrease with increasing magnetic field . in the intermediate region",
    "the decreasing behaviour of the concurrence continues up to the second critical field @xmath9 , where it takes the zero value .",
    "as expected in the region of the saturated ferromagnetic phase , @xmath42 , the concurrence remains zero .",
    "the oscillations of the concurrence at finite @xmath77 in the region @xmath78 , are the result of level crossings between the ground state and excited states of the model .",

    "finally , in the full - saturated ferromagnetic state , all of concurrences disappear and the entanglement of the state is exactly zero .    apart from the concurrence between spins on rungs , it is completely natural to ask about the concurrence between spins on legs . to find a clear answer ,",
