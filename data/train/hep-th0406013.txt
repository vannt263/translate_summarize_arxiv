    "motivated by string theory and quantum gravity , many studies have been performed exploring the non - commutative effects that are expected to appear at the planck scale . associated to this",
    "is also the role played by a fundamental length ( or fundamental time ) as a new constant of nature .",
    "however , in my opinion , the most satisfactory and model - independent way to approach this problem is through deformation theory and considerations of structural stability of the physical theories .    indeed , the transition from non - relativistic to relativistic and from classical to quantum mechanics ,",
    "may be interpreted as the replacement of two unstable theories by two stable ones .",
    "that is , by theories that do not change in a qualitative manner under a small change of parameters .",
    "the deformation parameters are @xmath0 ( the inverse of the speed of light ) and @xmath1 ( the planck constant ) .",
    "stability arises from the fact that the algebraic structures are all equivalent for non - zero values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the zero value is an isolated point corresponding to the deformation - unstable classical theories .",
    "a similar stability analysis of relativistic quantum mechanics @xcite @xcite leads to a non - commutative space - time algebra @xmath2 ( on the tangent space ) @xmath3 & = & i(m_{\\mu \\sigma } \\eta _ { \\nu \\rho } + m_{\\nu \\rho } \\eta _ { \\mu \\sigma } -m_{\\nu \\sigma } \\eta _ { \\mu \\rho } -m_{\\mu \\rho } \\eta _ { \\nu \\sigma } ) \\\\   \\lbrack m_{\\mu \\nu } , p_{\\lambda } ] & = & i(p_{\\mu } \\eta _ { \\nu \\lambda } -p_{\\nu } \\eta _ { \\mu \\lambda } ) \\\\",

    "the non - commutative space - time geometry arising from this algebra has been studied @xcite , as well as the modification of the uncertainty relations @xcite .    here",
    "i will concentrate in some consequences of this non - commutative structure which might lead to simpler experimental tests .",
    "in particular phase - space suppression or enhancing effects will be discussed and their relevance to the calculation of the gzk sphere as well as the corrections to the spectrum of the coulomb problem .",
    "notice that the modifications introduced on the calculation of the gzk sphere do not arise from violation of lorentz invariance , which is well preserved , but from a change on the cross sections due to a phase - space volume suppression at high energies .",
    "the phase - space suppression only occurs if @xmath11 . if @xmath12 there would be a phase - space enhancing .",
    "the @xmath12 and @xmath11 cases are also quite different as far as the spectrum of the space - time coordinates is concerned . in the first case it is a space coordinate that has discrete spectrum , whereas the time spectrum is continuous . in the second , it is time that is discrete",
    ", space always having continuous spectrum .",
    "here we see that depending on the sign of @xmath6 , the available phase space volume at high momentum contracts or expands .",
    "first , this will be shown in the framework of a full representation of the algebra and then , to obtain a simple analytical estimate of the effect , a simpler representation of a subalgebra will be used .",
    "let @xmath13 be a representation of the @xmath14 algebra ( [ 1.1 ] ) by differential operators in a 5-dimensional commutative manifold @xmath15 with metric @xmath16    case @xmath12    changing to polar coordinates in the @xmath17 plane ( @xmath18 ) @xmath19    eigenstates of the @xmath20 coordinate , with eigenvalue @xmath21 , are @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 an arbitrary @xmath25function of @xmath26 .",
    "single - valuedness requires @xmath27 .",
    "that is , each space coordinate has a discrete spectrum .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath28 ( with eigenvalue @xmath29 ) are @xmath30 they have a wave function representation in the position basis @xmath31    to obtain the density of states one imposes periodic boundary conditions in a box of size @xmath32 , leading to @xmath33 for large @xmath29 , using the asymptotic expansion for bessel functions , eq.([2.6 ] ) leads to @xmath34 asymptotically , this is satisfied both for @xmath35 @xmath36 and odd or @xmath37 @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , for very large @xmath29 , no restrictions are put on the @xmath29 values .",
    "it means that the phase volume required for any new @xmath29 state shrinks as @xmath29 becomes large .",
    "the density of states diverges for large @xmath29",
    ".    case @xmath11    with hyperbolic coordinates @xmath39 in the @xmath17 plane , @xmath40    the eigenstates of the @xmath20 coordinate , with eigenvalue @xmath21 , are @xmath41 because @xmath42 , in this case the space coordinates have continuous spectrum .",
    "it is the time coordinate that has discrete spectrum .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath28 are @xmath43 with a wave function representation in the position basis @xmath44    to obtain the density of states one imposes periodic boundary conditions in a box of size @xmath32 , leading to @xmath45 using the ( large @xmath46 ) asymptotic expansion @xmath47 leads for large @xmath29 to @xmath48 this can not be satisfied in @xmath49 limit .",
    "it means that the density of states vanishes for large @xmath29 .    for arbitrary values of @xmath29 the exact density of states",
    "may be obtained from eqs.([2.6 ] ) or ( [ 2.12 ] ) . however , to obtain a simpler , approximate , form for the density of states it is convenient to use the representation of a subalgebra .",
    "namely , for the subalgebra @xmath50 ( @xmath51 fixed @xmath52 or @xmath53 ) one may use @xmath54 for the @xmath12 case and @xmath55 for the @xmath11 case .",
    "the states @xmath56 are eigenstates of @xmath57 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath58 periodic boundary conditions for @xmath59 on a box of size @xmath60 implies @xmath61 from @xmath62 one obtains for the density of states @xmath63 the density of states vanishes when @xmath64 in the @xmath65 case and for @xmath12 it diverges at @xmath66 ( which is the upper bound of the momentum in this case ) .",
    "this result is consistent with what has been obtained from the asymptotic form of eqs.([2.6 ] ) and ( [ 2.12 ] ) .",
    "however , the density of states in eqs.([2.20 ] ) is not exact because it is derived from a subalgebra representation , which can not be lifted in this simple form to a full representation of the algebra .",
    "the modification of the phase - space volume implies corresponding modifications of the cross sections . as an example , to be used in the calculations of the next section , consider the reaction @xmath67 at high incident proton energy .    here and in section 3 ,",
    "simple letters are used to denote quantities in the laboratory frame , primed letters for the rest frame of the incident proton and starred letters for the center of mass . using ( [ 2.20 ] ) , the modified part of the phase - space integration in the cross section is @xmath68 at high energies , with quantities in the rest frame of the incident proton , one obtains @xmath69 changing variables and dividing by @xmath70 one obtains the following suppression ( @xmath11 ) or enhancing ( @xmath12 ) function @xmath71 with @xmath72 .",
    "fig.1 is a plot of this function in the @xmath11 ( suppression ) case .",
    "in the sixties , greisen @xcite , zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite have shown that the cosmic microwave background radiation should make the universe opaque to protons of energies @xmath73 @xmath74ev . at these energies",
    "the thermal photons are sufficiently blue - shifted in the proton rest frame to excite baryon resonances and drain the proton s energy via pion production .",
    "this led to the notion of _ gzk - sphere _ as being the sphere within which a source has to lie to supply us with protons at @xmath75ev .",
    "later , more accurate calculations , using state - of - the - art particle physics data , placed the energy limit of cosmic ( not arising from local sources ) protons at around @xmath76ev . that is , if the proton sources are at cosmological distances ( @xmath73 @xmath77 mpc ) , the observed spectrum should display a ( gzk ) cutoff around this energy .",
    "a similar limit applies to the nuclei component of the cosmic ray flux .",
    "this situation was upset by the detection of a number of events above @xmath75ev without any plausible local sources @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "discrepancies between the fluxes measured by different groups @xcite @xcite and analysis of the combined data @xcite do not yet allow for a clear - cut statement as to whether the gzkcutoff is indeed violated , a question that will hopefully be clarified by the forthcoming auger observatory .",
    "meanwhile a number of possible explanations for the violation of the gzk  cutoff has appeared on the literature ( for a review see @xcite ) . here",
    "i analyze the effect of the space - time non - commutativity on the calculation of the gzk cutoff and , when ( and if ) such cutoff is confirmed , what inferences can be taken concerning the value of @xmath5 and the sign @xmath6 .",
    "simple letters are used to denote quantities in the lab ( earth ) frame , primed letters for the rest frame of the proton and starred letters for the center of mass . the fractional energy loss due to interactions with the cosmic background radiation ( at zero redshift )",
    "is given by the integral of the nucleon energy loss per collision multiplied by the probability per unit time for a nucleon - photon collision in an isotropic gas of photons at temperature @xmath78 .",
    "therefore the lifetime of a cosmic ray of energy @xmath79 is @xcite , @xmath80 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the photon energy in the nucleon rest frame and the inelasticity @xmath83 is the average energy lost by the photon for the channel @xmath84 with threshold @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is the total cross section of the @xmath87-th interaction channel and @xmath88 the lorentz factor of the nucleon @xmath89 .    in ( [ 3.1 ] ) one may change the order of integration @xmath90 and compute one of the integrals .. to obtain the cosmic ray lifetime @xmath91 in the non - commutative case , one multiplies the cross section by the suppression factor @xmath92 ( eq.([2.23 ] ) ) .",
    "finally , changing variables @xmath93 one obtains the following ratio for each channel contribution @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "this ratio was estimated for the single pion reaction ( [ 2.20a ] ) using @xmath96 mev , @xmath97 and the following parametrization @xcite for the cross section @xmath98 with @xmath99 , @xmath100 in gev s .",
    "this is a parametrization for the @xmath101 total cross section in the range @xmath53gev@xmath102gev . of course",
    ", to compute the absolute value of @xmath103 this would not be appropriate . instead",
    ", due account should be taken of all the resonances contributions .",
    "however for the ratio @xmath104 it gives , at least , qualitative information on the order of magnitude of the effect .    in fig.2 the results for @xmath104 are shown for @xmath11 and @xmath105 in the range @xmath106 to @xmath107 mev , that is , @xmath5 in the range @xmath108 fermi or @xmath109 seconds .    to estimate the effect that this lifetime extending factors have on the energy attenuation of cosmic rays on route to earth , i have used the @xmath110 values found in @xcite for a @xmath111 ev nucleon and computed the integration @xmath112 the results are shown in fig .",
    "one sees that whereas the value of the gzk cutoff  is not much changed , the radius of the gzk sphere is increased allowing for nucleons from distances beyond @xmath77 mpc to reach earth at energies above @xmath113 ev .",
    "if the observation of the ultra high energy cosmic rays is indeed a manifestation of the non - commutative structure two conclusions may be taken :    - first , that the sign @xmath6 is @xmath114 , that is , space is continuous and time discrete .    - second , that for the effect to be significant at current cosmic ray energies , the time quantum must be @xmath115 seconds , much larger than planck scale times .",
    "some experiments in atomic physics are now sensitive to small frequency shifts below 1 mhz . with such sensitivity ,",
    "non - commutative space - time effects might be detected at low energies , especially if small energy shifts have a qualitative impact . here such a possibility is analyzed by looking at the effect of the non - commutative algebra on the spectrum of the coulomb problem .",
    "consider the hamiltonian    @xmath116    and use , for the non - commutative coordinates and momenta , the representation listed in the appendix . both cases ( @xmath12 and @xmath11 ) will be considered",
    ".    from ( [ a.3 ] ) one obtains ( setting @xmath117 ) @xmath118    therefore @xmath119    for small @xmath5 , ( small @xmath120 ) one obtains @xmath121 in this approximation @xmath122 , therefore @xmath123 which may be rewritten @xmath124 with @xmath125    using the fourier transform @xmath126 and the relations @xmath127 one obtains a configuration space representation of eq.([4.5 ] ) , namely @xmath128 the first two terms are the usual coulomb hamiltonian and the third is the order @xmath129 correction arising from the non - commutative structure .",
    "@xmath130 where @xmath131 .",
    "for the @xmath11 case one uses the same representation with the replacements @xmath132 , to obtain @xmath133 then @xmath134 and for small @xmath135@xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 the conclusion being that for the @xmath11 case the order @xmath129 correction differs from the @xmath12 case by a sign change .",
    "\\1 ) a non - commutative space - time structure and two constants of nature @xmath5 and @xmath6 emerge as natural consequences of deformation - theory and stability of the fundamental physical theories . among other effects , this structure implies a modification of phase - space volume which , in particular , has a bearing on the calculation of the gzk sphere .",
    "lorentz invariance is preserved .",
    "\\3 ) in addition to changing the cross sections of elementary processes , phase - space counting rules have statistical mechanics consequences which might have had a relevant effect at the first stages of the universe evolution .",
    "\\4 ) phase - space volume modifications , time and space coordinates spectra and modifications of the uncertainty relations are consequences of the non - commutative space - time structure which depend only on its algebraic structure . in this sense",
    "they are very robust and provide unambiguous tests of the theory .",
    "other consequences might depend on the particular geometric construction that is built on top of the algebraic structure .",
    "for example , for a particular geometrical construction @xcite the existence of additional components on gauge fields is an intriguing consequence .      for specific calculations",
    "it is convenient to use a representation of the space - time algebra ( @xmath140 case ) in the space of functions on the upper sheet of the cone @xmath141 , with coordinates @xmath142 the invariant measure for which the functions are square - integrable being @xmath143      for the @xmath145 case , one may work out a similar representation on the @xmath146 cone with coordinates @xmath147 alternatively we may use the above representation multiplying @xmath148 by @xmath149 , @xmath150 by @xmath151 and replacing @xmath120 by @xmath152 .",
    "it is easily seen from ( [ 1.1 ] ) that the correct commutation relations , for the @xmath153 case , are obtained ."
