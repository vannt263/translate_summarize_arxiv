    "the interrelation between supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and their host galaxies is a central issue of astrophysics today .",
    "the unexpectedly tight correlation between the mass of smbhs ( @xmath6 ) and the velocity dispersion ( @xmath9 ) or mass of their host bulges ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests that the two coevolve , or at least strongly influence each other .",
    "the observed scatter in the @xmath10 relation is explained almost solely by measurement errors @xcite .",
    "such a tight correlation suggests a fine - tuning process , perhaps a combination of internal physics within galaxies or dark halos , and mass averaging via successive mergers as predicted in hierarchical galaxy formation models ( see the recent review by * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . among the possible physical processes that can drive the co - evolution of smbhs and host galaxies ,",
    "the most compelling today is negative feedback caused by active galactic nuclei ( agns ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been suggested that the energy input from agns , which may have been triggered along with active starbursts by interactions / mergers of gas - rich galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , could quench star formation in the host galaxies by expelling the cold gas from galaxies ( quasar - mode feedback ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) strongly suggest that agns have significant impact on their host galaxies",
    ". however , all these arguments are only circumstantial evidence for the putative agn feedback .",
    "stellar populations of agn hosts are expected to provide a key piece of information , since the end effect of agn feedback should appear in stellar properties .",
    "one of the earliest studies of the stellar populations of quasar hosts was presented by @xcite who found that the off - nucleus spectrum of the quasar 3c 48 was dominated by hot young stars .",
    "@xcite analyzed imaging data of nearby seyfert 1s and found that near - infrared colors of their hosts are similar to those of moderately luminous starburst galaxies and that host luminosity is positively correlated with agn luminosity .",
    "@xcite , studying radio - loud and radio - quiet quasars at @xmath12 , discovered that the quasars reside in luminous galaxies whose optical colors are consistent with late - type spirals and irregular galaxies .",
    "more recent studies have benefited greatly from the advent of _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , since resolution of the host galaxies from extremely bright nucleus is the key to accurate quantification of host properties .",
    "@xcite showed that luminous quasars reside preferentially in luminous galaxies with diverse morphology .",
    "the excess detection of close companions , tidal features , and dense surrounding environments led them to conclude that gravitational interactions are important in triggering quasar activity .",
    "in addition , @xcite found that quasar hosts are 0.51.0 mag bluer in @xmath13 than normal galaxies  a sign of active star formation connected to quasars . on the other hand , @xcite claimed that quasars are almost exclusively hosted by massive ellipticals ( the mean half - light radius was found to be @xmath110 kpc ) with @xmath14 colors consistent with old stellar populations .",
    "at least part of the discrepancy between the bahcall et al . and",
    "mclure et al .",
    "results may be attributed to the different filter choices and different modeling methods . at higher redshifts up to @xmath15 , @xcite showed that blue ultraviolet colors of host galaxies indicate recent starburst or ongoing star formation activity , which was later reconfirmed using spatially decomposed spectra by @xcite . a similar result in terms of enhanced blue light in quasar host galaxies",
    "was also obtained by @xcite .",
    "recently , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has revolutionized this field via detection of large samples of narrow - line agns with low ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and high ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) luminosity . in these obscured populations ,",
    "the host galaxies are much more easily observed than in unobscured objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "obscured agns have also been investigated with x - ray observations at redshifts up to @xmath16 and above ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "overall , the above studies are consistent in finding that obscured agns reside preferentially in massive galaxies whose colors are systematically bluer than those of normal galaxies with similar stellar mass .",
    "of particular note is the highest agn fraction in the green valley of the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) as claimed by some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is consistent with ( but not necessarily indicative of ) a scenario in which agns are responsible for transforming blue star - forming galaxies into red quiescent galaxies .",
    "agns found in post - starburst galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may represent this stage .",
    "there are also some indications that higher - luminosity agns reside in bluer galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which seems to contradict the idea that negative agn feedback on star formation is concurrent with the period of highest nuclear activity .",
    "at the same time , detailed analyses of obscured quasars have revealed the presence of significant amount of scattered quasar light in host galaxies @xcite .",
    "if not handled properly , this could result in a serious bias in which the hosts of more luminous agns are observed to be bluer , since the agn spectral energy distribution is usually much bluer than that of starlight .",
    "despite the above intense efforts , one of the biggest pieces of the puzzle still missing is the general nature of galaxies hosting  classical \" quasars , i.e. , hosts of optically - luminous unobscured quasars . since different types of agn",
    "may have different hosts and may play different roles in galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is critically important to study the hosts of all types . the simplest agn unification model ( see the review article of * ?",
    "* ) assumes that unobscured ( type-1 ) and obscured ( type-2 ) agns are intrinsically the same except for the orientation of the obscuring material relative to the observer s line - of - sight , but the actual situation is likely to be more complicated .",
    "for example , obscured agns are more likely to be embedded in dusty circumnuclear environments than are unobscured ones @xcite . in the merger - driven evolution scenario of galaxies and smbhs described by @xcite , the dusty starburst / agn phase ( sometimes observed as ultra - luminous infrared galaxies , ulirgs ) precedes the dust - free phase observed as optically luminous quasars ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case , then obscured and unobscured agns would represent different stages of galaxy evolution .",
    "in this work , we present a statistical analysis of host galaxies of luminous unobscured quasars at low redshifts ( @xmath0 ) . by making use of the deep co -",

    "we make use of the deep stacked images of stripe 82 , the 2.5@xmath21-wide ( in declination ) stripe on the celestial equator from about 20@xmath22 to 6@xmath22 ( in right ascension ) .",
    "those images have been created by co - adding multiple scans of the stripe obtained through sdss - i and the supernova survey @xcite .",

    "reduce the number of the quasars by about 6 % and result in our initial sample of 1041 objects .",
    "although sky subtraction has been already done for the co - added images , we found that the background values around some of the quasars have positive or negative offset levels .",
    "this may be due to residual sky subtraction issues in sdss photometric processing , as described in @xcite .",
    "we measure this local offset by iterative @xmath47-clipping within the 100 pixel @xmath41 100 pixel image cutout , and correct for it .",
    "we fit the azimuthal - average radial profile of each object , @xmath48 , with an optimized combination of the psf and the @xcite function ( a concise reference to the srsic function is found in * ? ? ?",
    "we do not use a more complicated procedure like two - dimensional fitting in this study , partly due to the image quality of sdss ( which is significantly worse than those of _",

    "the pixel coordinates of the quasar centroid are obtained from the celestial coordinates listed in the original quasar catalogs and the astrometric calibration stored in the header of the co - added images ( ` fpc ` frames ) .",
    "the psf at the position of each source in each band is extracted from the relevant sdss measurements ( contained in the ` psfield ` products ) ; in the sdss data processing , the psf in each ccd frame was determined from 1520 bright stars using the karhunen ",

    "the srsic index @xmath44 describes the overall profile shape .",
    "the constant @xmath54 is uniquely determined once @xmath51 and @xmath44 are given , so that @xmath51 meets its definition as the half - light radius . therefore the fitting procedure involves four free parameters of two profile components ; @xmath49 ( psf ) and @xmath52 , @xmath44 , @xmath51 ( the srsic function ) .",
    "the srsic function is convolved with the corresponding psf to accommodate the effect of seeing .",
    "the object s radial profile @xmath48 is measured in bins one pixel wide , i.e. , in annuli with the inner / outer radii of @xmath44/@xmath45 ( @xmath55 ) pixels centered on the object , out to the pixel scale corresponding to 30 kpc at the object s distance .",
    "the associated error is estimated from the root mean square ( rms ) of the data values in each bin .",

    "we keep track of all the discarded objects in each band throughout the fitting procedure for later discussion .    in order to minimize parameter degeneracy and/or physically unreasonable regions of parameter space ,",
    "we carry out the fitting analysis in two steps as follows .",
    "the first step is conducted in the @xmath3 band to determine the values of @xmath44 and @xmath51 of each galaxy .",
    "the choice of @xmath3 band is made since the quasar - to - galaxy contrast is in general lower at longer wavelength ( i.e. , galaxies are redder than quasars ) , making the galaxy component more visible , and the sdss signal - to - noise ratio is much better in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath3 bands than in the other two bands .",
    "also , the seeing tends to be better at longer wavelengths .",
    "@xmath49 is tentatively calculated by assuming that the source profile has negligible contribution from the srsic component at @xmath56 pixel .",
    "then we subtract the psf from the source and fit the residual profile at @xmath57 pixel with the srsic function .",
    "we discard those objects whose residual flux is less than 10 % of the subtracted psf flux . the srsic amplitude @xmath52 is varied freely , while @xmath44 and @xmath51 are changed among values on a pre - fixed grid",
    "; @xmath44 can take ten values logarithmically stepped from 0.5 to 4.0 , and @xmath51 can take twenty values linearly stepped from 1 to 20 kpc .",
    "we also conducted the above procedure in the @xmath23 band and cross - compared the results with those in the @xmath3 band , as shown in figure [ fig : stat_initfit ] .",
    "clearly , the total fluxes contained in the srsic functions of the two bands correlate fairly well despite the presence of scatter in intrinsic galaxy color , while none of the individual free parameters @xmath44 , @xmath51 , or @xmath52 shows better correlation .",
    "this suggests that our approach works well to reproduce the overall flux of the non - psf component , even if the individual parameters are not constrained very accurately .",
    "second , we use the @xmath44 and @xmath51 values determined above ( in the @xmath3 band ) and fit the combined psf plus srsic function to the observed profile in each band by varying @xmath49 and @xmath52 simultaneously .",
    "we show one of the good fitting results in figure [ fig : proffit ] to illustrate our procedure ; this is the same object as shown in figure [ fig : snapshot ] .",
    "the distribution of the reduced @xmath58 values of the best fits peaks around 1 and is fairly close to the expected @xmath58 distribution in all the five bands , as shown in figure [ fig : chi2 ] , suggesting that our model reproduces the observed source profiles reasonably well .",
    "we measure the galaxy flux ( @xmath59 ) by integrating the best - fit srsic function out to @xmath60 kpc and the quasar flux ( @xmath61 ) by integrating the psf .",
    "these are corrected for the galactic extinction taken from @xcite . those fitting results",
    "whose estimated errors in galaxy flux exceed 2.5 mag are discarded ; they are at the tail of the error distribution , as most ( about 70 % in the @xmath2 band and more than 95 % in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 bands ) of the objects with successful fits have galaxy flux errors of less than 0.5 mag .    for robust estimates of the galaxy @xmath34-correction and ( stellar ) mass - to - light ratio , we need to know the spectral energy distribution of each galaxy reasonably well . to this end , we require that the fitting results be available in at least three of the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bands ( this is called the  good - fit criterion \" hereafter ) .",
    "we decided not to consider the @xmath2-band results for further analysis , since the galaxy component is not visible in many objects in this band due to low signal - to - noise ratio and high quasar - to - galaxy contrast .",
    "figure [ fig : stat ] shows the number statistics of the initial sample and the fraction of the good - fit objects as a function of redshift and magnitude .",
    "the good - fit fraction decreases toward higher redshift and fainter magnitude , as expected , dropping to nearly 50% at @xmath62 , @xmath63 mag , or @xmath64 mag .",
    "the most luminous objects also tend to fail in the fitting because of the highest quasar - to - galaxy contrasts , but they are only a small fraction of the whole sample . in total , 802 quasars or 77 % of the initial sample meet the good - fit criterion . for these objects , we estimate the absolute magnitudes and mass - to - luminosity ratios of the host galaxies using the public @xmath34-correction code ` kcorrect ` , version 4.2 @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we express the absolute magnitudes of the host galaxies in the sdss @xmath23 and @xmath3 bands shifted to @xmath65 , which are denoted as @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the color in these shifted bandpasses is @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath66 @xmath70 @xmath67 . roughly speaking , the bandpasses of @xmath66 and @xmath67 are close to those of the original sdss @xmath2 and @xmath24 bands , respectively .",
    "the median conversion factor from @xmath67 to stellar mass @xmath8 is found to be log @xmath71 .",
    "note that quasar absolute magnitudes are always @xmath34-corrected to @xmath35 in this work .      here",
    "we estimate systematic errors arising from the above procedure with simulated quasar images .",
    "we first select about 1300 galaxies on stripe 82 from the sdss dr10 @xcite database , in such a way that they are distributed fairly uniformly in the space of redshift and @xmath72 color in the range @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "although most of the dr10 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts at @xmath36 are red , with passive stellar population , we were able to find a sufficient number of blue galaxies that cover the redshift and color distributions of the real quasar hosts ( see below ) .",
    "the galaxies ( with sdss model magnitudes @xmath75 ) are extracted from the same imaging data as used in the above analysis , and their flux scales are reduced so that the resultant galaxy magnitudes become @xmath76 where @xmath77 mag .",
    "since this procedure also reduces background noise , we add additional random gaussian noise that restores the amplitude of the original background fluctuation .",
    "next we randomly pick a bright star from the sdss stripe 82 standard star catalog @xcite for each of the above galaxies , and add its image to the dimmed galaxy image by aligning the source centroids . in order to reproduce a range of quasar - to - galaxy contrast , the stellar flux is reduced to @xmath78 where @xmath79 mag and @xmath80 is a random variable between @xmath81 and @xmath82 mag .",
    "these superimposed galaxy @xmath83 star images comprise our synthesized quasar images , which are processed through the same analysis algorithm as used for the real quasar sample .",
    "for simplicity in the rest of this subsection , we denote the input and output galaxy magnitudes by @xmath84 ( @xmath85 above ) and @xmath42 , respectively , and the input and output quasar magnitudes by @xmath86 ( @xmath87 above ) and @xmath88 , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : simulation1 ] shows the success rate of the fitting procedure for the simulated quasars ( the fraction of the simulated quasars meeting the good - fit criterion defined in the previous subsection ) on a few projection planes of the parameter space .",
    "the distribution of real quasars is superposed .",
    "the success rate is most strongly dependent on galaxy magnitude ; the fitting tends to fail for galaxies fainter than @xmath89 mag . on the other hand , it is less dependent on redshift or galaxy color @xmath90 at fixed galaxy magnitude .",
    "for faint galaxies with @xmath91 mag , the success rate is higher at higher quasar - to - galaxy contrast , because the brighter quasar light helps to pass the signal - to - noise ratio cut in the analysis algorithm .",
    "finally , on the galaxy cmd of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , the success rate decreases toward the lower - luminous and redder region where galaxies have the lowest apparent brightness in the optical bands .",
    "we suspect that the real quasars that fail to meet the good - fit criterion , which comprise @xmath123 % of the initial sample , fall in those particular regions of the parameter space with low success rates .",
    "the fraction of real quasars with successful fits drops in the transition area between the high and low success rates of the simulation , suggesting that the present simulation reproduces the behavior of the real quasar hosts reasonably well .",
    "the next question is how accurately the host galaxy brightness is measured for those real quasars with successful fits .",
    "we extract the simulated quasars in the parameter subspace where most of the real quasars with successful fits are found , i.e. , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , and compare the input and output magnitudes ( @xmath84 and @xmath42 ) of the host galaxies .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : simulation2 ] .",
    "the two sets of magnitudes are fairly consistent with each other , with systematic offsets and rms scatters measured to be @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 .",
    "the derived absolute magnitudes also show slight systematic offsets from their correct values , which we found are weakly correlated with quasar - to - galaxy contrast ( shown in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : simulation2 ] ) .",
    "this is presumably caused by two competing effects ; some of the galaxy light close to the nuclei can be attributed wrongly to the quasar component ( making @xmath102 positive ) , while quasar light contaminates into host galaxies more severely when the quasar - to - galaxy contrast is higher ( making @xmath102 negative ) . however , this systematic error is small compared to the accuracy on which our conclusions stand , and we will see that correcting for it as a function of the quasar - to - galaxy contrast has little effect on our conclusions . similarly , the systematic error of the derived absolute color ( @xmath103 mag in median ) is too small to affect any of our conclusions .",
    "we show the quasar - to - galaxy contrasts and associated magnitude differences as a function of redshift and quasar luminosity for the real quasars in figure [ fig : qgcontrast ] . here",
    "all the successful fitting results in each band are included , regardless of the good - fit criterion .",
    "the median values of the contrasts ( quasar brightness relative to galaxy brightness ) in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) bands are ( 28.4 , 14.2 , 7.3 , 5.8 , 5.1 ) in peak intensity ratios and ( 7.5 , 4.0 , 1.6 , 1.2 , 1.0 ) in integrated flux ratios , respectively . as expected , the contrast is significantly higher in the bluer bands . while its correlation with redshift is relatively weak , that with the quasar luminosity ( corresponding to @xmath61 ) is remarkably strong .",
    "the slopes at @xmath104 mag are close to the vector of constant @xmath59 , meaning that @xmath61 and @xmath59 are primarily independent of each other .",
    "@xcite found a similar lack of correlation between nuclear and host luminosities for seyfert galaxies at low redshifts ( @xmath105 ) . in our sample ,",
    "the correlations flatten out at the higher luminosity where the fitting starts to fail for the highest - contrast objects .",
    "indeed , the actual contrasts would presumably be higher and bluer than estimated here if we had proper measurements of those highest - contrast objects .",
    "although the sdss psf magnitudes are commonly used to quantify the quasar brightness , they are found to be ( 0.33 , 0.39 , 0.51 , 0.54 , 0.61 ) mag brighter in median than the decomposed quasar magnitudes in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) bands .",
    "the systematic difference is larger for lower - luminosity quasars . on the other hand ,",
    "the host brightness is sometimes approximated by the sdss model flux minus the sdss psf flux .",
    "we convert this quantity into magnitude @xmath106 , which is found to be ( 0.28 , 0.33 , 0.68 , 0.82 , 0.81 ) mag fainter than the decomposed galaxy magnitudes in median in the ( @xmath2 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) bands .",
    "the discrepancy increases as the quasar luminosity increases .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd ] shows the cmd of the host galaxies .",
    "the approximate stellar mass is shown on the upper axis , using the conversion described at the end of section [ subsec : imageanalysis ] . the distribution of normal galaxies from the sdss spectroscopic sample at @xmath73 , taken from the mpa - jhu dr7 catalog , is also shown for reference .",
    "we note that their redshift distribution is not well matched to that of the quasar host galaxies ; about 80 % of the reference sample is at @xmath107 where very few of the quasar hosts are found .",
    "if we limit to @xmath36 , there is not a large and complete enough sample of normal galaxies in sdss to serve as a good reference in this cmd .",
    "the median @xmath67 and @xmath68 values of the reference sample at each redshift are plotted in the figure .",
    "we also plot the mpa - jhu galaxies at lower redshifts ( @xmath108 ) in order to show the location of the blue cloud in the local universe ( the blue cloud is not clear at higher redshifts due to the limited depth of sdss ) .",
    "the hosts of our quasars occupy a unique location in this diagram ; they are almost exclusively massive with @xmath109 , and have colors ranging from the blue cloud to below the bottom of the red sequence . compared to the majority of the normal galaxies with similar stellar mass",
    ", those quasar hosts are forming stars much more efficiently .",
    "although objects with different quasar power ( measured by the [ ] @xmath1105007 luminosity @xmath111}$ ] ) are well mixed with each other , there seems to be a slight offset between the higher- and lower-@xmath111}$ ] objects .",
    "we will return to this issue later .    with the decomposed galaxy components in hand",
    ", we can also check the relation between the mass of smbhs and the host luminosity ( stellar mass ) .",
    "they are plotted in figure [ fig : magorrian ] .",
    "although the data points show significant scatter , there is a clear positive correlation between the two quantities .",
    "thus we have recovered the @xmath7 relation in optically luminous quasars .",
    "the best - fit linear relation is @xmath112 or @xmath113 compared to the local @xmath7 relation of quiescent galaxies @xcite , those quasar hosts are found to be under - massive for a given smbh mass .",
    "considering that our fitting procedure tends to fail for less - luminous host galaxies , this trend may be even stronger than appears in figure [ fig : magorrian ] . as shown in the figure",
    ", this result hardly changes when we correct for the systematic errors of @xmath67 as a function of the measured quasar - to - galaxy contrast ( see section [ subsec : simulation ] ) .",
    "however , the relation measured here could be subject to serious selection effects and other observational biases , as discussed below .",
    "the simulations we carried out in section [ subsec : simulation ] show that the measured host galaxy magnitudes are only slightly biased . in this subsection",
    "we explore this further , by looking for trends in the observed data that might indicate contamination of the galaxy light from the quasar .",
    "there are two possible causes of such a contamination .",
    "one is imperfect nucleus / host decomposition of the source profile , due to the limited precision of the psf estimation and/or the fact that the galaxy may not be perfectly fit by a srsic profile .",
    "our fits may tend to overestimate the srsic component since the srsic , with three parameters , has more flexibility to fit a given profile than does the psf .",
    "on the other hand , if there is a compact stellar core at the galactic center on top of the srsic profile , such as a nuclear starburst , then it would be included in the psf and lead to underestimation of the galaxy component . these two effects bias the measured host brightness in opposite directions .",
    "the other possible cause of the contamination is scattering of quasar light by the interstellar medium of the host galaxy . unlike the first effect",
    ", this is an astrophysical effect and is an interesting subject in itself .",
    "contamination of quasar light in the photometry of host galaxies , originating from either of these effects , would reveal itself most clearly in colors , since quasars are much bluer than galaxies in general .",
    "however , as we find in figure [ fig : gmicor ] , the color distributions of the decomposed quasars ( psf components ) and host galaxies ( srsic components ) seem to be uncorrelated .",
    "the variation of the mean galaxy colors is only about @xmath114 mag as the quasar colors change by 3 mag .",
    "note that the slight positive correlation of the quasar and galaxy colors is expected , since our fitting analysis tends to fail for the bluest quasars with the reddest hosts due to high quasar - to - galaxy contrast in the @xmath23 band .",
    "furthermore , we have already seen that the magnitudes and colors of galaxies hosting the quasars with a range of [ ] luminosity are relatively well mixed ( see fig [ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "these facts imply that quasar light contamination is not a large effect .",
    "a straightforward way to check the effect of the imperfect nucleus / host decomposition is to compare the measured host properties of quasars with and without measurable nuclear contribution . to this end",
    ", we compare the host magnitudes and colors of our sample to those of sdss type-2 ( obscured ) quasars @xcite as shown in figure [ fig : fscattered_type12 ] .",
    "the redshifts of both samples are limited to @xmath115 ( where most of our sample is located ) for this comparison .",
    "the lack of type-2 quasars at low [ ] luminosity is due to the luminosity threshold imposed by reyes et al .",
    "( @xmath111 } \\ga 10^{41.9}$ ] erg s@xmath18 ) .",
    "it is seen that the type-2 quasars are up to 0.5 mag more luminous than the hosts of type-1 objects . since",
    "this excess brightness is higher at higher quasar luminosity , it may be due to quasar light scattered at the central part of the galaxy or nuclear starburst associated with agn , which are included in the psf component for the type-1 objects",
    ". if it has a stellar origin , then the magnitudes ( stellar mass ) of our quasar hosts could be under - estimated by @xmath116 mag ( @xmath117 dex ) . however , such a small reduction in host stellar mass does nt change any of our conclusions significantly . on the other hand ,",
    "the colors of the two types of quasars are almost perfectly consistent with each other , suggesting that our approach is very efficient in eliminating the nuclear contribution to host colors .",
    "the weak anti - correlation between the colors and [ ] luminosity can be explained by either agn - associated star formation or scattered quasar light .    currently the most reliable way to quantify",
    "the scattered quasar light is via polarimetric measurements .",
    "based on the optical broadband- and spectro - polarimetric observations of sdss type-2 quasars , @xcite confirmed the presence of significant amounts of scattered quasar light in host galaxies , and suggested a typical scattering efficiency of @xmath118 % .",
    "as a trial we re - calculated the absolute magnitudes and colors of our quasar hosts assuming @xmath119 % ( i.e. , we subtracted 1 % of the decomposed psf flux from the srsic flux before the @xmath34-correction ) , and found that the median values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the hosts change only by @xmath120 and @xmath121 mag , respectively .",
    "this is not surprising indeed , since the median quasar - to - galaxy contrasts of integrated flux are at most 4 in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bands ; only 1 % of the quasar brightness can not make a significant impact on the host brightness . in the extreme case of @xmath122 % ,",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 would become larger than their original values by @xmath830.10 mag and @xmath830.21 mag , respectively .",
    "however , no compelling evidence for such a high scattering efficiency has been reported to date .",
    "hence we conclude that the scattered quasar light has no significant impact on our results .",
    "figure [ fig : cmd ] demonstrates that the quasars of our sample are preferentially hosted by massive ( @xmath123 ) galaxies with active star formation .",
    "massive hosts have also been found for less luminous , narrow - line agns in the sdss spectroscopic sample at lower redshifts ( @xmath107 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note that our fitting analysis fails for about 23 % of the initial sample , most of which are too faint to give sufficient signal - to - noise ratios in the combined quasar and galaxy profiles .",
    "these faint sources could have systematically different host properties from those plotted in figure [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that massive star - forming hosts are a common property of the majority , if not all , of low-@xmath4 ( @xmath0 ) sdss quasars . at lower luminosity ( @xmath124 mag ) and lower redshifts ( @xmath125 ) , @xcite reached a very similar conclusion to ours .",
    "their method of agn / host decomposition depends critically on the assumption that the agn hosts have the same morphological structure as inactive galaxies on average , while our approach fit for the surface brightness profile of the hosts directly .",
    "it is obvious that our conclusions do not apply to any quasar populations that are not included in the sdss sample .",
    "however , the completeness of the sdss selection for unobscured quasars is estimated to be fairly high ; @xcite reported an overall completeness of about 89 % or higher to a limiting magnitude of @xmath126 mag ( corresponding to the limiting magnitude of the sdss - i selection for low-@xmath4 quasars ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , stripe 82 has been observed for quasars more completely than any other area of the sdss coverage using a variety of variability and color selection algorithms @xcite .",
    "hence our conclusions may be generalized to all those unobscured quasars whose luminosity and redshifts are covered by the present sample .",
    "previous studies of narrow - line agns at low redshifts ( @xmath107 , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have already found that the fraction of agns is higher in the blue cloud and the green valley than in the red sequence on the cmd .",
    "@xcite found that the hosts of their low - luminosity type-2 agns have similar stellar content to normal early - type galaxies , while those of the high - luminosity agns have much younger stellar populations .",
    "@xcite reported that the hosts of the most powerful agns in their sample have comparable stellar mass and star formation rates ( sfrs ) to galaxies at the massive end of the blue cloud , while those of the weaker agns have considerably lower sfrs , extending into the red sequence .",
    "our finding of almost no quasar hosts on the red sequence is consistent with these results , as the quasars are an - order - of - magnitude higher - luminosity ( measured by @xmath111}$ ] ) counterparts to the narrow - line agns studied by the above authors .",
    "the bluer hosts of more active agns might point to the presence of agn - induced star formation predicted in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , studies of optically faint x - ray agns at redshifts similar to or larger than those of our sample ( up to @xmath127 ) have found that their hosts are preferentially in the green valley and the red sequence ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this may suggest that different agn types are hosted by different types of galaxies .",
    "if the optically luminous quasars and x - ray agns are on a single evolutionary path of hosts transiting from the blue cloud to the red sequence , then our result might suggest that optically luminous quasars precede x - ray agns in an evolutionary sequence ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "according to the merger - driven co - evolution scenario of galaxies and smbhs @xcite , interactions / mergers of gas - rich galaxies first activate star formation and agn , and then produce a dust - obscured , ir - luminous phase sometimes observed as ulirgs .",
    "the narrow - line agn phase may then follow .",
    "the systems further go into an optically luminous quasar phase when the dust is expelled by radiation pressure and the active nuclei become visible , and finally migrate into the red sequence as quasar and star - forming activity fades away .",
    "the blue host colors we found support the idea that quasars coincide with active star formation in host galaxies .",
    "although the quasar - driven quenching of star formation ( negative agn feedback ) has been proposed by many authors , such a process never becomes apparent in stellar properties during the most optically - luminous ( i.e. , quasar ) phase of agns .",
    "some authors suggest that the apparent clustering of agn hosts in the green valley and the red sequence is due to selection effects ; if one works with a stellar mass - limited sample instead of a flux - limited sample , then the agn fraction in the blue cloud would become comparably high to other regions of the cmd @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite argue that most of the green agn hosts have colors consistent with dusty star - forming galaxies and their intrinsic ( dust - corrected ) colors are located in the blue cloud .",
    "these studies point to a larger fraction of blue hosts than previously thought for obscured agns .",
    "if the above effects are also present in our analysis , then it would further strengthen our conclusion that quasar hosts are bluer and forming stars more efficiently than are the majority of normal galaxies .    in figure",
    "[ fig : reddvssfr ] , we plot the host colors versus the quasar eddington ratios ( @xmath128 ) in order to further investigate the possible interrelation between nuclear and star - forming activity .",
    "very roughly speaking , the vertical axis corresponds to @xmath129 times the logarithm of specific sfr ( @xmath129 log [ sfr/@xmath130 ) with a constant offset since log sfr @xmath131 log ( uv luminosity ) @xmath132 @xmath83 constant and log @xmath133 log ( red optical / nir luminosity ) @xmath134 @xmath83 constant .",
    "if one assumes that the @xmath7 relation holds at every epoch of galaxy evolution ( i.e. , @xmath135 ( t ) at every time @xmath136 ) , then @xmath137 the eddington ratio and ssfr do show a positive correlation in figure [ fig : reddvssfr ] , but the slope is much shallower than expected from equation ( [ eq : reddvssfr ] ) ; ssfr only doubles ( @xmath68 increases by about 0.7 ) as @xmath128 increases by more than a factor of 100 .",
    "this implies that the rise and fall of agn and star formation are not precisely synchronized , although the assembly of smbh and host stars keep pace with each other when averaged over time .",
    "figure [ fig : magorrian ] demonstrates that the hosts of the sdss quasars are under - massive for a given smbh mass compared to the local relation .",
    "the discrepancy becomes larger at smaller mass , resulting in a shallow slope of the @xmath7 relation .",
    "such a systematic difference between the local relation and the relation we found could originate from various effects .",
    "the first is cosmological evolution during the time span of 5.7 gyr between @xmath62 and @xmath138 .",
    "however , we found little redshift evolution of the @xmath139 ratio in the range probed by our sample ( @xmath140 ) as shown in figure [ fig : magorrian_z ] .",
    "the ratio is offset from the local relation by the same amount even at @xmath107 , which casts doubt on the interpretation that the offset is due entirely to evolutionary effects .",
    "the second is an intrinsic difference between active and quiescent galaxies ; although the @xmath6 estimators of active smbhs are calibrated so that the local agns fall on the @xmath7 relation of local quiescent galaxies , it is not clear whether the calibration remains robust at the higher - redshift universe .",
    "the third is selection effects and observational biases , as we now discuss .",
    "previous studies of the relation between @xmath6 and @xmath8 ( or the central stellar dispersion @xmath9 or the spheroid mass @xmath141 ) beyond the local universe are still very controversial .",
    "many observations at @xmath142 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and beyond ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) even up to @xmath143 @xcite suggest that the @xmath6/@xmath141 ratio increases toward high redshift .",
    "our results are qualitatively consistent with these studies , although our @xmath8 includes not only a spheroid but also a disk component if it exists .",
    "attempts have been made to quantify the evolution of the ratio in the form of @xmath6/@xmath141 @xmath144 , but @xmath145 varies significantly from paper to paper ; for example , @xmath146 ( measured at @xmath147 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or @xmath150 ( @xmath151 ; * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath6/@xmath141 increases toward high redshift , this suggests that smbhs grow , or are assembled , earlier than their host galaxies . however , other studies claim no such evolution .",
    "@xcite showed that the local @xmath10 relation holds up to @xmath15 .",
    "using over 900 agns drawn from sdss , @xcite also found no evolution of the @xmath10 relation at @xmath152 .",
    "similar conclusions were reached for agns at @xmath153 by @xcite and at @xmath154 by @xcite .    at least some of the above controversy may be attributed to various observational biases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in a flux - limited sample , quasar luminosity and @xmath6 are systematically larger in higher - redshift objects .",
    "if the @xmath7 relation is not well calibrated at high masses in the local universe , then the @xmath6/@xmath8 ratio would deviate systematically at high redshifts .",
    "if the single - epoch @xmath6 estimators are not accurately calibrated over a wide dynamic range of quasar luminosity , then it would also give rise to a redshift - dependent bias .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the uncertainty in the single - epoch @xmath6 estimates could have a significant impact on the derived @xmath7 relation .",
    "various quality cuts used to select the sample may also result in a redshift - dependent bias . furthermore , for a given galaxy mass , more massive smbhs have higher chance of being selected if they tend to have higher agn luminosity @xcite . when coupled with a bottom - heavy galaxy mass function , this can produce a malmquist - type bias and result in a higher @xmath6/@xmath8 ratio at higher redshifts ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . a similar but different source of bias was pointed out by @xcite , in which the decreasing fraction of active smbhs at higher mass results in a larger fraction of lower - mass smbhs being selected at fixed bulge properties .",
    "they gave a comprehensive discussion of various selection biases and demonstrated that , while the observed departures of the @xmath6/@xmath155 ratio from the local relation are sometimes very large at high redshifts , they could be all attributed to the accumulated effects of various selection biases .",
    "the fundamental problem is that our current knowledge about smbhs beyond the local universe is necessarily based only on agns above a certain observed flux .",
    "we do not really know whether the points in figure [ fig : magorrian ] are representative of , or just a part of the envelope of , the underlying distribution of all the ( active and inactive ) smbhs at the relevant redshifts .",
    "we have analyzed the photometric properties of galaxies hosting optically luminous , unobscured quasars at @xmath0 .",
    "the sample was selected from the fifth sdss quasar catalog @xcite and the first boss quasar catalog @xcite on stripe 82 , where deep co - added sdss images are available .",
    "each quasar image is decomposed into nucleus and host galaxy using the psf and the srsic models .",
    "802 objects ( 77 % of the initially selected sample ) are successfully fitted with our approach in at least three of the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 bands , which constitute our final sample .",
    "we confirmed that the effect of quasar light contamination due to the imperfect nucleus / host decomposition is not very large .",
    "the systematic errors in the measured galaxy absolute magnitudes and colors are estimated to be less than 0.5 mag and 0.1 mag , respectively , with simulated quasar images .",
    "scattered quasar light can not affect host brightness as long as the scattering efficiency is about 1 % or less .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows .    1 .",
    "the sdss quasars are almost exclusively hosted by massive galaxies with @xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of previous studies on less luminous , narrow - line agns .",
    "the quasar hosts are also very blue and almost absent on the red sequence , which is in stark contrast to the color  magnitude distribution of normal galaxies .",
    "the fact that more active agns reside in bluer galaxies may suggest that negative agn feedback , if it exists , is not concurrent with the most optically luminous phase of agn .",
    "2 .   there is a positive correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath8 of the sdss quasars .",
    "however , the @xmath7 relation is offset toward larger @xmath6 or smaller @xmath8 compared to the local relation .",
    "while this could indicate that smbhs are assembled or grow earlier than their host galaxies , we argue that it is not clear whether the sample is representative of the whole active and inactive smbhs at the relevant redshifts due to various observational biases .",
    "the present work demonstrates that luminosity and colors of quasar host galaxies can be extracted from optical multi - band images with moderate spatial resolution",
    ". we will expand the analysis into higher redshifts and lower luminosity with the wide - field imaging data obtained in the coming subaru / hyper suprime - cam ( hsc ) survey , which is scheduled to start in early 2014 .",
    "the wide layer of the hsc survey plans to observe 1400 deg@xmath156 of the sdss footprint with an expected depth of @xmath157 mag ( 5@xmath47 , 2  aperture ) and a psf full width at half maximum of less than 0.7 .",
    "thus these data will significantly supersede sdss both in depth and image quality .",

    "<S> the stellar properties of about 800 galaxies hosting optically luminous , unobscured quasars at @xmath0 are analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> deep co - added sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) images of the quasars on stripe 82 are decomposed into nucleus and host galaxy using point spread function and srsic models.universe the systematic errors in the measured galaxy absolute magnitudes and colors are estimated to be less than 0.5 mag and 0.1 mag , respectively , with simulated quasar images . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of quasar light scattered by the interstellar medium is also carefully addressed . the measured quasar - to - galaxy ratio in total flux decreases toward longer wavelengths , from @xmath18 in the @xmath2 band to @xmath11 in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the sdss quasars are hosted exclusively by massive galaxies ( stellar mass @xmath5 ) , which is consistent with previous results for less luminous narrow - line ( obscured ) active galactic nuclei ( agns ) . </S>",
    "<S> the quasar hosts are very blue and almost absent on the red sequence , showing stark contrast to the color  magnitude distribution of normal galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that more powerful agns reside in galaxies with higher star - formation efficiency may indicate that negative agn feedback , if it exists , is not concurrent with the most luminous phase of agns . </S>",
    "<S> we also find positive correlation between the mass of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ; @xmath6 ) and host stellar mass , but the @xmath7 relation is offset toward large @xmath6 or small @xmath8 compared to the local relation . while this could indicate that smbhs grow earlier than do their host galaxies , such an argument is not conclusive , as the effect may be dominated by observational biases . </S>"
