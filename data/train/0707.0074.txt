    "spekkens introduced a toy theory that demonstrates how a local hidden variable model with a classical information - based restriction can capture a great deal of seemingly quantum phenomena , including non - commutativity of measurement , remote steering and teleportation  @xcite .",
    "spekkens toy model ( stm ) builds upon other information - based models with similar aims @xcite .",
    "although by no means a proposed axiomatization of quantum theory , stm aims to strengthen the view that the quantum state is a statistical distribution over a hidden variable space in which there exists a balance of knowledge and ignorance about the true state of the system .    in this paper , we axiomatize stm , and test it by relaxing its axioms .",
    "we claim that stm can be formalized into five axioms describing valid states , allowable transformations , measurement outcomes , and composition of systems . arguing on empirical grounds , we relax the axiom regarding valid operations on toy bits to obtain larger groups of operations for one and two toy bits . we claim that these larger groups are isomorphic to the projective extended clifford group for one and two qubits respectively .",
    "however , these larger groups of operations contain elements that do not necessarily compose under the tensor product .",
    "that is to say , there exist operations that do not take valid states to valid states when composed under the tensor product , as one would demand of a physical model .",
    "these operations are analogous to positive maps in quantum theory .",
    "just as positive ( but not completely positive ) maps can be used to test whether a quantum state is entangled or not  @xcite , validity - preserving ( but not completely validity - preserving ) maps can be used to test for correlations in the two toy bit stm .",
    "finally , we claim that relaxing the transformations of stm to an epistemic perspective gives rise to physically unreasonable alternatives , and as such , no equivalence with the extended clifford group for two qubits can be established by relaxing stm s operations .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : stm ]",
    ", we present stm as a series of axioms and compare them to the axioms of quantum theory .",
    "we provide a brief review of the original model for an elementary toy system ( a toy bit ) and for two toy bits and provide a number of different ways of representing one and two toy bits . in section  [ sec : relax ] we propose a relaxation of the criterion for valid operations on elementary systems , identify the resulting groups of operations , and analyze both their mathematical and physical properties .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our results in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we present stm in its axiomatic basis and state the axioms of quantum mechanics for comparison . using the axioms of stm we develop several ways of representing toy bits including a vector space , a tetrahedron , and a toy analogue of the bloch sphere .",
    "we also develop two ways of representing two toy bits : a product space and a four - dimensional cube .",
    "we show how states , operations , and tensor products stem from the axioms of stm , and we draw parallels to the equivalent axioms and concepts in quantum theory .",

    "can be answered .",
    "the state a system is actually in is called an ontic state , whereas the state of knowledge is called an epistemic state .",
    "stm can be succinctly summarized using the following axioms :    stm  0 : : :    all systems obey the knowledge balance principle .",
    "stm  1 : : :    a single toy bit is described by a single hidden variable that can be    in 1 of 4 possible states , the _",
    "ontic _ states .",
    "the knowledge balance    principle insists that the hidden variable is known to be in a subset    of 2 or 4 of the ontic states  that subset is the _ epistemic _ state of    the system .",
    "stm  2 : : :    a _ valid reversible operation _ is a permutation of ontic states of the    system that also permutes the epistemic states amongst themselves .",
    "stm  3 : : :    a _ reproducible measurement _ is a partition of the ontic states into a    set of disjoint epistemic states , with the outcome of a measurement    being a specific epistemic state .",
    "the probability of a particular    outcome is proportional to the number of ontic states that outcome has    in common with the current epistemic state . immediately after the    process of measurement ,",
    "the epistemic state of the system is updated    to the outcome of the measurement .",
    "stm  4 : : :    elementary systems compose under the tensor product giving rise to    composite systems ; the knowledge balance principle applies to the    composite system as well as to the parts .    to help make the comparison with quantum theory , the corresponding axioms of quantum mechanics are given below @xcite .",
    "qm  1 : : :    any isolated physical system corresponds to a complex vector space    with an inner product , a _",
    "hilbert space_. a system is completely    described by a ray in hilbert space .",
    "qm  2 : : :    evolution of a closed system is described by a unitary transformation    through the schrdinger equation @xmath0    whereas @xmath1 is a hermitian operator .",
    "qm  3 : : :    measurement is described by a collection , @xmath2 , of    measurement operators .",
    "these are operators acting on the state space    of the system being measured .",
    "the index @xmath3 refers to the    measurement outcomes that may occur in the experiment .",
    "if the state of    the quantum system is @xmath4    immediately before the measurement then the probability that result    @xmath3 occurs is given by @xmath5    and the state after measurement is given by    @xmath6 measurement operators satisfy    @xmath7 . qm  4 : : :    the state space of a composite system is the tensor product of the    state space of the component systems .    the simplest system that can exist is a single toy bit system : there are two yes / no questions in a canonical set , yielding four ontic states , which we label @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 . a pair of ontic states forms the answer to one of the two questions in a canonical set .",
    "the knowledge balance principle restricts us to knowing the answer to at most one of two questions , resulting in a _ pure epistemic state_. the six pure states are shown pictorially in fig .",
    "[ fig : pureepistemic ] .",
    "( in spekkens original notation , the state @xmath12 was denoted @xmath13 . )        by way of example , the questions  is the ontic state in @xmath14 ? \" and  is the ontic state in @xmath15 ? \"",
    "form one particular canonical set .",
    "the epistemic state @xmath16 corresponds to the situation in which the first question can be answered , and it is in the affirmative .",
    "the model also includes a single _ mixed epistemic state _ , namely @xmath17 , corresponding to knowing absolutely nothing about the system .",
    "at this point we introduce the linear represention for the toy model which will be convenient for describing operations later .",
    "let @xmath18 be a basis for a real vector space , and express the epistemic states in that basis .",
    "each pure epistemic state is then a vector with exactly two @xmath19 s and two @xmath20 s ; for example , @xmath21 note that epistemic states that are disjoint ( that is , have no ontic states in common ) are orthogonal as vectors in @xmath22 .    now that states in the toy model are defined , we turn our attention to transformations between states .",
    "stm  2 states that valid operations are permutations of ontic states .",
    "the group of permutations of four objects is denoted @xmath23 , and permutations are usually summarized using cyclic notation ( see @xcite for details ) . by way of example , the permutation @xmath24 maps @xmath8 to @xmath9 , @xmath9 to @xmath10 , @xmath10 to @xmath8 , and @xmath11 to @xmath11 . in terms of epistemic states ,",
    "@xmath24 maps @xmath25 to @xmath26 . in the linear representation , each transformation in @xmath23 is a @xmath27 permutation matrix that acts on the left of the epistemic state vectors .",
    "for example , @xmath28 we call this the _ regular representation _ of @xmath23 , and we will call this description of stm the _ linear model_.    since the group of operations on a single toy bit is such a well - studied group , there are other classical systems of states and transformations that may be readily identified with the single toy bit .",
    "one such system uses a regular tetrahedron . in this geometric representation ,",
    "the vertices of the tetrahedron represent the ontic states of the system , whereas pure epistemic states are represented by edges ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tetrahedron ] ) .",
    "the action of a transformation in @xmath23 , then , is a symmetry operation on the tetrahedron .",
    "for example , the transformation @xmath24 permutes vertices @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 of the tetrahedron by rotating counter - clockwise by @xmath29 about the axes which passes through the center of the tetrahedron and vertex @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath23 is the entire group of permutations of @xmath18 , it is also the complete group of symmetry operations for the regular tetrahedron .",
    "notice that @xmath30 , the alternating group ( or group of even permutations ) , corresponds to the group of rotations , whereas odd permutations correspond to reflections and roto - reflections .    as pointed out by spekkens ,",
    "another way of viewing the single toy bit is using a toy analogue of the bloch sphere . in the toy bloch sphere ,",
    "epistemic states are identified with particular quantum states on the traditional bloch sphere and are embedded in @xmath31 accordingly . in particular , @xmath32 , @xmath26 , and @xmath25",
    "are identified with @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 and are embedded on the positive @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 axes respectively ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bloch ] ) .        states that are orthogonal in the linear model are embedded as antipodal points on the toy bloch sphere , just as orthogonal quantum states are embedded antipodally on the quantum bloch sphere .",
    "distance on the toy bloch sphere corresponds to overlap between states : two epistemic states have an angle of @xmath39 between them if and only if they have exactly one ontic state in common .    on the quantum bloch sphere ,",
    "single qubit transformations are represented by rotations in the group @xmath40 , and they may be characterized using euler rotations . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath41 denotes a rotation about the @xmath36-axis by @xmath42 , then any @xmath43 may be written in the form @xmath44 for example , the rotation by @xmath29 about the @xmath45 axis may be written as @xmath46 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : euler ] ) .     expressed as a series of euler rotations.,width=566 ]    on the toy bloch sphere , in contrast , transformations are elements of @xmath47 , not all of which are rotations .",
    "for example , the permutation @xmath48 is not a rotation of the toy bloch sphere but a reflection through the plane perpendicular to the @xmath49 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : conj ] ) .",
    "thus , there are operations in the single toy bit model that have no quantum analogue .",
    "( we will see shortly that such toy operations correspond to _ anti - unitary _ quantum operations . )",
    "acts as a reflection on the toy sphere.,width=132 ]    the toy operations that do correspond to rotations on the bloch sphere are precisely the operations in @xmath30 , the group of even permutations . in terms of the linear model , these are the transformations of @xmath23 with determinant @xmath19 .",
    "toy operations not in @xmath30 may be expressed as a rotation composed with a single reflection .",
    "when @xmath50 is a rotation on the toy bloch sphere , its euler rotations @xmath51 satisfy @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "for example , the permutation @xmath24 corresponds to the rotation @xmath54 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : euler ] .",
    "stm  3 addresses the problem of measurement in the toy theory . for a single toy bit ,",
    "a measurement is any one question from a canonical set ; thus there are a total of six measurements that may be performed .",
    "after a measurement is performed and a result is obtained , the observer has acquired new information about the system and updates his state of knowledge to the result of the measurement .",
    "this ensures that a repeat of the question produces the same outcome .",
    "note that the outcome of a measurement is governed by the ontic state of the system and not the measurement itself .",
    "the question `` is the ontic state in @xmath55 ? ''",
    "can be represented by a vector @xmath56 . the probability of getting ",
    "as the outcome is then @xmath57 where @xmath12 is the current epistemic state of the system .",
    "after this outcome , the epistemic state is updated to be @xmath58 .",
    "the vectors @xmath59 and probabilities @xmath60 are analogous to the measurement operators and outcome probabilities in qm  3 .",
    "stm  4 concerns the composition of one or more toy bits . for the case of two toy bits",
    "there are four questions in a canonical set , two per bit , giving rise to 16 ontic states , which we denote @xmath61 . in the linear model",
    "this is simply the tensor product of the @xmath62-dimensional vector space with itself , and the ontic state @xmath63 is understood to be @xmath64 .",
    "the types of epistemic states arising in this case are of three types ; maximal , non maximal , and zero knowledge , corresponding to knowing the answers to two , one , or zero questions respectively .",
    "it suffices for our purposes to consider only states of maximal knowledge ( pure states ) . these , in spekkens representation , are of two types ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : twostates ] ) ,        called uncorrelated and correlated states respectively . an _ uncorrelated state _ is the tensor product of two pure single toy bit states .",
    "if each of the single toy bits satisfy the knowledge balance principle , then their composition will also satisfy the knowledge balance principle for the composite system .",
    "correlated state _ is one in which nothing is known about the ontic state of each elementary system , but everything is known about the classical correlations between the ontic states of the two elementary toy systems .",
    "if the two single bit systems in fig .  [ fig : twostates](b ) are labelled a and b , then nothing is known about the true state of either a or b , but we know that if a is in the state @xmath65 , then b is also in the state @xmath65 .    according to stm  2 ,",
    "operations on two toy bits are permutations of ontic states that map epistemic states to epistemic states .",
    "these permutations are of two types : tensor products of permutations on the individual systems , and indecomposable permutations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : perm ] ) .",
    "moreover , stm  4 suggests that if an operation is valid on a given system , then it should still be valid when an ancilla is added to that system .",
    "that is , if @xmath50 is a valid operation on a single toy bit , then @xmath66 ought to be valid on two toy bits .",
    "it follows that valid operations should compose under the tensor product .",
    "finally , stm  3 implies that a measurement of the two toy bit space is a partition of ontic states into disjoint epistemic states : each epistemic state consists of @xmath62 or @xmath67 ontic states .",
    "there are in total @xmath68 partitions of the two toy bit space into epistemic states of size @xmath62 .    in the linear model ,",
    "epistemic states , operations , and measurements extrapolate in the manner anticipated .",
    "a pure epistemic state is a @xmath69-vector of length @xmath70 containing exactly @xmath62 ones , whereas an operation is a @xmath71 permutation matrix .",
    "the group of operations can be computationally verified to be of order @xmath72 .",
    "measurement is a row vector @xmath73 with the state after measurement updated according to the outcome obtained . in the linear model",
    "stm  4 is understood as the composition of valid states and operations under the tensor product .",
    "finally , a two toy bit system can be geometrically realized by the four - dimensional cube ( see fig .  [ tesseract ] ) .",
    "this is a new representation for the two toy bit system that in some ways generalizes spekkens tetrahedral description of the single toy bit . by mapping the ontic states @xmath74 of an elementary system to the vertices @xmath75 of a square",
    ", the four - dimensional cube is the result of the tensor product of two elementary systems .",
    "every epistemic state is an affine plane containing four vertices , and the group of permutations of two toy bits is a subgroup of @xmath76 $ ] , the symmetry group of the four - dimensional cube ( for more details , see @xcite ) .        in this section we reviewed stm , identifying its axioms and drawing a correspondence with the axioms of quantum theory . in the next section ,",
    "we investigate a relaxation of stm  2 .",
    "in this section we relax stm  2 , the axiom describing valid reversible operations .",
    "we obtain a new group of operations which contains a subgroup isomorphic to the projective clifford group for two qubits , a characteristic of quantum theory not captured by stm .",
    "however , the operations in these new group fail to compose under the tensor product , rendering the relaxation of stm  2 physically unreasonable .",
    "nevertheless , we claim that operations that fail to compose under the tensor product can be used as tests for correlations in stm .",
    "recall that stm  2 describes valid operations on toy states .",
    "in particular , stm  2 requires that valid operations act on the ontic states in a reversible manner ( ontic determinism ) .",
    "now consider an empiricist living in a universe governed by the axioms of stm  a toy universe .",
    "such an empiricist has access only to epistemic states . as a result",
    "an empiricist sees determinism only at the epistemic scale ( epistemic determinism ) ; the knowledge balance principle forbids exact knowledge of the ontic state of the system . for an empiricist ,",
    "ontic determinism is too strict a condition .",
    "we thus propose the following amendment .",
    "stm  2@xmath77 : : :    a _ valid reversible operation _ is a linear transformation that    permutes the epistemic states of the system .    .",
    "the requirement that transformations be linear implies that as @xmath78 , then @xmath79 for any valid @xmath50 : in other words , mixtures of epistemic states are transformed into other mixtures .",
    "it follows that pairs of disjoint epistemic states are mapped to other pairs of disjoint states , and the amount of overlap between epistemic states is preserved .",
    "this linearity condition is essential if the toy theory is to emulate significant aspects of quantum theory .",
    "investigations into a non - linear theory of quantum mechanics  @xcite have been experimentally tested and found to be `` measurably not different from the linear formalism ''  @xcite .",
    "furthermore it was shown by peres that a non - linear quantum mechanical theory would violate the second law of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "we let @xmath80 denote the group of operations obtained by replacing stm  2 with stm  2@xmath77 . in terms of the linear model ,",
    "an operation is in @xmath80 if it can be represented as a @xmath27 orthogonal matrix that maps epistemic states to epistemic states .",
    "this includes all the operations in @xmath23 , but it also includes operations such as @xmath81    on the toy bloch sphere , @xmath80 is the subgroup of operations in @xmath47 that preserve the set of six pure epistemic states . on the toy bloch sphere , eq .  ,",
    "are the euler rotations @xmath82 respectively .",

    "[ fig : tswap ] . for convenience , we use the generating set @xmath154 for @xmath143",
    ". then the following map , extended to the entire group , is an isomorphism from @xmath155 to @xmath141 : @xmath156    a similar gap computation shows that spekkens group of operations for two toy bits is not isomorphic to @xmath157 , despite the fact that both groups have @xmath72 elements .",
    "one way to verify that the two groups are not isomorphic is the following : while the projective clifford group contains no maximal subgroups of order @xmath158 , spekkens group does .",
    "one such maximal subgroup is generated by the operations @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath152 ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tswap ] ) .",
    "as @xmath141 is isomorphic to the extended clifford group which contains the clifford group as a proper subgroup  the relaxation of stm  2 to stm  2@xmath77 results in a group of operations that is isomorphic to the clifford group of two qubits .",
    "we emphasize that this equivalence is a direct consequence of applying empiricism to stm .",
    "unfortunately , the relaxation of stm  2 to stm  2@xmath77 gives rise to a physically unreasonable state of affairs .",
    "for a physical model , we expect that if an operation is valid for a given system , then it should also be valid when we attach an ancilla to that system ; the operations of @xmath141 violate this condition .",
    "consider the operation @xmath161 : under stm  2@xmath77 , both @xmath84 and @xmath162 are valid operations on an elementary system , yet @xmath161 is not a valid operation on the composite system , as it fails to map the correlated state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twostates](b ) to a valid epistemic state .",
    "in fact , the subgroups of @xmath80 and @xmath141 that preserve valid epistemic states when an ancilla is added are simply spekkens original groups of operations for one and two toy bits respectively .",
    "however , just as positive maps serve as tests for entanglement in quantum theory , validity - preserving maps serve as tests of correlation in the toy theory , as we now explain .",
    "formally , let @xmath163 denote the set of operators acting on the hilbert space @xmath164 .",
    "then a linear map @xmath165 is _ positive _ if it maps positive operators in @xmath166 to positive operators in @xmath167 : in other words , @xmath168 implies @xmath169 . on the other hand @xmath170 is _ completely positive _ if the map @xmath171 is positive for every identity map @xmath172 . in other words ,",
    "a completely positive map takes valid density operators to valid density operators even if an ancilla is attached to the system .",
    "also recall that an operator @xmath173 is _ separable _ if it can be written in the form @xmath174 for @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and some probability distribution @xmath177 . a well known result in quantum information",
    "is that positive maps can distinguish whether or not a state is separable ( theorem 2  @xcite ) :    [ th : horodecki ] let @xmath178 act on @xmath179 .",
    "then @xmath178 is separable if and only if for any positive map @xmath180 , the operator @xmath181 is positive .",
    "theorem  [ th : horodecki ] says is that maps that are positive but not not completely positive serve as tests for detecting whether or not a density matrix is separable .",
    "an analogous statement can be made for validity preserving maps and correlated states in a two toy bit system .",
    "define a transformation @xmath170 in stm to be _ validity - preserving _ if it maps all valid epistemic states to valid epistemic states in a toy system ; all operations in @xmath80 and @xmath141 are validity - preserving .",
    "define @xmath170 to be _ completely validity - preserving _ if @xmath182 is validity - preserving for every @xmath162 , where @xmath162 is the identity transformation on some ancilla toy system .",
    "for example , @xmath183 is validity - preserving but not completely validity - preserving .",
    "finally , a two toy bit state is _ perfectly correlated _ if for any acquisition of knowledge about one of the systems , the description of the other system is refined .",
    "the perfectly correlated two toy bit states are precisely the correlated pure states : no mixed states are perfectly correlated .",
    "[ th : toyseparability ] let @xmath184 be a two toy bit epistemic state ( pure or mixed ) .",
    "then @xmath184 is perfectly correlated if and only if there exists a one toy bit validity - preserving operation @xmath185 such that @xmath186 is an invalid two toy bit state .",
    "first suppose @xmath184 is a pure state .",
    "if @xmath184 is uncorrelated , then it has the form @xmath187 , and for any @xmath188 , the state @xmath189 is a valid two toy bit state .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath184 is correlated , then it has the form @xmath190 , where @xmath191 is the correlated state shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twostates](b ) and @xmath138 is some permutation of the second toy bit system . in this case , the state @xmath192 is an invalid state , as we have already seen that @xmath193 is invalid .",
    "next suppose @xmath184 is a mixed state .",
    "then either @xmath184 is uncorrelated , in which case it has the form @xmath194 , @xmath195 , or @xmath196 , or it is correlated , in which case it has the form @xmath197 , with @xmath198 disjoint from @xmath199 and @xmath200 disjoint from @xmath201 .",
    "any of these mixed states may be written as a sum of pure uncorrelated states .",
    "since pure uncorrelated states remain valid under @xmath182 for any validity preserving @xmath170 , it follows that @xmath202 is also a valid state whenever @xmath184 is a mixed state .",
    "thus , invalidity of a state under a local validity - preserving map is a necessary and sufficient condition for a bipartite epistemic state ( pure or mixed ) to have perfect correlation .    in this section",
    "we introduced a possible relaxation of stm .",
    "motivated by empiricism , we argued for the relaxation of stm  2 , from ontic to epistemic determinism .",
    "we showed that this relaxation gives rise to a group of operations that is equivalent to the projective extended clifford group for one and two qubits .",
    "however , the operations of @xmath80 and @xmath141 are physically unreasonable as they do not represent completely validity - preserving maps .",
    "they do , however , serve as tests for correlations in the toy model . in the next section",
    "we discuss these results further .",
    "in this paper we formulated stm in an axiomatic framework and considered a possible relaxation ",
    "stm  2@xmath77in its assumptions .",
    "the motivation for proposing stm  2@xmath77 is the empirical fact that in a toy universe , an observer is restricted to knowledge of epistemic states .",
    "we discovered that replacing stm  2 with stm  2@xmath77 gave rise to a group of operations that exhibit an isomorphism with the projective extended clifford group of operations ( and consequently the projective clifford group of operations ) in quantum mechanics .",
    "this characteristic is not present in stm ; while @xmath23 is isomorphic to @xmath203 , the group of operations for two toy bits in stm is not isomorphic to @xmath157 .",
    "however , due to the fact that operations arising from stm  2@xmath77 do not compose under the tensor product  they are not completely validity - preserving  the proposed relaxation does not give rise to a physically reasonable model .    despite this failure , the group of operations generated by stm  2@xmath77 gives rise to a very useful tool ; namely , the horodecki criterion for separability in the toy model .",
    "the same operations that render the toy model physically unreasonable serve as tools for detecting correlations in the toy model .",
    "we believe that the investigation into possible relaxations of the axioms of stm gives rise demonstrates the power as well as the limitations of stm .",
    "most significantly , we discover that no physically reasonable toy model can arise from relaxing stm  2 to an epistemic perspective ; this robustness is an indication of the model s power . on the other hand , we conclude that there is at least one characteristic of quantum theory that the stm can not capture , an equivalence with the clifford group of operations .",
    "the authors would like to thank rob spekkens for his helpful discussion of the two toy bit system , nathan babcock , gilad gour , and an anonymous referee for insightful comments and suggestions .",
