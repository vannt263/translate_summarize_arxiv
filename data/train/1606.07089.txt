    "<S> highly disordered superconductors , in the magnetic - field - driven insulating state , can show discontinuous current - voltage characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> electron overheating has been shown to give a consistent description of this behavior , but there are other , more exotic , explanations including a novel , `` superinsulating '' state and a many - body localized state </S>",
    "<S> . we present ac - dc crossed - measurements , in which the application of a dc voltage is applied along our sample , while a small ac voltage is applied in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> we varied the dc voltage and observed a simultaneous discontinuity in both ac and dc currents . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the inferred electron - temperature in the transverse measurement matches that in the longitudinal one , strongly supporting electron overheating as the source of observed current - voltage characteristics . </S>",
    "<S> our measurement technique may be applicable as a method of probing electron overheating in many other physical systems , which show discontinuous or non - linear current - voltage characteristics .    </S>",
    "<S> highly disordered superconductors can undergo a transition to an insulating state . </S>",
    "<S> this superconductor to insulator transition ( sit ) can be driven by several parameters such as disorder strength , thickness or magnetic field ( @xmath0)@xcite . while studying the @xmath0-driven insulating state in amorphous indium oxide ( a : ino ) thin films , sambandamurthy et al . </S>",
    "<S> discovered that , at low temperature ( @xmath1 ) , discontinuities appear in the current - voltage characteristics ( @xmath2)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar findings were later seen in disordered titanium nitride thin films@xcite , where they have been interpreted as evidence for a novel insulating state , termed a superinsulator@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> more recently , altshuler et al.@xcite argued that the discontinuous @xmath2 can be accounted for by electron overheating . </S>",
    "<S> their theory is based on the assumptions that the electrons interact weakly with the phonons but strongly with each other , thus leading to the possibility that they will have their own , well defined @xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) , which can be very different from that of the phonons ( @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , they assumed that ohm s law holds for the entire voltage ( @xmath5 ) range of the measurements , i.e. @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the current and @xmath8 is the resistance . in a steady state , they could obtain @xmath3 from a heat - balance eq : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the sample volume , @xmath11 is the electron - phonon coupling coefficient@xcite and @xmath12 is a material - dependent constant .    </S>",
    "<S> by numerically solving eq.[e1 ] for the experimentally relevant parameters , altshuler et al.@xcite found that , below a certain @xmath4 , @xmath13 develops a bi - stable region , i.e. , for a certain range of @xmath5 eq.[e1 ] can have two stable solutions : a low @xmath3 solution , in which @xmath14 , resulting in high @xmath8 , and a high @xmath3 solution , in which @xmath3 can be much higher than @xmath4 , with much lower @xmath8 . at equilibrium , ( @xmath15 ) the system is in the low @xmath3 solution . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath5 is increased above a threshold value , the system enters the bi - stable region where it can spontaneously jump to the high @xmath3 solution , resulting in a discontinuous jump in @xmath7 . alongside ref.@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> ovadia et al . </S>",
    "<S> conducted a detailed experimental study of the @xmath2 , showing that they are consistent with the overheated electron framework@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> if this framework properly describes the physics behind observed @xmath2 , an interesting scenario emerges . at low @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> the application of a @xmath5 can result in an analogue of the liquid to gas phase transition , but under non - equilibrium conditions@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic system can be driven far from equilibrium , offering an experimental tool to study the nature of quantum systems under such conditions .    despite the consistency shown by the experimental results of ovadia et al . </S>",
    "<S> , a direct demonstration that electron overheating is behind the reported @xmath2 via a direct measurement of @xmath3 , is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstration is essential because there are other theoretical approaches that offer a distinctly different view of the discontinuous @xmath2 in our , and in others , systems@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one such theory is that the low @xmath7 branch of the experimental @xmath2 is evidence of a `` superinsulating '' state which is destroyed at a critical @xmath5@xcite , dual to the critical @xmath7 in a superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> another competing theory is that the observed @xmath2 are a manifestation of a novel many - body localized state , as explained in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a third possible explanation is that application of an electric field ( @xmath16 ) tilts the random potential created by disorder until , at a threshold @xmath16 value , a conduction channel connecting the two ends of the sample forms . </S>",
    "<S> this model was treated in ref.@xcite in the context of metallic islands in a disordered potential . </S>",
    "<S> it was used in order to explain discontinuous and non - linear @xmath2 observed in various systems@xcite , including insulating films@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we considered electronic noise measurements as a possible method to directly measure @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements , an obvious option because equilibrium noise is a commonly used thermometer , proved unfeasible . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of low @xmath3 ( @xmath17 mk ) , high @xmath8 ( typically @xmath18 ) and the need to flow a dc @xmath7 while conducting the measurement , is yet too challenging experimentally .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we have taken a different approach : according to ref.@xcite , @xmath8 is determined by @xmath3 that , in turn , is determined by the power input into the system via joule heating . under the assumption that joule heating is uniform , @xmath3 is also expected to be uniform throughout the system . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 , as inferred by a measurement of @xmath8 in a given orientation , should be the same regardless of the direction in which @xmath5 is applied . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of our method was to sweep @xmath5 and infer @xmath3 from two independent measurements of @xmath8 , one in the direction parallel to @xmath5 and another in a perpendicular direction .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that our method can not directly distinguish between the scenario described above , where @xmath3 differs from @xmath4 , which in turn remains equal to the @xmath1 of the external bath ( @xmath19 ) , and a scenario where the entire sample decouples from the external bath , i.e. @xmath20 . in order to distinguish between these two scenarios we conducted a test experiment , </S>",
    "<S> whose details we describe in the supplementary materials section of this paper , which clearly indicates that the first scenario is the relevant one in our system .    </S>",
    "<S> [ t ] * our experimental setup*. * a*. shows the setup we used to measure @xmath21 ( for more information see supplementary ) . the electronic circuit shown schematically </S>",
    "<S> was comprised of two trans - impedance amplifiers , a lock - in amplifier , a dc @xmath5-source and two @xmath22f capacitors used as dc - blocks . </S>",

    "<S> [ iv , rv , rt],title=\"fig : \" ]    the results presented in this work were obtained from a @xmath33 long , @xmath34 wide , 10 contact hall - bar sample of @xmath35 thick a : ino ( see fig.[setup]).the critical @xmath0 ( @xmath36 ) at which our sample showed a sit was @xmath37 t. a dc @xmath5 was applied in the longitudinal ( x ) direction while a small , @xmath38 ac , @xmath5 was applied in the transverse ( y ) direction ( see supplementary information for more details ) . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal @xmath5 ( @xmath26 ) was swept from @xmath39 to @xmath40 mv , while the transverse @xmath5 ( @xmath41 ) was held constant . during this , the longitudinal dc @xmath7 ( @xmath42 ) and the transverse ac @xmath7 ( @xmath25 ) were measured .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath42 and @xmath25 vs @xmath26 are shown in fig.[iv , rv , rt]a . at low @xmath26 </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath42 and @xmath25 are within the noise . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath26 is increased , at @xmath43 mv , @xmath42 and @xmath25 each attain a value that appears abruptly , well above the noise , and grows progressively as @xmath26 is increased further . upon reducing @xmath26 ( going from @xmath39 to @xmath44 mv ) , @xmath42 and </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 decrease gradually , until rapidly dropping at @xmath45 .    following the assumptions stated above </S>",
    "<S> , we calculated the longitudinal and transverse @xmath46 ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) by applying ohm s law : @xmath47 . in fig.[iv , </S>",
    "<S> rv , rt]b , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are plotted against @xmath26 , showing the same abrupt escape from the noise as seen for the @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum @xmath8 that we could measure , given our noise level in this setup , was @xmath49 @xmath10 .    in order to infer a value of @xmath3 from each of the data points </S>",
    "<S> , we used the zero - bias @xmath50 of the sample(@xmath51 ) , where @xmath1 refers to the cryostat temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we conducted a two - terminal measurement of @xmath51 , while sweeping @xmath1 slowly ( in order to ensure @xmath52 ) . at </S>",
    "<S> low @xmath5 the @xmath2 were linear , as was verified by @xmath53 measurements ( see supplementary ) , indicating that @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> thus by measuring in the linear range we ensured @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> we measured @xmath51 in two different setups . </S>",
    "<S> the first was the setup , shown in fig.[setup]b , which we used to measure @xmath56 , and the second was the ac - equivalent of our experimental setup , shown in fig.[setup]c , which we used to measure @xmath57 . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we used an ac @xmath5 of @xmath38 which is well within the linear @xmath53 range . @xmath58 and @xmath59 vs @xmath1 are shown in fig.[iv , rv , rt]b .    </S>",
    "<S> we inverted @xmath60 , attained @xmath61 and inferred a @xmath3 value from each data point of @xmath62 . in fig.[tel_v_example ] we plotted @xmath63 and @xmath64 vs @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental error in @xmath65 allowed us to measure @xmath3 down to @xmath66 mk . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement between @xmath63 and @xmath64 is near - perfect .    </S>",
    "<S> we next turned our focus to a @xmath0-dependent study of the @xmath2 using our new technique . </S>",
    "<S> we defined @xmath67 . in fig.[deltel ] we plotted @xmath68 vs @xmath63 for various @xmath69 ranging from 0.0382 up to 12 t. for sake of clarity we only displayed a portion of the @xmath69 that were studied , which represents the trend observed for all @xmath69 examined . for @xmath70 t , </S>",
    "<S> all measured @xmath63 were within @xmath71 of @xmath64 i.e. below the dashed line in fig.[deltel ] . for @xmath72 t , </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath0 approached @xmath36 , @xmath63 became systematically larger than @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> both noise and systematic error in @xmath73 grew significantly as @xmath0 approached @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to @xmath74 becoming a progressively slow - varying function of @xmath3 , thus inverting it caused large uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our measurements point to a possible deviation from the overheated electron picture as @xmath36 is approached .    </S>",
