    "in a recent series of papers we have considered the evolution of low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) , and in particular the question of which lmxbs should be transient according to the disk instability model . to have low enough mass transfer rates for transient behavior , short  period ( @xmath1  d )",
    "neutron star systems require special formation conditions ( king , kolb & burderi 1996 , hereafter kkb ) .",
    "these formation conditions can indeed be shown to hold in a significant fraction of neutron ",
    "star systems ( king & kolb 1997 ) .",
    "by contrast almost all short  period black  hole systems will be transient ( king , kolb & szuszkiewicz 1997 , hereafter kks ) .",
    "period lmxbs whose evolution is driven by the nuclear expansion of an evolved low ",
    "mass companion with a degenerate helium core are almost always transient , regardless of whether they contain a black hole or a neutron star ( kks and king et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the recently discovered soft x  ray transient gro  j165540 ( orosz & bailyn 1997 ) belongs to none of these classes .",
    "the companion orbits a @xmath2 black hole with a period of 2.62 days , and has a rather large mass ( @xmath0 ) , too high for the simple core  envelope picture used by kks , king et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to hold .",
    "its spectral type ( f3f6 ; effective temperature @xmath3  k ) actually implies a star in the process of crossing the hertzsprung gap . since here",
    "the stellar radius @xmath4 expands significantly on the star s thermal time @xmath5  yr , one would expect mass transfer rates @xmath6  @xmath7  yr@xmath8 , which are too high for disk instabilities to occur , particularly when one allows for irradiation of the disk by the central accreting source ( van paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "nevertheless gro  j165540 clearly shows transient behavior , though in a rather complex form : the batse detectors aboard the compton gro observed distinct hard x  ray outbursts in july 1994 ( when the source was discovered ) , as well as september 1994 , november 1994 , march 1995 and july 1995 ( harmon et al .",
    "1995 , tavani et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the 1994 outbursts were associated with radio flaring and apparent superluminal motion of radio plasmoids ( hjellming & rupen 1995 ) , giving the system distance as @xmath9  kpc . after a phase of true x  ray quiescence a soft x ",
    "ray outburst was observed by rxte in april 1996 ( levine et al .",
    "1996 ) , again accompanied by brightening in other wavebands .",
    "accordingly we consider the evolution of gro  j165540 in detail here .",
    "we apply results of computations of lmxbs with donors crossing the hertzsprung gap , details of which will be presented elsewhere ( kolb 1997 ) .",
    "we shall see that a short transient phase is indeed possible , although the observed parameters of gro  j165540 place it slightly outside our currently computed instability strip .",
    "uncertainties in the input stellar physics and perhaps in the observationally determined value for the effective temperature probably allow the source to lie within the strip . since the instability strip is narrow",
    ", we consider the consequences of the high implied space density of systems like gro  j165540 .",
    "a star crossing the hertzsprung gap has finished core hydrogen burning , but not yet ignited core helium burning .",
    "mass transfer from such a donor is known as case b. this case is well studied ( e.g. kippenhahn et al.1967 , pylyser & savonije 1988 , kolb & ritter 1990 , de  greve 1993 ) , particularly in the context of algol evolution .",
    "the main difference for black hole lmxbs is that the donor is the less massive star .",
    "elsewhere we shall present extensive computations of this case ( kolb 1997 ) , in which we distinguish transient from persistent lmxbs by comparing the mass transfer rate @xmath10 with the critical rate @xmath11 at which hydrogen is just ionized at the outer disk edge .",
    "a system is transient if @xmath12 .",
    "we can summarize these results as follows .",
    "figure  1 gives the evolutionary tracks of the donor stars of selected sequences on an hr diagram with parameters chosen to lie close to gro  j165540 .",
    "the positions of single stars of fixed mass are also shown . at any time",
    "the luminosity and effective temperature of the donor is roughly the same as that of a single star of the same mass and radius .",
    "this explains why orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) found parameters for the secondary in gro  j165540 which are ` consistent with a @xmath13 single star evolution ' .",
    "however , the donor stars are not in thermal equilibrium , and their evolution through any point on the figure depends on their previous history .",
    "in particular for much of the time the mass transfer rates for the binaries are of order @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the thermal timescale of the donor ( of order the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz time ) at the start of mass transfer , and thus depend strongly on the mass @xmath16 of the donor at that initial time .",
    "the portions of the tracks in thick linestyle show where the systems are transient according to the criterion of kks . as can be seen , in addition to the expected transient phase",
    "when the donors are close to the low  mass giant branch , there is a short transient phase when the star is still in the hertzsprung gap .",
    "this phase occurs because the stellar radius expands very little ( or even contracts ) at this point ; this in turn is a result of the complex structural change brought about by the switch from thick to thin shell h  burning .",
    "the radius slowdown always occurs at the same effective temperature as for a single star with the donor s initial mass , but at roughly the same radius as for a single star with the donor s actual mass",
    ".    these findings can be conveniently generalized to arbitrary @xmath16 in a plot of orbital period versus donor mass ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "conservative evolution with constant binary mass @xmath17 is towards longer @xmath18 and smaller @xmath19 along the curves @xmath20  const , while along an evolution with mass loss @xmath21 is larger ( see the tracks shown in the figure ) .",
    "the hatching on the figure relates to the transient / persistent nature of the systems : in the unhatched region all black  hole systems are persistent , and in the narrow hatched strip bisecting this zone all the systems are transient .",
    "this is the phase where the radius expansion slows . because this only depends on the current stellar mass",
    ", it is insensitive to the initial mass @xmath16 , unlike most other properties of the evolutionary sequences .",
    "most systems in the large hatched region are also transient ( this is the phase where the donor becomes a low  mass giant ) , although systems evolving into this region from the unhatched ` transient exclusion zone ' ( thus with large initial donor mass ) remain persistent until @xmath19 has dropped somewhat",
    ". the transient strip terminates at @xmath22 , as for more massive donors @xmath23 even when the radius expansion slows .",
    "taken at face value , the system parameters of gro  j165540 as derived by orosz & bailyn ( 1997 ) place it in a region of the @xmath24 plane where it should be persistent rather than transient , with a mass transfer rate close to the eddington limit ( if the initial donor mass was @xmath25 ) or super  eddington ( if @xmath26 ) . in this case the observed outbursts and variability must presumably be caused by instabilities in the accretion flow at eddington- or super  eddington mass transfer rates .",
    "small variations in the accretion rate could have a significant effect on the appearance of the source by changing its effective photosphere .",
    "however , gro  j165540 is classified as a transient , and indeed , the x  ray outbursts show characteristic features consistent with the operation of an underlying disk instability .",
    "simple scalings for the outburst duty cycle and recurrence time of soft x ",
    "ray transients , taking into account the effect of irradiation on the outburst ( king & ritter 1997 ) , suggest an irregular outburst pattern in long  period systems like gro  j165540 : a series of outbursts with short recurrence time ( the presently observed behavior ) may alternate with a much longer quiescence ( the behavior before the first detection in 1994 ) .",
    "the delay between the optical and x  ray outburst observed in april 1996 ( orosz et al .",
    "1997 ) is in close analogy to the uv delay observed in dwarf novae . in terms of the disk instability model",
    "such delays occur naturally whenever the disk does not extend all the way to the white dwarf surface , or the innermost stable orbit in the case of a black hole accretor ( e.g. livio & pringle 1992 , king 1997 ) .",
    "hameury et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest the presence of a `` hole '' in the disk of gro  j165540 by postulating that the disk flow gives way to advection at some inner radius .    in the light of this evidence",
    "it is intriguing that the observed system parameters put gro  j165540 quite close to the short transient phase that similar systems encounter when the secondary evolves through the hertzsprung gap .",
    "if we assume that gro  j165540 in reality actually falls into the narrow transient strip , its outburst behavior is consistent with the disk instability model for soft x ",
    "ray transients .",
    "this would require some error in the position of the transient strip or of the system .",
    "the precise location of the transient strip in the hr diagram is determined by the effective temperature where single stars in the mass range @xmath27 temporarily slow or reverse their expansion from the main sequence to the first giant branch .",
    "this effective temperature ( and hence the radius and luminosity ) depends on details of the input physics of the evolution code , particularly opacities and the treatment of convection .",
    "in addition , it is conceivable that the observational determination of @xmath28 might yet change .",
    "a value @xmath29  k would place gro  j165540 in the predicted transient strip . in orosz & bailyn s spectral classification procedure the corresponding spectral type g2iv achieves a minimum r.m.s .",
    "value which is only @xmath30 larger than that of the best  fit type f4iv .",
    "roche geometry implies with @xmath31  k a secondary luminosity @xmath32 .",
    "this would require a color excess @xmath33 ( rather than 1.3 ) for consistency with the observed mean v magnitude ( 17.12 mag ) and distance ( 3.2  kpc ) .",
    "a further uncertainty may arise from the fact that the accretion disk still contributes @xmath34 of the v flux during the extended x  ray quiescence in 1996 , and as much as @xmath35 in 1995 ( orosz & bailyn 1997 ) .",
    "although this transient phase is very short ( @xmath36  myr if @xmath37 ) , it is quite plausible that such a system would nevertheless be observable , because its outbursts would be extremely luminous .",
    "the actual transfer rate in the transient phase depends on the initial orbital separation .",
    "the closer the initial separation was to the present value , the lower the transfer rate . with a typical transient duty cycle @xmath38",
    "the instantaneous accretion rate can be as high as @xmath39  @xmath7  yr@xmath8 , implying luminosities up to @xmath40  erg  s@xmath8 .",
    "this is consistent with the outburst x  ray luminosity @xmath41  erg  s@xmath8 inferred for gro  j165540 from observations ( e.g.  tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",
    "x  ray luminosities of anything approaching this order are visible throughout the galaxy , as observations of high  mass x ",
    "ray binaries show .",
    "however , just as for those systems , the price one pays for asserting the visibility of a short  lived evolutionary phase is the requirement of a very high birth rate .",
    "here we would need a rate of order 1 per @xmath42 yr .",
    "the giant branch transient phase is @xmath43 times longer than the hertzsprung gap transient phase .",
    "the detection probability of the correspondingly higher number of giant branch transients with intermediate ",
    "mass donors may nevertheless be comparable to that of the hertzsprung gap transients as the duty cycle decreases with increasing orbital period ( king & ritter 1997 ) .",
    "a more serious problem is that the required high formation rate implies about @xmath44 bright persistent accreting sources in the hertzsprung gap , in apparent conflict with observation . in the next section",
    "we examine possible resolutions of this disagreement .",
    "the disk instability picture provides a very clean separation of lmxbs into transient and persistent sources , provided that one takes due account of the effects of irradiation by the central accretor ( van paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "this is strong circumstantial evidence in its favor .",
    "accordingly one would be very reluctant to abandon it simply because the application of this picture to the transient source gro  j165540 leads to an apparent overpopulation of bright accreting sources in the galaxy .",
    "the resolution of this conflict is probably related to the fact that most systems populating the @xmath45 plane in fig .",
    "2 are extremely luminous .",
    "the persistent sources with @xmath46 would be close to the eddington limit for a @xmath2 black hole ( and super ",
    "eddington if @xmath47 ) , while with typical duty cycles , the outbursts of the transient systems could be still brighter .",
    "this raises the possibility of significant mass loss , in two forms .",
    "gro  j165540 and another system , grs  1915 + 105 , are seen to lose mass in relativistic jets ( hjellming & rupen 1995 , mirabel & rodrguez 1994 ) , although there is no consensus on the actual amount of mass lost .",
    "further , it is theoretically possible ( e.g. begelman , mckee & shields 1983 , czerny & king 1989 ) for most of the transferred mass to be lost from the outer parts of the accretion disk , driven by the luminosity of the accreting fraction .",
    "there is indirect evidence that much of the mass transferred in neutron ",
    "star lmxbs is lost , since the remnant pulsars always have rather modest masses ( see king & kolb 1997 for a discussion ) .",
    "this mass loss may prevent the bright systems appearing as x  ray sources , either because much of the mass never accretes to the compact primary , or because the mass loss itself shrouds the system and degrades the x  rays .",
    "alternatively , the accretion rates may be too high for x  ray production .",
    "the effective photosphere for the accretion flow may actually radiate at much longer wavelengths for most of the time .",
    "since most of these sources are probably rather distant and heavily reddened , the infrared is the most likely place to detect them . if gro  j165540 is indeed a genuine soft x ",
    "ray transient in the hertzsprung gap , then either of these possibilities would reconcile theory and observation .    in this connection it is interesting that grs  1915 + 105 , also classified as a soft x ",
    "ray transient , has been persistently bright in x",
    " rays since 1992 . at its minimum x  ray luminosity @xmath48  erg  s@xmath8 ( e.g. belloni et al .",
    "1997 ) this is far longer than can be explained by a disk instability .",
    "it may be that this source , too , is actually one of the ` persistent ' sources predicted by fig .  2 .",
    "certainly its current mass accretion rate @xmath49  @xmath7  yr@xmath8 is consistent with that expected , although the heavy interstellar reddening makes the nature of the companion very uncertain ( mirabel et al .",
    "the current ( post1992 ) state may correspond to a _ lower _ accretion rate , so that the x  rays become temporarily visible ( see also belloni et al .",
    "infrared monitoring of this source should provide more information about this possibility , in that the x ",
    "rays and infrared should be anticorrelated .",
