    "our experiment starts with a cold gas of @xmath102sr atoms that are confined in an optical dipole trap .",
    "the trap is formed by two crossed @xmath123 nm laser beams with waists of 300 @xmath46 m and 440 @xmath46 m in the horizontal direction and 65 @xmath46 m and 38 @xmath46 m in the vertical direction .",
    "the trapping beams cross at an angle of @xmath124 in the horizontal plane to form a pancake shaped trap that confines several million atoms at a temperature of @xmath125nk , which we further reduce to about @xmath126nk by evaporative cooling .",
    "a magnetic field of @xmath127 g is applied along the vertical direction and defines the quantization axis .",
    "the @xmath104 nm light propagates vertically upwards with a circular polarization to drive the @xmath128 transition .",
    "we have measured the corresponding rabi frequency from rabi oscillation in the absence of the rydberg coupling laser .",
    "our uv - laser propagates horizontally and is linearly polarised in the vertical direction to drive the @xmath129 transition .",
    "the spatial widths of the excitation beams are both much larger than the size of our cold atom cloud , such that spatial intensity variations can be neglected under the conditions of our experiments .",
    "the loss spectra are recorded by turning off the trapping light after rydberg excitation and measuring the remaining number of ground state atoms via absorption imaging on the @xmath130 at a wavelength of @xmath131 nm .",
    "all spectra are taken with the trap on . the trapping laser ( 1064 nm )",
    "is not a magic wavelength for either the @xmath132@xmath133 transition or the @xmath133@xmath134 transition . in principle",
    ", this may lead to shifts of the resonant frequencies and a broadenenig of lines due to inhomogeneous sampling . for two reasons ,",
    "however , these effects are negligible in our experiment .",
    "first , we simply take the shifted line positions as our redefined zero - detuning positions . for example , we find the uv resonance in the trap by finding the uv laser frequency that produces symmetric autler - townes spectra at very low density and very low rabi frequency for the 689 nm laser .",
    "second , the effect of line broadening is small because the spectra are taken in such a low - intensity trap .",
    "the optical trap depth has been reduced to about 1@xmath46k in order to produce a 150nk sample . for the @xmath132@xmath133 transition ,",
    "the relevant polarizabilities are known , and the broadening of the transition is below 10khz .",
    "the polarizability of the rydberg level has not been measured , but in this optical dipole trap configuration , we observe @xmath135350khz wide lines for off - resonant , two - photon excitation to the rydberg state , which is consistent with our expected uv laser linewidth as determined by the servo - lock error signal . this is narrower than the @xmath135500khz linewidth of the non - interacting autler - townes spectra ( first panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "so we conclude that the broadening of lines due to ac stark shift is not a significant contribution to the lineshape .",
    "below , we provide further details on the more complex structure of the interaction potential at short interatomic distances , and show that its effects are fundamentally different in the present resonant dressing approach compared to the previously proposed off - resonant two - level scheme .        while the van der waals potential assumed in the main text provides an excellent description of the atomic interaction at large distances , the situation becomes more involved at shorter distances where the strong dipole - dipole interaction may shift further pair - states close to resonance .",
    "one can calculate such potentials by diagonalising the dipole - dipole interaction operator using a large basis of relevant pair states @xcite .",
    "this yields a set of potential curves @xmath136 corresponding to a given molecular eigenstate @xmath137 . while there are generally many of such potential curves in the relevant energy region , only a few of them have a finite optical coupling strength @xmath138 to the single excited pair states @xmath139 and @xmath140 . to illustrate their effect on the performance of rydberg - dressing we only include one of them [ blue curve in figs .",
    "[ fig : s1](a ) and ( d ) ] for the specific example of @xmath141-states of rubidium atoms .    for off - resonant two - level rydberg - dressing",
    "such additional potential curves have a strong effect on the coherence of the system . when @xmath142 the doubly excited pair state @xmath137 becomes resonant with the two - atom ground state @xmath143",
    "[ see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : s1](b ) ] .",
    "the resulting avoided crossing of the rydberg dressed ground state potential and the ground state - dressed excited state @xcite then gives rise to a drastic increase of the excited rydberg state fraction and consequently a dramatic drop of the effective life time as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1](c ) . in a gas",
    "this can lead to dissipative atomic collisions and increased atom losses in the system .    for our resonant rydberg - dressing approach",
    "the situation is dramatically different . in this case , the resonances with other molecular pair states occur when @xmath144 .",
    "however , such a resonant coupling to a doubly excited state is expected to restore eit conditions and thereby enhance the coherence time rather than decreasing it . to address this question we numerically solve for the steady state of the driven two - atom system , now accounting for the distance dependent rabi frequency @xmath138 and including one additional potential curve as described above .",
    "[ fig : s1](f ) demonstrates that the coherence time is indeed enhanced by the additional pair - state resonance and remains otherwise unaffected . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1](e ) , this coherence time enhancement is accompanied by a sharp drop of the effective interaction potential at the resonant position .",
    "this behaviour is precisely what one would expect from the reestablishment of a two - atom dark state around the pair state resonance .",
    "generally , the resulting potential dip is very narrow and should not affect the dynamics of colliding atom pairs compared to the approximate case without the additional potential curves [ gray lines in fig .",

    "<S> [ @xmath97khz ] clearly outperforms the two - level approach and yields sizeable effective interactions of several khz , exceeding the scattering rate @xmath98 by up to 2 orders of magnitude . on the contrary , for alkaline atoms , such as rubidium , both approaches turn out to be rather inefficient due to the large decay rate @xmath99mhz of the intermediate state , requiring very large @xmath9 in order to realize significant effective interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we note that larger interactions can still be obtained from direct single - photon transitions to rydberg @xmath100 states . </S>",
    "<S> however , the strong anisotropy of van der waals interactions between non - zero angular momentum states @xcite can lead to pair resonances @xcite that cause large losses and render @xmath100-state dressing inapplicable in three dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> an important feature of our eit - based approach is that the detrimental effects of such resonances , which can also occur at small distances @xcite are completely removed . instead of enhancing the excited rydberg fraction </S>",

    "<S> the observed atom loss predominantly stems from rydberg state decay causing photon recoil and transitions to dark intermediate triplet states . </S>",

    "<S> in conclusion , we have developed an approach to generate finite - range atomic interactions via two - photon resonant optical coupling to rydberg states . </S>",
    "<S> this system entails interesting physics , such as an interaction - induced two - body resonance that leads to enhanced effective interactions while preserving long coherence times . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the possibility to engineer atomic interactions under rydberg - eit conditions @xcite opens up new perspectives , e.g.  concerning the coupled nonlinear dynamics of light @xcite and matter wave fields , which mutually induce effective interactions for either component based on the mechanism discussed in this work . the enhanced interactions together with the demonstrated immunity to short - distance pair resonances holds promise for studying finite - range interactions in quantum gases . </S>",
