    "the known protocols in quantum information processing require a certain degree of quantum - mechanical entanglement to achieve an advantage over their classical counterparts .",
    "often , this quantum - mechanical `` essence '' is provided in terms of in - advance - prepared quantum states .",
    "for example , bell states are used in a well - known protocol for quantum cryptography @xcite , and schemes for multiparty cryptographic tasks using greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states and other calderbank - shor - steane ( css ) states have been devised @xcite .",
    "further , in quantum computation , multiparticle entangled states can be used to streamline the execution of gates and subcircuits via gate teleportation @xcite , and cluster states represent a universal resource for quantum computation by local measurements @xcite .    in most realistic scenarios the quality of entangled resource states is degraded by the effects of decoherence and methods of error detection or correction are required to counteract this process .",
    "one such method is state purification where a ( close to ) perfect copy of a quantum state is distilled out of many imperfect ones .",
    "purification was first described for bell states @xcite and subsequently generalized to bicolorable graph states and css states @xcite .",
    "recently , a protocol for the purification of @xmath0 states was presented in @xcite .",
    "state purification is used , for example , to establish a perfect quantum channel between two parties @xcite , to efficiently create long - range entanglement via quantum repeaters @xcite or to render certain schemes for topological fault - tolerant quantum computation universal @xcite .",
    "imperfect initial states are not the only sources of error for realistic state purification . with the exception of certain schemes of topological quantum computation such as @xcite , errors in the gates for purification also need to be taken into account .",
    "what can we expect to gain from an imperfect purification procedure ?",
    "in the process of purification the errors of the initial state are replaced by the errors of the purifying gates .",
    "thus , the amount of error may be reduced if the quality of the initial states is low compared to the quality of the gates for purification ( but above threshold ) .",
    "further , purification can be used to _ condition _ the error of a quantum state .",
    "for example , imperfect bell - state purification can be used to establish a perfectly private if imperfect quantum channel @xcite . in a multiparty scenario , for some protocols",
    "the purification gates act locally on each copy of the state to purify , resulting in a local or close to local error model for the final state .",
    "this feature attains relevance in the context of fault - tolerant quantum computation .",
    "threshold theorems have been established for increasingly general types of error including coherent and long - range errors @xcite but there are realistic scenarios in which standard error correction appears to fail @xcite .",
    "in such a situation , state purification may be used to turn the error model into a more benign one .",
    "the focus of this paper is purification of bicolorable graph states by imperfect means , a subject that has previously been studied in @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the interplay between threshold and overhead . specifically , we seek protocols that , ( i ) work with erroneous purification gates , ( ii ) have a high threshold and good quality of the output state , ( iii ) scale efficiently , and ( iv ) are analytically tractable .",
    "hashing @xcite protocols have a high threshold in the error of the initial state and require only a minimal resource overhead , but they break down as soon as the purification gates become slightly imperfect .",
    "copies are included from the beginning .",
    "each qubit of the state copies which are later measured is acted upon by a large number of noisy cnot - gates .",
    "the error - correction procedure is applied only after the cnots have acted , such that their errors accumulate .",
    "thus in the large @xmath1 limit no matter how small the gate noise , the output state will be severely affected and the protocol will fail . ]",
    "recursive protocols such as @xcite also have a high threshold for error in the initial states and furthermore work with imperfect purification gates , but they are exponentially inefficient in the number of particles .",
    "our protocols are resistant to initial as well as purification errors and are computationally efficient . as a bonus , our protocols are analytically tractable for a wide class of errors .",
    "specifically , our base protocol described in sec .",
    "[ sec:3copy ] can be analyzed for arbitrary input states and general probabilistic pauli errors in the purification gates .",
    "this fact arises through a special locality property .",
    "so far , the exponential increase of parameters in the description of @xmath2-particle mixed states  even mixed stabilizer states  has been found to be an obstacle to analytic discussion , and only severely restricted error models have been treated in the literature .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : post - selection ] we briefly review the protocol @xcite for purification of bicolorable graph states . in secs .",
    "[ sec:3copy ] and [ sec : conditional - bandaid ] we describe our purification protocols and characterize them in terms of purification threshold , output quality , and overhead .",

    "[ fig : mcnot ] .",
    "relabeling states in the graph basis to reflect the partition into colors @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) , the effect of the mcnot is @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 is elementwise addition modulo 2 .",
    "notice that information about @xmath22 has been copied into state 2 and information about @xmath23 has been copied into state 1 .",
    "we then measure the local observables @xmath11 and @xmath13 on copy 2 , and reconstruct from the measurement outcomes the eigenvalues of all @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",

    "we correct , to lowest order , errors in the qubits of color @xmath7 . in the next round we interchange the roles of colors @xmath7 and @xmath8 and",
    "so purify the @xmath8 qubits .",
    "we can concatenate this procedure to achieve desired levels of purity . because we are post - selecting states on the basis of a global measurement outcome , this protocol is inefficient for large states .",
    "this inefficiency can be addressed by using error correction instead of post - selection , to which we now turn .",
    "the simplest way to get enough information to perform error correction is to do the mcnot on three copies instead of two .",

    "this implies that such correlations are absent in all purified states which end up at the same fixed point as the perfect state .",
