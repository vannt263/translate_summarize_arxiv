    "higher - dimensional theories are one of the most old and interesting unification theories considered by physicist and mathematicians unifying gravitation with yang - mills interactions .",
    "the history of these theories began with theodore kaluza and oscar klein , when they formulated a five - dimensional theory unifying gravitation and electromagnetism , but this theory used a great amount of hypothesis on the structure of space - time and on the functional dependence of physical quantities .",
    "the first real geometrical formulation of these theories was given by kerner @xcite and cho @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they formulated the theory as a principal fiber bundle , being the four - dimensional space - time the basis space of the bundle , and the gauge group of the yang - mills fields they wanted to unify with gravitation , the typical fiber .",
    "this formulation pretended to be a fundamental theory of all interactions , because it unified all the yang - mills gauge theories with gravitation .",
    "nevertheless , it is now believed that a superstrings theory could be the fundamental theory of all interactions , among other reasons , because it contains the kaluza - klein theories ( kk ) in its low energy limit . in this case , kk become effective theories for yang - mills and gravitational fields instead of fundamental ones .    in ref.@xcite ,",
    "macias , camacho and matos ( mcm ) considered an effective eight - dimensional theory , supplemented with the yukawa and the fermionic sectors as in the standard model and , as expected , the weinberg , glashow and salam model was recovered ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "then , some questions arose .",
    "how is the cosmology predicted by this standard model in curved space - time ?",
    "is there inflation in this cosmology ? which scalar field plays the role of the inflaton ?",
    "what is its relation with the higgs field ? in this paper",
    "we begin with the eight - dimensional kaluza - klein - dirac theory of ref.@xcite in order construct the cosmology of an effective particle theory for the electroweak standard model in a curved space - time , and answer at least partially these questions .",
    "following kerner @xcite and cho @xcite , who established the appropiated general structure of the metric on the bundle in order to consider a non - abelian lie gauge group @xmath0 , mcm set up the metric :    @xmath1 \\otimes \\left [ dx^{5}+k\\;a_{\\nu } ( x)\\;dx^{\\nu } \\right ] \\vspace{0.3 cm } \\\\   & \\hspace{-1cm}-i^{\\dagger } ( x)i(x)\\;\\gamma _ { ij}(y)\\left [ dy^{i}+\\frac{k}{% l_{.}}\\;k_{\\alpha } ^{i}(y)\\;a_{\\mu } ^{\\alpha } ( x)\\;dx^{\\mu } \\right ] \\otimes   \\left [ dy^{j}+\\frac{k}{l_{.}}\\;k_{\\beta } ^{j}(y)\\;a_{\\nu } ^{\\beta } ( x)\\;dx^{\\nu } \\right ] \\ ; , \\end{array } \\label{metrica8dim}\\ ] ]    where @xmath2 is the metric of the isospace manifold , @xmath3 are its killing vectors , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the gauge potentials .",
    "mcm considered @xmath6 as a structure group of the eletroweak interactions . here",
    "@xmath7 plays the role of the dilaton of the theory and also gives the radius of the @xmath8 part of the isospace .",
    "the field @xmath9 is endowed with a three dimensional spinorial structure and plays the role of a higgs field in the effective theory .",
    "this field enters into the metric through the scalar combination @xmath10 and is associated to the radius of the @xmath11 part of the isospace . in eq.([metrica8dim ] ) , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are scaling costants .",
    "they used the following action    @xmath14 + { \\cal l}_{d}\\right ) \\;.",
    "\\label{acd8}\\ ] ]    in eq.([acd8 ] ) , @xmath15 is the higgs potential and @xmath16 represents the terms for the yukawa couplings . from this theory , they obtained the four - dimensional effective eletroweak part of the standard model .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the masses of the gauge bosons and of the first two fermion families were correctly given by this theory . here , we are interested in studying the cosmological implications of this kind of approach",
    ". we can represent the matter content of the universe as a perfect fluid describing a highly energetic and isotropic radiation .",
    "then , instead of the dirac lagrangian , @xmath17 , we will use a perfect fluid lagrangian .",
    "we will also neglect the yukawa interactions terms @xmath18 .",
    "finally , we will assume that the metric @xmath19 for the base space - time @xmath20 is given by the robertson - walker metric and that both the scalar @xmath7 and spinorial @xmath9 fields depend only on time , @xmath21 ; otherwise , they could be used to distinguish between different directions in space - time , invalidating our assumption of the isotropy of the early universe .",
    "in this way , all of the terms involving the gauge fields , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , do not have to be explicitely accounted for in writing the final equations of motion .    from this model",
    "we obtain that the inflaton @xmath24 is produced in a natural way as a combination of the scalar fields @xmath25 and @xmath26 ; in this way , we asign a geometrical origin to the inflaton : it is related to the radius of the internal space , the isospin space . on the other hand",
    ", inflation takes place by a phase transition of the ( electroweak ) higgs field , i.e. the scalar field that generates inflation and the scalar field that gives mass to particles are related .",
    "so , depending on the particular inflationary potential that is used , this model allows that these two roles , of the same field , may be played in two different steps . according to this model , a part of the internal space deflates while the space - time inflates",
    "; after some time , the scalar field settles to a constant , while the space - time keeps expanding .",
    "then another question arises : how can the same scalar field be responsible for these two different phenomena at the origin of the universe ? in the concluding remarks we give a partial answer to this problem . using the simplification of modelling the matter contribution as a perfect fluid",
    ", we obtain an approximation of the behavior of the internal space and the well - known evolution of space - time .",
    "we start with metric ( [ metrica8dim ] ) . following mcm ,",
    "( see also j. toms in his review essay on the kaluza  klein theory , @xcite ) in order to easily calculate geometrical quantities of this metric , we change to a horizontal lift basis @xmath27 defined by the relations    @xmath28    evidently , this basis is not holonomic ; its commutation relations can be easily derived ( see t. matos and a. nieto , @xcite ) .",

    "the metric takes a diagonal form .",
    "finally , the space ricci scalar curvature reads    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the scalar curvature of the space - time manifold @xmath20 and @xmath35 , which is a constant in our case , is the scalar curvature of the isospace manifold @xmath36 .",
    "it should be noticed that we have used an effective version of kaluza - klein theory .",
    "it seems to us that this is the most appropiate way to include the standard model into a theory of gravitation , see refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following action defined in the eight  dimensional double fiber bundle space @xmath37 :    @xmath38    where we introduce @xmath39 on dimensional grounds .",
    "we begin using the eight - dimensional theory with a potential of the form    @xmath40    and we include the lagrangian @xmath41 to represent , when the dimensional compactification has been achieved , the matter content of the universe .    according to eq.([metrica8dim ] ) , the determinant of the metric , @xmath42 , is given by    @xmath43    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the coupling between the curvature scalar and the fields @xmath46 and @xmath47 will lead us , after dimensional reduction , to a brans  dicke theory .",
    "we prefer to make a conformal transformation in order to avoid this coupling .",

    "this action is the main result of this section .",
    "it should be noticed that two surface terms have been dropped out in obtaining the effective action ( [ actionefec ] ) .",
    "this can actually be done by imposing the following boundary conditions    @xmath67    summarizing , the process we have followed to get an effective four dimensional action @xmath68 from the eight  dimensional action @xmath69 , is    @xmath70    which is usually called a dimensional compactification procedure by isometry , see ref .",
    "it is straightforward to get the equation of motion for the different fields of this theory from the effective four  dimensional action @xmath68 , eq.([actionefec ] ) .",
    "the corresponding einstein equations read    @xmath71    where we have made use of the following definition    @xmath72    and @xmath73 stands for the energy - momentum tensor of the matter content of the universe .    in turn , the equation for the scalar field @xmath63 becomes    @xmath74    finally the equations for the yang - mills fields are    @xmath75    and    @xmath76    there is , additionally , a conservation equation @xmath77 .",
    "it is interesting to note the role played in this system of equations by the isospace scale factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 of the conformally transformed metric @xmath53 .",
    "they appear explicitly through the combination    @xmath80    which can be deduced at once from equations ( [ nuevasidentidades ] ) , ( [ caray ] ) , and ( [ sus4dimsegprim ] ) .",
    "we see , in einstein s equations ( [ moveins ] ) , that @xmath78 appears as an effective coupling constant for the electromagnetic field .",
    "analogously , the scale factor @xmath79 appears in front of the yang - mills energy ",
    "momentum tensor density .",
    "both these factors appear again in the scalar field equation of motion , eq.([sigmamov ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the scale factors @xmath78 and @xmath79 are not independent but are related through the equation    @xmath81    it is also interesting that the scalar field @xmath63 should satisfy the boundary condition    @xmath82    which is a consequence of the boundary condition we imposed on the fields @xmath78 and @xmath79 , eq . ( [ front ] ) .",
    "this condition translates in a limitation on the asymptotic behavior of the scalar field @xmath63 and therefore , on the whole theory we are constructing .",
    "let us consider a very special case of the system of equations derived from the effective four  dimesional action @xmath68 , eq .",
    "( [ actionefec ] ) .",
    "if we consider that the metric @xmath83 , eq .",
    "( [ metrica8dim ] ) , describes the very early universe , then we can assume the following statements :    1 .",
    "we can represent the matter content of the universe as a perfect fluid of a highly energetic and isotropic radiation , which presents no interaction .",
    "the energy momentum tensor associated with the lagrangian @xmath84 is then given by @xmath85 .",
    "2 .   in this way ,",
    "all the terms involving the gauge fields , @xmath31 , @xmath86 do not have to be taken explicitly into account .",
    "it is assumed that the universe was isotropical in its early stages of evolution .",
    "consequently , the metric @xmath87 for the base space @xmath20 is taken as the robertson - walker metric and both the scalar @xmath46 and spinorial @xmath9 fields are taken to depend only on time .    in this case , the system of differential equations , eqs.([moveins])-([campomov * ] ) becomes    @xmath88    which is clearly the system of equations for the standard cosmological model filled with a perfect fluid and endowed with a scalar field .",
    "the potential term @xmath89 has been taken arbitrarily until now but , with an appropriate choice , this system of equations can lead us to inflationary solutions ; in this sense , we can argue that the scalar field @xmath63 may play the role of the inflaton of the very early universe .    there",
    "exist well known inflationary solutions for this system of equations ; see for example ref .",
    "@xcite for a review of the inflationary paradigm .",
    "most of such inflationay solutions are in agreement with the boundary conditions we imposed for the inflaton @xmath63 in eq.([boundary ] ) .",
    "what this condition means concerning the inflaton is that , after a long enough time , say @xmath90 , the inflaton settles down to its _ vacuum value _ @xmath91 .",
    "let us follow the evolution of the internal space resulting from some specific behavior of the scalar field @xmath63 .",
    "we choose a couple of exact inflationary solutions for the system of equations ( [ sistfinal ] ) , which were found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also , for example , @xcite and @xcite for a singular - free cosmology )",
    ". these solutions are not realistic since they do not describe radiation or matter dominated epochs , but have the advantage that they are exact and follow the evolution of the scalar field through several epochs of expansion of a multi component universe .",
    "the first case corresponds to the potential @xmath92 , with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "the solution describes a closed universe , with a scale factor given by @xmath93 .",
    "the exact solution for the scalar field is @xmath94 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "when @xmath95 goes to zero , the scalar field @xmath96 goes to infinity , then the universe inflates and the scalar field experiences a rapid decay followed by an epoch of slow variation , during the standard decelarated expansion .",
    "the behavior of the isospace scale factors is : @xmath79 initiates at infinity and @xmath97 begins from zero and eventually both fields remain almost constant ( see figure 1 ) . since this solution is periodic , when the spacetime starts to contract again the scalar field decreases and goes to @xmath98 after a deflationary epoch .",
    "another interesting solution from which we can see the qualitative behavior of the fields , is given by @xmath99 ; @xmath100 , for the potential @xmath101 . here",
    ", the scalar field goes to infinity as @xmath95 approaches zero , but it quickly settles in the constant value @xmath102 , which correspondes to the minimum of the scalar potential @xmath89 , i.e. the system experiences a phase transition as @xmath95 separates from zero",
    ". meanwhile , the spacetime inflates exponentially and the @xmath11 part of the innerspace contracts quickly reaching a constant value , while the @xmath8 part of the innerspace grows from zero , reaches a constant value , and remains there ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "this means that a universe with these features experiences an inflationary spacetime epoch while part of the isospin space contracts and the other part expands .",
    "we used an effective theory in eight dimensions that contains the standard model , in the sense that , in the weak gravitational field limit , we can recover all the predictions of the standard model .",
    "so we can consider it as an effective model for the standard model in curved space and we consider it is interesting to study the cosmology resulting from it .",
    "it can be used to study the influence of the electroweak interaction on the very early universe .",
    "we obtain a geometrical interpretation for the scalar field @xmath24 , as a combination of the innerspace radii .",
    "the scale factors that were identified with higgs fields in @xcite , are recombined here in a scalar field that can be associated to the inflaton .",
    "an important issue for this idendification is that the inflationary evolution leads to a reasonable behavior for the internal radii .",
    "we have proved that , for two particular exact solutions , the two innerspace radii effectively tend to a constant value soon after the inflationary regime .",
    "in such a way , they are rendered invisible in the present universe .",
    "we still have to build a complete picture and understand how this field , that can be identified with a higgs and an inflaton , manages to play both roles effectively .",
    "we think that the solution should be in two stages , i.e. that each process corresponds to a different step .",
    "unfortunatly , due to the simplification we are making ( namely the description of the yang - mills fields as a perfect fluid ) we can not quantitatively predict the system s behavior after the potential reaches its minimum ; one expects that quantum fluctuations provoke a reheating mechanism and maybe the system gets to a local maximum of the potential ( see @xcite ) .",
    "a standard cosmological phase transition occurs by the rolling of the higgs field from a metastable maximum to a minimum of the potential . in our case",
    ", the scalar field @xmath24 goes to the local minimum through infinity , without passing through the metastabe maximum of the potential @xmath103 .",
    "however , we can expect that the scalar field @xmath24 would undergo another phase transition at a later stage , giving the adequate masses to fermions .",
