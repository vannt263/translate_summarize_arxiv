    "it has been confirmed that the cluster expansion in the numerical calculation for @xmath0o shows the good convergence at the three - body cluster level .",
    "we may say that since we consider the @xmath14 nuclei around @xmath0o in the present study , the three - body cluster terms do not have a significant contribution to the energy difference between the single - particle ( -hole ) levels of the proton and neutron .",
    "therefore , in the present calculation , we neglect the three - body cluster terms for simplicity .",
    "the evaluation of the three - body cluster terms based on the particle basis is a further challenge which should be accomplished for a deeper understanding of nuclei .    in the following subsections , we present a general framework for deriving an effective interaction and a practical method for the structure calculation in the present study .      in the usual sense of effective interaction theory ,",
    "an effective interaction is defined in a low - momentum model space ( @xmath15 space ) . however , in general , one can also derive an effective interaction in the complement ( @xmath16 space ) of the @xmath15 space by making the decoupling condition for the effective interaction @xmath17 as @xmath18 .",

    "in nuclear many - body problems , how to determine the single - particle potential for particle ( unoccupied ) states as well as hole ( occupied ) states is important in connection with the evaluation of many - body correlations  @xcite .",
    "in our calculations , the single - particle potential , which is determined self - consistently with the two - body effective interaction , is calculated up to a sufficiently high - momentum region . in general",
    ", this choice of the single - particle potential leads to a deeper binding of the ground - state energy of a nucleus in the lowest order .",
    "then , effects of the many - body correlations of higher order become smaller than the choice of only the kinetic energy for the particle state",
    ". this trend would be favorable when the evaluation of many - body correction terms has to be limited in the actual calculation .    in our earlier calculations ,",
    "the effective interaction was derived by a three - step procedure with some approximations to take account of single - particle potentials up to a high - momentum region . in the present work , however , we adopt a two - step procedure and approximation methods are refined , because the performance of the computer has been greatly improved and some approximations in the previous works are not needed at present . in the following , we shall give the two - step procedure for the numerical calculation .      in this work",
