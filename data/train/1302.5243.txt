    "the parallel alignment of both electric fields results in an inverted dependence of the screening of the dipole upon increasing the acceptor concentration ; increasing the acceptor concentration increases the electric field in the capacitor and due to the parallel alignment the voltage drop at the interface increases .",

    "<S> the ultra - thin pb films were prepared in three steps consisting of ( i ) cleaning of the substrate by flashing above t @xmath3 1300 k to obtain the si(111)-(7@xmath707 ) reconstruction , ( ii ) deposition of @xmath53 3 ml of pb from a knudsen cell and subsequent annealing at 600 k for 60 sec . to form the dense @xmath71r30@xmath72 surface reconstruction @xcite , and ( iii ) deposition of thin crystalline pb films at t  =  80 k. </S>",
    "<S> the films on both substrates were prepared by depositing the same amount of pb with a rate of @xmath53 0.3 ml / min . the room temperature substrate resistance @xmath73 and donor concentrations n@xmath74 are for pb / h - si(111 ) : r = 4 @xmath75 cm , n@xmath74 = 1.14 @xmath76 @xmath55 , for pb / m - si(111 ) : r = 53 @xmath75 cm , n@xmath74 = 8.38 @xmath77 @xmath55 and for pb / l - si(111 ) : r = 95 @xmath75 cm , n@xmath74 = 4.65 @xmath77 @xmath55 .    </S>",
    "<S> all measurements were performed with the cophee end - station at the swiss light source of the paul - scherrer - institute @xcite at a base pressure below 3@xmath7010@xmath78 mbar . </S>",
    "<S> the sample temperature during the measurements was 80 k. the energy and angular resolution of our spin - resolved ( spin - integrated ) arpes measurements were set to 100 ( 25 ) mev and @xmath79 0.75@xmath80 ( 0.5@xmath80 ) in respect of the low efficiency of mott - scattering . in all measurements </S>",
    "<S> a photon energy of 24 ev was used because of the optimal photoemission cross - section for pb qws @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the arpes spectrometer is equipped with two orthogonally mounted mott detectors operated at an acceleration voltage of 40 kv @xcite ( see fig . [ fig1](b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> each mott detector measures asymmetries of the photoelectron current backscattered elastically off a polycrystalline gold foil , defined as @xmath81 , with @xmath82 being the intensity measured in either right ( r ) or left ( l ) detector . </S>",
    "<S> the orthogonal arrangement of the two mott detectors allows to measure asymmetries in a@xmath83 , a@xmath84 and a@xmath85 directions of the mott coordinate system ( @xmath86 ) . </S>",
    "<S> three - dimensional spin polarization data is then obtained by dividing asymmetries by the sherman function ( s = 0.068 ) , and by applying a rotation matrix ( t ) in order to transform the spin polarization components from the mott reference frame into the sample coordinate system : @xmath87 with i @xmath88 ( x , y , z ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we employed density functional theory in the local density approximation @xcite , using the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave method in thin film geometry @xcite . this allows us to expose the structure , consisting of a ten layer pb film placed commensurately on six layers of si(111 ) substrate with a h - terminated backside , to an external electric field . </S>",
    "<S> this field is generated by effective condenser plates put in the vacuum at a distance of 5.3 above and below the film structure . to simulate the si - doping , </S>",
    "<S> we charge only the condenser plate below the si and add the screening charge to the si substrate .    </S>",
