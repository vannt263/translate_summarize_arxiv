    "we focus on a unit cell comprising four square domains [ fig .",
    "[ figs1](a ) ] and deform it uniaxially along one set of cuts ( i.e. @xmath2 ) by applying a macroscopic stress @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the force applied to the hinges on the vertical boundaries and @xmath42 denotes its cross sectional area [ fig .  [ figs1](b ) ] .",
    "it is important to note that using standard axis transformation techniques it has been shown that the planar response of such perforated sheets is not affected by the loading direction @xmath34  @xcite .",
    "therefore , although here for the sake of simplicity we consider @xmath2 , we expect @xmath10 to be identical for any loading direction ( i.e. for any value of @xmath34 ) .",
    "the applied uniaxial stress generates identical bending moments @xmath43 at all hinges , which in turn induce the rotation of all square domains by an angle @xmath44 and the opening of the all cuts by an angle @xmath45 [ fig .",
    "[ figs1](b ) ] . focusing on a single square domain [ fig .",
    "[ figs1](c ) ] , it is easy to see that : @xmath46 moreover , since @xmath43 must be balanced by the couple induced by the internal loads , we have : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the second moment of area of each hinge about the @xmath49-axis and @xmath50 denotes the curvature of each bent hinge . assuming that the length of the bent region of the hinge is approximately equal to the hinge width @xmath5 , we obtain : @xmath51      moreover , since the strain in the loading direction is given by : @xmath53 in the small deformation regime ( i.e. @xmath54 ) we have : @xmath55 so that @xmath56 it follows that the effective young s modulus of perforated sheet , @xmath10 , is : @xmath57    finally , we note that considering each hinge as a beam of thickness @xmath5 and width @xmath3 , its strain energy density under in - plane deformation can be calculated as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the volume of the unit cell",

    "* the stress - strain curves reported in fig .",
    "1a of the main text also show that the thin samples ( i.e.  @xmath12 ) are characterized by a sudden departure from linearity to a plateau stress .",
    "this sudden departure from linearity is the result of out - of - plane buckling of the ligaments and occurs when the out - of - plane deformation of the hinges becomes energetically less costly than their in - plane deformation . while the strain energy density of a perforated sheet that has deformed in - plane is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq_s10 ] ) , the strain energy density of a perforated sheet that has deformed out - of plane can be expressed as : @xmath61 where @xmath14 is the critical strain at which buckling occurs and @xmath15 is energy contribution due to the out - of - plane deformation .    since @xmath62 and the stress immediately after instability is almost constant [ fig .",
    "[ figs2](b ) ] , it follows that @xmath63 is approximately linear in @xmath16 [ fig .",
    "[ figs2](a ) ] and can be identified as the tangent of @xmath64 at @xmath14 :          where @xmath19 is the second moment of area with respect to @xmath67-axis ( @xmath68-axis ) for hinges along @xmath68-axis ( @xmath67-axis ) , @xmath69 is the out - of - plane curvature of the deformed hinges and @xmath70 is the opening angle of an hinge after out - of - plane buckling . note that , in general , after buckling the opening angles of the hinges within the perforate sheet can take two values , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( i.e. not all hinges open equally after buckling ) .    while eq .",

    "<S> first , we use the simulations to understand how plastic deformation evolves . by monitoring the distribution of the von mises stress within the sheets , we find that that plastic deformation initiates at the tip of hinges well after the buckling onset [ see figs .  s6  and  s9 ] and then gradually expand to fully cover the hinges when the sample is fully stretched and the deformation mechanism changes from bending - dominated to stretching - dominated . </S>",
    "<S> second , we numerically explore the effect of different loading conditions and find that uniaxial tension is the ideal one to trigger the formation of well - organized out - of - plane patterns in our perforated sheets [ see fig . </S>",

    "<S> third , we investigate the effect of the loading direction by simulating the response of periodic unit cells . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) we report the stress - strain responses obtained numerically for perforated sheets characterized by @xmath30 and @xmath31 loaded uniaxially for @xmath2 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4](a ) ] and macroscopic in - plane poisson s ratio [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) ] are similar for different values of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , we find that the morphology of the 3d patterns induced by the instability is significantly affected by @xmath34 [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](c)-(d ) ] . as the loading directions varies from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , the symmetry in opening angle of the two sets of perpendicular cuts breaks . </S>",
    "<S> while for @xmath1 all cuts open equally ( i.e. @xmath35 ) , as we reduce @xmath34 , one set becomes wider ( i.e. @xmath36 monotonically increases ) and the other progressively narrower ( i.e. @xmath37 monotonically decreases)[fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](d ) , movie  5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , permanent folds with direction controlled by @xmath34 can be introduced by largely stretching the perforated sheets . as such , by controlling the loading direction a variety of kirigami sheets can be formed [ movie  6 ] . while all of them are laterally flat - foldable , we find that by increasing @xmath34 from @xmath38 to @xmath33 the resulting kirigami sheets have higher bending rigidity and their gaussian curvature varies from zero ( for @xmath2 ) to large negative values ( for @xmath1 ) . furthermore , by increasing @xmath34 , the resulting kirigami sheets become more compliant under torsion ( movie  6 in supplemental material  @xcite ) .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> our combined experimental , analytical and numerical study indicates that buckling in thin sheets perforated with a square array of cuts and subjected to uniaxial tension can be exploited to form 3d patterns and even create periodic arrangements of permanent folds . </S>",
    "<S> while buckling phenomena in cracked thin plates subjected to tension have traditionally been regarded as a route toward failure  @xcite , we show that they can also be exploited to transform flat perforated sheets to kirigami surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> our buckling - induced strategy not only provides a simple route for manufacturing kirigami sheets , but can also be combined with optimization techniques to design perforated patterns capable of generating desired complex 3d surfaces under external loading  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , since the response of our perforated sheets is essentially scale - free , the proposed _ pop - up _ strategy can be used to fabricate kirigami sheets over a wide range of scales , from transformable meter - scale architectures to tunable nano - scale surfaces  @xcite . </S>"
