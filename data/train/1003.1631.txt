    "the normal and conormal cycles of a reasonably well behaved subset @xmath1 of an oriented euclidean space @xmath2 of dimension @xmath3 are currents that encode rather subtle topological and geometric features of the set .",
    "the normal cycle @xmath4 is a legendrian cycle contained in the unit sphere bundle @xmath5 associated to the tangent bundle @xmath6 , while the conormal cycle is a lagrangian cycle @xmath7 in the cotangent bundle @xmath8 .",
    "the two objects completely determine each other in a canonical fashion .",
    "their precise definitions are rather sophisticated in general , but they can be easily described in many concrete examples .",
    "for example , if @xmath1 is a submanifold of @xmath2 , then @xmath4 can be identified with the integration current defined by the total space of the unit sphere bundle associated to the normal bundle of the embedding @xmath9 , while @xmath7 can be identified with the current of integration defined by the total space of the conormal bundle of the embedding @xmath9 .",
    "the normal cycle @xmath4 is intimately related to h. weyl s celebrated tube formula @xcite .",
    "more precisely , there exist canonical forms ( see @xcite ) @xmath10 such that , for any compact submanifold @xmath9 , the integrals @xmath11 can be expressed as integrals over @xmath1 of universal polynomials in the curvature of the induced metric on @xmath1 .",
    "for example , if @xmath12 , then @xmath13 is the @xmath14-dimensional volume of @xmath1 , and @xmath15 coincides ( up to a universal multiplicative constant ) with the integral over @xmath1 of the scalar curvature .",
    "the quantity @xmath16 is the euler characteristic of @xmath1 which , according to the gauss - bonnet theorem , can be expressed as the integral of a universal polynomial in the curvature of of @xmath1 .",
    "the quantities @xmath17 are known as _ curvature measures_. they are the key ingredients in the tube formula that states that for any sufficiently small @xmath18 the volume of a tube of radius @xmath19 around a compact submanifold @xmath9 of dimension @xmath14 is ( see @xcite ) @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the volume of the unit @xmath22-dimensional ball .",
    "if @xmath1 happens to be a bounded domain in @xmath2 with sufficiently regular boundary @xmath23 , then we have a unit outer normal vector field @xmath24 and the normal cycle @xmath4 the integration current defined by the graph of the above map ; see example [ ex : reg ] . in this case the integrals @xmath25 can be expressed as integrals over @xmath23 of universal polynomials in the second fundamental form of the hypersurface @xmath23 , and they are involved in a tube formula similar to ( [ eq : tube ] ) , @xcite .",
    "if additionally @xmath1 happens to be convex , then the curvature measures @xmath17 coincide with the _ quermassintegrale _ constructed by h. minkowski , @xcite .    in the groundbreaking work",
    "@xcite h. federer has explained how to associate curvature measures to subsets of @xmath2 of positive reach .",
    "this class of subsets contain as subclasses the smooth submanifolds of @xmath2 , the bounded domains with smooth boundary and the convex bodies in @xmath2 , and in these cases federer s curvature measures specialize to the curvature measures described above .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the _ quermasseintegrale _ can be extended in a canonical fashion to finitely additive measures ( valuations ) defined on the collection of polyconvex subsets of @xmath2 , i.e. , sets that are finite unions of convex bodies .",
    "in particular , the quantity @xmath17 is well defined for any compact @xmath26 subset of @xmath2 . for most @xmath26 sets the gauss map ( [ eq : g1 ] ) is not defined and the above definition of @xmath4 is meaningless .    in the mid 1980s , j. cheeger ,",
    "s. mller and r .schrader @xcite have associated to an arbitrary compact @xmath26 subset @xmath27 a legendrian cycle @xmath28 contained in @xmath5 such that @xmath29 their elementary construction is very intuitive and is based on elementary morse theory on @xmath26-spaces . moreover",

    "the paper @xcite includes the first formal definition of the normal cycle . roughly speaking , the normal cycle @xmath4 is designed to be an ingenious catalogue of the morse theoretic behavior of the restrictions to @xmath1 of `` typical '' linear functions on @xmath2 .    a few years after @xcite , m. kashiwara and p. schapira",
    "@xcite have shown how to associate a normal cycle to any bounded subanalytic subset of @xmath2 .",
    "although the morse theoretic point of view is still in the background , their approach is sheaf theoretic and geared towards topological applications .",
    "their proof is quite sophisticated as it relies on highly nontrivial results about the derived categories of sheaves .",
    "j. schrmann @xcite has proposed a simpler sheaf theoretic construction of the normal cycle , but this too requires a good familiarity with stratified spaces the basic operations in the derived category of sheaves .    almost immediately following the work of kashiwara and schapira , j. fu @xcite gave another construction of the normal cycle of a subanalytic set using methods of geometric measure theory .",
    "his proof is technically very demanding , and the complete details are spread over several papers .    very recently , a. berning @xcite has proposed a very ingenious and elegant elementary construction of the normal cycle of a subanalytic set using the recent advances in @xmath0-minimal topology and basic facts about currents . unfortunately there is a flaw in a key existence result , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 6.4 ) ; see remark [ rem : glitch](a ) for more detail;s .",
    "the present paper grew out of our attempts to fix that flaw .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to describe a very short complete proof of the existence of the normal cycle of a subanalytic set by relying on techniques and ideas from @xmath0-minimal topology .",
    "we rely on several fundamental facts of geometric measure theory that we survey in appendix [ s : c ] .",
    "the construction has a morse theoretic flavor , and it is based on two key principles .    * _ an uniqueness result closely related to the uniqueness results of j. fu ( * ? ? ?",
    "_ loosely speaking , this uniqueness result states that there exists a unique legendrian cycle in @xmath33 that catalogs in a certain explicit fashion ( see remark [ rem : normc](a ) ) the morse theoretic properties of the restrictions to @xmath1 of generic linear functions on @xmath2 . when it exists , this unique cycle is the normal cycle @xmath4 of @xmath1 . * _ an approximation process pioneered by j. fu @xcite . _",
    "more precisely , we show that for any compact subanalytic set @xmath1 we can find a family of bounded domains @xmath34 with @xmath35-boundaries such that @xmath36 and the normal cycles @xmath37 converge in the sense of currents to a current satisfying the requirements of the uniqueness theorem .",
    "thus , the limit cycle must be the normal cycle of @xmath1 .",
