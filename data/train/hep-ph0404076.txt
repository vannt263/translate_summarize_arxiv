    "radiative decays of vector mesons offer the possibility of investigating new physics features about the interesting mechanism involved in these decays .",
    "one particular mechanism involves the exchange of scalar mesons .",
    "the scalar mesons , isoscalar @xmath2 and @xmath0 and isovector @xmath5 , with vacuum quantum numbers @xmath6 are known to be crucial for a full understanding of the low energy qcd phenomenology and the symmetry breaking mechanisms in qcd .",
    "the scalar mesons have been a persistent problem in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "in addition to the identification of their nature , the role of scalar mesons in hadronic processes is of extreme importance and the study of radiative decays of vector mesons may provide insights about their role .",
    "in particular , radiative @xmath7 meson decays , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , can play a crucial role in the clarification of the structure and properties of scalar @xmath0 and @xmath5 mesons since these decays primarily proceed through processes involving scalar resonances such as @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with the subsequent decays into @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "achasov and ivanchenko @xcite showed that if the @xmath0 and @xmath5 resonances are four - quark @xmath14 states the processes @xmath10 and @xmath11 are dominant and enhance the decays @xmath8 and @xmath9 by at least an order of magnitude over the results predicted by the wess - zumino terms .",
    "then close et al .",
    "@xcite noted that the study of the scalar states in @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , may offer unique insights into the nature of the scalar mesons .",
    "they have shown that although the transition rates @xmath17 and @xmath18 depend on the unknown dynamics , the ratio of the decay rates @xmath19 provides an experimental test which distinguishes between alternative explanations of their structure . on the experimental side ,",
    "the novosibirsk cmd-2 @xcite and snd @xcite collaborations give the following branching ratios for @xmath20 and @xmath9 decays : @xmath21 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite , where the first error is statistical and the second one is systematic .",
    "theoretically , the role of @xmath0-meson in the radiative decay processes @xmath8 was also investigated by achasov et al .",
    "they calculated the branching ratio for this decay by considering only @xmath0-meson contribution .",
    "they used two different models of @xmath0-meson : the four - quark model and @xmath24 molecular model . in the four - quark model they obtained the value for the branching ratio as @xmath25 and in case of the @xmath24 molecular model ,",
    "the branching ratio was @xmath26 .",
    "later , marco et al . considered the radiative @xmath7 meson decays @xcite as well as other radiative vector meson decays within the framework of chiral unitary theory developed earlier by oller @xcite .",
    "they obtained the result @xmath27 for the branching ratio of the @xmath20 decay and emphasized that the branching ratio for @xmath20 decay is twice the one for @xmath28 decay .",
    "recently , the radiative @xmath28 decay , where the scalar @xmath0-meson plays an important role was studied by gkalp and ylmaz @xcite within the framework of a phenomenological approach in which the contributions of @xmath2-meson , @xmath3-meson and @xmath29-meson are considered .",
    "they analyzed the interference effects between different contributions .",
    "their analysis showed that @xmath0-meson amplitude makes a substantial contribution to the branching ratio of this decay .",
    "furthermore , recently escribano has been studied the scalar meson exchange in @xmath30 decays @xcite .",
    "he discussed the scalar contributions to the @xmath28 , @xmath9 and @xmath31 decays in the framework of the linear sigma model ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "he obtained the result @xmath33 for the branching ratio of the @xmath28 decay and noted that , the branching ratio for this decay is dominated by @xmath0 meson amplitude .    in this work , we study the radiative vector meson decay @xmath20 to investigate the role of the scalar @xmath0 meson and to extract the relevant information on the properties of this scalar meson . theoretically , the radiative @xmath20 decay has not been studied extensively up to now .",
    "one of the rare studies of this decay was by marco et al .",
    "@xcite who neglected the contributions coming from intermediate vector meson states",
    ". therefore , this decay should be reconsidered and the vmd amplitude should be added to the @xmath29-meson and @xmath2-meson amplitudes .",
    "we study the radiative decay @xmath34 within the framework of a phenomenological approach in which the contributions of @xmath2-meson , @xmath3-meson and @xmath29-meson are considered and we do not make any assumption about the structure of the @xmath4 meson . in our phenomenological approach",
    "we describe the @xmath35-vertex by the effective lagrangian @xmath36 and for the @xmath37-vertex we use the phenomenological lagrangian @xmath38    @xmath39 -2 cm    the effective lagrangians for the @xmath35- and @xmath40-vertices also serve to define the coupling constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "the decay width for the @xmath43 decay is obtained from the lagrangian given in eq . 1 and this decay width is @xmath44^{3/2}~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then obtain the coupling constant @xmath45 from the experimental partial width @xcite of the radiative decay @xmath43 as @xmath46 .",

    "this amplitude is @xmath48~\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the polarizations and four - momenta of the @xmath7 meson and the photon respectively , and also @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath53 function has been calculated in different contexts @xcite and is defined as @xmath54 + \\frac{a}{(a - b)^{2}}\\left [   g(\\frac{1}{b})-g(\\frac{1}{a})\\right ] ~~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55^{2}~ , & ~~x>\\frac{1}{4 } \\\\",

    "is given as @xmath69^{1/2}~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for given values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we use this expression to determine the coupling constant @xmath72 .",
    "therefore , using the experimental values for @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xcite , given as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , we obtain the coupling constant @xmath75 .",
    "the @xmath76-vertex is conventionally described by the effective lagrangian @xmath77 the coupling constant @xmath78 is calculated as @xmath79 by achasov and gubin @xcite using the data on the decay @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath81-vertex the effective lagrangian @xmath82 is used . at present",
    "there is a discrepancy between the experimental widths of the @xmath83 and @xmath84 decays .",
    "we use the experimental rate for the decay @xmath83 @xcite to extract the coupling constant @xmath85 as @xmath86 since the experimental value for the decay rate of @xmath28 was used by gkalp and ylmaz @xcite to estimate the coupling constant @xmath64 .",
    "finally , the @xmath87-vertex is described conventionally by the effective lagrangian @xmath88 in our calculation of the invariant amplitude , we make the replacement @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are four - momentum and mass of the virtual particles respectively , in @xmath3- , @xmath2- and @xmath29- propagators in order to take into account the finite widths of these unstable particles and use the experimental value @xmath92 @xcite for @xmath3-meson . however , since the mass @xmath93 of @xmath29-meson is very close to the @xmath94 threshold this gives rise to a strong energy dependence on the width of the @xmath29-meson and to include this energy dependence different expressions for @xmath95 can be used .",
    "first option is to use an energy dependent width for @xmath29 @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the four - momentum square of the virtual @xmath29-meson and the width @xmath98 is given as @xmath99 we use the experimental value for @xmath100 as @xmath101 @xcite . the width @xmath102 is given by a similar expression as for @xmath98 .",
    "another and widely accepted option is the work of flatt @xcite . in his work , the expression for @xmath102 is extended below the @xmath103 threshold where @xmath104 is replaced by @xmath105 so @xmath102 becomes purely imaginary .",
    "however in our work , we take into account both options . the invariant amplitude @xmath106 is expressed as @xmath107 where @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the invariant amplitudes resulting from the diagrams @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 in fig . 2 respectively .",
    "therefore , the interference between different reactions contributing to the decay @xmath34 is taken into account . the differential decay probability for an unpolarized @xmath7-meson at rest",
    "is given as @xmath116 where e@xmath117 and e@xmath118 are the photon and pion energies respectively .",
    "we perform an average over the spin states of @xmath7-meson and a sum over the polarization states of the photon .",
    "the decay width @xmath119 is then obtained by integration @xmath120 where the minimum photon energy is e@xmath121 and the maximum photon energy is given as @xmath122 .",
    "the maximum and minimum values for the pion energy e@xmath118 are given by @xmath123~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in order to determine the coupling constant @xmath124 , we choose for the @xmath29-meson parameters the values @xmath93 and @xmath125 .",
    "therefore , through the decay rate that results from the effective lagrangian given in eq .",
    "13 we obtain the coupling constant @xmath124 as @xmath126 .",
    "if we use the form for @xmath127 , proposed by flatt @xcite , the desired enhancement in the invariant mass spectrum appears in its central part rather than around the @xmath29 pole .",
    "bramon et al .",
    "@xcite also encountered a similar problem in their study of the effects of the @xmath5 meson in the @xmath128 decay .",
    "therefore , in the analysis which we present below for @xmath129 we use the form given in eq .",
    "the invariant mass distribution @xmath130 for the radiative decay @xmath131 is plotted in fig .",
    "3 as a function of the invariant mass @xmath132 of @xmath133 system . in this figure",
    "we indicate the contributions coming from different reactions @xmath134 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 as well as the contribution of the total amplitude which includes the interference terms as well .",
    "it is clearly seen from fig .",
    "3 that the spectrum for the decay @xmath131 is dominated by the @xmath29-amplitude . on the other hand",
    "the contribution coming from @xmath2-amplitude can only be noticed in the region @xmath137 through interference effects .",
    "likewise @xmath3-meson contribution can be seen in the region @xmath138 so we can say that the contribution of the @xmath29-term is much larger than the contributions of the @xmath2-term and @xmath3-term as well as the contribution of the total interference term having opposite sign .",
    "@xmath39 8.4 cm    the dominant @xmath29-term characterizes the invariant mass distribution in the region where @xmath139 . in our study contributions of different amplitudes to the branching ratio of the decay @xmath131 are @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 and for the total interference term @xmath145 .",
    "we then calculate the total branching ratio as @xmath146 .",
    "our result is twice the theoretical result for @xmath147 decay , obtained by gkalp and ylmaz @xcite , as it should be .",
    "they obtained the following values : @xmath148 , @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "moreover , our calculation for the branching ratio of the radiative decay @xmath154 is nearly twice the value for the branching ratio of the radiative decay @xmath155 that was obtained by achasov and gubin @xcite . besides , @xmath20 decay was considered by marco et al .",
    "@xcite in the framework of unitarized chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the branching ratio for @xmath20 , they obtained , was @xmath156 and for @xmath28 was @xmath157 . as we mentioned above , they noted that the branching ratio for @xmath28 is one half of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore our calculation for the branching ratio of @xmath20 decay is in accordance with the theoretical expectations .",
    "a similar relation can be seen between the decay rates of @xmath158 and @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "it was noticed that @xmath160 and the factor @xmath161 is a result of charge conjugation invariance to order @xmath162 which imposes pion pairs of even angular momentum .",
    "the experimental value of the branching ratio for @xmath20 , measured by akhmetshin et al .",
    ", is @xmath163 @xcite .",
    "so the value of the branching ratio that we obtained is approximately six times larger than the value of the measured branching ratio . as it was stated by marco et al .",
    "@xcite , we should not compare our calculation for the branching ratio of the radiative decay @xmath20 directly with experiment since the experiment is done using the reaction @xmath164 , which interferes with the off - shell @xmath3 dominated amplitude coming from the reaction @xmath165 @xcite .",
    "also the result in @xcite is based on model dependent assumptions .",
