    "the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the nasa compton gamma - ray observatory has revealed a nearly isotropic but inhomogeneous sky distribution of gamma - ray bursts ( meegan et al .",
    "1992 ; @xcite ) .",
    "an additional major constraint on grb theories , revealed by the pioneer venus orbiter ( pvo ) experiment , is that the intensity distribution of bright bursts is consistent with a locally - uniform density of sources in euclidean space ( @xcite ) .",
    "these facts are simply and generically accounted for if the faintest observed grbs come from cosmological distances ( e.g. , paczyski 1995 ) .",
    "an alternative possibility , that we will focus on here , is that the bursts come from the extended halo or corona of our galaxy .",
    "galactic halo models for grbs were first considered and tested against data by fishman et al .",
    "( 1978 ) and jennings & white ( 1980 ) .",
    "reasons for favoring halo models have been summarized by lamb ( 1995 ) .    in galactic halo grb models",
    ", it is often supposed that the bursters are neutron stars , since such compact stars are conjectured to be capable of producing intense fluxes of hard , non - thermal photons ; while their small size could drive burst variability on submillisecond time scales .",
    "other reasons for favoring neutron stars include observations of spectral lines , which are at present controversial , and a possible connection of classic grbs with the march 5 , 1979 gamma ray burster ( e.g. , @xcite , hereafter dt92 ) which was localized to an angular position lying within a young supernova remnant ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the displacement of this burster from the center of the supernova remnant indicates that it acquired a velocity @xmath13 km s@xmath6 at birth ( dt92 ) .",
    "neutron stars with such velocities will escape the galactic disk , and move into the halo .",
    "recent analysis of the 1979 march 5th event lends support to its association with classical grbs ( @xcite , hereafter fkl ) .",
    "in addition , many high - velocity radio pulsars ( @xmath14 km s@xmath6 ) have been observed ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "for these reasons , we will focus on theories of grbs from high - velocity neutron stars ( hvnss ) born in the galactic disk , as first suggested by shklovskii & mitrofanov ( 1985 ) .",
    "in particular , we will consider the `` halo beaming model '' ( hbm ) proposed earlier ( @xcite , hereafter dlt ; @xcite , ldt ; li & duncan , 1996a , 1996b ; bulik & lamb 1996 ) . alternative models for grbs from hvnss in the galactic halo invoke a delayed onset of bursting activity at a time @xmath11 years after birth in the disk ( @xcite , hereafter ld92 ) , which has been applied in several different physical contexts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; and weakly - bound bursters orbiting in a nonspherical galactic potential ( @xcite , hereafter prr ) .",
    "models for bursters _ born _ in the galactic halo ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or the magellanic clouds ( @xcite ) , are beyond the scope of this paper .    in  [ model ] , we will describe our basic model for the galactic population of bursters , and briefly review its physical motivations . in ",
    "[ sec - montecarlo ] we present our basic monte carlo model results .",
    "we discuss how these results arise , and what they could imply for halo grb theories .",
    "we also explore the model s sensitivity to different beaming angles . in  [ sec - hbm - bat - pvo ]",
    "we make detailed quantitative comparisons of the model with batse and pvo data . in particular , we study moments of the angular position distribution in bright subsets of observed grbs , which is potentially a sensitive model discriminant . in  [ sec - eng - rep ] we estimate the grb repetition rate and the energy requirements for bursters .",
    "we also discuss two candidate power sources that could satisfy these requirements : magnetic energy and accretion energy .",
    "several refinements of the basic hbm are investigated in  [ sec - hbm - ext ] ,",
    "namely : gamma - ray intensities that vary with angular position within the beam , grb luminosity functions , and models with a significant subset of bursters on bound orbits in the galactic halo . in  [ sec - conclu ]",
    "we give our conclusions and outline future observational tests .    note that we consider possible physical mechanisms for halo grbs , involving neutron stars with unusually strong magnetic fields , in  2.3 , ",
    "2.4 ,  5 , ",
    "6.3 , and appendix b. these sections could be read separately from the rest of the paper , since they might apply in a non - beamed model context ( cf .  ",
    "we will assume that grbs are emitted by hvnss , which emanate from the galactic disk like a `` wind '' extending into the galactic corona ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hbm does not require that the bursters or their peculiar velocities have any favored orientation in a galactic coordinate frame , but it does invoke the physically - plausible condition that gamma - rays are produced only within a cone of angular radius @xmath1 about the star s magnetic axis @xmath15 . the magnetic axis is furthermore assumed to be roughly aligned ( within @xmath16 ) with the stellar recoil velocity @xmath0 .",
    "we discuss the physics of such beaming and alignment in ",
    "[ sec - phy - beaming ] .    the particular version of hbm which we will analyze quantitatively in  [ sec - montecarlo ] and  [ sec - hbm - bat - pvo ] below has the following simple properties : [ 1 ] bursters are born at positions distributed like young pop .",
    "i stars in the galactic disk ; [ 2 ] with randomly directed recoils @xmath17 km s@xmath6 ; [ 3 ] they emit grbs at a constant rate , with [ 4 ] constant luminosity , and [ 5 ] the gamma ray emission is beamed parallel and anti - parallel to @xmath2 , within an angular radius @xmath1 that we will vary .",
    "grb beaming in a direction correlated with @xmath0 makes the observable burst distribution comply with the batse dipole isotropy and the pvo brightness ",
    "distribution constraints , for the following reasons ( see figure [ fig - hbm - concept ] ) .",
    "since the hvnss are freely  streaming out of the galaxy , their mean density diminishes with distance from the galactic center as @xmath18 .  however , the fraction of escaping bursters that are potentially _ detectable _ at earth increases in proportion to the transverse area of their beaming cones , @xmath19 .",
    "these two trends cancell , making the _ effective _ number of bursters increase linearly with the sampled volume ( i.e. , an apparent  constant density \" of detectable stars ) within a `` core radius '' @xmath20 , where @xmath21 kpc is a galactic disk dimension . in the hbm",
    ", this produces the the observed `` homogeneous '' distribution of bright grbs found by the pvo experiment .",
    "furthermore , since most bursters are undetectable when they are at small @xmath22 , the observable dipole anisotropy of grb positions in the direction of the galactic center is greatly reduced . at distances larger than @xmath23 , _ all _ bursters are detectable at earth ( or nearly all ; see exceptions discussed in  3 ) , and the @xmath24 free - streaming fall - off of burster density prevails , accounting for the `` boundedness '' ( @xmath25 ) found by batse .",
    "a more detailed illustration of the geometrical effect of burst beaming is given in figure [ fig - zoa ] .",
    "to understand this figure , consider for a moment an idealized model in which all stars are born precisely at the galactic center ( gc ) , and move out in random directions on straight  line trajectories , each emitting grbs into a cone of half - opening angle @xmath1 around its velocity vector .",
    "bursters lying outside the circles in figure [ fig - zoa ] , or within the lens - shaped intersection of circles between the gc and earth , are then the only ones that can be detected at earth .",
    "there is a large `` zone of avoidance '' ( zoa ) , within which all bursters are invisible .",
    "figure [ fig - zoa ] actually shows only the 2-d cross - section of this zoa .",
    "the true zoa is the volume of revolution of the pictured shape about the line between earth and the galactic center .",
    "the boundary in figure [ fig - zoa ] at which stars just become observable ( edge of the zoa ) is part of a circle with radius @xmath26 , where @xmath27 kpc is the distance from sun to the galactic center .    in the realistic situation ,",
    "bursters are born throughout the galactic disk , with a peak birth rate at @xmath285 kpc from the center , where the greatest concentration of population i stars are located ( @xcite ) .",
    "each birthplace in the disk then has its own zoa , scaling up or down in linear size with the distance between the birthplace and earth .",
    "one must add the weighted distributions of detectable bursts together to get the total observable grb distribution .",
    "there is no simple , analytic way to do this , so in what follows we will use monte carlo methods .",
    "we will also calculate realistic trajectories in the galactic potential , rather than assuming straight lines .",
    "gamma - ray bursts from high-@xmath29 environments tend to be beamed along field lines because of the transverse pair - creation opacity ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and because gamma rays produced by such mechanisms as curvature radiation and compton upscattering are strongly beamed along field lines ( e.g. , @xcite ; dermer 1990 and references therein ) .",
    "even locally  isotropic emissions are strongly beamed when they occur in a relativistic outflow channeled by a magnetic field ( e.g. , yi 1993 ) .",
    "gamma emissions induced by sheared alfvn waves in a neutron star magnetosphere can also be highly beamed ( melia & fatuzzo 1991 ; fatuzzo & melia 1993 ) .",
    "beaming obviates the @xmath30@xmath30 opacity limit for grbs ( krolik & pier 1991 ; baring 1993 ; fenimore epstein & ho 1993 ) .",
    "the hbm invokes the additional ( assumed ) property that burster recoil velocities are approximately aligned with magnetic dipole  and hence burst beaming  axi : @xmath31 .",
    "this requires that the rotation axis @xmath32 is also roughly aligned with @xmath33 , at least to within the burst opening angle @xmath1 .",
    "is @xmath31 a plausible assumption ?",
    "any recoil mechanism which imparts impulses to the stellar surface with a coherence time longer than the rotation period of the star will tend to make @xmath34 because of  rotational averaging . \"",
    "one such recoil mechanism is anisotropic neutrino emission during the first @xmath35 s after formation (  2.4 below ) .   if it is also true that @xmath36 ( at least to within the beaming angle @xmath1 ) then the alignment condition of the hbm is satisfied .    such near  alignment between @xmath37 and @xmath38",
    "is expected if the neutron star magnetic field is generated by large - scale dynamo action , as in familiar stellar and planetary dynamos .",
    "magnetar \" model , described below (  2.3 ) , is one scenario involving such a dynamo .",
    "vacuum magnetic torques _ increase",
    "_ alignment ( @xcite ; @xcite ) after the star spins down past the  death line \" at which magnetospheric currents are quenched , at age @xmath39 yrs ( chen & ruderman 1993 ) . before this point",
    "is reached , currents might exert counter - aligning torques of comparable strength ( e.g. , mckinnon 1993 and references therein ) .    note",
    "that the grb beaming angle @xmath1 is the sum of the intrinsic beaming angle due to gamma - ray opacity and radiative effects , and the r.m.s .",
    "scatter in the angle between @xmath40 and @xmath33 .",
    "gamma production mechanisms such as curvature radiation and compton upscattering could operate at significant altitudes in the magnetosphere , where field lines are tilted with respect to @xmath41 , yielding larger values of @xmath1 than one would estimate under the assumption of near - polar gamma emission ( as adopted by @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "values as large as @xmath42 are possible .",
    "the hbm might apply in a variety of different physical contexts . here",
    "we will briefly discuss the ",
    "magnetar \" model for grbs ( dt92 ) .",
    "the magnetar idea has previously been invoked in models of soft gamma repeater bursts ( @xcite , hereafter td95 ) as well as in models of continuous x - ray emissions from sgrs and from anomalous x - ray pulsars like 1e2259@xmath43586 ( @xcite , td96 ) .",
    "magnetars are hypothetical neutron stars which are born with dipole fields in excess of @xmath44 g.   how might such stars form ?   neutron stars are hot and convective during the first @xmath35 seconds after they form .",
    "they also undergo strong differential rotation ( td93 ) .",
    "large - scale dynamo action might operate efficiently during this time for neutron stars with mean rotation periods below a threshold comparable to the convective overturn time , as predicted by @xmath45@xmath46 dynamo theory .",
    "there is evidence for such a threshold in magnetically - active main - sequence stars ( e.g. , simon 1990 ) .",
    "_ this threshold effect could give rise to a bimodal population of neutron stars _",
    "(  pulsars and magnetars \" ) with a factor @xmath47 difference in field strength ( dt92 ) . a more detailed explanation of this magnetar formation hypothesis is given by duncan & thompson ( 1996 , dt96 ) .",
    "seven distinct estimates of the field in the bursting neutron star sgr 0526@xmath4866 seem to indicate @xmath49 g ( td95 ) .",
    "g are necessary in sgr 052666 ;   3.2 of td95 explains why we do not favor a model for sgr bursts involving a pure pair plasma confined by a @xmath50 g field , as favored by katz ; and  7.3.2 explains why we do not favor a hydrostatic model in which the magnetic eddington limit operates without confining magnetic stresses , which katz incorrectly attributes to us .",
    "another good argument against hydrostatic models , based on some novel physics , is given by miller ( 1995 ) . ]",
    "magnetars spin down too rapidly to be observed as radio pulsars .",
    "dt92 conjectured that grbs are flare - like reconnection events in a galactic halo population of such strongly - magnetized neutron stars .",
    "we will show in  4.5 that the available magnetic energy is sufficient to power observed grbs , in the context of the hbm ( see also prr ) .",
    "magnetic reconnection is a theoretically advantageous energy source for grbs , for several reasons .",
    "gravitational and nuclear energy releases generally occur in bulk baryonic matter , which has many degrees of freedom into which energy can thermalized and degraded via adiabatic expansion ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". flares in a neutron star magnetosphere , on the other hand , can be ",
    "clean , \" exciting only photon and pair degrees of freedom to a first approximation . large scale electromotive forces induced by reconnection will generally accelerate pairs , and may produce hard , non - thermal spectra via compton upscattering , synchrotron emission , and curvature radiation ( @xcite ) . indeed ,",
    "grbs have many qualitative similarities to stellar flares .",
    "both are transient energy releases , with chaotic variability over a wide range of time scales ; and both have spectrally - hard non - thermal components ( e.g. , murphy et al .  1993 ; ramaty & mandzhavidze 1993 ) .",
    "the similarities are so strong that a minor fraction of bursts in the batse catalog might actually be intense events from nearby , non - neutron , flare stars ( liang & li 1993 ) .",
    "stochastic avalanche models give a good fit to grb time profiles ( stern & svensson 1996 ) and to many properties of solar flares ( lu et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "if the @xmath51@xmath52 correlation observed in some samples of radiopulsars ( e.g. , cordes 1986 ; stollman & van den heuvel 1986 ) is applicable for all neutron stars , then the _ mean _ magnetar recoil velocity would be @xmath53 times larger than the mean for radiopulsars ( but see lorimer , lyne and anderson 1995 ) .",
    "several mechanisms predict unusually large recoils for magnetars , sufficient to propel them into the galactic halo , as explained in  2.4 below .",
    "because of the dynamo origins of magnetar fields , one expects that _ initially _",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are roughly aligned in magnetars .",
    "when the convective overturn time satisfies @xmath56 , thus ",
    "rotational averaging \" implies that @xmath34 ( where @xmath57 ) ;  and @xmath58 because the dipole field is generated by an @xmath45@xmath46 dynamo .",
    "] as the star spins down , magnetospheric currents might drive some degree of misalignment ; however , once the star spins down past the  death line \" at time @xmath59 yrs ( @xcite ) , further spindown certainly enforces alignment ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , since the magnetostatic stellar distortion in magnetars is large enough to damp nutations of @xmath40 about @xmath33 ( @xcite , dlt ) .",
    "incidentally , this is probably not true in old , spun - down ( @xmath60 s ) radiopulsars .",
    "we conclude that @xmath61 is likely to be roughly aligned with @xmath55 in old magnetars , where @xmath55 is also the axis of beamed gamma emissions ( dlt ) .",
    "this scenario for classic grbs assumes that magnetars retain strong dipole magnetic fields .",
    "large - scale magnetic instabilities that reduce @xmath52 ( flowers & ruderman 1979 ) might be suppressed by toroidal field components in the stellar interior , as expected for fields generated via @xmath45@xmath46 dynamos , or perhaps by other mechanisms ( td93  14.2 ) .",
    "note that a dipole field anchored in the stably  stratified liquid interior of a magnetar can not be greatly distorted by spindown - induced crustal tectonic drift ( ruderman 1991 ) because magnetic stresses dominate tensile stresses in the crust .",
    "this might differ markedly from the circumstance in ordinary radiopulsars ( ruderman 1991 ) .",
    "the interactions of vortex lines in the neutron superfluid with superconducting flux tubes are also probably irrelevant for _ young _ magnetars , because the interior field is probably strong enough to suppress superconductivity .",
    "a young magnetar s field evolves predominantly via ambipolar diffusion in the interior and hall fracturing in the crust ( td96 ) .",
    "as the interior field decays , superconductivity will appear in the mantle and perhaps the core ; but this probably happens only after rapid spindown has driven most superfluid vortex lines out of the interior .",
    "further discussion of magnetar evolution is given by prr .",
    "a dipole anisotropy of only @xmath62 in the neutrino emission from a young , hot neutron star would impart a recoil velocity @xmath13 km s@xmath6 to the star ( chugai 1984 ) . here",
    "we briefly review mechanisms whereby neutrino anisotropies could be _ magnetically _ induced .",
    "purely hydrodynamic ( non - magnetic ) mechanisms for producing neutron star recoils have been proposed by janka & mller ( 1994 ) , shimizu , yamada & sato ( 1994 ) , burrows & hayes ( 1996 ) , and in references quoted therein .",
    "a strong magnetic field affects neutrino emissions from the beta processes @xmath63 and @xmath64 , as calculated by dorofeev , rodionov & ternov ( 1985 ) , and from neutrino scattering processes as calculated by vilenkin ( 1995 ) .",
    "dorofeev et al .",
    "and vilenkin furthermore estimated the neutron star recoils resulting from these processes , in the uniform - field idealization .",
    "this is a macroscopic manifestion of parity - nonconservation in the weak interactions .",
    "field correctly . ]    in a realistically non - uniform magnetic field , the back - reaction of magnetic stresses on convective energy flow , along with the neutrino opacity variations outlined above , would give rise to  neutrino starspots , \" analogous to sunspots , and thus produce neutron star recoils of a magnitude estimated in dt92 and  13 of td93 .",
    "these calculations are based on standard weinberg - salam weak interaction theory .",
    "if neutrinos have mass , on the other hand , a strong magnetic field will shift resonant flavor - changing ( msw ) oscillations , thereby also inducing an anisotropy in the emergent neutrino flux from a nascent neutron star ( kusenko & segr 1996 ) .",
    "all of these mechanisms produce recoils which vary directly  usually linearly  with the mean magnetic field strength : @xmath65 .",
    "thus if any of these mechanisms dominate , one would expect much larger recoils for magnetars than for pulsars .",
    "several _ non - neutrino _ recoil mechanisms which also might operate more efficiently in magnetars than in pulsars were discussed by dt92 .",
    "km s@xmath6 , as explained in dt92 . ]    to estimate neutrino magnetic recoils realistically , one must know the strength , coherence length and coherence time of the magnetic field during the epoch of maximum neutrino luminosity .",
    "this is not possible at present .",
    "however , if the magnetic field approaches equipartition with the free energy of differential rotation and/or the convective fluid mixing  which is strongly in the mhd limit",
    " then @xmath66 g at the neutrinosphere ( td93 ) .",
    "such strong fields could be present when most of the neutrino energy is radiated away , even if the surface _",
    "dipole _ field , which is frozen - in tens of seconds later by the onset of stable stratification in the liquid interior ( goldreich & reisenegger 1992 ) , is smaller by a factor of @xmath35 or @xmath67 .",
    "recoils @xmath68 km s@xmath6 are plausible .",
    "by integrating a large number ( @xmath69 ) of neutron star trajectories in a realistic galactic potential , we have derived the sky distribution of hvnss . in the model described here (  3 and  4 )",
    ", all stars have @xmath70 km s@xmath6 ; thus they move in nearly straight lines and eventually escape from the galaxy ( but see  6.3 ) .",
    "we used a monte carlo code developed by li & dermer ( 1992 ) , which in turn follows many of the prescriptions of paczyski ( 1990 ) and hartmann , epstein & woosley ( 1990 ) .",
    "in particular , we adopt van der kruit s ( 1987 ) model for the spatial distribution of young pop .",
    "i stars which spawn neutron stars in the galactic disk .",
    "the trajectories of @xmath69 neutron stars were numerically integrated in a realistic galactic potential ( miyamoto & nagai 1975 ) km s@xmath6 .",
    "this is because the disk is only a very minor part of the total mass of the galaxy . ]",
    "including a dark halo cutoff at radius @xmath71 kpc .",
    "the escape velocity from the center of this model potential is @xmath72 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this increases only logarithmically with @xmath73 , reaching @xmath74 km s@xmath6 for @xmath75 kpc , thus our results are probably insensitive to @xmath73 over its plausible range ( ld92 ) .",
    "deviations from sphericity in the dark halo were neglected ( but see prr ) .",
    "we also do not include the potential of m31 since stars with @xmath76 km s@xmath6 are negligibly perturbed by m31 within the batse sampling depth we found of @xmath77 kpc (  4.1 ) .    in figure [ fig - ang - hbm ]",
    "we show hbm numerical results for several angular statistics , plotted as functions of sampling depth @xmath78 about the earth .",
    "that is , the figure shows cumulative angular statistics for all detectable bursters at distances from earth that are less than or equal to the value of @xmath78 on the horizontal axis .",

    "for example , the number of detectable stars at @xmath91 kpc in our monte carlo model is only @xmath92 for @xmath93 , whereas it is @xmath10 for in the unbeamed case ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "increasing the sampling depth @xmath78 ( moving to the right in figure [ fig - ang - hbm ] ) is tantamount to including fainter and fainter bursts .",
    "eventually the batse sampling depth is reached ; at this point , if the model is to fit observations , all the plotted statistics must simultaneously match batse values to within observational uncertainty . the most recent published batse results .",

    ", we must explain the significance of @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath101 statistic was invented for the study of the quasars ( schmidt 1968 ) , and was first applied to grbs by schmidt , higdon & hueter ( 1988 ) . for scintillation counter experiments , @xmath85 is the average of @xmath102 over all bursts , where @xmath103 is the peak counts ( in a set time interval ) and @xmath104 is the threshold for detection .",

    "1996 ) preliminary comparisons with batse , as in the bottom panel of figure [ fig - ang - hbm ] , will not lead us astray .",

    "note that the model curves for angular statistics in figure [ fig - ang - hbm ] implicitly assume a detector with uniform sky coverage ; i.e. , we have idealized that the detector is equally capable of detecting bursts from any location on the celestial sphere .",
    "we have corrected for the imperfect sky coverage of batse by shifting the _ data points _ in figure [ fig - ang - hbm ] appropriately ( see footnote 9 ) . in  [ sec - hbm - bat - pvo ]",
    "we will take the opposite approach : using the raw batse data and filtering the monte carlo model to take into account batse s imperfect sky coverage .    what can be learned from figure [ fig - ang - hbm ] ?",
    "beaming evidently increases @xmath85 to nearly 0.5 for nearby bursters , @xmath105 kpc .",

    "beaming also evidently reduces @xmath79 .",

    "note that the largest deviations from isotropy in figure [ fig - ang - hbm ] occur for bright ( i.e. , small-@xmath78 ) subsets of the observable bursts .",
    "a distinctive signature of the hbm is that @xmath84 is positive for bright bursts .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "the ( bright ) bursters which become visible at earth before reaching the remote galactic halo are the ones which happen to be born with beaming axis @xmath37 ( and hence , with @xmath61 ) pointed approximately toward or away from earth ( to within @xmath108 ) .",
    "because most bursters are born within the solar circle in the galactic disk , the brightest ones tend to be seen in that direction and toward the galactic anticenter , if they have already moved past the earth on their way out of the galaxy .",

    "podsiadlowski , rees and ruderman ( 1995 ) have emphasized the important point that these _ weakly - bound bursters do not return to the small galactic radii at which they were born _ because the gravitational potential in the halo is probably markedly non - spherical .",
    "large deviations from spherical symmetry are predicted by almost all models of galactic halo formation ( e.g. , dubinski 1992 and references therein ) .",
    "thus weakly - bound bursters ( i.e. , bursters born with velocities narrowly below the local galactic escape velocity ) will tend to stay in the outer halo , following wide - ranging , non - periodic orbits .",
    "after one or more orbits , their magnetic axi orientations are randomized .",
    "if these weakly - bound bursters continue to emit ( beamed ) bursts , their contribution to observed grbs must be added to the bursts from the escaping ones ( i.e. , the unbound  standard hbm \" sources , studied in  3 and  4 ) .",

    "this is a crude way to estimate the effects of a realistic ( gaussian ) velocity distribution . if the total birthrate of grb sources in the galaxy is @xmath280 yr@xmath6 ( eqn .",

    "probably a bound pair of m5 supergiant stars which is heavily reddened by interstellar dust , has been suggested as a counterpart object to sgr 1900@xmath4314 ( vrba et al .",
    "this object lies @xmath335 from the center of the observed x - ray image ( hurley et al .",
    "1996 ) and @xmath336 from the burst error box ( vrba et al .  1996 ) in a region of dense galactic starfields , so the identification is not certain . if the infrared binary is a true counterpart to the sgr , then the association of the sgr with the supernova remnant is almost certainly spurious , because no known process could impart a recoil of magnitude ( a2 ) to a pair of m5 supergiant stars .",
    "however , the other sgrs are unambiguously associated with @xmath337year  old snrs .",
    "thus we favor the interpretation that the infrared binary is not physically associated , and the snr is . in this case ,",
    "sgr 1900@xmath4314 closely resembles sgr 052666 in all its known ( observed ) properties .",
    "this burster is located within the @xmath10year - old snr g10.00.3 ( kulkarini et al .",
    "it also has an x - ray counterpart ( murakami et al .",
    "1994 ) which is point - like , but with a measured _ non - thermal _ spectral component ( sonobe et al .",
    "1994 ) , unlike the other sgrs .",
    "furthermore , there is a synchrotron radio plerion surrounding the sgr ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1994 ) indicating that the burster drives an outflow of relativistic particles .",
    "the radio spectral index of the plerion is steeper than that of known rotation - powered pulsar plerions ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1994 ) .    in the magnetar model , this plerion could be powered by sgr bursts , as suggested by kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and studied by tavani ( 1994 ) and harding ( 1996 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the radio nebula and non - thermal x - rays are powered by quasi - continuous low - amplitude alfvn wave emissions from magnetically - induced deep crustal fractures ( td95 ) .",
    "we favor this second interpretation , for reasons explained in td96 .",
    "the other sgrs do not power radio plerions ; this might mean that the deep crustal field in other sgrs is strong enough to overwhelm lattice stresses , driving plastic creep rather than quasi - steady low - amplitude seismic activity ( td96 ) .",
    "thus in our favored interpretation , sgr 180620 has the _ weakest _ magnetic flux density in the deep crust of known sgrs .",
    "alternatively , it could have the most spatially disordered magnetic field in the deep crust , which would also drive a higher rate of crustal fractures . in either case",
    ", we would expect it to also have the lowest recoil velocity according to the mechanisms of  2.4 .",
    "the displacement of sgr 180620 from the center of the snr is difficult to estimate because of the irregular shape of the remnant and because of late energy injection into the plerion , but kulkarni et al .",
    "( 1994 ) roughly estimate @xmath338 km s@xmath6 .",
    "this velocity is small enough , and uncertain enough , that the burster could have remained bound to a companion if it formed in a tight and massive binary .",
    "in fact , a massive companion star _",
    "has _ been detected ( kulkarni et al .",
    "it seems to be a heavily  reddened ob supergiant ( kerkwijk et al .",
    "its physical association with the sgr is in little doubt since it coincides with the finely - measured vla position of the plerion s central peak ( vasisht , frail & kulkarni 1995 ) .    since 180620 is the only sgr with a confirmed companion _ and _ a radio plerion , it is tempting to speculate that the two phenomena are related , and that the plerion is accretion  driven .",
    "however , sgr 180620 has few properties in common with known accretion ",
    "powered radio nebulae ( vasisht , frail & kulkarni 1995 ) .",
    "moreover , the x - ray power is much less than the required power in relativistic particles ( td96 ) .",
    "accretion  powered outflows from neutron stars ( e.g. , jets ) can have only a modest outflow efficiency , so the ratio would be the other way around ( td95 ; td96 ) . still , one should keep in mind that sgr 180620 is much more complex than the other two sgrs .",
    "it is possible that interaction with , or accretion from , its hot supergiant companion may play some role in this system , even if the sgr is a magnetar .",
    "more observations are needed .",
    "if classic grbs are produced by old halo sgrs , then bursters which remain in binaries , like sgr 180620 , are constrained to _ not _ produce too many observable classic grbs as they grow old .",
    "if they did , the concentration of grbs toward the galactic plane could violate batse limits .",
    "in the hbm , this requirement is actually not very restrictive , because bursters in binaries have effectively random beaming directions , greatly reducing their observable burst rates compared to bursters which become unbound .",
    "furthermore , grbs from old sgrs in binaries might be suppressed by the environmental influences of their companions , or because values of @xmath51 that are sufficiently small to avoid binary disruption only occur  via the mechanism of ",
    "2.4in stars with systematically weaker and/or more disordered magnetic fields , which penetrate the neutron star core less deeply .",
    "such stars would be expected to dissipate their smaller resevoirs of magnetic energy relatively quickly , showing less magnetic activity ( grbs ) late in their lives .",
    "the fact that the detectable energy loss from sgr 180620 exceeds that of the other sgrs is consistent with this conjecture .",
    "the amplitude @xmath339 of alfvn waves required to to carry a luminosity of @xmath340 erg s@xmath6 , as appropriate for halo grbs ( cf .",

    "these alfvn waves presumably couple to shear waves in the crust , which have velocity @xmath344 , where the shear modulus at density @xmath345 gm @xmath346 is @xmath347 erg @xmath346 , valid below neutron drip , @xmath348 .",
    "this value of @xmath349 comes from eq .  (",

    "this exceeds the dynamical yield ( fracturing ) strain for @xmath356 g.   thus _ waves with sufficient amplitude to mediate a halo grb would crumble a radiopulsar s crust and thereby dissipate energy , _ probably producing an excess of x - rays . only for fields that satisfy",
    "@xmath357 is the vibration amplitude small enough to avoid pulverizing the crust .",
    "this condition is numerically similar to the magnetic energy requirement of equation  ( [ eq - breq ] ) , but conceptually distinct .",
    "note that when equation ( [ eq - waveb ] ) is satisfied , there are actually four distinct physical domains for the propagation of waves in the crust :  * ( 1 ) *  @xmath358 gm @xmath346 . at this depth , the shear waves have amplitude that varies with density as @xmath359 , based on a power - law fit to the negele & vautherin ( 1973 ) equilibrium composition .",

    "linear alfvn waves in a neutron star magnetosphere are accompanied by oscillating currents , @xmath368 .",
    "if the ambient plasma density is so low that the drift velocities needed to sustain @xmath369 exceed @xmath370 , then the wave is _ charge - starved_. this occurs at plasma densities less than @xmath371 where @xmath372 hz is the wave frequency .",
    "[ note that bbgm predict a frequency spectrum peaked at @xmath373 hz for bursts triggered by crust fractures .",
    "this comes from the condition that @xmath374 be comparable to the shear wave crossing - time of the fracture . ]",
    "bbgm have speculated that charge - starved alfvn waves accelerate charges until they are limited by radiation losses , thus producing grbs as the waves undergo nonlinear damping .",
    "if this is true , then grb emission from ordinary radiopulsars might occur only after they cross the  death line \" at age @xmath375 yrs ( chen & ruderman 1993 ) , after which time the ambient plasma density in the magnetosphere is less than @xmath376 .",
    "this could produce a delayed turn - on of grbs from pulsars , as in the galactic halo model of li & dermer ( 1992 ) .",
    "however , the energy requirements for bursters ( eq .  [ [ eq - teng ] ] and eq .  [",
    "[ eq - breq ] ] ) , the crust  crumbling limit ( eq .  [ [ eq - waveb ] ] ) and the over - concentration of old pulsars to the galactic disk are all potential difficulties with this scenario ( ld92 ) .",
    "magnetars , which may avoid these drawbacks , cross the death line at @xmath377 yrs , comparable to the length of the sgr activity epoch .",
    "subsequently , there exists a co - rotation charge density in the magnetosphere of magnitude ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) @xmath378 where we have assumed a value of @xmath379 appropriate for spindown driven by a constant dipole field .",
    "comparison with eq .",
    "( [ eq - cstarve ] ) shows that , just after crossing the death line , alfvn waves carrying luminosities characteristic of halo grbs are _ not _ charge - starved near a magnetar s surface .",
