    "theorem [ thm : expononlocconn ] is related to the existence of so - called _ cantor bouquets _ within the bifurcation locus ; compare figure [ fig : bouquet ] .",
    "these consist of uncountably many curves ( on parameter rays ) that are locally modelled as a subset of the product of an interval and a cantor set .    ]",
    "local connectivity of the mandelbrot set would have a number of important consequences apart from that described by theorem [ thm : mlc_hd ] : for example , there are a number of topological models for @xmath21 ( such as douady s _ pinched disks _",
    "@xcite or thurston s _ quadratic minor lamination _",
    "@xcite ) that are homeomorphic to @xmath21 if and only if @xmath21 is locally connected .",
    "moreover , mlc is equivalent to the _ combinatorial rigidity conjecture _ : any two maps in @xmath20 without indifferent periodic orbits can be distinguished combinatorially ( in terms of which periodic dynamic rays land together ) .",

    "one fundamental difference between polynomial and exponential parameter space is that the escape locus @xmath24 is hyperbolic only in the polynomial case ; for exponential parameter space , separation lines are disjoint from @xmath24 and thus from parameter rays ( an alternative definition of separation lines uses parameter rays ; see below ) .",
    "if @xmath2 is a hyperbolic parameter , then it follows easily from the definition that the fiber of @xmath2 is trivial .",

    "triviality of the fiber of a parameter @xmath2 in the quadratic bifurcation locus implies local connectivity of the mandelbrot set at @xmath2 . in fact , all known proofs of local connectivity of @xmath21 at given parameters do so by actually establishing triviality of fibers .",

    "in this context , there is a difference between the situation for the mandelbrot set and that of exponential parameter space . in the former case",
    ", triviality of the fiber of @xmath2 implies that _ all _ parameter rays accumulating on @xmath2 land . in the latter case",
    ", we can only conclude that _",
    "one _ of these rays lands .",
    "the problem is that escaping parameters are contained in the bifurcation locus ; it is compatible with our current knowledge that one parameter ray might accumulate on another ray together with its landing point ( compare figure [ fig : accumulation ] ) , in which case the corresponding fiber could still be trivial .",
    "this might lead us to formulate a stronger variant of conjecture [ conj : fiberstrivial ] : _ all fibers are trivial , and furthermore all parameter rays land_. it seems plausible that these conjectures are equivalent ( we believe that both are true ) .",
    "we defined separation lines as curves through hyperbolic components .",
    "we did so since this gives a simple definition and does not require the landing of periodic parameter rays in the exponential family ( a fact that was proved in @xcite , which is however not formally published ) .",
    "there are a number of other definitions we could have chosen ; for example ,    1 .",
    "a _ separation line _ is a curve consisting either of two parameter rays landing at a common parabolic parameter , or of two parameter rays landing at distinct parabolic parameters , together with a curve which connects these two landing points within a single hyperbolic component .",
    "[ item : separationparabolic ] 2 .",

    "3 .   a _ separation line _ is a jordan arc , tending to infinity in both directions , containing only finitely many parameters which are not escaping or hyperbolic .",
    "these alternative definitions will yield a theory of fibers for which all of the above results remain true .",
    "however , it is a priori conceivable that separation lines run through parameters with nontrivial fibers , in which case the fiber of a nearby parameter @xmath70 may depend on the definition of separation lines is ( b ) , which is shown to be equivalent to ( a ) ; for @xmath21 , all parabolic parameters have trivial fibers . ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the question of _ triviality _ of such a fiber , and hence conjecture [ conj : fiberstrivial ] , is independent of this definition .",
    "we begin by showing that the exponential bifurcation locus is not locally connected .      _",
    "( exponential bifurcation locus not locally connected . ) _ as already remarked , failure of local connectivity in the exponential setting follows already from devaney s proof of structural instability of @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "essentially , he showed that the interval @xmath73 is accumulated on by curves in hyperbolic components ( compare figure [ fig : approxreal ] ) .",
    "we will now indicate how to prove failure of local connectivity at every point of @xmath41 using a similar idea , together with more detailed knowledge of exponential parameter space .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath74 be a parameter ray in exponential parameter space .",
