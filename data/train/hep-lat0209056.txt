    "lattice calculation of phase shifts is an important step for understanding of strong interactions beyond the hadron mass spectrum . for scattering lengths which are the threshold values of phase shifts ,",
    "there are already several studies in literature . for the @xmath0 @xmath2 scattering calculations",
    "have been carried out with the staggered  @xcite , the standard  @xcite and the improved wilson fermion actions  @xcite .",
    "recent studies by jlqcd  @xcite and by liu _ et.al .",
    "_  @xcite carried out the calculation at several lattice cutoffs and obtained the scattering length in the continuum limit . for the scattering phase shift , in contrast",
    ", there is only one calculation for @xmath0 , which used lattice data to estimate an effective @xmath2 potential and a quantum mechanical analysis to calculate the phase shift from the potential  @xcite .",
    "we present a lattice qcd calculation of the @xmath0 @xmath1-wave @xmath2 phase shift using the finite - size method  @xcite .",
    "we work in quenched lattice qcd employing the standard plaquette action for gluons at @xmath9 and the wilson fermion action for quarks .",
    "the number of configurations ( lattice sizes ) are @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) , and @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "quark propagators are solved with the dirichlet boundary condition imposed in the time direction and the periodic boundary condition in the space directions .",
    "quark masses are chosen to be the same as in the previous study of quenched hadron spectroscopy by cp - pacs  @xcite ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath16 ) for all lattice sizes .",
    "preliminary results of the present work was presented at lattice01  @xcite .",
    "the energy eigenvalue @xmath17 of an @xmath1-wave @xmath2 system with momentum @xmath18 and @xmath19 in a finite periodic box of a size @xmath20 is shifted from twice the pion energy @xmath21 by finite - size effects .",
    "lscher derived a relation between the energy shift @xmath22 and the scattering phase shift @xmath23 , which takes the form @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 , ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are geometrical constants .",
    "the scattering length is given by @xmath31 .    in order to obtain the energy eigenvalue",
    "@xmath17 we construct @xmath2 4-point functions @xmath32 . here",
    "@xmath33 is an interpolating field for the @xmath1-wave @xmath2 system at time @xmath34 given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an element of the cubic group . in numerical calculations",
    "we construct the source operator @xmath37 using the noisy source method with u(1 ) random numbers .",
    "= 7.0 cm    since the @xmath38-point function @xmath39 contains many exponential terms as pointed out by maiani and testa  @xcite , the extraction of energy eigenvalues from @xmath39 is non - trivial .",
    "we solve this problem by the method proposed by lscher and wolf  @xcite . in their method , one diagonalize the @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath42 @xmath43_{pk}$ ] at each @xmath34 where @xmath44 is fixed at some small value .",
    "the eigenvalues are given by @xmath45 .",
    "in the actual diagonalization we have to cut off the set of momenta . here",
    "we expect that the components of @xmath39 or @xmath46 for @xmath47 are dominant for the eigenvalue @xmath48 in the large @xmath34 region , while the components @xmath49 are less important .    with this expectation ,",
    "we calculate the energy eigenvalue for the ground state ( @xmath50 ) and the first excited state ( @xmath51 ) for @xmath52 , and also that of the second excited state ( @xmath53 ) for @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the cut - off dependence is investigated by varying the number of momenta @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "in order to examine the effects of diagonalization , we calculate two ratios defined by @xmath58 ^ 2 $ ] and @xmath59 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath60 is the pion propagator with momentum @xmath61 . if @xmath62 or @xmath63 behaves as a single exponential function , we can obtain the energy shift @xmath64 from the ratio @xmath65 or @xmath66 by a single exponential fit .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1.fig ] we compare the ratios for @xmath67 .",
    "the two - pion source is placed at @xmath68 .",
    "the momentum cut - off is set at @xmath69 .",
    "the signals are very clear and diagonalizations do not affect the result .",
    "we checked the cut - off dependence by taking @xmath70 and confirmed that it is negligible . in previous calculations of scattering",
    "lengths@xcite the ratio @xmath71 was used to extract the energy shift @xmath72 .",
    "our calculation demonstrates the reliability of these calculations .",
    "we compare the ratios for @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig2.fig ] . the momentum cutoff is set at @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath67 case , the diagonalization is very effective .",
    "we can observe a convincing single exponential behavior only after the diagonalization .",
    "the cut - off dependence is negligible .        in fig .",
    "[ fig3.fig ] we plot our results for the scattering amplitude @xmath76 at @xmath77 and @xmath78 obtained by substituting our data for @xmath64 into ( [ lusher.eq ] ) .",
    "in order to obtain the phase shift for various momenta at the physical pion mass , we extrapolate our data with the following fitting assumption : @xmath79 .",
    "the fit curves are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig3.fig ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4.fig ] we compare the calculated phase shift @xmath23 at physical pion mass with the fit above with experiments  @xcite .",
    "our results for @xmath80 are 30% smaller in magnitude than those of experiments , and our result for scattering length , @xmath81 , differs from the chpt prediction given by @xmath82  @xcite , but consistent with the result of jlqcd at the same lattice spacing , @xmath83  @xcite .",
    "a possible cause of the discrepancy is finite lattice spacing effects .",
    "the jlqcd results for scattering length show sizable scaling violation  @xcite .",
    "hence that of the scattering phase shift can not be considered small .",
    "further calculations nearer to the continuum limit or calculations with improved actions are desirable .",
