    "the contribution of the compact dimensions ( @xmath218 ) to the force resemble the one in universal extra dimensions ( ued ) , not surprisingly , as they enter into the dispersion relation in the same way . whereas a full expression for the casimir force for an arbitrary number of universal extra dimensions does not exist in the literature , our 6d result is the same as in @xcite in the limit @xmath219 .",
    "we note that our force expression for @xmath0d naturally recovers the @xmath0-dimensional generalization of 5d ued as @xmath220 .",
    "the difference between the casimir force in rsi and rsii models rests in the appearance of the bessel function terms , which are the contribution from the discrete kk spectrum , absent in rsii due to the lack of the second boundary condition .",
    "the casimir force was calculated for rsii model in both 6d and @xmath0d case in @xcite and in @xcite , respectively , using the green s function method .",
    "we find it rather difficult to compare our results to theirs , as they do not present an expression for the force in terms of analytic functions . in the 6d analysis",

    "we analyzed ( [ m8.6 ] ) more systematically using an analytical approach .",
    "this method is also helpful when estimating what one would expect numerically by adding more extra dimensions .",
    "we first tried to understand why effects appear from rs at around @xmath230 .",
    "we concentrate on the term with the modified bessel function @xmath231 ( a similar analysis will hold for the @xmath232 term as well):@xmath233 the dominant contributions come when the argument of @xmath231 is small , thus the first few terms of series are dominant .",
    "in addition , as @xmath234 gets smaller and smaller , it increases the argument of @xmath231 ( for non - zero @xmath235 of course , ) and no matter how small @xmath209 is , there is no contribution from terms with bessel functions .",
    "thus , the @xmath236 term in the series is dominant . for simplicity ,",
    "take @xmath237 and call the argument of @xmath231 as @xmath238 .",
    "then , the dominant term is @xmath239 .",
    "the limiting form of @xmath240 is , for @xmath241 @xmath242 the condition on @xmath243 gives a critical value where the bessel terms start being sizable .",
    "for example , for @xmath244 m and @xmath225 gev , the critical value of @xmath228 becomes @xmath245 . at any value greater than this critical value",
    ", @xmath209 becomes exponentially smaller and the bessel terms completely dominate contributions from the other terms .",
    "this is exactly the effect seen in fig .",
    "[ 6d ] . the same analysis for the @xmath232 term gives 21.068 for the critical value of @xmath228 .",
    "the limiting form of the @xmath232 and @xmath231 terms , including the factors in front ( but not the sign ) becomes @xmath246 and @xmath247 , respectively .",
    "we need to emphasize another feature . like the casimir force in 4d",
    ", the force in 6d vanishes as the plate separation increases .",
    "the @xmath248 term in ( [ m8.6 ] ) is independent of @xmath96 and blows up as @xmath234 decreases . to see that the force in 6d behaves like @xmath249 for very small @xmath234 values ,",
    "consider the epstein zeta function @xmath250 term in ( [ m8.6 ] ) .",
    "one can expand @xmath250 as , defining @xmath251 , @xmath252 where @xmath253 in our case , @xmath254 and @xmath255 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath256 if @xmath234 is small for a fixed @xmath96 , we have @xmath257 and @xmath258 goes to @xmath259 which exactly cancels the other @xmath248 term in ( [ m8.6 ] ) .",
    "we are left with the @xmath260 term which is very close to the 4d force term .",
    "note that @xmath261 also vanishes as @xmath262 increases .",
    "for example , the force in 6d becomes , as @xmath257 @xmath263\\ ] ] where the second term vanishes in this limit .",
    "this analysis can be generalized to the @xmath0d case and it can be showed that the same type of cancellations hold .",
    "numerically , for small @xmath234 values , we need the precise cancellation of very large numbers which require high numerical precision in the calculation .     for @xmath264 and @xmath265 with @xmath225 gev and @xmath266 .",
    "here @xmath267 is assumed .",
    "the shaded region represents @xmath268 error for the measurement of plate separation @xmath96.,width=480 ]    -0.2 in    as can be seen from the above discussion , adding more compact dimensions would not affect much the @xmath228 dependence of the force .",
    "extra dimensions bring an extra suppression factor for the bessel terms ( when @xmath269 and @xmath209 are comparable ) but these effects will be minor for most cases",
    ". the force will feel the effect of extra @xmath234 s in @xmath0d coming from the terms other than the bessel functions .",
    "as @xmath228 is not affeted , in this limit the force is identical to that in ued in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "there exist some studies in the literature @xcite as well as some debate on whether the force is attractive or repulsive in extra universal dimensions @xcite .",
    "as shown in previous sections , the 5d form of our force in @xmath220 limit is identical to the 5d result of @xcite in ued and the force is always attractive . in fig .",
    "[ 7d ] we display the force in both 6d and 7d as a function of @xmath96 for two values of @xmath234 , @xmath270 m and @xmath271 m . here",
    "we assume @xmath267 .",
    "we chose @xmath266 , where there is practically no rs contribution from the bessel terms so we can maximize the effects from extra compact dimensions .",
    "this can be considered like 6d ued in this limit . as in 5d ued ,",
    "the force remains negative in 6d as well , thanks to the precise cancellation of @xmath96-independent @xmath272 terms ( or @xmath273 terms in general ) with the ones from the @xmath78 term ( similarly between @xmath274 and @xmath78 terms as well ) , as discussed above in 6d rsi . in 5d ued ,",
    "the bound from casimir force on @xmath234 is very weak ( about @xmath275 m ) @xcite but adding more compact dimensions , as seen from fig .",
    "[ 7d ] , will strengthen the bound .",
    "conversely , if the limit on the size of extra dimensions is held constant , their number will be restricted . however ,",
    "unless one introduces a large number of compact dimensions , it would be unrealistic from casimir force considerations to get bounds on the size or number of extra dimensions as strong as the ones from @xmath276 , for example @xcite , which requires @xmath234 to be less than @xmath277 m in 5d ued .",
    "we calculate , using dimensional regularization , the casimir force between two parallel plates in randall sundrum models with extra compact dimensions . we include both the one brane scenario ( referred to as rsii ) and the two brane scenario ( rsi ) .",
    "we present explicit analytic expressions for the energy between the plates , the renormalized energy , and finally for the casimir force for the cases of one extra compact dimension ( 6d ) , and finally @xmath0 extra compact dimensions ( @xmath0d ) in each model .",
    "we show consistency of the expressions both from @xmath0d to 6d and 5d models ( rs models with no compact dimensions ) .",
    "we also show that in the limit in which the non - compact dimension of randall sundrum models becomes irrelevant , our expressions reproduce exactly the known ued expression in one extra dimension . in that limit",
    ", our results present the generalization of the casimir energy in @xmath0 universal extra dimensions , and we settle the controversy regarding the sign of the force . we also compare our results with a calculation in rsii models in 6d and @xmath0d and briefly discuss the discrepancies .    for the rsii model , comparison with the known casimir force in 4d yields ( as in 5d ) negligible corrections , making this model not as interesting phenomenologically as rsi . in rsi",
    ", we perform an analytical and numerical analysis of our results and discuss the effects of extra compact dimensions on the size of @xmath228 , the relevant parameter for rsi models , as well as the consequences of the rs models on the size of the compact ( ued like ) dimensions .",
    "finally , we analyze the effects of having additional compact dimensions .",
    "although the bounds on the size of the compact dimensions obtained are not as strong as those coming from other low energy experimental restrictions , our results include a comprehensive range of numerical and analytical explorations of the casimir force in extra dimensions , and we are consistent with previous calculations in both rs and ued models in the relevant limits .",
