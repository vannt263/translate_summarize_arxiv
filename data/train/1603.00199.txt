    "pre - planetary nebulae ( ppne ) are transient objects between the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase and the planetary nebula ( pn ) phase in the evolution of low- to intermediate - mass stars . in less than a thousand years , ppne will transform into pne when the central stars evolve to hot white dwarfs and photoionize their envelopes .",
    "most ppne are aspherical and found to possess bipolar or multipolar lobes @xcite with kinematic ages less than 1000 yr @xcite .",
    "bipolar lobes can be produced by fast winds ejected from around central stars near the end of the agb phase .",
    "however , multipolar ppne may not be produced in the same way , because the fast winds , even if precessing , have difficulty producing the multipolar morphology .",
    "crl 618 is one of the most well - studied multipolar ppne , and thus a good candidate for our study of the mass - loss process in multipolar ppne . in the @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 ( @xmath6 )",
    "images , multipolar optical lobes were observed in the east - west direction @xcite .",
    "these optical lobes are expanding rapidly away from the center @xcite .",
    "infrared observations in h@xmath7 @xcite , and ( sub)millimeter observations in co @xmath81 @xcite , @xmath22 @xcite , and @xmath95 @xcite revealed fast molecular outflows along the optical lobes . a dense core was detected around the central star @xcite surrounded by a tenuous spherical halo @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional hydrodynamical simulations have attempted to reproduce the lobe morphology of crl 618 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite used a collimated fast wind ( cfw ) model to produce one of the well - defined lobes in the west by using the zeus-2d hydrodynamics code . in the cfw model ,",
    "the ppn lobes are a result from the interaction of the fast winds with the surrounding agb halo .",
    "the cfw can reproduce the structures and kinematics of the outflow lobe .",
    "however , the cfw may need to be more confined like a cylindrical jet in order to produce enough shock emission .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite showed that a massive clump ( bullet ) model can also produce the structure and kinematics of a lobe in crl 618 .",
    "recently , @xcite measured proper motions of the optical lobes and found that the fingertips of the lobes have the same expansion ages of @xmath0 100@xmath1015 yr .",
    "therefore , these optical lobes likely all resulted from a spray of bullets in different directions . as a result , @xcite followed up with the bullet model and included the periodical density enhancement in the agb halo in order to produce the observed ringlike structures in the lobe .",
    "later , the fast molecular outflows at the tips of the optical lobes are also found to have similar expansion ages to the optical lobes @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the optical lobes and the fast molecular outflows likely all resulted from the same spray of bullets .",
    "additional fast molecular outflows are found near the source along the outflow axes with ages of @xmath0 45@xmath1025 yr , suggesting a second episode of bullet ejections .",
    "but the origin of the bullets is still unknown .",
    "the bullet ejections could be due to magneto - rotational explosions @xcite or nova - like explosions @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite adopted a precessing jet model @xcite to reproduce the multipolar morphology of crl 618 .",
    "if the jet source is also pulsing and the precession period is an integer multiple of the pulsing period , the jet can produce multiple lobes . but this model can only produce point - symmetric lobes . in order to reproduce the asymmetric lobes as seen in crl 618 , a complicated  asymmetrical jet ejection mechanism \" @xcite",
    "is required @xcite .    in this paper , in order to understand the formation of the multipolar structures of crl 618 , we perform 3d simulations using a multi - directional bullet model .",
    "unlike previous bullet models , our agb halo has parameters close to those derived from the observations of crl 618 .",
    "in addition , a dense core around the center is also included , as in the observations .",
    "the inclusion of the dense core is important to derive the masses of the bullets accurately , because the resulting velocity of the bullets depends on the interactions of the bullets with the dense core .",
    "for the first attempt , we only model the lobes in the east of crl 618 .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , two episodes of bullet ejections are assumed , first with two bullets to produce the two major lobes , and second with three bullets to produce the fast molecular outflows near the source .",
    "the numerical settings and assumptions are given in section 2 ; we compare the 3d simulations and simulated co intensity maps with observations in section 3 ; in section 4 we discuss the results and possible origin of bullets ; and we summarize this work in section 5 .",
    "we perform the simulations of the bullet model using the zeus-3d code , which is a grid - based computational fluid dynamics code @xcite .",
    "the code has been expanded to include molecular and atomic cooling by @xcite .",
    "in addition , molecular chemistry is also included to calculate the fraction of molecular hydrogen and atomic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "the material is assumed to consist of mostly molecular hydrogen .",
    "helium is also included with the number density @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the number density of the hydrogen nuclei .",
    "the co - to - h@xmath7 relative abundance is assumed to be 2@xmath1310@xmath14 , as adopted in @xcite .    in our simulations ,",

    "the @xmath15-axis is the polar axis .",
    "the @xmath16- and @xmath17-axes are in the equatorial plane , perpendicular to the polar axis .",
    "we use 576@xmath13400@xmath13400 cells with a resolution of 12.5 au per cell to cover from 0 to 7200 au in the @xmath15-axis , @xmath182500 to 2500 au in the @xmath16-axis , and @xmath182500 to 2500 au in the @xmath17-axis .",

    "a number of bullets are ejected from the central source , interacting with the surrounding to produce the multipolar lobes .",
    "the surrounding consists of an agb halo with a dense core at the center .",
    "figure [ f1]a shows the optical lobes of crl 618 in the h@xmath20 image , taken by the @xmath6 in 2009 august .",
    "the outflow lobes labeled with e1 , e2 and e3 are clearly detected in optical .",
    "the labels e4 and e5 indicate the positions of the two molecular outflow lobes detected in the high - velocity co emission map @xcite , as shown in figure [ f1]b . in our models ,",
    "bullets are used to produce the optical lobes and the fast molecular outflows along the lobes . according to the observations @xcite",
    ", there would be two episodes of bullet ejections . in model 1 ,",
    "two bullets ( bullets 1 and 2 ) are ejected from the central source in the first episode at a simulation time of @xmath0 90 yr ago in order to produce the two major lobes , e1 and e2 , in the east of crl 618 . in order to avoid the collision between the two bullets ,",
    "the second bullet is ejected 6 yr after the first bullet . in model 2 , we add a second episode of three bullets ( bullets 3 , 4 , and 5 ) at @xmath0 40 yr after the first episode , in order to produce the additional fast outflows ( lobes e3 , e4 , and e5 ) near the source in the east of crl 618 . again , in order to avoid the collision between the bullets , we assume that bullets 3 , 4 , and 5 are ejected one by one with a time delay of 6 yr . notice that lobe e3 was assumed to have a similar dynamical age to lobes e1 and e2 in @xcite .",
    "here it is assumed to have a similar dynamical age to lobes e4 and e5 , as in @xcite .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because lobe e3 has a similar length and radial velocity to lobe e5 .",
    "all the bullets are assumed to be ejected from the center .",
    "they are cylindrical with a diameter @xmath21 au and a length @xmath22 au . in the observations of crl 618 by @xcite , most of the gas in the fast outflows are at temperatures of @xmath0 200 k. therefore , we set the temperature of the bullets to 200 k.    the ejection velocities of the bullets in crl 618 are unknown , but their lower limits can be estimated from the transverse velocities ( proper motions ) of the optical lobes , @xmath23 @xcite and the radial velocities of the fast outflows , @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "table  [ tbl-1 ] shows the lower limits calculated with @xmath25 .",
    "the ejection velocities @xmath26 must be higher than the lower limits but not by much , because the bullets are much denser than the surrounding . therefore , in our simulations , we set the ejection velocities to be slightly higher .",
    "as shown in table [ tbl-2 ] , the ejection velocities @xmath26 are 330 and 350 km s@xmath27 for bullets 1 and 2 , 280 km s@xmath27 for bullet 3 , and 240 km",
    "s@xmath27 for bullets 4 and 5 .",
    "the ejection orientation of the bullets is defined by the position angle , @xmath28 , and the inclination angle , @xmath29/@xmath30 , of the outflow axis of the optical lobes and fast outflows , as listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "for example , we assume bullet 1 to be ejected along the outflow axis of lobe e1 which has @xmath31 90  and @xmath32 @xmath1824  ( fig . [ f2 ] ) .",
    "this axis is also set to be the @xmath15-axis in our simulations .",
    "since no fast outflow was observed at the tip of lobe e2 , the inclination angle of lobe e2 can not be determined .",
    "lobe e2 is assumed to have @xmath33 @xmath1832 , lying slightly in front of lobe e1 .",
    "the inclination angle of lobes e4 and e5 are set to @xmath1835  and @xmath1845 , similar to the observed values . for lobe e3 ,",
    "the transverse velocity and thus the inclination angle are uncertain .",
    "we set @xmath3445 for this lobe , like lobe e5 .",
    "the bullet mass is set to @xmath0 0.011 m@xmath1 for bullets 1 and 2 , and 0.004 m@xmath1 for bullets 3 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "the total mass of the bullets is therefore @xmath0 0.034 m@xmath1 .",
    "this value is about half of the total mass ( 0.065 m@xmath1 ) estimated from the total flux of the fast molecular outflows in the east and west of crl 618 ( with @xmath35 km s@xmath27 , * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , this value is consistent with the observations .",
    "the density of the bullets is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the diameter , length , and mass of the bullets .",
    "as mentioned earlier , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are both 200 au .",
    "therefore , the density of the bullets is @xmath0 ( 0.41.0 ) @xmath40 g @xmath41 , and thus the number density of hydrogen nuclei in the bullets is @xmath42 ( 1.64.4)@xmath43 @xmath41 ( table  [ tbl-2 ] ) .    in our model ,",
    "the densities of the bullets are higher than those adopted in the previous simulations : @xcite adopted a number density of @xmath44 @xmath41 for the bullet in their model .",
    "unlike their model , there is a dense core present in our model . @xcite and @xcite adopted an average density of @xmath45 @xmath41 for the jet in their precessing jet model . in their model , a dense core",
    "is included , with a density of @xmath46 @xmath41 near the source . in our model",
    ", the dense core has a density of @xmath47 @xmath41 near the source ( as described in the next section ) , which is @xmath0 2 orders of magnitude higher than that in their precessing jet model .",
    "thus , higher - density bullets are needed to excavate the holes in the dense core . as discussed earlier ,",
    "the total mass of the bullets is 0.034 m@xmath1 , still consistent with the submillimeter observations .",
    "the mass - loss rate is given by @xmath48 which is @xmath49 m@xmath1 yr@xmath27 for bullets 1 and 2 , and @xmath50 m@xmath1 yr@xmath27 for bullets 3 , 4 , and 5 .",
    "the agb halo is assumed to be spherical symmetric with a constant mass - loss rate .",
    "thus , the density of the agb halo is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mass - loss rate assumed to be @xmath0 5.5@xmath53 m@xmath1 yr@xmath27 ( derived from the number density of molecular hydrogen in table 1 in * ? ? ?",

    "here we set the temperature of the agb halo to be 10 k. these two settings of the agb halo will not affect the dynamics of the outflow lobes to be produced .",
    "the outer part of the dense core has been detected in crl 618 with a radius of @xmath0 1100 au @xcite .",
    "however , the actual radius of the dense core should be larger .",
    "thus , in our simulations , the radius of the dense core @xmath56 is assumed to be 1500 au .",
    "the density distribution is assumed to be toroidal instead of spherical ( fig .",
    "[ f3 ] ) because the dense core seems to be the inner part of the expanding torus detected in the equatorial plane extending to 5000 au from the center @xcite .",
    "for a toroidal density distribution , the simple form can be written as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the angle measured from the polar axis , a is the isotropic parameter , and b is the toroidal parameter .",

    "the slope of the pv structure is roughly equal to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the projected distance from the center , and @xmath78 is the time after ejection .",
    "therefore , different slopes are seen for the outflows in different ejection episodes .",
    "notice that since no molecular emission is detected for lobe e2 , no pv structure is detected for lobe e2 in the observation , as shown in figure [ f7]b .",
    "in order to test our bullet models realistically , the physical parameters of the dense core are set to be close to those derived from the observations .",

    ", we also include the dense core detected recently in crl 618 @xcite and set the physical parameters of our bullets using the fast molecular outflows recently detected in @xcite .",
    "as discussed earlier , our model can reproduce the morphology and the kinematics of the multipolar lobes in the east of crl 618 reasonably well .",
    "since the lobes in the west are different from those in the east , a different set of bullets are needed to produce them .",
    "notice that two episodes of bullet ejections are assumed in our model , based on the observations of fast molecular outflows in @xcite .",
    "however , since all the optical lobes were found to have similar dynamical ages @xcite , the bullets could also be ejected at the same time .",
    "further observations are needed to determine this .",
    "although both of the precessing jet model and our multi - directional bullet model can produce the multiple lobes , there is an observational difference for the shock structures at the tips of the lobes between the two models .",
    "as seen in figure 4 of @xcite , the synthetic image shows that the shapes of the shocks produced by precessing jets are blunt ( u - shaped ) . in our bullet model , on the other hand , the shapes at the tips of the lobes are sharp ( v - shaped ) . in the observations of crl 618 , the shapes of the shocks are as sharp as those seen in our simulations .",
    "the origin of the bullets is still uncertain .",
    "@xcite argued that the bullets may be driven by an explosive magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) mechanism ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "near the end of the agb phase , the central star rotates very fast so that the magnetic field can be highly twisted near the central star .",
    "if the magnetic field is strong enough , the magnetic pressure force can drive a magneto - rotational explosion .",
    "such an explosion event could produce multiple bullets simultaneously , producing the multipolar lobes of crl 618 .",
    "further study is needed to determine if this kind of explosion can occur twice , as needed in our simulations .",
    "interestingly , extremely low isotope ratios of @xmath84c/@xmath85c ( @xmath0 10 ) and @xmath86n/@xmath87n ( tentatively found to be @xmath0 150 ) were found in the dense core at the center @xcite .",
    "these low isotope ratios are unexpected to be seen in a c - rich dense core @xcite , such as that in crl 618 .",
    "as suggested in @xcite , these low ratios could be due to a hot cno cycle as in a nova - like explosion .",
    "if this is the case , then the bullets could be ejected by these explosions .",
    "theoretically , a nova requires a close binary system with the secondary being a white dwarf , and it is triggered by the accretion of hydrogen gas from the primary onto the white dwarf .",
    "the hydrogen gas can be pulled onto the surface of the white dwarf and then form an envelope massive enough to ignite the hot cno cycles .",
    "if this is the case in crl 618 , then the center would be a binary system .",
    "this binary system in turn could produce the flattened common envelope around the center , seen as the expanding torus .    in our model",
    ", there are two episodes of bullet ejections .",
    "the first episode occurred about 90 yr ago , and the second episode occurred about 50 yr ago .",
    "interestingly , by studying the hii region at the center , @xcite found that crl 618 turned from a ppn into a pn at the center about 50 yr ago .",
    "thus , it is possible that the second episode of bullet ejection is related to the formation of the hii region at the center and thus the evolutionary phase change of the central star .",
    "with hydrodynamical simulations , we have studied the shaping mechanism of the multipolar ppn crl 618 using a multi - directional bullet model . in our simulations , we include a spherical agb halo with a mass - loss rate of @xmath0 @xmath88 m@xmath1 yr@xmath27 and a toroidal dense core with a mean mass - loss rate of @xmath0 @xmath79 m@xmath1 yr@xmath27 , as found in previous observations .",
    "also , based on previous observations of fast molecular outflows in the east of the central source , we assume two episodes of bullet ejection , with the first at @xmath0 90 yr ago and the second at @xmath0 50 yr ago , and with a total mass of @xmath0 0.034 m@xmath1 .    we find that our simulations can reproduce the morphology of the multipolar lobes in the east of crl 618 .",

    "however , in order to produce the observed emission extending from @xmath0 to , the agb halo might need to be denser than that assumed here . at high velocity",
    ", the emission is distributed at the tips of all the lobes .",
    "the velocity increases with the distance , similar to that seen in the observation .",
    "since the intensity is about half of that observed , more massive bullets might be needed .",
    "the origin of the bullets is unknown .",
    "the ejection of these bullets could be due to magneto - rotational explosions or nova - like explosions around a binary companion .",
    "interestingly , the more recent ejection at about 50 yr ago could be related to the formation of the hii region at the center when crl 618 turned from a ppn into a pn .",

    "<S> in order to understand the formation of the multipolar structures of the pre - planetary nebula ( ppn ) crl 618 , we perform 3d simulations using a multi - directional bullet model . the optical lobes of crl 618 and fast molecular outflows at the tips of the lobes have been found to have similar expansion ages of @xmath0 100 yr . </S>",
    "<S> additional fast molecular outflows were found near the source along the outflow axes with ages of @xmath0 45 yr , suggesting a second episode of bullet ejections . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in our simulations , two episodes of bullet ejections are assumed . </S>",
    "<S> the shaping process is simulated using the zeus-3d hydrodynamics code that includes molecular and atomic cooling . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , molecular chemistry is also included to calculate the co intensity maps . </S>",
    "<S> our results show the following : ( 1 ) multi - epoch bullets interacting with the toroidal dense core can produce the collimated multiple lobes as seen in crl 618 . </S>",
    "<S> the total mass of the bullets is @xmath0 0.034 m@xmath1 , consistent with the observed high - velocity co emission in fast molecular outflows . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) the simulated co @xmath22 intensity maps show that the low - velocity cavity wall and the high - velocity outflows along the lobes are reasonably consistent with the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the position - velocity diagram of the outflows along the outflow axes shows a linear increase of velocity with distance , similar to the observations . </S>",
    "<S> the ejections of these bullets could be due to magneto - rotational explosions or nova - like explosions around a binary companion . </S>"
