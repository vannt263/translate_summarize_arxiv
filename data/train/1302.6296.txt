    "vfts102 is a rapidly rotating o - type star in the 30 doradus region of the large magellanic cloud , and its projected rotational velocity is larger than 500 km s@xmath1 and probably as large as 600 km s@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it rotates more rapidly than any observed stars in recent large surveys @xcite and would appear to be the most rapidly rotating massive star @xcite .",
    "the rapidly rotating stars such as vfts102 form an important class of objects in several respects .",
    "these stars could help us to study the rotational effects that are important , from star formation through to their deaths @xcite .",
    "fast rotation could change the lifetime and evolution of massive stars by rotationally induced mixing between the core and envelope @xcite , and produce enrichment of a number of different elements at the stellar surface @xcite .",
    "the rotationally induced mixing were used to explain the variety of core collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "in addition , the rotating massive stars might be the progenitors of gamma - ray bursts through homogeneous evolution @xcite .",
    "two channels for the formation of vfts102 have been proposed in the past .",
    "the first channel is the mass transfer channel @xcite . in this channel",
    ", vfts102 might be the mass gainer and be spun up by a past episode of roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) in an interacting binary system @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that vfts102 became a runaway star after its companion exploded as a supernova .",
    "this channel could also explain that the radial velocity of vfts102 differs by 40 km s@xmath1 from the mean radial velocity for 30 doradus .",
    "the second channel is the collision channel @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that vfts102 had experienced a earlier collision , and then might be ejected from the cluster center .",
    "the fast rotation of vfts102 might be the result of the collision with another star in the cluster center .",
    "in addition , vfts102 might be born as rapid rotator @xcite or its surface might spin up during the main sequence ( ms ) evolution because angular momentum was transported from the center to the stellar surface @xcite .    from a binary evolution point of view , these formation channels are not complete .",
    "the binary merger might be another possible channel to produce the fastest rotating star vfts102 . in this channel ,",
    "the initial detached binary would experience case a mass transfer and evolve into contact while two components are still on the ms , and then merge into a rapidly rotating single star @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the fraction of massive stars that are members of a close binary is very large @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that 20% of all stars born as o - type stars would merge as a result of case a mass transfer .",
    "in addition , the observations show that the massive contact binaries are relatively common , such as v606 cen ( @xmath6=1.495d * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and tu mus ( @xmath6=1.387d * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and @xmath7 of o - type stars appear to be in contact with orbital periods of @xmath8days @xcite .",
    "these massive contact binaries might merge into single stars in a similar way as low - mass contact binaries , which might merge into single stars due to tidal instability when the spin angular momentum of the system is more than a third of its orbital angular momentum @xcite , or due to thermal instability when the primary attempts to cross the hertzsprung gap @xcite .",
    "the merger of contact binaries are expected to result in single , massive stars @xcite , which would be extremely rapidly rotating due to the orbital angular momentum of the binary systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , the binary merger might be a possible channel for the production of vfts102 .",
    "the evolution of massive close binaries has been investigated by many authors , e.g. @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the case a binary evolution and constructed a large grid of models ( 0.8@xmath9 ) .",
    "they mapped out the initial parameters in the mass ratio - orbital period plane of six subtypes of case a evolution .",
    "they suggested that three of these subtypes ( ar , as , ad ) lead to contact while both components are on the ms . in case ar or as ,",
    "the secondary expands in response to the thermal time - scale mass transfer or the nuclear time - scale mass transfer from the primary and fills its own roche lobe .",
    "the system probably form a stable contact binary , and might ultimately merge into a single star . however , in case ad , the secondary can not accrete all the proffered material transfer from the primary on the dynamical time - scale .",
    "this probably leads very quickly to a common envelope , spiral - in @xcite , and coalescence on a quite short timescale @xcite .",
    "case ad might be common in the low mass binaries @xcite , especially in those binaries with two m dwarf components observed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "few massive systems are classified as ad and most of massive contact systems are classified as ar or as @xcite .",
    "therefore , the investigation of the evolution of massive binaries in case ar and as is important to understand the formation of massive contact binaries , and then the formation of the rapidly rotating stars such as vfts102 .",
    "the purpose of this study is to investigate the binary merger channel for the progenitor of vfts102 and to determine the detailed parameter range in which this channel produces vfts102 . employing the eggleton s stellar evolution code",
    ", we construct a grid of binary models for metallicity @xmath10 in section 2 and 3 , and then implement the results in a binary population synthesis study in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we give the discussion and conclusions .",
    "in the binary merger channel for the progenitor of the fastest rotating o - type star vfts102 , the primary of the initial detached binary would fill its roche lobe and transfer some of its mass to the secondary .",
    "the secondary expands in response to the mass transfer from the primary .",
    "this system would evolve into contact if the secondary fills its own roche lobe when two components are still ms stars .",
    "these contact systems would ultimately merge into rotating stars due to the orbital angular momentum of the binary systems @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if both components are ms stars in case a binaries , the merged stars would be ms stars and evolve in a similar way to a normal star with that mass @xcite .",
    "therefore , the merged stars with the same mass as vfts102 might be similar to vfts102 .",
    "there are some constraints on the progenitor of vfts102 in the binary merger model .",
    "first , the detached binary , as the progenitor of vfts102 , should evolve into contact while two component are still on the ms , which is largely determined by the initial period and mass ratio .",
    "secondly , the total mass of the progenitor binary should be larger than or equal to the mass of vfts102 , which depends on the mass loss during the evolution and the merger process .",
    "the current mass of vfts102 is approximately 25m@xmath11 @xcite . in this study",
    ", we do not consider the mass loss during the evolution and merger process and assume that the binary system as the progenitor of vfts102 has total mass @xmath12m@xmath13 .",
    "the merger process is complicated and the merger physics is still uncertain . here , we adopt the following assumptions : ( i ) the binary systems merge immediately once both ms components fill their roche lobes ; ( ii ) the merged stars are homogeneously mixed ; ( iii ) the system mass is conserved .",
    "the merged timescale ( i.e. the time from a binary contact to merger ) for massive contact binaries has remained unclear and we only adopt a simple assumption that the merger is instantaneous .",
    "as the components of contact binaries rotate rapidly during the merger process , the merged stars would be efficiently mixed .",
    "these merged stars might also undergo rotationally induced mixing during the subsequent evolution @xcite , which is important in the evolution of massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore , it is reasonable to assume that the merged stars are homogeneously mixed .",
    "we roughly assume that the mass is conservative during the merger process .",
    "in fact , the binary systems might lose high angular momentum material during the merger process and the merged stars might rotate at subcritical rotation velocities @xcite .",
    "the second and the third assumptions were often adopted in the study of the formation of blue stragglers by the binary merger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "to determine whether the detached binary evolves into contact when two component are still ms stars , it is necessary to perform detailed binary evolution calculations .",
    "here we use eggleton s stellar evolution code originally developed by @xcite .",
    "this code has been updated with the latest input physics during the last four decades ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "we calculated our models with metallicity @xmath10 ( hydrogen abundance @xmath14 and helium abundance @xmath15 ) , which is close to the chemical composition of large magellanic cloud ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "the mass transfer is determined to be dynamic when the mass - transfer is greater than @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the thermal or kelvin - helmholtz timescale @xcite .",
    "we construct a grid of stellar evolutionary models that covers the following ranges of initial primary mass @xmath19 and initial mass ratio ( @xmath20 ) : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the period at which the initially more massive component would just fill its roche lobe on the zero - age ms @xcite .",
    "the orbits are assumed to be circular .",
    "a binary is expected to become circularized during the rlof by the tidal force on a timescale which is much smaller than the nuclear timescale @xcite .",
    "we assume that both total mass and orbital angular momentum are conserved in the evolution of the binaries .",
    "if the loss of the total mass and orbital angular momentum is considered , the orbit of the initial detached binaries would quickly shrink .",
    "more detached binaries with longer period would evolve into rlof and contact , which could not evolve into contact in the conservation evolution .",
    "in fig . 1 , we present two representative examples of our binary evolution calculations that could evolve into contact while two components are still on the ms .",
    "it shows the evolutionary track in the radius - mass diagram , the mass - transfer rate and the evolution of the orbital period .",
    "figs 1(a ) , ( c ) and ( e ) represent the evolution of a binary system with an initial mass of the primary of @xmath25 = 1.20 ( @xmath19 = 15.85m@xmath11 ) , an initial mass ratio of @xmath26=0.20 ( @xmath27 ) and an initial orbital period of @xmath28 ( @xmath29d ) .",
    "the components start to evolve from point a and a , and the primary fills its roche lobe on the ms at point b which results in case a rlof ( bc ) as shown in fig .",
    "the secondary expands in response to the mass transfer ( bc ) and fills its roche lobe at point c. this system evolves into contact shortly after the start of rlof . the mass - transfer rate from the primary to the secondary is not greater than @xmath17 as shown in fig.1(c ) .",
    "therefore , the mass transfer is on a thermal time - scale and this case of binary evolution is classed as case ar @xcite .",
    "1(e ) shows that the orbital period of the system decreases from 1.498 to 1.37d during the mass transfer phase because the mass is transferred from the massive component to the low - mass component .",
    "figs 1(b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) show another example for an initial mass of the primary of @xmath30 = 1.15 ( @xmath19 = 14.13m@xmath13 ) , an initial mass ratio of @xmath26=0.10 ( @xmath31 ) and an initial orbital period of @xmath32 ( @xmath33d ) .",
    "the main difference between this example and the previous one is that the secondary fills its own roche lobe , not during the rapid mass transfer phase ( bc ) , but during the subsequent slow mass transfer phase ( cd ) as shown in fig .",
    "this case of binary evolution is identified as case as @xcite . in this case , as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , the mass transfer rate is about @xmath34m@xmath11/yr during the rapid mass transfer phase ( bc ) and about @xmath35m@xmath13/yr during the slow mass transfer phase ( cd ) . the orbital period of this system first decreases from 1.142 to 1.097d , and then increases to 1.478d after the mass ratio is reversed as shown in fig .",

    "crosses indicate the systems that could not evolve into contact while two components are still on ms .",
    "we also present the boundaries ( solid lines ) for the initial parameters for which might be the progenitor of vfts102 .",
    "the right boundaries are set by the condition that the system could evolve into contact while two components are still on the ms .",

    "2 , which are set by the period ( @xmath38 ) at which the initially more massive component would just fill its roche lobe on the zero - age ms .",
    "it is seen from fig .",
    "2 that the progenitor binary of vfts102 with @xmath3 ( @xmath390.2 ) should have an initial orbital period shorter than @xmath4days and they would evolve into contact during the rapid mass transfer phase .",
    "the progenitor binary of vfts102 with @xmath40 ( @xmath410.2 ) should have an initial orbital period shorter than @xmath5days and they would evolve into contact during the rapid or slow mass transfer phase .",
    "we have performed a series of detailed monte carlo simulations to investigate the binary merger channel . in each simulation , we follow the evolution of 100 million sample binaries ( very wide binaries are actually single stars ) according to grids of stellar models of metallicity @xmath42 and the evolution channels described above .",
    "we adopt the following input for the simulations : the initial mass function ( imf ) of the primaries , the initial mass - ratio distribution , and the distribution of initial orbital separations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the fraction of binaries that experience case a and merge is about 14.8% , which is larger than 8.7% found in this study .",
    "this is because they assumed that case a mass transfer always leads to a merger of two component , in which some of binaries would reach contact while one or both components evolve past the terminal ms @xcite , and these binaries are not considered in our study .",
    "in addition , @xcite suggested that up to 10% or more of the stars would be merger remnants , which is close to the result of our study ( 17.1% ) .",
