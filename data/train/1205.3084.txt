    "the setup of our detection scheme based on the sine - wave gating and low - pass filtering technique is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinegating ] .",
    "it comprises essentially the sine wave generation stage , the single photon avalanche diode ( spad , jds uniphase ) in a capacitively coupled bias - t circuit , the filtering stage and a supervising xilinx virtex-5 fpga ( field - programmable gate array ) for generating the raw gate signals and for post - processing the detection signals .",
    "we use a fast gigabit transceiver ( xilinx gtp ) to interconnect the fpga with the detector hardware .",
    "the sine gates are generated by the gtp transmitter periodically transmitting square pulses with the gate frequency , which subsequently can be digitally delayed in 10  ps intervals in order to allow a temporal tuning between the gates and the incoming signals .",
    "this electrical pulse train is filtered using a sequence of band - pass filters with spectra centered around the gate frequency and a width sufficiently small to remove higher harmonic frequency components .",
    "the obtained sine signal is amplified to the required amplitude determined by the desired gate width .",
    "after a further filtering step to remove frequency sidebands potentially generated by non - linear gain in the power amplifier , the produced gate signals typically have a peak - to - peak amplitude of around 8  v.    under sine gating , the unfiltered output signal of the spad is largely dominated by the capacitive response of the diode to the gate frequency . to discriminate the weak avalanche signals which are orders of magnitude smaller , we process the output of the spad by a low noise power amplifier ( wenteq 20 - 3000  mhz ) and a sequence of low pass filters ( crystek clpfl-0600 ) which suppress the capacitive response of the diode .",
    "each filter has a transmission spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : avalanchespectra ] ( dotted curve ) .",
    "it yields a 1.25  ghz band rejection of -54  db , and we measured more than -40  db attenuation for higher frequencies up to 4  ghz , sufficient to suppresses the most dominant harmonic frequencies .",
    "moreover , as the band rejection remains below -50  db over a range of more than 100  mhz , this filtering technique does not require a precise frequency matching between the gate frequency and the filter as opposed to band stop filtering or self - differencing techniques .",
    "however , throughout the report we restrict our analysis to a gate frequency of 1.25  ghz .    after the filtering stage the avalanche signal is discriminated by a standard threshold discriminator .",
    "a final delay allows to temporally adjust the discriminator pulses with the 400  ps sampling cycles of the fpga .",
    "we note , that in general sine gating prevents the usual approach of applying a hold - off time after each detection during which the detector is biased below breakdown and no avalanche , including due to afterpulsing , can be triggered .",
    "instead , we post - process detections depending on their separation from the previous detection and discard all events which occur during a certain hold - off period . if not stated otherwise , we have programmed the fpga for all the results presented here with a logic hold - off period of 10  gates corresponding to 8  ns during which we discard all detections .",
    "to characterize the performance of the detector , we use a synchronized output of the fpga at 31.25  mhz to trigger a pulsed laser diode ( picoquant pdl 800-b ) producing short 30  ps optical pulses which are attenuated to 0.1 photons per pulse and temporally well aligned with the detector gates .",
    "the spectra of the detector output are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : avalanchespectra ] without and with weak illumination and indicate that sufficient contributions remain even by considering only frequency components below 1  ghz . in fig .  [",
    "fig : outpulse ] the average avalanche signal after the second low - pass filter captured with a 6  ghz digitizing oscilloscope ( lecroy wavemaster 8600 ) is shown .",
    "it yields a clear peak of 32  mv amplitude and a falling edge of 1.8  ns length .        the gray curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : outpulse ] show examples of individual avalanche signals which exhibit fluctuations in amplitude and width . in order to characterize the impact of these fluctuating pulse shapes on the detection jitter we measured the detection time histogram using a time - correlated single photon counting module ( b&h spc-130 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcspchist ] the histogram yields a major peak of width 76  ps ( fwhm ) from laser pulse detections . taking the laser pulse width and jitter into account this corresponds to a very low detector timing jitter of only 70  ps .",
    "however , after the main histogram peak , detections also occur between gates , and around 2.4  % of all detections appear in one of the three subsequent gates after the main peak where they are nt expected . as the tcspc module only registers the first detection per cycle , the detection in subsequent gates could not be due to afterpulsing .",
    "additionally , we used the fpga acquisition to analyze the correlations between subsequent detections which confirmed that these erroneous detections do not yield the correlations typically observed from afterpulsing . from this",
    "we rather identify the timing jitter induced by the low pass filters and the fluctuating amplitudes of the avalanche signals as sources of these errors . replacing the standard discriminator by a constant - fraction discriminator ( cfd ) might help to reduce this effect in future .",
    "nevertheless , as a second possibility these errors could still be caused by afterpulsing , if the previous avalanche triggering an afterpulse is too small to be discriminated . in this case , no correlations are observed .",
    "this could happen for detections occurring at the end of a gate where the number of generated avalanche electrons is much smaller than for detections at the beginning of a gate .",
    "[ fig : deteffdcbias ] shows the performance of the detector in terms of dark count probability per gate and detection efficiency when the temperature of the spad is reduced to @xmath2c and the bias voltage is scanned . with increasing bias voltage the detection efficiency increases linearly and corresponds to 0.1 when the dark count probability per gate is @xmath3 . to measure the effective width of the gate",
    ", we change the temporal alignment between the incoming optical pulses and the detector gate by scanning the upper delay in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinegating ] . from the resulting detection statistics in fig .",
    "[ fig : gateshape ] we obtain the maximal detection efficiency of 0.1 in the center while the full width at half maximum gate width is as low as 130  ps .",
    "the dark count probability normalized per nanosecond hence corresponds to @xmath4 comparable to the results obtained using the diode with a conventional low frequency gating technique .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the impairment due to different noise contributions depends largely on the detector temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdctempdep ] we show the dark count probability per gate , i.e. the probability of a detection when no light is impinging the detector and the temperature is varied over a range between @xmath5c and @xmath6c .",
    "the bias voltage is adjusted respectively to keep the excess bias constant such that the detection efficiency would constantly amount to 0.1 .",
    "the minimum amount of noise corresponding to a probability of @xmath7 per gate is detected at a temperature of @xmath8c while for higher temperatures the amount of thermally activated dark counts is increased .     per gate , and a probability of @xmath9 per gate at @xmath10c . ]",
    "due to its very low dark count probability and timing jitter , the detection scheme presented here promises to be well suited for high rate , long distance quantum key distribution . in the following",
    "we present the results which characterize the performance of the detector in a qkd setup based on the coherent one - way protocol @xcite , but equivalent results in terms of detection rate and quantum bit error rate ( qber ) should be achievable with any other qkd setup .    in the cow implementation , alice tailors the output of a continuous coherent laser to produce pulse - position modulated ( ppm @xcite ) quantum states , where one bit of information is encoded in the position of an optical pulse out of two possible time - bins per bit . for pulse",
    "shaping we use an intensity modulator ( photline mxer - ln ) with a measured extinction ratio of 25  db , the bit frequency is 625  mbps ( mega bits per second ) . at the receiver side , bob decodes the information by analyzing the detection times with his fpga .",
    "errors in this detection schemes correspond to events registered in the wrong of two possible time - bins of 400  ps width .",
    "all detections outside the 400  ps wide time - bins are discarded and do not contribute to the detection or error rates .",
    "first , we estimate the performance of the detector for qkd over different fiber lengths . as the average number of photons per bit reaching the detector",
    "does not only depend on the fiber transmission , but also on the number of photons sent by alice , and , hence , on the implemented qkd protocol , the results presented in fig .  [ fig : skrs ] are given as a function of the number of impinging photons per bit . here , the detector temperature is @xmath2c and the dc - bias voltage 53.5  v. for an average of 1  photon per bit the detection rate is 33  mbps , corresponding well to the expected rate of 31  mbps when a poissonian photon number distribution and reduction due to the 8  ns hold - off time is taken into account . with lower photon numbers , the raw detection rate decreases linearly as expected .",
    "the qber in fig .",
    "[ fig : skrs ] yields a value as low as 2.0  % for 0.001 impinging photons per bit , matching the expected value given by the detector noise . in a standard bb84 setup without decoy states",
    "this impinging photon number would correspond to a transmission over 75  km standard fiber , for a cow implementation it would correspond to 115  km .",
    "however , at higher photon numbers per bit ( or shorter fiber lengths ) , the qber yields a minimum value of 1.6  % which is above the expected lower limit of 0.2  % given by the extinction ratio ( 25  db ) of alice intensity modulator preparing the states . as discussed in the previous section , the erroneous detections were not correlated with previous detections and for the moment we ca nt distinguish with certainty whether they stem from timing jitter or afterpulsing . however , in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcspchist ] around 2.4  % of all detections appeared in one of the three gates after the main detection peak , which together with errors due to the extinction ratio of alice intensity modulator explain an error rate of at least 1.4  % .",
    "taking the measured qber into account , we also show the expected rates corresponding to the situation after error correction . for the cow protocol ( assuming individual attacks ) , the performance of our detector would allow to generate more than 1  mbps ( mega bit per second ) of secret keys up to a fiber attenuation of 4  db , corresponding to a standard fiber with attenuation coefficient 0.2  db / km of 20  km length .",
    "we have also tested the detector performance for qkd at different temperatures . at a bias voltage of 53.5  v the laser pulses were attenuated down to 0.1  photons per pulse at the detector input , corresponding to the optimum configuration over 25 km fiber length with 0.3 photons per pulse .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : rectemp ] show that for this fiber lengths the detector allows for high rate qkd even at room temperature of @xmath11c .",
    "although this result stems merely from the very short gate durations at high gate frequency which reduces the amount of detected noise per gate , it suggests that the size and complexity of current single photon detectors could largely be reduced as no bulky cooling mechanics is required ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : detector ] ) .",
    "this might allow for reducing the mechanical dimensions of future qkd platforms as developed in the qcrypt project @xcite and might even pave the way for the development of small handheld size qkd devices .",
    "as stability and reliability of the detection hardware is a major requirement for robust long - term quantum key distribution , we have run the detector over several hours and monitored the detection statistics . as the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : skrstime ] show , the detection and error rates remain constant over a measurement period of 8 hours without any further stabilization .",
    "however , as we expect temporal alignment drifts between the optical pulses and the detector gates for long fiber lengths , the final qkd setup will comprise a continuous tracking system to actively compensate for temperature induced fiber length variations .",
    "we have presented the results of an implementation and characterization of a 1.25  ghz gated ingaas / inp single photon avalanche diode with simple low - pass filtering technique suitable for fast qkd operation .",
    "we have demonstrated that our sine gating and filtering technique largely limits the amount of detected noise as the gate width is as short as 130  ps . at a detection efficiency of 0.1 we obtain a dark count probability as low as @xmath12 per gate and a timing jitter of 70  ps .",
    "the detector works remarkably well over a wide temperature range and allows for qkd over more than 25  km even at room temperature . as the low - pass filtering technique for sine gating does not require a precise adaption to the gate frequency and is very robust against environmental temperature fluctuations or mechanical stresses ,",
    "the results presented here might be used to reduce the size and complexity of fast single photon detectors at telecom wavelength and of quantum communication systems employing them .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge the fruitful input and discussions with herv eusbe and gabriel bernasconi from hepia geneva , as well as matthieu legr from i d quantique sa .",
