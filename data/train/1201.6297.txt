    "short after the theory of superconductivity @xcite showed up it has been realized @xcite that such a formalism might work also for nuclear systems although the constituents number is relatively small .",
    "many applications have been performed with a single constant for the interaction strength of various paired states .",
    "all calculations were based on the supposition that the particle number is conserved only in the average .",
    "amazingly the pairing force and the emerging seniority scheme has been introduced much earlier , by racah @xcite . a serious question arose , namely to what extent the particle number fluctuations affect some physical observables . attempting to answer such a question many authors used a projected particle number formalism .",
    "two distinct calculations have been employed .",
    "occupation probabilities are determined first variationally with a standard bcs wave function and then the components of given number of nucleons are projected out .",
    "the resulting procedure is conventionally called the particle number projected bcs and as we said already the projection is performed after variation .",
    "the second set of calculations perform the variation after projection .",
    "the particle number projection has been first considered by bayman in ref .",
    "there the averages of the hamiltonian , including the mean field and pairing terms , and of particle number operator are expressed as functions of some residuum integrals which where estimated by the saddle - point method .",
    "the saddle point approximately satisfies an equation which is similar to the particle number equation of the bcs formalism . under these conditions the euler - lagrange equations obtained with",
    "a particle number projected variational state are identical to the standard bcs equations .",
    "the projection procedure was improved in refs .",
    "the residuum integrals were calculated by the saddle - point method with the integral path chosen such that it crosses the saddle - point on a line of steepest descent . moreover",
    "two - dimensional recursion formulas for the residuum integrals were provided .",
    "an extensive analysis of ordinary bcs , pbcs ( projected bcs with projection after variation ) and fbcs ( variation after projection ) is performed within a two levels pairing model  @xcite .",
    "another feature which was considered , referred to the centrifugal coriolis anti - pairing effect .",
    "the coriolis interaction tends to decrease the pairing strength and at a critical angular frequency the gap equation has only the trivial solution . in refs .",
    "@xcite it is found that crossing the critical point the rotational energy exhibits a discontinuity which as a matter of fact , is not confirmed by the fbcs calculations of ref.@xcite .",
    "clearly the occupation probabilities emerging from a fbcs formalism are different from those associated with the ordinary bcs , the difference being function of the pairing interaction strength .",
    "the idea of particle number projection was extended to angular momentum .",
    "indeed , the cranking model with a particle number projected wave function was considered @xcite to investigate the backbending phenomena .",
    "the simultaneous projection of the particle number and angular momentum from a pairing correlated many body system has been considered in ref .",

    "many papers have been devoted to the issues mentioned above @xcite focusing on explaining some properties like , gap parameter , moment of inertia , spectroscopic factors , pairing versus nuclear deformation , and angular momentum .",

    "the results reported there demonstrate that the generalized bogoliubov - valatin ( bv ) transformation including @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 pairing is appropriate for treating the pairing correlations in a self - consistent way , in spite of some earlier pessimistic views on this issue @xcite .",
    "note that in a generalized ( bv ) formalism both the total number of nucleons , the isospin third component ( t3 ) and isospin ( t ) are not conserved .",
    "therefore a simultaneous projection for all the three quantum numbers is necessary .",
    "this type of projection has been considered by several authors both numerically and analytically @xcite .",
    "the integrability of a @xmath4 pairing model was treated in refs .",
    "@xcite by different methods .",
    "thus the pairing hamiltonian introduced by richardson in ref.@xcite was considered in the context of the quantum inverse scattering method .",
    "it is proved that the model is integrable by constructing explicitly the conserved commuting operators .",
    "the eigenvalues of these operators were determined in terms of the bethe ansatz and finally an expression for energy eigenvalues was possible @xcite .",
    "a different method is applied , in ref.@xcite , to the same richardson model which includes isospin - symmetry breaking terms .",
    "it seems that the common mathematical content with the above pairing correlated system is a serious ground for considering the pairing effect for other systems .",

    "let us make use of this remark .",
    "consider the fundamental representation and replace the operators @xmath34 by the pauli matrices divided by 2 .",
    "next , we expand the left and right sides of the expression ( [ order ] ) in the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath36 . the decomposition over @xmath37 is necessarily truncated at the terms linear in @xmath37 due the equation @xmath38 valid for the spin-1/2 representation .",
    "thus , one obtains a system of algebraic equations for @xmath33 whose solutions as can easily be checked are given by equations ( [ alphapm ] ) and ( [ alphaze ] ) .",
    "the algebraic method is fully equivalent to solving the system of ordinary differential equations ( [ ode ] ) .",
    "we assumed , so far , that the rotation angle @xmath6 and the unit vector @xmath7 are real quantities .",
    "however , in the above development the condition for the mentioned variables to be real was not explicitly used .",

    "we have used only commutation relations for the generators of rotations .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath43 can be obtained by using the fact that under the replacement of @xmath44 the commutation relations ( [ commutangular ] ) remain unchanged . from this",

    "the two figures mentioned before exhibit some common features .",
    "energies are decreasing functions of g. they show a linear dependence on g with the slope depending on the particle total number , @xmath1 .",

    "the transition from one energy ordering to another is taking place for different values of g. the largest critical @xmath245 is met for the standard bcs . to get a better view on the quantitative energy split due to its @xmath1-dependence we collected the energy values for the extreme values of @xmath1 , in table i. from there",
    "one can see that the energy ordering for a given @xmath245 is not depending on @xmath1 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath247 the ordering for @xmath248 and @xmath249 are : @xmath250 while for @xmath251 the energy order is as : @xmath252 it is remarkable the fact that energies provided by the pbcs and fbcs approaches are practically the same .",
    "only very tiny differences are noticed for g=0.1 mev , which might be caused by the numerical procedures adopted for the two cases .",
    "due to the above mentioned ordering for the ground state energies provided by different formalism we may conclude that for all cases the superconducting phase is achieved for any @xmath253 .",
    "another observable considered in our study is the energy gap obtained within the standard bcs and the fbcs formalism , respectively .",
    "the results obtained for a fixed @xmath1 were plotted as function of @xmath245 in figure 3 and 4 , respectively .",
    "these figures show a linear dependence of both gaps on g. the split of gaps due to their @xmath1 dependence is larger for @xmath220 than for @xmath254 .",
    "indeed , according to the data listed in table i , @xmath255 is equal to 0.212 mev and 2.338 mev for @xmath245 equal to 0.1 mev and 1.0 mev respectively , while @xmath256 for @xmath257mev , amounts to 0.146 mev and 1.633 mev , respectively .",
    "note that for a given set of @xmath1 and @xmath245 we have @xmath258 .",
    "since the energy gap might be looked at as a measure of superconductivity one may expect that the superconductivity effects are more pronounced in the pbcs and fbcs than in the bcs .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath171 can be diagonalized in a basis of definite number of particles , @xmath1 @xmath259 with @xmath260 standing for the normalization constant .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath261 in this basis have simple expressions :    @xmath262^{1/2},\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\langle n_1 - 2 , n_2 + 2|h|n_1,n_2\\rangle = -\\frac{g}{4}\\left[n_1(n_2 + 2)(4j_1 + 4-n_1)(4j_2 + 2-n_2)\\right]^{1/2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for each @xmath1 and a fixed @xmath245 , we diagonalized the above matrix and depicted the lowest eigenvalues .",
    "further , these were compared with the energies provided by the fbcs and the pbcs formalisms . in this way we found out that the three sets of energies are identical",
    "this is a nice example when the solution of two variational principle equations reproduce the exact ground state energy .",
    "however , in a realistic single particle space and , moreover , when an isospin invariant hamiltonian is instead considered , this feature does not necessarily show up .",
    "many interesting properties of the @xmath4 pairing have been derived using for the bcs function the form ( 3.1 ) . after making use of the factorization described in section i",
    ", one finds out that the function ( 3.1 ) for a fixed @xmath91 represents , the coherent state of the su(2 ) group generated by @xmath263 .",
    "our attention was focused on the nucleon number projected bcs . since any matrix element can be expressed in terms of the norms of the involved states , we started with the norm calculation .",
    "one of the main results of the present paper is the recursive formula for these norms . by this equation",
    "the norm of a projected state with n particles is related with the norms of the @xmath264-projected states with @xmath265 . for pairing interaction of alike nucleons ,",
    "a similar recursion formula was obtained in ref .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "the difference between the two recursion formulas consists of that there the recursion is operating in two dimensions , there are two indices which are iterated , while here only one index is involved in the recursion .    to prove the usefulness of the obtained recursion formula several matrix elements have been evaluated .",
    "the one for the proton - neutron pairing operator of a given shell , is interpreted as spectroscopic factor for a deuteron transfer reaction .",
    "being guided by the analogy with the alike nucleon pairing we defined a quantity which might be a measure for the energy gap in the particle number projected picture . also , we calculated the occupation probability for a given state with a proton - neutron pair . in appendix",
    "a the matrix element involved in the width of an @xmath91 decay process is analytically expressed .",
    "also , the matrix element for the two body proton - neutron interaction in the particle - particle channel between the states associated with the mother and daughter nuclei involved in a double beta fermi decay , are obtained in a compact form .    using a hamiltonian including a mean field term and a proton - neutron pairing interaction we calculated the system energy as function of the particle number n and the parameters @xmath266 defining the unprojected bcs wave function . since many features of the paired system can be found also in a restricted single particle space we discussed the simple cases of one and two single particle states . since the energy associated to a single @xmath60 and the @xmath1-projected picture , is constant with respect to the bcs parameters we concluded that for this case a superconducting phase can not be reached . however , the case of two j is suitable for studying the pairing properties both in the standard bcs and projected bcs formalism . in the later situation we considered both cases when the variation is performed before and after projection . in the two level situation",
    "we have proved that the ground state energy provided by the pbcs , fbcs are the same and moreover equal to the exact ground state energy obtained by diagonalization .",
    "it is an open question whether this feature is caused by the restricted single particle space or by the particular choice o the model many - body hamiltonian .",
    "one of the evident limitations of our formalism consists in the fact that the trial bcs unprojected function allows us to describe only nuclei with n = z .",
    "this feature can be however improved by adding to ( 3.1 ) two factors accounting for the proton - proton and neutron - neutron pairing , respectively .    as an imminent project for the near future we also mention the extension of our formalism to isospin preserving hamiltonians . in the second step of the formalism development we shall attempt to include in our study the proton - neutron @xmath267 pairing as well as the isospin projection .",
