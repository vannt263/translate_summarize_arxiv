    "in contrast to the static vertex and edge colorings classically studied in graph theory , recent years have seen the development of dynamic graph colorings , which are allowed to change in time according to predefined rules .",
    "one of the predominant dynamic colorings is the result of the _ forcing process _ , defined as follows : given a simple graph @xmath0 , let @xmath1 be an initial set of _ colored _ vertices , all remaining vertices being _",
    "uncolored_. at each integer valued time step , a colored vertex with a single uncolored neighbor will _ force _ that neighbor to become colored ; such a vertex is called a _ forcing vertex_. a set @xmath1 of initially colored vertices is called a _ forcing set _ if , by iteratively applying the forcing process , all of @xmath2 becomes colored .",
    "the _ forcing number _ of a graph @xmath3 , denoted @xmath4 , is the cardinality of a smallest forcing set .",
    "forcing on graphs was originally introduced in a workshop on linear algebra and graph theory in 2006 @xcite and was used to bound the minimum rank of a graph . in place of @xmath4 .",
    "we choose to conform to the newer nomenclature which appeared in a recent generalization of zero forcing to @xmath5-forcing ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . ]",
    "namely , if @xmath3 is a graph whose vertices are labeled from @xmath6 to @xmath7 , and @xmath8 denotes the minimum rank over all symmetric real valued matrices , where for @xmath9 , the @xmath10 entry is nonzero if and only if @xmath11 is an edge in @xmath3 , then @xmath12 .",
    "though the forcing number originated in relation to the minimum rank problem , forcing sets and the forcing number have since found a variety of applications in physics , logic circuits , coding theory , power network monitoring , and in modeling the spread of diseases and information in social networks ; see @xcite . the forcing number has also been used to bound or approximate various graph parameters @xcite .",
    "computing @xmath4 is @xmath13-hard @xcite , though closed formulas and characterizations do exist for graphs with specified structure ( see @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main obstacles in studying @xmath4 is the fact that , in general , very little can be said about the structure of a forcing set .",
    "this difficulty motivated the investigations of the present paper .",
    "in particular , we inquire what can be said about the forcing process and forcing number of a graph , if the initial forcing set is assumed to be connected . more formally , if @xmath14 is a forcing set of @xmath3 , and @xmath14 induces a connected subgraph , we say that @xmath14 is a _ connected forcing set_. the _ connected forcing number _ , denoted @xmath15 , is the cardinality of a minimum connected forcing set in @xmath3 , and is the main focus of this paper .",
    "in particular , we study the connected forcing number of several families of graphs including trees , flower snarks , hypercubes , and graphs with a single maximal clique of size greater than 2 , with the hope of understanding the underlying structure of forcing sets in general , as well as exploring this newly defined graph invariant . throughout this paper",
    ", we also recall various results related to forcing and other graph parameters , and compare them to our results about connected forcing .",
    "we leave the computational complexity of connected forcing as an open question .",
    "some of the examples and results given in this paper indicate that the connectivity of the forcing set can make the problem somewhat easier . on the other hand",
    ", we note that the related problem of graph domination and its connected variant are both np - hard @xcite .",
    "however , it may be possible to efficiently compute the connected forcing number of families of graphs with polynomially many connected subgraphs , by adapting existing algorithms for computing the forcing number @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we recall some graph theoretic notions and notations . in section 3 ,",
    "we show a number of relations between forcing and connected forcing in graphs , and prove several technical lemmas . in section 4 ,",
    "we give closed forms and bounds for the connected forcing numbers of trees , graphs with a single maximal clique of size greater than  2 , and flower snarks ; we also characterize graphs with extreme connected forcing numbers .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks and open questions in section  5 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a graph .",
    "the order and size of @xmath3 will be denoted by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "two vertices @xmath18 are said to be adjacent , or neighbors , if there exists the edge @xmath19 .",
    "the open neighborhood of @xmath20 is the set of all vertices which are adjacent to @xmath21 , denoted @xmath22 ; the dependence on @xmath3 can be omitted when it is clear from the context .",
    "the degree of @xmath20 is defined as @xmath23 . the minimum degree and maximum degree of @xmath3",
    "will be denoted as @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "a _ leaf _ or _ pendant _ is a vertex with degree 1 .",
    "the _ leaf number _ of @xmath3 , denoted @xmath26 , is the number of leaves of @xmath3 .",
    "the leaf number of a vertex @xmath21 is defined as @xmath27 , i.e. , the number of leaves adjacent to @xmath21 .",
    "path cover _ of @xmath3 is a set of vertex - disjoint induced paths in @xmath3 which contain all the vertices of @xmath3 .",
    "the _ path cover number _ of @xmath3 , denoted @xmath28 , is the minimum size of a path cover .",
    "the _ maximum nullity _ of @xmath3 with vertex set @xmath29 is defined as the maximum nullity over all symmetric real valued matrices , where for @xmath9 , the @xmath10 entry is nonzero if and only if @xmath11 is an edge in @xmath3 , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "a _ clique _ of @xmath3 is a complete subgraph ; for our purposes , it will be convenient to think of a clique as a maximal ( with respect to inclusion ) complete subgraph .",
    "an _ articulation point _",
    "( also called a _ cut vertex _ ) is a vertex which , when removed , increases the number of connected components in @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , a _ bridge _ ( also called a _ cut edge _ ) is an edge which , when removed , increases the number of components of @xmath3 . a _ biconnected component _ or",
    "_ block _ of @xmath3 is a maximal subgraph of @xmath3 which has no articulation points .",
    "because disconnected graphs can never have a connected forcing set , we will consider only connected graphs for the remainder of this paper . for other graph theoretic terminology and definitions , we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to present our study of connected forcing .",
    "in this section , we study relations between the connected forcing number and other graph parameters such as the forcing number , maximum nullity , path cover number , and leaf number . we also compare several properties of minimum connected forcing sets and minimum forcing sets . in later sections ,",
    "we give several additional relations between forcing and connected forcing .",
    "our first simple observation is that since any connected forcing set is also a forcing set , any minimum connected forcing set will contain a ( not necessarily minimum ) forcing set .",
    "thus , we have the following result .    [ geq_fact ] for any connected graph @xmath3 , @xmath31 , and this bound is sharp .",
    "graphs for which observation [ geq_fact ] is sharp include paths , cycles , and complete graphs .",
    "the following observation can help us come up with other , non - trivial examples .",
    "[ iff_fact ] for any connected graph @xmath3 , @xmath32 if and only if there exists some minimum forcing set of @xmath3 which is connected .",
    "note that observation [ iff_fact ] is not a tautology , since a graph could have minimum forcing sets which are not connected .",
    "in general , it is harder to characterize or even count all distinct minimal forcing sets of a graph than to find its forcing number .",
    "thus , it may be hard to determine whether or not a graph has a minimum forcing set which is connected",
    ".    we can apply observation [ iff_fact ] to some known results about forcing and obtain analogous results about connected forcing .",
    "for example , theorem 3.1 of @xcite states that the forcing number of the hypercube graph @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",
    "since there exists a connected set of size @xmath34 which forces @xmath33  namely a subgraph of @xmath33 isomorphic to @xmath35  we conclude that @xmath36 . as another example ,",
    "theorem 2.4 of @xcite states that the forcing number of the torus graph @xmath37 , @xmath38 , is @xmath39 .",
    "since there exists a connected set of size @xmath39 which forces @xmath37  namely a subgraph of @xmath37 isomorphic to @xmath40  we conclude that @xmath41 .",
    "the same approach can be attempted for other families of graphs whose forcing number has been characterized .",
    "of course , as discussed above , this simple approach will not always work , as demonstrated by later examples in the paper .",
    "since the forcing number of a graph is an upper bound on the maximum nullity and path cover number of the graph ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , observation [ geq_fact ] also yields the following relations .",
    "[ m_obs ] for any connected graph @xmath3 , @xmath42 , and this bound is sharp .",
    "[ p_obs ] for any connected graph @xmath3 , @xmath43 , and this bound is sharp .",
    "observations [ m_obs ] and [ p_obs ] are sharp , e.g. , for paths .",
    "we defer further study of the relations between connected forcing , maximum nullity , and path covers to future work .",
    "our next result shows that the connected forcing number is also an upper bound on the number of leaves in the graph .",
    "note that an analogous relation does not always hold for the forcing number ( see , e.g. , figure 1 , right ) .",
    "[ leaf_prop ] for any connected graph @xmath3 different from a path , @xmath44 , and this bound is sharp .",
    "let @xmath14 be an arbitrary connected forcing set of @xmath3 .",
    "if a vertex forces another vertex at some step in the forcing process , then it can not force a second vertex at a later time , since that would imply it had two uncolored neighbors when it forced for the first time .",
    "thus , each sequence of forces induces a path in @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , for each vertex @xmath45 , there is an induced path @xmath46 with @xmath21 being one of the ends of @xmath46 , and all other vertices of @xmath46 being uncolored at the initial time step .",
    "such a path is called the _ forcing chain _ corresponding to @xmath21 .",
    "each vertex , and in particular each leaf of @xmath3 has to be in some forcing chain .",
    "of course , a chain can not contain more than two leaves , since then it would nt induce a path .",
    "suppose some chain contains two leaves .",
    "then one of these leaves must be in @xmath14 , and every other vertex in the chain must not be in @xmath14 .",
    "in particular , the neighbor of the colored leaf is uncolored .",
    "however , since @xmath3 is not a path , there must be other members of @xmath14 outside of this forcing chain ; thus , @xmath14 is not connected  a contradiction .",
    "thus , each forcing chain can contain at most one leaf .",
    "since each forcing chain contains one element of @xmath14 , it follows that @xmath44 .",
    "this bound is sharp , e.g. , for the graph in figure [ fig2 ] , left .",
    "in contrast to graphs for which @xmath47 , there are also families of graphs for which the connected forcing number can be arbitrarily larger than the forcing number .",
    "we state this more precisely below .    for any @xmath48",
    ", there exists a graph @xmath3 such that @xmath49 .",
    "consider the graph @xmath50 obtained by attaching a pair of pendant vertices to each end of a path @xmath51 .",
    "the forcing number of @xmath50 is 3 , and for @xmath52 its connected forcing number is @xmath53 ; see figure [ fig1 ] for an illustration .        since any minimum connected forcing set contains a forcing set ,",
    "a natural question to ask is whether every graph has some minimum connected forcing set that contains a minimum forcing set .",
    "analogously , one could ask whether a minimum forcing set can be extended to obtain a minimum connected forcing set .",
    "however , the graph in figure [ fig2 ] is a counterexample to both of these questions . in particular",
    ", no subset of any minimum connected forcing set of the graph is a minimum forcing set , and no superset of any minimum forcing set of the graph is a minimum connected forcing set .",
    "we state this formally in observation [ ob_subset ] .",
    "[ ob_subset ] a minimum connected forcing set of a connected graph @xmath3 does not necessarily contain a minimum forcing set of @xmath3 .    an important concept to studying and understanding the forcing process is that of the _ forcing spread _ of a vertex @xmath21",

    "we define the analogous concept of _ connecting forcing spread _ of a vertex @xmath21 as @xmath56 . in this definition ,",
    "we restrict @xmath21 to be a non - articulation point of @xmath3 , since the connected forcing number is undefined for a disconnected graph . with this in mind , we show that unlike the forcing spread , the connected forcing spread of a vertex can be arbitrarily large .    for any @xmath57 and @xmath58 ,",
    "there exist graphs @xmath59 and @xmath60 and vertices @xmath61 and @xmath62 such that @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "consider the graph @xmath65 obtained by appending a pendant vertex to each endpoint of two maximally distant edges of an even cycle @xmath66 .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath72 .",
    "thus , @xmath73 .        in studying the forcing process , it is important is to consider what a single vertex can force .",
    "it is easy to see that a connected forcing set of size 1 can force a graph if and only if the graph is a path .",
