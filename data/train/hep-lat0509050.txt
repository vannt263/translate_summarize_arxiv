    "following previous papers  @xcite in which we computed non - perturbatively the renormalization constants of composite operators with overlap fermions in quenched qcd , this paper will study the scaling behavior of the renormalization constants .",
    "we adopt the non - perturbative renormalization method which was introduced by martinelli @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the method allows a full non - perturbative computation of the matrix elements of composite operators in the regularization independent ( ri ) scheme  @xcite ( it is called the @xmath1 scheme by chetyrkin  @xcite ) .",
    "the matching between the @xmath2 scheme and @xmath3 , which is intrinsically perturbative , is computed using continuum perturbation theory , which is well behaved .",
    "the overlap fermion  @xcite was proposed by narayanan and neuberger to evade the so called  no - go \" theorem  @xcite .",
    "the action in the massless limit preserves a lattice form of chiral symmetry even at finite lattice spacing and volume  @xcite .",
    "the use of the overlap action entails many theoretical advantages : it has no additive mass renormalization , there are no order @xmath4 artifacts , and it has very good scaling  @xcite .",
    "the renormalized operator @xmath5 is related to the bare operator , @xmath6 , calculated on the lattice via @xmath7 in this work , we will consider the fermion operators @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the dirac gamma matrices @xmath10 and the corresponding notations will be \\ { s , v , p , a , t } respectively .",
    "the renormalization condition is imposed directly on the three - point vertex function @xmath11 , which is calculated in a fixed gauge , _",
    "e.g. _ , landau gauge in our case , at a momentum scale @xmath12 @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the field or wave - function renormalization constant , @xmath15 .",
    "it is apparent that we can only get the ratio of the renormalization constant @xmath16 for the operator @xmath17 and the wave - function renormalization constant @xmath18 , from the renormalization condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ren_con ] ) . in order to obtain the renormalization constant @xmath16 for the operator @xmath17",
    ", one needs to know @xmath14 first . in this work ,",
    "we will obtain @xmath14 directly from the quark propagator .",
    "it can be defined from the ward identity ( wi ) as  @xcite @xmath19 which , in landau gauge , differs from @xmath18 by a finite term of order @xmath20 .",
    "the matching coefficients have been computed using continuum perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "we work on three lattices , each with a different lattice spacing , @xmath4 , but having similar physical volume .",
    "lattice parameters are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the quenched gauge configurations are created using a tadpole improved plaquette plus rectangle ( lscher - weisz ) gauge action and gauge fixed to the landau gauge using a conjugate gradient fourier acceleration algorithm .",
    "[ parameter ]    the overlap - dirac operator we use is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is regulator mass and @xmath23 is bare quark mass , and @xmath24 is the matrix sign function of an hermitian operator @xmath25 = @xmath26 .",
    "we use the tadple improved wilson kernel @xmath27 in the overlap operator , and @xmath28 is used for the regulator mass @xmath22 for all three lattices .",
    "we calculate the overlap quark propagator for 15 bare quark masses on three lattices , they are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33,@xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43  mev respectively    our calculation begins with the evaluation of the inverse of the overlap - dirac operator . after we calculate the quark propagator in coordinate space for each configuration , we use the landau gauge fixing transformation matrix to rotate the quark propagator to landau gauge",
    ". then the discrete fourier transformation is used to obtain the quark propagator in momentum space .",
    "afterward , we calculate five projected vertex functions @xmath11 for each bare quark mass , and extrapolate to the chiral limit",
    ". these projected vertex functions @xmath11 are in general dependent on @xmath44 .",
    "the dependence may come from two sources .",
    "one is from the usual running of the renormalization constant in the @xmath2 scheme .",
    "the other is from possible @xmath44 errors and we need to remove this . in order to confront experiment , it is preferable to quote the final results in the @xmath45 scheme at a certain scale .",
    "one needs to transform the results in the @xmath2 scheme to the @xmath45 scheme .",
    "the detailed analysis can be found in refs .",
    "we work on three lattices with similar physical volumes and different spacings @xmath4 to investigate the the scaling behavior of the renormalization constants . here",
    "we compare the results of renormalization constants @xmath18 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 on the different lattices in the @xmath49 scheme at 2.0 gev . fig .  [ fig3lz ] shows the four renormalization constants @xmath18 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 against the square of the lattice spacing @xmath4",
    ". because overlap fermions are free of @xmath50 errors , the leading term must be proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "we use a simple linear fit @xmath16 = @xmath52 + @xmath53 @xmath51 , and take @xmath52 as the value of the renormalization constant @xmath16 in the continuum limit .",
    "the numerical values of calculated renormalization constants in the continuum limit in the @xmath49 and ri schemes at 2.0 gev are displayed in table  2 .         in the continuum ,",
    "the vector current is conserved , so @xmath46 should be equal to one . for the axial vector current , due to the pcac relation",
    ", it will be conserved at large momenta , where the anomaly has no effect .",
    "our result for @xmath46 and @xmath54 in table  2 compares favorably with 1 .",
