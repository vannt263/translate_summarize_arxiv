    "infrared polarimetric studies of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ; where a compact object  a black hole or a neutron star  accretes from a companion star due to roche lobe overflow ) are few and far between . however , such studies can provide information about the physical conditions of the system and inner accretion flow .",
    "most radiation from lmxbs is expected to be unpolarised , for example thermal blackbody radiation from the accretion disc or companion star .",
    "the scattering of unpolarised photons could result in a small degree of net polarisation in certain geometries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there is one emission mechanism present in lmxbs that intrinsically produces polarised light ",
    "synchrotron emission .",
    "it has been known for decades that optically thin synchrotron radiation can produce a high level ( tens of percent ) of linear polarisation if the magnetic field structure is ordered ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "linear polarisation ( lp ) of black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxbs ) is measured at radio frequencies at a level of @xmath103% in a number of sources in an x - ray low / hard state , and up to @xmath11% during transient radio events associated with x - ray state transitions and jet ejections ( for a review see @xcite and see e.g. @xcite and @xcite for the definitions of x - ray states ) .",
    "the radio emission of lmxbs is synchrotron in nature and ubiquitously originates in their collimated jets in both black hole and neutron star systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the high polarisation levels measured in the radio from these optically thin ejections have indicated that @xmath15 may be as large as 0.5 , and have provided clues towards the fundamental jet and magnetic field properties @xcite .    in the low / hard state of bhxbs the radio jet spectrum is optically thick to relatively large distances ( light hours ) from the launch region , with @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this component appears to extend to the infrared regime , where it breaks to an optically thin spectrum , with @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "this optically thin component has also recently been identified in a number of low - mass neutron star x - ray binaries ( nsxbs ) in the infrared @xcite .",
    "the higher frequency photons from the jet are emitted in its inner regions , closest to the compact object ( in the absence of shocks downstream ) . in the optical regime",
    "the reprocessed light from the x - ray illuminated accretion disc usually dominates which , like the optically thick jet , should be no more than @xmath10% polarised . in the frequency range in between , which includes the @xmath18-bands ,",
    "we expect a strong polarised signal from the optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "it is currently uncertain whether the jet component dominates the near - infrared ( nir ) at low luminosities ( quiescence ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in most systems",
    "the companion star comes to dominate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but in some it does not ( e.g. gx 3394 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if the value of @xmath15 is high , a polarised signal from the jet component should be detectable .",
    "higher levels of lp ( typically @xmath19% but up to @xmath20% in ss 433 ) , which are variable , have been detected in the ultraviolet ( uv ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and result from a combination of thompson and rayleigh scattering .    according to theoretical arguments , the signature of the large - scale magnetic field structure at the base of the jet could be inferred via its polarisation signal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "radio polarimetry has shown that in some cases , the magnetic field is fairly ordered in the optically thin transient jet ejections .",
    "when the radio spectrum is optically thick , lp is detected at a level of a few percent .",
    "consequently , if a high level of lp is observed from the low / hard state infrared optically thin spectrum , the magnetic field at the base of the _ steady _ low / hard state jet must also be ordered .",
    "therefore infrared lp is key to understanding the conditions of the inner regions of the steady jet flow .",
    "in addition , the higher frequency infrared photons do not suffer from faraday rotation , which can confuse radio results .    in 2006",
    ", @xcite were the first to report infrared polarimetric observations of lmxbs .",
    "they found no evidence for intrinsic lp in h1743322 in outburst or gro j165540 in quiescence , but did find significant ( at the 2.5@xmath0 level ) lp ( which is probably intrinsic ) in xte j1550564 during a weak x - ray outburst .",
    "no polarised standard star was observed so the authors were unable to calibrate the polarisation position angle ( pa ) , however if the calibration correction is small then pa @xmath21 , which is perpendicular to the known jet axis @xcite .",
    "for optically thin synchrotron emission , the polarisation pa is a measure of the electric vector , which is perpendicular to the magnetic field vector .",
    "therefore in xte j1550564 the magnetic field may be parallel to the jet .",
    "very recently , @xcite performed infrared spectropolarimetry of three lmxbs and found two of them ( the nsxbs sco x1 and cyg x2 ) to be intrinsically polarised , with an increasing lp at lower frequencies .",
    "they interpret this as the first detection of the polarised inner regions of the jets .    in the optical regime of lmxbs ,",
    "just two sources ( a062000 and gro j165540 ) possess intrinsic lp to our knowledge @xcite .",
    "the lp varies as a function of orbital phase and is likely caused by the scattering of intrinsically unpolarised thermal emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "no intrinsic lp has been detected from optical observations of nsxbs , except for tentatively in aql x1 @xcite .",
    "we note that polarimetric observations of jets from active galactic nuclei ( agn ; which are resolved and are of course orders of magnitude larger and more powerful than x - ray binary jets ) have revealed a strong link between the local magnetic field and the dynamics of the jet .",

    ", we have obtained linear polarimetric observations of eight x - ray binaries using the 8 m very large telescope ( vlt ) and the 3.8 m united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) in order to constrain the origin of the emission and the level of ordering of the jet magnetic field .",

    "the results are discussed in detail in section 3 and in section 5 we summarise our results .",
    "in an effort to identify the polarised signature of jets in the infrared , we first selected the best suited sources and telescopes . the evidence for optically thin emission from the jet in the nir ( and hence our best chance of detecting high levels of lp ) comes mainly from bhxbs in outburst in the low / hard state ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and low - magnetic field nsxbs that are active @xcite .",
    "however it has been proposed that the jet may also contribute or dominate the nir flux in some quiescent bhxbs @xcite but probably not in quiescent nsxbs @xcite .",

    "the s / n was low in our nir observations and we can place 3@xmath0 upper limits of lp @xmath54 5% , 17% and 12% in @xmath7 , @xmath3 and @xmath6 , respectively ( the aperture includes a very close contaminating star which appears to contribute about half the flux in @xmath6 ; star @xmath90 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our observations span three epochs , the first of which was at the end of a small outburst @xcite .",
    "indeed , we derive @xmath18 magnitudes which are consistent with those found in quiescence by @xcite except on our first epoch ( 20 aug 2006 ) , where @xmath7 and @xmath6 are 0.20@xmath530.15 and 0.27@xmath530.16 magnitudes brighter than the mean quiescent values . on this date ,",
    "the @xmath7@xmath6 de - reddened sed is blue ( column vi of table 4 ) implying the emission is from the disc , although the contaminating star will affect this measurement .",
    "the disc and donor star are expected to dominate the optical / nir light in quiescence , but during outburst the contributions vary .",
    "a dramatic reddening of the optical sed was seen at the peak of the bright 1978 outburst of aql x1 @xcite which could be explained by the domination of the jet component @xcite .",
    "however the jet is likely to contribute very little to the optical / nir light in quiescence .",
    "* ss 433 * : high levels of lp have been detected in this high - mass x - ray binary in the optical and uv , which can be explained by a combination of thompson and rayleigh scattering @xcite . in the lower panel of fig .",
    "4 we show the polarisation spectrum of ss 433 with our two @xmath7-band measurements , the optical / uv data and a @xmath6-band upper limit from @xcite .",
    "our data follow the general trend of decreasing lp with decreasing frequency , so we expect the origin is the same as in the optical .",
    "however the pas differ between the @xmath7-band ( @xmath91 during two epochs ) and the optical ( @xmath92 ) , which could be explained by an interstellar contribution at these low levels of lp ( the extinction is high ; see table 2 ) .",
    "many phenomena could result in polarised nir emission from lmxbs .",
    "here we discuss the likely causes of lp and use the gro j165540 and sco x1 results to constrain the origin of the polarisation . *",
    "thompson or rayleigh scattering * : scattering of light within the system can result in detectable lp ( see section 1 ) ; the optical light from a062000 and gro j165540 is polarised in this way at a level of a few percent @xcite .",
    "however , lp due to scattering is expected to decrease as a function of increasing wavelength and not be more than a few percent in the infrared @xcite .",
    "the 56% we measure for gro j165540 therefore can not be explained by local scattering , and in both this source and sco x1 the transient nir lp is greater than the optical lp . in high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs )",
    "the scattering of stellar light can produce lp ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in sco",
    "x1 this can not be the case as the accretion disc dominates the optical and nir and as such any polarised stellar light would be diluted by the light from the disc @xcite .",
    "for gro j165540 the star is large and bright and peaks in the optical @xcite but the high level of nir lp and the negative relation between lp and frequency allow us to rule out scattered stellar light as the origin of the nir lp .    scattering also produces lp that is variable on timescales of the orbital period ; this has been significantly detected from optical observations of both hmxbs and lmxbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , fig .",
    "5 shows that the amplitude of the nir polarisation of sco x1 varies dramatically between three consecutive observations on the same date ( within 30 minutes ) , which is very different from the 18.9 hour orbital period of sco x1 .",
    "the combination of these lines of evidence strongly indicates we can rule out scattering as the origin to the transient lp in both gro j165540 and sco x1 . * the scattering of jets on the companion star surface * : if the jet does not escape the system at an angle approximately perpendicular to the plane of the disc , lp may be caused by direct interaction between the jet plasma and the companion star surface .",
    "in lmxbs however , the companion typically occupies @xmath93% of the solid angle as seen from the compact object ( e.g. see fig",
    ". 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "in this case , a jet colliding with the star requires either a jet opening angle of @xmath57 ( which contradicts the morphology of the resolved radio jets in both sources ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or would have to be directed towards the companion at an angle away from the disc of @xmath94 , as opposed to the more likely @xmath95 .",
    "the two nir lp detections of gro j165540 are different in orbital phase by 0.3 ( they are 14.0 days apart and the orbital period is 2.62 days ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in sco x1 the transient lp is measured at many orbital phases ( table 4 ) , so this latter scenario can be ruled out . *",
    "synchrotron emission from the inner regions of the jets * : optically thin synchrotron emission is the only process in lmxbs capable of producing nir lp of levels greater than a few percent and can , depending on the structure of the magnetic field , produce tens of percent of lp . in both sources ,",
    "the jet is known to become dominant at wavelengths just longer than the nir @xcite so light from the jet is known to contribute significantly at nir wavelengths ( we constrain the level of jet contribution for gro j165540 in section 3.1 ) .",
    "optically thin synchrotron emission is the only mechanism in our systems capable of producing the high level of nir lp in gro j165540 since we have ruled out local scattering .",
    "in addition , synchrotron emission ( both optically thick and thin ) is likely the only process that can account for the fast flickering of lp in sco x1 .",
    "@xcite also rule out alternative origins to the nir lp in sco x1 .",
    "moreover , we would expect lp from the jet component to be weaker at shorter wavelengths , as is observed in both sources , since the disc ( of sco x1 ) and companion star ( of gro j165540 ) are much more luminous than the jet at shorter wavelengths .    from the lines of evidence in this section",
    ", we can conclude with confidence that the origin of the lp in these two sources is very likely synchrotron emission from the inner regions of the jets .",
    "we have presented linear polarimetric observations of seven x - ray binaries in the nir regime and one in the optical .",
    "in one black hole system and one neutron star system ( gro j165540 and sco x1 ) , intrinsic lp is detected at the @xmath1 level , which is stronger at lower frequencies .",
    "we discuss possible origins of the lp and conclude that it is very likely the signature of nir synchrotron emission from their jets , which must reside in partially - ordered magnetic fields .",
    "we rule out scattering within the system as the origin of the lp .",
    "the intrinsic lp in sco x1 is at a comparable level to that measured recently by @xcite , but we find it is also highly variable in @xmath3 and @xmath6-bands ; sometimes it is absent",
    ". the variability could be due to changes in either the jet magnetic field structure or the jet power and luminosity .",
    "ss 433 also possesses intrinsic nir lp which is likely due to local scattering .",
    "the optical light from gx 3394 is polarised , almost certainly due to interstellar dust .",
    "we have been able to constrain @xmath15 , the dimensionless parameter representing the ordering of the magnetic field in the region of the jets , in two sources . in the bhxb gro j165540 , @xmath69 whereas in the nsxb 4u 0614 + 09 , @xmath77 .",
    "the bhxb result is consistent with those found from radio studies of the transient jet ejections in bhxbs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and multi - wavelength studies of jets in agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the inner regions of steady jets from bhxbs may have a similar magnetic field configuration to the brighter , transient jets .",
    "a dramatic change in pa in gro j165540 at the end of its outbursts ( also seen in the radio ) suggests the magnetic field structure may change at low jet powers , and/or the polarisation may originate from a different region of the jet at these later times .",
    "for nsxbs , this is the first time a constraint on @xmath15 has been made ( none exist from radio observations ) .",
    "the non - detection of polarisation in any of our low - luminosity sources suggests either the jet contribution is insignificant or the magnetic field is not well - ordered .",
    "we have demonstrated that polarimetry is a powerful tool to constrain the conditions in the inner regions of the jets in x - ray binaries .",
    "the nir region of the spectrum of lmxbs is usually dominated by optically thin synchrotron emission from the jets , at least in outburst in the hard state ( e.g. russell et al . 2006 ; 2007 ) .",
    "future polarimetric studies may reveal changes in the conditions as a function of jet power ( i.e. jet luminosity ) and differences between object types ( black hole or neutron star systems ) .",
    "in particular , the bhxb gx 3394 undergoes quasi - regular outbursts with a bright nir jet ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in quiescence ,",
    "a positive polarisation detection from the jet will indicate its contribution is significant ( supporting jet - dominated scenarios ) , and therefore some estimates of the mass function , which often do not consider jet contributions , may be inaccurate .    _",
    "we thank tariq shahbaz for copies of his paper @xcite prior to publication . in particular",
