    "image denoising as a fundamental problem in image restoration has been extensively studied in image processing and computer vision ( see [ 1]-[12 ] for few various representative works ) . in this paper , we address the problem of image restoration from _ mixed gaussian - impulse noise _ data .",
    "suppose the clean image @xmath0 is corrupted by both additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) of @xmath1 ( with variance @xmath2 ) and an impulse noise . also , let @xmath3 represent the process of image degradation with impulse noise .",
    "accordingly , the overall degradation by mixed gaussian - impulse noise can be modeled as the following : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the observed image ( noisy measurements ) . in the literature , there are two common types of impulse noise : salt - and - pepper ( sp ) noise and random - valued ( rv ) noise .",
    "let denote @xmath6 as the pixel value of image @xmath7 at location @xmath8 , and @xmath9 $ ] be the dynamic range of @xmath7 .",
    "the operator @xmath10 is defined as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are in the range of @xmath9 $ ] and independent from @xmath6 . when @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the model is sp noise ; however , if @xmath16 is identically and uniformly distributed random numbers in @xmath9 $ ] with probability @xmath17 , the model is called rv noise .",
    "median - type filters , e.g. adaptive median filter ( amf ) [ 13 ] and adaptive center - weighted median filter ( acwmf ) [ 14 ] , are widely used in the literature to remove impulse noise .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the set of locations of noisy pixel candidates corrupted by impulse noise , and accordingly , the set of pixels that are likely to be uncorrupted by impulse noise is defined as @xmath19 . therefore",
    ", the degradation matrix @xmath20 can be defined as @xmath21 . ,",
    "[ 7]-[12 ] and for the sake of a fair comparison , @xmath20 is determined by amf and acwmf for sp and rv noise detection , respectively . ]",
    "more precisely , the pixels probably being corrupted by impulse noise are assigned with @xmath22 while the rest of pixel values are more likely to be corrupted by awgn .",
    "delving further into this issue reveals this fact that , @xmath23 follows an approximate gaussian distribution , where @xmath24 denotes the element - wise multiplication between two matrices .",
    "also , due to the _ ill - posed _ nature of ( 1 ) , regularization - based methods are often used to convert ( 1 ) into a _",
    "well - posed _",
    "problem by imposing _ a priori _ information of the underlying signal [ 7 ] , [ 9]-[12 ] .",
    "hence , from the bayesian inference , the following regularization - based framework for mixed gaussian - impulse noise removal is written as : @xmath25 where the first term is a penalty that represents the closeness of the solution to the observed scene ; the second term is a regularization term which represents a priori information of the original scene ; and @xmath26 is a regularization parameter that balances the contribution of both terms .",
    "the term @xmath27 could be various choices , e.g. , tikhonov regularization [ 15 ] , geman and reynolds half quadratic variational model [ 16 ] , rudin , osher and fatemi s total variation model [ 17 ] , mumford - shah model [ 18 ] , and framelet based model [ 7 ] . these approaches do not need to find the damaged pixels and perform well in impulse noise removal .",
    "however , for the case of images corrupted by mixed gaussian impulse noise , the gaussian noise is not treated properly [ 12 ] . in recent works , the local smoothness and the nonlocal self - similarity properties ( or image sparsity prior ) exhibited in natural images",
    "are combined into the final cost functional of image restoration solution to achieve better performance , e.g. , see [ 10]-[12 ] .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are listed as follows .",
    "first , we propose an _ adaptive curvelet thresholding _ ( act ) criterion , in a statistical manner , for adaptively characterizing the perturbations appeared during noise removal process  exploiting local consistency .",
    "second , we establish a new statistical regularization term , called _ joint adaptive statistical prior _ ( jasp ) which enforces both the local and nonlocal statistical consistencies , simultaneously , in a unified manner .",
    "third , we propose a novel technique for mixed gaussian plus impulse noise removal using jasp in a variational scheme , we refer to it as de - jasp . to solve the above variational scheme ,",
    "an efficient alternating minimization algorithm is developed based on split bregman iterative framework [ 19 ] .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii provides a brief background on a recently proposed modeling for nonlocal self - similarity .",
    "the proposed act is introduced in section iii .",
    "the proposed regularization term , along with its incorporation into the variational framework of mixed noise removal , and implementation details are introduced in section iv .",
    "numerical results are given in section v and finally , section vi concludes the paper .",
    "motivated by the success of bm3d [ 4 ] in image denoising , zhang _",
    "et al_. [ 11 ] proposed a model for nonlocal self - similarity prior information , which is employed efficiently in image restoration .",
    "the nlsm explores the nonlocal self - similarity by means of the distribution of the transform coefficients , which are obtained by transforming the 3d array generated by stacking similar image patches . to elucidate on , first",
    ", the image @xmath7 ( of size @xmath28 ) is divided into @xmath29 overlapped patches of equal sizes , i.e. , @xmath30 ( of size @xmath31 ) at location @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "then , for each patch the best @xmath34 matched patches are found within a searching window ( of size @xmath35 ) .",
    "next , these similar patches are stacked into a 3d array , @xmath36 , which is called a group .",
    "now , a 3d transform , @xmath37 , is conducted on the group to obtain its transform coefficients , followed by arranging them in a lexicographic order .",
    "the mathematical formulation of the nlsm for self - similarity in transform domain can be written as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 corresponds to the nlsm operator . to put it simply and briefly , after obtaining @xmath40 ,",
    "the new estimate of @xmath7 is achieved by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 corresponds the inverse operator of @xmath43 .",
    "the curvelet transform [ 20 ] is a multi - scale directional transform which provides a new multi - resolution representation with several features that are superior to existing representation , i.e. , wavelets and steerable pyramids , thereby gaining good performance in image denoising [ 1 ] , [ 21 ] . for these reasons , here , an adaptive denoising / shrinkage procedure in curvelet domain via estimation of clean curvelet coefficients from available rough estimated data is proposed    we assume that the initially estimated image @xmath44 achieved by the median filter ( amf or acwmf ) is perturbed and model that perturbation by additive noise , with no prejudging on being awgn or any specific species of noise . to elucidate on",
    ", this modeling of perturbations by additive noise helps us to model the noise probability density function ( pdf ) effectively and being able to solve the ensuing optimization problem efficiently .",
    "suppose , the initiated image coefficients in curvelet domain ( @xmath45 ) , and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the curvelet coefficient of function @xmath7 , @xmath48 is a forward curvelet transform and @xmath49 is its moore - penrose pseudo - inverse transform ( corresponding to the minimal dual synthesis frame ) . due to the parseval tight frame property of curvelet transform ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) , we have @xmath51 .",
    "] can be written as : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the initiated image curvelet coefficient ( available rough coefficient which is assumed to be noisy ) and the noise - free ( or clean ) curvelet coefficients , respectively , and @xmath55 is unknown additive noise ( or _ perturbation _ ) vector .",
    "also , the three indices of @xmath56 are curvelet triple index of _ scale _ , _ rotation _ and _ position _ , respectively .",
    "the problem of image denoising in curvelet domain can be expressed as estimation of clean coefficients from noisy data with bayesian estimation techniques .",
    "either minimum mean - squared error ( mmse ) or maximum _ a posteriori _ ( map ) estimator is used for solving this problem , the solution requires a prior knowledge about the distribution of curvelet coefficients .",
    "more specifically , these methods are optimized w.r.t .",
    "the marginal statistics of the coefficients within each sub - band , by imposing a prior distribution on the clean transform coefficients [ 6 ] .    figs .",
    "1(a)-1(b ) show the histograms of two successive orientations at one scale of the curvelet coefficients of the clean image  fence \" ( @xmath57)see fig .",
    "obviously , it can be observed that the distributions are characterized by a very sharp peak at zero amplitude and extended tails to both sides of the peak ( _ leptokurtic distribution _ ) .",
    "this leptokurtic property is observed in all histograms of each scale and orientation of all test images . in this paper , laplacian distribution",
    "is chosen to model the marginal distributions of curvelet coefficients of the clean image , i.e. , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the standard deviation of clean coefficients .",
    "this choice is despite the fact that marginal distributions of curvelet coefficients have significantly heavier tails than a laplacian distribution ; tend to go zero slower than a gaussian distribution ; and can be well modelled by a hyper - laplacian distribution .",
    "but , actually , this choice makes a trade - off between modeling the coefficients statistics accurately and being able to solve the ensuing optimization problem efficiently .",
    "the histograms of the same two successive orientations at the same scale of the coefficients of the initially estimated image @xmath44see fig . 2 ( c)are shown in figs .",
    "1(c)-1(d ) .",
    "more specifically , these histograms are obtained using the curvelet coefficients of the initiated image @xmath44 , which is achieved by the initial median filtering step . as can be seen , here ,",
    "the leptokurtic behavior and heavy tails do not exist in the shown distributions .",
    "more accurately , these two properties do not exist in all distributions of each scale and orientation of all initiated images achieved by this step .    considering ( 5 ) , the noise distribution can be obtained using the curvelet coefficients of the clean image and the initiated image .",
    "1(e)-1(f ) show the pdfs of noise distribution at the same two successive orientations of the same scale corresponding to those of figs .",
    "1(a)-1(d ) .",
    "it can be observed that the empirical distributions of noise coefficients @xmath60 can be well characterized by gaussian distributions , while the laplacian distributions have much larger fitting errors .",
    "this observation motivates us to model the pdf of @xmath60 by a standard gaussian distribution : @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the noise variance in curvelet domain , which can be estimated using robust median estimator [ 22 ] and monte - carlo simulations [ 20 ] .",
    "+    consider the marginal distribution of the clean curvelet coefficients .",
    "since in image denoising problems , we do not have access to the clean image , the variance of the clean image curvelet coefficients @xmath63 can be estimated by _ maximum likelihood _ ( ml ) estimator , through averaging over the neighboring initiated image coefficients ( available @xmath64 ) within a squared window [ 23 ] .    in order to estimate @xmath65 from the available observation @xmath66 , the map estimator",
    "is employed : @xmath67 by considering ( 5 ) and using bayes rule , we get : @xmath68 therefore , ( 7 ) allows us to write this estimation in terms of the pdf of the noise coefficient ( @xmath69 ) , and the pdf of the clean image coefficient ( @xmath70 ) . by substituting @xmath69 and @xmath70 into ( 7 ) and doing some manipulations , the estimation of @xmath71",
    "is achieved as : @xmath72 where , in fact , ( 8) is the classical soft shrinkage function [ 24 ] defined as @xmath73 .",
    "not only can the proposed act applied for the initiated image achieved by the initial median filtering step , but also it can be employed in further iterations  by using the last approximated image achieved in previous iteration as the noisy image for the current iteration  which leads to a simple and effective mixed gaussian - impulse noise removal scheme , e.g. , see fig .",
    "the proposed _ joint adaptive statistical prior _ ( jasp ) is defined by integrating both the local information prior ( which depicts the local smoothness and geometric regularity of image structures achieved by discrete curvelet transform ( dcut ) [ 20 ] ) and the nonlocal self - similarity prior ( corresponding to the nlsm in 3d transform domain achieved by the method introduced in section ii ) . in a mathematical expression ,",
    "the proposed jasp is expressed as : @xmath74 where the first and the second terms represent the image local smoothness prior and nonlocal self - similarity prior , respectively . also , @xmath75 is a regularization parameter which controls the trade - off between two competing ( statistical ) terms .    by substituting the proposed jasp ( 9 ) for the regularization term @xmath27 in the regularization - based framework of ( 3 ) , and by introducing two auxiliary variables",
    "@xmath47 and @xmath76 , the proposed optimization problem for image recovery is expressed as follow : @xmath77 in order to solve the above minimization problem , an alternating split bregman iterative algorithm [ 19 ] is invoked .",
    "we finally obtain the following schemes :    [ eq : subeqns ] @xmath78    here , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are fixed value parameters for improving the numerical stability of the algorithm .    given @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the @xmath7 _ sub - problem _ of ( 11a )",
    "consists of minimizing a strictly convex quadratic function that can be solved easily , i.e. , @xmath83 , where @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in order to avoid computing the matrix inversion in the first term , the matrix inversion lemma of the sherman - morrison formula",
    "is applied to that term .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 _ sub - problem _ can be obtained as : @xmath86    by given @xmath7 in hand ( according to ( 12 ) ) and considering @xmath87 ( for simplicity , the superscript @xmath88 is dropped without confusion ) , the @xmath47 _ sub - problem _ of ( 11a ) becomes : @xmath89 by these transformations , we regard @xmath90 as some type of the noisy unknown coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "more precisely , the sub - problem of ( 13 ) can be interpreted as the denoising in curvelet coefficient domain .",
    "considering the fact that the unknown variable @xmath47 is component - wise separable in curvelet domain , each of its component @xmath91 can be obtained by a component - wise shrinkage procedure : @xmath92 where its solution is the same as the one introduced in ( 8) with regarding @xmath93 . to elucidate on , the @xmath47 _ sub - problem _ of ( 13 )",
    "can be interpreted as the proposed act introduced in section iii .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath26 is self - adaptive .    given @xmath7 , analogously , the @xmath76 _ sub - problem _ of ( 11a ) can be written as : @xmath94 where @xmath95 ( for simplicity the superscript @xmath88 is omitted without confusion ) .",
    "owing to the complicated definition of @xmath96 , it seems difficult to solve ( 15 ) directly . in order to solve ( 15 ) amenable , according to [ 11 ] , a reasonable assumption is used which leads to obtain a closed - form solution of ( 15 ) . by assuming that all elements of @xmath97 ( such that @xmath98 ) are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) with zero - mean and variance @xmath99 , and by invoking the _ law of large numbers _ in probability theory , for any @xmath100 , it leads to : @xmath101     +   + [ table_example ]    [ cols= \" < \" , ]",
    "table ii lists the psnr and ssim values of the recovered noisy test images obtained by the proposed de - jasp compared to those obtained by jsm and ifasda in different noise level hypotheses ( best results are emphasized in bold face ) . from table ii",
    ", it can be inferred that the performance of the proposed de - jasp is superior to those of compared algorithms in terms of both employed objective quality assessors .",
    "the average psnr ( ssim ) gain of de - jasp over jsm and ifasda , in mixed _",
    "awgn+rv _ noise removal , can be up to 2.31 db ( 0.154 ) and 3.55 db ( 0.167 ) , respectively . for visual comparison ,",
    "some recovered images by the competing methods , in different noise levels , are shown in figs .",
    "it can be observed that de - jasp outperforms the other competing methods and reproducing clearer images .",
    "better visual comparison can be made by zooming the images on the screen .",

    "in this paper , first , an adaptive curvelet thresholding ( act ) criterion is introduced to adaptively characterize and abate the perturbations which are appeared during denoising process .",
