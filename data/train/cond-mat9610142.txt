    "the behavior of strongly correlated electronic systems remains a central problem in contemporary condensed matter physics .",
    "several years of intense studies have made it clear that the necessary theoretical skills and tools to deal with strongly correlated fermion systems are lacking ( see e.g.  the recent reviews by dagatto@xcite and lieb @xcite ) .",
    "many exotic schemes have been invented to accommodate a suitable theoretical framework , but the development of a predictive general theory does not seem to be in sight . in this state of affairs the importance of performing numerical calculations of the ground state properties and the energy spectrum of a given many - body hamiltonian has grown .",
    "computational results can lead to the acceptance or rejection of the proposed analytical models , and they can guide the development of new analytical approaches .    in the hubbard model and related models",
    "one important parameter is the filling @xmath5 .",
    "much work has been devoted to the high density case near half filling , since it is believed to be relevant for high - temperature superconductivity @xcite , but also the low filling regime is of interest , e.g.  it plays an important role in theoretical studies of the breakdown of fermi liquid theory in 2d @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a numerical study of the two - dimensional hubbard model at low filling regime @xmath6 , a regime where the calculation is tractable .",
    "it is natural to choose four particles as a generic case close to the simple two - particle case .",
    "the coupling strength is used as a perturbation parameter , and we address the question of universality in the response of strongly correlated electron systems to this perturbation @xcite .",
    "we describe an efficient method which allows for numerical calculations of the exact energy spectrum .",
    "this method can relatively easily be extended to calculations of various green s functions and spectral functions well suited for the study of low lying excitations and the corresponding coherent part of the spectral densities , a topic we will study in forthcoming work . here , we rather study the statistical properties of the typical high energy excitations which is related to the incoherent background of the typical spectral functions . more specifically",
    ", we study the statistical properties of the spectra within the framework of random matrix theory ( rmt ) .",
    "rmt was developed for the study of neutron scattering resonances in nuclear physics in the fifties and sixties@xcite , but it has since been applied to a wide range of problems in many areas of physics @xcite ( e.g.  studies of conduction fluctuations@xcite , microwave eigenmodes @xcite , and acoustical properties of solids@xcite ) and mathematics ( e.g.  studies of the distribution of the zeros of the riemann zeta function@xcite ) .",
    "moreover , rmt has also been applied to various types of matrix ensembles like hamiltonian matrices@xcite ( as in our case ) , scattering matrices @xcite , as well as transfer matrices@xcite and glauber matrices@xcite of statistical mechanics models .",
    "recently , rmt has been employed in the study of strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "examples are studies of the 2d @xmath7-model@xcite , 2d tight - binding models @xcite , the 1d bethe chain@xcite , and the 1d luttinger liquid@xcite .",
    "the work presented here with emphasis on mathematical and numerical methods is an extension of this line of research .",
    "preliminary results of our work have been published elsewhere@xcite .",
    "there are basically two ways of applying rmt .",
    "one way is to model a relevant matrix of the given physical system with a matrix drawn from a suitable random matrix ensemble and subsequently calculate average properties of the system by averaging over the random matrix ensemble according to rmt . the other way , which we employ here , consists simply of characterizing the spectrum of a given physical system by comparing various statistical properties of the spectrum with the corresponding properties calculated within one of the few universal statistical matrix ensembles of rmt . which of these ensembles describing properly a physical situation depends on the symmetries of the system .",
    "the given spectrum which one analyzes is of course deterministic , but statistical properties are given to it by considering quantities like for example the distribution of the energy spacings where all but one of the spectral variables have been integrated out .",
    "this is like pseudo - random number generators which are perfectly deterministic and nevertheless have many properties in common with random sequences .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the hubbard model and the corresponding hilbert space . in sec .",
    "iii we introduce the rmt quantities used in the characterization of the spectra , and we discuss in detail the special spectral unfolding technique necessitated by the intricate nature of the hubbard spectra . in sec .",
    "iv the entire symmetry group consisting of space , spin and pseudospin symmetry of the model is studied , and all the corresponding projection operators are calculated . in sec .",
    "v the model is diagonalized numerically and we study the raw spectrum , in particular the ground state and some unexpected remaining degeneracies higher in the spectrum . in sec .",
    "vi we present the result of the spectral statistics analysis of the model , and finally , in sec .",
    "vii we discuss the results and conclude .",
    "appendices a  -  d contain mathematical details .",
    "throughout this paper we study the simple one - band @xmath0 square lattice hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions containing a nearest - neighbor hopping term -@xmath8 and an on - site interaction term @xmath9 :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the creation operator and the number operator , respectively , for an electron on site @xmath13 with spin @xmath14 .",
    "no disorder is present in the model .",
    "below half filling the dimension @xmath15 of the hilbert space grows rapidly as a function of @xmath16 and the number @xmath17 of electrons occupying the lattice , so we have confined ourselves to the low filling case of only four electrons , whereas we let @xmath16 vary . moreover , without loss of generality we always work in the sector where the @xmath18 component @xmath19 of the total spin is zero ; the other @xmath19 sectors can be reached by use of the spin ladder operators @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath19=0 sector is the largest of the spin sectors , and it has @xmath22 ^ 2 $ ] which for @xmath16 = 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 , the lattice sizes studied here , yields 1296 , 14400 , 90000 and 396900 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding fillings @xmath23 are 0.22 , 0.13 , 0.08 , and 0.06 .    in the occupation number basis",
    "we label the states as follows @xcite , where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are two lattice sites occupied with spin - up electrons and @xmath26 and @xmath27 with spin - down electrons :    @xmath28 . in our work",
    "we make sure that @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and we have ordered the basis states such that the state @xmath31 comes before the state @xmath32 if @xmath33 , where @xmath13 is the first position encountered where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are different . if during a calculation a state is encountered with @xmath36 and/or @xmath37 , the necessary exchange operations including sign changes are performed to restore it .",
    "finally we note , that for even @xmath16 a bi - partition of the lattice is possible .",
    "a given lattice site @xmath24 can be identified by a set of cartesian coordinates @xmath38 simply counting the position in the lattice ( thus e.g. site @xmath39 and @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig:4x4and5x5]a ) .",
    "each site @xmath24 can then be assigned with a sign @xmath41 , where @xmath42 .",
    "within random matrix theory ( rmt ) one can study several statistical ensembles of matrices .",
    "three important examples are the diagonal ensembles , the gaussian ensembles for hermitian matrices as e.g.hamiltonians , and the circular ensembles for unitary matrices as e.g.scattering matrices . since a main object of this work is to characterize the spectrum of the hubbard model within the framework of rmt , we are led to use the diagonal and the gaussian ensembles of square matrices .",
    "the first ensemble is the ensemble of diagonal matrices @xmath43 with statistically independent diagonal elements @xmath44 drawn from the same distribution @xmath45 .",
    "this ensemble describes situations where the eigenvalues are essentially independent , which empirically has been found to be the case for integrable models .",
    "one characteristic feature of such systems is a `` soft '' spectrum with large probabilities of having levels close together described by the poisson ( exponential ) distribution .",
    "the three others ensembles  denoted the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) , gaussian unitary ensemble ( gue ) , and gaussian symplectic ensemble ( gse )  are defined by requirering statistical independence of the matrix elements of a matrix @xmath46 and invariance of the probability distribution @xmath47 in matrix space under one of the three canonical similarity transformations , the orthogonal , the unitary , and the symplectic transformation respectively@xcite . which ensemble to choose depends on the symmetry of the system .",
    "in fact , the ensembles are universal in the sense that no details of the physical system plays any role , only knowledge of the global symmetry is needed .",
    "the three gaussian ensembles are found to describe situations of very complex or chaotic systems , and one characteristic feature of such systems is a `` rigid '' spectrum with eigenvalue repulsion . in this work",
    "we need only to treat goe , which is found for systems with preserved time - reversal symmetry .",
    "to perform a meaningful rmt analysis one has to sort the spectrum in symmetry sectors corresponding to the symmetry group of the hamiltonian since the symmetry invariant subspaces are orthogonal to one another .",
    "each such symmetry invariant subspace is characterized by a specific set of quantum numbers , and the rmt analysis is performed on sets of eigenlevels having the same quantum numbers . in sec .",
    "[ sec : grouptheory ] we treat the complete symmetry group of the hubbard model and calculate the corresponding projection operators of the symmetry invariant subspaces . as illustrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectralstat ] significant errors are introduced in the analysis if some of the symmetries are neglected .",
    "another caveat in the rmt analysis of finite spectra is the notion of mixed phase space . as a function of some external parameter",
    "a given system can be driven from integrability ( the diagonal ensemble ) to chaos ( one of the gaussian ensembles ) or from one type of symmetry ( say goe ) to another ( say gue ) .",
    "if the spectrum of such a system is studied in the middle of the transition the spectrum is a mixture of two or more components each described by one of the random ensembles @xcite . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "usually only one component survives , but for finite spectra this mixing calls for a further sorting of the spectrum within each symmetry invariant subspace . for",
    "the hubbard model using the coupling strength @xmath48 as the external parameter such a situation does in fact arise as the analysis presented in sec .",
    "[ subsec : remaindeg ] shows .    when the necessary",
    "sorting of the spectrum has been performed the rmt analysis can begin .",
    "the first step is to unfold the spectrum .",
    "naturally , it is necessary to make some kind of transformation or normalization of the spectrum of any given physical system to be able to make comparisons with the universal and dimensionless results of rmt .",
    "this operation is called the unfolding . by local rescaling of the spectrum with the local average level spacing the unfolding",
    "transforms the actual energies @xmath49 into dimensionless `` unfolded energies '' @xmath50 with a local density of one .",
    "thus , by unfolding one subtracts the regular slowly varying part of the spectrum and consider only the fluctuations .",
    "it amounts to compute from the actual integrated density of states @xmath51 , @xmath52 an averaged integrated density of state @xmath53 .",
    "the unfolded energies @xmath50 are then given by    @xmath54    the notions of `` local density '' and `` averaged density '' are not mathematically rigorous .",
    "for some systems there exists natural unfolding procedures .",
    "for example , it is a rigorous result that the density of states for a @xmath55 random matrix approaches a semi - circular form for @xmath56 , thus for any given finite random matrix one simply uses the limiting density of states as the average density . in billiard systems",
    "one can make a laurent series expansion in @xmath57 of @xmath51 and obtain the weyl law for @xmath53 by truncating the series after a finite number of terms , each of which has a physical interpretation . in our case ,",
    "no such natural choices exist for @xmath53 .",
    "we have therefore used several methods to unfold the spectra .",
    "each of these methods has a free parameter , but there is no unique prescription of how to choose it .",
    "the best criterion is the insensitivity of the final result to the method employed and to reasonable variations of the free parameter .",
    "the first method is polynomial interpolation",
    ". it can be a simple linear interpolation or running average where @xmath58 is found as a linear fit of @xmath51 in an interval containing @xmath59 levels on each side of the level @xmath49 ; the free parameter is then the parameter @xmath59 .",
    "it can also be higher order polynomial interpolation , e.g.  in the form of interpolating between several linear interpolations  a method we used in our work on statistical mechanics models @xcite .",
    "the second method @xcite defines @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the @xmath62th smallest spacing to @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath63 becomes the free parameter .",
    "this method works also for complex eigenvalues of non - hermitian matrices .",
    "the third method is fourier broadening of the step - functions @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : idos ] ) .",
    "the fourier transforms from the energy domain to the time domain of the step - functions are found . in the following back - transformation yielding @xmath53 only the slow time components are kept .",
    "choosing a cut - off @xmath65 beyond which all fourier components are set to zero yields @xmath66/\\pi - { \\rm si}[(e - e^*+e_i)\\tau]/\\pi$ ] , where @xmath67 is the sine integral and @xmath68 is an energy slightly larger than the largest energy in the spectrum to be unfolded .",
    "the free parameter is @xmath65 , and by choosing @xmath69 to be of the order of the mean - level spacing a good @xmath53 is obtained .",
    "the fourth method is gaussian broadening of the delta - functions @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : idos ] ) leading to the following expression for @xmath53 :    @xmath71 \\,de.\\ ] ]    the standard deviation or width @xmath72 of the gaussians can be taken as a constant for the entire spectrum ; it is then the free parameter .",
    "however , due to the appearance of many mini - bands in the hubbard spectrum for small values of @xmath48 each having different densities it is desirable to let @xmath72 adapt to local variations in the spectrum .",
    "we have developed the following algorithm : take @xmath73 levels to each side of level @xmath13 , determine the local average level spacing @xmath74 , and set @xmath75 . by this assignment 90% of the weight of",
    "the broadened peak falls in the interval @xmath76 $ ] and @xmath73 becomes the free parameter .",
    "if a gap ( defined as a very atypical spacing ) falls within the chosen range we only take the states of the same side of the gap as @xmath49 into account .",
    "the procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : gauss ] .",
    "we discuss how to optimize the choice of @xmath73 in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectralstat ] .",
    "typically , we find @xmath77 to be a good choice .",
    "all four methods of unfolding yield essentially the same results .",
    "we decided to use the gaussian broadening with varying width , eq .",
    "( [ eq : idosaver ] ) , since it was better suited to the study of the hubbard spectra with its many mini - bands at small coupling strength @xmath48 ( see sec.[subsec : spectrum ] ) .",
    "a final remark on the unfolded spectrum is that it is customary to discard from the analysis the states closest to the boundary of the spectrum or to the edges of the mini - bands .",
    "the reason is that these levels in contrast to the levels in the bulk of the spectrum do not interact with levels of both higher and lower energy .",
    "hence such levels are nongeneric .",
    "we usually discarded a few percent of the total number of states on that account .",
    "this effect is a size effect that is expected to be negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the simplest quantity one studies in rmt analysis is the probability distribution @xmath78 of unfolded energy spacings @xmath79 , where @xmath50 and @xmath80 are two consecutive unfolded energies .",
    "one compares the actual @xmath78 with the same quantity obtained for random matrices from one of the matrix ensemble introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : rmt ] . for diagonal random matrices",
    "@xmath78 is the poisson ( exponential ) distribution @xmath81 . for @xmath55 goe",
    "matrices the distribution of spacings is quite complicated for arbitrary @xmath82 , however it is always close to the exact spacing distribution of the @xmath83 goe matrices known as the wigner surmise , @xmath84 which therefore is used in practice .",
    "the spacing distribution probes correlations between consecutive states and is not sensitive to correlations of higher order .",
    "for example an artificial spectrum constructed by adding independent variables distributed according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : wiglaw ] ) will certainly show a wignerian spacing distribution but has clearly nothing else in common goe spectra . to test higher order correlations",
    "one then looks at the two - point correlation function @xmath85 and various weighted averages thereof @xcite . for goe in the large @xmath82 limit @xmath86 , with @xmath87 .",
    "one average of @xmath85 often studied is the number variance @xmath88 defined as the variance of the number of unfolded energy levels in intervals of length @xmath89 around the unfolded energy @xmath90 :    @xmath91 ^ 2 \\right\\rangle_{\\varepsilon_0},\\ ] ]    where @xmath92 is the unfolded level staircase , and where the brackets denote an averaging over @xmath90 . for the poissonian case @xmath93 , while for the goe case @xmath94 with a logarithmic asymptotic behavior .",
    "another average of the two - point correlation function is the spectral rigidity @xmath95 defined as the least square deviation of the unfolded level staircase @xmath96 from the best fitting straight line in an interval of length @xmath89 :    @xmath97 ^ 2d\\varepsilon \\right\\rangle_{\\varepsilon_0 } \\ ! \\ ! \\!.\\ ] ]    for the poissonian case the spectral rigidity is @xmath98 , while for the goe case @xmath99 , with @xmath100 and again with a logarithmic asymptotic behavior .",
    "the problem of diagonalizing the hubbard hamiltonian can be reduced considerably by group theoretical analysis . furthermore , as mentioned earlier and as illustrated by an example in sec .",
    "[ subsec : optimunf ] it is indispensable for the rmt analysis . the symmetries are explicitly dealt with from the beginning of the calculation by constructing the symmetry projection operators corresponding to all known symmetries of the model and using them to project into symmetry invariant subspaces of the full hilbert space @xcite . the main object of this section is to construct the three projection operators @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 corresponding to the space symmetry , the spin symmetry and the pseudospin symmetry , respectively .      the first symmetry we consider is the space group @xmath104 of the @xmath105 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
