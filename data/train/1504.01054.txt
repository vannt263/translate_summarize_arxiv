    "over the last decades an immense progress in control and manipulation of quantum states of light and matter and their mutual interaction has facilitated generation of squeezed states of light in a broad selection of physical systems : from the pioneering works on four - wave mixing in atomic vapors  @xcite and optical fibres  @xcite over commonly used workhorse systems based on spontaneous parametric down - conversion in @xmath1-materials to recent demonstrations of ponderomotive squeezing through optomechanical interactions  @xcite .    in the emergent field of optical quantum technologies , squeezed quantum states of light have become an essential resource for many continuous variable ( cv ) quantum information and communication protocols  @xcite . and",
    "the feasibility of exploiting such quantum - correlated states for ultra - sensitive measurements has been demonstrated in numerous implementations of quantum - enhanced sensing , pioneered in the context of mech - zehnder interferometry  @xcite , and by now applied at both micro- and macroscopic scales  @xcite .",
    "however , the size and operational complexity of quantum light sources remains a limitation for practical and industrial applications of optical quantum technologies and integration with electronics .",
    "efficient pulsed kerr - squeezing in standard polarization maintaining fibres  @xcite requires fibre lengths on the order of tens of meters and even monolithic squeezed light sources  @xcite employ bulk nonlinear crystals that are orders of magnitude larger than lithographically defined electronic integrated circuits .",
    "generation of twin beam squeezing has been demonstrated in whispering gallery mode disk resonators  @xcite and recently in resonant on - chip structures  @xcite , bringing the development of a fully integrated opto - electronic quantum sensing device an important step closer .",
    "but so far , an integrated source of quantum correlated cv states remains to be demonstrated .",
    "one major limitation for the integration of quantum light sources is optical loss .",
    "free - space setups mainly suffer from fresnel losses at optical interfaces , which can be mitigated by tailored anti - reflection coatings , reducing the effect to the 0.1% level per interface .",
    "however , in integrated waveguide circuits the light is also subject to material losses and scattering losses , originating from the roughness of the lithographically defined sidewalls and increasing quadratically with the refractive index contrast @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the former contribution is governed by intrinsic properties of the material s band structure and can not be compensated for .",
    "bulk crystalline silicon has a bandgap of 1.1ev leading to significant two - photon absorption ( tpa ) at wavelengths below roughly 2000 nm , and this is the reason why so much attention is currently drawn towards identification of cmos - compatible alternatives to the otherwise so appealing silicon - on - insulator ( soi ) platform for nonlinear optics .",
    "scattering losses , on the other hand , can be compensated for by optimization of fabrication procedures and engineering of waveguide dimensions . in stoichiometric silicon nitride films deposited with low - pressure chemical vapor deposition ( lpcvd ) , 200 nm thick channel waveguides with @xmath3 db / cm propagation loss at 780 nm",
    "have been demonstrated  @xcite . using temperature - cycling to overcome the tensile - stress limited film thickness of around 250 nm , propagation losses of -0.12 db / cm at 1540 nm",
    "have been measured in channel waveguides of more than 700 nm thickness  @xcite . and by employing a large aspect - ratio waveguide geometry the dominating scattering loss contribution can be shifted from the sidewalls to the waveguide top and bottom surfaces , which for lpcvd @xmath4 have roughnesses in the sub - nanometer regime , resulting in ultra - low waveguide propagation losses below -0.1db / m at 1580 nm  @xcite . unfortunately , this comes at the price of low field confinement , which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes .",
    "an alternative cmos - compatible material is high - index doped silica ( hydex ) which has recently been demonstrated to be a promising candidate for integrated nonlinear optics  @xcite . due to its high linear refractive index (",
    "@xmath5 = 1.5 - 1.9 ) and low propagation loss of @xmath6 a nonlinear parameter of @xmath7 at 1550 nm is achievable in high - confinement channel waveguides  @xcite .",
    "yet another severe loss - related challenge for high - index contrast waveguides is the inevitable mode conversion and effective index step associated with chip interfacing .",
    "the former leads to loss through coupling to radiation modes and the latter to fresnel loss and low collection efficiency because of the large numerical aperture of high - index contrast waveguides .",
    "the most common approach to overcome these complications is to employ inverse tapers ( spot size converters ) at the waveguide ends allowing near - adiabatic conversion between the tightly confined waveguide mode and that of a single mode tapered fibre or fibre pigtail .",
    "using such coupling strategies approximately -1.5 db / facet coupling loss has been reported for pigtailed high - index contrast hydex waveguides  @xcite .    in this paper , we study theoretically the feasibility of an integrated silicon nitride waveguide resonator as a source of quadrature squeezed light around 850 nm , conveniently centered in the ti : sapphire tuning range .",
    "classical optical parametric oscillations  @xcite and frequency comb generation  @xcite have been demonstrated in similar structures at telecom wavelengths , requiring careful engineering of dispersion properties in order to achieve a broad phase matching bandwidth .",
    "for the application discussed here , the phasematching condition is relaxed because the quantum correlated fields of interest are co - resonating rf - sidebands symmetrically distributed around the pump .",
    "this , however , introduces further complications at the state - interrogation stage , since the sidebands can not easily be separated from the bright pump field and the phase - space rotations required for standard homodyne state tomography are not readily realizable .",
    "integrated silicon nitride ring resonators have also been proven viable sources of photon pairs with controlable degree of correlation  @xcite .",
    "but so far , the cv quantum noise properties of the parametrically generated sideband fields have remained unexplored experimentally .",
    "optical losses are detrimental to quantum correlated states in general but quadrature squeezed states are particularly vulnerable .",
    "the effect of optical loss on such states is not just a mere reduction in production rate but an over all degradation of quantum correlations and thereby it s practical applicability .",
    "for a given amount of loss the state degradation is more pronounced for larger degrees of squeezing , rendering moderate squeezing levels a more practically tractable target .",
    "the primary objective of our analysis is to identify a feasible design for such an integrated device , subject to the constraints of conventional microfabrication techniques and commonly achievable propagation loss figures .",
    "we address this task by performing numerical simulations of optical key properties of the waveguide structure and using the results as inputs to a full quantum noise analysis of the nonlinear intra - cavity interaction .",
    "special attention is paid to optimization of chip in and out coupling since this is in general a bottleneck for the integration of quantum light sources .",
    "silicon nitride is a cmos compatible material widely used in microelectronics , both as gate dielectric in thin - film transistors and as mask , due to its high etching selectivity over silicon . in the field of integrated optics",
    "lpcvd deposited amorphous stoichiometric silicon nitride ( @xmath4 ) has only recently been introduced as a platform for nonlinear optics but has already been intensively investigated . due to its linear refractive index of @xmath8",
    "it is a suitable core material for high - index contrast waveguides in applications where tight field confinement and small waveguide bending radii are required . with a bandgap of approximately 5ev",
    "@xcite , the absorption edge of silicon nitride is just below 300 nm , providing low material loss in the visible and infrared , and above 600 nm tpa does not represent a limitation even at high power levels , as opposed to silicon . for the particular application at hand , an equally important property of silicon nitride",
    "is the reasonably high third order kerr nonlinearity @xmath9  @xcite , which is essential for implementation of parametric processes , enabling manipulation of the quantum properties of light . for comparison ,",
    "the nonlinearity of silicon nitride is roughly 10 times the nonlinearity of silica , 2 times that of hydex , and 0.1 times that of silicon .",
    "thus , with sufficient optical isolation from the silicon substrate , e.g. using silicon dioxide as cladding material , silicon nitride is a promising candidate for integration of quantum optical circuits where minimization of losses and strong interactions are of uttermost importance .",
    "the specific integrated system that we are concerned with in this paper is a buried channel waveguide circuit consisting of a racetrack resonator ( rtr ) with radius of curvature @xmath10 , laterally coupled to a straight bus waveguide ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rtr_topview ] ) .",
    "a finite overlap of the evanescent fields of the two waveguide modes in the coupling region allows coupling to the rtr with an efficiency modelled by the field amplitude coupling rate @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the resonator round - trip time and @xmath13 is the intensity transmittivity of the coupling mirror of an equivalent one - sided bulk - optics cavity .",
    "the approximate expression for @xmath14 is valid for @xmath15 .",
    "the coupling rate is controlled through the gap size and coupling length parameters @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "intra - cavity losses , primarily due to scattering from the waveguide sidewalls , are represented by an intrinsic loss rate @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the waveguide per meter loss parameter , @xmath20 is the vacuum speed of light , and @xmath21 the effective mode index .",
    "the total loss rate is given by @xmath22 ( hwhm ) determining the loaded quality factor of the resonator .",
    "an important parameter for controlling the squeezed light generation efficiency of the system is the escape efficiency @xmath23 , characterizing the collection efficiency of the intra - cavity field .",
    "the escape efficiency determines the coupling regime with @xmath24 corresponding to critical coupling and @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) to under ( over ) coupling . for the application of squeezed light generation , operation in the over coupled regime",
    "is required , but obviously there is a trade - off between efficient collection from the cavity ( large @xmath27 ) and resonant enhancement of the nonlinear process ( small @xmath28 ) .     and the width @xmath29 is chosen such that the waveguide only supports a single transversal mode .",
    "the gap size @xmath16 is fixed , and limited from below by the resolution of the lithographic method chosen , and the coupling rate @xmath14 is determined by the length of the coupling region @xmath17 . ]    as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtr_topview](b ) , we opt for a rectangular low - aspect ratio cross sectional geometry of the waveguides . for the sake of minimizing fabricational complexity , we restrict the thicknesss @xmath30 to a value of 250 nm , yielding the largest possible mode confinement while at the same time eliminating the need for stress - releasing temperature cycling in the deposition process .",
    "this in turn puts an upper bound on the width @xmath29 , due to the requirement of single mode operation ( cf . section  [ sec : waveguide mode properties ] )",
    "the underlying mechanism for nonlinear optical effects in kerr media is the third order tensor susceptibility @xmath31 , supporting a great variety of four - photon mixing processes , collectively termed _ four - wave mixing _ ( fwm ) . in general ,",
    "fwm processes involve conversion of two pump photons ( @xmath32 ) into a pair of photons at signal and idler frequencies ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) , respectively , with the convention that @xmath35 .",
    "the interacting field frequencies are related by @xmath36 , required by energy conservation , and in order for the process to occur efficienctly the phase matching condition @xmath37 must be fulfilled ; here expressed in terms of the guided mode propagation constants @xmath38 where @xmath21 is the effective mode index .",
    "for this reason , the dominant interaction is the intrinsically phase matched _ self - phase modulation _ ( spm ) process corresponding to the case of complete degeneracy of the partaking fields and resulting in an intensity dependent refractive index @xmath39 . in this case",
    "the pump field experiences a self - induced phase shift @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the nonlinear parameter , @xmath42 the effective mode area , and @xmath43 the pump power .",
    "it is well - known that this type of fwm is capable of generating self - induced single - mode squeezing  @xcite and it is also the interaction of primary interest to this work .",
    "however , in the context of nonlinear optics in integrated resonators a more commonly discussed interaction is _ non - degenerate four - wave mixing _ ( ndfwm ) where an intense pump field interacts with two or a multiple of weaker non - degenerate signal and idler fields , each of the fields being resonant on separate longitudinal resonator modes .",
    "parametric oscillators  @xcite and kerr - frequency combs  @xcite have previously been demonstrated using this interaction , and generation of squeezing , both below and above threshold , is discussed in  @xcite .",
    "a simple and intuitive understanding of pump squeezing by spm is provided in  @xcite : consider an input pump field @xmath44 consisting of a coherent carrier amplitude and vacuum fluctuations in the sideband quadratures defined as @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "both the coherent amplitude @xmath48 and the noise @xmath49 drives the spm process , resulting in a phase shift of the carrier proportional to @xmath48 and induced phase fluctuations at sideband frequencies given by @xmath50 . for small angles",
    "the corresponding change in the phase quadrature fluctuations is @xmath51 , yielding the following input - output relations for the quadrature fluctuations under influence of spm : @xmath52 while the amplitude quadrature is unaffected by the interaction , an amount of the amplitude fluctuations proportional to the carrier intensity is admixed to the phase quadrature thereby correlating the two .",
    "the correlations are strongest at a quadrature phase of @xmath53 for which the variance is @xmath54 .",
    "thus , for any @xmath55 the noise is , in principle , squeezed below the vacuum level at the optimal phase angle which in the limit of weak interaction strength is @xmath56 .",
    "however , the efficiency of the third order nonlinearity is very low and appreciable @xmath57-values are only achievable for very strong pump fields . in case of cw pumping this requirement can be addressed by resonant enhancement of the interaction which will be our focus in the following section .",
    "in this section we study the effects of spm on the quantum dynamics and noise properties of a cavity field interacting with a kerr nonlinearity .",
    "quantum mechanically the interaction is governed by the quartic term @xmath58 of the full fwm hamiltonian ( see appendix [ ap : kerr hamiltonian ] ) , where the interaction strength is given by @xmath59 following the quantum langevin approach we formulate linearized equations of motion for the intracavity quantum fluctuations , and the single mode squeezing spectrum for the output field is derived",
