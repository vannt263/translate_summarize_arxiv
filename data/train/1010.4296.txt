    "such jets are known to emit across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum , from radio to x - rays , and perhaps even @xmath6-rays .",

    "compact steady jets appear to turn off ( on ) as the source makes a transition from nonthermal to thermal ( thermal to nonthermal ) x - ray state , at luminosities typically a few percent of the eddington luminosity .",

    "* fender ( 2006 ) ) for a review on xrb jets .",
    "however , there is no clear consensus as to any lower luminosity limit for jets , or even about the mode of accretion at low mass accretion rates ( @xmath7 ) . while it is generally agreed that the radiative efficiency of the emitting plasma is low ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? *",
    "narayan & yi 1994 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* blandford & begelman 1999 ) ) at low @xmath7 , it is not even clear whether the observed emission originates in an inflow or an outflow .",
    "obviously instrumental limitations become important at the lowest luminosities .",
    "nevertheless , ever - improving technological advances are making it possible to detect sources at luminosities as low as @xmath8 l@xmath9 , a limit which is constantly decreasing .",
    "results of these fascinating experiments point strongly to the presence of outflows even at the lowest luminosities , for stellar as well as supermassive black holes . here",
    "we present a case study of two such sources : sagittarius a * , the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy , and the stellar mass x - ray binary a062000 , both of which suggest the presence of a jet at luminosities @xmath10 l@xmath11 .",
    "located @xmath12 kpc ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* ghez et al . 2008 ) ) . despite its relative proximity ,",
    "the source of emission from sgr a *  is still unknown .",
    "this is partly due to the extremely high extinction in the direction of the galactic center , and partly to the fact that with a bolometric luminosity @xmath15 , sgr a *  is extremely under - luminous compared to other active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "however , flares and data from multiwavelength campaigns provide important clues about the nature of emission from sgr a*. we have developed a time - dependent jet model which for the first time allows comparing the model predictions with radio flare data from sgr a*. taking into account relevant cooling mechanisms , we calculate the frequency - dependent time lags and photosphere size and compare with recent observations ( see fig .

    "since its massive outburst in 1975 , a062000  has been in quiescence , with luminosities around @xmath16 l@xmath9 .",
    "it has been detected in quiescence in x - rays , radio , ir , near - ir and optical using various space - based as well as ground - based instruments .    despite easy detection in the optical and near - ir , estimating the mass of the compact accretor has been quite a challenge .",
    "an accurate ( dynamical ) measurement of the accretor mass requires correct knowledge of the orbital inclination .",

    "* cantrell et al . ( 2008 , 2010 ) ) have analyzed @xmath18 years of a062000  optical and near - ir ( oir ) data and showed that previous disagreements on the inclination of a062000  were caused by ( 1 ) improper estimation of the disk flux ( which can be significant even in quiescence ) , ( 2 ) nightly variability in light curve shape , and ( 3 ) not recognizing that even during quiescence , the oir light curve shows three distinct optical states ( named _ passive _ , _ loop _ , and _ active _ , and characterized by magnitude , color , and aperiodic variability ) .",
    "of these three states the passive state is the faintest , shows consistent periodicity and is perhaps the closest to true quiescence .",
    "consistent estimates of the binary parameters are obtained when the above effects are properly accounted for , and the best estimates of ( @xmath19 , m ) are ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 m@xmath14 ) .",
