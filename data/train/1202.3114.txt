    "the set @xmath9 is a _ recurrence  set _ , or a _ poincar set _ , if for any dynamical system  @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is a measure - preserving transformation  of a non - atomic probability space @xmath12 , the following is true : for any @xmath13 with @xmath14 there exists a @xmath5 such that @xmath15 .",
    "recurrence is a central topic in ergodic  theory , and we refer the reader to one of the works @xcite , @xcite or @xcite and to the references therein for more information about it , as well as for applications to number theory and combinatorics .",
    "standard examples of recurrence  sets are the set @xmath16 of all integers ( this is the classical poincar recurrence  theorem ) , the set of squares @xmath17 , and more generally any set @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a polynomial  taking integer values on integers such that @xmath20 .",
    "also , any thick set , i.e. containing arbitrarily long blocks of integers , is a recurrence  set , as well as any set of the form @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is an infinite subset of @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not difficult to exhibit non - recurrence  sets : the set of odd integers is the easiest example , and rotations on the unit circle @xmath23 provide a wealth of non - recurrence  sets : if @xmath1 is any set for which there exists a @xmath24 and a @xmath25 such that @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , then @xmath1 is clearly not a recurrence  set .    in the rest of the paper , we will say that @xmath1 is a _ non - recurrence  set for the dynamical system _",

    "@xmath28 , if there exists a set @xmath13 with @xmath14 such that @xmath29 for each @xmath5 . given a non - recurrence  set @xmath1 ,",
    "it is interesting to try to construct @xmath28 as above with additional properties : can we construct @xmath11 ergodic ? weakly mixing ?",
    "the study of non - recurrence  sets for weakly mixing  dynamical systems was initiated by bergelson , del junco , lemaczyk and rosenblatt in the recent paper @xcite , where they give several examples of weakly mixing  non - recurrent  systems and study the relationship between non - recurrence  and rigidity .",
    "they prove here in particular that the generic transformation is both weakly mixing , rigid  and non - recurrent , and that if the sequence @xmath8 grows sufficiently fast , namely if it satisfies the condition @xmath30 then @xmath1 is a non - recurrence  set for some weakly mixing  dynamical system .",
    "our aim here is to continue this study of non - recurrence  sets for weakly mixing  systems .",
    "we first provide new examples of such sets by using a rather particular class of dynamical systems , namely linear dynamical systems .",
    "a _ linear dynamical system _  consists of a bounded linear operator  @xmath11 on a ,  complex infinite - dimensional banach space @xmath0 , and under certain conditions concerning , usually , the eigenvectors of @xmath11 associated to eigenvalues of modulus @xmath31 , it is possible to construct a probability  measure  on @xmath0 with respect to  which @xmath11 becomes a measure - preserving weakly mixing  transformation .",
    "more details about this will be given in the next section .",
    "we will also need to use some results about _ non - jamison sequences _ , which form a class of sequences connected to the study of partial power - boundedness of operators on ,  spaces , and which appear naturally as well in the study of rigidity sequences ( see @xcite ) .    here",
    "is our first result , which generalizes one of the results of @xcite mentioned above :    [ th1 ] if @xmath8 is a sequence of integers such that @xmath32 tends to infinity , the set @xmath1 is a non - recurrence  set for some weakly mixing  linear dynamical system .",
    "more generally , the same result holds if @xmath8 is a non - jamison sequence  for which there exists a @xmath33 such that @xmath34 ( i.e. if @xmath1 is a non - recurrence  set for some rotation on the unit circle ) .",
    "our second result concerns sequences @xmath8 such that @xmath3 divides @xmath4 for each @xmath35 .",
    "[ th2 ] let @xmath8 be a sequence such that @xmath36 for each @xmath35 .",
    "then for any @xmath37 , the set @xmath38 is a non - recurrence  set for some weakly mixing  linear dynamical system .",
    "this applies in particular to the set @xmath1 itself .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th2 ] uses the notion of rigidity , which was thoroughly explored in the context of weakly mixing  systems in the paper @xcite , and also in @xcite .",
    "part of the proof of theorem [ th2 ] relies on the fact that if @xmath8 is a rigidity sequence  in a certain strong sense , then @xmath38 is a non - recurrence  set for some weakly mixing  dynamical system , whatever the choice of @xmath39 .",
    "it seems to be an open question whether , if @xmath8 is a rigidity sequence  and @xmath39 , the set @xmath38 is always a non - recurrence  set for some weakly mixing  system .    a central open question in the paper @xcite concerns lacunary sequences : if @xmath8 is a lacunary sequence , i.e. if there exists an @xmath40 such that @xmath41 for any @xmath27 , then a result of pollington @xcite and de mathan @xcite is that there exists an element @xmath42 with @xmath43 irrational and a @xmath25 such that @xmath44 for all @xmath27 .",
    "so @xmath1 is a non - recurrence  set for some ergodic  dynamical system .",
    "hence the following natural question :    @xcite[q1 ] if @xmath8 is a lacunary sequence , does there always exist a weakly mixing  dynamical system  for which the set @xmath1 is not recurrent ?",
    "theorem [ th2 ] provides a positive answer to this question for sequences such that @xmath36 for each @xmath5 . cutting and stacking constructions",
    "can also be used to exhibit some non - recurrent  lacunary sets ( see theorem [ prop2 ] , which generalizes the result of @xcite that the set @xmath45 is non - recurrent  for the chacon transformation ) .",
    "our last result concerns sets which , for some fixed integer @xmath6 , are recurrent  ( in the topological sense ) for all products of @xmath7 rotations on the unit circle . in accordance with the terminology of @xcite ,",
    "let us call such sets _",
    "sets_. it is an open question , equivalent to an old combinatorial problem of veech @xcite about syndetic sets and the bohr topology on @xmath46 , to know whether any set which is recurrent  for all finite products of rotations ( such a set is called a _ bohr set _ ) is necessarily topologically recurrent  for all dynamical systems .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for more about this question .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that there exists for each @xmath6 sets which are @xmath7-bohr but not @xmath47-bohr .",
    "another construction of @xmath7-bohr sets which are not bohr is given in @xcite .",
    "one of the interests of the sets constructed in @xcite is that they have density zero , contrary to the sets of @xcite which have positive density .",
    "hence the sets of @xcite , which are non - recurrent  for some product of @xmath48 rotations on @xmath49 , are recurrent for all weakly mixing  dynamical systems .",
    "we show here , as a consequence of theorem [ th1 ] , that the sets @xmath50 of @xcite are @xmath7-bohr , but are not recurrent for some weakly mixing  dynamical systems :    [ th3 ] for any integer @xmath6 there exist sets @xmath50 of integers which are @xmath7-bohr , but which are non - recurrence  sets for some weakly mixing  linear dynamical systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section @xmath51 we recall some results about linear dynamical systems and jamison sequences which will be needed for the proofs of the theorems . in sections",
    "@xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 we present the proofs of theorems [ th1 ] , [ th2 ] and [ th3 ] respectively .",
    "section @xmath55 contains the proof of theorem [ prop2 ] concerning a construction of weakly mixing  non - recurrent  systems by cutting and stacking .",
    "* acknowledgement : * i am grateful to maria roginskaya for stimulating discussions about some of the results of this paper .",
    "in this section , which is expository , we briefly review some results concerning linear dynamical systems . they will be necesary for the proofs of the majority of the results in this paper . for a more detailed account",
    ", we refer the reader to the recent book @xcite .",
    "a linear dynamical system  consists of a pair @xmath56 , where @xmath0 is an infinite - dimensional complex ,  banach space , and @xmath11 is a bounded linear operator  on @xmath0 . under some conditions on @xmath11 and @xmath0 , it is possible to construct a non - degenerate  gaussian  measure  @xmath57 on @xmath0 with respect to  which @xmath11 defines a measure - preserving weakly mixing  transformation .",
    "recall that if @xmath58 denotes the @xmath59-algebra of borel subsets of @xmath0 , a borel probability  measure  @xmath57 on @xmath0 is said to be ( centered ) _ gaussian _  if any element @xmath60 , considered as a complex - valued random variable on @xmath12 , has ( centered ) gaussian  law : for any borel subset @xmath61 of @xmath62 , @xmath63 for some @xmath64 .",
    "the measure  @xmath57 is said to be _ non - degenerate _",

    ". whenever @xmath11 is a measure - preserving transformation  of @xmath67 , we will denote by @xmath68 the associated koopman operator  on @xmath69 : for @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "the study of operators  on banach spaces from the ergodic  point of view was initiated by flytzanis in @xcite , and developed later on in the two papers @xcite and @xcite . among other things ,",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition was obtained , under which a bounded operator  on a complex infinite - dimensional ,  hilbert space @xmath72 admits a non - degenerate  invariant  gaussian  measure  with respect to  which it defines an ergodic  ( or , equivalently here , weakly mixing )  transformation of @xmath0 .",
    "this condition involves eigenvectors of @xmath11 associated to eigenvalues of modulus @xmath31 , which we call _ unimodular eigenvectors_. it states roughly that if @xmath73 has a huge supply of unimodular eigenvectors ( which happens in very many concrete situations ) , @xmath11 defines a weakly mixing  measure - preserving transformation  of @xmath72 with respect to  some non - degenerate  gaussian  measure  @xmath57 .",
    "this condition is given in @xcite and @xcite in terms involving perfectly spanning sets of unimodular eigenvectors , but a simpler equivalent condition was recently obtained in the paper @xcite :    [ th0]@xcite , @xcite let @xmath11 be a bounded linear operator  on a complex ,  infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath72 .",
    "the following assertions are equivalent :    * for any countable subset @xmath74 of @xmath49 , the linear span of the eigenspaces @xmath75 , @xmath76 , is dense in @xmath72 ; * there exists a non - degenerate  gaussian  measure  @xmath57 on @xmath72 such that @xmath11 is a weakly mixing  measure - preserving transformation  of @xmath77 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for instance for many examples of such weakly mixing  linear dynamical systems , living not only on hilbert spaces but also on other banach or frchet spaces .",
    "extensions of theorem [ th0 ] to the banach space setting were obtained in @xcite and @xcite , culminating in the recent paper @xcite where it was shown that the implication @xmath78 remains true when @xmath0 is an arbitrary complex ,  banach space .",
    "let us now present a particular class of operators , which give in a very handy way examples of gaussian  weakly mixing  systems on a hilbert space associated to prescribed continuous measures on @xmath49 .",
    "these operators  were introduced by kalish in @xcite in order to exhibit , for each closed subset @xmath79 of @xmath49 , examples of operators  on a hilbert space whose spectrum and point spectrum coincide with @xmath79 .",
    "the construction goes this way . on the space @xmath80 of square - integrable functions on @xmath49 ,",
    "consider the operator  @xmath81 , where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are defined as follows : @xmath82 is the multiplication operator  by the independent variable @xmath84 on @xmath80 , and @xmath83 is the integration operator : for any @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , where , if @xmath88 with @xmath89 , @xmath90 denotes the arc @xmath91 , and @xmath92 denotes the arc @xmath93 .",
    "it is not difficult to check that for any @xmath24 the characteristic function @xmath94 of the arc @xmath95 satisfies @xmath96 , so that when @xmath97 is non - zero , it is an eigenvector  of @xmath11 associated to the eigenvalue  @xmath98 .",

    "lastly , we have to consider the case where @xmath404 is a red level of @xmath526 : here in general @xmath519 does not map @xmath404 onto a level of @xmath502 , and one has to go over to the towers @xmath527 , @xmath528 , etc . in order to see the action of @xmath519 on @xmath404 .",

    "then the same argument as in the proof of proposition [ prop1 ] shows that there exists a borel subset @xmath343 of @xmath292 of positive measure  with the property that @xmath537 for each @xmath35 .",
