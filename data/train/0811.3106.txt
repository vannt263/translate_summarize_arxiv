    "one of the less - studied interactions within our galaxy concerns the effect of the passage of a globular cluster ( gc ) through the disk , on the disk itself . on average",
    ", one globular cluster will cross the galactic disk about every million years . while the globular cluster is in the vicinity of the disk , its gravitational field will attract stars and gas in the disk . the result could be a density increase sufficient to cause star formation . whereas the impacts of high velocity clouds with the disk have been examined in some detail ( comern and torra , 1994 ) ,",
    "as they cause gas compression and star formation ( and are perhaps the origin of the gould belt ) , the effect of gc impacts on the disk has received almost no attention .",
    "the earliest mention of the effect of disk crossing by a globular cluster on the disk , is from brosche et al .",
    "( 1991 ) who calculated the orbits of globular clusters ngc362 and ngc6218 , and suggested observers examine their latest crossing points , to see whether any remnants may be present .",
    "wallin , higdon & staveley - smith ( 1996 ) developed the idea .",
    "their main argument is that gravitational focussing of disk material , such as gas , towards the gc trajectory would occur .",
    "they concluded that large ob star associations would form , possibly some 30 myr after the disk crossing , over a region of size @xmath010 pc .",
    "their paper elicited little reaction , aside from two instances .",
    "the first was by levy ( 2000 ) , who examined compression of disk gas by the shock wave produced during gc travel through the disk .",
    "this paper appears never to have been cited , in spite of its importance to this question ; we refer to it below .",
    "the second reaction to wallin et al s paper was the suggestion by r. rees and k. cudworth , ( reported in wright , 2004 ) that the star association ngc 6231 in the galactic disk is the result of such an interaction by globular cluster ngc6397 , less than 5myr ago .",
    "they reached this conclusion using positional and proper motion data , together with a code to calculate orbits in the galactic potential .",
    "they found the point of impact of ngc6397 to correspond to the position of open cluster ngc6231 , a finding we discuss later .",
    "the phenomena that take place in disk crossings by gcs are akin to those encountered in minor mergers and galaxy harassment , where a large galaxy interacts with a smaller galaxy at low and high relative velocities , respectively .",
    "cox et al . ( 2006 ) predict that the global star formation rate decreases with increasing mass ratio , so that mergers with mass ratio@xmath1 20 induce hardly any additional star formation in the more massive galaxy , above its quiescent level . in the case of gcs ,",
    "the mass ratios are even larger , but relative velocities are lower and local effects in the disk may still be significant .",
    "indeed , minor mergers have been proposed as the origin of nuclear starburst rings in some local galaxies ( e.g. mazzuca et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the objective of this work is to examine whether , in principle , star formation , or at least disk material compression could occur in a gc impact , and to look for possible remnants in the galaxy . in section 2 , we describe an approach to modelling the interaction between a gc and the disk , which establishes how compression may occur via gravitational focussing .",
    "this includes developing models of the galaxy and gc potentials to calculate the trajectories of gcs and test masses in the disk .",
    "we then note an alternate mechanism for compression , namely shock wave generation .",
    "if gas is present , such a mechanism will be more effective at inducing star formation . in section 3 , we apply the galactic models to locate the most recent impact areas of gcs in the disk . sections 4 and 5 use these location results to search for possible remnants in the galactic plane .",
    "finally , section 6 provides conclusions .",
    "a preliminary version of this work was reported in cropper & vande putte ( 2007 ) .",
    "we examine first the case of a gas - free disk , and consider the effect of a gc crossing , using numerical simulations of a series of test masses representing disk material encountering a globular cluster as it crosses the disk .",
    "these test masses are susceptible to the galactic potential , and to the potential of the globular cluster , but not to one another .",
    "we later consider the case where gas is present at the impact site .",
    "first , however , we use the next two subsections to describe the methods we employ to calculate orbits in galactic and gc potentials .",
    "we use four galactic potentials for which straightforward analytical expressions are available .",
    "we denote these da , fe , fl , and pa , as they appear in dauphole & colin ( 1995 ) , fellhauer et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , flynn , sommer - larsen & christensen ( 1996 ) , and paczynski ( 1990 ) , respectively .",
    "others have used these expressions in studies of galactic dynamics , for example kalirai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , law , johnston & majewski ( 2005 ) , pauli et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , and dinescu , girard & van altena ( 1999 ) .",
    "these potentials are all axisymmetric , so their expressions are simplest in cylindrical coordinates @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the distance to the z axis , @xmath4 is the azimuthal angle between the x axis and the projection of the position vector on the xy plane , and z the distance above the x , y plane .    the analytical characteristics of the potentials appear in table 1 .",

    "for the star formation time , we adopt a value of @xmath25=2 @xmath2610@xmath27 years , suggested by mckee and tan ( 2002 ) , for massive stars ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "taking the value @xmath22=30 myr , and an average ssc age of @xmath29=5 myr , we are able to identify 24 gcs as not being ssc progenitors , because the time since impact is too long compared with 35myr , using the fe potential . as a result",
    ", the list of fifty - four gcs to consider for monte carlo analysis is reduced to 30 candidates . a monte carlo analysis of these 30 candidates , similar to those above , using the fe potential",

    "hence here too , some gcs can be discounted , while others may be potential progenitors .",
    "having considered the fifty - four gcs , we then broaden our scope to all one hundred and fifty - five gcs in the harris catalogue , and note that we can also screen for candidates by using a weaker method but which does not require knowledge of any proper motions or radial velocities . as the position of the gc at the time of impact is the same as the position of the ssc s ancestral gas cloud , it is possible to calculate the minimum velocity @xmath30 required for the gc to cover the distance from that position , to its present - day position within a time @xmath31 .",
    "the escape velocity at the galactocentric distances ( @xmath32 ) in table 8 can then be calculated from the potential , using the relation @xmath33 ( binney and tremaine , 1994 ) . if @xmath30@xmath34 @xmath35then the gc s last disk crossing can not be the event that triggered the formation of the ssc .",

    "if star formation as a result of disk crossing is prompt ( @xmath22@xmath00 ) then we can exclude _ all _ gc crossings as triggering the formation of both ngc3603 and westerlund 2 .",
