    "despite being discovered 75 years ago@xcite , it still not well known what dark matter ( dm ) is composed of , and its properties .",
    "the current paradigm is that dm is composed of slowly moving very massive particles , thus being called cold dark matter@xcite ( cdm ) . despite its high predictive power and being in good agreement with large scale structure observations ,",
    "there is still some controversy respecting the small scale structure formation .",
    "there are a lot of different dm profiles , some empirical@xcite and some based on n - body simulations@xcite , with different properties .",
    "although cdm is the most accepted model , some problems still remain giving it the place to another type of dm , the warm dark matter ( wdm ) , with masses in an intermediate range between some kevs to some mevs .",
    "it can solve some of the problems of cdm , but also has some of its own .",
    "so , despite more than 50 years of research in dm , there is still a lot to explore .    on a complete unrelated field ,",
    "it is believed today that there is a supermassive black hole on the center of almost every galaxy .",
    "recent observations@xcite of a microwave emission from the center of the milky way suggest that there is a considerable amount of dm in the center .",
    "given these recent results , it could be possible that there is no black hole , but instead a distribution of dm particles .",
    "some authors@xcite suggested that an extended distribution of fermions , a `` fermion ball '' , supported by degeneracy pressure , is present on the center of galaxies instead of a supermassive black hole .",
    "we propose here a preliminary model for dm that tries to explain both the dm halos and the objects at the centers of galaxies by a self - gravitating system of semidegenerated fermions .",
    "the equilibrium configurations of a self - gravitating semi - degenerate system of fermions were already studied by others@xcite .",
    "we are considering spherical symmetry , so the spacetime is described by the schwarzchild metric @xmath0 solving the einstein equation we get the equilibrium equations : @xmath1 where @xmath2 the mass within a radius @xmath3 , @xmath4 the gravitational constant , @xmath5 the speed of light and @xmath6 and @xmath7 the mass - energy density and the pressure respectively , given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the multiplicity of states , @xmath10 is the planck constant , @xmath11 is the rest mass of the particle , @xmath12 the boltzmann constant , @xmath13 the temperature , @xmath14 the chemical potential and we write the integrals in terms of the kinetic energy of a single particle @xmath15 .    to integrate numerically the set of equations ,",
    "it is useful to change our variables to dimensionless ones : @xmath16 where @xmath17 has dimension of a length and @xmath18 is the planck mass . also , we write eq . [ dpdr ] in terms of the degeneracy parameter @xmath19 ( see refs . for details ) .",
    "the final set of dimensionless equations is shown in ref . , which we integrate with initial conditions @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is important to notice that we can solve the whole system completely in a dimensionless way without specifying a mass for the particle , which appears only in the characteristic length @xmath22 and in the definition of the temperature parameter @xmath23 ; however , this parameter can be uniquely determined by the surface velocity , as will be shown later .",
    "thus , the mass remains as only a scaling parameter and we are left with two free parameters , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "galactic halos are thought to be composed of cold dark matter ( cdm ) , so that @xmath25.also , since we are interested in semidegenerate configurations , @xmath26 must be a non negative parameter@xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we plot the degeneracy parameter and the density profile of the system as a function of the rescaled coordinate @xmath27 .",
    "since the tail of the distribution scales like that , the system is unbounded and with infinite mass . in reality",
    ", the system will be bound by tidal interactions , and a cutoff in the distribution function must be used@xcite .",
    "the astrophysically relevant quantity is the rotation velocity , given by ( non - relativistic regime , since @xmath30 ) : @xmath31        * i : the degenerate core , where @xmath32 ; * ii : the first part of the inner halo , where the mass of the core prevails over the halo and @xmath33 ; * iii : second part of the inner halo , where the mass of the inner halo prevails over the halo , and @xmath32 ; * iv : the outer halo , where the velocity tends to constant after some oscillations .        to confront the model with observations , it is useful to see how the physical quantities scale with the parameters of our model . our aim is to describe the galactic center and the dark matter halo , so we need to define both masses and radius for these regions .",
    "the radius of the core ( @xmath34 ) is defined as the radius for the maximum velocity in region i ; the mass is then @xmath35 ; for the halo ( @xmath36 ) , we take the radius where the velocity is maximum in region iii , with corresponding mass @xmath37 ; finally , the last observable is the surface velocity ( @xmath38 ) , i.e. , the velocity in the outer halo where it is constant .",
    "the scalings for these parameters are @xmath39    as we can see , the temperature parameter at the center , @xmath23 , can be uniquely determined by the observed surface velocity of the galaxy .",
    "another interesting feature is that , while for the core the mass and radius scale with @xmath40 , in the halo they scale with @xmath41 .",
    "these scaling laws are valid for @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 $ ]",
    ".      we can apply this model , for example , to the milky way .",
    "the observed halo velocity is @xmath44 km / s , which gives @xmath45 .",
    "taking the observations of the milky way , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 kpc ; and chosing eqs . [ vinf],[mc ] and [ rh ] for the three unknown parameters we have : @xmath49 which gives us @xmath50 pc .",
    "this is unfortunately larger than the apocenter of the closest star to the center , ie .",
    "the star s2 .",
    "recently , some authors@xcite found that , by fitting velocity curves with a burkert profile , the dark matter surface density is constant within one dark matter halo scale - length for a wide span of galaxy magnitudes , @xmath51 .",
    "this leads to a maximal acceleration due to dm at @xmath52 , @xmath53 . using this value in our model , taking into account that @xmath54 , we get from eqs . [ mh ] and [ rh ] @xmath55    common halo velocities range from tens to hundreds km / s , ie .",
    "@xmath56 $ ] from eq .",
    "[ vinf ] , and using the dm fermion mass obtained in the earlier application , we get that @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "so , for a wide range of the parameters with a fixed dm mass , our model is in good agreement with this universality law .    despite not being able to describe the core and the dm halo of our galaxy ,",
    "our model is in good agreement with some observations . of course",
    ", a cutoff in the distribution function is needed to avoid having an infinite mass , but the aim of this preliminary work is to show the scope of the fully relativistic treatment of the model in the application to galactic haloes and also to our milky way , concluding that some new physics must be added to the model in order to have a unified approach for the later case ."
