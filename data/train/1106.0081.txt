    "the structure of young populous ecs can be generally characterised by an rdp with multiple peaks on a large spatial scale or centrally condensed with an rdp that can be described by a king s law @xcite , although the present objects are not virialised .",
    "however , the differential dust absorption produces conspicuous variations in the rdps of the present objects .",
    "king profile describes the structure of clusters close to spherical symmetry and centrally concentrated . however , many young clusters are substructured or asymmetric , deviating significantly from this shape , and therefore can not be fitted by king s law @xcite . in fig",
    ".  [ fig:14 ] , we show the spatial distribution of stars in the decontaminated photometry of the three ecs that follow a king - like profile ( fsr 784 , sh2 - 235 cluster and sh2 - 235e2 ) and two representative cases of objects that do not ( kkc 11 and bdsb 73 ) .",
    "the former are centrally concentrated and nearly circularly symmetric . the cavities and overdensities in the stellar distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] ) can be seen as bumps and dips in the rdp ( fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] ) . on the other hand , objects like bdsb 73 that are not centrally condensed and kkc 11 with more elongated shape",
    "do not follow a king profile .",
    "the multiple peaks in the rdps of these ecs may be a fractal effect .",
    "if these objects survive the primordial gas expulsion , they may undergo merging evolving into a relatively smooth structure .    the angular distribution of decontaminated stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] ) , used in the cmd construction , reproduces the distribution of stars in the rdps built with filtered photometry ( figs .",
    "[ fig:12 ] and [ fig:13 ] ) , supporting the consistency of our results .",
    "given the poorly - populated nature of the ms , we simply counted stars in the cmds ( within the region @xmath7 ) , and summed their masses as estimated from the mass - luminosity relation implied by the respective isochrone solution ( sect .",
    "[ sec:3.2 ] ) .",
    "the results are given in table [ tab8 ] .    all the ecs clearly present distinct populations of ms and pms stars ( figs .",
    "[ fig:04 ] to [ fig:08 ] ) .",
    "however , given the differential reddening , it is not possible to attribute a precise mass value for each pms star .",
    "thus , we simply count the number of pms stars and adopt an average mass value for the pms stars to estimate @xmath8 and @xmath9 . assuming that the mass distribution of the pms stars also follows kroupa s ( 2001 ) mf",
    ", the zsc , average pms mass - for masses within the range @xmath10 - is @xmath11 .",
    "thus , we simply multiply the number of pms stars ( table  8) by this value to estimate the pms mass . finally , we add the latter value to the ms mass to obtain an estimate of the total stellar mass . these values should be taken as lower limits .",
    "is indicated as an open circle around the star . ]",
    "n - body simulations of massive star clusters that include the effect of gas removal ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that the phase of dramatic core radii increase may last about 10 - 30 myr .",
    "mass segregation may also lead to a phase of core contraction , with high mass stars more concentrated in the core while low mass stars are transferred to outer parts of the cluster . in this context",
    ", we suggest that most objects of our sample have not yet removed completely their primordial gas and are not in this expansion phase . as a consequence",
    "the core and cluster radii remain small .",
    "however , these ecs may be intrinsically small as well .",
    "@xcite argue that the structure in ecs reflects the underlying structure in the dense molecular gas from which they formed and suggest two possible structures for these objects : those similar to classical ocs ( radially concentrated that fit a king law ) and those that exhibit a density profile with multiple peaks .",
    "the latter kind of ecs present a fractal - like structure with smaller substructures or mini clusters that are probably a consequence of the fact that these objects are formed in a gmc with a fractal substructure ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "they evolve with time and their fates depend on the processes of dissolution , which they will undergo .",
    "if the ecs do not endure the action of the dissolution processes , they might evolve into a homogeneous distribution of stars and eventually disperse .",
    "otherwise their fate will be a centrally concentrated distribution of stars or a bound cluster .",
    "this is possible for the lower mass ecs and cluster pairs or multiples ( figs .",
    "[ fig:04 ] to [ fig:08 ] ) .",
    "it would also be important to have deeper observations of the less - populated clusters with irregular rdps ( fig .",
    "[ fig:13 ] ) . probing fainter pms stars might contribute to the construction of better sampled stellar density profiles , like those of the intrinsically populous and massive clusters in the present star - forming complex ( fig .",
    "[ fig:12 ] ) .",
    "when the projected mass density of a star cluster follows a king - like profile @xcite , the cluster mass ( @xmath12 ) can be expressed as a function of the core radius and the central surface mass - density ( @xmath13 ) according to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "[ fig:15 ] ( top - right panel ) shows the distribution of our populous ecs in the plane core radius ( sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] ) _ vs _ cluster mass ( sect .  [ mass ] ) .",
    "clearly , our ecs ( together with the reference sample ) distribute parallel to the above relation , being constrained within king - like distributions with @xmath15 ( these limits take the uncertainties into account ) .",
    "this correlation between cluster mass and core radius is consistent with the mass - radius relation suggested by @xcite for massive clusters younger than 100myr and extended for less massive ones @xcite .    since",
    ", the cluster radius and mass were estimated , we compute the cluster mass density @xmath16 .",
    "the results are shown in the plane @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:15 ] , bottom - right panel ) . despite the error bars , the density decreases with cluster radius as @xmath18 , similarly to the cluster sample studied by @xcite .",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig:15 ] the relation between age and both @xmath19 and @xmath20 for the present ecs .",
    "we fit an empirical curve @xmath21)-0.25 $ ] ( the solid line ) to galactic ocs younger than 100 myr . the dashed line is the observed relation for m51 clusters @xcite .",
    "the present clusters behave as relatively low mass ecs , as expected .",
    "in the present work we performed a field - star decontaminated 2mass analysis of 14 ecs in the h ii regions sh2 - 235 , sh2 - 233 , sh2 - 232 and sh2 - 231 , and other small nebulae in the area .",
    "we were able to derive astrophysical parameters and investigate the nature of young clusters embedded in these h ii regions .",
    "fundamental parameters were obtained for all ecs analysed , but structural parameters were derived for fsr 784 , sh2 - 235e2 and sh2 - 235 cluster . the decontaminated cmds exhibit a poorly - populated ms and a large fraction of pms stars , and suggest some age spread , as expected for sequential star formation process .",
    "two new ecs ( cbb 1 and cbb 2 ) were discovered in this work .",
    "the age , size and location of kkc 11 , fsr 784 , sh2 - 235 cluster , cbb 2 , and sh2 - 235e2 are consistent with the _ collect and collapse _ scenario .",
    "the cmds of sh2 - 235 b , bdsb 71 , bdsb 72 , bdsb 73 , sh2 - 232 ir cluster , g173 , cbb 1 , and pcs 2 suggest that these objects are ecs",
    ". the enhanced dust absorption mainly in the innermost region indicates that deep photometry is necessary to derive their structural parameters .",
    "the present ecs have core and cluster radii smaller than clusters at the same galactocentric distance and age .",
