    "it has been known for many years that two types of maximally entangled bell states can be generated in a system composed of two two - level atoms ; the so - called spin anti - correlated states that are linear superpositions of single excitation product states , and spin correlated states that are linear superpositions of double and zero excitation product states .",
    "recent theoretical and experimental work has demonstrated that single excitation bell states can be generated in a system of two rydberg atoms by the dipole - dipole blockade mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is often referred to as rydberg blockade and bears on the elimination of the simultaneous excitation of the atoms by shifting the double - excitation states of the system , an effect attributed to the long range dipole - dipole interaction characteristics of rydberg atoms  @xcite .",
    "rydberg atoms are highly excited atoms which have large sizes and therefore can have huge dipole moments , proportional to @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the principal quantum number  @xcite",
    ". because the dipole moments of rydberg atoms are so large , the atoms can strongly interact with each other even at large distances .",
    "the physical origin of the dipole - dipole blockade is explained clearly in terms of collective states of the two - atom system .",
    "these states provide a more natural basis for interacting atoms  @xcite .",
    "the effects of the dipole - dipole interaction include in general the creation of maximally entangled single excitation states and the shift of the states from the single - atom energy  @xcite . when the double - excitation states are shifted form their resonances , the two - photon excitation of the system by a resonant laser field becomes suppressed .",
    "the two - photon excitation is suppressed without destroying the one - photon excitation .",
    "the blockade effect is a simple process for creation of single - excitation entangled states , and the preparation of the entangled states via the dipole blockade has recently been demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the presence of only single excitations of the system is manifested by the photon antibunching effect , which signifies that at given time only a single photon is emitted by the system  @xcite . in the experiment of gatan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , a modification of the rabi frequency of the driving laser field by @xmath3 has been observed that is recognised as a signature of not only the dipole - dipole blockade effect , but also of the creation of a single excitation entangled state . in an earlier dipole blockade experiment , heidemann  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have observed the characteristic @xmath4 scaling of the rabi oscillations between the ground state and the single excitation multi - atom entangled state of a laser driven mesoscopic ensemble of @xmath5 ultracold rydberg atoms . in the experiments of zhang _",

    "@xcite and wilk _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , an entanglement between two rydberg atoms has been demonstrated by measuring the state fidelity of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , that are well above the threshold of @xmath8 required for quantum entanglement .",
    "the experiments clearly demonstrate that the dipole - dipole blockade can deterministically generate entangled states in an atomic system .",
    "the notion of blockade of multi - photon excitations is not restricted to the dipole - dipole blockade , but has been extended to photon blockade for the transport of light through an optical system  @xcite , and coulomb blockade of resonant transport of electrons through small metallic or semiconductor devices  @xcite .",
    "the photon blockade mechanism , similar to the dipole - dipole blockade , prevents absorption of more than one photon by an optical system . in analogy ,",
    "the coulomb blockade prevents transport of more than one electron through a metallic or semiconductor device .",
    "the dipole - dipole blockade mechanism described above applies to the process of the creation of maximally entangled single excitation bell states only .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper , therefore , to propose a mechanism which might be useful in achieving entangled two - photon bell states in a system composed of two coherently driven two - level atoms .",
    "as we have already mentioned , these states are linear superposition of product states with double and zero excitations .",
    "we shall demonstrate that the states could also be generated with the help of the dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms .",
    "specifically , we analyze the dipole - dipole interaction as a blockade effect for a single photon absorption of the laser field .",
    "we work in the collective basis of the system , and find that in the limit of a large dipole - dipole interaction , the collective four level system reduces to an effective two - level two - photon system .",
    "the state of this reduced system is then obtained analytically and the nature of the state is fully analyzed .",
    "we show that the creation of a pure two - photon bell state is dependent on the relaxation of the atomic excitation .",
    "when the relaxation is not present or can be ignored , the state of the system evolves harmonically between a separable to the maximally entangled two - photon bell states . with the relaxation present",
    ", the general state of the system is a mixed state that under a strong dipole - dipole interaction reduces the system to an @xmath0-state form .",
    "we find that mixed states admit of lower level of entanglement , and show that there is a threshold value for the dipole - dipole interaction relative to the rabi frequency of the driving field above which the atoms can be entangled over the entire time of the evolution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the interaction results in the dissipation of the atomic excitation and coherence , and we examine the effect of the dissipation on the transient evolution and stationary properties of the concurrence . the remarkably simple analytical expression is obtained for the steady - state concurrence .",

    "the potential depends on the distance between the atoms , mutual orientation of the atomic transition dipole moments , and the orientation of the dipole moments in respect to the interatomic axis . for the case of mutually parallel dipole moments ,",

    "we can write the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) in a matrix form using basis states of two non - interacting atoms that are four product states @xmath25 and find @xmath26 notice that in the absence of the dipole - dipole interaction , the single excitation states @xmath27 and @xmath28 are degenerate in energy with @xmath29 , and are separated from the zero @xmath30 and double @xmath31 excitation states by  @xmath32 , as illustrated in fig .",

    "( b ) in the presence of the dipole - dipole interaction , @xmath39 , and then the intermediate states are shifted from the one - photon resonance leaving only the two - photon transition on resonance with the driving field frequency . ]",
    "we are now in a position to explain qualitatively the idea of the creation of two - photon entangled states with the help of the dipole - dipole interaction .",

    "assume that the two - atom system is driven by an external laser field of frequency @xmath41 resonant with the atomic transition frequency , i.e. @xmath38 . consider separately two cases , the absence and the presence of the dipole - dipole interaction between the atoms . in the absence of the dipole - dipole interaction , the laser field drives on resonance both , the one- and two - photon transitions of the system , as seen from fig .",
    "[ dfig1](a ) . in this case , all states of the system are populated by the laser field . since the one - photon coupling dominates over the two - photon coupling , the intermediate states @xmath27 and  @xmath28 are more populated than the upper state  @xmath31 .",
    "the situation changes in the presence of the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the interaction shifts the intermediate states from the one - photon resonance , as shown in fig .",
    "[ dfig1](b ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the one - photon transitions become off resonance to the driving field frequency , but the two - photon transition remains on resonance . thus , in the presence of the dipole - dipole interaction , a resonant laser field effectively couples only to the two - photon transition of the two - atom system .",
    "a more quantitative attempt is presented below , where we show that the shift of the intermediate states by the dipole - dipole interaction can lead to the population of the upper state  @xmath42 without populating the intermediate states @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which then may result in a pure maximally entangled two - photon state of the system .",
    "let us first consider the case when the atoms are isolated from the environment . in this case , there is no relaxation of the atomic excitation , but there could still exist a non - zero dipole - dipole coupling between the atoms .",
    "in other words , there are no losses due to spontaneous emission and therefore the evolution of the system can be determined by the evolution of a pure state of the system . in practical terms , it could be done by placing the atoms inside separate cavities and to arrange the coupling between the cavities through an optical waveguide  @xcite . alternatively , one could trap single ions or atoms inside separate potential wells and use an additional trapped ion as antennae to enhance the dipole - dipole coupling  @xcite .",
    "assume that the two - atom system described by the hamiltonian ( [ e1 ] ) is subjected to a continuous driving by an external coherent laser field .",
    "the strength of the driving is characterized by the rabi frequency @xmath43 .",
    "the driving laser field has a traveling - wave character and is propagating in the direction orthogonal to the interatomic axis .",

    "the time evolution of the state vector of the system and so the concurrence depend , of course , on the initial state of the system .",

    "thus , crucial for entanglement is the presence of the dipole - dipole interaction that shifts of the single excitation states from their resonant values .",
    "the concurrence is different from zero and contains exponentials oscillating in time with three different frequencies , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 . since , in general , the three frequencies are not commensurate , the evolution of concurrence is not periodic .",

    "it is easy seen that the concurrences evolve in decidedly different ways . in particular",
    ", the concurrence of the state approximated by the density matrix  ( [ eq:50 ] ) does not reproduce the concurrence of the actual state of the system .",
    "it is rather close to the concurrence of the pure state of the system of atoms decoupled from the reservoir .",
    "the concurrence oscillates in time with the same frequency as that of the isolated system and persists over many rabi periods .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations decreases slowly in time and is damped out in a time of order @xmath157 .",
    "the reason for this feature of the approximate state of the system can be understood by referring to the asymmetry introduced to the system by the competing effects of spontaneous emission from the upper state @xmath42 to the symmetric and antisymmetric states .",
    "it is easily verified from eq .   that the antisymmetric state @xmath36 is populated by spontaneous emission from the state @xmath42 at a sub - radiant rate @xmath158 , which for small distances between the atoms is much smaller that the superradiant rate , @xmath159 , at which the symmetric state @xmath35 is populated .",

    "[ fig:6 ] that the concurrence of the approximate state ( [ eq:50 ] ) coincides quite well with the concurrence of the actual state of the system .",
    "the reason for this similarity is that , in the limit of @xmath161 , the symmetric and antisymmetric states are equally populated by the spontaneous emission from the upper state  @xmath42 .",
    "this results in an equal redistribution of the noise between the symmetric and antisymmetric states . in other words ,",
    "the antisymmetric state is now fully participating in the dynamics of the system , and the actual state of the system of atoms coupled to independent reservoirs can be well approximated by the density matrix .",
    "we close this part of the section by pointing out that following the results presented in figs .",
    "[ fig:4]-[fig:6 ] one would conclude that in the presence of spontaneous emission , the entanglement created by the two - photon coherence may exist only over a short time of the evolution of the system .",

    "a question then arises , which of the parameters are crucial for the entanglement to survive over a long time , presumably until steady state ? in order to examine this point more closely , we consider the steady state solution for the density matrix elements from which we then infer conditions for a non - zero steady state entanglement .",

    "it is seen that there is a threshold for the rabi frequency below which the atoms are entangled in the steady state .",
