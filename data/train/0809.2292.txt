    "a combined quantum mechanical / molecular mechanical ( qm / mm ) method is a powerful computational tool for studying chemical reactions in solution and in biological systems.@xcite it treats a chemically active part of the entire system with accurate qm methods while the rest of the system with mm force fields .",
    "the quality of a given qm / mm calculation depends primarily on the electronic structure method used . in the calculation of statistical properties like free energy ,",
    "it is also important to adequately sample the relevant phase space.@xcite however , this phase space sampling is very demanding computationally , because one needs to calculate qm electronic energy for a large number of statistical samples .",
    "one can ensure sufficient statistics by using fast semiempirical methods , but the resulting energetics may be less satisfactory than obtained with ab initio methods .",
    "on the other hand , highly correlated qm methods require too much computational time and thus it becomes difficult to explore the phase space .",
    "a variety of approaches have been proposed in order to address the above trade - off between accuracy and efficiency .",
    "one approach is a family of dual - level methods , in which a classical or semiempirical potential is used for statistical sampling and an accurate qm method for energetic corrections.@xcite another approach is to introduce some approximation to the qm ",
    "mm electrostatic interactions in order to reduce the number of qm calculations .",
    "our main interest in this paper is in the second approach above . in particular",
    ", we are concerned with the following three _ embedding _ schemes that prescribe how to calculate the qm wavefunction in the mm environment :    \\(1 ) _ gas - phase embedding scheme .",
    "_ this scheme totally neglects electrostatic perturbations of the mm environment on the qm subsystem .",
    "the qm wavefunction is calculated in the gas phase , and the resulting charge density or partial charges are embedded into the mm environment .",
    "the reaction path is also determined by the gas - phase calculation .",
    "the free energy profile in solution is obtained via free energy perturbation ( fep ) calculations along the pre - determined reaction path .",
    "this approach was first utilized by jorgensen and co - workers@xcite to study organic reactions in solution , and later by kollman and co - workers@xcite to study enzyme reactions .",
    "it should be noted however that this approach may not be appropriate for a certain class of enzyme reactions.@xcite    \\(2 ) _ mean - field embedding scheme .",
    "_ this method calculates the qm wavefunction in the presence of the mean field of the environment .",
    "the averaged polarization ( or distortion ) of the qm wavefunction is thus correctly taken into account , while statistical fluctuations of the qm wavefunction are totally neglected .",
    "indeed , this mean - field approximation has been the basis of many conventional solvation models like the pcm@xcite and rism - scf@xcite methods .",
    "the mean - field idea has also been applied to the qm / mm framework by several authors .",
    "for example , aguilar and co - workers @xcite performed geometry optimization on an approximate qm / mm free energy surface using the averaged solvent electrostatic potential ( asep)/md method .",
    "more recently , the mean - field idea was exploited by warshel and co - workers@xcite in order to accelerate qm / mm calculation of solvation free energy .",
    "\\(3 ) _ polarizable embedding scheme . _",
    "this method first develops a polarizable model of the qm subsystem and then embeds the resulting model into the mm environment .",
    "the polarizable qm model can be developed , for example , by taylor expanding the qm electronic energy up to second order .",
    "@xcite the qm / mm minimum free energy path ( mfep ) method by yang and co - workers @xcite is based on this perturbative expansion idea , which has been applied to chemical reactions in solution and enzymes . among the three embedding schemes above ,",
    "the polarizable one is most accurate by allowing statistical fluctuations of the qm wavefunction .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to formulate the mean - field embedding scheme above by starting from a variational principle for the qm / mm free energy ( ) .",
    "as mentioned above , conventional solvation models are based on the mean - field embedding approximation .",
    "they often start with a variational principle for the following free energy @xcite [ a_conv ] a ( ) = | | + .",
    "minimization of @xmath2 in terms of @xmath3 gives a nonlinear equation for @xmath3 that is subject to the mean field of the environment .",
    "very often , analytical gradient of free energy , @xmath4 , is obtained by utilizing the variational nature of @xmath2 . since those solvation models are quite successful in studying solution - phase chemistry , it is natural to try to extend them to the qm / mm framework .",
    "the main benefits of this extension are as follows .",
    "first , qm / mm models can describe inhomogeneous as well as homogeneous environments on an equal theoretical footing .",
    "this makes it more straightforward to compare the chemical reactivity of a system in different environments ( e.g. , in solution and enzymes ) .",
    "second , since the mean - field qm wavefunction is calculated only for a `` batch '' of mm configurations , the number of qm calculations can be made significantly smaller than a direct qm / mm statistical calculation .",
    "as mentioned above , such a mean - field qm / mm approach has been explored by several authors in the literature .",
    "for example , @xcite discussed such a method quite a few years ago based on a variational principle and linear - response approximation ( lra ) .",
    "more recently , kato and co - workers@xcite developed the qm / mm lrfe method using a different type of variational / lra idea and applied it to chemical reactions in solution and enzymes .",
    "on the other hand , aguilar and co - workers@xcite took a different approach in the asep / md method , where they did not invoke a variational principle nor lra but rather approximated the free energy gradient as follows : [ aguilar_grad ] = e ( , ) .",
    "here , @xmath5 is the total energy of the qm / mm system and @xmath6 denotes the statistical average over mm degrees of freedom . note that in `` the average of the energy gradient '' ( the exact expression ) is replaced by `` the gradient of the averaged energy '' in the spirit of the mean - field approximation .",
    "while aguilar demonstrated its accuracy via comparison with direct qm / mm calculations,@xcite the detailed derivation of was not provided and it was used as an ansatz . therefore , our first aim in this paper is ( i ) to formulate a mean - field qm / mm framework by starting from a variational principle ( but not invoking the lra ) , ( ii ) obtain analytical gradient of the associated free energy , and ( iii ) discuss a possible rationale for the approximate gradient in .",
    "the second goal of this paper is to understand the relation of the above variational / mean - field procedure with the underlying exact qm / mm free energy as well as existing qm / mm theories ( secs .",
    "[ sec : mf_pert ] and [ sec : fluc ] ) .",
    "first , it is shown that the above variational procedure is equivalent with the first - order expansion of effective qm energy ( in the exact free energy expression ) about the self - consistent reference field .",
    "as mentioned above , the qm / mm - mfep method @xcite is based on this type of perturbative expansions . therefore , it is interesting to compare the present approach with the qm / mm - mfep method in detail ( ) . from this comparison",
    "it follows that the variational procedure is essentially equivalent with model 3 of the qm / mm - mfep method with charge response kernel @xmath7 neglected .",
    "note however that the full version of model 3 includes that response kernel @xmath7 and thus it is more accurate by describing statistical fluctuations of the qm wavefunction .",
    "therefore , in we also discuss several possible ways for evaluating such non - mean - field effects on top of the variational / mean - field calculation .    as an illustration ,",
    "the present method is applied to an reaction in water ( ) .",
    "free energy profiles are obtained by integrating the free energy gradient and they are compared with free energy perturbation ( fep ) results . non - mean - field effects are also evaluated using a gaussian fluctuation model for the environment .",
    "the obtained results suggest that the non - mean - field effects are rather small for the present reaction in water .",
    "we consider the following qm / mm free energy ( or the potential of mean forces acting on qm atoms ) [ aqmmm ] ( ) = - d \\ { - e ( , ) } , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are cartesian coordinates of the qm and mm atoms , respectively , @xmath10 is the reciprocal temperature , and @xmath11 is the total energy given by [ total_energy ] e ( , ) = ( , ( , ) ) + ( , ) . here , @xmath12 is the electronic energy of the qm subsystem in the presence of an external electrostatic field ( called the effective qm energy ) . in the standard electronic embedding scheme ,",
    "it is defined via the following equation [ se_cont ] [ + d ( )  ( ) ] | = | ( note that the prime symbol will be attached on variables and functions of `` dummy '' nature ) .",
    "@xmath13 is the qm hamiltonian in the gas phase , @xmath14 is the qm charge density operator , [ rho ] ( ) = ^ _ z _ ( - _ ) - ^_i ( - _ i ) , and @xmath15 is an ( arbitrary ) external electrostatic field . in this paper",
    "we will utilize a discretized approximation to given by [ se ] [ _ + _ _ v _ ] | ( ,  ) = _ ( ,  ) | ( ,  ) , where @xmath16 are a set of `` partial charge '' operators associated with qm atoms @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the motivation for using is that the external field can be parametrized by an @xmath19-dimensional vector @xmath20 , where @xmath19 is the number of qm atoms .",
    "this fact makes the following discussion somewhat simpler .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that there is no fundamental difficulty in using the original equation in ; see for such a formulation . in",
    ", we summarize the present definition of the partial charge operator @xmath21 based on the electrostatic potential ( esp ) fitting procedure.@xcite    now going back to , @xmath22 are mm electrostatic potentials acting on qm atoms , [ vmm_alpha ] v _ , = ( _ , ) , where [ vmm ] ( , ) = _ l with @xmath23 being partial charges of the mm atoms .",
    "@xmath24 is the sum of the van der waals interactions between qm ",
    "mm subsystems and the internal energy of the mm subsystem , ( , ) = e_^ ( , ) + ( ) . in the following we will sometimes drop the arguments of @xmath25 and @xmath26 for notational simplicity , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 .      the free energy in may be rewritten as [ aqmmm_explicit ] ( ) = - d \\ { - [ ( , ) | + | ( , ) + ] } , by explicitly writing @xmath29 in terms of the qm wavefunction .",
    "note that @xmath25 always stands for @xmath30 as mentioned above . a direct evaluation of @xmath31 is computationally demanding because @xmath32 depends on @xmath9 through @xmath27 .",
    "to avoid repeated qm calculations , let us replace the true wavefunction @xmath32 by some trial one @xmath33 that best approximates the true wavefunction in a statistically averaged sense .",
    "to do so , we consider a free energy functional of the form [ a_vp ] = \\ { - [ | + | + ] } .",
    "since the following inequality holds by definition for arbitrary @xmath27 [ we assume that @xmath34 is the ground state of @xmath35 , ( , ) | + | ( , ) ( ) | +    namely , @xmath36",
    "$ ] is a strict upper bound on @xmath31 , and the best approximation to @xmath31 is obtained by minimizing @xmath36 $ ] with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "this variational principle is indeed a direct qm / mm analog of the standard ones used in conventional solvation theories.@xcite by minimizing the following lagrangian to account for the normalization of @xmath37 , l [ , , ] = - \\ {    @xmath37 : [ nlse ] | = | . here",
    "@xmath38 represents the statistical average over mm degrees of freedom , [ mm_ave ] _  = , and @xmath39 = \\langle \\psi ' | \\qvecop | \\psi ' \\rangle$ ] .",

    "since is nonlinear with respect to @xmath37 , it is usually solved via iteration .",
    "it follows from comparison between that @xmath37 and @xmath40 may be written as & = & ( , ) , + & = & ( , ) , where @xmath41 is the self - consistent response field determined by [ sc_cond ] ( ) & = & ( , ) _ , + ( ) & = & | | , with @xmath42 .",
    "in this paper , will be called the self - consistent ( embedding ) condition .",
    "the minimum value of the free energy functional is obtained by inserting @xmath43 into : _ & = & \\ { - [ | + | + ] } + & = & | | + ( , ) + & & ( ) , [ amf_var ] where @xmath44 is defined by [ amm ] ( ,  ) = e ^ - [  + ] .",

    "the above equation is very similar to @xmath46 in , and indeed , the latter can be recovered simply by setting @xmath54 to the self - consistent potential @xmath41 : [ amf ] ( ) = ( , ) + ( , ) .",

    "= = ( ) , .",
    "it then follows that the derivatives of @xmath55 and @xmath56 cancel with each other and we are left with the following : [ grad ] ( ) = .",
    "this is our working equation for the gradient of qm / mm free energy with mean - field embedding [ see also for related equations ] .",
    "the first term is the partial @xmath8 derivative of the effective qm energy ( _ not _ of internal qm energy @xmath57 ) , which may be written using the hellman - feynman theorem as [ eeffqm_deriv ] .",

    "we now compare the above perturbative approach with the qm / mm - mfep@xcite and asep / md methods.@xcite the qm / mm - mfep method develops a series of polarizable qm models by taylor expanding its energy and esp charges up to first or second order .",

    "the aim of this section is thus to discuss several ways for evaluating such non - mean - field effects on qm / mm free energy .",
    "first , let us separate the total energy into the mean - field and non - mean - field contributions as follows : [ e_separate ] e ( , ) = ( , ) + ( , ) , where @xmath64 is defined by and @xmath65 is the remaining part of the total energy . using the definition of @xmath11 in",
    ", the non - mean - field term can be written more explicitly as @xmath66 inserting into the exact @xmath49 in gives [ a_separate ] ( ) = ( ) + ( ) , where [ afluc ] ( ) = - ( - ) _ .",
    "we note that up to this point are still exact .",
    "the statistical average in can be evaluated rather rigorously as follows .",
    "first , one calculates a long trajectory of the mm subsystem using the sampling function @xmath67 , selects a relatively small subset of mm configurations from the long trajectory ( say , 500 samples ) , and calculates @xmath68 for those selected configurations in order to take the average of @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , this is a type of dual - level qm / mm sampling method , where @xmath67 is used as a low - cost sampling function while @xmath68 gives energetic corrections .",
    "although the above dual - level method is rigorous , it requires hundreds of qm calculations and thus may be rather expensive .",
    "one approach for reducing the computational cost is to truncate the expansion of effective qm energy at the second order,@xcite [ efluc_approx ] ^(2 ) = ( - ) ( - ) , where @xmath70 is defined by [ chiqm ] ( ,  ) = = with @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath70 is also called the charge response kernel due to the second equality in .@xcite once @xmath70 is obtained , the statistical average of @xmath72 can be evaluated with no extra qm calculations , thus significantly reducing the computational cost .",
    "the above second - order expansion is also utilized by models 2 and 3 of the qm / mm - mfep method [ see in the present paper ] in order to describe statistical fluctuations of the qm wavefunction .",
    "@xcite    a further simplification can be made by introducing a gaussian fluctuation model for the mm environment .",
    "specifically , we assume that the mm electrostatic potential acting on qm atoms , @xmath27 , takes a ( multi - dimensional ) gaussian distribution : @xcite @xmath73      .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] here , @xmath74 is the covariance matrix of @xmath25 , = ( - ) ( - ) ^t _ . by combining @xmath75 in and the gaussian fluctuation model above",
    ", we obtain an approximate analytical expression for @xmath76 : [ afluc_gf ] ( ) [ 1 + ] .",
    "note that since @xmath70 is negative definite , @xcite @xmath75 and @xmath76 are always negative .",
    "the basic appeal of is that once the charge response kernel @xmath70 is obtained , @xmath76 can also be obtained simultaneously by combining with @xmath74 that is available from the mean - field calculation .",
    "@xmath70 can be evaluated most efficiently by solving a coupled - perturbed hartree - fock or kohn - sham equation , @xcite or more primitively , by numerically differentiating the esp charges @xmath77 with respect to @xmath78 based on the second equality in .",
    "we now apply the above method to a type - ii reaction in water ( the menshutkin reaction ) [ menshutkin ] .",
    "this reaction is known to exhibit greatly enhanced rates in polar solvents than in the gas phase due to strong electrostatic stabilization of the products.@xcite this is in contrast to type - i reactions like @xmath79 which are decelerated by greater electrostatic stabilization of the reactant than of the transition state . due to the great acceleration in rate ,",
    "the menshutkin reaction became the subject of many theoretical studies.@xcite gao and xia performed the first extensive qm / mm study using the am1 model,@xcite and demonstrated that the transition state in water is shifted remarkably toward the reactant region .",
    "continuum solvent models were also applied to the same reaction at various levels of qm methods .",
    "@xcite while those studies observed that continuum models can provide free energetics similar to the qm / mm results,@xcite it was also argued that those models may not be appropriate for reaction ( [ menshutkin ] ) due to the presence of hydrogen bonds.@xcite since then , several qm / mm(-type ) calculations were performed , @xcite including the rism - scf method,@xcite a mean - field qm / mm approach,@xcite and a dual - level method.@xcite overall , those calculations are in reasonable agreement with each other , predicting the free energy of activation @xmath80 to be 20 @xmath81 30 kcal / mol and the free energy of reaction @xmath82 to be @xmath83 @xmath81 @xmath84 kcal / mol ( both including solute entropic contributions ) . among those studies ,",
    "the present one is most similar in spirit to the mean - field qm / mm calculation by aguilar and co - workers .",
