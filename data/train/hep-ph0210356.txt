    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is believed to be one of the most attractive scenarios for physics beyond the standard model . in the last few years around 150 papers on experimental searches for susy",
    "were published , out of which around 100 were related to the lep results .",
    "this large number of papers reflects perhaps as well the large number of free parameters relevant to susy models at the presently explored energy scale .",
    "lep is well suited to explore corners of susy models in a relatively assumption independent way .    in this paper",
    "the results obtained by lep experiments within the gravity - mediated constrained mssm framework and the minimal sugra scenario are presented , emphasis is put on the model dependence of the exclusion .",
    "see @xcite for a recent general review .    in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )",
    "@xcite , each standard model particle has a supersymmetric partner with the same couplings and with spin differing by @xmath0/2 .",
    "large corrections to the higgs mass from interactions involving virtual particles ( heavy quarks in particular ) are partially cancelled due to their superpartners .",
    "if they are lighter than 1 - 10   this solves the so called hierarchy problem @xcite .",
    "moreover , supersymmetric particles modify the energy dependence of the electromagnetic , weak and strong coupling constants , and help them to unify at the scale of around @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the higgs sector of the mssm has to be extended to two complex higgs doublets @xmath2 responsible for giving masses to the up and down - type fermions .",
    "five physical higgs boson mass states remain after the electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the lightest scalar neutral higgs boson @xmath3 and the heavier pseudoscalar neutral higgs boson @xmath4 are of interest for this paper . on the tree level ,",
    "masses of the higgs bosons depend on just two parameters , which can be chosen as tan@xmath5 , the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , and @xmath6 .",
    "in particular @xmath7 , , @xmath8 , and for @xmath9 10 , @xmath10 however due to radiative corrections mentioned above ( which depend on the top quark mass , and on the mass terms of the superpartners of heavy quarks ) , the upper limit on the mass of the lightest higgs boson grows to @xmath11  135  @xcite .",
    "+ if @xmath12 150  the lightest supersymmetric higgs boson resembles very much the one of the standard model .",
    "precise electroweak measurements @xcite suggest that the higgs boson is relatively light , 110  if the top quark mass is assumed to be one standard deviation above its central value ] @xmath13 , well in the range of the mssm prediction .",
    "searches for the standard model like higgs boson at lep @xcite set a lower limit for @xmath14 , @xmath15114.4  ( if @xmath16 6 , or @xmath17120  ) , constraining heavily the mssm .",
    "the 1.7@xmath18 `` excess '' observed at lep @xcite of events compatible with production of the standard model higgs boson with @xmath19 , together with the ew constraints , makes low @xmath14 , just above the reach of lep , quite probable .",
    "the mssm provides a phenomenologically interesting wealth of superpartners of the standard model particles .",
    "supersymmetric partners of gauge and higgs bosons ( gauginos and higgsinos ) mix to realize four neutral mass states , neutralinos , @xmath20 , and four charged mass states , charginos , , .",
    "superpartners of left - handed and right - handed fermions , `` right - handed '' and `` left - handed '' scalar quarks ( squarks ) and scalar leptons ( sleptons ) can mix .",
    "this leads to the off - diagonal `` left - right '' terms in their mass matrices and induces an additional mass splitting between the lighter and the heavier state .",
    "while the higgs sector is well constrained in the mssm , very little can be said about the superpartners mass spectrum unless one makes some additional assumptions .",
    "as no superpartners were found so far the supersymmetry has to be broken .",
    "the pattern of the sparticle mass spectrum depends primarily on the mechanism of its breaking .    in the models with gravity",
    "mediated supersymmetry breaking which will be discussed in this paper , the lightest neutralino ( ) is usually the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . if r - parity - parity is a multiplicative quantum number defined as @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the baryon number , the lepton number and the spin of the particle , respectively .",
    "sm particles have r=+1 while their susy partners have @xmath25 is conserved the lsp does not decay , and it is an ideal cold dark matter candidate @xcite.constraints on models with broken r - parity were discussed in @xcite and are thus not discussed in this paper .",
    "experimental searches motivated by the mssm with r - parity conservation and gravity - mediated supersymmetry breaking exploit features of the model independent of further assumptions , like the strength of superpartner couplings to the gauge bosons , pair - production of sparticles , and the missing energy and momentum signature due to escaping lsps in the final state",
    ".    however , to cover `` pathological '' situations with final states which can not be efficiently detected or situations where the production cross - sections are low , or finally to achieve more predictivity and set limits on masses of the sparticles which are not directly observable ( e.g. the lsp in the r - parity conserving model ) , additional model assumptions have to be made . in this paper two `` flavours '' of such constraining assumptions",
    "are discussed ( see section [ sec : models ] ) : the constrained mssm with non - universal higgs parameters ( cmssm with nuhp ) , which is often used to interpret lep results , and an even more constrained minimal sugra scenario ( msugra ) , often used to interpret tevatron results and for benchmark searches at future colliders @xcite . it is shown in section [ sec : limits ] that in both models lep results can be used to exclude sparticles much beyond the kinematic limit of lep .",
    "+ perspectives to find sparticles at the tevatrons run ii in view of limits from lep are discussed in @xcite .",
    "to make the mssm more predictive , the unification of some parameters at a high mass scale typical of grand unified theories ( gut ) can be assumed . in this section ,",
    "approximate relations between the model parameters and the superparners masses which are important to understand the experimental limits will be quoted without explanations . for a more complete information see e.g. @xcite .      as well as",
    "the already mentioned  and @xmath6 , the following parameters are relevant in the constrained mssm with non - universal higgs parameters :    * , the higgs mass parameter , * , the @xmath26 gaugino masses at the electroweak ( ew ) scale",
    ". gaugino mass unification at the gut scale is assumed , with a common gaugino mass of @xmath27 .",
    "the resulting relation between @xmath28 and @xmath29 is @xmath30 , * , the sfermion masses . under the assumption of sfermion mass unification , is the common sfermion mass at the gut scale , * the trilinear couplings determining the mixing in the sfermion families .",
    "the third family trilinear couplings are the most relevant ones , .",
    "gaugino mass unification leads to @xmath31 and to the following approximate relations between , and the gluino mass ( @xmath32 ) :    * in the region where and are _ gauginos _ ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath34 @xmath35 2 , @xmath36 3.2 and @xmath35 @xmath29 , * in the _ higgsino _ region ( @xmath37 ) , @xmath35 @xmath35 @xmath38 . +    the relations between chargino , neutralino and gluino masses and @xmath39 and @xmath29 are affected by radiative corrections of the order of 2%-20% @xcite . however , _ only the relative relations between chargino , neutralino and gluino masses are important from the experimental point of view _ , and here the corrections are much smaller . for example , the relation / @xmath35 2 in the gaugino region , which is usually exploited to set a limit on the lsp mass , receives the corrections only of the order of 2% ; and the ratio @xmath40 @xmath35 3.2 receives corrections of the order of 6% .",
    "thus , for example , the limit @xcite on the chargino mass of 103.5   set by lep ( valid for @xmath41300  , @xmath41 , and for @xmath42  ) can be safely translated to @xmath9 51  and @xmath43  310  .",
    "if the sleptons are heavy the chargino mass limit excludes regions in ( @xmath44 ) plane ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for @xmath9",
    ", 2 @xmath45100   is excluded up to very high values of @xmath29 ( of the order of 1000  or more ) while @xmath46 100  is excluded for @xmath45100 .",
    "electroweak symmetry imposes the following relation between the masses of the superpartners of the left - handed electron ( ) and of the neutrino ( ) ,    \\1 ) @xmath47 .",
    "the assumption of sfermion mass unification relates masses of the `` left - handed '' ( @xmath48 ) and the `` right - handed '' ( @xmath49 ) `` light '' sfermions , `` light '' squark masses , and the gaugino mass parameter @xmath29 . for example :    \\2 ) @xmath50 @xmath51 @xmath52    \\3 ) @xmath53 @xmath51 @xmath54    \\4 ) @xmath55 @xmath51 @xmath56",

    "+ mixing between left and right states ( present for superpartners of heavy fermions ) gives rise to off - diagonal `` left - right '' mixing terms in their mass matrices , which lead to a mass splitting between the lighter and the heavier state . at the ew scale",
    "these terms are proportional to @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 for ,  and , respectively , where @xmath63 are free parameters .",
    "therefore , for large @xmath64 this can give light stau and sbottom states if  is large , or a light stop for small .",
    "for large @xmath6 , the lightest higgs boson mass depends primarily on , @xmath65 and the mixing in the stop sector @xmath66 ( expressed here as @xmath67 ) , and this dependence is maintained whether any additional constraints on the mssm are imposed or not . the top quark mass is presently known with the uncerntainty ( 1@xmath18 ) of around 5  @xcite , and the resulting uncerntainty of the lightest higgs boson mass calculation is around 6.5  , as @xmath68 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for a given  and top mass , the maximal @xmath69 occurs for @xmath70 .",
    "another , slightly lower maximum occurs for @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 is typically taken to be of the order of the gluino mass , or of the diagonal terms in the squark mass matrices , and @xmath69 grows with @xmath72 .",
    "it should be noted that the off - diagonal terms in mass matrices of the third family sparticles can not be too big compared to the diagonal terms , in order for a real solution for sparticle masses to exist . as diagonal terms grow with @xmath73 and @xmath29 , for every given value of the off - diagonal term a lower limit",
    "is set on the corresponding combination of @xmath73 and @xmath29.[multiblock footnote omitted ]      in the minimal sugra model not only the sfermion masses , but also the higgs masses @xmath74 and @xmath75 , are assumed to unify to the common @xmath73 at the gut scale .",
    "then @xmath76 becomes negative at the ew scale in most of the parameter space , thus ensuring ew symmetry breaking .",
    "the additional requirements of the unification of the trilinear couplings to a common @xmath77 and the correct reproduction of the ew symmetry scale , which fixes the absolute value of @xmath64 , defines the minimal gravity - broken mssm ( msugra ) . the value of @xmath78 can be determined minimising the higgs potential and requiring the right value of @xmath79 . at tree level @xcite :    \\6 ) @xmath80",
    "\\7 ) @xmath81 , @xmath82    the parameter set is then reduced to @xmath83 and the sign of @xmath64 .",
    "+ in addition to the mass relations listed in the previous subsection , @xmath6 can be related to @xmath84 ( @xmath29 ) , @xmath73 and yukawa coupling of the top quark .",
    "the stop mixing parameter can be expressed ( approximately ) as @xmath85 . for low , @xmath86 @xmath35 @xmath87 .",
    "as @xmath69 grows with @xmath6 and @xmath88 ( see section ) , higgs searches can be used to set a limit on @xmath84 ( @xmath29 ) which depends on , @xmath77 , and @xmath65 .",
    "the lightest higgs mass can thus be related to @xmath84 ( @xmath29 ) , and the experimental limit on it can be used to set limits on the masses of ( for example ) the lightest chargino and the lightest neutralino dependent on , @xmath77 and @xmath65 .",
    "in years 1995 - 2000 , the aleph , delphi , l3 and opal experiments at lep collected an integrated luminosity of more than 2000  at centre - of - mass energies ranging from 130  gev to 208  gev .",
    "these data have been analysed to search for the sfermions , charginos , neutralinos and higgs bosons predicted by supersymmetric models @xcite .      after the higgs @xcite , charginos were the most important susy discovery channel at lep . unless there is a light sneutrino ( in the gaugino region the chargino production cross - section can be quite small due to the negative interference between the t - channel sneutrino exchange diagram and the s - channel @xmath89 exchange diagram .",
