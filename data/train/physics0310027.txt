    "studying the interaction energy of vortices of the ginsburg - landau model of superconductivity , jacobs and rebbi @xcite have derived a nonlinear equation from which the scalar function ( order parameter ) can be calculated .",
    "the derivation is based on the similarity of this model with the abelian higgs theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in a special case",
    ", corresponding to a particular choice of parameters , the nonlinear equation takes a simple form , a nonlinear elliptic differential equation in two spatial dimensions .",
    "the same problem is treated by dunne @xcite in a general context of gauge theories with maxwell and/or chern - simons terms in the lagrangean density .",
    "the same abelian higgs field theory is discussed and the special case mentioned above is identified as the minimum of the action functional ( saturation of the bogomolnyi inequality ) , realized by fields obeying a simpler set of equations .",
    "this special case is called self - duality , with reference to the equality of the differential two - form ( the curvature of the fibre bundle ) with its hodge dual in the geometrical setting of the field - theoretical content .    in fluids and",
    "plasmas coherent motion and in particular vortices are ubiquituous @xcite .",
    "they can appear even in turbulent states . in two - dimensions , apart from the dynamical equations derived from the conservation laws an alternative model has been proposed , consisting of the motion of discrete , point - like vortices in plane interacting via a potential @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that this model can be mapped onto a field - theoretical model whose structure is very similar with the non - abelian gauge - higgs field theory @xcite .",
    "the self - dual state of this field at stationarity is precisely the asymptotic state of the ideal fluid , which effectively provides an analytic derivation of the _ sinh_-poisson equation describing the fluid streamfunction . for the stationary states attained at very large time by the ideal ion instability in plasma ( described by hasegawa - mima )",
    ", the model of discrete vortices interacting in plane introduces a short - range potential ( then a massive photon of the gauge field in the field theoretical model ) .",
    "there are two differences between the field theoretical models developed starting from the plasma problems and the model from which jacobs - rebbi equation is derived .",
    "first , the absolute value of the scalar higgs field is constant at large distances ( on a circle of very large radius ) ; this means that the vorticity should be constant at large distance , in the plasma case .",
    "second , the model must be abelian , which is less than we would need for treating the case of the euler fluid ( the _ sinh_-poisson equation ) .",
    "however , there are physical situations where the boundary conditions for the vorticity are compatible with the formulation of the jacobs - rebbi model . and",
    ", it is known that abelian models can provide description of plasma problems ( guiding centre particles , for example ) leading to the liouville equation .",
    "the effect of these differences still needs to be investigated , but in any case , the exact determination of the solution can only be a useful instrument .",
    "it is usual to consider that the jacobs - rebbi equation can not be solved analytically and in consequence numerical solutions have been provided .",
    "we show in this paper that the jacobs - rebbi equation is exactly integrable .",
    "we consider the integrability on periodic domains and provide the lax pair .",
    "we follow the standard algebraic - geometric method of integration and generate explicit solutions in terms of riemann _ theta _ functions .",
    "the ginsburg - landau theory is the framework in which the jacobs - rebbi equation has been derived , since the original aim was the investigation of the energy of interaction between two vortices in superconducting helium .",
    "the interest for vortical structures of ginsburg - landau comes also from the observation that the theory of a gauge field coupled to a scalar field ( abelian higgs field ) can in some cases exhibit also coherent vortical structures .",
    "we include in this section the derivation according by jacobs and rebbi @xcite",
    ". in fluid physics other approaches can be developed to arrive at similar forms of the equation .",
    "the free energy of the ginsburg - landau theory and the potential energy of the abelian - higgs theory is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex scalar field , @xmath2 is the abelian gauge potential and @xmath3 the minimum of the energy is attained for @xmath4    the variables are rescaled as @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 and the energy becoms @xmath8 where @xmath9    the model is restricted to the case where all field functions does not depend on the third coordinate and @xmath10 in plane the coordinates are expressed by complex variables @xmath11 and the differential operators can be defined @xmath12 analoguous combinations are used for the two remaining potential components @xmath13    the energy per unit length along the coordinate axis @xmath14 is @xmath15 @xmath16    in the following the _ tilda _ will be omitted .",

    "the procedure is similar to those developed for the _ sine_-gordon equation @xcite and for sinh - poisson equation @xcite . just as in the general case of nonlinear differential equations which are exctly integrable by the algebraic - geometric procedure , we start from a configuration which is specified initially . by contrast with other equations ( for example kdv , etc ) where the variables are space and time and the unknown function",
    "is given at @xmath34 , here the coordinates are both spatial .",
    "then the conditions to be specified are boundary conditions , for example taken on the lines @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "consider that a certain flow configuration is specified ( for example from experimental measurements ) and the boundary conditions are specified in the form of two functions @xmath37 for @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath40 is much smaller than the radius of the circle on which the asymptotic value of the vorticity is given .",
    "the `` initial '' values of the unknown function is introduced in the lax operator eigenvalue problem . solving this problem",
    "we identify a set of eigenvalues ( the lax operator spectrum , see @xcite ) and the corresponding eigenfunctions with periodicity properties ( bloch functions ) .",
    "it is a general situation that in the spectrum there is a subset of eigenvalues for which the two eigenfunctions are identical .",

    "main spectrum_.    using the main spectrum one can construct the hyperelliptic riemann surface associated with the wronskian of the eigenfunctions . for a two by two lax operator , ( i.e. hyperelliptic riemann surface )",
    "the monodromy problem is simple .",
    "one has to define on this surface the dual homological sets : cycles and differential one - forms .",
    "then the period matrices can be calculated .    using the inverse of the @xmath20-period matrix one can generate the variables ( the phases ) appearing in the arguments of the riemann _ theta _ function .",
    "finally , one can calculate the solution at any point @xmath41 and can represent it graphically on a space domain .      from a detailed consideration of lax pairs found by forest and mclaughlin for the _ sine_-gordon equation @xcite",
