    "while ferromagnetism is known since antiquity , antiferromagnetism was only discovered in this century .",
    "it is not widely known that the concept of antiferromagnetic order was proposed independently by nel@xcite in 1932 and landau@xcite in 1933 . both",
    "sought to explain the , at that time , puzzling low temperature behavior of the magnetic susceptibility of certain materials : of metals such as cr and mn in the case of nel , and of insulators with layered structure such as the chlorides of cr , bivalent fe , co and ni in the case of landau . while nel correctly suggested the existence of interpenetrating sublattices in cr and mn with opposite magnetization @xcite , landau",
    "equally correctly predicted the existence of stacks of ferromagnetically ordered layers whose magnetization alternates from layer to layer @xcite . in both cases",
    "the total spontaneous magnetization adds up to zero . assuming the interlayer coupling to be weak",
    ", landau @xcite argued that a relatively small magnetic field would be sufficient to modify the mutual orientation of the moments in each layer .",
    "this leads to deviations from the linear dependence of the total moment on the field , i.e.  to an anomalous increase of the susceptibility , and finally  at high fields  to a saturation of the magnetization .",
    "such a behavior was indeed observed by becquerel and van den handel in 1939 @xcite in the mineral mesitite ( carbonate of fe and mg ) at low temperatures .",
    "not being aware of landau s or nel s work they could not explain their observation in terms of ferro- and paramagnetism , and therefore suggested for it the name metamagnetism @xcite .",
    "qualitatively similar , but even more drastic magnetization effects were later observed in many other systems of which fecl@xmath3 and dy@xmath4al@xmath5o@xmath6 ( dag ) are well - studied prototypes @xcite .",
    "these materials are insulators where the valence electrons are localized at the fe and dy ions , respectively .",
    "the resulting local moments order antiferromagnetically and are constrained to lie along an easy axis @xmath7 , implying a strong anisotropy such that a spin ",
    "flop transition can not occur .",
    "under the influence of a large magnetic field @xmath8 the staggered magnetization vanishes in a first or second order phase transition , the so  called metamagnetic transition .",
    "apart from the thoroughly investigated materials mentioned above , there are also conducting systems in that class , e.g.  uranium  based mixed systems @xcite , smmn@xmath3ge@xmath3 @xcite , and tbrh@xmath9ir@xmath10si@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "today the term `` metamagnetic transition '' is used in a much wider sense @xcite , namely whenever the homogeneous susceptibility @xmath11 has a maximum at some value @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being strongly enhanced for @xmath14 .",
    "metamagnetism is then found to be a rather common phenomenon which occurs also in spin ",
    "flop antiferromagnets ( e.g.  the parent compound of high - t@xmath15 superconductivity , la@xmath3cuo@xmath16 @xcite ) , strongly exchange - enhanced paramagnets ( e.g.  tibe@xmath3 , yco@xmath3 @xcite ) , heavy fermion and intermediate valence systems ( e.g.  ceru@xmath3si@xmath3 , upt@xmath4 @xcite ) .    in this paper we will be concerned only with metamagnetism in strongly anisotropic antiferromagnets , several of which are known to have a very interesting @xmath17 phase diagram ( @xmath18 : _ internal _ magnetic field , @xmath19 : temperature ) . in particular ,",
    "in the insulating systems one often finds a tricritical point at which the first order phase transition becomes second order .",
    "theoretical investigations of tricritical points began with the work of landau , who described multicritical behavior within his phenomenological theory of phase transitions@xcite .",
    "clearly , a genuine understanding of the origin of tricritical points etc .  requires investigations on a more microscopic level . in the case of",
    "strongly anisotropic metamagnets those investigations where sofar restricted to the insulating systems , such as febr@xmath3 .",
    "they are usually based on the ising model with more than one interaction , in a magnetic field , on a simple cubic lattice @xcite , e.g. @xmath20 where the summations extend over the nearest neighbors ( nn ) and next nearest neighbors ( nnn ) of every site . for @xmath21",
    "one has an antiferromagnetic ( af ) coupling between the @xmath22 nearest neighbor spins and a ferromagnetic coupling between the @xmath23 next nearest neighbors @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out by kincaid and cohen @xcite that in mean  field theory a tricritical point @xcite as in fig .",
    "1a exists only for @xmath24 , while for @xmath25 this point separates into a critical endpoint ( ce ) and a bicritical endpoint ( bce ) ( see fig .",
    "1b ) . the latter behavior , especially the finite angle between the two transition lines at ce and the pronounced maximum at the second order line , is qualitatively very similar to that observed in febr@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , the first order line between ce and bce has so far not been observed  neither experimentally , nor even theoretically when evaluating ( [ gl1 ] ) beyond mean  field theory @xcite .",
    "most recently , by measurement of the excess magnetization and anomalous susceptibility loss @xcite , the specific heat @xcite , and by neutron scattering @xcite a strip  shaped regime of strong _ non  critical _ fluctuations in the @xmath26 plane ( where @xmath27 is the applied field ) of febr@xmath3 was reported which is at least reminiscent of the _ critical _ line ce @xmath28 bce .",
    "this unusual behavior was then also found theoretically by selke @xcite who evaluated ( [ gl1 ] ) and also a more detailed model @xcite for weak ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath29 ) and large @xmath22 using monte carlo techniques .",
    "there does not yet exist a microscopic theory for the conducting systems such as the uranium  based mixed systems @xcite , because this requires a fully quantum mechanical treatment of _ itinerant , _ correlated electrons .",
    "first steps in this direction , where genuine correlation effects were , however , neglected , are the semi  phenomenological theories of wohlfarth and rhodes @xcite for metamagnetic phase transitions in paramagnets , and of moriya and usami @xcite for the coexistence of ferro- and antiferromagnetism in itinerant electron systems .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to examine the origin of metamagnetism in strongly anisotropic antiferromagnets from a microscopic , quantum mechanical point of view . to this end",
    "we will study the hubbard model in the presence of a strong anisotropy direction , with a magnetic field along this direction , since it is the simplest microscopic model that describes insulating _ and _ metallic , spin ",

    "the hubbard model in the form of ( [ hub ] ) can not describe metamagnetic behavior .",
    "the hubbard model is isotropic in spin space and hence the antiferromagnetic phase described by it is isotropic , too .",
    "consequently , any finite magnetic field @xmath35 will orient the staggered magnetization @xmath0 _ perpendicular _ to itself .",
    "real antiferromagnets are , however , never isotropic in spin space : the relativistic spin ",

    "the kinetic energy and the coulomb interaction are treated microscopically , whereas the relativistic corrections are not .",
    "we note that the relativistic corrections are of the order of @xmath41 ev and are thus small compared to energies of the order of @xmath42 ev for kinetic and coulomb energy .",
    "therefore the existence of @xmath7 and the correlation physics described by the hubbard model ( [ hub ] ) are quite unrelated .",
    "this justifies our approach where the existence of @xmath7 is _ a priori _ assumed @xcite .",
    "for classical spin models ( e.g.  the ising model ) it is well known that the weiss molecular field theory becomes exact in the limit of high spatial dimensions ( @xmath44 ) . for lattice electrons",
