    "in this section , based on the haldane model described by eq.([km ] ) , we study the topological insulator with multi - flux , including the two - flux case , and the triangular flux - superlattice case .",
    "firstly , we consider the ti with two well separated @xmath0-fluxes ( for example , the distance between two fluxes is @xmath21 ) .",
