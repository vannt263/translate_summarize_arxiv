    "mueller - navelet jets @xcite in hadron - hadron scattering are two jets produced in each of the forward directions . in standard perturbative qcd calculations , the partonic cross section is computed at fixed order with respect to the strong coupling @xmath0 while the large logarithms coming from the strong ordering between the hadronic scales and the jets transverse momenta are resummed using the dglap evolution equation for the parton densities . in the high - energy regime ,",
    "in which the jets are separated by a large rapidity interval , other large logarithms arise in the hard cross section itself , due to the strong ordering between the total energy and the hard scales .",
    "these can be resummed using the bfkl equation , up to next - leading ( nll ) logarithmic accuracy @xcite .",
    "although the nll corrections are accompanied by spurious singularities due to the truncation of the bfkl expansion at a fixed order , it was realised that renormalisation - group constrained regularisations can cure the problem and lead to reasonable nll - bfkl kernels . while phenomenological studies still require approximations , strong hints of nll - bfkl effects have been observed in forward - jet production in lepton - hadron collisions @xcite .",
    "the present study is devoted to the correlation in azimuthal angle between mueller - navelet jets in hadron - hadron collisions .",
    "the goal is to motivate this feasible measurement at the tevatron ( run 2 ) and at the lhc .",
    "we denote @xmath1 the total energy of the collision , @xmath2 and @xmath3 the transverse momenta of the two forward jets and @xmath4 and @xmath5 their rapidities .",
    "@xmath6 measures the relative azimuthal angle between the two jets , as @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the jets angles in the plane transerve to the collision axis .",
    "we shall work with the following kinematic variables : @xmath9    we are interested in an observable that is suitable to study the azimuthal decorrelation of the jets as a function of their rapidity separation @xmath10 and of the ratio of their transverse momenta @xmath11 @xmath12 we have expressed the normalized cross - section ( [ obs ] ) in terms of the fourier coefficients @xmath13 given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the longitudinal fraction of momentum of the jets with respect to the incident hadrons . in the high - energy regime in which the rapidity interval between the two jets is assumed to be very large , they are given by @xmath17 and @xmath18    the effective parton distribution @xmath19 resums the large logarithms @xmath20 it is given by @xmath21 in terms of @xmath22 ( resp .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , the gluon ( resp .",
    "quark , antiquark ) distribution in the incident hadron .",
    "since the mueller - navelet jet measurement involves perturbative values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 and moderate values of @xmath15 and @xmath25 the cross - section features the collinear factorization of @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 chosen as factorization scales .    in ( [ coeff ] )",
    ", we choose to apply the rapidity cuts @xmath29 to enforce the symmetric situation @xmath30 for the transverse momentum cut @xmath31 we will consider two options : @xmath32 for the tevatron ( run 2 ) and @xmath33 for the lhc .",
    "we recall that the respective center - of - mass energies are @xmath34 and @xmath35    the bfkl green function @xmath36 is the main object of the study , it resums the large logarithms @xmath37 at nll accuracy , there is an ambiguity corresponding to the specific regularisation procedure . the results displayed in the following are obtained with the s4 scheme of @xcite .",
    "there are many complications when performing a full nll calculation in the bfkl framework .",
    "in fact , in formula ( [ coeff ] ) , we have already made the approximation to use leading - order impact factors .",
    "dealing with next - to - leading order impact factors is possible , but goes beyond the scope of our study .",
    "the nll - bfkl green function is given by @xmath38\\delta\\eta}\\ ] ] with the qcd running coupling @xmath39^{-1}$ ] where @xmath40    the nll - bfkl effects are phenomenologically taken into account by the effective kernel @xmath41 for each value of @xmath42 the nll - bfkl kernels provided by the regularisation procedure @xmath43 depend on @xmath44 the mellin variable conjugate to @xmath45 and @xmath46 the mellin variable conjugate to @xmath47 in each case , the nll kernels obey a consistency condition @xcite which allows to reformulate the problem in terms of the effective kernel @xmath48 it is obtained from the nll kernel @xmath43 by solving the implicit equation @xmath49 the nll - bfkl kernel @xmath43 is given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where the regularisation procedure of @xcite is extended to nonzero conformal spins @xmath50 finally , we point out that our nll - bfkl predictions are parameter free .",
    "in general , the @xmath51 distribution ( [ obs ] ) is peaked around @xmath52 which is indicative of jet emissions occuring back - to - back .",
    "in addition the @xmath51 distribution flattens with increasing @xmath10 or with @xmath53 deviating from 1 . in the left part of fig.1",
    ", we display the observable ( [ obs ] ) as a function of @xmath51 , for tevatron ( top ) and lhc ( bottom ) kinematics respectively , and we test the sensitivity of our results when using @xmath54 or @xmath55 as the renormalization scale .",
    "the scale dependence turns out to be quite small , of about 5 percent , except for @xmath51 close to 0 , in which case the uncertainty reaches 20 percent .    on the right plot ,",
    "predictions for the @xmath51 distribution with cdf kinematics are presented .",
    "due to miniplug detectors in the forward and backward regions which allow to increase the acceptance in rapidity and transverse momentum to measure very forward jets , it will indeed be possible to measure jets separated in rapidity by more than 10 units and with transverse momenta as low as @xmath56 with such low values of transverse momenta and large values of rapidity interval between the two jets , it is also likely that saturation effects could play an important role .",
    "first estimations @xcite ( with less favorable kinematics ) indicate so when considering saturation effets damping the ll - bfkl exponential growth .",
    "the implementation of saturation effects with the nll - bfkl growth certainly deserves to be studied .",
