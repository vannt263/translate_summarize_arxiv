    "chemical evolution ( ce ) models follow the formation , destruction , abundance , and spatial and stellar distribution of elements created during the nucleosynthesis era of the big bang , and the different evolutionary stages in stars .",
    "models are pitted against a host of observational test , such as the relative abundances of the various elements and their isotopes in meteorites , stars , and in the interstellar , intergalactic and intracluster media , the g - dwarf metallicity distribution , and the age - metallicity relation of the various systems [ e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "ce models provide a natural framework for studying the evolution of dust since the abundance of the elements locked up in dust must be constrained by the availability of refractory elements in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "ce models need then to be generalized to include processes unique to the evolution of dust : the condensation efficiency of refractory elements in stellar ejecta , the destruction of grains in the ism by expanding supernova remnants ( snrs ) , and the growth and coagulation of grains in clouds @xcite",
    ".    the first dust evolution models @xcite ( hereafter ds ) addressed the origin of the elemental depletion pattern , which was a subject of considerable debate .",
    "@xcite showed that the depletion pattern correlated with condensation temperature , suggesting that it reflects the condensation efficiency of the elements in their respective sources .",
    "such causal correlation requires that dust undergoes very little interstellar processing that can alter the depletion pattern .",
    "an equally good correlation exists between the magnitude of the elements depletion and their first ionization potential @xcite , suggesting that the depletion pattern may instead be governed by accretion processes in molecular clouds . pointing out the intrinsic physical correlation between the condensation temperature , the first ionization potential , and the threshold for grain destruction by sputtering",
    ", ds suggested that the depletion pattern could reflect the destruction efficiency of dust in the ism .",
    "it is currently clear that all three processes play some role in establishing the elemental depletion pattern , since it depends on the density of the medium in which it is observed @xcite .",
    "globally , their relative importance depends on the prevalence of and the cycling times between the different phases ( hot , neutral , and molecular ) of the ism .",
    "a more detailed review of dust evolution models is given by @xcite .",
    "since then , several models have been constructed to follow the evolution of dust in dwarf galaxies @xcite , damped ly@xmath2 systems @xcite , the milky way galaxy @xcite , and the origin of isotopic anomalies in meteorites @xcite .",
    "early dust evolution models adopted the instantaneous recycling approximation , which assumes that all the elements and dust are promptly injected back into the ism following the formation of their nascent stars .",
    "in contrast @xcite and @xcite constructed models that take the finite main sequence ( ms ) lifetimes of the stars into account .",
    "silicate dust is primarily produced in supernovae ( sn ) that `` instantaneously '' recycle their products back to the ism , whereas carbon dust is mainly produced in low - mass carbon - rich stars which have significantly longer ms lifetimes .",
    "consequently these models predicted that the composition of the dust should evolve as a function of time .",
    "dust evolution models contain many still uncertain parameters such as the dust yields in the various sources and the grain destruction efficiency in the ism .",
    "however , in spite of these uncertainties we will show that they can be very successful in predicting global evolutionary trends , namely the observed correlation of the abundance of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules with metallicity , and in examining the origin of dust in the high - redshift universe .",
    "the dust condensation efficiency , and its composition and size distribution depend very much on the environment in which it is formed .",
    "dust can form in the quiescent outflows of agb or wolf - rayet stars , or in the explosively expelled ejecta of sne and novae .",
    "there is substantial observational evidence for the formation of dust in all these sources , however , their relative importance as sources of interstellar dust , and the composition and size distribution of the condensed dust are still uncertain , especially in sne .",
    "because of the ease of formation and stability of the co molecule , dust sources can be divided into two categories : carbon - rich sources , in which the c / o abundance ratio is larger than 1 .",
    "these sources will produce carbon dust ; and oxygen - rich sources with c / o @xmath3 1 , which will produce silicate - type dust .",
    "such simple arguments assume that co formation goes to completion , which may not always be the case , as suggested by the dynamical condensation models of @xcite .",
    "sn explosions mark the death of stars more massive than @xmath4  @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ snejecta ] depicts the post - explosive composition of a 25  @xmath1  star @xcite .",
    "it depicts a typical onion - skin structure in which the composition of the different layers reflect the pre- and post - explosion nuclear burning stages of the star .",
    "globally , the ejecta has a c / o ratio @xmath3  1 , and should in principle be only producing silicate dust .",
    "however , in spite of the mixing between the layers caused by rayleigh - taylor instabilities in the ejecta , this mixing is of macroscopic nature and does not occur on an atomic level .",
    "so the layers above above @xmath5  @xmath1 , in which c / o @xmath6  1 , will maintain this ratio and produce carbon dust , whereas the inner layers will produce silicates .",
    "if all condensible elements precipitated out of the ejecta and formed dust , the yield of dust in a typical sn would be about 1  @xmath1  @xcite .",

    "stars with masses above @xmath7  @xmath1  produce carbon and silicate dust , irrespective of the global c / o ratio in their ejecta .",
    "the mass range of carbon rich stars depends on the initial stellar metallicity . at zero metallicity ( left panel )",
    "the mass range of stars producing carbon dust is between 0.8 and 7.8  @xmath1 .",
    "this range narrows significantly to masses between 3.0 and 3.6  @xmath1  at solar metallicity ( right panel ) .",
    "figure [ co ] presents a qualitative depiction of the method we use to calculate the yield of carbon and silicate dust in agb stars .",
    "a more realistic model calculating the yield of dust in agb stars was presented by @xcite and hoefner ( 2009 , this conference proceedings ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "figure [ chemvol ] compares the evolution of the pahs and dust components derived from the dust evolution model to the trend of pah abundances with metallicity . for the sake of this comparison ,",
    "the evolution of dust abundances as a function of time was converted to an evolution as a function of metallicity , using the age - metallicity relation derived in the model .",
    "we emphasize that the parameters used in the dust evolution model ( the star formation rate , the stellar imf ) were identical to those used in the population synthesis model that was used to fit the galaxies sed . from the dust evolution model we already derived the two distinct evolutionary trends of sn- and agb - condensed dust ( see fig .",
    "[ pahvol ] , right panel for the idealized example ) .",
    "the current figure compares these results with the derived abundance of the pahs and of the dust that gives rise to the far - ir emission .",
    "the latter is dominated by emission from silicates , and should therefore follow the trend of the sn condensates , since most silicate grains are produced in sne .",
    "the figure shows that the observed far - ir emitting dust falls on the evolutionary track of the calculated sn - condensed dust , and that the observed pah abundances fall on the evolutionary track of the carbon dust that formed in agb stars .",
    "the shaded regions in the figure represent the range of evolutionary tracks that correspond to different parameters that determine the star formation rate and grain destruction efficiencies in the models .",
    "the detection of massive amounts of dust in hyperluminous ir galaxies at redshifts @xmath8 raises challenging questions about the sources capable of producing such large amount of dust during the relatively short lifetime of these galaxies @xcite . for example , the galaxy sdss j1148 + 5251 ( hereafter j1148 + 5251 ) located at @xmath9 was observed at far - ir and submillimeter wavelength @xcite .",
    "the average ir luminosity of the source is @xmath10  @xmath11 , and the average dust mass is @xmath12  @xmath1 . using the @xcite relation , one can derive a star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath13  @xmath1  yr@xmath14 from the observed far - ir luminosity . for comparison , the milky way galaxy is about 10  gyr old , has an average sfr of @xmath15  @xmath1  yr@xmath14 , and contains about @xmath16  @xmath1  of dust , a significant fraction of which was produced in agb stars .    at @xmath17",
    "the universe was only 890  myr old , using standard @xmath18cdm parameters ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21  km  s@xmath14  mpc@xmath14 ) .",
    "if j1148 + 5251  formed at @xmath22 then the galaxy is only 400  myr old .",
    "if the sfr had occured at a constant rate over the lifetime of the galaxy , its initial mass should have been about 10@xmath23  @xmath1 , which is significantly larger than the dynamical mass @xmath24  @xmath1  of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the high observed sfr may therefore represent a recent burst of star formation that has lasted for only about 20  myr .",
    "the galaxy j1148 + 5251  is therefore at most @xmath25  myr old , and probably significantly younger with an age of only @xmath26  myr . adopting a current gas mass of @xmath27  @xmath1  for this galaxy",
    "we get that the gas mass fraction at 400  myr is about 0.60 .",
    "the dust - to - gas mass ratio is given by @xmath28 .",
    "a significant fraction of the dust in the milky way was produced in agb stars .",
    "however , these stars are not likely to contribute significantly to the formation of dust in very young galaxies , since the low mass stars ( @xmath29  @xmath1 ) that produce most of the dust did not have time to evolve off the main sequence @xcite .",
    "in contrast , core collapse sne ( @xmath30  @xmath1 ) and their post - main - sequence progenitors inject their nucleosynthetic products back into the ism shortly ( @xmath31  myr ) after their formation , resulting in the rapid enrichment of the interstellar medium ( ism ) with the dust that formed during the mass loss phase prior to the sn event , or in the explosive sn ejecta .",
    "we will hereafter attribute both contribution to the sn event , since both are return `` promptly '' to the ism .",
    "but can sne account for the large amount of dust seen in this object ?",
    "the answer to this question is complicated by the fact that sne are also the main source of grain destruction during the remnant phase of their evolution @xcite .",
    "the problem can therefore only be quantitatively addressed with ce models for the dust in these systems .",
    "the results of the detailed dust evolution models described summarized in figure [ chemvol ] show that the contribution of agb stars to metal and dust abundance can be neglected in galaxies with ages less than about 400  myr .",
    "the equations for the chemical evolution of the galaxy can then be considerably simplified using the instantaneous recycling approximation , which assumes that stars return their ejecta back to the ism promply after their formation .",
    "the evolution of the dust abundance can then be written in analytical form @xcite .",
    "in particular , the yield of dust , @xmath32 , required to obtain a given dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath33 , when the galaxy reaches a given gas mass fraction @xmath34 , is given by @xcite : @xmath35 \\label{ydzd}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath36 @xmath37 is the fraction of the stellar mass that is returned back to the ism during the stellar lifetime , @xmath38  is given by eq .",

    "figure [ snyield ] shows how much dust an average sn _ must _ produce in order to give rise to a given dust - to - gas mass ratio , for various grain destruction efficiencies .",
    "the value of @xmath32  was calculated when @xmath34  reaches a value of 0.60 , the adopted gas mass fraction of j1148 + 5251  at 400  myr .",
    "calculations were performed for two different functional forms of the stellar imf : a salpeter imf in which @xmath42 and @xmath43(@xmath1 ) @xmath44 ; and a top heavy imf characterized by the same mass limits but a flatter slope @xmath45 .",
    "here , @xmath46 is the number of stars per unit mass interval , normalized to unity between 0.1 and 100  @xmath1 .",
    "the figure shows that , for example , to produce a value of @xmath47 at @xmath34=  0.60 , a sn must produce about 0.4  ( 1.2 )  @xmath1  of dust for a top - heavy ( salpeter ) imf , provided the dust is not destroyed in the ism , that is , @xmath38",
    "= 0 . even with modest amount of grain destruction , @xmath38  = 100  @xmath1 , the required sn dust yield is dramatically increased to about @xmath48  @xmath1 , depending on the imf .",

    "contrary to the claim by @xcite , this yield is not sufficient to account for the large amount of dust observed in high redshift galaxies , since the quoted chemical evolution models of @xcite do not include the effect of grain destruction .",
    "the figure shows that even without grain destruction , the largest observed yield can only give rise to a dust - to - gas mass ratio of @xmath49 .",

    "dust evolution models have proven to be very successful in predicting global evolutionary trends in dust abundance and composition , and in analyzing the origin of dust in the early universe .",
    "an important prediction of these models is that sn- and agb - condensed dust should follow distinct evolutionary paths because of the different stellar evolutionary tracks of their progenitor stars . by analyzing the uv - to - radio sed of 35 nearby galaxies we have identified silicates and pahs , respectively , as tracers of sn- and agb - condensed dust . our sed fitting procedure used chemical evolution , dust evolution , and population synthesis models in a consistent fashion .",
    "the models used the free - free and mid - ir emissions to constrain the gas and dust radiation from the gas and dust from h  ii regions , and the far - ir and optical emission to constrain the isrf that heats the dust in pdrs .",
    "the observed correlation of the intensity of the mid - ir emission from pahs with their metallicity can then be interpreted as the result of stellar evolutionary effects which cause the delayed injection of carbon dust into the interstellar medium .",
    "the early universe is a unique environment for studying the role of massive stars in the formation and destruction of dust .",
    "the equations describing their chemical evolution can be greatly simplified by using the instantaneous recycling approximation , and by neglecting the delayed contribution of low mass stars to the metal and dust abundance of the ism . neglecting any accretion of metals onto pre - existing dust in the interstellar medium ,",
    "the evolution of the dust is then primarily determined by the condensation efficiency of refractory elements in the ejecta of type  ii supernovae , and the destruction efficiency of dust by sn blast waves .",
    "we applied our general results to j1148 + 5251 , a dusty , hyperluminous quasar at redshift @xmath9 and found that the formation of a dust mass fraction of @xmath47 in a galaxy with an ism mass of @xmath52  @xmath1 , requires an average sn to produce between 0.5 and 1  @xmath1  of dust if there was no grain destruction .",
