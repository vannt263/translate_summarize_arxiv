    "since all evidence we have so far for the current cosmic acceleration are indirect  @xcite , extracting the evolution of these two parameters from future redshift surveys constitutes one of the major challenges in observational cosmology may also reduce the so - called smearing effect that makes constraining the dark energy equation of state ( eos ) @xmath1 extremely difficult  @xcite . ] .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate how well cosmography may provide a model - independent way to check the reality of cosmic acceleration .",
    "specifically , we study the evolution of the deceleration parameter from the @xmath0 data which are to become available by some planned projects . to this end",
    ", we performed a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation based on @xmath1cdm models ( of which the @xmath7cdm model is a special case with @xmath8 , where @xmath9 stands for the dark energy pressure and @xmath10 for its energy density ) .",
    "we generated three samples of @xmath0 with increasing accuracy and derived @xmath2 from numerical differentiation .",
    "we show that a comographic evidence for cosmic acceleration will be possible only with a great ( maybe out of the perspective of current planned surveys ) accuracy in @xmath0 data .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the determination of @xmath2 will also allow us to estimate the transition redshift , @xmath4 , which corresponds to the epoch when the hubble expansion switched from a decelerating to an accelerating phase . since @xmath11 , the same technique",
    "can also be used to map the recent past evolution of @xmath12 in a given model of dark energy .",
    "recently , it has been shown that luminous red galaxies ( lrg s ) can provide us with direct measurements of the expansion rate @xmath0  @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent review on @xmath0 measurements from different techniques ) at different redshifts will also be possible through measurements of the line - of - sight or radial component of baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao ) from large redshift surveys with redshift precision of the order of @xmath13 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . ] .",
    "this can be done by calculating the derivative of cosmic time with respect to redshift @xmath14 from measurements of age difference between two passively evolving galaxies at different @xmath15 .",
    "simon , verde and jimenez  @xcite ( svj ) have demonstrated the feasibility of directly measuring @xmath0 using this differential age method and have provided 9 determinations of the expansion rate at @xmath16 .",
    "more recently , stern _",
    "_ @xcite have updated svj sample to 11 estimates of @xmath0 lying in the redshift interval @xmath17 .",
    "new age - redshift datasets for different galaxy velocity dispersion groups ( 7 lrg s sample ) have also been made available by the sdss collaboration  @xcite .",
    "@xcite have also pointed out that in the near future , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) is expected to provide observations of over 500 galaxy cluster up to @xmath18 .",
    "this , together with spectra to be acquired in other telescopes in chile and southern african large telescope ( salt ) in south africa , will provide a sample of more than 2000 passively evolving galaxies in the redshift range @xmath19 . from these observations , it will be possible to determine @xmath20 values of the hubble parameter at a @xmath21 accuracy level if the ages of the galaxies are estimated with @xmath22 error .    following a similar approach , crawford _ et al .",
    "@xcite examined the observational requirements to estimate @xmath0 to a given precision . in their simulation ,",
    "observations of lrg s are made at two redshifts , namely , @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( average @xmath25 ) and they supposed that uncertainty on ages of individuals galaxies lies in the range @xmath26 gyr .",
    "they estimated that the uncertainty on the mean ages will be 0.10 , 0.05 and @xmath27 gyr and that hubble parameter can be measured with a precision of @xmath22 , 5% and @xmath28 .",
    "a study was also made on the constraints upon the exposure time per galaxy and number of galaxies observed .",
    "they concluded that with a total time of 17 , 72 and 184 hours , observing 80 , 327 and 840 galaxies on the southern african large telescope , will make possible to recover @xmath0 to 10% , 5% and @xmath28 accuracy , respectively  @xcite ( private communication ) .",
    "[ fig3 ]    [ fig2 ]",
    "in our analyses , we perform monte carlo simulations which provide us with samples of @xmath0 based on the flat @xmath7cdm model . for each `` measurement '' , we assume a gaussian distribution of @xmath0 centered at the value predicted by a flat @xmath1cdm with @xmath29 with a standard deviation corresponding to the percentage accuracy predicted in future experiments",
    ". we shall examine two cases based on the projections made in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite . for the former case , we simulated 1000 data points for @xmath0 , uniformly distributed between @xmath30 and @xmath31 with @xmath21 precision . in the latter case , we simulated 15 measurements of the hubble parameter between redshifts 0 and 1.5 and equally spaced ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we take the errors estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite when recovering @xmath0 from lrg s ages , namely 10% , 5% and @xmath28 .",
    "note that in the last case ( the one explored throughout this paper ) , one needs 8400 lrg s in the whole interval @xmath33 . in all our simulations ,",
    "we have adopted @xmath34 km / s / mpc , which corresponds to the central value given in ref .",
    "@xcite based on differential measurements of cepheids variable observations and @xmath35 , as given by current cmb measurements  @xcite .",
    "figure 1a shows one realization of 1000 simulated values of @xmath0 with @xmath21 accuracy according to ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath15 in the range ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the binned data points of this realization ( with a bin width @xmath32 ) are shown in figure 1b .",
    "the error bars correspond to the standard deviation around the mean of individual values of @xmath0 within each bin , which contains approximately 67 galaxies . for comparison ,",
    "the observed values given in @xcite are also shown . in figure 1c",
    "we show the results of one mc realization taking the errors estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite with the resulting @xmath0 data points at @xmath28 accuracy .    from the above @xmath0 simulated data",
    ", one may derive evolution of the deceleration parameter @xmath2 , defined as @xmath37(1+z)-1.\\ ] ] in order to do that one needs to compute the derivative of the @xmath0 with respect to the redshift .",
    "however , while integration tends to smooth out data fluctuations , numerical differentiation tends to magnify errors and the scatter of the points .",
    "thus , depending on the degree of scatter of @xmath0 measurements , the gradient estimation may be useless . for equally spaced points ,",
    "the derivative is calculated using finite difference approximation , that is , @xmath38/2\\delta z$ ] , where @xmath39 .",
    "we then substitute this into ( [ q1 ] ) and calculate @xmath40 and the associated uncertainty by using the standard error propagation method .    for our first simulation , shown in figures 1a and 1b , we use the binned points since the large scatter of the raw data makes them useless .",
    "the resulting values of the deceleration parameter from the mc realization of figure 1b are shown in figure 2a .",
    "although the points lie near the predicted curve of the @xmath7cdm model ( black curve ) , we can not expect a definitive evidence for a recent cosmic acceleration from these simulated @xmath0 sample with @xmath21 accuracy .",
    "note that the same is also true even when the evolution of @xmath2 is derived from the 15 data points with @xmath28 accuracy following @xcite ( fig .",
    "in this case , although the error of individual points is smaller , the determination of the deceleration parameter is less precise with considerable scattering of points and error bars allowing both a decelerating and accelerating universe today .    in order to quantify the above results",
    ", we also performed 1000 mc realizations to calculate the mean of the absolute values of the difference between the calculated and the background model values of @xmath41 , that is , @xmath42 we plot this quantity for both cases discussed above in figures 2c ( 1000 binned points ) and 2d ( 15 points ) , with the error bars representing the standard deviation from the mean . as we see , @xmath43 has a weak dependence on redshift for the first case and in the interval @xmath44 it lies in the range @xmath45 , although the uncertainty is relatively large . from figure 2d",
    "we see that the departure of the calculated @xmath46 from the expected value given by the model is larger than in former case , with @xmath43 varying from 0.2 to 0.4 .",
    "this clearly reflects the large scattering of points shown in figure 2b .    in view of the above results",
    ", we also speculated about how precise should future observations be in order to provide a clear evidence for cosmic acceleration from cosmography .",
    "we did that for the method proposed in @xcite and found that it will give very good results if the accuracy is improved to as much as @xmath47 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 3 . in this case",
    ", the calculated value of @xmath46 is very close to the @xmath7cdm model predictions in almost the entire range of @xmath15 and the deviation from the expected value is as low as 0.07 and always @xmath48 .",
    "naturally , the observational requirements for this case would be much more stringent than the previous ones , with the need of thousand galaxies and more observational time as well .",
    "by considering a dark - energy dominated universe , a step further in the above discussion concerns the reconstruction of its equation - of - state parameter @xmath1 from measurements of @xmath0 . in order to be consistent with the simulations presented earlier , we consider accelerating @xmath1cdm models with @xmath1 lying in the interval [ -1/3 , -3/2 ] . in this context ,",
    "( [ q1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the current fractional contribution of dark energy to the critical density .",
    "note that such procedure does not involve several integrations of @xmath12 , as in cosmological tests based on age or distance measurements and , therefore , may reduce the smearing effect on @xmath12 determinations discussed earlier ( see also @xcite for a different approach ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the evolution of @xmath1 with redshift calculated from the simulated measurements of @xmath0 using the method proposed of ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath47 accuracy .",
    "although the input model ( @xmath29 ) is fairly recovered , we note that the estimated errors of the dark energy eos ( @xmath51 ) increase considerably at the upper end of the redshift range .",
    "this can be more easily understood after solving eq .",
    "( [ wz ] ) for @xmath1 and calculating @xmath51 , which depends strongly on a competition between the different terms of eq .",
    "( [ wz ] ) at the @xmath15 interval considered . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we also performed the same analysis for the other two cases ( with 15% and 3% accuracy in @xmath0 ) discussed earlier . in both",
    ", the scattering of the points is large enough to hamper any definitive conclusion on the expected evolution of the cosmic equation of state .",
    "[ fig3 ]    cosmography explores the possibility of extracting the maximum amount of information from cosmological measurements , as well as the assumption that the universe can be modeled by the friedmann - robertson - walker line element without assuming any dynamical theory to describe it . in this paper , differently from many analyses that study the current phase of cosmic evolution in the context of a given cosmological model , we have investigated the prospects for a cosmographic mapping of cosmic acceleration using two different projections of age determinations of passively evolving galaxies recently discussed in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we have found that a model - independent check of the reality of cosmic acceleration requires very accurated measurements of the expasion rate ( @xmath52 ) , which seems to be far from the perspectives of current planned surveys . as a step further in this analysis",
    ", we have also used the direct relation between @xmath2 and @xmath12 to study possible constraints on the dark energy eos from future observations ( fig .",
    "4 ) .    finally",
    ", it is also worth emphasizing that the method discussed here can be applied regardless of the technique used to obtain @xmath0 measurements . in this regard",
    ", we note that @xmath0 measurements from radial bao methods ( despite the systematic errors introduced mainly by distortion effects ) surpasses the age method in precision and can extend the @xmath0 measurements into deeper redshift ranges  @xcite ( see also @xcite for expected measurements of expansion rate at @xmath53 by observing the lyman - forest absorption spectra of high-@xmath15 quasars ) .",
