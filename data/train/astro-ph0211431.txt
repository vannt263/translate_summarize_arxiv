    "blazars are active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , having a variable non - thermal continuum emission extending from radio to gamma - rays .",
    "egret discovered that blazars are the most powerful extragalactic @xmath2-ray sources up to gev energies .",
    "this emission is interpreted as due to a high energy radiating plasma region propagate downstream with shocks in an underlying jet , which itself moves at relativistic speed and points almost directly toward the observer ( e.g. blandford & rees 1978 ; dondi & ghisellini 1995 ; kollgaard et al .",
    "detailed studies of blazars flux variations may provide considerable information on the emitting region dynamics .",
    "the blazar monitoring in optical bands permit to discriminate among the proposed emission models and represent , together with multiwavelength observations , an indispensable tool to investigate physical mechanism and conditions in this objects .",
    "moreover it s important to reach sufficient quality , density and continuity of observations to permit significant statistical data analysis and to establish possible correlation with the x - ray and @xmath2-ray emission . in order to achieve the optical coverage necessary for this goal , ground - bases small telescope equipped with ccd camera , can play an important role thank to their large availability .",
    "the automatic imaging telescope ( ait ) of the perugia university is one of the first robotic telescope in the world , and it s dedicated to blazar observation since 1992 .",
    "general information about our telescope and blazar sample list can be found at ` http://wwwospg.pg.infn.it ` .",
    "the ait is based on an equatorially mounted 0.4-m newtonian reflector having a 0.15-m refractor . a ccd camera and johnson - cousins @xmath0 filters are utilized for photometry .",
    "the system , become full operative in october 1994 .",
    "it is equipped with an autoguider ( based on a ccd camera ) that is mounted at the focus of the refractor .",
    "the autoguider is also used to verify the correctness of each pointing and to monitor sky conditions .",
    "the control of the observatory during the night is now completely automated with the computers deciding the opening or the closing of the dome shutter , selecting the object from the observing list , setting and centering the telescope on the field , taking the desired ccd exposures , and reducing the data after the end of the night ( tosti , pascolini & fiorucci 1996 ) .",
    "our blazar sample contain about 40 blazar , contributing to get knowledge on the variability of many these sources . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bllac ] and [ fig : oj287 ] we report two example of light curve in @xmath3 band , while in fig .",
    "[ fig:0109 ] one example of a less famous source but indeed well monitored by us in three band .",
    "the relevant amount of data from the best monitored sources , allow us to perform a first statistical analysis to investigate the time variability characteristics and the light curves .",
    "we used the structure function ( sf ) defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the time lag and @xmath6 the flux , in a @xmath7 versus @xmath8 plot .",
    "it s similar to a sort of power spectrum suitable for nonperiodic data ( see , e. g. , hufnagel & bregman 1992 ) .    the sf slope @xmath9 is an interesting parameter because it highlights some basic properties of the light curves ( variability like shot noise , like flickering noise etc ... ) . in our sample",
    "the optical variability was generally characterized by an intermediate state between shot and flickering noise ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "shot noise has an infinite memory of all the preceding events ( @xmath11 ) , on the other hand flickering noise depends especially from the last events ( @xmath12 ) ( fiorucci et al .",
    "our result may suggest that the optical flares are produced in small - scale structures within the jet , such us shocks or plasma turbulence .    to optimize the blazar optical monitoring , important for developing a statistical data analysis and for correlation multiwavelength analysis",
    ", we need a stable collaboration among observers , an automatization of the telescopes and data reduction , a standard photometric and database systems ( e.g. villata & raiteri 2001 , mattox 1999 ) .",
    "0.4 cm * j. beckman : * i am very impressed with the quality and quantity of the observation made with a relatively small telecope",
    ". there must be many potential observers who could collaborate in such programm . what would you estimate to be the smallest telescope which could usefully take part in this kind of monitoring ?",
    "0.3 cm * n. smith : * how frequently do you observe `` single '' data points which are significantly above the surrounding data points and how real do you believe them to be ?",
    "do you see such data points in the lightcurves of your comparision stars ?",
    "0.3 cm * g. tosti : * sparse photometric points depend on the sampling condition ( weather and other ) but logs of observations and the ccd images are controlled one by one .",
    "moreover we can compare them with the observation in four - three filter and relevant peaks are confronted with data of other observatories ."
