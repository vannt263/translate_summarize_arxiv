    "the deviations are more drastic . in appendix [ gainpeak ]",
    "the occupation numbers in the gain region are calculated in second order time - dependent perturbation theory for the initial state for fermions and distinguishable particles and the results derived there can account very well for this difference .",
    "the physical content of eq.([nktgainacp ] ) ( agreeing with eq.([nktp2 ] ) ) and eq.([nktgainac ] ) is that a particle can be scattered into a higher momentum state with an amplitude @xmath263 by absorbing a phonon with momentum @xmath127 which was emitted previously by a different particle .",
    "this process has an exchange process where the initial and the final state are the same but the role of the two particles as an emitter and an absorber of the phonon are exchanged .",
    "the phonons exchanged in the two processes are different but this is irrelevant for the calculation of the fermionic momentum distribution . for fermions",
    "the occupation probability for a momentum state in the gain region is the absolute square of the sum of the amplitudes for the two processes which have a relative minus sign .",
    "for distinguishable particles on the other hand the two processes can be distinguished and the probability is the sum of the absolute square of the amplitudes for the individual processes . in fig.[6exc ] all the initially occupied momentum states are very close and consequently all the corresponding exchange processes have a similar amplitude leading to the reduction of the weight in the gain peak for the fermions . a more detailed discussion of @xmath263 is given in appendix [ gainpeak ] and it shows that the shorter the time the broader are the features of the amplitude and therefore the cancellation in eq.([nktp2 ] ) .    the interference effect contained in eq.([nktp2 ] )",
    "is not properly described by the usual quantum kinetic equations @xcite in which the collision term is treated in the born approximation but requires an improved treatment @xcite .",
    "the agreement of the two fermion system with the corresponding six particle system is very good - also for larger times .",
    "the momentum grid of the smaller system is different but the results for its momentum states nearly always agree with the results for the larger system .",
    "the approximation presented in eq.([gxtp ] ) agrees with the exact solution within the plotting accuracy .    in fig.[6excsc ] the distributions of the same six particle systems as in fig.[6exc ]",
    "are presented at time @xmath216 but with the coupling strength @xmath264 .",
    "consequently the relaxation process is more advanced and the peaks are smoother with a larger weight in the states between them . the approximation ( eq.([gxtp ] ) ) for the six indistinguishable particles - not shown in the figure for its clarity - gives values slightly too large for the central excitations and phonon peaks smaller than @xmath265 and larger than @xmath266 .    in fig.[33exc ]",
    "the results are shown for the same systems at the same time as in fig.[6excsc ] but again with the weaker coupling @xmath192 and different initial momenta . here",
    "the zero momentum state and the next two lower states are occupied and the second group of three particles has momenta shifted by @xmath267 .",
    "therefore in the six fermion system the three particles with larger momenta can not relax by emitting a resonant phonon .",
    "the distinguishable particles of course are not subject to this blocking and in contrast to fig.[6exc ] one can clearly see the large difference between the two systems in the negative momentum peaks .",
    "however the difference in the first gain peak is not as large as in fig.[6exc ] . for an explanation eq.([nktp2 ] ) is useful again .",
    "if one particle of the smaller and larger momentum group interact by phonon exchange the corresponding exchange process has a very different amplitude .",
    "in the one process a phonon with momentum @xmath222 will be absorbed and in the exchange process a phonon with momentum @xmath266 .",
    "consequently the contributions of the two processes do not cancel each other as much as in fig.[6exc ] . on the other hand processes involving two particles from the larger momentum group",
    "only do not contribute to the resonant states of the gain peak at all but the exclusion of these processes can not compensate the other effect and the difference between the fermions and the distinguishable particles is reduced .",
    "we have presented the exact analytical result for the time dependence of the electronic momentum distribution for a model with a linear electronic energy dispersion for a translationally invariant initial state with @xmath2 electrons and thermal phonons at temperature @xmath268 . in order to show as clearly as possible the difference between the @xmath78 `` polaron case '' and the new effects occurring for @xmath123 we have presented numerical results for @xmath269 only . while for distinguishable particles the influence function can be simply evaluated also for a finite _ density _ of particles in the thermodynamic limit , for fermions numerical results were presented only for finite particle number and system size .",
    "as shown in fig.[6exc ] for not too large times finite systems with different @xmath2 but the same _ density _ are very similar , which indicates that going to the thermodynamic limit is not very important .",
    "apart from the obvious effects of pauli - blocking interference effects play an important role which are not incorporated in quantum kinetic equations which treat the scattering term in the born approximation @xcite and @xcite . as interference effects are very important to correctly describe the gain process in the short time limit our exact results can serve as an excellent testing ground for improved quantum kinetic equations .      in this appendix we present analytical results for various integrals appearing in eqs.([nk1tres ] ) and ( [ gnxt ] ) for the model with a @xmath127-independent coupling function @xmath164 and @xmath270 .",
    "we first consider the integral                      with these results the @xmath280integration of the functions in the integrand of the momentum distribution eq.([nktip ] ) can be performed analytically for @xmath209 . as a function of the dimensionless momentum variable @xmath281 one obtains for @xmath282",
    "the functions obey the relations @xmath288 and @xmath289 which guarantee that @xmath290 is real . the first term on the rhs of eq.([butaui ] )",
    "is equal to @xmath291 which enters the weight @xmath292 and @xmath293 is given by                in this appendix we shortly describe our numerical method to calculate the momentum distribution for finite systems .",
    "it is a straightforward generalization of the technique used in @xcite .",
    "as one step of the procedure can actually be simplified considerably compared to @xcite , we first describe the method for the simplest case @xmath78 , the coupling function @xmath138 and the phonons initially in their ground state . in this case",
    "the function @xmath300 in eq.([f1xt ] ) can be expanded in a power series in @xmath301      recursion relations to determine the coefficients @xmath303 are discussed below .",
    "if we take @xmath304 , i.e.  the initial momentum of the particle to be @xmath305 , the integration in eq.([nk1tres ] ) can be trivially performed and yields for @xmath306                    using @xmath318 yields the momentum distribution for the simplest case . already relaxing the assumption @xmath269 leads to a new aspect as @xmath319",
    "can now be written as a product of a power series in @xmath320 and a power series in @xmath321 . multiplying these series and performing the integration as in eq.([nk1exp ] )",
    "leads to an expression for @xmath322 which involves a summation over a product of the expansion coefficients @xcite .    in order to calculate the momentum distribution for finite systems and @xmath123 we also express the functions @xmath323 as laurent series in @xmath320 .",
    "as @xmath121 is a sum over products of these functions it also can be obtained as laurent series in @xmath320 such that the final integration in eq.([nktres ] ) can be performed trivially .      in this appendix",
    "we discuss the influence of the pauli principle on the weight of the first gain satellite in the framework of time - dependent perturbation theory .",
    "this provides additional insight in the meaning of the result to order @xmath247 ( eq.([nktp2 ] ) ) which we obtained from the exact solution eq.([nktres ] ) and eqs.([gkxtp ] ) and ( [ gxtp ] ) . in order to shorten the calculation and to simplify the argument we use the coupling function @xmath138 which vanishes for negative @xmath127 in this appendix and assume the phonons to be initially in their groundstate @xmath324 . as we assume initial statistical operators corresponding to homogeneous systems , it is sufficient to describe the time evolution of an initial state @xmath88 for @xmath2 fermions and a product state for distinguishable particles . in the following we treat fermions and note the simplifications for distinguishable particles in the end .",
    "we calculate @xmath325 as      where @xmath327 with @xmath328 the time evolution operator in the interaction representation defined in eq.([at ] ) . as we are interested in the _ gain region _",
    "we assume that @xmath248 is _ larger _ than the largest initial momentum @xmath329 . for the coupling function @xmath138",
    "the first order perturbation theory for @xmath328 gives no contribution , i.e.  the leading term is of second order in @xmath193      here we have used eq.([rhot ] ) and the fact that the term involving @xmath331 does not contribute for @xmath332 .",
    "the function @xmath263 defined in eq.([gam ] ) results from the double time integration . using eq.([rho ] ) or",
    "the representation of @xmath47 in second quantization one obtains      where the initial momenta not written out are unshifted .",
    "note that the states on the rhs can vanish if one ( or both ) of the shifted momenta coincide with the unshifted ones .",
    "this is the `` trivial '' manifestation of the pauli blocking .",
    "a more subtle effect of the antisymmetry of the states occurs , if we perform the @xmath127-summation in eq.([phikt2 ] ) .",
    "this yields      for fermions the second term on the rhs equals the first one apart from a minus sign , while for distinguishable particles ( without the subscript `` a '' ) they are orthogonal . using eq.([nktac ] ) we obtain for the fermionic occupation numbers in the gain regime      where the prime indicates that the pair @xmath257 only contributes if @xmath258 is different from all the other initial momenta @xmath244 for @xmath336 different from @xmath25 and @xmath228 . for @xmath337 larger than the range @xmath338 the prime on the sum",
    "can be omitted .",
    "for distinguishable particles one obtains from eq.([phiktr ] )        for a more quantitative discussion of the difference between the gain peaks from eqs.([nktgainacp ] ) and ( [ nktgainac ] ) it is necessary to discuss the momentum dependence of @xmath263 for different @xmath340 .",
    "the real part of @xmath263 which is equal to @xmath341 has a peak at @xmath222 , is symmetric to this momentum and apart from weak oscillations falls off like @xmath342 .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath263 is antisymmetric with respect to @xmath222 , with peaks near @xmath222 and falls off like @xmath343 .",
    "the width of the peaks in the real- and imaginary part of @xmath263 is inversely proportional to @xmath200 and this leads to the cancellation in eq.([nktgainacp ] ) .",
