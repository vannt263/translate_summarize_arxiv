    "the problem of strong entanglement in spin systems is very important in view of development of quantum computation . it is acknowledged that the quantum correlations are needed in order to organize the coherent manipulations by different bits in quantum circuit",
    "this is a basic resource of quantum computation providing advantages of quantum circuits in comparison with their classical counterparts @xcite . in particular ,",
    "quantum correlations are responsible for the speedup of quantum algorithms .",
    "it is hard to create large strongly entangled systems . on the contrary , a few - qubit quantum registers",
    "have been constructed using different physical basis .",
    "for instance , there are registers using systems of coupled trapped ions @xcite , registers using superconducting charge qubits @xcite and neutral atom quantum registers @xcite .",
    "these small registers can be organized in large scale quantum circuits @xcite .",
    "review of different measures of both bipartite and multipartite entanglements is given , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "especially one has to mention the wootters criterion which is well elaborated for calculation of entanglement among two nodes in a spin-1/2 system @xcite .",
    "the entanglement between two subsystems consisting of more then one node may be effectively described by the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion @xcite introducing so - called double negativity as a measure of entanglement .",
    "this measure is applicable to both pure and mixed states .",
    "an important concept is so - called entanglement of formation @xcite describing the entanglement between two subsystems in a mixed state .",
    "this paper is devoted to the problem of multipartite entanglement . whereas the bipartite entanglement is studied in many details , the multipartite entanglement is more cumbersome @xcite and it has not been completely understood yet .",
    "of course , considering the problem of strong multipartite entanglement in a quantum system , it would be reasonable to construct such strongly entangled system , where any two nodes are strongly entangled simultaneously .",
    "however , this requirement seems to be too tough .",
    "therefore we assume that the strong node - to - node entanglement between any two nodes is not necessary in order to entangle all nodes in the quantum system . instead of this",
    ", we state that the system becomes strongly entangled at some time moment @xmath1 if any its subsystem is strongly entangled with the rest of the system at this time moment .     we suggest a method to pick out such quantum systems which may not be decomposed into two weakly entangled subsystems .",
    "it is shown that such systems may be simply realized using spin chains .",
    "entanglement considered here is some kind of `` collective '' entanglement because not all node - to - node entanglements in such systems are big .",
    "we assume that such `` collective '' entanglement may provide advantages of quantum devices in comparison with they classical counterparts .",
    "following the above two paragraphs , we introduce so - called minimal entanglement of bipartite decompositions ( mebd ) of the quantum system as a witness of strong entanglement , or as the measure of the above mentioned `` collective '' entanglement",
    ". the basic feature of mebd is that its measure vanishes if only there is at least one possibility to decompose the given quantum system into two weakly entangled subsystems .",
    "thus , mebd helps us to test , for instance , whether the given quantum system may be a candidate for a large volume quantum register , where such decomposition is undesirable since one has to be able to address to all qbits of register at ones with a single operation .",
    "namely this property of quantum register is responsible for the exponential speedup of quantum algorithms in comparison with their classical counterparts . in other words ,",
    "if mebd vanishes , then the system must be considered as two ( or even more ) weakly entangled subsystems rather then a single entangled quantum system .",
    "emphasize that big mebd does not require significant entanglement between any two particular nodes simultaneously . instead of this",
    ", a big mebd means that the whole quantum system is entangled and there is no decomposition of this system into two un - entangled subsystems .",
    "we consider the dynamics of mebd in homogeneous spin-1/2 chains governed by the @xmath0 hamiltonian in the strong external magnetic field .",
    "it will be demonstrated that big mebd is achievable during the relatively short time interval ( comparable with the end - to - end state transfer time interval @xmath2 along the properly adjusted inhomogeneous spin-1/2 chain , @xmath3 @xcite ) and this time interval is slightly increasing with the length of the spin chain .",
    "it is also remarkable that big mebd is achievable in relatively simple models such as the homogeneous spin-1/2 chains with special initial conditions .",
    "these special initial conditions are represented by the certain number of the initially excited spins , i.e. by the number of spins which are directed opposite to the external magnetic field initially . due to these initial conditions",
    "we are not forced to use either the inhomogeneous chains @xcite or inhomogeneous magnetic field @xcite to obtain big mebd , unlike the node - to - node entanglement in the spin chains with the single excited node which has been considered , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the definition of mebd is introduced in sec.[section : def ] .",
    "an algorithm allowing one to obtain a lower estimations of mebd is given in sec.[section : low ] .",
    "this lower estimation becomes important for large systems , where the calculation of mebd following its definition is very complicated .",
    "examples of big mebd in homogeneous spin-1/2 chains governed by the @xmath0 hamiltonian in the strong external magnetic field are represented in sec.[section : hdz ] .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the short spin chains because even multipartite entanglement in the short chains is not a simple phenomenon .",
    "for instance , it is impossible to organize the strong entanglement between any two nodes in the three node spin-1/2 chain simultaneously , while big mebd is achievable in three - node and larger spin chains .",
    "basic results and conclusions are summarized in sec.[section : conclusions ] .",
    "hereafter we will characterize the entanglement between two subsystems @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the @xmath6-node quantum system @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) in terms of the double negativity @xmath9 ( ppt criterion @xcite ) , where @xmath10 is the absolute value of the double sum of the negative eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) which is the transposition of the density matrix @xmath13 ( associated with the system @xmath14 ) with respect to the subsystem @xmath4 ( or @xmath5 ) .",
    "more general , we will also use the bipartite double negativity @xmath15 in the @xmath16-partite system @xmath14 , @xmath17 in this case @xmath18 is the absolute value of the double sum of the negative eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) . here",
    "@xmath21 is the density matrix @xmath13 reduced with respect to all subsystems @xmath22 except @xmath23 and @xmath24 : @xmath25 and superscript @xmath26 ( or @xmath27 ) means the transposition with respect to the subsystem @xmath24 ( or @xmath23 ) .",
    "the choice of ppt criterion provides applicability of the represented algorithm to both pure and mixed states .",
    "the results of this paper are based on the following definition .    *",
    "definition : * let us consider the set of bipartite entanglements of all possible bipartite decompositions of the given quantum system .",
    "the minimal entanglement out of this set will be referred to as the minimal entanglement of bipartite decompositions ( mebd ) of the given quantum system .    in accordance with this definition",
    ", the big value of mebd means that the quantum system may not be decomposed into two weakly entangled subsystems .    to clarify the importance of mebd we refer to the quantum register .",
    "remember , that the inherent property of quantum register is the simultaneous entanglement among all its nodes .",
    "this entanglement allows one to reach the exponential speedup of the quantum calculations in comparison with the classical ones .",
    "thus , if the @xmath6-node quantum system may be separated into two weakly entangled subsystems of @xmath28 and @xmath29 nodes ( @xmath30 ) , then the effective volume of the register constructed on the basis of this quatum system is either @xmath28 or @xmath29 rather then @xmath6 . by definition of mebd",
    "we see that such separation is impossible if only mebd is big .",
    "thus , mebd helps us , for instance , to test whether all nodes of the quantum system may be effectively used as different bits in a quantum register .    in accordance with the above definition of mebd",
    ", we introduce a measure of mebd which vanishes if only there is at least one decomposition of the quantum system into two weakly entangled subsystems ( note that the measure of multipartite entanglement introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite does not have this property ) .",
    "namely , let the system @xmath14 have @xmath31 different decompositions into two subsystems : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are binomial coefficients : @xmath34 .",
    "then we introduce the measure of mebd @xmath35 by the following formula : @xmath36 this formula is consistent with the definition of mebd , because the measure is zero if only there are at least two un - entangled subsystems @xmath37 and @xmath38 : @xmath39 .",
    "we consider that the value of mebd is big if its measure approaches unity , and the value of mebd is small if its measure tends to zero .",
    "emphasize that the big mebd does not require the strong entanglement between any two nodes of the quantum system .",
    "in other words , mebd may be big even if some particular nodes are weakly entangled between each other .",
    "this statement may be simply justified using the property of the hierarchy of double negativities @xcite , which can be formulated as follows .",
    "let the quantum system be separated into the set of subsystems ( [ multipartite ] ) .",
    "then @xmath40 let us apply this property to two simple examples of spin-1/2 systems with big mebd where only some two - node double negativities are big .",
    "hereafter we will use notation @xmath41 for the @xmath6-node spin system , where @xmath42 means the @xmath43th node .",
    "first of all , we turn to the three - node spin system @xmath44 , which may be decomposed as follows : @xmath45 in order to obtain big mebd defined by eq.([sab ] ) it is enough to have two big double negativities : @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , using the property of the hierarchy of double negativities ( [ hdn ] ) we obtain that @xmath48 , @xmath49 . thus , all @xmath50 are big ( all @xmath43 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are different ) and the system may not be decomposed into two weakly entangled subsystems , i.e. mebd of the system",
    "@xmath53 is big .",
    "the second example regards the four node system @xmath54 , which may be decomposed into two subsystems as follows : @xmath55 in order to achieve big mebd , it is enough to have three big double negativities : @xmath46 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "then , using the property of the hierarchy of double negativities ( [ hdn ] ) , one can show that the double negativities for all decompositions ( [ ex_dec ] ) are big .",
    "in fact : @xmath58 in result , since @xmath46 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 are big by our assumption , then the above system @xmath59 may not be decomposed into two weakly entangled subsystems , i.e. mebd of the system @xmath59 is big .",
    "note that @xmath60 given by formula ( [ sab_n ] ) is cumbersome for calculations if @xmath6 is big , because @xmath31 increases very quickly with the increase in @xmath6 .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to introduce another quantity giving a lower estimation of mebd in the system @xmath14 , which is based on the following remark .",
    "let us fix some decomposition of @xmath14 , say , @xmath61 .",
    "let @xmath62 , @xmath63 , be measures of mebd of subsystems @xmath64 ( introduced in the previous decomposition ) , see eq.([sab ] ) with replacement @xmath14 by @xmath64 .",
    "then we state that if the quantity @xmath65 , @xmath66 , is big , then mebd of @xmath14 is big , i.e. @xmath35 is big as well .",
    "the opposite is not true in general , i.e. if @xmath65 is small , then mebd of the system may be big .",
    "this happens if there is another decomposition @xmath67 such that @xmath68 is big .",
    "in other words we may estimate mebd of the system of @xmath6 nodes as follows .",
    "let us fix the @xmath51th decomposition of @xmath14 into two subsystems , @xmath69 , and consider the following quantities : @xmath70 where @xmath71 are measures of mebd of subsystems @xmath72 .",
    "the manifold of all possible @xmath73 will be referred to as @xmath74 : @xmath75 .",
    "it is clear that the value @xmath76 , calculated by the formula @xmath77 satisfies the inequality @xmath78 due to the hierarchy of double negativities ( [ hdn ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath79 may be referred to as the lower estimation of mebd of the system @xmath14 .",
    "we may introduce another lower estimation as follows .",
    "let us decompose each subsystem @xmath80 and @xmath81 into two smaller ones : @xmath82 here @xmath83 , @xmath84 , are the numbers of all possible decompositions ( [ dec21 ] ) and ( [ dec22 ] ) respectively with fixed @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath85 be lower estimation of measure of mebd for the subsystem @xmath86 , see eq.([eij ] ) for the definition of this estimation .",
    "then another lower estimation may be introduced by the following formula : @xmath87 the manifold of all possible @xmath88 will be referred to as @xmath89 : @xmath90 .",
    "we define the quantity @xmath91 , @xmath92 again one has @xmath93 due to the hierarchy of double negativities ( [ hdn ] ) .",
    "thus , the quantity @xmath94 is another lower estimation of mebd of the system @xmath95 .",
    "this process may be continued involving further decompositions of the subsystems @xmath96 into the smaller ones to find the manifolds @xmath97 and appropriate minima @xmath98 , @xmath99 , where @xmath100 corresponds to the case when all subsystems consist of two nodes .",
    "again we obtain that @xmath101 due to the hierarchy of double negativities ( [ hdn ] ) .",
    "all in all , if there is a big element @xmath102 , then we may write @xmath103 , i.e. @xmath104 may serve as the lower estimation of mebd of our system . this low estimation will be found in examples of sec.[section : hdz ] . it is worthwhile to clarify , whether the values @xmath105 can be used for the reasonable approximation of @xmath35 or their are just lower bounds of mebd .",
    "first of all , it is necessary to remark that @xmath105 is significantly less then @xmath35 , which is a consequence of the additivity property of the entanglement @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "this additivity property allows us to improve estimation as follows . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case @xmath106 and symmetrical decomposition @xmath107 .",
    "of course we may not apply the additivity property to our case directly because , for instance , @xmath108 .",
    "nevertheless we use it for the rough estimations .",
    "assume that @xmath109 , which is reasonable for the big mebd when @xmath110",
    ". then @xmath111 .",
    "in accordance with the additivity property we may write @xmath112 consequently we may propose that @xmath113 ( and @xmath114 ) is big if @xmath115 . in this case @xmath116 .",
    "thus @xmath113 may be used to approximate @xmath35 .",
    "the dynamics of entanglement significantly depends on the physical scenario , in particular , on the initial state of the quantum system .",
    "for instance , the dissipative dinamics of multipartite entanglement is considered in set of papers , see @xcite . in this section",
    "we consider the quasiperiodic dynamics of mebd caused by the special initial condition in the spin-1/2 homogeneous chain governed by the @xmath0 hamiltonian @xmath117 in the strong external magnetic field . here",
    "@xmath118 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath119 are distances between the @xmath43th and the @xmath51th nodes , @xmath120 is the planck constant .",
    "hamiltonian @xmath0 is the secular part of the hamiltonian describing the dipole - dipole interaction in the strong external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this hamiltonian is known to commute with @xmath121 ( the @xmath122-projection of the total spin ) .",
    "the density matrix , obtained as the solution to the liouville evolution equation @xmath123 $ ] ( @xmath124 ) , reads @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the initial density matrix . in the homogeneous chain @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "hereafter we use the dimensionless time @xmath129 .",
    "it is pointed above , that the dynamics of entanglement ( and , consequently , the dynamics of mebd ) strongly depends on the initial state of the spin chain , in particular , on the number of initially exited spins ( i.e. the spins which are directed opposite to the external magnetic fields ) .",
    "we use notation @xmath130 for the initial wave function , so that @xmath131 .",
    "we have found that in order to achieve big mebd at some time moment in the homogeneous spin chains with @xmath132 one has to take the initial condition @xmath130 with one , two , three and four exited spins respectively .",
    "we consider that mebd is big at some time moment @xmath133 if the introduced measure @xmath35 ( see eq.([sab ] ) ) approaches unity at this time moment .",
    "emphasize , that the problem of the strong simultaneous entanglement between any two nodes is not resolved even for the spin chains of several nodes .",
    "for this reason the observation of big mebd in the short chains is valuable .",
    "it is found that a big mebd may be achieved even though the entanglement between two particular nodes is weak . in all examples given below , @xmath133 , @xmath132 , means the time moment when big mebd is achieved for the first time in the homogeneous @xmath6-node spin chain .",
    "hereafter we do not write @xmath2 as argument of functions for the sake of simplicity .",
    "we use the dirac notations @xmath134 for the wave functions , where @xmath135 if the @xmath43th spin is directed along the external magnetic field , or @xmath136 if the @xmath43th spin is directed opposite to the external magnetic field , i.e. the @xmath43th spin is excited .",
    "* example 1 : @xmath137 . * [ section : n3 ] as a simple example we consider the chain of three spins , @xmath53 , with the initial state @xmath138 .",
    "all possible decompositions of @xmath53 into two subsystems are given in eq.([decn_3 ] ) .",
