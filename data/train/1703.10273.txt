    "the giant planets in the solar system are natural laboratories for rotating convection and magnetohydrodynamics . the existence of deep convection inside all four giant planets are guaranteed by the measured large intrinsic heat flux ( `` large '' here means larger than the heat flux that can be conducted along the adiabats ) and the large - scale intrinsic magnetic fields .",
    "the dynamical details of the deep convection ( e.g. amplitude , structure , and energy partitioning ) and the coupling to the shallow atmospheric dynamics , however , remain largely unknown . in terms of observations , the gravity and magnetic field measurements from the juno mission @xcite and the cassini grand finale @xcite will provide an unprecedented opportunity to constrain the interior dynamics of jupiter and saturn .",
    "dynamics in the atmospheres of the solar system giant planets have been inferred from cloud tracking @xcite .",
    "the dominant features of the atmospheric dynamics of all four giant planets are the east - west zonal winds on the order of 100 @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) . in the equatorial region ,",
    "jupiter and saturn feature super - rotation ( eastward wind in the corotation frame ) , while uranus and neptune feature sub - rotation ( westward wind in the corotation frame ) .",
    "jupiter s off - equatorial region features zonal winds with alternating directions , with the eastward flows being stronger than the westward flows when viewed in the system iii corotation frame .",
    "saturn s off - equatorial region features zonal flows with varying speeds .",
    "the few minutes uncertainties in our understanding of saturn s deep interior rotation rate translate into uncertainties in the direction of the off - equatorial winds as well as the width of the equatorial super - rotation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the off - equatorial region of uranus and neptune feature one broad sub - rotation in each hemisphere .",
    "the latitude of transition from sub - rotation to super - rotation on the surfaces of uranus and neptune are affected by the uncertainties in our understanding of the deep interior rotation rates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "intrinsic magnetic fields have been detected for all four giant planets @xcite . in terms of amplitude ,",
    "the surface magnetic fields of saturn , uranus and neptune are about 0.3 @xmath1 ( 30,000 @xmath4 ) , while the surface magnetic field of jupiter is about 6 @xmath1 ( 600,000 @xmath4 ) . in terms of morphology , the magnetic fields of jupiter and saturn are axial dipole dominant , while the magnetic fields of uranus and neptune are non - axial and multipolar .",
    "jupiter s magnetic dipole axis is tilted about 10 degrees from the spin axis , while saturn s magnetic dipole axis is aligned with the spin - axis to within 0.06 degrees according to the latest cassini measurements @xcite .    electrical conductivity inside jupiter and saturn increases rapidly yet smoothly from @xmath5 @xmath6 near the 1 bar level to @xmath7 @xmath6 near the @xmath8 mbar level @xcite .",
    "the high electrical conductivity in the deep interior is likely due to pressure ionization of hydrogen .",
    "the alkali metals with solar composition would be the main contributor to the electrical conductivity in the low pressure region .",
    "electrical conductivity inside uranus and neptune is uncertain due to two unknowns : the abundance of ice ( water , methane , ammonia ) in the hydrogen - helium envelope and the abundance of hydrogen in the ice layer .",
    "the electrical conductivity inside ice giant would only reach @xmath9 @xmath6 in the ice layer without significant mixing of hydrogen @xcite , and would remain below @xmath10 @xmath6 in the hydrogen - helium envelope if the ice mixing ratio in the envelope is below 10% @xcite .",
    "the highly conducting region of giant planets with electrical conductivity greater than 1000 @xmath6 likely feature zonal flows on the order of 1 @xmath11 or less , based on jovian magnetic secular variation measurements @xcite .",
    "the magnetic secular variation measurements are not straightforward to interpret for giant planets for two reasons .",
    "first , the rotation rate of the deep interior of giant planets is defined by the observed rotation rate of non - axisymmetric magnetic fields .",
    "thus only the spatial variation of the drifts in the non - axisymmetric magnetic fields ( e.g. , caused by spatial variation of steady deep zonal flow ) and the time variations of the drifts ( e.g. , caused by the time variations of deep zonal flow ) can be straightfowardly detected .",
    "second , the forward problem of observable magnetic secular variations for a given deep flow structure has not been solved for a planet with radially varying electrical conductivity .",
    "we will address the second problem in detail in a separate paper .",
    "for now , we interpret the inferred jovian magnetic secular variation loosely as representing flows in regions with magnetic reynolds number @xmath12 greater than 10 .",
    "we choose @xmath13 as the threshold to ensure the frozen - in condition is satisfied .",
    "this interpretation indicates that deep zonal flows inside jupiter with magnetic reynolds number greater than 10 should be on the order of 1 @xmath11 or less .",
    "the case for saturn is less clear .",
    "neither any departure from axisymmetric nor any secular variation in the axisymmetric magnetic field has been detected @xcite , which indicates the possibility of stronger zonal flows in the highly conducting region of saturn .",
    "in fact , a relatively strong zonal - dominant flow in the outer part of the highly conducting region of saturn could be a natural explanation for the extreme axisymmetry of the observed intrinsic magnetic field @xcite . a stable compositional gradient ( e.g. set up by helium rain out from hydrogen in the mbar region ) could help ensure the dominance of zonal flows in the outer part of the highly conducting region of saturn @xcite .",
    "the observed intrinsic heat flow of giant planets set an upper bound on the internal ohmic dissipation , when viewed on long time scales .",
    "the calculation of ohmic dissipation is robust and straightforward for regions with low magnetic reynolds number ( e.g. @xmath14 ) , since the magnetic field there can still be robustly estimated from potential field continuation .",
    "the ohmic dissipation constraint excludes 100 @xmath0 zonal winds in regions with electrical conductivity higher than 0.01 @xmath6 for jupiter and saturn @xcite . however , zonal winds on the order of @xmath10 @xmath0 could well reside in the semiconducting region of giant planets .",
    "detection of zonal winds on the order of 1 @xmath0 in the semiconducting region of giant planets would indicate a relatively smooth transition of zonal flows from surface to the deep interior . strictly speaking",
    ", the internal ohmic dissipation can exceed the observed surface luminosity by a factor of @xmath15 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are the temperatures in the deep interior and temperature near the surface of the convective envelope respectively .",
    "this ratio is around 40 for jupiter when considering dissipation outside 0.90 @xmath18 .",
    "however , given the super exponential increase of the electrical conductivity as a function of depth inside jupiter and saturn , a factor of 40 makes little difference in terms of constraining the depth of deep zonal flows from ohmic dissipation considerations @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations with strong radial variation of electrical conductivity and density have been carried out @xcite .",
    "limited by the currently available computational power , relatively high viscosity needs to be adopted in these simulations .",
    "a common finding from these simulations is that dipole - dominant magnetic field and strong deep zonal flows are incompatible .",
    "a single band of equatorial super - rotation confined in the low electrical conductivity region are the most common features in the solutions with a dipole - dominant magnetic field . given the difficulty of obtaining off - equatorial zonal jet in the currently accessible parameter space of deep shell numerical mhd simulations , the interaction between off - equatorial jet and deep dynamo generated magnetic field likely needs to be addressed in reduced models .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the inevitable interaction between zonal flows and magnetic fields in the semi - conducting region of giant planets .",
    "in particular , we will show that such interactions , in the background of rotating turbulent convection , will generate detectable poloidal magnetic field perturbations . in section 2",
    ", we present a qualitative description of the physics of zonal flow magnetic field interactions in the semi - conducting region of giant planets .",
    "the equation of mean - field electrodynamics and its simplification under the small poloidal perturbation limit are presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 and 5 present our analyses and calculations for jupiter and saturn , followed by discussion and summary in section 6 and 7 respectively .",
    "two physical features uniquely define the physics of zonal flow magnetic field interaction in the semi - conducting region of giant planets .",
    "the first is the rapidly yet smoothly radial - varying electrical conductivity , and the second is the presence of a deep dynamo ( figs . [",
    "fig : fig2 ] & [ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "smoothly radial - varying electrical conductivity indicates a smooth transition from hydrodynamics to magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) inside jupiter and saturn .",
    "the electric current and lorentz force would increase smoothly as a function of depth .",
    "the presence of a deep dynamo imposes a large - scale magnetic field in the semi - conducting region .",
    "this background large - scale magnetic field is anchored to the @xmath19 @xmath11 flow in the deep dynamo region .",
    "zonal flow , meridional circulation , and turbulent convection in the semi - conducting region will modify the background magnetic field via shear , advection , stretch and twist .",
    "the lorentz force associated with these actions will back - act on the flows .",
    "the back - action of lorentz force likely enters the dynamical balance of flows inside giant planets .",
    "however , the role of lorentz force on planetary interior flows is still poorly understood .",
    "-effect ) , and the generation of poloidal magnetic perturbations by the small - scale turbulent convection acting on the toroidal magnetic field ( the dynamo @xmath2-effect ) .",
    "both the toroidal and the poloidal magnetic field resulted from this interaction would be spatially correlated with the deep zonal flows . due to the relatively low electrical conductivity in the semi - conducting region ,",
    "spatially separated @xmath20effect and @xmath21effect can communicate effectively through magnetic diffusion .",
    "toroidal magnetic field generated by zonal flows at relatively shallow depth can diffuse downward to deeper regions where the @xmath21effect is more efficient ( panel c).,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    at present , we restrict our attention to the kinematic problem : the modification of the dynamo generated magnetic field by zonal flows in the semi - conducting region .",
    "the full dynamical problem is yet to be solved .",
    "here we qualitatively describe the physics of the kinematic interaction .",
    "the mathematical details will be given in the next section .",
    "the interaction consists of two ingredients ( fig .",
    "2 ) : the generation of toroidal magnetic field by the zonal flows acting on the background poloidal magnetic field ( the dynamo @xmath22-effect ) , and the generation of poloidal magnetic perturbations by the small - scale turbulent convection acting on the toroidal magnetic field ( the dynamo @xmath2-effect ) .",
    "both the toroidal and the poloidal magnetic fields resulted from this interaction would be spatially correlated with the deep zonal flows .",
    "the interaction between flow and magnetic field in the semi - conducting region is distinct from that in the deep dynamo region in several ways .",
    "first of all , a crucial distinction between the two concerns the validity of our current analytical tools to deal with the problem .",
    "the first order smoothing approximation ( fosa ) in the derivation of the dynamo @xmath21effect is strictly valid in the semi - conducting region where the magnetic reynolds number associated with small - scale flow is small .",
    "the validity of the dynamo @xmath21effect in describing the magnetic field generation process in the deep dynamo region , where rm associated with small - scale flow is large , has been seriously challenged @xcite .",
    "second , due to the relatively low electrical conductivity in the semi - conducting region , magnetic diffusion is more pronounced . as a result ,",
    "spatially separated @xmath20effect and @xmath21effect can communicate effectively through magnetic diffusion ( fig .",
    "the electrical conductivity gradient dictates an asymmetric magnetic diffusion : downward diffusion will be more pronounced than upward diffusion due to higher electrical conductivity deep down .",
    "toroidal magnetic field generated by zonal flows at relatively shallow depth can diffuse downward to deeper regions where the @xmath21effect is more efficient .",
    "thus the poloidal field generated by the interaction will likely exceed the estimations from local approximations .",
    "third , the interaction is only expected to produce a small modification to the pre - existing magnetic field originated from the deep dynamo region .",
    "energetic consideration strongly favors the wind induced poloidal magnetic field in the semi - conducting region being small compared to the deep dynamo generated magnetic field .",
    "compare to the semi - conducting region , it is several orders of magnitude more efficient to drive the same amount of electric current in the deep dynamo region due to the several orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity .",
    "moreover , if the poloidal field generated by the interaction in the semi - conducting region are comparable to the deep dynamo generated field , the magnetic field is expected to become oscillatory as shown in the classical work of @xmath23 dynamo by @xcite and fully dynamical mhd simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". given the extremely tight upper bound on the time variation of the dipole moment of jupiter and saturn @xcite , an oscillatory magnetic field with a period on the order of @xmath24 100 @xmath25 or shorter can be safely ruled out .",
    "these considerations indicate that the poloidal magnetic field generated by the flows in the semi - conducting region likely is a small perturbation to the deep dynamo generated poloidal magnetic field .",
    "this realization would enable us to simplify the dynamo equations in the semi - conducting region considerably .",
    "to quantitatively describe zonal flow magnetic field interaction in the semi - conducting region of giant planet , we turn to mean - field electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the essential step in the development of mean - field electrodynamics is the closure of the mean - field equation : the time evolution of the mean magnetic field depends only explicitly on the mean flow and the mean magnetic field , while the interaction between the small - scale flow and the small - scale magnetic field can be effectively described by the dynamo @xmath21effect .",
    "this closure is not guaranteed in general . under the condition where the magnetic reynolds number associated with the small - scale flow ( @xmath26 )",
    "is smaller than unity , this closure can be achieved . under this condition ,",
    "the small - scale magnetic fields owe their existence entirely to the small - scale flow acting on the mean magnetic field .",
    "as one moves from the deep interior towards the outer part of the giant planets with relatively low electrical conductivity , there will be a cut - off radius beyond which @xmath26 is smaller than unity .",
    "this cut - off radius sets the lower boundary for the semi - conducting region of giant planets , which ensures the validity of mean - field electrodynamics in this part of the giant planets .",
    "any attempt to apply mean - field electrodynamics to the deep dynamo region of giant planets should be cautioned . after a brief introduction of the mean - field electrodynamics equation",
    ", we derive the simplification of it under the small poloidal perturbation limit .      in mean - field electrodynamics ( moffatt , 1978 ; krause & radler , 1980 ) , the governing equation for the mean magnetic field @xmath27 reads @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the effective magnetic diffusivity @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the magnetic diffusivity ( @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the magnetic permeability of free - space and @xmath34 is the electrical conductivity ) , @xmath2 is the dynamo @xmath21effect , and @xmath35 is the turbulent diffusivity , and they can be estimated as @xmath36 @xmath37 under fosa where @xmath38 is the typical length scale of the turbulent convective cells , @xmath39 is a coefficient measuring the relative kinetic helicity of the flow @xmath40 it should be noted that @xmath2 takes the unit of velocity and @xmath35 takes the unit of diffusivity . from here",
    "on , we work with the mean - fields only and drop the over - line in the symbols for simplicity .      as discussed in section 2 ,",
    "the following conditions are likely true for zonal flow magnetic field interaction in the semi - conducting region of giant planets .",
    "1 ) the dominant axial dipole components observed at jupiter and saturn originate from the deep dynamo region .",
    "2 ) the poloidal magnetic field resulted from the interaction among zonal flow , turbulent convective flow , and the background dipolar magnetic field in the semi - conducting region is small compared to the background magnetic field .",
    "3 ) the toroidal magnetic field resulted from the interactions , on the other hand , needs not to be small compared to the background magnetic field .    under these conditions , the mean - field equation under axisymmetric decomposition @xmath41",
    "gets simplified to @xmath42 @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the background planetary dipolar magnetic field , @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the meridional circulation , and @xmath22 is the angular velocity @xmath47 .",
    "the above two equations are partially decoupled : the poloidal potential @xmath48 depends on the toroidal magnetic field @xmath49 , however , @xmath49 is independent of @xmath48 .    it can be shown that the magnetic reynolds number of the meridional circulation is much smaller than unity in the semi - conducting region ( see appendix d ) .",
    "thus , the meridional circulation can be ignored as a first step , the mean - field equations get further simplified to @xmath50 @xmath51 the steady - state solution to the above two equations are then sought through spectral decompositions . the spectral representation of the above equations and some details of the numerics are given in appendix a.    the steady - state solution to partially decoupled mean - field equations ( [ eqn : a_final ] - [ eqn : b_final ] ) are further compared with time - stepping of the fully coupled mean - field equations ( [ eqn : a_f2 ] - [ eqn : b_f2 ] in appendix b ) .",
    "the steady - state solution and the time - stepping solution agree to within 5% when the wind - induced poloidal perturbations are smaller than 20% of the background field ( see appendix b ) .",
    "the simplicity of the steady - state solution , and the simple physical picture underlying it , makes it the preferred way to obtain solution for this problem .",

    "more importantly , mean - field electrodynamics becomes questionable in regions with electrical conductivity much greater than 1000 @xmath6 due to the large @xmath56 associated with the small - scale convection .",
    "assuming a convective velocity on the order of 1 @xmath3 , and a convective length - scale on the order of @xmath57 of the planetary radius @xcite , the magnetic reynolds number associated with small - scale convection would exceed unity for regions with electrical conductivity greater than 1000 @xmath6 . with the same estimate about the typical velocity and",
    "the typical length - scale of the convection , magnetic diffusivity in regions with electrical conductivity smaller than 1000 @xmath6 would dominate the ( total ) effective diffusivity ( @xmath58 ) . from these estimations ,",
    "the lower boundary of the semi - conducting region of jupiter and saturn can be placed at 0.93 @xmath18 and 0.745 @xmath52 respectively .",

    "the magnetic reynolds number associated with 100 @xmath0 flows are smaller than 0.25 at a depth with @xmath59 and @xmath60 , and are smaller than @xmath61 at a depth with @xmath62 and @xmath60 . setting the outer boundary of the semi - conducting region at 0.98 @xmath18 and 0.90",
    "@xmath52 would suffice for investigating the interaction between zonal flow and magnetic field under most circumstances .",
    "we notice that the radii correspond to 0.01 @xmath6 for jupiter and saturn ( 0.972 @xmath18 and 0.875 @xmath52 ) turn out to be very close to the cylindrical radii at which the equatorial super - rotation maps to the deep interior along cylinders parallel to the spin - axis .",
    "the equatorial super - rotation observed at jupiter and saturn could extend to the deep interior with constant velocity along the spin - axis .",
    "for this particular scenario , high - degree gravity moments will be dominated by the mass redistribution associated with the equatorial super - rotation @xcite .      for a given zonal flow profile , a given electrical conductivity profile , and a given background magnetic field profile ,",
    "the toroidal magnetic field can be uniquely determined from equation ( [ eqn : b_final ] ) without any further assumption or free - parameter . to determine the measurable poloidal magnetic perturbations",
    ", however , one needs to estimate the amplitude and profile of the dynamo @xmath21effect which is a big unknown .",
    "here we make the following assumptions about the dynamo @xmath21effect for jupiter and saturn , based on our understanding of rapidly rotating convection .",
    "1 ) the dynamo @xmath21effect is antisymmetric about the equator .",
    "2 ) in each hemisphere , the statistical properties of the turbulent convection is uniform in the semi - conducting region .",
    "the dynamo @xmath21effect thus is inversely proportional to the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "3 ) the amplitude of the dynamo @xmath21effect at the base of the semi - conducting region is about 10% of the convective velocity . with the estimated convective velocity of 1 @xmath3 , the amplitude of the dynamo @xmath21effect is about 0.1 @xmath3 at the base of the semi - conducting region .",
    "we adopt the following functional form for the dynamo @xmath21effect , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the amplitude of the dynamo @xmath21effect at the base of the semi - conducting region , @xmath65 is the magnetic diffusivity at the base of the semi - conducting region , @xmath66 is the co - latitude , and @xmath67 is the error function .",
    "this functional form ensures @xmath68 in the majority of the northern hemisphere , and @xmath69 in the majority of the southern hemisphere .",
    "it should be noted that the results to be presented do not depend on the details of the functional form .",
    "a dynamo @xmath21effect with a simple sine dependence on latitude and inversely proportional to magnetic diffusivity would yield very similar results .      from equations ( [ eqn : a_final ] ) and ( [ eqn : b_final ] ) , it is straightforward to make an order - of - magnitude analysis of the magnitude of the wind induced magnetic perturbations . it can be shown that @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the amplitude of the background magnetic field , and @xmath74 @xmath75 it is important to realize that the two magnetic reynolds numbers are generally evaluated at different conductivity levels , since diffusion is efficient in the semi - conducting region .",
    "we will compare the results from numerical calculations to these scalings .",
    "we conducted a series of calculations of zonal flow magnetic field interactions for jupiter and saturn .",
    "we solved the spectra representation of equations ( [ eqn : a_final ] ) and ( [ eqn : b_final ] ) using the chebyshev collocation method ( see appendix a ) . the typical resolution adopted in our calculations",
    "are 480 chebyshev grid points in the radial direction and 360 gaussian - quadrature grid points in the latitudinal direction .",
    "only hemispherically symmetric winds are considered for simplicity . for each planet ,",
    "two surface wind profiles are built via mirroring the northern hemisphere wind to the southern hemisphere and vice versa .",
    "these surface wind profiles are first projected onto order-1 associated legendre polynomials , @xmath76 , then truncated at degree 100 to ensure smoothness .",
    "first , we investigate the interaction between a single equatorial zonal jet and the deep dynamo generated magnetic field . for this calculation , we are mostly interested in the case where the equatorial jet closely resembles that observed at the surface of jupiter and saturn .",
    "we project the observed equatorial jet along the direction of spin - axis into the deep interiors of jupiter and saturn , and calculated the magnetic reynolds number associated with these flows in the equatorial plane ( fig .",

    "as the equatorial jet of jupiter is very narrow , the geometrical effect is pronounced .",
    "this geometrical property is well reflected in the dimensionless interaction parameter @xmath79 .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "5 that the peak toroidal field strength is very close to the peak value of the dimensionless interaction parameter .",
    "downward diffusion of the toroidal magnetic field is prominent in these two calculations .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "5 that although the interaction between the zonal flow and the background magnetic field peak strongly near the outer boundary , the toroidal magnetic field generated by the interaction diffuses downward .",
    "this downward diffusion can be most easily understood through visualizing the electric currents .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "6 displays the streamline of the electric current in the meridional plane for the saturn case .",
    "it can be seen that horizontal currents in the interaction region converge into radial currents and penetrate downward into regions with high electric conductivity .",
    "although the electrical currents penetrate into deeper regions , the ohmic dissipation is dominated by the relatively shallow regions since @xmath84 .",
    "thus for relatively constant current density as a function of radial distances , the ohmic dissipation is dominated by regions with low electric conductivity .",
    "the integrated ohmic dissipation are @xmath85 @xmath86 for the jupiter case and @xmath87 @xmath86 for the saturn case , which are many orders of magnitude smaller than the observed heat flux at the surface of jupiter and saturn .",
    "7 shows the wind induced radial magnetic field at 0.985 @xmath18 and 0.95 @xmath52 in these two calculations . the induced radial magnetic field associated with",
    "the observed equatorial super rotation take a dipolar geometry and very small values : @xmath87 and @xmath88 of the background dipole field respectively .",
    "these translate into @xmath24 2 @xmath4 and @xmath24 0.7 @xmath4 for jupiter and saturn respectively , which are extremely unlikely to be detectable .",
    "thus even if the observed surface equatorial super rotation at jupiter and saturn project into the interior of the planets with constant velocity along the direction of the spin - axis , only negligible modifications to the deep dynamo generated magnetic field are expected .",
    "we then proceed to calculate the interaction between the off - equatorial jets and the background magnetic field . for these calculations ,",
    "different zonal flow profiles in the semi - conducting region are defined by three parameters : the transition depth , @xmath89 , peak amplitude at the transition depth , @xmath90 , and vertical wind scale height below the transition depth , @xmath91 .",
    "the cylindrical radial dependence of the zonal flows is simply the surface zonal wind projected along the spin - axis .",
    "zonal flows in the semi - conducting region can be expressed as @xmath92 here @xmath93 is the radial decay function which takes the following functional form @xmath94 @xmath95 , r > r_t\\ ] ] where @xmath96},\\ ] ] @xmath97 and @xmath98 is the radius of the plant .",
    "8 displays a few examples of the radial decay function of the zonal flows in the semi - conduction region .",
    "this radial decay function ensures the smoothness of the zonal flows and allows for larger vertical scale heights outside the transition depth . in all the off - equatorial jets calculations presented here",
    ", we fix the transition depth to 0.972 @xmath18 for the jupiter cases , and to 0.875 @xmath52 for the saturn cases .",
