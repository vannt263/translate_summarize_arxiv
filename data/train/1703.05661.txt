    "semiconductor quantum - well ( qw ) microcavities are 1d photonic crystal structures , specifically designed to control light - matter interactions .",
    "the strong coupling cavity - emitter regime of operation is realised when the qw exciton - cavity photon interaction exceeds any dissipative rates in the system .",
    "the eigenmodes of the system are mixed , entangled light - matter states that can be viewed as photons ` dressed ' with the medium polarisation ( exciton ) ; these give rise to bosonic quasiparticles known as microcavity exciton - polaritons .",
    "owing to their photon component , exciton polaritons are extremely light particles . as a result of their excitonic component ,",
    "however , they exhibit strong repulsive inter - particle interactions , leading to strong nonlinearities nearly four orders of magnitude higher than in typical nonlinear solid - state optical media .",
    "the nonlinearities arise primarily from parametric scattering of exciton - polaritons , driven by a coulomb exchange interaction between polariton - excitonic constituents , with additional , smaller contributions originating from phase space filling @xcite .",

    "these polaritons display collective dynamics consistent with superfluidity . when studying polariton flow around a defect , it has been demonstrated that at high flow velocities , the perturbation induced by the defect gives rise to the turbulent emission of quantised vortices , and to the nucleation of oblique , dark ` quantum hydrodynamic ' solitons @xcite .",
    "accurate tracking in space and time of long - life ( @xmath1 ) polaritons reveals long - range ballistic propagation and coherent flow over macroscopic distances  from hundreds of @xmath2 to millimetres within the cavity @xcite .",
    "it is well known that a high - density and low - temperature gas of microcavity polaritons exhibits effects pertinent to cold - atom bose - einstein condensates @xcite . however , unlike atomic condensates  for which bright solitons exist only for attractive interactions , while repulsive interactions give rise to dark solitons ",
    "bright polariton solitons supported by repulsive exciton - exciton interactions have been theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated @xcite for pump momenta beyond the inflection point of the lower polariton branch , where the polariton effective mass becomes negative .",
    "self - localisation ( in a direction collinear with the pump wave vector ) occurs when the dispersion induced by the negative polariton effective mass compensates the repulsive polariton - polariton interaction .",
    "coherent polariton propagation has also been experimentally demonstrated in laterally confined microcavity wires , fabricated by lateral etching of planar semiconductor microcavities @xcite .",
    "condensed polaritons spread over the whole wire , with the higher - energy excitons remaining at the excitation spot @xcite .",
    "polariton waves can be confined in structures with sub-@xmath3 size .",
    "this opens up possibilities for fabrication of polaritonic integrated circuits based on structured semiconductor microcavities on a chip .",
    "polaritonic structured media are under active development , with arrays of microcavity wires currently being fabricated to act as waveguides for polariton waves . structured microcavities are a particularly promising integration platform due to the large polaritonic nonlinearity , broad transparency window , mature fabrication technology and the possibility of monolithic integration with semiconductor diode lasers and vcsels . in this respect ,",
    "new theories and numerical methods are needed to model the nonlinear polariton dynamics in non - planar waveguides .",
    "we have recently developed a driven - dissipative , scalar ( spinless ) gross - pitaveskii model of the nonlinear polariton dynamics in realistic microcavity wires .",

    "interact among themselves in such a way as to give rise to a self - localisation mechanism that prevents the pulse from broadening .",
    "self - localisation phenomena in multi - mode systems arise due to counter - balancing nonlinearity with a combination of dispersive effects : material ( polariton ) dispersion due to a frequency - dependent dielectric response , cavity modes dispersion , and variation of the group velocity of each mode . in a recent work @xcite , using the coupled - mode expansion technique we showed that a new component of the nonlinearity has to be taken into account ",
    "namely , the intermodal nonlinear coupling .",
    "the latter arises from two distinct nonlinear phenomena : intermodal cross - phase modulation ( through kerr nonlinearity ) and degenerate four - wave mixing ( through polariton parametric scattering ) .    in this work",
    ", we provide more details of our general mean - field , driven - dissipative gross - pitaevskii model .",
    "we apply it to the problem of polariton soliton propagation in microcavity wires with different widths  with a view to designing integrated polaritonic devices . using the model",
    ", we study the soliton existence domain , multistability and group velocity dependence on the wire width , and identify optimum geometry parameters for soliton formation .",
    "we provide a qualitative explanation of the non - monotonic dependence of the maximum soliton amplitude and group velocity dependence on the wire width . additionally , we investigate the dependence of the multistability on the cavity - emitter system s dissipation parameter , which includes exciton reservoir dephasing and cavity photon decay .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate numerically a new coherent propagation phenomenon of a radiating polariton soliton exhibiting periodic collapses and revivals , and identify regimes for existence of this new class of polariton solitons in a realistic microcavity wire .",
    "finally , we simulate polariton soliton propagation in tilted and tapered microcavity wires , and determine the maximum tilt angle for which the soliton persists .",

    "following this line of reasoning , we would expect to encounter another bifurcation just below @xmath138 , where a third loop appears in the multistability curve ( see curve in magenta in fig .",
    "[ fig : soliton_branches_widths ] ( f ) ) .",

    "the driving force behind this fwhm variation is currently unclear ; however , this will be a subject of further investigation using our newly developed coupled - mode expansion technique @xcite .",
    "we have developed a model of the polariton nonlinear dynamics in non - planar microcavity wires , based on driven - dissipative , 2d mean - field gross - pitaevskii coupled equations .    for a realistic microcavity wire structure , we found that the typical for planar microcavities conventional bistability of the nonlinear mode power upon variation of the pump amplitude evolves into complex multistability .",
    "we have discussed the origin of the multistability in detail , and traced it back to the number of modes arising as a result of the interplay of three distinct factors .",
    "firstly , the number of modes supported by the microcavity confinement potential is determined by the potential depth and width .",
    "secondly , the pump frequency detuning from the reference frequency ( blue - shifted with respect to the lower polariton branch resonance frequency for the relevant angle of incidence of the pump ) selects a subset of these modes .",
    "thirdly , depending on its parity , the spatial symmetry of the pump further reduces the number of available modes ; for example , a symmetric , gaussian - shaped pump leads to suppression of the odd modes and survival of the even modes .",
    "further , by employing linear stability analysis and conducting dynamical simulations , we discovered a range of pump amplitudes for which polariton solitons exist in a realistic structure operating in the triggered parametric oscillator regime .",
    "we have confirmed these results using the 2d newton - raphson method .",
    "in contrast to the single - mode polariton solitons in planar microcavities , polariton solitons obtained by our scalar model in microcavity wires exhibit a complex multi - mode structure .",
    "this type of spatially localised polariton solitons deserve special attention , since multi - mode solitons are capable of propagating further along an imperfect microcavity than their single - mode counterparts @xcite . in view of this fact",
    ", we have developed a modal expansion method @xcite to investigate the inter - modal nonlinear interactions and mechanisms of localisation , and attempt to find a means to leverage these multi - mode interactions and polariton dynamics for the development of polaritonic integrated circuits .",
    "bearing in mind recent advances in fabrication of microcavities with ultrahigh polariton lifetimes @xcite , we investigated the possibility of exciting solitons in an environment with lower dissipation ( i.e. , when the exciton and cavity decay rates are lower ) .",
    "for these conditions , we numerically demonstrated an interesting type of radiating polariton soliton exhibiting collapses and revivals during propagation along the microcavity wire .    in order to gauge the plausibility of using microcavity wires for building y - splitters , we examined the effect of tilted microcavity wires on the solitons ability to propagate . using dynamical simulations in tandem with 2d newton - raphson calculations ,",
    "we identified pump amplitude - dependent maximum angles for which the maximum of the soliton amplitude was virtually unaltered ( @xmath161 reduction ) ; the limit appeared to be around @xmath162 .",
    "we also established the critical tilt angles above which the solitons vanished ; the highest such angle was approximately @xmath163 .    with a view to creating novel polaritonic devices , we dynamically studied polariton soliton propagation in a tapered microcavity wire .",
    "we found that , as the polariton soliton travels over certain ranges of microcavity wire width , both its maximum amplitude and group velocity increase .",
    "this microcavity wire geometry could hence be exploited for reshaping and creation of solitons with specific characteristics , or simply to generate soliton amplification .",
    "for instance , tapered wire sections can be used as repeaters on a transmission line , compensating for signal loss at junctions or degradation due to structural imperfections .",
    "furthermore , appropriate tapered sections could be selected according to whether fast or slow polariton solitons are required for a particular device application .",
    "for instance , fast polariton solitons are necessary for ultrafast polariton switches and modulators with applications in quantum information technologies ",
    "e.g. , routing entangled single photons .",
    "conversely , similar to the slow - light effect @xcite , designing geometries supporting slow polariton solitons should lead to an enhancement of the nonlinear response , thereby decreasing the threshold for nonlinear effects , such as polariton parametric scattering and the kerr effect .",
    "these slow polariton solitons may have applications as controllable delay lines and buffers .    in summary",
    ", this work lays the foundations for the simulation of the basic building blocks of future polaritonic integrated circuits , such as x- and y - splitters , couplers and routers , based on soliton logic .",
    "clearly , theoretical studies like these will be of great importance for the physical realisation of low - consumption , low - intensity threshold polariton integrated circuits of the future .",
