    "as witnessed by the heavily cratered surfaces imaged by spacecrafts , the chief geophysical process affecting asteroids is _ impacts_. on rare occasions , the impact of a large projectile can be so energetic that the target asteroid is violently torn apart , and the pieces are thrown into space .",
    "the sites of such cosmic accidents are filled with debris that gravitationally accumulate into larger conglomerates , and drift away at speeds that are roughly commensurate with the escape speed from the original target body ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "initially , all orbits are similar , because @xmath1 , where @xmath2 - 20 km s@xmath3 is the orbital speed of main belt asteroids . on longer timescales ,",
    "however , the orbits are altered by gravitational perturbations from planets , and the orbital elements of individual bodies start to diverge .",
    "it may therefore seem challenging to identify fragments of a catastrophic collision that happened eons ago .",
    "fortunately , starting with the pioneering work of k. hirayama ( hirayama , 1918 ; see also cimrman , 1917 ) , astronomers have developed various methods to deal with this issue ( section 2 ) .",
    "roughly speaking , these methods consist in a transformation that brings the orbital elements at the observed epoch to a standard , called the _ proper elements _ ( kneevi et al . ,",
    "2002 ) , that is unchanging in time ( or , at least , would be unchanging if chaotic dynamics , non - gravitational forces , and other perturbations could be ignored ) . thus , ideally , daughter fragments produced by breakup of a parent asteroid will appear as a group in space of the proper elements even gigayears after the original collision .",
    "these groups are called asteroid families , or _",
    "dynamical _ families to emphasize that they have been identified from dynamical considerations .",
    "telescopic surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) and akari all - sky survey provide a wealth of data on physical properties of the main belt asteroids ( ivezi et al . , 2001 ; mainzer et al . , 2011 ; usui et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "they have been used to cross - link the color and albedo measurements with the lists of dynamical families , in much the same way the spectroscopic and taxonomic data have previously been applied to this purpose ( see cellino et al . , 2002 for a review ) .",
    "this work is useful to physically characterize the asteroid families ( see chapter by masiero et al . in this volume ) , including cases where two or more dynamical families overlap , and identify distant `` halo '' family members that would otherwise be confused with the local background ( e.g. , bro and morbidelli , 2013 ) .",
    "given that the sdss and wise catalogs now contain data for over 100,000 unique asteroids , it has also become practical to conduct search for families in extended space , where the color and/or albedo data are taken into account simultaneously with the orbital elements ( e.g. , parker et al . , 2008 ; masiero et al . , 2013 ;",
    "carruba et al . , 2013a ) .",
    "the physical data can be used to identify _",
    "the problem of interlopers arises because the clustering criterion applied to identify the dynamical families is only a rough expression of the true membership .",
    "unrelated asteroids that just happen to have nearby values of proper elements will be grouped together with the true members , and will thus appear in the lists of dynamical families obtained from the proper elements ( e.g. , migliorini et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "these interlopers , especially the large ones , introduce ambiguity in the interpretation of impact conditions that produced individual families , and in the implications of these studies for asteroid interiors ( cf .",
    "michel et al . , 2003 ;",
    "nesvorn et al .",
    ", 2006a ) .",
    "here we discuss how large interlopers and true largest members in families can be found by applying the `` v - shape '' criterion , which is based on the notion that large fragments are ejected at low speeds , and have less mobility due to the yarkovsky effect ( section 4 ) .",
    "based on the synthesis of asteroid families extracted from recent publications ( moth - diniz et al .",
    ", 2005 ; nesvorn et al . , 2005 ;",

    ", 2013a ; milani et al . ,",
    "2014 ) , we attempt to build a consensus that could serve as a starting point for future studies .",
    "we classify the asteroid families into _ notable _ cases ( those that have a high statistical significance , and are thus real , and/or are notable for other reasons ) and _ candidate _ families ( less interesting cases where the statistical significance is low or can not currently be established ) .",
    "the distinction between notable and candidate families is somewhat arbitrary , and will intentionally be left strictly undefined , because that is the nature of things .",
    "we expect that many candidate families will be confirmed with more data , and that a few notable families may fall into oblivion .",
    "the lists of notable families are being made available at the planetary data system ( pds ) node , and are discussed in section 7 .",
    "a new and exciting development in the past decade was the detection of several asteroid families with very young formation ages .",
    "for example , the karin family was shown to have formed only @xmath4  m.y . ago ( nesvorn et al . , 2002a ) .",
    "these cases are important , because various collisional and dynamical processes had little time to act on these families to alter their properties .",
    "the young families have thus attracted much attention from scientists studying impact physics , space weathering , debris disks , etc .",
    "as we explain in section 3 , the age of a young family can be determined by numerically integrating the orbits of its members backward in time and demonstrating that they converge to each other at some specific time in the past .",
    "this is the time of a breakup , and the family age , @xmath5 , is the time elapsed from the breakup event .",
    "the method of backward integration of orbits only works for the families with @xmath6 m.y .",
    "this is because dynamics of main - belt asteroids on longer timescales is governed by chaos , encounters with ( 1 ) ceres and other large asteroids , and non - gravitational forces .",
    "a complementary statistical method for the estimation of family age has been developed in vokrouhlick et al .",
    "( 2006a , b ) .",
    "the method tracks , in detail , how the family structure in semimajor axis changes over time as the family members drift away by the yarkovsky effect ( section 5 ) .",
    "the semimajor axis spread of an older family will generally be greater than that of a younger family .",
    "a  compilation of formation ages of the asteroid families can be used to constrain how the population of the asteroid belt collisionally evolved over time ( e.g. , bottke et al .",
    ", 2005a , b ; cibulkov et al . , 2014 ) , and how asteroid surfaces age by space weathering ( chapter by brunetto et al . in this volume",
    "here we discuss the standard method to identify asteroid families .",
    "this method consists of the ( 1 ) computation of proper elements , or other elements unchanging with time , for asteroids with well - known orbits , ( 2 ) identification of concentrations or groups of asteroids in proper element space , and ( 3 ) establishing the statistical significance of identified groups .",
    "these steps are discussed in sections 2.1 , 2.2 and 2.3 . in section 2.4",
    ", we examine the `` overlap problem '' where two or more families overlap in proper element space , and need to be separated . for this",
    "it is useful to consider families in _ extended _ space with physical data being included in addition to the proper elements .",
    "the search in extended space can also lead to the identification of new families ( section 2.5 ) .",
    "very young families ( @xmath7 m.y . ) , for which the member orbits have not had time to differentially precess away from each other , can also be identified as groups in space of the _ osculating _ orbital elements ( section  2.6 ) .",
    "* 2.1 proper elements *    the ejection speeds of sizable fragments produced by collisional breakups of main belt asteroids are generally much smaller than their orbital speeds .",
    "the fragments will therefore initially cluster near the original orbit of their parent body , and will appear as such if the subsequent effects of planetary perturbations are removed by projecting orbits into space of proper elements .",
    "the three most useful proper elements are : the proper semimajor axis ( @xmath8 ) , the proper eccentricity ( @xmath9 ) , and the proper inclination ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "they are close equivalents of their osculating element counterparts in that they define the size , elongation and tilt of orbits ( see note 1 in section 9 ) .    the definition of proper elements as quasi - integrals of asteroid motion , and the methods used to compute them , were explained in the asteroids iii book ( kneevi et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "as these definitions and methods have not changed much , we do not discuss them here in detail . in brief , the proper elements are obtained from the instantaneous osculating orbital elements by removing periodic oscillations produced by gravitational perturbations of planets .",
    "this can be done analytically , using perturbation theory ( milani and kneevi , 1990 , 1994 ) , or numerically , by integrating the orbits and applying the fourier analysis ( kneevi and milani , 2000 ; kneevi et al . , 2002 )",
    "( note 2 ) .",
    "the computation of analytic proper elements is relatively cpu inexpensive .",
    "they are made publicly available by a. milani for both numbered and unnumbered multi - opposition asteroids at the astdys node ( note 3 ) .",
    "the analytic proper elements lose precision for highly - inclined orbits , because the expansion of the gravitational potential used to calculate them has poor convergence for high inclinations .",
    "the more - precise synthetic proper elements ( precision generally at least 3 times better than that of analytic elements ) , on the other hand , require a much larger cpu investment , and are only made available at the astdys node for the numbered asteroids .    *",
    "2.2 clustering algorithm *    when these methods are applied to the asteroid belt , things are brought into focus with dozens of obvious clumps , asteroid families , emerging from the background ( figure [ fam]a ) . to identify an asteroid family ,",
    "researchers apply a clustering algorithm to the distribution of asteroids in ( @xmath11 ) space .",
    "the most commonly used algorithm is the hierarchical clustering method ( hcm ; zappal et al . ,",
    "1990 ) ( note 4 ) , which defines a cutoff distance , @xmath12 , and requires that the length of the link between two neighboring orbits clustered by the algorithm is @xmath13 . a common definition of distance is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the orbital frequency , ( @xmath16 ) is the separation vector between orbits in 3d space of proper elements , and @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19 are coefficients of the order of unity .",
    "the main advantage of the hcm over other methods is that there is no strong assumption built into the hcm about the shape of an asteroid family in proper element space .",
    "this is because the chain created by linking nearby orbits can track down family members even if their orbits dynamically evolved to produce an unusual overall shape .",
    "a prime example of this is the case of the koronis family which is split into two parts by the secular resonance @xmath20 at @xmath212.92  au , where @xmath22 is the apsidal frequency of an asteroid , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 and the 5th and 6th apsidal frequencies of the planetary system .",
    "the part of the koronis family with @xmath25  au has larger eccentricity than the part with @xmath26  au , because family members drifting by the yarkovsky effect from @xmath26  au have their eccentricities increased by interacting with the @xmath20 resonance ( bottke et al . ,",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the main disadvantage of the standard hcm , which becomes increasingly difficult to overcome with inclusion of numerous small asteroids in the new catalogs , is the problem of _",
    "this problem arises because small fragments are typically ejected at higher speeds and have larger mobility due to the yarkovsky effect .",
    "they therefore spread more , tend to be distributed more homogeneously throughout the main belt , and create bridges between different families if a single ( large ) value of @xmath12 is used .",
    "clearly , @xmath12 should be set proportional to the asteroid size , or inversely proportional to the absolute magnitude  @xmath27 . expressing this dependence ,",
    "however , adds additional parameters to the hcm and makes the whole identification procedure more complex .",
    "therefore , in reality , it is preferred to bypass the problem of chaining by artificial means ( e.g. , cuts in proper element space applied to deal with individual cases ) , or the proportionality is approximated by a two - step method with different cutoffs for small and large bodies ( milani et al . , 2014 ) .",
    "a tricky part of the hcm algorithm is the choice of the cutoff distance .",
    "if the value of @xmath12 is too small , many dispersed but real families will remain unnoticed and large families will artificially be split into parts . if the value is too large , the algorithm will clump different families together , and will identify irrelevant clumps produced by random fluctuations .",
    "while many asteroid families can be identified for a wide range of @xmath12 values , and are real beyond doubt , some cases require a specific choice of @xmath12 and can potentially be confused with random fluctuations .",
    "clearly , the _ statistical significance _ of the identified groups , or their insignificance , needs to be established before proceeding further .",
    "* 2.3 statistical significance *    to make reasonably sure that families identified from the hcm are real one can opt for a conservative choice of @xmath12 .",
    "this can be done , for example , by collecting asteroids in a given region of proper element space and redistributing them randomly in that region .",
    "the hcm applied to this artificial distribution will reveal that the largest identified group with given @xmath12 contains @xmath28 members .",
    "now , this procedure can be repeated , say , one thousand times , recording the largest @xmath28 obtained from these trials .",
    "we can then be 99% confident that random fluctuations can not produce groups with more that @xmath28 members ( this conservative estimate includes a 99% confidence interval computed by the wilson score interval approximation ) .",
    "any group identified in the _ real _ distribution with @xmath29 members is therefore reasonably likely to be real .",
    "higher confidence levels can be achieved by increasing the sample size .",
    "this basic concept , and various modifications of it , is known as the quasi random level ( qrl ; zappal et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "in the ideal world , the qrl would be the ultimate solution to the family identification problem : just choose @xmath12 and pick up all clumps with more than @xmath29 ; those clumps are real .",
    "then , there is the real world .",
    "first , the number density in proper element space is variable due to the primordial sculpting of the main belt and resonances ( e.g. , minton and malhotra , 2009 ) . applying a _ global _ qrl value in ( parts of ) the main belt may therefore lead to unsatisfactory results .",
    "second , families do not live in isolation but are frequently close to each other , overlap , and/or are surrounded by empty regions .",
    "this introduces an ambiguity in the qrl definition , because it is not clear a priori what region in ( @xmath11 ) space should be considered to define the _ local _ qrl in the first place .",
    "results may depend on this choice .    in practice ,",
    "the first choice made is often the minimum number of group members , @xmath30 , that is considered to be interesting .",
    "then , the cutoff distance @xmath12 in some local region in ( @xmath11 ) is defined such that groups of @xmath31 members can not be produced with @xmath12 by random fluctuations . all groups with @xmath31",
    "are then treated as meaningful asteroid families .",
    "different researchers made different choices : @xmath32 in zappal et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , @xmath33 in parker et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , and @xmath34 - 20 in most other publications .",
    "the two disadvantages of this method are that : meaningful asteroid families with @xmath35 members are explicitly avoided , and @xmath36 depends on the population density in proper element space and must be recomputed when a new classification is attempted from ever - growing catalogs .    another approach to this problem is to identify all groups , even if they have only a few members , and establish their statistical significance _",
    "a posteriori_. those that are judged to be insignificant are subsequently discarded and do not appear in the final lists . to determine the statistical significance of a group , one can generate mock distributions and apply the hcm to them .",
    "for example , the high statistical significance of the karin family , which is embedded in the much larger koronis family , can be demonstrated by generating thousand orbital distributions corresponding to the koronis family , and applying the hcm to each one ( nesvorn et al . , 2002a ) .",
    "with @xmath37 m s@xmath3 , no concentrations in this input can be found containing more than a few dozen members , while the karin family currently has 541 known members .",
    "therefore , the karin family is significant at a greater than the 99% level ( again including a 99% confidence interval of the estimate ) . a systematic application of this or similar statistical arguments can be quite laborious if many borderline cases need to be resolved .",
    "* 2.4 overlap problem and interlopers *    the overlap between different families has become more of a problem with a progressively larger share being taken in the proper element catalogs by small , km and sub - km size asteroids .",
    "this is because small fragments are generally launched at higher speeds , and are therefore initially spread in a larger volume in ( @xmath11 ) space .",
    "mainly , however , the problem is caused by the larger mobility of small fragments due to the yarkovsky effect .",
    "for example , the mean drift rate of a diameter @xmath38 km main belt asteroid is estimated to be @xmath39 au / m.y .",
    "( bottke et al . , 2006 ) .",
    "the km - size members of a 1-g.y .",
    "old family are therefore expected to be dispersed over @xmath40 au ( the additional factor of two accounts here for fragments having different spin orientations , and thus @xmath41 or @xmath42 ) , which is roughly 1/5 of the extension of the whole main belt .",
    "in addition , drifting asteroids encounter orbital resonances and can be dispersed by them in @xmath9 and @xmath10 as well .",
    "a good illustration of this is the case of the flora and vesta families in the inner main belt . to separate these families from each other down to their smallest members",
    ", the scope of the hcm can be restricted by an artificial cut in proper element space .",
    "alternatively , one can first apply the hcm to the distribution of large members , thus identifying the core of each family , and then proceeding by trying to `` attach '' the small members to the core .",
    "this second step must use a lower @xmath12 value than the first step to account for the denser population of smaller asteroids . in practice , this has been done by applying an absolute magnitude cutoff , @xmath43 , with @xmath44 for the core and @xmath45 for the rest . in the low-@xmath46 portion of the inner main belt , where the flora and vesta families reside , milani et al .",
    "( 2014 ) opted to use @xmath47 , and identified cores of families with @xmath48 and @xmath49 m s@xmath3 , and small members with @xmath50 and @xmath51 m s@xmath3 .",
    "another solution to the overlap problem is to consider the _",
    "physical _ properties of asteroids .",
    "previously , the spectroscopic observations of members of dynamical families have been used to : ( 1 ) establish the physical homogeneity of asteroid families ( the difference between physical properties of members of the same family tends to be smaller than the differences between physical properties of different families ) , and ( 2 ) identify large interlopers ( asteroids classified as family members based on proper elements but having spectroscopic properties distinct from the bulk of the family ) . with the color and albedo data from the sdss and wise ( note 5 ) ,",
    "the physical homogeneity of asteroid families has been demonstrated to hold down to the smallest observable members ( ivezi et al . , 2001 ; parker et al .",
    ", 2008 ; see figure [ fam]b ) .",
    "a straightforward implication of this result is that the interior of each disrupted body was ( relatively ) homogeneous , at least on a scale comparable to the size of the observed fragments ( @xmath521 - 100 km ) ( note 6 ) .",
    "the physical homogeneity of asteroid families can be used to identify _ interlopers _ as those members of a dynamical family that have color and/or albedo significantly distinct from the rest of the family .",
    "the number density of apparent color / albedo interlopers in a family can then be compared with the number density of the same color / albedo asteroids in the immediate neighborhood of the family .",
    "similar densities are expected if the identified bodies are actual interlopers in the family .",
    "if , on the other hand , the density of color / albedo outliers in the family is found to be substantially higher than in the background , this may help to rule out the interloper premise , and instead indicate that : ( i ) the disrupted parent body may have been heterogeneous , or ( ii ) we are looking at two or more overlapping dynamical families with distinct color / albedo properties . finally , as for ( ii ) , it is useful to verify whether the family members with different color / albedo properties also have different proper element distributions , as expected if breakups happened in two ( slightly ) different locations in proper element space ( e.g. , the nysa - polana complex ; see figure [ nysa ] ) .",
    "* 2.5 families in extended space *    another useful strategy is to include the color and/or albedo information _ directly _ in the clustering algorithm .",
    "this can be done by first separating the main belt into two ( or more ) populations according to their color and albedo properties .",
    "for example , asteroids in the s - complex can be separated from those in the c / x - complex based on the sdss colors ( nesvorn et al .",
    "2005 ) , and the high - albedo asteroids can be separated from the low - albedo asteroids based on the albedo measurements of wise ( masiero et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "the hcm is then applied to these populations separately .",
    "this method is capable of identifying small / dispersed s - complex families in the c / x - type background , and vice - versa , or low - albedo families in the high - albedo background , and vice - versa .",
    "it can also be useful to characterize the so - called family `` halos '' ( section 6.4 ) .    a more general method for including the color / albedo information in the clustering algorithm consists in the application of the hcm in space of increased dimension ( e.g. , parker et al .",
    "2008 ; carruba et al . ,",
    "when considering the proper elements and sdss colors , the distance in 5d can be defined as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the distance in 3d space of proper elements defined in section 2.2 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are two diagnostic colors defined from the sdss ( ivezi et al . , 2001 ;",
    "nesvorn et al . ,",
    "2005 ) , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are coefficients whose magnitude is set to provide a good balance between the orbital and color dimensions ( e.g. , nesvorn et al . , 2006b ) .",
    "similarly , we can define @xmath59 ( in 4d ) and @xmath60 ( in 6d ) to include the measurements of albedo @xmath61 from wise .",
    "the @xmath62 metric applies the strictest criteria on the family membership , because it requires that the family members have similar proper elements , similar colors , and similar albedos .",
    "note , however , that this metric can only be applied to a reduced set of main belt asteroids for which the proper elements , colors and albedos are _ simultaneously _ available ( presently @xmath2125,000 ; figure [ fam]b ) .    * 2.6 very young families in orbital element space *    short after family s creation , when the mutual gravity effects among individual fragments cease to be important , the fragments will separate from each other and find themselves moving on heliocentric orbits . initially",
    ", they will have very tightly clustered orbits with nearly the same values of the osculating orbital angles @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath63 is the nodal longitude , @xmath64 is the apsidal longitude , and @xmath65 is the mean longitude .",
    "the debris cloud will be subsequently dispersed by the ( i ) _ keplerian shear _",
    "( different fragments are ejected with different velocity vectors , have slightly different values of the semimajor axis , and therefore different orbital periods ) and ( ii ) _ differential precession _ of orbits produced by planetary perturbations .    as for ( i ) , the fragments will become fully dispersed along an orbit on a timescale @xmath66 , where @xmath67 - 4 yr is the orbital period and @xmath68 is the ejection speed . with @xmath69 - 100 m",
    "s@xmath3 , this gives @xmath70 - 30,000 yr .",
    "therefore , the dispersal of fragments along the orbit is relatively fast , and the clustering in @xmath65 is _ not _ expected if a family is older than a few tens of thousand years .",
    "the dispersal of @xmath63 and @xmath64 occurs on a time scale @xmath71 , where the frequency @xmath72 or @xmath22 .",

    "a correct identification of the brightest / largest members in a family is important for several reasons .",
    "for example , the spectroscopic observations are magnitude limited and can typically only be conducted for bright targets .",
    "the interpretation of spectroscopic observations of asteroid families , and implications for the homogeneity / heterogeneity of their parent bodies , therefore depend on whether the bright asteroids are the _ actual _ members of a family , or not ( e.g. , reddy et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "the large objects in families are also critically important for asteroid impact studies , in which the size frequency distribution ( sfd ) of family members is used to calibrate the results of impact experiments .",
    "finally , the uncertainty in the membership of the largest family members critically affects our estimates of size of the disrupted parent bodies ( e.g. , durda et al . , 2007 ) .",
    "while the interloper problem may not have an ideal solution , there exists a straightforward method that can be used to remove obvious bright / large interlopers based on dynamical considerations .",
    "this method is inspired by the `` v - shape '' of asteroid families , which becomes apparent when the absolute magnitude @xmath27 of family members is plotted against @xmath110 ( figure  [ eulalia ] ) .",
    "the v shape results from two processes . first , larger ( smaller ) fragments tend to be ejected at lower ( higher ) speeds , and thus tend to be located , on average , closer to ( further away from ) the family center ( see chapter by michel et al . in this volume ) .",
    "the second and typically more dominant v is contributed by the yarkovsky effect .",
    "the yarkovsky effect ( ye ) is a recoil force produced by anisotropic emission of thermal photons from an asteroid surface ( see chapter by vokrouhlick et al . in this volume ) .",
    "the diurnal component of the ye , which is more important for asteroid - sized bodies than its seasonal counterpart , can increase the semimajor axis of an asteroid with a prograde rotation and decrease the semimajor axis for a retrograde rotation .",
    "the semimajor axis drift is generally given by @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the asteroid obliquity , @xmath113 is the effective diameter , and the constant depends on material properties .",
    "the maximum drift occurs for @xmath114 or @xmath115 .",
    "thus , the envelope of the distribution of family members in @xmath116 is expected to follow @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the family center ( often assumed to coincide with the largest fragment ) , and @xmath119 is a constant related to @xmath5 ( section 5 ) .",
    "interestingly , if the ejection speed @xmath120 , as found for the youngest families ( e.g. , nesvorn et al .",
    ", 2006a ) and some laboratory experiments ( e.g. , fujiwara et al . , 1989 ) , then the ejection velocity field will produce the same dependence , @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is related to the magnitude of the ejection velocities .",
    "these considerations allow us to define the v - shape criterion ( e.g. , nesvorn et al . , 2003 ) .",
    "consider a family extracted by the hcm as described in section 2.2 .",
    "fit an envelope to the distribution of small family members in @xmath116 using the functional dependence between @xmath8 and @xmath27 defined above .",
    "the envelope is then continued to low @xmath27 values , and the bright members of the hcm family that fall _ outside _ the envelope boundaries can be rejected . on the other hand ,",
    "the brightest hcm family members that fall _ within _ the envelope boundaries are good candidates for the largest family members .",
    "this method is  illustrated  in  figure  [ eulalia ] .    in practice",
    ", a number of additional effects can complicate the application of the v - shape criterion described above .",
    "for example , strong nearby resonances can remove family members that drifted into them , thus producing cutoffs of the @xmath123 distribution beyond which no family members can be identified ( e.g. , the 3:1 resonance in figure [ eulalia ] ) .",
    "also , family members can be displaced in @xmath8 by encounters with ( 1 ) ceres and other massive main belt asteroids ( nesvorn et al . , 2002b ; carruba et al . , 2003 , 2007a , 2012 , 2013b ; delisle and laskar , 2012 ) .",
    "in addition , the physics of large scale collisions is still poorly understood , and the possibility that some large fragments can be accelerated to very high speeds can not be ruled out .",
    "therefore , while the v - shape criterion defined above is a useful guide , it can not be _ rigidly _ applied .",
    "possibly the best way to deal with this issue is to define the value of @xmath124 that best fits the v - shaped family envelope and report @xmath125 , where @xmath126 , for each family member @xmath127 identified by the hcm .",
    "asteroids with @xmath128 can be flagged ( but not removed ) , because they are potential interlopers in a dynamical family according to the v - shape criterion .",
    "the results can then be cross - linked with the spectroscopic data ( or colors , or albedo measurements ) to determine whether there is a good correspondence between the flagged bodies and ( suspected ) spectroscopic interlopers .",
    "an illustration of this procedure can be found in vokrouhlick et al .",
    "( 2006a ) who examined the eos family .",
    "they found that many large bodies in the hcm family with @xmath128 have physical properties that are indeed incompatible ( mainly dark c types ) with the bulk of the eos family ( mainly brighter k types ) .",
    "the method of backward integrations of orbits described in section 3 can not be used to determine ages of the families much older than @xmath5210 m.y .",
    ", mainly because the orbital evolution of main belt asteroids is generally unpredictable on long timescales and sensitively depends on non - gravitational effects that are difficult to model with the needed precision . instead",
    ", the age of an old family can be estimated by a _ statistical _ method , which is based on the general notion that the spread of an asteroid family in @xmath8 increases over time as its members drift away due to the yarkovsky effect . expressed in terms of the equations discussed in the previous section",
    ", the age can be estimated  as @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the asteroid bulk density and @xmath131 is the visual albedo . while the equation above is scaled to typical values expected for an s - type asteroid , a change to @xmath132 g @xmath133 and @xmath134 , which would be more appropriate for a dark c - type asteroid , produces two multiplication factors that nearly compensate each other .",
    "the biggest uncertainty in the inversion from @xmath135 to @xmath5 lies in the unknown density factor . additional uncertainty , not explicitly apparent from eq .",
    "( 2 ) , stems from the dependence of the drift rate on surface conductivity @xmath136 .",

    "this happens , in essence , because this simple method only fits the family envelope .",

    "the yarkovsky - yorp ( hereafter yy ) code then evolves the orbits of fragments accounting for the semimajor axis drift due to the ye , and the spin evolution from the yorp effect ( rubincam , 2000 ) . to speed up the calculation ,",
    "planetary perturbations were not taken into account in the original yy code ( but see masiero et al . ,",
    "2012 ; results based on full @xmath140-body integrations are discussed in the following section ) .    when applied to an asteroid family",
    ", the goal is to find a combination of parameters @xmath139 and @xmath5 that best fits the observed @xmath116 distribution in the family .",
    "since the model does not contain an sfd - related evolution component , this can be conveniently done by simply fitting the observed distribution of @xmath141 .",
    "the results are found to be credible in cases such as the erigone family ( figure [ erigone ] ) , where the yy model is capable of adequately representing the observed @xmath142 distribution , which shows void space near @xmath143 , a maximum at intermediate values of @xmath142 , and a relatively sharp drop toward the largest @xmath142 values seen in the family .",
    "this dependence is produced by the yorp effect which tilts the spin axis away from the orbital plane and therefore , through the @xmath144 dependence of the ye , tends to maximize the drift rates .",
    "this gives some asteroid families the characteristic appearance in @xmath116 , which different authors , with noticeably different gifts for subtleties of poetic expression , called `` ears '' , `` wings '' or `` petals '' .",
    "but not all families have ears , wings or petals . in fact , most families have more uniform distribution of @xmath142 that goes all the way from 0 to @xmath145 .",
    "this is thought to have something to do with how the ye and yorp operate on g.y .- long timescales .",
    "it is perhaps related to the variability of the spin - related yorp torque , which sensitively depends on small perturbations of the asteroid surface . as a result of this dependence ,",
    "the spin rate of each individual asteroid can undergo a random walk ( stochastic yorp ; bottke et al . , 2015 ) and , when spun down completely , the asteroid spin axis would chaotically tumble for some time , and subsequently reorient .",
    "this process could mix up the total drifts suffered by family members and , rather unpoetically , remove the ears , wings or petals from the old families .",
    "the application of the standard yy code ( and , for that matter , also of the simple method based on the ` v'-shape envelope ) is problematic in cases when a family is cut by nearby mean motion resonances and looks like a box in @xmath116 , or when @xmath122 is expected to be larger than @xmath119 , perhaps because the family s parent was an object with large escape speed ( e.g. , the vesta family ; ( 4 ) vesta has @xmath146 m s@xmath3 ) , or because the family formed recently ( e.g. , the datura , karin , veritas families have @xmath147 ) .",

    "the dynamical studies can also often provide an independent estimate of @xmath5 .    assuming that @xmath164 , the initial shape of families in @xmath165 can be obtained from the gauss equations ( e.g. , zappal et al . , 2002 ) , which map the initial velocity perturbation @xmath166 ) , where @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 are the radial , tangential and vertical components of the velocity vector , to the change of orbital elements @xmath170 .",
    "if the ejection velocity field is ( roughly ) isotropic , the gauss equations imply that initial families should ( roughly ) be ellipsoids in @xmath165 centered at the reference orbit @xmath171 . the transformation from @xmath165 to @xmath172 preserves the shape , but maps @xmath171 onto @xmath173 such that , in general , @xmath174 , @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",

    "the short - to - long axis ratio is roughly given by @xmath181 .",
    "thus , breakups near the ascending ( @xmath182 ) and descending ( @xmath183 ) nodes should produce ` fat ' ellipses while those with @xmath184 should make ` squashed ' ellipses with @xmath185 .",
    "while the karin family neatly fits in this framework with @xmath186 ( figure [ karin ] ) , the veritas family shows large @xmath187 values , indicating that the ejection velocity field should have been anisotropic with @xmath169 some @xmath188 - 4 times larger than @xmath168 .        the reference orbit @xmath173 is often taken to coincide with the proper orbit of a largest family member .",
    "this should be fine for families produced in cratering or mildly catastrophic events , where the orbital elements of the impacted body presumably did not change much by the impact .",
    "for the catastrophic and highly catastrophic breakups , however , the largest surviving remnant is relatively small and can be significantly displaced from the family s center .",
    "for example , ( 832 ) karin , the largest @xmath2117-km - diameter member of the karin family produced by a catastrophic breakup of a @xmath2140-km - diameter parent body ( mass ratio @xmath520.08 ; nesvorn et al . , 2006a ) , is displaced by @xmath189  au from the family center ( @xmath2120% of the whole extension of the karin family in @xmath8 ) .",

    "if the resonance is strong enough ( e.g. , 3:1 , 2:1 , or 5:2 with jupiter ) , the orbit will chaotically wander near the resonance border , its eccentricity will subsequently increase , and the body will be removed from the main belt and transferred onto a planet - crossing orbit ( wisdom , 1982 ) . if the resonance is weak , or if the asteroid is small and drifts fast in @xmath8 , the orbit can cross the resonance , perhaps suffering a discontinuity in @xmath9 during the crossing , and will continue drifting on the other side . if the resonance is weak and the drift rate is not too large , the orbit can be captured in the resonance and will slowly diffuse to larger or smaller eccentricities .",
    "it may later be released from the resonance with @xmath9 that can be substantially different from the original value .",
    "the effects of mean motion resonances on @xmath10 are generally smaller , because the eccentricity terms tend to be more important in the resonant potential .",
    "the inclination terms are important for orbits with @xmath191 .",
    "a good example of this is the pallas family with @xmath192 ( carruba et al . , 2011 ) .",
    "\\(2 ) drifting members meet a secular resonance .",
    "the secular resonances are located along curved manifolds in @xmath172 space ( kneevi et al . , 1991 ) .",
    "depending on the type and local curvature of the secular resonance , and asteroid s @xmath193 , the orbit can be trapped inside the resonance and start sliding along it , or it can cross the resonance with a noticeably large change of @xmath9 and/or @xmath10 .",
    "a good example of the former case are orbits in the eos family sliding along the @xmath194 resonance ( vokrouhlick et al . , 2006a ) .",

    "the long - term dynamics of the koronis family therefore has a relatively small influence on the overall width of the family in @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "in contrast , the present shift of the koronis family / halo members from the family s center is relatively large ( up to @xmath231 in @xmath9 and @xmath232 in @xmath10 ) .",

    "first , we collected a long list of all ( they were 228 ) families reported in these publications .",
    "second , we checked to see whether the clustering in proper elements of each reported group is meaningful , and whether the group has reasonably homogeneous colors and albedos ( see methods in section 2 ) .",
    "the families that passed the preliminary tests were scrutinized further to establish the best cutoff value @xmath12 ( the values of @xmath12 were informed from past publications ) , apply the v - shape criterion to identify large interlopers ( section 4 ) , and estimate @xmath5 from the envelope - based method ( section 5 ) .",
    "we made sure that each identified group with @xmath12 was complete ( i.e. , not missing any extension that would make sense dynamically ) , and not part of a larger structure . in some cases , a cut in proper element space was applied to avoid the problem of chaining . in several cases , following masiero et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , we used an albedo cutoff , @xmath241 , to identify dark families in the inner and central belts ( the ( 84 ) klio , ( 313 ) chaldaea , ( 2262 ) mitidika families ) .",
    "finally , we removed all identified families and searched for significant groups in the leftover population .",
    "this led to the identification of several additional families ( e.g. , the ( 589 ) croatia , ( 926 ) imhilde , ( 1332 ) marconia families in the outer belt ) .",
    "a difficulty we had to deal with is that different authors often listed the same family under different names .",
    "for example , masiero et al .",
    "( 2013 ) renamed the families after their largest fragments ( e.g. , the ( 158 ) koronis family was referred to as the ( 208 ) lacrimosa family ) .",
    "while it is very useful to identify the largest fragment , this naming convention creates chaos because some well - established family names disappear ( koronis , maria , flora , gefion , dora , etc . ) and new names are used to refer to the same groups ( lacrimosa , roma , augusta , gudiachvili , zhongolovich , etc . ) .",
    "it is also not clear in many cases what the true largest member is ( ( 208 ) lacrimosa is only slightly larger than ( 158 ) koronis , some large objects have peripheral orbits and can be interlopers , etc . ) .",
    "a simple solution to this problem is to think of the family names as of _ labels _ , used from historical and other reasons , which do not necessarily reveal what the largest or lowest - numbered asteroid is .",
    "thus , the koronis family would remain the koronis family , regardless of whether ( 158 ) koronis , ( 208 ) lacrimosa or some other large asteroid are the actual family members , largest or not .",
    "anticipating that some authors will still prefer to rename some families , here we assign each family a unique family identifier number ( fin ) .",
    "the fin goes from 101 to 399 for families identified from the analytic proper elements : 1xx for the inner belt ( 2 - 2.5 au ) , 2xx for the middle belt ( 2.5 - 2.82 au ) , and 3xx for the outer belt ( 2.82 - 3.7 au ) .",
    "the families identified from the synthetic proper elements were assigned the fin from 401 to 999 : 4xx and 7xx for the low and high inclination families in the inner belt , 5xx and 8xx for the low and high inclination families in the middle belt , and 6xx and 9xx for the low and high inclination families in the outer belt .",
    "the division between low and high inclinations was taken at @xmath242 ( @xmath243 ) which coincides with the highest inclinations for which the analytic proper elements are available .",
    "the fins of the low - inclination families are aligned such that 101 and 401 , 102 and 402 , 201 and 501 , etc .",
    ", are the same families identified from two different datasets .",
    "the families among hungarias with @xmath244  au , hildas with @xmath245  au , and jupiter trojans with @xmath246  au are given the fin between 001 and 099 .",
    "the main idea behind this notation is that even if a family is eventually renamed , its fin will remain the same .",
    "therefore , it should suffice to list the fin of the renamed family in a new publication to make it clear how the new name relates to the designation(s ) used in the past .",
    "for example , the koronis family is given the fin equal to 605 ( synthetic proper elements , outer belt , low @xmath46 , 5th notable family ) , and will remain 605 even if the name lacrimosa family will eventually be adopted .",
    "since , however , it can be easily checked that the koronis and lacrimosa families have the same fin ( assuming that authors list the fin in their publications ) , it will be crystal clear that we deal the same family .",
    "a potential difficulty with this scheme would arise if families that were previously assigned a fin are often found to be nonexistent ( say , because they are later found statistically insignificant or part of a large structure that was not evident in the original data ) .",
    "we suggest that such families are deleted and the associated fins are left void ( i.e. , not assigned to any family ) such that there is no source for confusion . finally , to avoid having many void fins and not to run out of the fins with the three digit scheme described above",
    ", the fin should be given only to families that are reasonably secure .",
    "other , less secure families can be tentatively listed as family candidates and can wait for their fin until the situation becomes clear with the new data .",
    "if the number of families in the inner , middle and/or outer belts exceeds 99 , the 3-digit fin scheme described here can be easily modified to a 4-digit scheme by adding 0 at the second decimal digit , such that , e.g. , fin=401 ( the vesta family ) becomes fin=4001 .",

    "this affects the following families : ( 8) flora ( split in 4 parts ) , ( 31 ) euphrosyne ( 3 parts ) , ( 221 ) eos ( 5 parts ) , ( 702 ) alauda ( 4 parts ) , ( 1400 ) tirela ( 8 parts ) , ( 2085 ) henan ( 4 parts ) , ( 4203 ) brucato ( 4 parts ) ( here we only list families that were split to three or more parts in m14 ) .",
    "it is clear from several different arguments that the list of known families must be largely incomplete .",
    "for example , most families with an estimated parent body size below @xmath21100 - 200 km are found to have ages @xmath7 g.y .",
    "( e.g. , bro et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "in contrast , the rate of impacts in the main belt , and therefore the rate of family - forming events , should have been roughly unchanging with time over the past @xmath213.5 g.y .",
    "( and probably raised quite a bit toward the earliest epochs ) .",
    "so , there must be many missing families with the formation ages @xmath256 g.y .",
    "( note 12 ) .",
    "these families are difficult to spot today , probably because they have been dispersed by dynamical processes , lost members by collisional grinding , and therefore do not stand out sufficiently well above the dense main - belt background ( they are now part of the background ) .",
    "the significant incompleteness of known families is also indicated by the extrapolation of the number of families detected in the 2.82 - 2.96  au zone to the whole main belt . as we hinted on at the end of the last section ,",
    "the 2.82 - 2.96  au zone is sparsely populated such that asteroid families can be more easily detected there .",
    "nearly 20 families with @xmath257 were identified in this region . in comparison , the 2.96 - 3.3  au zone , where also @xmath2120 families with @xmath257 can be found ,",
    "is about twice as wide as the 2.82 - 2.96  au zone and contains about twice as many large asteroids .",
    "a straightforward conclusion that can be inferred from this comparison , assuming everything else being equal , is that the families in the 2.96 - 3.3  au zone are ( at least ) a factor of @xmath522 incomplete .",
    "a similar argument applies to the inner and central belts .",
    "this is actually good news for future generations of planetary scientists , because this field is open for new discoveries . figuring out how to find the missing asteroid families with @xmath258 g.y .",
    "will not be easy .",
    "one way forward would be to improve our capability to model the dynamical evolution of main belt asteroids over g.y .",
    "timescales , such that we can rewind the clock and track fragments back to their original orbits .",
    "the modeling of the yarkovsky effect could be improved , for example , if we knew the spin states , densities , conductivity , etc .",
    ", of small main - belt asteroids on individual basis .",
    "another approach would consist in identifying families based on the physical properties of their members . while this method is already in use ,",
    "mainly thanks to data from the sdss and wise , we anticipate that it can be pushed much further , say , with automated spectroscopic surveys , or , in more distant future , with routine sampling missions .",
    "* note 1 *  alternatively , one can use the frequencies @xmath15 , @xmath22 and @xmath195 ( carruba and michtchenko , 2007 , 2009 ) , where @xmath15 is the mean orbital frequency and @xmath22 and @xmath195 are the ( constant ) precession frequencies of the proper perihelion longitude @xmath259 and the proper nodal longitude @xmath260 , respectively .",
    "the use of frequencies , instead of the proper elements , can be helpful for asteroid families near or inside the secular orbital resonances ( e.g. the tina family in the @xmath261 resonance ; carruba and morbidelli , 2011 ) .",
    "* note 2 *  additional methods were developed and/or adapted for specific populations of asteroids such as the ones on the high - inclination and high - eccentricity orbits ( lematre and morbidelli , 1994 ) or in orbital resonances ( morbidelli , 1993 ; milani , 1993 ; beaug and roig , 2001 ; bro and vokrouhlick , 2008 ; bro and rozehnal , 2011 ) .      * note 4 *  see chapter bendjoya and zappal ( 2002 ) in the asteroids iii book for a discussion of other clustering algorithms such as the wavelet analysis method ( wam ) and d - criterion .",
    "the wam was shown to produce results that are in a good agreement with those obtained from the hcm ( zappal et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "the d - criterion was originally developed to identify meteorite streams ( southwork and hawkins , 1963 ) .",
    "these methods have not been used for the classification of asteroid families in the past decade , and we therefore do not discuss them here .    *",
    "note 5 *  the sdss measured flux densities in five bands with effective wavelengths 354 , 476 , 628 , 769 , and 925 nm . the wise mission measured fluxes in four wavelengths ( 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22  @xmath222 m ) , and combined the measurements with a thermal model to calculate albedos ( @xmath61 ) and diameters ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "the latest public releases of these catalogs include color or albedo data for over 100,000 main belt asteroids with known orbits , of which about 25,000 have _ both _ the color and albedo measurements .",

    "it can also be the source of carbonaceous chondrites ( clark et al . , 2009 )",
