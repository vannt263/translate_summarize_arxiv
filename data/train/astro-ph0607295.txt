    "since the first announcement of a planet orbiting a sun - like star , 51 peg , by @xcite , around 140 stars with planets ( swps ) have been reported .",
    "the main properties of swps have been investigated by many works . among these , spectroscopic observations of most swps based on high - resolution and high signal - to - noise ratio spectra have been carried out .",
    "all of these works indicate a high mean metallicity of swps relative to normal field stars .",
    "are there any other chemical signatures for swps ? there is no conclusive result on this issue , and only a few works have reported abundance anomalies in some elements .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested a high [ c / fe ] ratio for swps as compared with the normal stars from @xcite .",
    "however , they later reported that there is no difference in abundance for c , na , mg , and al elements between swps and normal stars @xcite .",
    "present knowledge on the abundances of 25 elements ( except for li and be ) available in the literature shows no special feature for swps except for the high overall metallicity .    for lithium abundance , @xcite claimed that @xmath0 was detected in the atmosphere of hd 82943 , while @xcite did not confirm this detection .",
    "@xcite reported no @xmath1 presence in several lithium - poor stars .",
    "for @xmath2 , @xcite first found several swps with low li abundances , and they related them with the presence of a planetary companion .",
    "@xcite concluded that smaller li abundances are found for swps after correcting for trends with temperature , metallicity , and age .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that there is no significant difference in lithium abundance for swps , and later work by @xcite agreed with ryan s conclusion . with a large sample",
    ", @xcite suggested again that in the temperature range 56005850k , swps show additional depletion of li compared to normal stars .",
    "they also showed that for higher temperatures , the li abundances were similar for swps and for normal stars .",
    "recently , measurements of be abundances by @xcite indicated further evidence on the composition difference between stars with and without planets .",
    "lithium is a special element because it is easily destroyed in stars during even pre  main sequence and main sequence evolution , which is not the case for other elements .",
    "therefore , li abundance reflects the mixing history of the star . for swps , li is further related with the accretion of material and the angular  momentum evolution of the system , and thus li abundances have been used to distinguish the current hypotheses on planet formation mechanisms . in this respect , it is important to verify whether li abundance anomalies for swps at the temperature range of 56005850k reported by @xcite are real , which will provide new information on the planet formation process and its influence on host stars .    in this work",
    "we conduct a parallel abundance analysis of lithium abundances for 16 swps and 20 comparison stars in the same metallicity of @xmath3}}\\sim 0.1 $ ] dex at the temperature range of 56005900k in order to investigate whether any anomalies persist .",
    "furthermore , this study is quite interesting for our understanding of the lithium behavior of solar metallicity stars , which show a large scatter at @xmath4 k and which the standard model of stellar evolution can not explain . with a consistent analysis procedure",
    ", this work aims to investigate the effect of planet presence on stellar evolution .",
    "this will provide new information on the chemical evolution of lithium in the galaxy .",
    "swps are selected from a catalog in the temperature range of 56005900k , and their spectra are available from our observations with the 2.16 m telescope of the national astronomical observatories ( xinglong , china ) with a resolving power of 37000 , or from @xcite , who observed with the 1.93 m telescope of the observatoire de haute provence with r@xmath542000 .",
    "@xcite present a database of high  resolution spectra of 709 stars covering a large range of atmospheric parameters , which enables us to select a comparison sample of stars spanning the same ranges in temperature , gravity and metallicity as the above sample of planet stars but not having been reported to harbor planets .",
    "that is , both samples cover the atmospheric parameters of @xmath4 k , @xmath6 , and @xmath3 } } > -0.3 $ ] . in the selection ,",
    "strmgren @xmath7 indices from @xcite are adopted and the metallicity is estimated based on the calibrations by @xcite .",
    "along with the initial metallicity , temperature and gravity are derived in the same way as described below .",
    "all spectra have signal - to - noise ratios above 150 pixel@xmath8 at the @xmath96707 line .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard midas ( for xinglong data ) and iraf ( for elodie data ) routines for order definition , background correction , flat - fielding , extraction of echelle orders , wavelength calibration , and continuum fitting .",
    "the lines suitable for measurement were carefully selected , and the equivalent widths ( ews ) were obtained by the fitting of a gaussian function .",
    "atomic data for lines were the same as those in @xcite . the wavelengths and oscillator strengths of the @xmath96707 line",

    "the gravities were determined via _ hipparcos _ parallaxes @xcite , and the microturbulences were obtained by forcing lines with different strengths to give the same abundances . * here",
    "the oscillator strengths of the lines are taken from @xcite . *",
    "the new metallicity derived from spectroscopic analysis was updated , and the procedure of atmospheric parameter determination was iterated for consistency , even though there is no systematic difference between the initial metallicity and the new value , with a deviation of @xmath26 dex .",
    "the internal errors of the atmospheric parameters are around 70k in temperature , 0.1 dex in @xmath11 , 0.1 dex in @xmath3}}$ ] , and 0.3 @xmath14 in microturbulence .",
    "but the absolute uncertainties of the stellar parameters may be slightly larger .",
    "we have found that the photometry - based temperatures in the work are 130 k lower than the spectroscopically  derived values in @xcite for swps in common . however , our temperatures are 83 k higher than those in @xcite , who derive temperatures by spectroscopic method for 29 stars in common .",
    "it seems that spectroscopically ",
    "derived temperatures have significant uncertainties , and the values depend on stellar model atmosphere , the selection of lines , the adopted atomic data , and the way the temperatures are determined . in addition , as already noted by @xcite , surface gravities determined from the balance of and abundances are systematically higher than those derived from parallaxes ( adopted in our work ) by the order of 0.150.20 dex . however , iron abundances in this work and @xcite are similar since we adopted iron abundances from lines and they forced and lines to give the same iron abundances when they derived gravities . for the comparison stars , there are 15 stars in common with @xcite , and our temperatures are 87k lower than their values .",
    "this is due to different temperature calibrations , and our values , based on the infrared flux method temperatures by @xcite , may be more reliable . actually , the absolute temperature and gravity are not very important , since we are carrying out a differential analysis , and it is crucial that the stellar parameters all be in the same scale between the target and the comparison sample .",
    "the model atmospheres were interpolated from a grid of plane - parallel , lte models provided by @xcite in which convective overshoot is switched off .",
    "the abontest8 program developed by p. magain in the lige group was used to carry out the calculations of theoretical line ews , and abundances were derived by matching the theoretical ews to the observed values .",
    "abundance errors , estimated from the uncertainties of atmospheric parameters and ews , are 0.07 dex for iron abundances , and less than 0.1 dex for li abundances . here",
    "the contribution of the @xmath27 isotope to the @xmath96707 line was assumed to be negligible .",
    "finally , non - lte corrections were applied to the derived li abundances based on the work by @xcite , who studied non - lte formation of the @xmath28 line as a function of effective temperature , gravity , metallicity , and li abundance .",
    "stellar parameters and li and fe abundances for swps and the comparison stars , as well as the ews of the lines and their errors are shown in table 1 .",
    "li abundances as a function of metallicity for all stars in the present survey are shown in fig . 1 ,",
    "in which stars with downward  directed arrows have an undetected lithium line , and the symbol size corresponds to stellar age .",
    "the upper limits of the li abundances are estimated by assuming ews of 3.0 m , which is the estimated error in ew from the comparison used in @xcite .",
    "based on table 1 , the scatter of the ew comparison between this work and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite is around 4.0 m , which indicates an error of @xmath29 massuming the same uncertainties for the ews from the other works .",
    "note that the statistical uncertainties based on the formula by @xcite , presented in table 1 , are smaller .",
    "since experimental errors by different authors during spectrum normalization and ew measurements are not considered in cayrel s ( 1988 ) formula , we believe that an upper limit to the ews of 3.0 m  for stars with an undetected li line may be more reasonable .",
    "an interesting result from fig .",
    "1 is that there is a lack of normal stars with @xmath3 } } > + 0.2 $ ] .",
    "this suggestion is supported by large samples of stars in the literature .",
    "there are 22% normal stars with @xmath3 } } > + 0.2 $ ] in @xcite s sample at the temperature range of 56005900k , but note that their temperatures , derived from the fitting of synthetic spectra with observed spectra , are 107k higher than our values for stars in common , and the sample is too small for statistics . with photometry - based temperatures and a larger sample of stars from @xcite , this fraction is reduced to 2% , indicating a low probability of super  metal  rich stars in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that most metal  rich stars tend to have formed planetary systems , and thus it is difficult to obtain a comparison sample that consists of super  metal  rich stars not harboring a planet .",
    "this is consistent with the current knowledge that swps have higher mean metallicities than normal stars .    the second feature from fig .",
    "1 is that six of the 16 swps versus two of the 20 normal stars have undetected lithium lines .",
    "all of the six swps with undetected li lines are main  sequence stars while the two normal stars with depleted li abundances are subgiants , as shown below ( fig .  5 ) .",
    "it seems that main  sequence swps in the temperature range of 56005900k destroy their li much more easily than do normal stars .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov test is applied to stars with and without planets , and the cumulative distribution functions are shown in fig .",
    "it shows that the maximum value of the absolute difference between the two distribution functions is 0.54 , and the probability for the two samples being the same group is 0.007 .",
    "this is also evident from @xcite , as shown in fig .  3 , in which eight of 16 main  sequence swps at @xmath30 k only have upper limits for li abundances , while three of the 14 normal main  sequence stars from @xcite are depleted in li .",
    "note that the two comparison samples , from this work and @xcite , are independently selected with six common stars .",
    "thus , this property could be intrinsic , but further investigations with large samples of both swps and normal stars are needed .",
    "if this suggestion that main  sequence swps have a higher probability of depleting their lithium abundances is true , it will provide new information on stellar evolution for swps .",
    "we suspect that the stellar evolution history between swps and normal stars could be somewhat different due to the presence of a planet , which appears to affect only li abundances , with no other elements showing any difference .",
    "as suggested by @xcite , the presence of planets or associated circumstellar disks may affect a parent star s initial angular momentum and/or subsequent evolution . specifically , the conservation of angular momentum in the protoplanetary disk may induce increased mixing by causing rotational breaking in the host stars during the pre ",
    "main  sequence evolution .",
    "this effect , once it happens , will destroy the li completely . considering this suggestion as one possibility , @xcite proposed a second hypothesis : that migration triggers tidal forces and creates a shear instability that leads to a strong depletion of li abundance .",
    "both mechanisms occur during the pre ",
    "main  sequence evolution , and thus they can be used to explain our result .",
    "further theoretical and observational studies are very desirable to investigate whether the two mechanisms are reasonable .",
    "4 shows li abundances versus temperatures for all stars .",
    "it seems that li abundance generally increases with increasing @xmath10 , and there is no significant gap between swps and normal stars at a given temperature .",
    "5 shows the stellar positions of the two samples of stars in the hr diagram as compared with the evolutionary tracks of @xcite with @xmath3}}\\sim + 0.12 $ ] dex .",
    "stellar ages are also estimated from this comparison , and they are presented in table 1 .",
    "the error of the ages due to the uncertainties of @xmath10 , @xmath31 , and @xmath3}}$ ] is about 15% .",
    "it is clear that our two samples of stars are generally located in the same regions of the hr diagram , and during the selection all these stars are classified as main  sequence stars with similar parameters .",
    "however , the two stars from the comparison sample showing depleted li abundances , as indicated by downward  directed arrows in fig .  5 , are actually subgiants .",
    "other possible subgiant stars are not evolved far away from the main sequence , and there is no difference in li abundance between swps and normal stars .",
    "this observation that subgiants tend to have depleted li abundances reminds us to investigate the stellar positions of swps at @xmath30 k in @xcite .",
    "here we redetermined the temperatures for swps with @xmath30 k from @xcite in the same way as @xcite . in fig .  3 ,",
    "the stellar positions of these swps with new temperatures are plotted against normal stars from @xcite in this temperature range with @xmath3 } } > -0.3 $ ] .",
    "it is clear that a few swps in israelian et al.s ( 2004 ) sample based on the updated temperatures are actually evolved subgiants , and downward  directed arrows in fig .",
    "3 indicate stars with undetected @xmath96708 lines .",
    "the fact that evolved subgiants tend to have depleted li abundances is consistent with the knowledge of stellar evolution theory .    it has been suggested in @xcite that the li abundances of subgiants can be somewhat depleted due to the dilution proces without complete destruction , as opposed to main  sequence stars . in this scenario ,",
    "once a star evolves onto the subgiant branch , it dilutes surface li when convection brings li - poor material from deep layers to the surface .",
    "this dilution is not obvious for slightly evolved subgiants in the present study , and a few subgiants with 1.2 @xmath32 show higher li abundances than main  sequence stars .",
    "moreover , there is no difference in li abundance between planet hosts and normal stars on the subgiant branch .",
    "actually , the dilution process mentioned above is difficult to detect , and its effect is masked by the large scatter of li abundances for even slightly evolved subgiants .",
    "it is impossible to investigate how the presence of a planet will affect lithium evolution for evolved subgiants in the present work , since their li abundances have already been depleted due to their low temperatures .    as shown in fig .  4",
    ", there is a substantial scatter of li abundances at @xmath33 k. considering the uncertainty in temperature , it is difficult to investigate whether the scatter is real .",
    "there seems to be a tendency that stars in the upper envelope of the li versus @xmath10 diagram seem to be slightly younger than stars with the lowest li abundances in the @xmath34 k range .",
    "however , since there is a lack of young stars in the low  temperature range and of old stars at the high  temperature edge in our sample , we refrain from drawing any firm conclusions . a larger sample of stars with different ages at a given temperature",
    "is needed to clarify this issue .",
    "the excess of li depletion in swps in the temperature range of @xmath30 k suggested by @xcite is based on the fact that li abundances for swps are lower than for comparison stars .",
    "a closer comparison shows that the average of li abundances for 24 swps at this temperature range in @xcite is @xmath35 , while this value is @xmath36 for the comparison stars from @xcite . in our work",
    "the average li abundance is @xmath37 for swps versus @xmath38 for the comparison stars .",
    "as presented above , this anomaly in li abundance of swps might reflect the effect of planet presence on stellar evolution and can not be used to provide constraints on planet formation .",
    "in addition , this effect is difficult to detect from stars in the subgiant branch or later stages if their li abundances have already been depleted by other mechanisms .",
    "moreover , the deviations of the average li abundance between stars with and without planets are 0.27 dex for @xmath39 k and 0.58 dex for @xmath40k .",
    "it seems that li anomalies concentrate in the range of @xmath40k , and thus they do not relate to the li  dip in the hyades , which happens in the temperature range of 63006600k as first found by @xcite .    in connection with planet formation mechanism , our result does not support the accretion scenario of planet formation .",
    "theoretically , @xcite predicted quantitative estimates of the main  sequence evolution of stellar surface lithium after planet ingestion .",
    "they found that the preservation of @xmath41 occurs in a large mass range of 0.91.3 @xmath32 at solar metallicity .",
    "for swps with a typically super - solar metallicity , the mass range is slightly reduced . according to their theory ,",
    "if a 1 @xmath42 planet were dissolved in the convective envelope of an swp at a sufficiently old age for extra  mixing to be inefficient , it would produce an enhancement of 0.3 dex in li abundance , which is unfortunately within the scatter of li abundance at the temperature range we investigated .",
    "but li abundances for stars with @xmath43 k in @xcite do not show such a large scatter , and the similar abundance between swps and the comparison stars argues against the accretion scenario .",
    "furthermore , most swps known so far have giant planets with masses larger than @xmath44 , and if @xmath45 were engulfed the enhancement would reach 0.9 dex , which is easily detected .",
    "therefore , we favor the scenario that the surface composition of swps is not polluted by the accretion of planetary material , and the high mean metallicity of swps is primordial .",
    "we have made a parallel abundance analysis for 16 swps and 20 normal stars at the metallicity of @xmath46 } } < + 0.4 $ ] and the temperature range of @xmath4 k. our results show that there is a higher probability for swps to have depleted li abundances than for comparison stars , which confirms the possible li abundance anomalies for swps at this temperature range reported by @xcite after excluding evolved subgiants .",
    "we proposed that the presence of planets around host stars may affect stellar evolution by inducing additional mixing or shear instability , which leads to a high probability of destroying surface lithium while other elements are not affected .",
    "this effect can only be detected for main  sequence swps since other depletion mechanisms would not have started to act on main  sequence stars . in view of this , the effect of planet presence should be considered when the large scatters of the galactic lithium in field disk stars at the temperature range of @xmath4 k are investigated .",

    "<S> we have investigated the abundance anomalies of lithium for stars with planets in the temperature range of 56005900k reported by israelian and coworkers , as compared to 20 normal stars at the same temperature and metallicity ranges . </S>",
    "<S> our result indicates a higher probability of lithium depletion for stars with planets in the main  sequence stage . </S>",
    "<S> it seems that stellar photospheric abundances of lithium in stars with planets may be somewhat affected by the presence of planets . </S>",
    "<S> two possible mechanisms are considered to account for the lower li abundances of stars with planets . </S>",
    "<S> one is related to the rotation - induced mixing due to the conservation of angular momentum by the protoplanetary disk , and the other is a shear instability triggered by planet migration . </S>",
    "<S> these results provide new information on stellar evolution and the lithium evolution of the galaxy . </S>"
