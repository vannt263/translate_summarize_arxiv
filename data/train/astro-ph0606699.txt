    "the observed universe contains order on all scales we can probe .",
    "it is generally believed that the largest structures arose via the amplification of primordial ( quantum ) fluctuations during a period of accelerated expansion , processed by the subsequent @xmath0gyrs of gravitational instability .",
    "the pattern of clustering of objects on large scales is a calculable prediction of cosmological models and thus comprises one of the fundamental cosmological statistics .    within modern theories of structure formation",
    ", the clustering of rare , massive dark matter halos is enhanced relative to that of the general mass distribution @xcite , an effect known as bias .",
    "the more massive the halo , the larger the bias . as a result ,",
    "the mass of halos hosting a given population of objects is sometimes inferred by measuring their degree of clustering  allowing a statistical route to the notoriously difficult problem of measuring masses of cosmological objects ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    since halos of a given mass can differ in their formation history and large - scale environmentmpc . ]",
    ", a natural question arises : do these details affect halo clustering ? in currently viable scenarios for structure formation , objects grow either by accretion of smaller units or by major mergers with comparable - sized objects .",
    "the formation history of a halo can thus be characterized by its mass accumulation over time , such as when it reached half of its mass , had a mass jump in a short time , or last underwent a ( major ) merger .    theoretically , the simplest descriptions of halo growth and clustering @xcite do not give a dependence upon halo formation history @xcite . to reprise these arguments : pick a random point in the universe and imagine filtering the density field around it on a sequence of successively smaller scales .",
    "the enclosed density executes a random walk , which in the usual prescription is taken to be uncorrelated from scale to scale .",
    "the formation of a halo of a given mass corresponds to the path passing a certain critical value of the density , @xmath1 , at a given scale .",
    "the bias of the halo is the ` past ' of its random walk and its history the ` future ' of the walk .",
    "all halos of the same mass at that time correspond to random walks crossing the same point , and thus have the same bias .",
    "( note that the derivation , using sharp @xmath2-space filtering , does not match the way the prescription is usually applied , and this has been suggested by some of the above authors as a way to obtain history dependence .",
    "introducing an environmental dependence through e.g.  elliptical collapse will also give a history dependence . )",
    "the lack of dependence on halo history in the simplest descriptions does not close the discussion theoretically or otherwise .",
    "while these analytic methods work much better than might be expected given their starting assumptions , the press - schechter based approaches still suffer many known difficulties ( e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "other analytical ways of estimating the clustering of mergers have been explored .",
    "for example , @xcite defined a merger kernel ( not calculable from first principles ) and assumed that all peaks within a certain volume eventually merged .",
    "such an ansatz implies that recently merged halos are more clustered for @xmath3 and less clustered for @xmath4 , with some dependence upon predecessor mass ratios and redshifts .",
    "( here @xmath5 is the mass at which @xmath6 , the variance of the linear power spectrum smoothed on scale @xmath7 , equals the threshold for linear density collapse @xmath8 , see e.g.  @xcite . ) using close pairs as a proxy for recently merged halos , they found a similar enhancement of clustering for @xmath3 and reduction for @xmath4 in several ( analytic ) clustering models . to foreshadow our results : the signals we see are consistent with this trend .",
    "simple analytic models can not be expected to capture all of the complexities of halo formation in hierarchical models , and full numerical simulations are required to validate and calibrate the fits .",
    "fortunately , numerical simulations are now able to produce samples with sufficient statistics to test for the dependence of clustering on formation history . early work by @xcite showed that the properties of dark matter halos , in particular formation times , are little affected by their large - scale environment if the entire population of objects is averaged over .",
    "they interpreted this as evidence against formation history and environment affecting clustering .",
    "as emphasized by @xcite , however , this finding  plus the well known fact that the typical mass of halos depends on local density  implies that the clustering of halos of the same mass must also depend on formation time . using a marked correlation function",
    ", @xcite found that close pairs tend to have earlier formation times than more distant pairs , work which was extended and confirmed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that later forming , low - mass halos are less clustered than typical halos of the same mass at the present ; a possible explanation of this result was given by @xcite .",
    "@xcite found a similar dependence upon halo formation time , showing that the trend reversed for more massive halos and that the clustering depended on halo concentration .",
    "however , in order to probe to higher masses these authors assumed that the mass dependence was purely a function of the mass in units of the non - linear mass , then used earlier outputs to probe to higher values of this ratio . it should be noted that scaling quantities by @xmath9 gives a direct equality only if clustering is self - similar . since @xmath10 is not a power - law and @xmath11 , a check of this approximation , as is done here ,",
    "is crucial .",
    "these formation time dependencies are based on ( usually smooth ) fits to the accretion history of the halo . however , halo assembly histories are often punctuated by large jumps from major mergers that have dramatic effects on the halos .",
    "major mergers can be associated with a wide variety of phenomena , ranging from quasar activity @xcite and starbursts in galaxies @xcite to radio halos and relics in galaxy clusters ( see e.g.  @xcite for phenomena associated with galaxy cluster mergers ) .",
    "major mergers of galaxy clusters are the most energetic events in the universe .",
    "it follows that major merger phenomena can either provide signals of interest or can cause noise in selection functions that depend upon a merger - affected observable . if recently merged halos cluster differently from the general population ( merger bias ) , and this is unaccounted for , conclusions drawn about halos on the basis of their clustering would be suspect .",
    "the question of whether such merger bias exists remains unresolved , as previous work to identify a merger bias through n - body simulations and analytic methods yields mixed results @xcite .",
    "in this paper we consider the clustering of the most massive dark matter halos , measured from two large volume ( @xmath12gpc)@xmath13 n - body simulations described in  [ sec : sims ] .",
    "we concentrate on massive halos , as most previous simulations did not have the volume to effectively probe this end of the mass function , and furthermore , for the largest mass halos the correspondence between theory and observation is particularly clean .",
    "we first examine the long - term growth history of halos , calculating the `` assembly bias '' as a function of growth history in  [ sec : history ] , extending previous results mentioned above to higher masses .",
    "we then look to short - term history effects ( i.e. events ) , measuring the `` merger bias '' as a function of recent major merger activity or large mass gain in ",
    "[ sec : merger ] , where we find a weak , but statistically significant , signal for both cases .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to investigate the effects of formation history on clustering statistics we use two high resolution n - body simulations performed with independent codes : the hot code @xcite and the treepm code @xcite .",
    "both simulations evolved randomly generated , gaussian initial conditions for @xmath14 particles of mass @xmath15 from @xmath16 to the present , using the same @xmath17cdm cosmology ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) in a periodic , cubical box of side @xmath12gpc .",
    "for the hot simulation a plummer law with softening @xmath23kpc ( comoving ) was used .",
    "the treepm code used a spline softened force with the same plummer equivalent softening .",
    "the treepm data were dumped in steps of light crossings of @xmath24mpc ( comoving ) , producing 30 outputs from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "the hot data were dumped from @xmath27 ( lookback time of @xmath28gyr ) to @xmath26 in intervals of @xmath29gyr , with the last interval at @xmath26 reduced to @xmath30gyr .",
    "the outputs before @xmath27 had so few high mass halos that the statistics were not useful for the merger event calculations . for comparisons of",
    "how using light crossings vs. fixed time steps in gyrs changes merger ratios , see @xcite .",
    "the treepm simulations were used for the assembly histories and the hot simulations for the merger bias calculations  though the results from the two simulations were consistent so either could have been used in principle .    for each output",
    "we generate two catalogs of halos via the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite , using linking lengths @xmath31 and @xmath32 in units of the mean interparticle spacing .",
    "these groups correspond roughly to all particles above a density threshold @xmath33 , thus both linking lengths enclose primarily virialized material .",
    "henceforth halo masses are quoted as the sum of the particle masses within fof halos , thus a given halo s @xmath34 mass will be smaller than its @xmath31 mass ( see @xcite for more discussion ) .",
    "we consider halos with mass @xmath35 ( more than 500 particles ) ; at @xmath26 there are approximately @xmath36 such halos in each box for the @xmath34 catalog and @xmath37 for the @xmath31 catalog .",
    "the mass functions and merger statistics from the two simulations are consistent within poisson scatter .    given a child - parent relationship between halos at neighboring output times , construction of the merger tree",
    "is straightforward since we are tracking massive halos rather than e.g. subhalos .",
    "progenitors are defined as those halos at an earlier time which contributed at least half of their mass to a later ( child ) halo . of the approximately @xmath38 halos at @xmath26 we find only 14 for which our simple method fails . in these cases",
    "a `` fly - by '' collision of two halos gives rise to a halo at @xmath26 with no apparent progenitors .",
    "excluding these halos does not change our results . for the treepm run",
    ", we use all 30 outputs to construct the merger tree , which stored all of the halo information ( mass , velocity dispersion , position , etc . ) for each halo at each output .",
    "each node of the tree pointed to a linked list of its progenitors at the earlier time , enabling a traversal of the tree to find mass accretion histories and mergers .",
    "the hot run produced outputs for each time interval of child and parent halos .",
    "a basic measure of clustering is the two - point function , which in configuration space is the correlation function , @xmath39 . to compute @xmath39 we use the method of @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are data and random catalogs , respectively , and the angle brackets refer to counts within a shell of small width having radius @xmath43 .",
    "in computing @xmath44 and @xmath45 we use @xmath46 as many random as data points . to compute errors ,",
    "we divide the simulation volume into 8 octants and compute @xmath39 within each octant . since we probe scales much smaller than the octants , we treat them as uncorrelated volumes , and we quote the mean @xmath39 and error on the mean under this assumption .",
    "these errors tend to be @xmath47@xmath48 times larger than the more approximate @xmath49 error estimates used in some previous work .",
    "our goal is to test the dependence of the clustering of objects associated with some history dependent property .",
    "a relevant quantity for comparison is the ( mass dependent ) bias of the halos relative to the underlying dark matter , which we define as : @xmath50    analytically , the large - scale bias is related to a derivative of the halo mass function @xcite . for the sheth - tormen form of the mass function one",
    "finds @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this has been improved upon using the hubble volume simulations @xcite  see also @xcite for discussion of the bias defined through @xmath10 on similar scales .",
    "@xcite used fof halos with @xmath54 and found @xmath55^{0.15 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the subscripts on the mass @xmath7 indicate which overdensity threshold is being used to define the halo mass .",
    "we took @xmath56 and @xmath57 , calculating the conversion using the profile of @xcite assuming a concentration @xmath58 .",
    "the change in conversion factor was less than a percent for the range of concentrations of interest .",
    "see @xcite for more details , discussion and definitions .",
    "we show the bias @xmath59 at @xmath60mpc as a function of mass in fig .",
    "[ fig : hbias ] .",
    "the bias for halos with @xmath61 changed less than 5% on scales @xmath62mpc .",
    "we include the two bias fits given above for @xmath60mpc at @xmath26 .",
    "the @xcite fit was derived from a larger simulation volume ; fig .",
    "[ fig : hbias ] is included to illustrate the mass dependence of the global bias , to provide a comparison context for the sizes of the additional biases of concern in this paper .",
    "we now turn to estimates of bias effects due to the history of the halos .",
    "we begin by considering parameterizations of the formation history of halos which emphasize the global properties , i.e.  those related to the halo mass growth over a long period of time .",
    "we consider three parameterizations of halo histories which have previously been used with lower mass halos : @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "using these parameterizations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have shown that the clustering of halos of fixed mass is correlated with `` formation time '' , a result which has come to be termed assembly bias .",
    "the effect is strongest for smaller halos , and this has been the focus of earlier work . for the extremely massive halos that we consider halo identification is simpler , as none of our halos are subhalos .",
    "however , since massive halos are rarer , the statistics are poor even for a simulation volume as large as ours .",
    "the concentration , @xmath63 , is a parameter in an nfw fit to a halo density profile @xcite ; note that @xcite use @xmath66 where @xmath67 for our cosmology . at @xmath26 , @xmath68 . ] . we perform a least squares fit of the nfw functional form to the radial mass distribution of all the particles in the fof group , allowing @xmath63 and @xmath69 to vary simultaneously .",
    "this is in order to be similar to the procedure of @xcite to allow ready comparison .",
    "the concentration is expected to correlate with the time by which most of the halo formed ( earlier forming halos are more concentrated , see @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a weak dependence of concentration on halo mass .",
    "we have tried to minimize this effect by dividing out the average concentration for each mass ( calculated from the data ) to get a `` reduced '' concentration , which is essentially uncorrelated with mass ( correlation is less than 0.2% ) .    the second parameter encapsulating the formation history is @xmath64 , the scale factor at which a halo accumulates half of its final mass .",
    "we find @xmath64 by linearly interpolating between the two bracketing times .",
    "analytic properties of this definition have been studied in @xcite , and @xmath64 is often used as a proxy for formation epoch .",
    "the third parameter , @xmath70 , the formation scale factor , is also a formation time proxy .",
    "it is defined through a fit to the halo mass accretion history @xcite : @xmath71,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the mass of the halo at @xmath26 .",
    "we calculate this from the history by doing a least squares fit of @xmath73 against @xmath74 for all the @xmath74 steps .",
    "although this form does not fit the mass accretion history of massive halos particularly well due to their frequent mergers , the fit is well defined and , as will be shown below , @xmath70 nonetheless appears to be correlated with clustering .",
    "the correlations , see e.g.  @xcite . ] for many of the above parameters were presented in @xcite .",
    "some of these correlations have been compared in different combinations in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . except for @xcite ,",
    "these were for galaxy scale halos rather than galaxy cluster scale halos .",
    "the formation histories for low mass halos tend to be smoother and better fit to the form of @xcite , since they undergo fewer mergers than high mass halos at late times .",
    "wechsler and zhao give a formula for the concentration in terms of the formation time of @xcite ; our correlation coefficient is characterizing the scatter around any such correlation .",
    "for the current sample the strongest correlation ( @xmath75 ) is between the formation redshift , @xmath76 , and the half - mass redshift , @xmath77 , consistent with the 0.70 found by @xcite with a sample about 1/7 the size .",
    "the formation redshift , @xmath78 , and reduced concentration have a correlation of @xmath79 . the full concentration and @xmath80 have a correlation of @xmath81 .",
    "these correlations increase as the lower mass limit is decreased from @xmath82 to @xmath83 .    to highlight any effects of assembly bias",
    "we take the highest and lowest quartiles of the distribution of each of these three parameterization values and compare the resulting @xmath39 to that of the full sample ( similar to @xcite ) .",
    "we show examples for @xmath84 and @xmath85 in fig .",
    "[ fig : histcorr ] . for the higher mass halos we see a strong dependence of clustering on concentration .",
    "we see a similar , but noticeably smaller , dependence on @xmath70 , indicating that more recently formed objects cluster more strongly . as all of the objects we consider have @xmath3",
    ", our results are in line with the expectation of @xcite and the theoretical model of @xcite .",
    "specifically , this confirms the result found by @xcite at @xmath26 , without needing to make the approximation that @xmath86 .    the ratio of their correlation function at their top @xmath63 quartile to the total sample for halos @xmath87 was @xmath88",
    "this is larger than our ratio , which does nt reach 1.2 for any of the radii considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : histcorr ] , though it is well within our ( and their ) errors .",
    "this is mirrored for the lowest @xmath63 quartile where our effect is similarly reduced but within the errors .",
    "we are using reduced concentration , while they divide each halo s concentration by the average concentration in its mass bin , @xmath89 .",
    "for the lower mass sample a much weaker trend is seen ( e.g.  the ratios for the quartiles when selected on concentration barely reaches 10% ) , agreeing with the expectation that the signal decreases as @xmath90 . at fixed mass ,",
    "the trend of @xmath91 with @xmath63 is consistent with the fit of @xcite , but the trend is so weak relative to the noise that the result is of marginal significance .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found bias for @xmath3 based on @xmath92 , where both the lowest and highest quartiles of @xmath92 tended to be more clustered than the full sample .",
    "we see a hint of this as well , but the fluctuations are large .",
    "@xcite also found more dependence of clustering on @xmath92 ( their formation time ) than on concentration , once luminosity dependent bias was taken out .",
    "note that their luminosity dependence might include some of the history measured by concentration or @xmath92 and their focus was on galaxies populating the halos rather than the halos themselves .",
    "note also that even though @xmath78 and @xmath92 are correlated , the correlation is not strong enough so that bias in one implies bias in the other .",
    "the overlap of the upper and lower quartiles for these quantities for @xmath93 is 62% and 54% respectively .",
    "as the rest of the clusters differ , the overall biases can be quite different , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : histcorr ] .    another formation time related quantity , the redshift of last mass jump by 20% or more in a time step corresponding to the light crossing time of @xmath24mpc comoving , had correlations with @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "we found a small sign of bias in the correlation functions of its highest and lowest quartiles as well , leading us to expect a merger bias signal , as will be examined in ",
    "[ sec : merger ] .    in summary ,",
    "we confirm and extend previous results to lower redshift and higher mass for concentration dependent bias .",
    "we see a smaller signal for formation time bias , and we see very little ( if any ) signal for bias based on when halos reach half of their mass .",
    "bias in concentration and half - mass redshift have been seen in previous work for smaller masses at higher redshift ; our results show a smaller bias , but well within errors , at least for the concentration dependent bias .",
    "in the previous section we demonstrated the dependence of @xmath39 upon halo formation history , characterized by an average property such as the `` formation time '' . as halo assembly histories are punctuated by large jumps from major mergers , we can also ask whether the clustering of recently merged halos differs from that of the general population .",
    "although the concept of a major merger is intuitively easy to understand , there is no standard definition in the literature of `` merger '' or `` major merger '' ( these terms will be used interchangeably henceforth ) . in simulations , where the progenitors can be tracked and masses measured , major mergers can be defined in terms of masses of the progenitors and the final halo .",
    "we define progenitors as those halos at an earlier time which contributed at least half of their mass to a later halo at the time of interest .",
    "the three most common ways to define a halo merger are : ( 1 ) the mass ratio of the two largest progenitors , @xmath97 ( 2 ) the same ratio , but using the contributing mass of the two most mass - contributing progenitors , and ( 3 ) @xmath98 , the ratio of the current halo mass to the total mass of its largest progenitor at an earlier time .",
    "we also consider ( 4 ) @xmath99 , the ratio of the current halo mass to the largest contributed mass . in our simulations",
    "the merger fraction per @xmath29gyr with @xmath100 increases by more than a factor of 3 from @xmath26 to 1 .",
    "one way to quantify how well the two body criteria ( @xmath101 and @xmath102 ) describe the halo growth is to consider the ratio @xmath103 .",
    "this ratio is 1 for a halo formed only from its two largest predecessors : a two body merger with no other accretion .",
    "it is lowered by accretion or multi - body mergers .",
    "[ fig : mergedefs ] shows the cumulative distribution of @xmath103 for halos with @xmath104 satisfying a variety of merger criteria .",
    "we considered both cases where @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the full and contributing progenitor masses .",
    "as can be seen on the right , for all halos with @xmath107 at @xmath26 , considering mass gains within the last @xmath30gyr , at least 5% of the final halo mass is not from the two largest contributors .",
    "as the merger criteria is hardened ( i.e.  the merger is more `` major '' ) , the two largest progenitors contribute less and less of the final mass .",
    "as can be seen on the left , the same amount of mass as found in the two largest progenitors makes up the entire mass of the final halo in @xmath10825% of the full sample of halos . lengthening the time step or looking to higher",
    "redshift also increases the fraction of halos getting their mass from halos other than the two largest progenitors . for simplicity ,",
    "our subsequent analysis uses only the two body criteria to define mergers , so the accuracy of this assumption as examined above should be kept in mind .",
    "previous work to identify a merger bias through n - body simulations and analytic methods gives a mixed picture .",
    "@xcite found a clustering bias for recently ( @xmath109gyr ) merged objects with @xmath110 and @xmath111 at @xmath26 .",
    "these authors , however , did not try to match the mass distribution of the comparison sample to that of the merged halos  a problem since mergers occur more often for more massive halos , and the bias is known to increase with halo mass . to isolate the effects due to merging , the comparison sample needs to have the same mass distribution as the merged sample , and most subsequent work has ensured this .",
    "@xcite found no bias between the correlation functions of recently merged ( @xmath112yr , @xmath100 ) and general samples at @xmath113 for halos with @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "@xcite confirmed percival et al.s results for major mergers in a @xmath117 sample for a smaller range of masses , but surprisingly found an enhancement of clustering for halos with recent ( @xmath118 , @xmath119yr ) large total mass gain , @xmath120 .",
    "that is , they find a bias when selecting halos with a recent large mass gains , but not when selecting on recently merged halos parent masses .",
    "their signal was weak due to limited statistics .    that the previous literature is inconclusive",
    "is to be expected , given that the effects of merger history upon clustering are small , and extremely difficult to measure numerically .",
    "we expect the largest signal when @xmath121 , but this is where the number density of objects is smallest .",
    "in addition , the most extreme mergers are the rarest , increasing the shot - noise in the measurement of @xmath39 .",
    "if we include more common events , the `` merged '' and `` comparison '' samples become more similar , washing out the signal of interest . at",
    "higher redshift , the merger rate increases , thus the merged and comparison samples have more overlap unless the merger ratio is increased , leading to worse statistics .",
    "to try to overcome these statistical effects , we use our very large samples of simulated halos to search for a merger , or temporal , bias .    to define a `` recent major merger '' requires both a choice of threshold for one of the merger ratios and a choice of time interval . as we expect the halo crossing time to be @xmath122gyr , ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ", we expect that outputs at this separation or shorter are small enough to catch recently merged halos while they are still `` unrelaxed '' .",
    "that is , a `` recent merger '' might be expected to correspond to a dynamically disturbed halo .",
    "we consider the four merger criteria mentioned above , as well as a wide range of samples and merger definitions .",
    "we used 9 different time intervals from @xmath123 to @xmath26 as given in  [ sec : sims ] .",
    "we considered 4 different thresholds for both @xmath124 and @xmath98 using both total and contributing mass of the progenitors : @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "furthermore , we used two minimum masses , @xmath127 , @xmath82 , and two fof linking lengths , @xmath128 .",
    "combinations of each of these criteria resulted in over 700 different pairs of `` merged '' and `` comparison '' samples .",
    "although this data set is very rich , systematic trends are difficult to identify .",
    "this is in part because increasing the merger `` strength '' simultaneously increases the noise ( due to lower numbers of events ) .",
    "evidence of bias is very slight in the binned @xmath39 .",
    "we used three methods to try to isolate the signal : the marked correlation function , the integrated correlation function , and a likelihood fit to a power law for the correlation function .",
    "the clustering and merger criteria influence these three quantities in distinct ways .",
    "we now describe each method , and our corresponding results , in turn .",
    "one problem with computing merger effects in terms of @xmath39 is that , to compute the difference in clustering of merged and random samples , one must define a boolean merger criterion  a halo is either in the merged sample or not . as halo histories",
    "are complex , a more nuanced measure of merger clustering is useful , and this can be provided by using the marked correlation function @xcite . each of @xmath129 objects gets assigned a mark , @xmath130 , for @xmath131 .",
    "denoting the separation of the pair @xmath132 by @xmath133 , the marked correlation function , @xmath134 , is defined by @xmath135 where the sum is over all pairs of objects @xmath132 with separation @xmath136 , @xmath137 is the number of pairs , and the mean mark , @xmath138 , is calculated over all objects in the sample .",
    "the marked correlation function `` divides '' out the clustering of the average sample , and thus a difference in clustering is detected for @xmath139 .",
    "we consider five marks : @xmath124 ( for both total and contributed masses ) , @xmath98 , @xmath140 ( where @xmath105 is contributed mass ) and @xmath141 .",
    "the last case had a smaller range of marks , and thus tests sensitivity to extreme events .",
    "the results for this mark were similar to the others , suggesting that we are not dominated by outliers .",
    "halos are chosen with mass in a narrow range , @xmath142 , to minimize the previously mentioned bias due to merged halos being more massive .",
    "the global bias changes less than a percent over the mass ranges we consider .    in our combined sample of several output times and mass ranges",
    ", the largest signal comes from using as mark the maximum value of @xmath124 within @xmath143 of the present , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mark2 ] .",
    "as @xmath143 was increased the signal went smoothly to zero .",
    "we find similar behavior for @xmath144 , which suggests that any bias is contributed by the systems where @xmath145 .",
    "the signal is extremely weak for the other marks we considered . by stacking the signal across multiple output times ( see  [ sec : lik ] for details ) we are able to find small , but statistically significant detections of excess power for the marks @xmath124 , @xmath144 , and @xmath98 , for halos near @xmath146 . at higher masses",
    "there is weak evidence for an effect , but the large error bars weaken the statistical significance .",
    "as the marked correlation function approach finds only a weak signal , typically an enhanced clustering of order 510% , we also explore two indicators which characterize the correlations by fewer parameters : the integrated correlation function observed at a single scale , and a likelihood fit to a power law correlation function .",
    "given an object at some position , the integrated correlation function @xmath147 is the probability , above random , that a second object will be within a sphere of radius @xmath43 .",
    "this quantity enhances any increased clustering at short distances , but gives error bars that are even more highly correlated than those of the correlation function , @xmath39 , itself .",
    "a typical result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xibars ] , where a significant signal can be seen . as in the previous section ,",
    "we find a weak signal regardless of merger definition in our 700 plus samples .",
    "considering all the samples and all the separations @xmath43 , more than @xmath148 of the time the difference @xmath149 was positive .",
    "this method separates the data into radial bins , requiring us to estimate the clustering at many locations . since the errors on the binned correlation points",
    "are highly correlated , we reduced @xmath150 to a single measurement by fixing a preferred scale .",
    "the signal tends to be largest near @xmath151mpc ( though the signal is largest at @xmath152mpc in the examples in fig .  [",
    "fig : xibars ] ) , and so we compare @xmath150 of the merged and general samples at this radius . on average , when a @xmath153 signal is seen ( 515% of the time , depending on mass ratio , etc . ) , @xmath150 for the mergers is @xmath10820% higher than for the general sample , although in extreme cases the difference can be as large as a factor of 2 or 3 .",
    "due to the noisy statistics it was hard to identify any clear trends .",
    "the integrated correlation function sums all pairs within a spherical region . as an alternate approach ,",
    "we approximate the correlation function as a power law over some range of radii , and we perform a likelihood fit to this power law correlation function : @xmath155 over the range of scales @xmath156 .",
    "this method incorporates information from many scales , similar to the integrated correlation function .",
    "however , it is combined with the expectation that the correlation function should be a power law and excises the center region . by using the positions of the halos directly in the fit to the likelihood ,",
    "the errors differ from those in the integrated correlation function as well .",

    "] , and @xmath39 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : xipl ] ) .",
    "we fit over the range @xmath162@xmath163mpc , where the correlation function exhibits an approximately power law behavior .",
    "for the comparison sample we multiply the likelihoods for several different realizations , to reduce the noise , and then renormalize to unit area . a typical result , where a significant signal can be seen , is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : maxl ] , demonstrating both the power law fit and the maximum likelihood distribution . for the fits ,",
    "@xmath154 was usually @xmath164mpc , within the range where the power law fit was being applied .    across all of our samples ,",
    "we find @xmath165 .",
    "to allow us to compare different samples more easily , we reduce the number of free parameters to one by holding @xmath166 . a typical example , demonstrating the ratio of the power law fit correlation functions of the merged and general sample , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : biasevol ] as a function of lookback time / redshift . since we fix @xmath167 for both the merged and general sample , the ratio @xmath168 using eq .",
    "( [ eqn : xipl ] ) is scale - invariant within our fit range . while the enhanced clustering of the recently merged sample is small , it remains statistically significant .",
    "typically , the merged sample shows an enhanced clustering of @xmath169 in the correlation function for the @xmath29gyr spacings , though we find no strong evidence of systematic bias evolution with redshift .",
    "moreover , at @xmath26 , where the spacing is smaller ( @xmath30gyr ) , we find a significantly enhanced @xmath39 for the mergers , often @xmath170 . presumably , this increased clustering signal is caused by the smaller time interval .",
    "larger intervals encompass more mergers , leading to smaller errors , but also leading to a smaller signal , since mergers now encompass a more significant fraction of the comparison population . as mentioned above , looking at earlier times",
    "also makes the merged and comparison population overlap increase dramatically .    by averaging @xmath168 across all of the @xmath29gyr spacings from @xmath27 to @xmath171",
    ", we are able to study the size of the merger bias simply as a function of merger ratio .",
    "figure [ fig : mratio ] shows the increase of @xmath168 with @xmath124 ( full mass ) and @xmath98 both for mergers within @xmath30gyr of the present and for the redshift - averaged @xmath29gyr spacings .",
    "the merger bias clearly increases with increasing merger ratio , with the smaller time step yielding stronger clustering as described above .    in summary , we find a weak bias in many cases ( but not all  the signals are very noisy ) for recent major mergers and recent large mass gains .",
    "while @xcite found no such merger bias , our signal is consistent with their upper limit of @xmath172 on the bias effects of recent mergers .",
    "the work of @xcite saw a small bias for large mass gains but noted that their statistics limited their ability to determine the significance .",
    "our larger box allowed us to incorporate the effects of cosmic variance , which had been neglected in previous work .",
    "cosmic variance increased the errors by 40% or more , which limited the significance of the signal .",
    "nonetheless , we still found a small bias for _ both _ mergers and large mass gains .",
    "the large - scale structure of the universe is built upon a skeleton of clustered dark matter halos . for the past two decades",
    "we have known that rarer , more massive dark matter halos cluster more strongly than their lower mass counterparts .",
    "halos of a fixed mass , however , can differ in their formation history and large - scale environment , and recent work on halos smaller than galaxy clusters has shown that this can lead to further changes in their clustering .    in this paper",
    "we have used two large - volume , high resolution n - body simulations to study the clustering of massive halos as a function of formation history .",
    "we confirmed earlier results that the lower concentration massive halos are more clustered than the population as a whole ; extending these results to higher masses ( and thus lower redshifts ) than had been probed previously @xcite .",
    "( previous work had looked at similar regimes of @xmath9 but for smaller @xmath7 and thus higher redshift ; note again that exact scaling with @xmath9 is not expected for non power law @xmath10 and @xmath173 . ) similarly , we confirmed the enhanced clustering of halos with later formation times , though the signal was not as strong as for concentration .",
    "the signal for bias based on a halo reaching half of its mass is weaker than that seen in @xcite ( again for higher @xmath174 ) , and not statistically significant in our case .",
    "we also investigated whether recent merger activity affected the clustering of massive halos  a topic with a muddied history in the literature . while we found statistically significant ( @xmath175 ) merger effects on clustering in many cases we considered , both for recent major mergers and large mass gain , in most cases this signal was weak : a 510% increase in bias .",
    "our strongest signal came from using a likelihood fit of the correlation function to a power law , particularly for major mergers within @xmath30gyr of the present , where we saw a typical merger bias of up to @xmath172 .",
    "this bias signal is not necessarily at odds with the lack of signal in previous work , which looked for larger bias than that seen on average here .",
    "even with a @xmath176 volume , massive halos remain very rare objects and small changes in their correlations are difficult to detect .",
    "we were plagued by the competing effects that increasing the severity of the merger ( and hence underlying signal ) decreases the number of pairs , worsening the statistics .",
    "general trends remain elusive , since changing various criteria ( e.g.  merger definition , minimum mass , time step ) generally changed the number of halos involved , thus changing the errors .",
    "however , we did find that the strength of the merger bias typically increased with increasing merger ratio , i.e.  more major mergers are more strongly biased .",
    "finally , we note that the correlations found between the last large ( 20% ) mass gain and the different definitions of formation redshifts provide a connection between the assembly bias studied in  [ sec : history ] and the merger bias in  [ sec : merger ] . this bias is not expected from direct application of extended press - schechter theory , and it provides a phenomenon that a more precise analytic model of mergers should reproduce .",
