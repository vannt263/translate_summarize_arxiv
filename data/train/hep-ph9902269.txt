    "<S> we compute the effective magnetic moment of neutrino in the highly dense and strongly magnetized media . it is shown that this magnetic moment is generated due to the effective mass of neutrino and gives sufficiently high value of the magnetic moment in the core of neutron stars .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of the effects of intense magnetic fields on various astrophysical phenomenon has got a considerable importance nowadays . </S>",

    "<S> the dispersion curves for neutrinos propagating in such an extremely dense plasmas in the strong magnetic fields of order @xmath2 has already been calculated @xcite . by starting form the standard model neutrinos we have shown that these neutrinos while propagating through a very dense electroweak plasma in the presence of a very strong magnetic field ( @xmath3 ) acquire large effective mass @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> these effectively massive neutrinos exhibit a large effective magnetic moment while passing through this highly magnetized medium . </S>",
    "<S> the effective magnetic dipole moment describes the neutrino energy shift in a magnetized medium as a consequence of the @xmath5-structure of the self - energy which is not that of a magnetic dipole interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we work in the framework of imaginary time formalism and replace the vacuum propagators with the corresponding background corrected propagators in presence of the strong magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> all the feynman rules of the vacuum theory remain the same , otherwise . </S>",

    "<S> the expression ( 6 ) is valid whenever @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> this dirac type effective mass of neutrinos can couple in the medium with the external magnetic field through real electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding value of the magnetic dipole moment of neutrino can then be evaluated as @xmath41    which come out to be equal to    @xmath42    giving @xmath43 for @xmath0 @xmath1 inside the neutron stars . </S>",
    "<S> notice also that when the magnetic field ( locally ) rises to @xmath44 @xmath1 the corresponding magnetic moment increases to @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note in eq.([dip1 ] ) that the magnetic moment of neutrino becomes a function of the magnetic field due to the @xmath4 dependence on @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> it is different from the dipole magnetic moment correction due to statistical background @xcite for massive neutrinos which always appear as a coefficient of the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it can also be seen from eq.([dip1 ] ) that if we expand this equation for small values of @xmath47 , we still get a nonzero value of the effective dipole moment @xmath48 which is generated due to the effectively massive neutrinos . it can also be seen from fig.1 that the magnetic moment of neutrinos at @xmath49 @xmath1 correspond to this constant value </S>",
    "<S> .    this low @xmath46 value of the magnetic moment will only be significant at large electron densities @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour of @xmath51 as a function of @xmath46 has been plotted in fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen from this plot that for very strong fields the magnetic moment changes rapidly with the field , so the dependence of @xmath51 with regards to @xmath46 becomes stronger with the increasing magnetic field .    from fig.1 and also directly from eq.([dip1 ] ) it seems that the magnetic dipole moment of neutrino has a pole at @xmath52 @xmath1 which is the required primordial background field to galactic dynamo effect and is needed to produce electroweak phase transition on the scale of one correlation length @xmath53 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> however this singularity is only apparent , since for @xmath54 , the approximation on which ( 6 ) is based , ceases to be valid . also for fields extremely near @xmath55 the production of pairs @xmath56 in the ground state </S>",
    "<S> is increased , a @xmath57 condensate appears which modifies eq.([dip1 ] ) and as a result @xmath4 does not actually diverge @xcite . </S>"
