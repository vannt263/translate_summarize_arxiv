    "in the calculation of feynman amplitude with massless particles , one has to regulate infrared divergences ( ir ) , which cancel out among loop corrections and real emission processes . in perturbative qcd , this divergences are regulated by @xmath0-dimensional method .",
    "divergent part is expressed as poles in terms of @xmath1 .",
    "sector decomposition method developed in refs .",
    "@xcite are widely used for separating ir divergences .    as a simple example of separation of infrared divergences ,",
    "let us consider the following one - dimensional integral for @xmath2 with a regular function @xmath3 such that @xmath4 is a non - zero finite value : @xmath5 when @xmath6 , the factor @xmath7 produces a logarithmic divergence by the integration around @xmath8 . while for @xmath2 , the divergence is regularized and converted to a pole of @xmath9 .",
    "the coefficient of the pole is @xmath4 , which is the first term of the taylor expansion of @xmath10 around @xmath11 .",
    "the rest of the integration becomes finite for @xmath12 .",
    "this example shows that , when the singular part of the integrand is factored out , one can separate divergent part as poles in terms of @xmath9 .    for the general loop integrations , it will also be possible to separate ir divergence , if the singular part is factored out .",
    "although the factorization of a multi - variate polynomial is not a trivial problem , it is solved by the method of sector decomposition .",
    "this method shows that when the integration domain is properly decomposed into sectors and selecting good variables in each sector , the divergent part is factored out .",
    "this method provides at the same time a practical procedure to find such sectors and variables .",
    "then we can obtain the coefficients of the poles of @xmath9 and the finite part as a laurent series in terms of @xmath9 .",
    "usual sector decomposition method divides the integration domain and find appropriate new variables by an iterative way .",
    "it was found that a simple iterative method may fall into an infinite loop and _ strategies _ are proposed to avoid this problem by refs .",
    "other strategies have been proposed and a practical system has been constructed by refs .  @xcite .",
    "since one has to calculate integration for each sector , a method is preferable when it produces less number of sectors .",
    "we propose another method based on the classification of asymptotic behavior of polynomials around the origin .",
    "the problem is converted to one for convex bodies in euclidean space and solved with algorithms developed in computational geometry .",
    "these are deterministic algorithms without iterations .",
    "this talk presents , based on ref .",
    "@xcite , our basic ideas and show the results of this method .",
    "the procedure of sector decomposition consists of the following steps :    1 .",
    "start from feynman parameter representation of a loop integration .",
    "primary sector decomposition : + the @xmath13-function is integrated and the integration domain is decomposed such that the singularities appear in the specific position in each sector .",
    "factorization of the integrand : + the sectors obtained in the previous step are decomposed into finer ones .",
    "new variables are found such that singular parts are factored out .",
    "4 .   separation of poles in terms of @xmath9 : + the regular part of the integrand is expanded in terms of @xmath9 .",
    "the coefficients of laurent series in terms of @xmath9 are obtained .",
    "5 .   integration of coefficients : + the coefficients are now free from ir divergences .",
    "however , they will still include multi - dimensional integration .",
    "they will be integrated out by analytic or numerical methods .",
    "in ( a ) is mapped to a square shown by ( b ) .",
    "[ fig : psd ] , width=302 ]    feynman parameter representation of a loop integration includes @xmath13-function which defines the @xmath14-dimensional hyperplane .",
    "the primary sector decomposition integrates over one of integration variables and decompose the integration domain into @xmath15 sectors .",
    "an example is shown by fig .  [ fig : psd ] for the 3-dimensional case . by the decomposition of the integration domain and selecting new variables , sectors become @xmath14-dimensional cubes .",
    "the original boundary of the integration domain is mapped to a part of the new boundary specified by conditions that some of new variables are 0 .",
    "the resulting expression of the integration for @xmath16-th sector becomes : @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are polynomials of variables @xmath20 .",
    "parameter @xmath21 is integer determined by the power of propagators , and @xmath22 is an @xmath14-dimensional vector whose elements are all 1 .",
    "powers @xmath23 and @xmath24 are functions of @xmath9 . if @xmath18 or @xmath19 become 0 at the boundary , and corresponding power @xmath23 or @xmath24 becomes negative integer for @xmath6 , the integration diverges .",
    "we want to express polynomial @xmath18 in the form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a set of new variable , @xmath27 is a polynomial of @xmath26 , @xmath28 is an integer vector and @xmath29 is a constant . in order to seek such an expression ,",
    "we consider the following example taken from one - loop box integration : @xmath30 if terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 when @xmath33 , the asymptotic behavior of @xmath34 is determined by the term @xmath35 .",
    "the singular behavior of the integrand around the origin is determined by this term .",
    "this condition is satisfied by taking new variables @xmath26 defined by @xmath36 . with the range of @xmath37",
    "being limited to @xmath38 , a sub - domain of the integration domain in @xmath20-space is obtained .",
    "this example shows that a term of a polynomial in some sub - domain will determine asymptotic behavior of the polynomial around the origin .",
    "we call this term _ dominant _ in this sub - domain .    in order to see dominant terms more closely around the origin ,",
    "let us change variable to @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "monomial @xmath41 becomes @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the inner product defined in @xmath14-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "this shows that a monomial corresponds one - to - one to a integer vector @xmath44 in this euclidean space ( let us call this _ power vector _ ) .",
    "let @xmath45 is the set of power vectors corresponding to the terms included in a polynomial @xmath34 .",
    "polynomial @xmath34 is expressed by : @xmath46 in order to find the dominant term , let us consider a limit @xmath47 for @xmath48 with a fixed non - negative real vector @xmath49 .",
    "a term @xmath50 is dominant in this limit when @xmath51 for all @xmath52 .",
    "conversely , let us fix vector @xmath53 and vary @xmath49 or @xmath54 .",
    "the term with this power vector @xmath53 is dominant in the sub - domain defined by : @xmath55 this sub - domain forms a convex polyhedral cone .",
    "the polynomial @xmath34 is expressed as the following : @xmath56 .\\ ] ] for a vector @xmath57 , factor @xmath58 for @xmath59 , since @xmath60 holds for all @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that the term @xmath61 is dominant in the sub - domain @xmath62 .",
    "thus , asymptotic behavior of @xmath34 is classified in terms of these sub - domains @xmath63 .     ,",
    "width=226 ]    when this method is applied also to @xmath64 , the singular parts are factored out from the integration .",
    "let us return to our example eq .",

    "@xmath64 is @xmath65 and this expression shows that @xmath64 does not produce ir singularity ( @xmath66 for @xmath67 ) . with a simple calculation ,",
    "we obtain from eq .",
    "( [ olbex ] ) : @xmath68 the sub - domains are shown in fig .  [",

    "the fact that the last sub - domain is empty means that term @xmath69 never becomes dominant .",
    "the second domain is a triangular cone for which variables @xmath70 take simple range of values .",
    "however , the first sub - domain includes four parameters in 3-dimensional space .",
    "when this sub - domain is divided further into two triangular cones , this redundancy disappears : @xmath71 now we subsequently change variable from @xmath72 to @xmath73 and then to @xmath74 .",
    "the integration domain for @xmath26 becomes 3-dimensional unit cube .",
    "finally we obtain a sector decomposition as the following : @xmath75 it is easy to calculate jacobian , which is found to be a monomial of @xmath26 .    for the general case , the decomposition of the integration domain in accordance with the classification of the asymptotic behavior , corresponding to eqs .",
