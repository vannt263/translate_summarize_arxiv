    "the conduction properties of low - dimensional electron and hole systems with the disorder of different origin have long been the subject of active research .",
    "investigations into such objects of mesoscopic size have currently become particularly intensive in view of their applied importance ( semiconductor heterostructures , quantum dot devices , etc . ) , on the one hand , and due to the intriguing uncommonness of the obtained results , on the other .",
    "the most puzzling phenomenon which has not as yet been understood in full measure is the transition of 2d electron systems from conducting to insulating state ( the extensive bibliography on the subject can be found in refs .",
    "observation of this phenomenon evidently contradicts the common view stemming from the well - known scaling theory of localization  @xcite .",
    "a diversity of ideas have been put forward to explain the `` anomalous '' metallic behaviour of 2d systems at extremely low temperatures . among physical mechanisms assumed to be responsible for such behaviour",
    "the most appropriate is the coulomb ( @xmath0-@xmath0 ) interaction of carriers .",
    "the assumption is mainly based on the fact that the dimensionless parameter @xmath1 ( the ratio of interaction energy to fermi energy of electrons ) which characterizes this interaction amounts to the value of @xmath2 in planar systems of si mosfet - type as well as in gaas / algaas heterostructures , which would suffice to raise serious doubts about the adequacy of fermi - liquid approach with regard to such systems .    note",
    "that in condensed matter physics an important paradigm is the quasi - particle notion .",
    "a  number of phenomena can be understood in terms of weakly interacting quasi - particles , although coulomb interaction between the electrons is rather strong .",
    "the fermi liquid description of quasi - particles has for a long time been considered to be efficient in low dimensions in the presence of disorder @xcite until recent experiments have challenged this view @xcite .",
    "serious problems have also arisen when interpreting numerous experimental data on decoherence time saturation at low temperature , reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as explaning unexpectedly large persistent currents in normal metals  @xcite .    at this stage ,",
    "the lack of a comprehensive theory for strongly correlated electrons does not allow for certain conclusions to be made about the role of @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction in the detected phenomena . since in different existing theories this interaction is evaluated quite differently , viz . from promoting localization @xcite to preventing its appearance @xcite",
    ", it would be quite reasonable at first to describe the observed effects in frames of one - particle approach and then to regard coulomb interaction as the added dephasing factor . only should one fail in obtaining the proper result on this canonical way",
    "may it be rational to think of coulomb correlations as a prevalent cause of forming the  continuous component in the electron spectrum of 2d systems .",
    "previously @xcite , the one - particle theory capable of explaining the conducting ground state of weakly disordered finite - size 2d systems was developed in terms of electron states pertinent to open quantum wells of waveguide configuration . according to this theory",
    ", the conductance must exhibit non - exponential coordinate dependence at any length of the system provided that there exists more than one extended mode of transverse quantization ( so called waveguide mode ) , commonly referred to as the open conducting channel  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was proven that scattering by static random potential , even though it is of elastic nature from the viewpoint of one - electron dynamics , may well result in dephasing the initially coherent extended _ collective _ modes .",
    "this leads to the reduction in the primordially finite - value ballistic conductance rather than it grows from the `` localized '' exponentially small value .",
    "the primordial conductance is quantized in steps , each being equal to the conductance quantum @xmath3 , regardless of the length of the bounded 2d system of carriers .",
    "inclusion of imperfections allowing for scattering between different extended waveguide modes results in the conductance decrease from ballistic to diffusive value .",
    "the expression for the diffusive conductance tends asymptotically to the standard drude form if the quantum waveguide is sufficiently wide .",
    "the above scenario of the conducting state of a real 2d electron system is evidently opposite to the one stemming from well - known scaling theory , in which the metallic behaviour of the conductance can only result from some kind of dephasing of the electron states initially localized by disorder .    using the approach taken in ref .",
    "@xcite , in ref .",
    "@xcite one - particle theory of the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) in 2d systems was developed .",
    "this theory provides a deeper insight into the peculiarities of the effect observed experimentally . according to @xcite , ( i ) mit detected in si - mosfets as well as in structures of gaas / algaas - type",
    "should be regarded as a true quantum phase transition which takes place both in disordered and perfect systems ; ( ii )  straight from the metallic side of the transition the conductance reaches the value equal , by the order of magnitude , to the standard conductance quantum ( theoretically , in the limit of an ideally perfect system , the conductance jumps exactly by @xmath4 as the last conducting channel is closed ) .",
    "the results @xcite were obtained in the fermi - liquid description of the electron system , without taking explicitly into account coulomb interaction of carriers as well as spin effects . meanwhile , the very fact that the _ extended _ waveguide modes were used as the initial quasi - particles ( which have unlimited spatial extent , in contrast to anderson - localized states ) permits hoping that the results of refs .",
    "@xcite will hold true , at least qualitatively , even on condition that coulomb correlations are also taken into account .    although the model of 2d mit suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite correlate well with the main experimental facts , it does not seem to be rather convincing to make far - reaching conclusions . the problem of great concern , which has not been touched upon in @xcite and has not been so far explained theoretically is the unusual nature of the strong localizing effect produced by the relatively weak in - plane magnetic field . normally , the magnetic field is known to suppress the conductance of bulk metallic samples due to coupling to the orbital motion of electrons .",
    "however , if the field is applied parallel to a confined system whose actual thickness is small as compared to the magnetic length , it is natural to expect the orbital effect to be highly suppressed .",
    "only corrections from @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction of carriers are retained in the case of spinless electrons  @xcite .    with this prevailing point of view",
    ", it came as a surprise when dramatic suppression of conductivity was observed in si - mosfets subjected to the in - plane magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "the effect of this field was found to be so significant that it causes the zero - field 2d metal to become an insulator @xcite .",
    "inasmuch as magnetic fields appropriate for such a transition are strong enough to completely polarize electron spins , this prompted many of the researchers ( see , e.  g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) to assert categorically that it is exactly the spin polarization that should be regarded as a physical origin of 2d mit in a parallel magnetic field .",
    "this point of view is also supported by the lack of a comprehensive theory of the electron transport in real quasi - two - dimensional ( q2d ) systems , i.  e. planar systems of finite , though rather small , thickness .",
    "although in some papers ( e.  g. , @xcite ) the orbital effect of an in - plane magnetic field was , in a way , analyzed as well , the results are still not rated as fully convincing .",
    "this is probably concerned , on the one hand , with the fact that the relatively simple model proposed in @xcite is incapable of explaining a quite abrupt transition over the magnetic field between metallic and dielectric regimes .",
    "on the other hand , the results obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite only exhibit the trend in behaviour of the q2d system conductance with a growth in the magnetic field , since the applied calculation method enables one to analyze only weak - localization _ corrections _ in the metallic phase , thus being incapable of capturing the  coarse effect such as mit .    in this paper , the orbital effect of in - plane magnetic field upon open quasi-2d electron systems of waveguide configuration",
    "is investigated using the theoretic - field method previously employed in refs .",
    "the advantage of the approach is that it enables one to take into account in a similar fashion all the one - electron states , without distinguishing them by the kind of trajectories , which in q2d case can be either of sliding type ( levi flights ) or those frequently scattered at side boundaries of the system .",
    "although the method is widely applicable , here we will examine thoroughly the specific case of weak electron - impurity scattering and weak magnetic fields ( the appropriate criteria are listed below ) .",
    "the notion of weak magnetic field implies the certain relationship between geometric parameters of the electron waveguide and the classical cyclotron radius of electron trajectories . at the same time ,",
    "in general it does not imply low mixing of the electron states .",
    "the magnetic - field - induced mode entanglement may be rather strong , but it does not give rise to noticeable dephasing of the transverse - quantized states unless there exists some random short - correlated potential as well .",
    "the most important effect of the magnetic field is that it influences significantly the mode content of the electron spectrum , thereby resulting in noticeable change in the number of current - carrying modes and in spectral width of their energy levels . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was proven that the number of conducting channels becomes smaller when the magnetic field increases , being simultaneously accompanied by the gain in coherence of the electron states .",
    "it is just the reduction in the number of extended modes that can be viewed as the physical origin of the transition of q2d electron system from conducting to insulating state .    to justify the sensitivity of the mode state spectrum as the major cause of the observed mit it is necessary to trace the spectrum peculiarities in terms of the observable quantity , say , the conductance . to accomplish this task",
    ", it would be inconvenient to use the landauer approach , since it does not look into the coherence properties of the _ internal _ spectrum of the system in question , operating it as a scattering object integrally .",
    "therefore , in this study we apply the linear response theory @xcite which permits us to calculate the conductance on a microscopic level .",
    "two - dimensional electron and hole systems in use , in view of their open property in the direction of current and the resemblance of master equation to that of the classical wave theory , can be simulated as planar quantum waveguides whose transverse design is governed by the lateral confinement potentials . although near - surface potential wells in si mosfets and gaas / algaas heterostructures are close in shape to triangular or parabolic form @xcite , this fact is of minor importance for its principal application which is to restrict electron transport in the direction normal to heterophase areas , thus resulting in _ transverse _ quantization of the electron spectrum . with this consideration in mind ,",
    "we assume , to simplify calculations , the q2d system of carriers to have the form of three - dimensional planar `` electron waveguide '' of rectangular cross - section ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , which occupies the coordinate region @xmath5\\ , \\label{geom}\\\\   & z\\in[-h/2,h/2 ] \\ .\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the length @xmath6 , the width @xmath7 , and the height @xmath8 of the waveguide will be regarded as arbitrary , within the restrictions imposed below .",
    "[ .7],title=\"fig : \" ]    in practice the change of a quantum waveguide thickness implies alteration of the width of the near - surface potential well and , as a consequence , of sheet density of the carriers .",
    "inasmuch as this density is known to follow the variation in depletion voltage under the simple law @xcite , the results obtained below as a function of a waveguide thickness can be easily related to the experiment .",
    "we will examine the @xmath9 magnetoresistance of a q2d electron system by expressing the dimensionless ( in units of @xmath10 ) conductance @xmath11 in terms of one - particle propagators .",
    "assuming the system of units with @xmath12 ( @xmath13  is the electron effective mass ) , the static conductance is given by @xmath14    \\left[g_{\\varepsilon_f}^a(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')-    g_{\\varepsilon_f}^r(\\mathbf{r},\\mathbf{r}')\\right]\\\\    \\label{kubo_cond }     \\times & \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\,x'}-\\frac{ie}{\\hbar c}a_x(\\mathbf{r}')\\right ]    \\left[g_{\\varepsilon_f}^a(\\mathbf{r}',\\mathbf{r})-    g_{\\varepsilon_f}^r(\\mathbf{r}',\\mathbf{r})\\right]\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the retarded ( advanced ) green function of the electrons of fermi energy  @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the @xmath18-th component of the external vector potential @xmath19 .",
    "integration in is performed over the region occupied by the quantum waveguide , spin degeneracy is taken into account by the factor of 2 .",
    "note that throughout this paper the fermi energy ( or the chemical potential , as the situation requires ) will be considered to have a constant value , independently of the confinement potential .",
    "this is undoubtedly true on the metallic side of the mit discussed below .",
    "moreover , on just - dielectric side of the transition this assertion is also valid since the `` expanded '' electron system , which includes the attached leads , in the static limit is on a  homogeneous equilibrium state provided that its segment of interest is open , at least , partially .    within the model of isotropic fermi liquid",

    "we will regard the electrons to be confined by infinitely high potential walls at side boundaries of the region and specify this fact by the dirichlet conditions as follows , @xmath29 as far as open ends of the system are concerned , the bc problem is resolved somewhat less trivially . the mere fact that the system is open , even partially , implies non - hermicity of the operator in the domain .",
    "this may cause some vagueness regarding the applicability of the formula , whose derivation relies essentially on hermitian property of the hamilton operator . in the case of a finite - length system",
    ", the hermitizing bc at @xmath30 would in fact correspond to its closeness ( or periodicity ) in @xmath31-direction , which does not conform with the requirement of current overflow between _ independent _ reservoirs .    in this study , in view of the chosen green function formalism , to specify the openness of the quantum system we employ the method based on the analogy between the problem and that of the monochromatic point source radiation in a classical waveguide . when solving the latter problem , sommerfeld radiation conditions are normally used @xcite , which imply for the source positioned at some finite coordinate the existence of solely outgoing waves at infinity . in order to adapt these conditions to the system under consideration it is necessary to prolong the disordered and magnetic - field - subjected segment of the electron waveguide with semi - infinite ideal leads , in which the electron waves generated at some point inside the segment could propagate freely to infinity , not being subjected to any kind of backscattering . then , joining of the solutions to eq .   at interfaces @xmath30 within the electron waveguide results in the complete solution corresponding to the infinite open system , thereby giving rise to the correct bc at the ends of the segment of interest .",
    "this somewhat troublesome procedure will be done in the appendix , where the trial green functions , which serve as a basis for the exact solution to equation , are obtained .",
    "apart from the openness bc , one more problem is to be resolved before we proceed to the conductance calculation . specifically , this is the choice of the vector potential gage corresponding to the in - plane magnetic field @xmath32 . here , the main motivation is to avoid quadratic confinement in @xmath31-direction .",
    "the lack of such a confinement enables one to employ the transverse eigenfunction basis consisting of waveguide modes , both extended and evanescent , instead of normally used isotropic plane - wave basis .",

    "we have demonstrated that the appreciable localizing effect produced by relatively weak in - plane magnetic field on 2d electron and hole systems can be reasonably interpreted in the context of fermi liquid theory applied to spinless electrons which reside in an open near - surface potential well of finite rather than zero width . for a relatively weak magnetic field",
    ", its coupling to the carrier orbital degree of freedom , even though it is rather weak from semi - classical point of view , proves to have substantial influence on the carrier spectrum and , hence , on the conductance .",
    "the conclusion about strong sensitivity of the carrier spectrum to the in - plane magnetic field is made from the analogy of tightly gated solid - state systems to classical wave - guiding systems of planar , though three - dimensional , configuration .",
    "the mode content of these well - known objects is quite sensitive to the anisotropy in their cross - section , that is to the applied gate voltage as far as electron devices are concerned .",
    "a remarkable feature of the latter type of systems is that in case the magnetic field is applied to the finite length , these systems can be thought of as being subjected to both the disorder potential , whose correlation length can be arbitrary , and the additive deterministic strongly non - local `` magnetic '' potential barrier .",
    "scattering parameters of this barrier are specified by the magnetic field strength and orientation , on the one hand , and by the length of magnetically biased section of the quantum waveguide , on the other . the effect produced by this barrier results from the mismatching of electron spectra in the inner and outer parts of the quantum well , the inner part representing the  finite - length electron system under consideration .",
    "if the electron waveguide cross - section is strongly anisotropic , the bulk of transverse modes in the electron spectrum proves to be efficiently transformed from extended to evanescent type as the magnetic field grows slightly .",
    "this is because electron scattering from side boundaries of the confining potential well is , in the strict sense , specular if the boundaries are considered as completely inhibiting the transverse current flow . in view of this fact",
    ", it seems to be erroneous to assess the magnetic field effect on the electron system by simply estimating the variation of the electron trajectory portions between successive collisions with quantum well boundaries .",
    "it can be easily verified from eqs . and   that the mode truncation effect of the magnetic field is the more significant the larger is the aspect ratio of the waveguide cross - section , given the dimension @xmath8 . for @xmath8",
    "being small enough , such that only modes with quantization parameter @xmath147 in the corresponding direction can be regarded as extended , the total number of extended modes in the quantum waveguide is mainly determined by the larger cross - section dimension , @xmath7 in the case under study .",
    "owing to this , even slight alteration of the magnetic field can transform a considerable number of modes from extended to evanescent type , thus leading to significant reduction of the conductance , even though it might have a  large ( ballistic ) value in the absence of the magnetic field .",
    "the mode truncation effect of in - plane magnetic field appears to be quite similar to that of truly geometric confinement of the electron system .",
    "the closing of each of the current - carrying modes , which makes itself evident in the form of conductance jumps by exactly one conductance quantum in a perfect system at a zero temperature , should be regarded as a true quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "this statement is substantiated by the indisputable fact that there exists a well - defined correlation length in the vicinity of a  closing point , whose role is played by the wave length of the marginal extended mode , which tends to diverge as the critical point is approached .",
    "the closing of the last conducting mode by means of the in - plane magnetic field may thus be regarded as the magnetic - field - driven mit .",
    "it should be noted that in the proximity to the mit the conductance is not quite precisely described by the present theory , since it is hard to satisfy wms conditions over the corresponding range of system parameters . at the same time , closer examination of magnetic - field - originated items in eq .",
    "reveals that the above - described mode truncation effect and , hence , the very fact of the existence of magnetic - field - driven mit , is robust .    in this paper",
    "we have not focused our attention upon the conductance anisotropy with respect to in - plane orientation of the magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding analysis is straightforward .",
    "it consists in comparing the real part of anisotropic self - energy and the magnetic part of the trial mode energy . under wms condition ,",
    "both of these energy items are of the same order of magnitude , save the case of the magnetic field oriented nearly parallel to the direction of current .",
    "we thus expect the conductance anisotropy to be expressed , at most , moderately . moreover , in view of numerical coefficients in eq .",
    "being model - specific , the conductance anisotropy in practice should be governed substantially by the confinement potential profile .",
    "it should be noted that assuming the magnetic field to grow beyond wms limit , the isotropic terms proportional to @xmath148 can be made dominating in self - energy , thereby removing the in - plane anisotropy of the conductance .",
    "this range of the magnetic field strength needs to be given a special consideration because the `` magnetic scattering '' , which is an important aspect of our approach , can not be regarded as weak in this particular case .",
    "yet another relevant remark should be made concerning the model of the confinement potential adopted in this study . in some papers where laterally confined electron systems are dealt with ( see ,",
    "e.  g. , ref.@xcite ) , this potential is taken as a  quadratic function .",
    "thus modelled confinement seems to be beneficial from the technical point of view , as it enables one to account for the magnetic field non - perturbatively , the corresponding transverse eigen - states being known as fock - darwin levels @xcite .",
    "it is natural that the precisely zero width of those levels in the absence of any disorder implies the entire lack of dephasing due to the magnetic field only . in this case",
    ", the magnetoconductance should not exhibit a dip structure because the latter results from mdos singularities arising exclusively in the presence of the disorder .    in the domain of weak magnetic fields ( in a sense of inequality )",
    "the quadratic confinement can hardly be substantiated .",
    "therefore , the issue of the magnetic - field - induced mode entanglement and the related dephasing of the mode states might seem to be quite topical in this limiting case .",
    "note , however , that although rectangular confinement possesses appreciable inter - mode magnetic scattering , it proves not to result in widening the transverse quantization levels unless some kind of disorder is also taken into account .",
    "the exact form of transverse eigen - functions is of no fundamental significance for the development of transport theories in mode representation , but the mere fact of transverse energy quantization does matter .",
    "this prompts us to expect that the magnetic field alone can not give rise to noticeable decoherence of electron states for any hard - wall model of the electron confinement .",
    "the specific form of the confinement potential can only alter the arrangement of transverse quantization levels and , consequently , influence the coherence properties of the electron system indirectly .",

    "<S> the conductance of an open quench - disordered two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron system subject to an in - plane magnetic field is calculated within the framework of conventional fermi liquid theory applied to actually a three - dimensional system of spinless electrons confined to a highly anisotropic ( planar ) near - surface potential well . using the calculation method suggested in this paper , the  magnetic field piercing a finite range of infinitely long system of carriers is treated as introducing the additional highly non - local scatterer which separates the circuit thus modelled into three parts  the system as such and two perfect leads . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse quantization spectrum of the inner part of the electron waveguide thus constructed can be effectively tuned by means of the magnetic field , even though the least transverse dimension of the waveguide is small compared to the magnetic length . </S>",
    "<S> the initially finite ( metallic ) value of the conductance , which is attributed to the existence of extended modes of the transverse quantization , decreases rapidly as the magnetic field grows . </S>",
    "<S> this decrease is due to the mode number reduction effect produced by the magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the closing of the last current - carrying mode , which is slightly sensitive to the disorder level , is suggested as the origin of the magnetic - field - driven metal - to - insulator transition widely observed in 2d systems . </S>"
