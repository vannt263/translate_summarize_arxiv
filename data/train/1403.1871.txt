    "further , in the case of an open qd , a nano system of zero diminution , where the electrons enter and exit the dots through the leads , one has an analog computer of the compound nucleus , since resonances in the electron conductance are in general overlapping and resemble very much the behavior of complex chaotic systems .",

    "there is an extensive literature devoted to the study of the statistical properties of the electronic conductance in ballistic open quantum dots ( qds ) containing a large number of electrons.@xcite in such systems , it is customary to assume that the underlying electronic dynamics is chaotic to statistically describe the electron transport properties using the random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite and the landauer conductance formula@xcite within this framework , the conductance fluctuations are universal functions that depend on the quantum dot symmetries , such as time - reversal , and on the number of open modes n connecting the qd to its source and drain reservoirs . in the semiclassical limit of large n , the transmission statistical fluctuations are accurately modeled by gaussian processes . in practice , it has been experimentally observed @xcite and theoretically explained @xcite that , even for small values of n and at very low temperatures , dephasing quickly brings the qd conductance fluctuations close to the gaussian limit . the electronic conductance in open ballistic qds exhibits random fluctuations as an external parameter , such as a magnetic field b or an applied gate voltage vg , is varied .",
    "so far , the majority of the studies concentrate on the study of conductance distributions , which usually demand very large experimental statistical sampling to allow comparison with theory .",
    "this invites one the ask whether something useful can be extracted from a direct analysis of a single conductance curve . inspired by the formal analogy between conductance and compound - nucleus ericson fluctuations @xcite we show that the answer is positive .",
    "more specifically , inspired by results obtained about 50 years ago in nuclear physics,@xcite , ( see also @xcite ) we calculate the average density of maxima in the conductance and show its relation with the conductance correlation function . using the random matrix theory prediction for the latter , we find a new universal observable in the ballistic conductance of open quantum dots .",
