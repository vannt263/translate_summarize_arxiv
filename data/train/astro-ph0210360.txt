    "lp 94420  ( = bri 0337 - 3535 ) is an isolated nearby brown dwarf ( mass@xmath110.075  m@xmath12 ) first identified by @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations reported by @xcite give a spectral type of dm9 , an age of about 500 myr and a mass of about 0.065  m@xmath12 using the lithium test proposed by @xcite . because of its substellar mass and its proximity to the sun , this object is a benchmark in the study of very low - mass objects .",
    "lp 94420  was observed in the x - ray regime for the first time with the _ rosat _ satellite by @xcite , but was not detected .",
    "it has been detected with the _ chandra _ satellite @xcite in december 1999 during an x - ray flare of duration @xmath13 hours . outside the flare , lp",
    "94420  was not detected with a 3 @xmath14 upper limit on the emission at @xmath15 @xmath6 .",
    "both quiescent and flaring radio emission have been observed with the vla @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission is widespread among fully - convective m dwarfs ( spectral type m3 and later ) , and it is frequently variable @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations of ultracool dwarfs ( spectral type m7 and later ) are still very scarce .",
    "strong variability has been observed in a few objects @xcite .",
    "it is thought that the x - ray photons are emitted from a hot corona .",
    "the properties of coronae ( permanent or transient ) in ultracool dwarfs are not well understood .",
    "lp 94420  was targeted for observations with _",
    "xmm  newton _  for two reasons mainly , first to try to catch it during a flare , which would have allowed to obtain spectroscopy if a flare had occurred , and second to search for quiescent x - ray emission .",
    "unfortunately , we did not detect lp 94420  at all .",
    "nevertheless , we improve the value of the upper limit on the quiescent x - ray emission from lp 94420 , and we derive x - ray flare rates as a function of x - ray luminosity that may be useful for planning future observations of this brown dwarf .",
    "_ xmm  newton _  observed lp 94420  on 2001 january 07 - 08 , between 14:21:05 and 04:43:52 utc for 51767 s. the pointing position was @xmath16 and @xmath17 epoch 2000 , according to the simbad database .      besides its three x - ray telescopes , _",
    "xmm  newton _  also has a 30-cm optical - uv telescope , providing the possibility to observe simultaneously in the x - ray and optical - uv regimes .",
    "the optical monitor ( _ om _ ) was used with the @xmath18 filter for four exposures of 5000  s each in imaging mode .",
    "the om detector has a format of @xmath19 pixels , each @xmath20 .",
    "the field of view is therefore @xmath21 .",
    "we used the data given by the om to confirm the presence of the source in the field of view .",
    "the coordinates we used to identify lp 94420  are different from the pointing coordinates .",
    "we used the more recent coordinates given by the astrometry of @xcite after their observation of lp 94420  with _ chandra _ during a x - ray flare in 1999 december .",
    "these coordinates are : @xmath22 and @xmath23 , epoch 1999.95 .",
    "we identified lp 94420  in the field of view by plotting these coordinates on the four images given by the om .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we found a point - source at a distance of @xmath24 from the expected coordinates of lp 94420 .",
    "this offset is small in comparison with the @xmath25 known systematic uncertainties in the _ xmm  newton _  preprocessing analysis astrometry @xcite .",
    "moreover a small offset was also expected because of the proper motion of lp 94420  since it was observed by @xcite more than one year ago .",
    "the offset in the optical position is consistent with the known proper motion of lp 94420 .",
    "we were also able to identify the three other sources in the field of view simply by direct comparison with the image obtained by @xcite .",
    "we therefore identify this optical source with the brown dwarf lp 94420  on the basis of positional coincidence with the expected coordinates .",
    "we also used the four exposures given by the om to look for optical variability .",
    "the magnitudes of the source identified as lp 94420  and of two other stars in the field of view were calculated using the _ iraf _ ` phot ` task .",
    "this allowed us to plot the evolution of the magnitude during the whole observation .",
    "the result is shown in figure [ maglp94420 ] .",
    "the behavior of lp 94420 s magnitude is different than that of the two other stars .",
    "we notice that whereas the magnitudes of the two reference stars are roughly correlated , lp 94420 s magnitudes are not .",
    "we measure a mean magnitude of @xmath116.736 and a standard deviation of 0.081 for lp 94420 . for reference star 1",
    "we measure a mean magnitude of @xmath116.681 and a standard deviation of 0.028 . for reference star 2",
    "we measure a mean magnitude of @xmath116.770 and a standard deviation of 0.067 .",
    "we conclude that lp 94420  may be variable in the om data .",
    "the variability of lp 94420 , however , is only slightly higher than that of reference star 2 .",
    "we can not make a definitive claim that lp 94420  is variable in our data because of the lack of enough reference stars in the field of view .",
    "the european photon imaging camera ( _ epic _ ) mos1 & mos2 were used .",
    "the total ontarget exposure time in each camera was 48724 s in prime full window mode with 2.5 s time resolution .",
    "the epic pn was used in prime full window mode with 73.4 ms time resolution and ontarget exposure 46618  s. each epic instrument was used with the thin filter , which suppresses the optical contamination up to @xmath26 of 18 ( mos ) or @xmath26 of 17 ( pn ) .",
    "both mos & pn detectors have a circular field of view of @xmath27 diameter . for more details on",
    "_ xmm  newton _  and its instruments , we refer to @xcite .",
    "the first step was to search for lp 94420  in the field of view of each epic mos & pn detector .",
    "we plotted the coordinates of lp 94420  on each image obtained by each detector , but we did not detect any source . to be sure that we were using the most sensitive exposure , we used the image given by the pipeline which combines data from all epic s mos & pn in the entire energy range ( @xmath28 @xmath29 ) , as shown in figure [ mospn1 ] .    on these figures ,",
    "the x - ray source closest to the expected position is offset by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this offset is large in comparison with the @xmath32 offset observed with the optical data .",
    "so at this point we already knew that lp 94420  was not detected .",
    "we performed differential astrometry between the _ xmm  newton _  and _ chandra _ images .",
    "this allowed us to identify all the x - ray sources in our field of view in an area of @xmath33 centered on the expected coordinates of lp 94420 .",
    "we were then able to conclude that lp 94420  was not detected during the _ xmm  newton _  observation .",
    "since the target was not detected , the first conclusion is that there was no significant x - ray flare during this @xmath34 ks observation . nevertheless , it is interesting to calculate the upper limit on the time average quiescent x - ray luminosity .",
    "we did the calculation of the upper limit of x - ray flux with each of the 3 images of the preprocessing products , corresponding to the 3 exposures obtained with the epic mos1 , mos2 & pn detectors on the entire energy range ( @xmath28 kev ) . to calculate a @xmath35 flux upper limit , we considered an area of twice the fwhm ( @xmath36 pixels ) around the expected position of lp 94420 . in this area",
    "we calculated the mean value of @xmath37 and the corresponding standard deviation @xmath14 using the iraf ` phot ` task , which gives count rates corrected for background .",
    "the results are listed in table [ table1 ] . as the epic pn camera is the most sensitive detector ,",
    "we therefore only consider its result to calculate the flux upper limit .    to convert this count rate to flux , we followed @xcite instructions , by using the pimmssoftware .",
    "as lp 94420  was not detected during the observation , we were not able to fit its spectrum in order to know its spectral type .",
    "we adopted the results of @xcite summarized in table [ table2 ] .",
    "the hi column density was calculated using the _ _ nh__software : @xmath38@xmath39 .",
    "the results for the upper limit of flux and x - ray luminosity ( 3@xmath14 , assuming gaussian statistics ) are listed in table [ table3 ] .",
    "the uncertainties on these values are poisson ( counting statistics ) plus @xmath40 spectral uncertainty , according to @xcite . as their best fit on the spectrum",
    "was obtained with the raymond ",
    "smith thermal plasma model , we finally kept the corresponding 3 @xmath14 flux as the upper limit on the time average quiescent x - ray luminosity for lp 94420 : @xmath41 , equivalent to a luminosity ratio upper limit of @xmath7 .",
    "the first observation of lp 94420  in the x - ray regime by @xcite with the _ rosat _ satellite placed an upper limit of @xmath42 after a 220 ks _ rosat ",
    "hri _ observation .",
    "the second x - ray observation @xcite placed a better upper limit of @xmath43 after the 44 ks _",
    "acis - s _ observation before the flare .",
    "our new value improves this upper limit of quiescent x - ray emission at @xmath44 .",
    "the corresponding upper limit of x - ray luminosity ( @xmath45 ) is thus improved by a factor 3 .",
    "this value is close to the solar x - ray emission level during its maxima of activity .    in figure [ logl_vs_sptype ]",
    "we display the dependence of x - ray activity versus spectral type for m dwarfs .",
    "the upper envelope of x - ray activity is remarkably independent of m subclass .",
    "there is no obvious connection between age and x - rays .",
    "the m dwarfs in the chai , @xmath46oph and taurus star - forming regions show x - ray emission comparable to much older field dwarfs @xcite .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for a decline in coronal emission with increasing age in fully convective m dwarfs .",
    "we have estimated the rate of x - ray flare occurrence in lp 94420  by adding 287.5 ks of _ rosat _ data analyzed by @xcite , 43.8 ks of _ chandra _ data analyzed by @xcite and 51.7 ks of _ xmm  newton _  data ( this paper ) .",
    "the duration of the only flare so far observed was 2.76 ks @xcite .",
    "thus , we get an x - ray flare frequency of 0.72% for flares with luminosity log@xmath82.5 .",
    "weaker flares could not have been detected by _",
    "rosat_. thus , we derive the duty cycle of flares with luminosity comparable with the flare detected by _ chandra _ [ log@xmath94.1 ] to be about 6% .",
    "the published vla radio data have a duration of 79.9 ks @xcite .",
    "three flares were detected with a total duration of @xmath1010.4 ks .",
    "hence , we estimate a radio flare frequency of about 13% . it is not known to what x - ray luminosity the radio flares correspond , but we can set an upper limit using the _ xmm  newton _  data . if we assume a flare duty cycle of 13% , the flare x - ray luminosity has to be log@xmath475.39 to be consistent with our non detection .",
    "lp 94420  is a relatively inactive object .",
    "@xcite reported h@xmath48 weakly in emission . @xcite",
    "estimated a surface magnetic field strength of b@xmath105 g assuming synchrotron emission during the radio flares .",
    "for comparison , active dm stars have magnetic field strengths of a few kg , solar flares have b@xmath10100 g , and jupiter has an average b@xmath1010 g @xcite .",
    "our low upper limit on the quiescent x - ray emission of lp 94420  is consistent with a weak magnetic field .",
    "the detection of low - amplitude photometric variability in lp 94420 , and the low - level of x - ray emission in this object , suggests the presence of surface thermal inhomogeneities due to nonmagnetic clouds , as discussed by @xcite for lp 94420  and by @xcite for the m9.5 dwarf bri0021 - 0214 .",
    "recent theoretical works @xcite show that in ultracool dwarfs there should not be much interaction between the gas and the magnetic field because the reynolds number is very low throughout the photosphere .",
    "lp 94420  appears to be an object with substellar mass , weak magnetic field , fast rotation and cloudy atmosphere .",
    "we speculate that the radio activity may be enhanced by the presence of a close planetary - mass companion ( io - type ) , which provides a continuous supply of ionized particles to the ionosphere of lp 94420 .",
    "radial velocity variability has been detected by @xcite which could be due to a planetary - mass close companion , but they did not have enough data to derive an orbital period .    this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france .",
    "support for this project has been provided by nasa grant nag5 - 9992 .",
    "we thank our collaborators gibor basri , lars bildsten and bob rutledge , and an anonymous referee for helpful discussions .",
