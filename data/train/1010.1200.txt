    "the experimental ability to create a superfluid alkali atom fermi gas in optical lattices@xcite opens a new opportunity to study strongly correlated quantum many - particle systems and to emulate high - temperature superconductors .",
    "theoretical description of ultracold atomic bose and fermi gases in optical lattices has attracted much attention.@xcite near the feshbach resonance the atom - atom interaction can be manipulated in a controllable way because the scattering length @xmath0 can be changed from the bcs side ( negative values ) to the bec side ( positive values ) reaching very large values close to resonance . on bec side of the resonance the spin - up and spin - down atoms can form diatomic molecules , and these bosonic molecules can undergo a bec at low enough temperature.@xcite in what follow we focus our attention on the bcs side ( negative scattering length ) where bcs superfluidity is expected analogous to superconductivity . in particular , we consider an equal mixture of atomic fermi gas of two hyperfine states with contact interaction loaded into an optical lattice .",
    "the two hyperfine states are described by pseudospins @xmath1 .",
    "we also assume that the number of atoms in each hyperfine state per site ( the filling factor ) is smaller than unity , and that the lattice potential is sufficiently deep such that the tight - binding approximation is valid .",
    "the system in this case is well described by the single - band attractive hubbard model : @xmath2 here , the fermi operator @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) creates ( destroys ) a fermion on the lattice site @xmath5 with pseudospin @xmath1 and @xmath6 is the density operator on site @xmath5 with a position vector @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the chemical potential , and the symbol @xmath9 means sum over nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "@xmath10 is the tunneling strength of the atoms between nearest - neighbor sites , and @xmath11 is the on - site interaction . on the bcs side",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath11 is positive ( the atomic interaction is attractive ) .",
    "we assume @xmath12 and the lattice constant @xmath13 .    in the case when the periodic array of microtraps is generated by counter propagating laser beams with different frequencies , the lattice is not stationary anymore .",
    "it is expected that the formation of a bcs superfluidity is possible , but due to the presence of supercurrent ( or quasimomentum @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mass of the trapped atoms and @xmath16 is the lattice velocity ) the superflow can break down .",
    "recently , the stability of superfluid fermi gases loaded into an optical lattice in the presence of supercurrent has been studied using the second - order time - dependent perturbation theory@xcite ( this method is a generalization of the earlier approach by belkhir and randeria@xcite ) , and the green s function formalism.@xcite in what follows , we derive the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equations for the spectrum of the collective modes in the case of a moving optical lattice , and compare the bs formalism with the above - mentioned two methods .",
