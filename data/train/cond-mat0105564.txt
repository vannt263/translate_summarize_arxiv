    "the peak in the quasiparticle weight obtained within rg approach is more broad than in the second - order perturbation theory , which is the consequence of larger electron damping in the letter case . with the increasing the chemical potential ( so that the system is moved away from qpt ) , the higher - order renormalizations become less important and",
    "the behavior of the self - energy reproduces the result of the second - order perturbation theory .",

    "close to the quantum phase transition into the ordered state , the peaks in the self - energy should become asymmetric , as discussed in ref .",

    "the spin - fermion theory @xcite is applicable .",
    "in the present paper we have investigated within a scaling approach the energy dependence of the real and imaginary part of the electron self - energy in the presence of van hove singularities . we have restricted ourselves to the regions of the @xmath132 phase diagram , where the fermi level is not too close to vh points ( disordered ground state , @xmath133 with @xmath134 is the critical chemical potential ) or temperature is above the critical value ( @xmath93 with @xmath135 ) .    provided the system is not too close to qpt ( at @xmath133 ) , the imaginary part of the self - energy at vh points demonstrates in a broad energy region @xmath66 a nearly - linear behavior , @xmath136 , which is close to that in the marginal fermi - liquid concept @xcite ( however , in mfl the linear behavior of @xmath137 takes place for arbitrary @xmath138 ) .",
    "the real part of the self - energy behaves as @xmath139 the linear energy dependence of the self - energy ( [ s2 ] ) and the behaviour of the slope with changing @xmath22 are in agreement with the rg results of ref .",
    "@xcite which takes into account of the contribution of the whole fermi - surface .",
    "these dependences are also similar to those obtained within the spin - fermion model for a nearly antiferromagnetic state @xcite , although in our case they have a different nature and are governed by van hove singularities themselves rather than by closeness to antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition .",
    "the role of a characteristic spin - fluctuation frequency @xmath140 which separates the fermi - liquid and mfl regimes , belongs in our case to the chemical potential @xmath141 ( @xmath142 corresponds to vh filling ) .",
    "another difference is that in the presence of vh singularities the linear dependence of self - energy takes place already in the weak - coupling regime .    near qpt ,",
    "the renormalizations become important because of the large ground - state correlation length which enters renormalized vertices .",
    "therefore both real and imaginary parts of the self - energy increase considerably as @xmath143 such an anomalous behavior also implies a strong violation of the fermi - liquid and even mfl picture .",
    "note that the anomalies under consideration may induce the electron topological transition with the truncation of the fermi surface ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "the rg approach used is not able to describe the magnetically ordered or superconducting state . by this reason",
    ", the renormalized - classical regime @xmath144 @xmath145 should be considered within other approaches , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .    in 2d situation",
    ", the physical properities near qpt should demonstrate singularities which are stronger than those in the 3d case .",
    "the correction to the electron density of states @xmath146 reads @xmath147\\ ] ] main contribution to the integral comes from the vicinity of vh points where the bare density of states is logarithmically divergent .",
    "taking into account that @xmath148 , we obtain for the first ( coherent ) term in the square brackets which originates from renormalization of quasiparticle spectrum @xmath149 the calculation of the second ( incoherent , non - quasiparticle ) term requires the full form of @xmath150 eq.([sigma ] ) , and leads to the result @xmath151 although this divergence is slightly weaker than of the coherent term , it is not cut at @xmath152 thereby the bare vh singularity becomes considerably enhanced .",
    "note that the divergence of the density of states together with its asymmetry in @xmath112 may lead to peculiarities of thermoelectric power owing to impurity scattering , cf .",
    "ref.@xcite .    to leading ( second ) order the contribution to electronic specific heat owing to vh singularities has the form @xmath153 the behavior @xmath154 the calculations are similar to those of ref.@xcite for the antiferromagnetic state , extra logarithmic factors coming from vh singularities .",
    "the crossover from quadratic to nearly linear temperature dependence of resistivity is confirmed by experimental data for cuprates ( see , e.g. , the results of ref.@xcite for the lasrcuo system )",
    ".    thus the divergences in the many - electron system with vh singularities are stronger than those in the mfl theory .",
    "near qpt , we can expect that all the physical properties are strongly renormalized , the renormalizations being dependent on the type of the ordered phase .",
    "this problem will be considered elsewhere .",
    "finally we consider the application of the results obtained to cuprate systems .",
    "a nearly linear energy dependence of @xmath155 at vh points , which is similar to our results , was observed for the system bi2212 in arpes experiments @xcite . for the system la@xmath156sr@xmath157cuo@xmath158 with the doping @xmath159 ( which is slightly larger than the optimal one ) the fermi surface crosses vh points @xcite .",
