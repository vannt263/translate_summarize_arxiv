    "the insulator - superfluid transition is an example of quantum phase transitions which take place at zero temperature . at the transition",
    "point the quantum ground state of the system changes in some fundamental way .",
    "this is accomplished by changing some parameter in the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "possible examples are transition between different quantized plateaus in a quantum - hall effect under the change of magnetic field , transition between different phases in high-@xmath0 superconductor compounds under the variation of doping , metal - insulator transition in a conductor under the change of disorder , or phase transitions in baryonic matter under the change of density ( e.g. , transition from nuclear matter to a uniform liquid of neutrons , protons and electrons at the interface between a crust and a core of a neutron star ) .    originally the insulator - conductor transition has been studied in fermi systems . however , analogous phenomena occur for a system of bosons , for example , in @xmath1he absorbed in porous media or granular superconductors in which the cooper pairs may be considered as bosons . for pure bose systems at zero temperature the conducting phase is the superfluid , so that the insulator - conductor transition corresponds to the onset of superfluidity . in the context of insulator - superfluid transition in liquid @xmath1he the problem has been studied in @xcite .",
    "recently such a problem attracted much attention due to experimental realization of bose - einstein condensation ( bec )  of atoms in magnetic and optical traps .",
    "it has been proposed that the insulator - superfluid transition might be observable when an ultracold gas of atoms with repulsive interactions is trapped in a periodic optical lattice @xcite .",
    "recently the transition in @xmath2rb condensate in a three - dimensional simple - cubic potential was realized experimentally by changing the potential depth @xcite .",
    "an artificial optical lattice has a great advantage in that the system is basically defect - free which provides ideal conditions for study the quantum phase transitions .    in the insulator phase",
    "the atoms are localized ( by the effect of the potential ) in the lattice sites so that fluctuations in the atom number on each site are suppressed .",
    "in such a state there is no phase coherence across the lattice .",
    "in addition the mott insulator phase is characterized by the existence of an energy gap for the creation of particle or hole excitations , i.e. , for the addition of particles to , or removal of particles from , the system . in a periodic potential",
    "the bosons can move from one lattice site to the next by quantum tunneling .",
    "the heights of the barriers can readily be adjusted since they are proportional to the intensity of the laser beam .",
    "the competition between the tunneling amplitude ( kinetic energy ) and the atom - atom interactions controls the point of the phase transition . when the tunneling coupling becomes large compared to the atom - atom interactions a delocalized wavefunction minimizes the dominant kinetic energy and the system undergoes a phase transition into the superfluid state .",
    "in such a state the atom number per site is not fixed and the wavefunction exhibits long - range phase coherence .",
    "recent theoretical studies include a delocalizing transition of bec in optical lattices @xcite , the superfluid density and the quasi - momentum distribution @xcite , the superfluid to mott insulator transition with high filling factors ( multiband situation ) @xcite , commensurate - incommensurate transition @xcite , as well as monte carlo simulations for the bose - hubbard systems @xcite .",
    "an advantage of an optical trap is that it liberates the spin degrees of freedom and makes possible condensation of spinor bosons .",
    "for example , @xmath3na , @xmath4k and @xmath2rb atoms ( with nuclear spin @xmath5 and electrons at @xmath6 orbits ) at low temperatures behave as simple bosons with a hyperfine spin @xmath7 .",
    "optically trapped bec creates a possibility to study a variety of phenomena in spinor many boson systems which posses extremely rich physics .",
    "the insulator - superfluid transition in spinor bec is one of the possible novel phenomena .",
    "recently the insulator - superfluid transition of spin-1 bosons interacting antiferromagnetically in an optical lattice was investigated theoretically @xcite , as well as the transition in a multicomponent bec system @xcite and spin-2 bose atoms @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the phase transition of spin@xmath8 bosons in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "magnetic field lifts a degeneracy of the antiferromagnetic ground state and enriches the phase diagram .",
    "we show that magnetic field results in a qualitatively new effect . depending on the field value the transition for bosons with antiferromagnetic interparticle interaction may occur into different superfluid phases with spins aligned along or opposite to the field direction .",
    "we consider a dilute gas of trapped bosonic atoms with hyperfine spin @xmath7 .",
    "the system is described by the following hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath9 , where the spin symmetric and asymmetric parts are @xmath10    @xmath11 @xmath12 here @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the atomic field annihilation operator associated with atoms in the hyperfine spin state @xmath15 is the optical lattice potential which is assumed to be the same for all three spin components , @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the wavelength of the laser light , @xmath18 is the tunable depth of the potential well .",
    "the coefficients @xmath19 , @xmath20 are related to scattering lengths @xmath21 and @xmath22 of two colliding bosons with total angular momenta @xmath23 and @xmath24 by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the mass of the atom @xcite . for scattering of @xmath28na @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the bohr radius @xcite .",
    "this suggests @xmath32 ( antiferromagnetic interaction ) . for @xmath2rb @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xcite , that is @xmath35 and the interaction is ferromagnetic .    for single atoms the energy eigenstates are bloch wave functions .",
    "an appropriate superposition of bloch states yields a set of wannier functions which are localized on the individual lattice sites . expanding the field operators in the wannier basis    @xmath36    where @xmath37 correspond to the bosonic annihilation operators on the @xmath38th lattice site , and keeping terms in first order in the hopping matrix element",

    "this describes tunneling of atoms and is related to the kinetic energy .",
    "the parameter @xmath46 exponentially depends on the strength of periodic potential @xmath18 and can be varied experimentally by several orders of magnitude .",
    "one should mention that when number of particles in each well @xmath47 is large enough the parameters @xmath48 can be reduced by a factor @xmath49 .",
    "this occurs when condensates in each well reach the thomas - fermi regime .",
    "however , in experiments on 3d optical lattices @xmath50 and the thomas - fermi regime is usually not achieved .",
    "higher filling factor can be realized in 2d and 1d lattices @xcite . also , equation ( [ q21 ] )",
    "suggests that atoms in different spin states are approximately described by the same coordinate wave function which is the case when the spin symmetric interaction is strong compared with the asymmetric part : @xmath51na and @xmath2rb atoms @xcite .",

    "the most interesting effects occur when the magnetic energy @xmath66 is less than or comparable with the energy of spin asymmetric interaction . for such values of magnetic field",
    "the energy of spin symmetric interaction is much larger than @xmath66 and , hence , the description of atoms in different spin states by the same coordinate wave function is justified for such magnetic field .    the consistent mean - field theory we will use corresponds to the following decomposition of the hopping terms @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the three component superfluid order parameter .",
    "in such a decomposition we omit the higher - order fluctuations @xmath69 .",
    "also we assume the order parameter to be real and neglect the josephson - type tunneling term .",
