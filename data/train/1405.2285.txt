    "<S> we now discuss how the strain induced transition from a state with edge states in the energy gap to the insulating state without such states might be detected in transport . </S>",
    "<S> the two horizontal lines visible in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3n](a ) and ( b ) denote the conduction window @xmath34 , where @xmath6 is the source - drain voltage , defined by the fermi levels of the left ( l ) and right ( r)leads . the number @xmath5 of edge states with the energy found within this window contributes to the tunneling of electrons from one lead to the other , and current @xmath7 as discussed in the introduction . with our choice of the @xmath35 , at zero strain we find six states , while at @xmath33 the conduction window is empty and the tunneling current can not flow . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3n](c ) we show the effect of the width of the source - drain voltage window on the number @xmath5 of available conduction channels as a function of the strain . </S>",
    "<S> different curves correspond to different source - drain voltages . </S>",
    "<S> we see that a small conduction window contains fewer edge states , exhibits a low critical strain and an abrupt transition from the `` on '' to `` off '' state . </S>",
    "<S> this is the quantitative illustration of the central result of our work presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1n ] . </S>",
    "<S> as the conduction window increases , the `` on '' current increases due to the increased number of conduction channels , and the transition to the `` off '' regime is less abrupt , consists of steps , and exhibits a larger critical strain . </S>",
    "<S> we expect , therefore , that the sensitivity and signal - to - noise ratio can be significantly tuned simply by changing the source - drain voltage of the leads . </S>",
    "<S> the effect discussed here is to be contrasted with piezoelectric sensors where induced charge is a linear function of applied pressure,@xcite but has analogies to single - electron charge detection using conductance steps in quantum point contacts@xcite and pressure induced metal - insulator transitions in thin films@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of strain of few percent is comparable to strains detected using piezoelectric semiconductor nanowires.@xcite    we conclude our proposal by demonstrating that not only the number , but also the nature of the conduction channels changes with the strain . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4n ] we show the radial dependence of the probability densities of the state denoted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3n ] as @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the panels show , respectively , the electron ( red ) and heavy - hole ( blue ) component of this state . </S>",
    "<S> we see that as the strain is increased , the probability density of the electronic component evolves from one peaked at the edge to one peaked in the interior of the disk , while the hole component drops to zero . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as expected , the states begin to resemble those of the ns quantum disk . </S>",
    "<S> as the probability density moves to the center , the tunneling from the leads onto the conduction channels decreases exponentially . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even though a state may be still within the conduction window , its contact to leads ( tunneling matrix element ) , and therefore the tunneling current , decreases as a function of stress .    in conclusion , we present a microscopic theory of a hgte quantum dot as a function of size and applied strain . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated the existence of edge states and their removal with applied strain . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that this mechanism could be used to implement a nanoscale , all - electrical , low - energy strain sensing device , in which the presence of a strain beyond a threshold value could be detected electrically as a collapse of the tunneling current through the edge states of the hgte quantum disk . </S>"
