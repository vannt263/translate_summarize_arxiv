    "observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is fundamental for our understanding the primordial inhomogeneity of the universe .",
    "after the successful cobe experiment , attention has been focused on the investigation of small scale perturbations , that can provide unique information about the most important cosmological parameters .",
    "one of the major problems in the modern cmb cosmology is to separate noise of various origins ( such as dust emission , synchrotron radiation and unresolved point sources ( see e.g. banday et al . 1996 ) ) from the original cosmological signal .",
    "many authors have already applied various methods such as wiener filtering ( tegmark and efstathiou 1996 , bouchet and gispert 1999 ) , maximum entropy technique ( hobson et al .",
    "1999 ) , radical compression ( bond et al .",
    "1998 ) , power filtering ( gorski et .",
    "1997 , naselsky et .",
    "al . 1999 ) and wavelet techniques ( e.g. sanz et al . 1999 ) to extract noise from the cmb data .",
    "all of these techniques have been tested for removing the noise from the real observational data .",
    "it is necessary to note that , for different strategies and for different experiments , different schemes could be chosen as most appropriate .",
    "the choice of the algorithm also depends on the particular type of foreground emission to be extracted .",
    "the aim of our paper is to overcome the problem of detecting and extracting the background of unresolved point sources from the original map .",
    "the measured signal in the real observational data is always smoothed with some filtering angle @xmath0 because of the final antenna beam resolution .",
    "therefore , unresolved point sources could make a significant contribution to the resulting signal on all scales .",
    "this type of noise should be removed from the original map before any subsequent analysis is made .",
    "recently ( cayon et al . 1999 ) have proposed the use of isotropic wavelets for removing noise in the form of point sources .",
    "their technique is based on the fact , that the field in the vicinity of the source should be in the form of the antenna profile .",
    "unfortunately the gaussian cmb field can also form real peaks with the same profile , so that a lot of artificial sources could be found using this technique .",
    "besides , the antenna profile is not necessarily isotropic ( indeed , as a rule it is very anisotropic ) .",
    "therefore , isotropic wavelets should not be considered as an absolute cure against such a type of noise .    in this paper",
    "we consider an approach , which is based on the distribution of phases .",
    "the idea of using phases of random fields was introduced by a.melott et al ( 1991 ) ; coles and chiang ( 2000a , b ) for the large scale structure formation in the universe . below",
    "we develop the phase - amplitude analysis method for investigation of the cmb anisotropy and foreground .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the basic definitions , consider a simulated one - dimensional scan of the cmb first with a single point source , then with a background of such a sources . in section 3",
    "we generalize our results into two - dimensional maps . finally , we suggest an algorithm for denoising . in section 4",
    "we discuss the results and potential of the method for analyzing high resolution maps .",
    "in this section we consider 1d cmb scans with a background of point sources .",
    "this approach could be very useful for data analysis of one - dimensional experiments with high resolution ( such as ratan 600 ) .",
    "we extend this discussion to two - dimensional experiments ( such as the new generation of interferometer experiments ) in section 3 .",
    "the investigation of point sources is especially easy in one dimension , can be easily generalized into two - dimensional maps and will help us to understand the advantage of the proposed technique .    *",
    "definitions *    in 1d the deviation of the temperature from its mean value @xmath1 in a scan is described by the simple fourier series :    @xmath2    where k is an integer number and @xmath3 can be expressed in terms of of the real angle on the sky ( @xmath4 ) as follows : @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 means the total length of the scan .",
    "the detected temperature fluctuations @xmath7 can as usual be naturally divided into two parts : cosmological signal and noise :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote signal and noise respectively . therefore , the fourier transform components @xmath11 can be also expressed as a sum of fourier decomposition of these two terms :    @xmath12    the statistically isotropic distribution of the cmb temperature anisotropy is supposed to be in the form of a random gaussian field with the power spectrum @xmath13 , which determined by the appropriate cosmological model .",
    "the coefficients @xmath14 depend on the spectrum of the cmb , the antenna filtering function @xmath15 and the actual realization of the random gaussian process on the sky .",
    "in general , they obey the formulae : @xmath16 . here",
    ", @xmath17 is the fourier transform of the filtering function and @xmath0 is the antenna resolution angle .",
    "@xmath18 is a wavenumber which corresponds to this resolution : @xmath19 . in our simulations we use the usual expression for @xmath20 :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 are independent gaussian numbers with zero mean and unit dispersion .    in this paper",
    "we consider the noise in the form of isolated unresolved point sources .",
    "this means that the average distance between sources is larger than the resolution scale @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the shape of the noise field around the point source determined by the filtering function f :    @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 are the amplitude and the position of the j - th point source , respectively , and @xmath26 is the total number of point sources in the considered scan .",
    "according to equation [ 5 ] , the fourier components of the noise can be described by the following very simple and convenient formulae :    @xmath27    for further investigation we have to introduce the phase : @xmath28 of the k - th harmonic .",
    "using equations [ 1,3 ] one can write :    @xmath29= \\arctan\\left[\\frac{b_k^s+b_k^n}{a_k^s+a_k^n}\\right]\\ ] ]    if the resulting field at the scales @xmath30 is dominated by the gaussian cmb signal ( @xmath31 ) , then @xmath32 . in this case",
    "the phases of the k - th harmonics are random independent uncorrelated values , uniformly distributed from 0 to @xmath33 . on the other hand , if the signal at these scales is much smaller than the noise , then the distribution of phases is determined by the positions and amplitudes of point sources on the scan . in fig.1",
    ", we present the spectrum of cmb in one dimension @xmath13 for the standard cdm model together with the spectrum of point sources . both spectra are smoothed with the gaussian filtering function @xmath34 .",
    "it is well known that the cmb signal disappears when @xmath30 becomes larger than some value @xmath35 .",
    "this value corresponds to the damping scale of the cmb fluctuations .",
    "therefore , at the small scales the resulting field is dominated by the noise .",
    "note that @xmath35 should not be necessary interpreted as the damping scale . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is the scale where noise from sources becomes larger then the cmb signal .",
    "it is easy to see , from equations [ 4,6,7 ] , that the process of smoothing does not change the phases of the primordial signal .",
    "the filtering function @xmath17 has simply disappeared from the right hand side of the equation [ 7 ] .",
    "therefore , if @xmath36 , we have the possibility of measuring the phases only for high @xmath30 values of the noise .",
    "below we describe how the information about the phase distribution for high values of @xmath30 can be used for very precise detection and extraction of the contribution from the sources for all values of @xmath30    * detection of a single point source *    let us consider the simplest example by dealing with a single unresolved point source on the scan . in order to remove the contribution from this source , we have to know its precise location @xmath37 and amplitude @xmath38 ( see fig.2 ) .    the contribution from this source to the resulting field according to equation [ 5 ] is then :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the maximum value of @xmath30 that can be detected in the experiment .",
    "as has been already mentioned , for @xmath30 larger then some value @xmath35 , phases @xmath28 are just the phases of the point source . from equations [ 6,7 ] ,",
    "we obtain :    @xmath41    it suffices to have only two phases ( for example @xmath28 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) to find the location of the source @xmath37 :    @xmath44    in fig.3 we show the behavior of the phases @xmath28 , @xmath45 together with the phases of the source . for small values of @xmath30 : @xmath46 the phases are distributed uniformly and at large @xmath30 we can definitely see the regular structure that is consistent with equation [ 9 ] .    in fig.4",
    "we also show the positions of maxima for all harmonics .",
    "location of the maxima for the k - th harmonic can be found by the formulae :    @xmath47    where n is an integer number .",
    "the straight vertical line points to the location of the source because one of the maxima in each harmonic is coincident with this location .",
    "the remaining part of the problem is to find the amplitude - @xmath38 .",
    "let us defined the field @xmath48 as a part of the field @xmath49 that consists only of the high harmonics :    @xmath50    using the formulae [ 8 ] , we now can write down the obvious relation : @xmath51    therefore , according to [ 3,6 ] , we have found the contribution from this source to all harmonics from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "* background of point sources *    in this subsection we generalize our algorithm to the case where there are an unknown number of point sources in the considered scan . in a situation like this",
    ", we have to find not only positions and amplitudes of each source but also the total number of them : @xmath26 .",
    "we believe that many different techniques based on the results of the previous subsection could be proposed to solve this problem .",
    "we suggest a simple iteration scheme .",
    "as has been already noticed above , we can consider the field @xmath54 , which consists only of high harmonics .",
    "therefore , only point sources make a contribution to this field : @xmath55 we now introduce the filter function @xmath56 and consider the filtered field : @xmath57 according to [ 14,15 ] , one can write :    @xmath58    if we can put @xmath59 , then the second term on the right hand side of equation [ 16 ] is small and :    @xmath60    this equation is very close to [ 8 ] and , therefore , the procedure of filtering gives us the possibility of localizing the field in the vicinity of a point source .",
    "in reality equation [ 17 ] is not quite correct because @xmath35 and @xmath40 are values of approximately the same order and , therefore , peaks , that are more or less close to each other can interfere ( fig .",
    "this is the reason why we choose the iteration technique to remove point sources .",
    "we propose the following algorithm .",
    "let us construct the field @xmath61 and find its highest maximum .",
    "this maximum most probably corresponds to the most powerful isolated point source on the scan .",
    "the position and value of this maximum give us the location @xmath37 and the amplitude @xmath38 ( eq[13 ] ) of this source .",
    "after that , we construct the field @xmath62 without this point source :    @xmath63    the contribution from this source to the field and its interference with other sources is now removed .",
    "this allows us to find more precisely the next highest maximum .",
    "therefore , we apply the same procedure to the field @xmath62 and find @xmath64 , @xmath65 and so on ( fig.5 ) .",
    "we perform these iterations until the dispersion @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) becomes significantly smaller then @xmath68 ( fig.6 ) .",
    "the total number of iterations that is needed to significantly reduce the initial dispersion gives us approximately the number of point sources @xmath26 and each iteration gives the location @xmath69 and the amplitude @xmath70 of the i - th source .",
    "note , that @xmath71 and roughly speaking , in fig.7 we can see the cumulative distribution of point sources over the power @xmath72 . finally , since we have the position @xmath69 and amplitude @xmath70 , the contribution to the field from all point sources may be removed in the same manner , as was done for a single point source in the previous subsection .",
    "in this section we briefly describe our results in two dimensions . without loss of generality we may consider a small region of the sky and assume that the geometry is approximately flat . under this assumption ,",
    "the part of the detected signal which is determined by the noise associated with @xmath26 point sources can be represented according to the previous section by writing :    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the position of the j - th point source in the cartesian coordinate system and @xmath75 corresponds to the antenna resolution .",
    "analogously to the one - dimensional case , this field should be filtered with some appropriate function .",
    "the convenient filter function @xmath76 that we use in this case is as follows :    @xmath77    according to [ 15,20,21 ] one can write :    @xmath78    therefore , the filtered function @xmath79 at the point @xmath80 has a peak with amplitude equal to the power of j - th point source times the number of modes that we can use for data analysis in the appropriate experiment .    in our simulations of the signal+noise",
    "we use the standard cdm model and background of 100 point sources randomly distributed over the @xmath81 map . without loss of generality",
    "we use the simple symmetric gaussian antenna profile .",
    "all these calculations , of course , could be done for any arbitrary antenna beam . in fig.8",
    "we show the map of the cmb together with the maps of noise , cmb+noise and the filtered map of cmb+noise .",
    "the last one shows us more or less clearly the positions and powers of point sources .",
    "the significant anisotropy that appears in the last map occurs for the following reason . according to formulae",
    "[ 21 ] we use only the set of harmonics @xmath82 , that obey the relation @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the number of horizontal and vertical waves is larger than the number of waves in any other direction .",
    "( this problem does not occur if we use spherical harmonics @xmath84 with @xmath85 ) .",
    "we apply the same iteration technique as in the previous section and therefore separate noise from the cosmological signal ( fig.9 ) .",
    "it is necessary to note that each iteration removes an appropriate point source at the beginning of this process for the most powerful and separated sources . for the weaker sources ,",
    "additional iterations are needed .",
    "the signal from the j - th source decreases as @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the distance from the peak ( in one dimension this dependence is linear ) .",
    "8.5 in -1.5 in    -0 in    this affects the neighboring peaks and can change their amplitudes .",
    "therefore , this approximation works if @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the separation between the i - th and j - th peaks ( the i - th peak is the closest to the j - th peak ) .",
    "otherwise , the amplitudes that have been found in each iteration would not correspond to the powers of the sources and we therefore have to perform a number of iterations that is larger than the number of sources .",
    "in this paper we present a powerful method for extraction of unresolved point sources from future high resolution cmb maps ( such as map , planck , vsa , cbi , dasy , ami and ratan 600 ) .",
    "our method is based on the distribution of phases .",
    "the most important advantage of our technique is that we do not make any strong assumptions about the expected cmb signal as well as about the antenna profile .",
    "most other techniques use the estimated power spectrum of the cmb and noise before the data analysis is implemented ( e.g. wiener filter ) or they require special assumptions about the antenna profile ( e.g. , wavelets techniques ) .",
    "it is worth stressing that , for example , assumptions about the cmb power spectrum can lead to incorrect interpretations of the observational data .",
    "roughly speaking , by making such assumptions , one runs the risk of generating the result one wants and any discrepancies are consider to be errors .",
    "our algorithm is numerically very efficient .",
    "it is a linear algorithm and requires @xmath90 operations , where n is the number of pixels .",
    "therefore it can be easily applied to the analysis of large data sets .",
    "we have demonstrated the accuracy which can be achieved using our algorithm to remove the contribution from point sources on all scales .",
    "we believe that this technique is potentially a very powerful tool for extracting this type of noise from future high resolution maps .",
