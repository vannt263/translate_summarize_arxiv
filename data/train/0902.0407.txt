    "field configurations with the properties of a metastable relativistic string arise in a number of models@xcite .",
    "such string can be viewed as having two phases , 1 and 2 , with their respective tensions @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and the larger tension @xmath0 corresponding to the ` upper ' metastable phase 1 .",
    "the transition to the lower phase with @xmath2 is inhibited by the energy ( mass ) @xmath3 associated with the interface between the two phases .",
    "the transition from the upper to the lower phase proceeds , similarly to the decay of false vacuum@xcite through formation in the initial string 1 of a gap spanned by the phase 2 and subsequent expansion of the gap occupied by the lower phase . clearly , the classical expansion of such gap is possible only starting from a finite critical length of the gap @xmath4 at which length the energy loss due to the mass of the two ends of the gap is compensated by the gain due to the phase energy difference @xmath5 .",
    "a situation , where the string completely breaks up , such as e.g. a breakup of a qcd string with formation of a heavy quark - antiquark pair at the ends , can be viewed as the @xmath6 limit of a two - phase string .    the nucleation of the critical gap is a tunneling process , which can be analyzed in terms of the low energy dynamics of such string which dynamics can be described by the effective nambu - goto action s=_1",
    "a_1 + _ 2 a_2 + m p , [ nga ] where @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is the space - time area of the world sheet occupied by the phase 1 ( resp .",
    "2 ) , and @xmath9 is the space - time length of the interface between the two phases .",
    "the action ( [ nga ] ) applies at the length scales much larger than any scale for the internal structure of the string or of the interface , which typically is the thickness of the string .",
    "using this effective action the calculation of the probability of the decay of the metastable phase is quite similar to the treatment of false vacuum decay in the so - called thin wall approximation@xcite , and its exponential power has been calculated@xcite as well as the pre - exponential factor@xcite .",
    "the rate @xmath10 of spontaneous nucleation of critical gaps per unit length per unit time in a string living in @xmath11 space - time dimensions is given by _",
    "0=f^d-2 _ 1 - _ 2 2 ( - m^2 _ 1 - _ 2 )  , [ g0 ] where @xmath12 is a dimensionless function of the ratio @xmath13 , smoothly varying from @xmath14 at @xmath15 to @xmath16 at @xmath17 .",
    "the excitations of the string , described by the action ( [ nga ] ) are massless goldstone bosons corresponding to transverse waves on the string .",
    "one can reasonably expect on general grounds that the presence of such waves in an excited state of the metastable phase catalyzes its decay .",
    "this catalytic effect of the goldstone excitations gives rise to the recently calculated@xcite thermal enhancement of the decay rate .",
    "it can be noted that the massless goldstone modes are present in a thermal state at arbitrary low temperature @xmath18 , so that the thermal effect expands in powers of @xmath18 .",
    "in particular the leading at low @xmath18 behavior of the catalysis factor @xmath19 in the thermal decay rate @xmath20 is given by k=1 + ( d-2 ) ^8 450 ( _ 1-_2 3 _ 1-_2 ) ^2 ()^8 + o  , [ klow ] and the expansion parameter is @xmath21 , i.e. the ratio of the size of the critical gap to the typical thermal wavelength , beyond which point the treatment in ref.@xcite is not applicable . ] .    in this paper",
    "we consider the destruction of the metastable phase of the string by collisions of the goldstone bosons .",
    "we find that this problem in fact can be solved using appropriate interpretation and extension of the thermal treatment . indeed , the enhancement of the decay rate , described by the factor @xmath19 , is nothing else than the contribution of the production of the critical gap in collisions of the bosons that are present in the thermal bath . in particular , we find that the first temperature dependent term in the expansion ( [ klow ] ) is entirely due to the process of the critical gap creation in collision of two particles in the limit , where their center of mass energy @xmath22 is much smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "we further consider a modification of the approach of ref.@xcite by formally introducing a negative chemical potential for the bosons , and considering the decay of such a thermal state .",
    "this allows to separate the contribution of @xmath24-boson collisions with different @xmath24 in all terms of the expansion in the temperature , and thus to find the dependence of the critical gap production in those collisions for an arbitrary relation between @xmath25 and the energy of the bosons .",
    "one of the results of our consideration is that the string destruction takes place only in collisions of even number of bosons and is absent at odd @xmath24 . by performing a full calculation",
    "we find an explicit expression for the ( dimensionless ) probability @xmath26 of the critical gap creation in two - boson collisions at arbitrary values of the parameter @xmath27 .",
    "our final result for this process has especially simple form for the decay of the string into ` nothing ' i.e. at @xmath28 : w_2=2 ^2 _ c^2 _ 0 ^2  , [ w20 ] with @xmath29 being the standard modified bessel function of the third order .",
    "although in the end we make no assumption about the value of @xmath30 , our treatment in the present paper is limited by the condition e^2 _ 1  , [ econd ] so that the exponential growth of the energy dependent factor in eq.([w20 ] ) ( and in subsequent more general expressions ) does not overcome the exponential suppression in the factor @xmath10 , described by eq.([g0 ] ) .    unlike the thermal factor @xmath19 , which is singular@xcite at @xmath31",
    ", the two - boson production rate does not exhibit any singularity at any value of the parameter @xmath32 , and we find similar smooth energy behavior for @xmath24-boson processes as well .",
    "we thus conclude that the ` explosion ' of the thermal rate at @xmath31 is a result of infinite number of processes becoming important at this point , rather than due to a finite set of processes with a limited range of @xmath24 developing large probability at the energy per particle of the order of @xmath23 .",
    "the rest of the material in this paper is organized as follows . in the section 2",
    "we present a brief account of the euclidean space - time calculation of the string transition , and describe some general properties of the processes of string destruction by particle collisions following from their relation to the absorption in the forward scattering amplitudes . in the section 3",
    "we discuss the interpretation of the thermal catalysis of the string transition as induced by collisions of particles in the thermal state , and we derive from the first term of the low - temperature expansion in eq.([klow ] ) the low - energy limit of the two - particle string destruction probability @xmath26 .",
    "the section 4 describes the extension of the finite temperature analysis by introduction of a negative chemical potential , which allows to identify the contribution to the catalysis factor of the string destruction by individual @xmath24-particle collisions .",
    "the derived general expression is then used in the section 5 to find the two - particle probability @xmath26 in all orders in the parameter @xmath30 .",
    "finally , the section 6 contains a discussion and summary of the results of the present paper .",
    "in complete analogy with the false vacuum decay@xcite , the calculation of the string decay rate@xcite can be performed entirely in terms of euclidean path integration . considering the string in the metastable phase 1 of large length @xmath33 extended along the @xmath34 axis with the ends fixed at @xmath35 and the transverse coordinates @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) fixed at zero at the ends of the string , @xmath38",
    ", one needs to calculate the euclidean path integral @xmath39 over the string variables with the action ( [ nga ] ) around the bounce configuration , i.e. a configuration involving a patch of the phase 2 . the decay probability in the full space - time area of the world sheet",
    "is then given by the expression w_0 = 2 i m z_b _ 0 [ zrat ] with @xmath40 being the path integral calculated around the ` flat ' configuration of the string 1 , i.e. over the configuration without the patch of the lower phase .",
    "for the spontaneous decay and the thermally enhanced decay ( at @xmath41 ) the patch has the shape of a disk with the radius r=_c 2 = m _ 1-_2  .",
    "[ rc ] the action on the bounce , relative to the unperturbed string , is equal to @xmath42 and determines the exponential power for the spontaneous decay rate in eq.([g0 ] ) and also for all the processes discussed in the present paper .",
    "the only difference between the calculation of the decay at finite temperature @xmath18 and at @xmath43 arises at the level of calculating the pre - exponential factor due to the functional determinant of the quadratic part of the action and amounts to the standard treatment of the boundary conditions in ( euclidean ) time for the fluctuations : zero boundary conditions at large time for considering zero temperature and periodic boundary conditions with period @xmath44 at finite temperature .",
    "the formula ( [ zrat ] ) is in fact the unitarity relation@xcite between the decay rate and the imaginary part of the amplitude of the transition amplitude from the false vacuum to the false vacuum @xmath45 .",
    "similarly , one can treat the probability of the string breakup by an excited state in terms of the bounce contribution to the imaginary part of its forward scattering amplitude .",
    "proceeding to discussion of the string decay induced by the goldstone bosons , we readily notice that a state with just one goldstone boson can not induce the destruction of the string . indeed , the total probability of such induced process is lorentz invariant and thus can depend only on the ( lorentz ) square of the particle momentum @xmath46 .",
    "the goldstone bosons are massless , so that for them @xmath47 and is fixed .",
    "thus if a single massless boson produced an effect on the decay , this effect would have no dependence on the energy @xmath48 of the boson . in the limit @xmath49 the goldstone boson is indistinguishable from the vacuum .",
    "( in other words , the limit @xmath49 corresponds to an overall shift of the string in transverse direction . )",
    "thus the decay rate of a single - boson state is the same as that of the vacuum , and the presence of a single boson with any energy produces no effect .",
    "the simplest excited state , contributing to the string destruction , is that with two particles .",
    "the probability @xmath26 of creation of the critical gap in a collision of two particles with two - momenta @xmath50 and @xmath51 can depend only on the lorentz invariant @xmath52 . obviously , for two particles colliding on a string one has @xmath53 ( and @xmath54 for two particles moving in the same direction , i.e. non - colliding ) . using the unitarity relation this probability",
    "can be found in terms of the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude @xmath55 : w_2 = c i m a(k_1,k_2;k_1,k_2 ) _ 1 _ 2   [ w2u ] where the factor @xmath56 is the usual flux factor , and the constant @xmath57 does not depend on either of the energies , and is determined by specific convention about the normalization of the amplitude .",
    "the dynamics of the goldstone bosons on the string , including their scattering , can be considered in terms of the transverse shift @xmath58 treated as a two - dimensional field and described by the nambu - goto action ( [ nga ] ) as s=_1 _",
    "a_1 d^2x + _ 2 _ a_2 d^2 x + m _ p dl  , [ ngg ] where @xmath59 is the element of the length of the interface @xmath9 between the phases .    clearly at low energy of the goldstone bosons",
    "one can make use of the expansion in eq.([ngg ] ) in powers of @xmath60 which generates the expansion of the scattering amplitudes in the momenta of the particles with each one entering the amplitude with ( at least ) one power of its energy @xmath48 , as is mandatory for goldstone bosons .",
    "for the scattering in the metastable state this generates expansion in powers of @xmath61 , so that in the zeroth order in this ratio , that we are discussing here , it is sufficient to retain only the quadratic in @xmath60 terms in the action ( [ ngg ] ) . it should be noted that in spite of retaining only the quadratic terms , the multi - boson scattering amplitudes do not vanish , since the necessary nonlinearity arises from the bounce configuration . in other words ,",
    "the bosons scatter ` through the bounce ' .",
    "the energy expansion for these amplitudes is determined by the bounce scale @xmath25 , so that the parameter of such expansion is @xmath62 , and we do not assume this parameter to be small .",
    "clearly , the condition for applicability of the present approach where the terms of order @xmath61 are dropped , while those with the parameter @xmath63 are retained is that 1-_2 _ 1  , [ condr ] which is always true if the semiclassical tunneling can be applied at all to the string decay .",
    "we shall now show that in the on - shell scattering through the bounce each external leg enters with at least two powers of its energy .",
    "let us start , for the simplicity of illustration , with the binary scattering .",
    "the general two @xmath64 two scattering amplitude @xmath65 can be related in the standard application of the reduction formula to the connected 4-point green s function @xmath66 , which in turn is an analytical continuation of the euclidean connected correlator | z(x_1 ) z(x_2 ) z(x_3 ) z(x_4 ) | vacuum  1 = z_0 ^ -1 ^4 z_b[j ]",
    "j(x_1 ) j(x_2 ) j(x_3 ) j(x_4 ) .",
    "[ zj ] the latter expression for the correlator implicitly assumes the conventional procedure of introducing in the action the source term @xmath67 for the goldstone variable @xmath68 , which is equivalent to considering just one transverse dimension , i.e. @xmath69 . ] , and @xmath70 $ ] is the path integral around the bounce in the presence of the source .",
    "[ 4_source ]    the low - energy limit of the on - shell scattering amplitude is determined by the correlator at widely separated points @xmath71 .",
    "the weak @xmath72- function sources ` prop ' the string in the transverse direction at those points as shown in figure  1 , and generally distort the bounce located between the sources .",
    "the correlator ( [ zj ] ) is determined by the distortion of the bounce by all four sources , so that at large separation between the points the bounce is located far ( in the scale of its size @xmath25 ) from the sources , where the overall distortion of the world sheet for the string is small and is slowly varying on the scale @xmath25 .",
    "one can therefore expand the background field @xmath73 generated by the sources at the bounce location in the taylor series around an arbitrarily chosen inside the bounce point @xmath74 .",
    "clearly the first term of this expansion @xmath75 corresponds to an overall transverse shift of the string and does not alter the bounce shape and the action .",
    "moreover , the linear term in this expansion , proportional to the gradient @xmath76 , does not change the bounce action either .",
    "indeed this term corresponds to a linear incline of the string in the transverse coordinates , and can be eliminated by an overall rotation of the string in the @xmath11 dimensional space . in other words",
    "the absence of the linear in the gradient of @xmath73 term in the action is a direct consequence of the @xmath11-dimensional lorentz invariance of the string .",
    "we thus arrive at the conclusion that the expansion for the distortion of the bounce starts from the second order in the derivatives of @xmath73 ( the curvature of the background world sheet ) , which for a connected correlator implies that in the expansion in the energy each external source enters with at least two powers of the energy .",
    "this conclusion clearly applies to the on - shell amplitudes with arbitrary number of external legs , since the generalization to multiparticle scattering is straightforward .",
    "in particular , the binary scattering amplitude @xmath65 at low energy scales as the eighth power of the energy .",
    "it the follows from eq.([w2u ] ) that the probability of the string destruction by collision of two particles is proportional to the sixth power of the energy scale , or equivalently , to @xmath77 at small @xmath78 .",
    "applying in the same manner the unitarity condition to the forward scattering amplitude of a general @xmath24-particle state , one readily concludes that the corresponding probability @xmath79 of the induced string breakup scales with the overall energy scale @xmath48 as @xmath80 .",
    "the described procedure for calculating the bounce - induced scattering amplitudes in terms of the euclidean correlators runs into the technical difficulty of calculating the bounce distortion in the background created by the sources .",
    "furthermore , this procedure obviously involves a great redundancy , if the final purpose is a calculation of the probabilities @xmath79 , i.e. only the absorptive parts of the forward scattering on - shell amplitudes are the quantities of interest .",
    "we find that in fact one can directly derive the probabilities @xmath79 by an appropriate interpretation of the more readily calculable thermal decay rate in terms of the collision - induced probabilities .",
    "such an approach is technically more tractable due to the fact that in the thermal calculation the bounce is not distorted , i.e. it is still a flat disk , and only the boundary conditions for the modes of the fluctuations are modified .",
    "we first illustrate this approach by using the first nontrivial term of the low temperature expansion in eq.([klow ] ) for a calculation of the low energy limit of the binary probability @xmath26 .    indeed , the temperature dependent factors in the catalysis factor @xmath19 arise from the critical gap nucleation in boson collisions weighed with the thermal number density distribution for the massless goldstone bosons dn(k ) = 1 e^/t - 1 d k 2  , [ bose ] where @xmath81 is the spatial momentum , @xmath82 , running from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "given the low energy behavior @xmath85 found in the previous section , one readily concludes that the contribution of @xmath24-particle string destruction starts with the term @xmath86 in the low @xmath18 expansion for @xmath19 .",
    "thus the first term written in eq.([klow ] ) can arise only from @xmath87 , i.e. from the production of the critical gap in binary collisions . writing the expansion in @xmath78 for the probability @xmath26 as @xmath88",
    ", one determines the coefficient @xmath89 of the @xmath77 term by comparing the result in eq.([klow ] ) with the one calculated in terms of the two - particle collision rate using the number density distribution ( [ bose ] ) : & & ( d-2 ) _ 0 ^8 450 ( _ 1-_2 3 _ 1-_2 ) ^2 ()^8 = + & & ( d-2 ) c_3 _ 0^ _ 0^ s^3 4 ^2 = ( d-2 ) c_3 16 ^6 225 t^8  , [ w2low ] where the relation @xmath53 is used and the integration is done only for the bosons with opposite signs of their momenta , and avoiding the double - counting for identical particles .",
    "the factor @xmath90 counting the number of the transverse dimensions , corresponds to the summation over the polarizations of the goldstone bosons .",
    "the expression for the coefficient @xmath89 following from eq.([w2low ] ) thus determines the first term in the expansion for @xmath26 w_2=_0 r^2  .",
    "[ w2l1 ] ( one can notice that at @xmath28 the @xmath77 term coincides with the first term of expansion of the expression in eq.([w20 ] ) . )",
    "the discussed procedure for extracting the coefficients of the energy expansion for the probability of collision - induced string decay is obviously limited to only the first term in @xmath26 . in the higher terms in the temperature expansion for @xmath19 the contribution of the energy expansion for @xmath79 with different @xmath24 generally gets entangled .",
    "this happens because the temperature is the only parameter and terms originating from different @xmath24 can contribute in the same power in @xmath18 . in order to disentangle the terms of higher order in the energy in @xmath79 with low @xmath24 from similar terms originating from higher @xmath24",
    "we introduce a _ negative _ chemical potential @xmath91 for the goldstone bosons .",
    "generally , such procedure would no be possible , since the number of these bosons is not conserved .",
    "however in our application this procedure is fully legitimate .",
    "indeed , the thermal state of the string that we study here is that of _ collisionless _ bosons , in which their number _ is _ conserved .",

    "fortunately , this modification is quite straightforward , and we describe it here by first briefly recapitulating the relevant part of that previous work , where further details can be readily found .    the bounce configuration is a disk of the radius @xmath93 , and we place the origin of the string world sheet coordinates in the euclidean space - time @xmath94 at the center of the bounce .",

    "this expression is especially simple for @xmath132 , i.e. for the case of the string decay into ` nothing ' : @xmath133 , so that one arrives at the formula ( [ w20 ] ) .",
    "we also write here , for an illustration , the corresponding expressions for the next two integer values of @xmath129 : _ 2(x)=1 x ;   _",
    "3(x)=1 x^2  .",
    "one can readily evaluate the sum in eq.([phib ] ) at large @xmath34 by using the stirling formula for the factorials , and find that independently of @xmath129 the function behaves as an exponent : @xmath134 .",
    "this corresponds to an exponential behavior of the probability @xmath26 at large @xmath135 . in combination with the exponential factor in @xmath10",
    "this behavior can be written as w_2(s ) ~ ( - m^2 _",
    "1-_2 + 2 m _",
    "[ w2ex ] clearly , the energy growth of the probability never overcomes the large negative power due to the tunneling . indeed , due to the condition @xmath136 for the semiclassical approximation to be valid at all and the condition @xmath137 for the validity of our approach based on neglecting direct interactions between the goldstone bosons , one always has @xmath138 .",
    "it can be also noted that the power series for @xmath128 converges for any value of @xmath34 , so that the probability @xmath127 has no singularity at any @xmath78 .",
    "the same conclusion also holds for the probabilities @xmath79 at any @xmath24 .",
    "indeed , each term of order @xmath139 with a specific power @xmath24 in the expansion ( [ dexp ] ) is described by an absolutely convergent series in the energy parameters .",
    "this implies that the reason for the singularity@xcite at @xmath140 of the thermal factor @xmath19 in eq.([kfull ] ) is not that some finite set of collision processes gives a singular contribution , but rather that at this point an infinite multitude of processes becomes important .    in summary .",
    "we have considered the processes in which collisions of the goldstone bosons on a metastable string induce its destruction by creating a critical gap of the stable phase with lower tension .",
    "it has been shown that at energy that is much smaller than the scale set by the tension @xmath0 of the string the interaction of the goldstone bosons in the bulk of the string can be neglected , and the discussed processes proceed ` through the bounce ' , which interaction mechanism has the scale set by the length @xmath25 of the critical gap .",
    "we have demonstrated that when the energy scale @xmath48 in a collision is much smaller than @xmath23 the probability @xmath79 of the string destruction in an @xmath24 particle collision is proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "in particular the low - energy expression for @xmath26 is determined from our previous result for the string decay at finite temperature . in order to calculate the probability for an arbitrary relation between the energy scale and @xmath25",
    "we have extended the calculation of the thermal decay rate by formally introducing a negative chemical potential for the bosons . the dependence of the resulting string decay rate on the chemical potential and the temperature allows to separate the contribution to this rate of individual @xmath24-particle collision processes . in other words ,",
    "the expression ( [ dexp ] ) provides a generating function for the probabilities @xmath79 .",
    "it turns out that collisions of any odd number of the goldstone bosons do not lead at all to the string destruction and this process occurs only in collisions of an even number of particles . as an application of the general formulas",
    "we have calculated explicitly the probability of destruction of the string in a two - particle collision as a function of their c.m .",
    "energy @xmath142 .",
    "the found expression exhibits an exponential growth at large values of the product @xmath143 , however within the validity of the approximations used in the present treatment this growth never compensates the overall semiclassical exponential suppression of the string decay .",
