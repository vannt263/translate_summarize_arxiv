    "determining stellar ages is notoriously difficult , but they are becoming increasingly important in the field of exoplanetary science as a stepping stone to a better understanding of the evolution of planetary systems . in order to fully characterize the time - scales involved in processes such as planet formation and destruction , orbital migration and circularization , and intra - system dynamical interactions , it is vital that we are able to accurately assess the ages of exoplanet host stars .",
    "a wide range of methods exist for the evaluation of stellar age , making use of a disparate array of phenomena .",
    "two that are particularly prevalent in the exoplanet literature are gyrochronology and isochrone fitting .",
    "stellar model fitting , also known as isochrone fitting , is widely used owing to its relative ease of implementation .",
    "traditionally , either absolute stellar magnitude , @xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or stellar surface gravity , @xmath2 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is interpolated through theoretical models of stellar evolution along with the stellar effective temperature , @xmath3 .",
    "however for exoplanetary studies it has become common practice to replace @xmath1 and @xmath2 with the cube root of the stellar density , as this can be constrained to high precision through transit photometry .",
    "this leads to a parameter space of [ @xmath4 @xcite .    in principle ,",
    "isochrone fitting is applicable to stars across the spectral range , but it can be difficult to determine ages for stars with spectral type later than mid - to - late g owing to the fact that they evolve very slowly , having nuclear burning time - scales that are longer than the age of the galactic disc .",
    "the complex shape of isochrones close to the main - sequence ( ms ) turn - off can also pose problems , and linearly interpolating through isochrones is not always a valid approach owing to their non - uniform spacing @xcite .",
    "gyrochronology is a method for determining a cool star s age through measurement of its rotation period and colour , and arose from observations showing that by the age of the hyades the rotation of stars in stellar clusters tends to converge to a single period ",
    "colour  age relation . first suggested by @xcite ,",
    "it builds on the simple relationship between rotation period and age described by @xcite to provide a model - independent alternative to age estimation methods that require distance measurements for the stars under examination .",
    "subsequent development of the method in @xcite showed that gyrochronology provides age estimate that are more self - consistent than those derived through isochrone fitting .",
    "it has been demonstrated that , if rotation periods have been measured and the equations correctly calibrated , gyrochronology can provide ages with an accuracy of 10percent for f , g , k , and m spectral types @xcite .",
    "one drawback with the method is that it assumes that the natural rotational evolution of the star progresses free from any outside influence .",
    "this is not always the case ; in both binary star systems and hot jupiter exoplanetary systems , tidal torques between nearby bodies in close proximity can potentially overwhelm the natural spin - down that results from magnetic braking , at least for short periods of time .",
    "in addition , gyrochronology is not calibrated for hot , rapidly rotating , early - type stars , and is only limited to ` solar - type ( fgkm ) stars ' @xcite . as transit searches prioritize stars of f or g spectral type ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * for wasp targets ) ; ( * ? ? ? * for _ kepler _ targets ) ) , this is not particularly limiting , but @xcite suggests that gyrochronology may not always provide accurate age estimates for planetary systems .",
    "@xcite found that plotting @xmath5 as a function of @xmath3 for planet - hosting stars gives a poor fit to the period  colour relation of @xcite , and that the rotation periods of hot jupiter hosts were , on average , a factor of @xmath6 faster than non - planet - hosting stars ; such a discrepancy would clearly lead to underestimation of the gyrochronology ages of stars with known planets with respect to their true age .    in this work",
    ", i investigate the ages of a sample of planetary systems primarily discovered by transit searches .",
    "i first discuss the methods that i have used to determine the ages of the stars in my sample , before comparing the results obtained using isochrone fitting to those obtained through gyrochronology .",
    "i also investigate the subset of my sample for which the sky - projected spin - orbit alignment angle has been measured , to check for biases in either of the age estimation methods that might be induced in misaligned systems .",
    "i consider a sample of @xmath0 planet - hosting stars with @xmath7k@xmath8k .",
    "these limits were chosen to restrict my sample to spectral types f7g9 ( inclusive ) , and are based on the values given in tableb1 of @xcite .",
    "this restriction on the available parameter space avoids the problems encountered when isochrone fitting for stars with long ms lifetimes , and has an upper limit that coincides with the magnetic braking boundary at mid - to - late f spectral type observed by @xcite .",
    "stars with earlier spectral types than this show little - to - no relation between @xmath9 and age @xcite , and are therefore poor targets for gyrochronology .",
    "the majority of the sample , which is described in table[tab : data ] , consists of the host stars of sub - stellar companions discovered by the wasp project @xcite , with the remaining systems selected from the holt ",

    "@xcite suggests that multiple sets of isochrones should be used if at all possible , in preference to relying on a single formulation , as each model introduces its own systematic errors into the derived stellar parameters .",
    "i selected five sets of stellar models for my analysis : padova isochrones @xcite ; yy isochrones ( @xcite ) ; teramo isochrones @xcite ; victoria - regina isochrones ( vrss ; @xcite ) , and dartmouth stellar evolution database isochrones ( dsed ; @xcite ) .",
    "the main difficulty of isochrone fitting is that it is an attempt to fit a single point to a three - dimensional [ @xmath13 $ ] , @xmath3 , @xmath14 parameter space in order to derive associated parameters ( age and stellar mass ) .",

    ", i use a value of @xmath16 .",
    "there are many possible fitting procedures .",
    "the simplest is to merely take the closest isochrone as the age of the system , but this often provides only crude estimates and has an accuracy that is constrained by the ages for which isochrones have been provided .",
    "a more involved approach would be to find the two closest isochrones and interpolate between them",
    ". another alternative would be the bayesian approach of @xcite .",
    "i have chosen to describe the [ @xmath17 surface to which the stellar data is being fitted , and then to use this description to define a small plane over which i can interpolate the stellar data .",
    "for this purpose , i use a delaunay triangulation , computed for a sub - region of the full isochrone parameter space that is centred on the measured stellar parameters . for details , please see appendix[sec : ages_triangulation ] . uncertainties in my interpolated ages are calculated by interpolating combinations of the @xmath18 limits on both @xmath3 and @xmath19 using the same procedure .",
    "@xcite homogeneously studied large samples of exoplanet host stars , as part of which he carried out age determinations using a range of isochrones that included the yy isochrones .",
    "@xcite uses a more traditional isochrone interpolation method , and as such these papers provide a reasonable comparison to my results .",

    "my results are generally compatible with those of @xcite , although it is immediately apparent that the uncertainties in my ages are smaller .",
    "i suspect that this partly results from @xcite s use of multiple isochrones to determine the systematic contribution to their age uncertainties , inflating their error bars somewhat .",

    "for the majority of the planetary systems in my sample there exists no direct measurement of the stellar rotation period .",
    "i therefore sampled gaussian distributions for the projected stellar rotation @xmath35 , the orbital inclination @xmath36 , and the stellar radius , @xmath37 , @xmath33 times as described above .",

    "nine of the systems in my sample have directly measured rotation periods available . for these systems",
    ", i also calculated the rotation period , allowing me to compare the derived periods to the measured values . in five out of the nine cases ,",
    "the two periods agree , although in the case of wasp-46 this is due to the substantial uncertainty in the derived period . for the remaining three systems ,",
    "the periods disagree by more than @xmath40 .",
    "this is likely due to misalignment of the stellar rotation axis along the line of sight such that @xmath35 is not a good representation of the true rotation speed of the stars involved .",
    "three of the systems for which the two periods disagree have a derived period that is longer than the measured period , supporting the case for a misaligned star .",
    "the exception is wasp-19 , for which the derived period is significantly shorter than the measured period for reasons unknown .",
    "it is also possible that differential rotation in the star has led to the rotation period being measured at a latitude other than the stellar equator .",
    "evidence for differential rotation has in fact been observed for corot-2 @xcite , with possible indications also present for wasp-19 @xcite , but the scale of the effect is insufficient to explain the discrepancy between the measured and derived rotation periods .",
    "misalignment along the line of sight thus seems a more probable explanation for discrepant derived periods among my stellar sample , but without measurements of the stellar inclination the reliability of the derived periods is difficult to ascertain . assuming @xmath41 initially seems reasonable , but it has been shown that some systems will have stellar inclinations such that this assumption is invalid @xcite .    in figure[fig",

    "colour , and _ ( j - k ) _ colour as functions of rotation period , and overplot both the position of the break in the kraft rotation period curve @xcite and relevant relationships between colour and period .",
    "as already noted , my sample is selected on @xmath3 with an upper limit that approximates to the temperature at which the kraft break occurs .",
    "this is clear from the upper panel of figure[fig : colper ] , with only nine systems having uncertainties such that they might lie slightly ` above ' the break .",
    "the location of the break in _ ( j - k ) _ space is also close to the edge of the sample ; five systems appear to have _ ( j - k ) _ colour such that they lie ` above ' the break , though the uncertainties are such that that number could be anywhere between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "but when translated into _ ( b - v ) _ colour space , the kraft break seems to shift within the sample , with three systems displaying lower _ ( b - v ) _ colour index than the position of the break even when uncertainties are accounted for",
    ". however , these three systems are the same as those that were out of place in figure[fig : cmd ] ; checking other sources suggests that the apass calibration for these three stars is likely to be inaccurate , and i therefore exclude them when analysing ages calculated using equation ( [ eq : gyro1 ] ) .",
    "although i have carried out similar analyses for all @xmath44 combinations of the isochrones and gyrochronology relations mentioned above , in the discussion that follows i will concentrate on the results obtained using the yy isochrones and the @xcite gyrochronology formulation described by equation ( [ eq : gyro4 ] ) .",
    "the comparison utilizes only those systems with valid results for both methods .",
    "the maximum permitted age for any star was set to the current best estimate of the age of the universe ( * ? ? ? * and other papers in the series ) , and",
    "systems with calculated ages greater than this were disregarded .",
    "this is perhaps a somewhat unrealistic upper bound ; the age of the galactic disc might be more suitable ( and is thought to be somewhat younger than the universe ) , but introduces its own set of problems .",
    "do the thick and thin discs have the same age , and if not , which should be used ? or should the sample be split up by population , and if so how would that be done ( disc component membership is a difficult attribute to characterize ) ? for simplicity ,",
    "i have stuck to the age of the universe .",
    "the null hypothesis of this work is that the two age calculation methods are equally accurate , and therefore that the ages calculated using the two different methods will agree",
    ". this may not always be true on a case - by - case basis , but when viewed as an overall sample , then agreement is the expected outcome .      as a starting point ,",
    "i plot gyrochronology age as a function of isochrone age .",
    "if the two methods provided similar answers , i would expect a tightly correlated sequence centred on the line @xmath45 ( within errors ) .",
    "however , there appears to be a preponderance of points lying towards the isochronal side of the line , suggesting that isochrone fitting tends to return ages that are older than those preferred by gyrochronological methods .",
    "neglecting uncertainties , there are twice as many systems for which the isochrone age is older than for which the gyrochronology age is older ; this ratio increases once uncertainties are taken into account , in a large part owing to the large uncertainties on my calculated gyrochronology ages . but",
    "the number of systems with error ellipses consistent with equal ages is , at @xmath46 systems , more than half of the @xmath47 systems for which valid ages were returned by both methods .",
    "this is a significant fraction of the sample , and indeed one would hope that this would be the case given the stated null hypothesis . however , the number of systems for which the isochrone age is still greater than the gyrochronology age once the uncertainties are taken into account is @xmath48 , whilst the converse case includes only @xmath11 systems .",
    "another interesting facet of figure[fig : g4vsy ] is the distribution of the points along both axes . just over half of the systems",
    "lie within a region defined by @xmath49gyr and @xmath50gyr .",
    "this is not entirely surprising given the region of parameter space to which i have restricted the study .",
    "rough estimates of @xmath51 for stars at the limit of my parameter space are @xmath52gyr for an f7 star and @xmath53gyr for a g9 star ( using masses from table b1 of @xcite ) . a drop - off after roughly 4 gyr is consistent with this , as systems at the hotter end of the parameter range start to evolve off the ms , and are therefore no longer targeted by transit search programs .",
    "including uncertainties in this analysis lowers the number of systems that are definitively within this high - density region to @xmath54 , with a further @xmath55 which have error ellipses at least partially within this region of parameter space .    in terms of the different methods , @xmath56percent of the gyrochronology estimates",
    "are less than @xmath57gyr , with possible stellar ages ranging from @xmath58gyr up to the age of the universe . for the isochrone - fitting estimates ,",
    "@xmath59percent are younger than @xmath60gyr , with the estimates covering a similar range .",
    "it therefore seems , at first glance , that gyrochronology tends to return stellar age estimates which are slightly biased towards younger ages than the results from isochrone fitting . whilst this conclusion is tempered somewhat by the magnitude of the uncertainties on the ages that i have calculated , particularly for the gyrochronology ages",

    "is it that isochrone fitting is overestimating ages , or that gyrochronology is underestimating ages ( or a combination of the two ) ?",
    "figure[fig : g4vsy ] certainly seems to imply the former , as the systems with measured rotation periods , and thus the most reliable gyrochronology ages , all show a tendency towards an older isochronal age , in some cases with strong significance .",
    "this could be an indication that my new method for determining isochrone ages is overestimating the ages of my systems ; with the comparison sample that is available ( see figure[fig : jktcompare ] ) , it seems that this is not the case on average , although the comparison is very limited in scope . as noted in section[sec : gyro ] though , gyrochronology is only applicable if no external factors act to modify the natural stellar spin - down . if hot jupiter host stars are rotating more rapidly than expected , then their age would be underestimated .",
    "one possibility might be that the spin rate of the star is being modified somehow , and angular momentum exchange between the star and the planet s orbit provides one route by which such a scenario might occur .",

    "it is possible that i have underestimated the systematic contributions , which would increase the overlap between the two age estimation methods , but the magnitude of the systematic effects found by @xcite is in many cases small compared to the uncertainties that i have already derived .",
    "however , there is one substantial source of uncertainty that i have neglected during this work . as i stated in section[sec : isoimp ] , i neglect the uncertainty in metallicity when calculating the age . including this factor would increase the uncertainties on my isochrone ages by up to @xmath153percent , and",
    "could potentially account for the small discrepancy that i see between the two methods . finally , is the delaunay triangulation method that i have implemented producing reliable , consistent age estimates ?",
    "the overlap between my sample and other studies is insufficient for a comprehensive comparison , but figure[fig : jktcompare ] suggests that the method is working well  further investigation is required though .",
    "a related possibility is that the stellar parameters i am using are poorly determined . for the stellar density , this is unlikely , as planetary transits allow the density of the host star to be obtained directly from the light curve .",
    "however , @xmath3 is usually determined from stellar spectra , but for transiting planet discoveries said spectra are not necessarily of very high resolution , leading to potential inaccuracy and imprecision in the temperature determinations .",
    "the second potential explanation for the discrepancy is that gyrochronology is underestimating the ages of the stars in my sample .",
    "the study of @xmath166 stars with planets by @xcite , with a comparison sample of @xmath167 stars without detected planets , found that stars with planets tended to have greater angular momentum at a given mass than stars without planets .",
    "the difference was most pronounced in stars with @xmath168 , and the stars with the most massive planets were found to have the greatest angular momenta relative to the sun .",
    "this would seem to suggest that angular momentum exchange as a result of tidal action could be responsible for the discrepancy in age results .",
    "the increase in the angular momentum of a star with one or more planets would in turn decrease its rotation period compared to a star without planets , throwing off the gyrochronology calibration which is carried out using stellar cluster members which have no known companions .",
    "but this is at odds with my own findings in section[sec : age_tides ] , where there seemed to be no correlation between the tidal time - scale and the difference between the methods .",
    "another finding of @xcite was that stars with planets definitely follow the established relation between rotation and mass that was described by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they carried out ks tests on the @xmath169 distributions of their two samples ( stars with and without planets ) , finding that the results were inconsistent with different origins .",
    "it is important here to again consider the rotation periods that i have used .",
    "i have assumed throughout this work that the derived rotation periods are generally reliable , based on the analysis in section[sec : gyroimp ] . assuming that the derived periods are all incorrect leaves an insufficiently large sample for firm conclusions to be drawn , particularly given the magnitude of the uncertainties in some cases .",
    "in addition , the gyrochronology relations that i have used may not be calibrated very well for the ages of the stars that i am using .",
    "gyrochronology is generally calibrated using young , open stellar cluster data owing to the large samples of stars with the same age that such data sets provide . however , this is a very different region of parameter space to that occupied by the majority of exoplanet host stars , which tend to be field stars and older in age ( as demonstrated by my results ) .",
    "there is therefore no guarantee that the same gyrochronology equations will be valid ; efforts to recalibrate gyrochronology for exoplanet hosts using _ kepler _",
    "data are ongoing ( angus et al .",
    ", in preparation ) , the results of which could have strong implications for this work .",
    "a third possibility is that both methods are inaccurate to some degree , and that there are cases for which both can be considered to be the better option .",
    "although extreme systems such as wasp-19 might be undergoing spin - up that is leading to an underestimation of their gyrochronology age , they seem to be in the minority .",
    "i also note that even without tidal spin - up it was impossible to replicate the isochronal age of wasp-19 using gyrochronology . on the other hand , the planets in stellar clusters that i considered demonstrate problems with both age estimation methods .",
    "@xcite conducted a study of exoplanet host star ages with similar motivation to this work .",
    "they focused on estimating age through the use of the chromospheric activity indicator , @xmath170 , but also compared their results to the age as calculated using isochrone fitting , lithium abundance , metallicity , and kinematics . using a sample of over 100 systems",
    ", they found that isochrone ages tended to be older than chromospheric ages , both for their exoplanet host sample and a sample of solar - neighbourhood stars , regardless of which calibration was used for the chromospheric results .",
    "they caution though that the dispersions on the two distributions are such that the difference could be nullified .",
    "this provides an interesting comparison to the work presented herein .",
    "chromospheric activity is known to be correlated with stellar rotation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "unfortunately , @xcite provide no suggestion for the source of the discrepancy , merely pointing out that the characteristics of the various methods that they use inherently limit them to certain age ranges .",
    "but the broad similarity between my results and those of @xcite is encouraging , even if it provides little additional evidence as to which of the age estimation methods is performing poorly .    extending my analysis to compare chromospheric ages with the methods that i have already considered",
    "would seem an obvious next step for my investigation of exoplanet host star ages , but chromospheric activity is often poorly dealt with by exoplanet studies .",
    "the number of planet - hosting stars for which measurements of @xmath171 are available is substantially fewer than the number of planetary systems . in many cases",
    "either only a qualitative description is given , or no mention is made of activity in the star .",
    "the values that are available are often derived only from single observations , or from observations covering only a short time span ( such as the duration of a transit ) .",
    "given that chromospheric emission often varies periodically , and can do so by significant but unknown factors , makes assessment of stellar age using these data quite inaccurate .",
    "there have been studies specifically looking at this metric ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but more work is needed .    in future it may be possible to reconcile the differences between gyrochronology and isochrone fitting with additional data .",
    "additional measurements of stellar rotation periods for planet - hosting stars will allow improved gyrochronology estimates by avoiding the systematic errors that are introduced through the use of derived periods , while more precise measurements of stellar parameters such as mass , radius , density , and effective temperature will produce improvements in the results from isochrone fitting .",
    "asteroseismology could also directly improve our age estimates , particularly for older stars for which isochrone fitting can struggle , but will require extensive telescope and analysis time , and relies on the same isochrones as isochrone fitting @xcite .",

    "i have shown that there seems to be a small , global discrepancy between the results that are produced by the two methods .",
    "this may be linked to stellar effective temperature , with isochrone fitting acting to overestimate the age of the stars in my sample .",
    "examination of planetary systems in stellar clusters , or of the planetary systems for which the stellar rotation period has been measured , suggests that this might be the case , but for the broader sample the possibility that it is a selection effect can not be ruled out .",

    "delaunay triangulation is a particular method for creating a triangular mesh for a set of data points .",

    "i have used the implementation of j. bernal ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "first , it avoids distorted triangles by maximizing the minimum angle within the triangulation .",
    "secondly , no data other than the vertices of a given triangle may lie within its circumcircle .",
    "thirdly , for any pair of triangles , the sum of the angles opposite to their common side must be less than @xmath173 .",
    "if a pair of triangles does not fulfil this third criterion , then swapping the common side such that it bisects those angles creates a delaunay pair ( figure[fig : ages_dtswap ] ) . as each datum",
    "is added to the triangulation , the new triangles that are created are checked for delaunay compliance , and modified if necessary using this procedure .    , represents the measured stellar data .",
    "the triangulation is computed such that the minimum angle across all of the triangles produced is as large as possible .",

    "i identify the component of the triangulation that encloses the measured parameters , and linearly interpolate through the selected triangle using the centroid - based method of @xcite to identify the age that would be associated with a model datum at the same location as the measured parameters .",
    "the ` centroid ' of a triangle lies at the intersection of the lines joining the triangles vertices to the midpoints of their opposing sides ( see figure[fig : centroid ] ) . by definition",
    ", it is the point where the areas @xmath177 , @xmath178 , and @xmath179 are equal , and it s coordinates are given by    @xmath180    by extension , any point in the plane defined by the triangles vertices can be defined as a linear combination of these vertices , with coefficients that sum to unity :    @xmath181    for any given point , the coefficients ( weights ) can be determined using the areas of the plane and of the three component triangles :    @xmath182    since the [ @xmath17 coordinates for the vertices of the triangle enclosing the measured parameters are known , it is trivial to calculate these weights .",
    "the ages known to correspond to the same vertices can then be used alongside the weights to calculate the age corresponding to the measured parameters using equation ( [ eq : datum ] ) .",
    "this method provides a unique solution , as the three vertices of the triangle define a unique plane in three dimensions @xcite .    ,",
    "@xmath183 , and @xmath184 , the black circles , are the vertices of the triangle that has been selected from figure[fig : ages_dt ] as containing the measured stellar parameters , which are found at point @xmath174 , the blue square .",
    "@xmath185 is the ` centroid ' of the selected triangle .",
    "each vertex is given a weight according to the ratio of the areas of the component triangles ( @xmath186 , @xmath187 , and @xmath188 ) to the area of the enclosing triangle ( @xmath189 ) .",
    "these weights are then used to interpolate the age at @xmath174 according to equation ( [ eq : datum]).,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the specific property of the delaunay triangulation to maximize the minimum angle of all triangles is particularly important in this context , as the isochrone data are not distributed uniformly in [ @xmath17 parameter space .",
    "making the triangles as equiangular as possible helps with the interpolation process , as it decreases the chance that two vertices will share an age .",
    "uncertainties in the calculated age are determined by following the same interpolation procedure using data corresponding to eight points around the error ellipse .",
    "these are the extremes of the error bars on @xmath3 and @xmath19 , and the points at @xmath190 between the error bars .",
    "the shape of the isochrones and evolutionary tracks is such that simply using the error bars can underestimate the uncertainty in the age ; using the intermediate points helps to alleviate this .",
    "stellar effective temperatures for the sample were taken from references containing the most recent spectroscopic analyses .",
    "stellar densities were taken from the most recent analyses of the relevant planetary systems ( at time of writing ) ; directly listed values were used preferentially , otherwise the density was calculated using the stellar mass and radius .",
