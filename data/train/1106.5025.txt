    "one of the fundamental topics in the physics of the strong interaction is the investigation of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "lattice gauge theory provides a powerful tool for dealing with the thermodynamics of qcd .",
    "however , lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations are not feasible at real values ( @xmath2 ) of the quark chemical potential(s ) , at least not for @xmath3 at given temperature @xmath4 , because of the well - known sign problem .",
    "explorations into the domain of large @xmath2 , or high baryon densities , can so far only be pursued in terms of models , a frequently used one being the polyakov - loop - extended nambu and jona - lasinio ( pnjl ) model  @xcite .",
    "such approaches have obvious intrinsic limitations .",
    "( for example , important constraints well known from nuclear physics around and above normal nuclear matter densities are not ( yet ) realistically incorporated in such models ) .",
    "their predictive power concerning possible phase transitions at high baryon densities is quite limited and involves substantial ambiguities at finite @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "setting additional constraints for the modeling of qcd phases at nonzero chemical potentials is therefore an important issue .    under such circumstances ,",
    "the continuation from real to imaginary chemical potential turns out to be a useful conceptual strategy . in this case",
    "lqcd simulations do not face the sign problem ; there is no principal restriction in performing lqcd computations in the region of imaginary chemical potentials .",
    "models formally designed for general complex chemical potentials , @xmath5 can then interpolate between positive and negative @xmath6 and incorporate lqcd constraints set at imaginary @xmath7 into extrapolations to the physical region of real @xmath7 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath0 is apparent in the connection between the grand canonical partition function , @xmath8 , written for imaginary chemical potential in terms of the dimensionless ratio @xmath9 , and the canonical partition function @xmath10 expressed as a function of quark number @xmath11 : @xmath12 inverting this fourier transform gives the grand partition function at finite @xmath2 through the fugacity expansion as @xmath13 where the thermodynamical limit is considered , with the three - dimensional volume set to @xmath14 .",
    "several important features are noteworthy in the @xmath0 region ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "first , the qcd partition function has a @xmath15 periodicity along the @xmath16 axis , the roberge - weiss ( rw ) periodicity  @xcite .",
    "another characteristic property is the rw transition : thermodynamical quantities and order parameters have nonanalytic behavior at @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 an odd integer ) once the temperature exceeds a specific value , @xmath19 .",
    "this point , @xmath20 , is the so - called rw endpoint .",
    "these nonanalyticities are induced by the transition between different minima of the thermodynamical potential ( see fig .  2 in ref .",
    "moreover , the imaginary chemical potential is gauged into the temporal boundary condition of quarks ; the dual quark condensate  @xcite is then proposed as a measure for exploring the possible correlation between the chiral and the deconfinement transitions .",
    "this correlation was also studied previously in terms of a ginzburg - landau analysis  @xcite .    in recent years",
    "several lqcd investigations at imaginary chemical potentials have been performed in order to draw conclusions about the @xmath2 region , either through analytical continuation  @xcite or by the canonical approach  @xcite .",
    "these studies were so far restricted to a small range of @xmath2 . to overcome such limitations ,",
    "the imaginary chemical potential matching approach has been proposed in ref .",
    "the basic aim of this approach is the modeling of the qcd phase diagram starting from a suitable effective lagrangian constrained by direct comparison with lqcd results in the region of imaginary chemical potentials @xmath0 .",
    "the implementation of the correct qcd behavior in the @xmath0 region is then a necessary ( though not sufficient ) requirement for proceeding to physical ( real ) chemical potentials .",
    "the analytic continuation of lqcd data from @xmath0 to @xmath2 commonly assumes a certain form ( e. g. polynomial ) for the interpolating function .",
    "this implies a limiting convergence radius .",
    "( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed assessment ) .",
    "the strategy pursued in the present work is different . given an effective lagrangian starting from qcd and its symmetries , a set of possible types of effective interactions between quarks is introduced .",
    "to the extent that these interactions are not entirely determined just by the physical low - mass meson spectrum , lattice qcd results at finite @xmath0 are useful in providing additional constraints .",
    "once the relevant effective interactions are fixed , the continuation to finite @xmath2 is not subject to convergence radius limitations any more .",
    "the pnjl model is of considerable interest in this context . in previous work",
    "@xcite it was shown that the pnjl model can reproduce the rw periodicity together with other important qcd properties such as spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the rw periodicity is described by the extended @xmath21 symmetry defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is any integer ; @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the polyakov loop and its conjugate , respectively . in the pnjl model",
    "this symmetry is realized by construction .",
    "it has in fact been shown that the _ local _ version of the pnjl model is capable of reproducing the lqcd data at finite @xmath0 , but at the expense of introducing scalar - type eight - quark and vector - type four - quark interactions  @xcite , or a polyakov - loop dependent njl coupling strength  @xcite , in addition to the standard ( scalar plus pseudoscalar ) chiral contact interactions between quarks .",
    "the local pnjl model still works with a schematic ad - hoc momentum - space cutoff that has no foundation in qcd .",
    "more direct contacts with qcd have recently been established by introducing the _ nonlocal _ pnjl model  @xcite and by pointing out its formal derivation from qcd  @xcite .",
    "nonlocal interactions were also investigated , for example , within the framework of njl  @xcite and instanton models  @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to extend the nonlocal pnjl approach to imaginary chemical potentials in order to examine its properties in direct comparison with lqcd results .",
    "very recently , independent related calculations have been performed @xcite in parallel to the present investigations , leading to qualitatively similar conclusions .",
    "the additional new element in the present work is the detailed study of the role of ( nonderivative ) vector interactions between quarks as they emerge from their basic color - current couplings .    in the present work we restrict ourselves to the two - flavor case .",
    "section  ii briefly summarizes the nonlocal @xmath1 pnjl model in its latest version  @xcite with the inclusion of quark wave - function - renormalization effects .",
    "numerical results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "the paper closes with a summary and conclusions in sec .",
    "this section proceeds in several steps , starting with a brief exhibition of the nonlocal pnjl model and its thermodynamics , followed by some symmetry considerations .",
    "finally , a possible additional vector - current interaction between quarks will be incorporated .",
    "such a lorentz - vector interaction is usually not part of the standard pnjl model .",
    "it is expected to play a pronounced role , however , in studies extended to imaginary chemical potentials .",
