    "the structure of relativistic stars and the phenomenon of gravitational collapse is of fundamental importance in astrophysics and has attracted much attention in the relativist community since the formulation of general relativity .",
    "relatively to the construction of theoretical models of relativistic stars , one may refer to the pioneering work of schwarzschild @xcite , tolman @xcite , and oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite .",
    "schwarzschild @xcite considered analytic solutions describing a star of uniform density , and tolman @xcite developed a method providing explicit solutions for static spheres of fluid , which proved important to the study of stellar structure .",
    "oppenheimer and volkoff @xcite by suitably choosing specific tolman solutions studied the gravitational equilibrium of neutron stars , using the equation of state for a cold fermi gas , consequently laying down the foundations of the general relativistic theory of stellar structures .",
    "paging through history one finds an extremely extensive literature  @xcite , however , one may refer to the important contributions of chandrasekhar @xcite in the construction of white - dwarf models by taking into account special relativistic effects in the electron degeneracy equation of state , where he discovered that no white dwarf may have a mass greater than @xmath1 solar masses , which has been called the chandrasekhar limit ; and the work of baade and zwicky @xcite , where they invented the concept of a neutron star , and identified astronomical objects denoted as supernovae , representing a transitional collapse of an ordinary star into a neutron star .",
    "far from undertaking an exhaustive review , one may also refer to the work of wyman , where in ref .",
    "@xcite isotropic coordinates were used to solve the relativistic equations of a perfect fluid with constant energy density , and in ref .",
    "@xcite , a critical examination and generalization of the tolman solutions was undertaken ; buchdahl @xcite and bondi @xcite generalized the interior schwarzschild solution to more general static fluid spheres in the form of inequalities involving the mass concentration , central energy density and central pressure ; leibovitz @xcite also generalized some of tolman s solutions by applying a more physical approach ; and the discovery of pulsars by hewish _",
    "et al _ @xcite , the idea advanced by gold @xcite that pulsars might be rotating neutron stars , which was later confirmed by observations , and the idealized models of rotating neutron stars @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that bayin found new solutions for static fluid spheres @xcite , explored the time - dependent field equations for radiating fluid spheres @xcite , and further generalized the analysis to anisotropic fluid spheres @xcite .",
    "relatively to the issue of gravitational collapse , before the mid-1960s , the object now known as a black hole , was referred to as a collapsed star @xcite .",
    "oppenheimer and snyder @xcite , in 1939 , provided the first insights of the gravitational collapse into a black hole , however , it was only in 1965 that marked an era of intensive research into black hole physics .",
    "although evidence for the existence of black holes is very convincing , it has recently been argued that the observational data can provide very strong arguments in favor of the existence of event horizons but can not fundamentally prove it @xcite .",
    "this scepticism has inspired new and fascinating ideas . in this line of thought , it is interesting to note that a new final state of gravitational collapse has been proposed by mazur and mottola @xcite . in this model , and in the related picture developed by laughlin _ et al _ @xcite , the quantum vacuum undergoes a phase transition at or near the location where the event horizon is expected to form .",
    "the model denoted as a gravastar ( _ grav_itational _ va_cuum _ star _ ) , consists of a compact object with an interior de sitter condensate , governed by an equation of state given by @xmath2 , matched to a shell of finite thickness with an equation of state @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is then matched to an exterior schwarzschild vacuum solution .",
    "the thick shell replaces both the de sitter and the schwarzschild horizons , therefore , this gravastar model has no singularity at the origin and no event horizon , as its rigid surface is located at a radius slightly greater than the schwarzschild radius .",
    "it has been argued that there is no way of distinguishing a schwarzschild black hole from a gravastar from observational data @xcite .",
    "it was also further shown by mazur and mottola that gravastars are thermodynamically stable .",
    "related models , analyzed in a different context have also been considered by dymnikova @xcite . however , in a simplified model of the mazur - mottola picture , visser and wiltshire @xcite constructed a model by matching an interior solution with @xmath2 to an exterior schwarzschild solution at a junction interface , comprising of a thin shell .",
    "the dynamic stability was then analyzed , and it was found that some physically reasonable stable equations of state for the transition layer exist . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a generalized class of similar gravastar models that exhibit a continuous pressure profile , without the presence of thin shells was analyzed .",
    "it was found that the presence of anisotropic pressures are unavoidable , and the tov equation was used to place constraints on the anisotropic parameter .",
    "it was also found that the transverse pressures permit a higher compactness than is given by the buchdahl - bondi bound @xcite for perfect fluid stars , and several features of the anisotropic equation of state were explored . in ref .",
    "@xcite , motivated by low energy string theory , an alternative model was constructed by replacing the de sitter regime with an interior solution governed by a chaplygin gas equation of state , interpreted as a born - infeld phantom gravastar .",
    "it has also been recently proposed by chapline that this new emerging picture consisting of a compact object resembling ordinary spacetime , in which the vacuum energy is much larger than the cosmological vacuum energy , has been denoted as a `` dark energy star '' @xcite .",
    "in fact , in the present paper a mathematical model generalizing the mazur - mottola picture , or for that matter , the visser - wiltshire model is proposed , where the interior de sitter solution is replaced by a solution governed by the dark energy equation of state , @xmath4 with @xmath5 , matched to an exterior vacuum schwarzschild solution .",
    "note that the particular case of @xmath6 reduces to the visser - wiltshire gravastar model .",
    "the motivation for implementing this generalization comes from the fact that recent observations have confirmed that the universe is undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion .",
    "evidence of this cosmological expansion has been shown independently from measurements of supernovae of type ia ( sne ia ) @xcite and from cosmic microwave background radiation @xcite .",
    "a possible candidate proposed for this cosmic acceleration is precisely that of dark energy , a cosmic fluid parametrized by an equation of state @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the spatially homogeneous pressure and @xmath9 the dark energy density . if @xmath10 , a case certainly not excluded , and in fact favored , by observations , the null energy condition is violated . for this case ,",
    "the cosmic fluid is denoted phantom energy , and possesses peculiar properties , such as negative temperatures @xcite and the energy density increases to infinity in a finite time , resulting in a big rip @xcite .",
    "it also provides one with a natural scenario for the existence of exotic geometries such as wormholes @xcite . in this context",
    ", it was also shown that the masses of all black holes tend to zero as the phantom energy universe approaches the big rip  @xcite .",
    "however , it is interesting that recent fits to supernovae , cmb and weak gravitational lensing data favor an equation of state with a dark energy parameter crossing the phantom divide @xmath6 @xcite . in a cosmological setting the transition into the phantom regime , for a single scalar field @xcite is probably physically implausible , thus the stress energy tensor should include a mixture of various interacting non - ideal fluids .    as emphasized in refs .",
    "@xcite , in a rather different context , a subtlety needs to be pointed out : the notion of dark energy is that of a spatially homogeneous cosmic fluid , however , it can be extended to inhomogeneous spherically symmetric spacetimes by regarding that the pressure in the dark energy equation of state is a negative radial pressure , and the transverse pressure may be determined via the field equations .",
    "( an inhomogeneous spherically symmetric dark energy scalar field was also considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "the generalization of the gravastar picture with the inclusion of an interior solution governed by the equation of state , @xmath11 with @xmath5 , will be denoted by a dark energy gravastar , or simply a `` dark energy star '' in agreement with the chapline definition @xcite .",
    "we shall explore several configurations , by imposing specific choices for the mass function .",
    "we shall then explore the dynamical stability of the transition layer of these models to linearized perturbations around static solutions , by applying the general stability formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and which was also applied in the context of the stability of phantom wormholes @xcite , and further analyze the evolution identity to extract some physical insight regarding the pressure balance equation across the junction interface .",
    "the dark energy star outlined in this paper may possibly have an origin in a density fluctuation in the cosmological background .",
    "it is uncertain how such inhomogeneities in the dark energy may be formed .",
    "however , a possible explanation may be inferred from ref .",
    "@xcite , where the dark energy equation of state was generalized to include an inhomogeneous hubble parameter dependent term , possibly resulting in the nucleation of a dark energy star through a density perturbation .",
    "this paper is outlined in the following manner . in section",
    "ii , we present the structure equations of dark energy stellar models . in section iii ,",
    "specific models are then analyzed by imposing particular choices for the mass function . in section iv",
    ", the linearized stability analysis procedure is briefly outlined , and the stability regions of the transition layer of specific dark energy stars are determined . finally in section",

    "the above analysis shows that stable configurations of the surface layer , located sufficiently near to where the event horizon is expected to form , do indeed exist .",

    "now , as @xmath59 is considered to be non - negative , by construction , then an additional restriction needs to be imposed , namely , @xmath159 .",
    "however , as we are primarily interested in the behavior of the model s surface layer where the event horizon is expected to form , i.e. , @xmath160 , we shall only analyze the domain @xmath161 .    for the case of @xmath148 , as in the previous example",
    ", one may also prove that @xmath151 , so that the stability regions are also dictated by inequality ( [ stability2 ] ) .",
    "the stability regions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : tmw ] , for the specific case of @xmath154 .",
    "it is possible to show that the stability regions , for this specific case , are very insensitive to variations in @xmath66 .",
    "one may prove that the stability configurations slightly increase for high @xmath162 , and slightly decrease for relatively low values of @xmath162 , for decreasing values of the dark energy parameter @xmath66 .",
    "the message that one may extract , as in the previous example , is that stable dark energy stars exist with a transition layer placed sufficiently close to where the event horizon is expected to form , so that the exterior geometry of these stars would be difficult to distinguish from an astrophysical black hole .    .",
    "the stability region is given below the surface .",
    "see the text for details.,width=268 ]",
    "although evidence for the existence of black holes is very convincing , a certain amount of scepticism regarding the physical reality of event horizons is still encountered , and it has been argued that despite the fact that observational data do indeed provide strong arguments in favor of event horizons , they can not fundamentally prove their existence @xcite . in part , due to this scepticism , a new picture for an alternative final state of gravitational collapse has emerged , where an interior compact object is matched to an exterior schwarzschild vacuum spacetime , at or near where the event horizon is expected to form .",
    "therefore , these alternative models do not possess a singularity at the origin and have no event horizon , as its rigid surface is located at a radius slightly greater than the schwarzschild radius . in particular , the gravastar picture , proposed by mazur and mottola @xcite , has an effective phase transition at / near where the event horizon is expected to form , and the interior is replaced by a de sitter condensate .",
    "the latter is then matched to a thick layer , with an equation of state given by @xmath3 , which is in turn matched to an exterior schwarzschild solution .",
    "a simplified model was then proposed by visser and wiltshire @xcite , where the matching occurred at a thin shell .",
    "it has also been argued that there is no way of distinguishing a schwarzschild black hole from a gravastar from observational data @xcite . in this work ,",
    "a generalization of the gravastar picture was explored , by considering a matching of an interior solution governed by the dark energy equation of state , @xmath163 , to an exterior schwarzschild vacuum solution at a junction interface .",
    "we emphasize that the motivation for implementing this generalization arises from the fact that recent observations have confirmed an accelerated expansion of the universe , for which dark energy , a cosmic fluid dictated by an equation of state given by @xmath164 with @xmath5 , is a possible candidate .",
    "we have analyzed several relativistic dark energy stellar configurations by imposing specific choices for the mass function .",
    "the first case considered was that of a constant energy density , and the second choice , that of a monotonic decreasing energy density in the star s interior .",
    "we then further explored the dynamical stability of the transition layer of these dark energy stars to linearized spherically symmetric radial perturbations about static equilibrium solutions .",
    "it was found that large stability regions do exist , which are located sufficiently close to where the event horizon is expected to form , so that it would be difficult to distinguish the exterior geometry of the dark energy stars , analyzed in this work , from an astrophysical black hole .",
    "the possibility of the existence of dark energy , responsible for the present accelerated expansion of the universe , has opened up new possibilities in theoretical research . in this context , by extending the notion of a spatially homogeneous dark energy fluid , to inhomogeneous spherically symmetric spacetimes , such as dark energy stars , we point out that the latter have some interesting physical properties .",
    "note that recent fits to supernovae , cmb and weak gravitational lensing data favor an evolving equation of state , with dark energy parameter crossing the phantom divide @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thus , in a rather speculative scenario , one may consider the existence of a dark energy star , with an evolving parameter starting out in the range @xmath49 , and crossing the phantom divide , @xmath6 . a possible approach would be to consider a mixture of interacting non - ideal fluids , as it seems that in a cosmological setting the transition into the phantom regime is physically implausible , for a single scalar field @xcite .",
    "one could also apply variations of the approach outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite , where an inhomogeneous spherically symmetric dark energy scalar field was considered , although the latter model does not allow a phantom crossing . once in the phantom regime ,",
    "the null energy condition is violated , which physically implies that the negative radial pressure exceeds the energy density .",
    "therefore , an enormous pressure in the center may , in principle , imply a topology change , consequently opening up a tunnel , and converting the dark energy star into a wormhole @xcite .",
    "( however , it is still uncertain whether topology changes will be permitted by an eventual theory of quantum gravity ) .",
    "it has recently been shown that traversable wormholes may , in principle , be supported by phantom energy @xcite , which apart from being used as interstellar shortcuts , may induce closed timelike curves with the associated causality violations @xcite .",
    "it should be interesting to construct a mathematical model illustrating this conversion , i.e. , dark energy star into a wormhole , by considering a time - dependent dark energy parameter , which we leave for a future work .",
    "perhaps not so appealing , one could denote these exotic geometries consisting of dark energy stars ( in the phantom regime ) and phantom wormholes as _ phantom stars_. as emphasized in the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite , we would also like to state our agnostic position relatively to the existence of dark energy stars , however , it is important to understand their general properties to further understand the observational data of astrophysical black holes .",
