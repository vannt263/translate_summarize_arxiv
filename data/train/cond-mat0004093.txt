    "if the number of electrons artificially confined on a quasi two - dimensional electron island ( made for example in a semiconductor heterostructure ) is very large , many properties of such a so - called `` quantum dot '' or `` artificial atom ''  @xcite can be described from what is known about the limit of the infinite ( two - dimensional ) electron gas ( 2deg ) . until now",
    ", most experiments  @xcite were performed at electron densities which are slightly below the equilibrium density of the 2deg .",
    "the liquid - like properties then still dominate . for only a few trapped particles (",
    "as experimentally realized in vertical quantum dots  @xcite ) , pronounced addition energy maxima as a consequence of shell structure and aligned spins in the mid - shell regions due to hund s rules were observed in close analogy to atomic physics  @xcite .",
    "even the simplest picture of @xmath1 non - interacting particles in a two - dimensional harmonic trap could explain many features of the conductance spectra . for larger systems ,",
    "mean field approaches like hartree - fock  @xcite or density functional methods  @xcite were applied . in the small-@xmath1 limit , much theoretical work focused on exact diagonalization techniques  @xcite .",
    "this approach was mostly used for dots in magnetic fields , where correlations become increasingly important with field strengths .",
    "it was particularly successful in the ( integer and fractional ) quantum hall regime where one can restrict the basis set to the lowest spin - polarized landau level  @xcite .",
    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc )  @xcite methods provide alternative approaches yielding energies whose accuracy reaches that of exact diagonalizations .",
    "when the electron density is lowered and the coulomb energy increases relative to the kinetic energy , correlations begin to strongly dominate the electronic structure also in the absence of magnetic fields . for densities smaller than a certain critical value a wigner crystal  @xcite will be formed , in which the coulomb interaction distributes the single electrons classically on a lattice . for the homogeneous two - dimensional electron gas , such crystallization",
    "is expected at very low densities .",
    "monte - carlo calculations indicate that in the 2d bulk a transition to a wigner crystal - like state , preceeded by a transition to a polarized phase  @xcite , occurs only at densities corresponding to wigner - seitz radii @xmath2  @xcite ( the density @xmath3 and @xmath4 are related by @xmath5 ) , whereas in 3d the classical limit lies as high as @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "( in the following , for simplicity we write @xmath7 . )",
    "chui and tanatar  @xcite found that in 2d systems without translational invariance the critical density parameter for a fluid - solid transition is shifted to a considerably smaller value ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "could this be important for _ finite _ systems such as the above mentioned lateral or vertical semiconductor quantum dot structures ?",
    "this question was recently posed  @xcite and it was argued that in finite systems confining only a few particles localization would indeed occur at significantly higher densities than in the 2d bulk . in the wigner limit the few electrons in the trap would distribute such that their electrostatic repulsion is minimized . the internal structure of the wave function of the many body system should then have the symmetry of the corresponding classical charge distribution .",
    "wigner crystallization was found to be particularly pronounced in quantum dots with steep walls and polygonal geometry  @xcite .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have performed quantum monte carlo studies using a multilevel blocking algorithm  @xcite . for parabolic quantum dots with azimuthal symmetry",
    "they reported that at a critical density of @xmath9 the formation of wigner molecule - like ground states should become energetically favorable .",
    "hartree - fock ( hf ) methods by definition fail to accurately describe the correlated regime .",
    "when performed in an unrestricted scheme , however , spontaneous symmetry breaking and localization in the spatial distribution of the electronic densities of quantum dots and lateral quantum dot molecules at @xmath10 was attributed to the onset of wigner crystallization  @xcite .    in the present article",
    "we report numerically exact configuration interaction calculations .",
    "this method has a long history in quantum chemistry , and was applied to quantum dots by many different groups  @xcite .",
    "much of the previous work , however , concentrated on the electronic structure in large magnetic fields where the electron gas is polarized .",
    "our purpose here is a comparison of the exact diagonalization results to the above mentioned recent predictions of localized states in the low - density limit and zero magnetic field .",
    "we first give a brief outline of the configuration interaction method and then turn to a discussion of the many - body spectra of a six - electron quantum dot at zero angular momentum as a function of the average electron density in the dot .",
    "calculations for different @xmath11-values indicate that the ground state remains unpolarized . at values of @xmath11 which are accessible to exact diagonalization techniques , for",
    "a dot confining six electrons clear signals of formation of a wigner molecule could not be observed .",
    "we conclude with a brief comparison to results of density functional theory ( dft ) in the local density approximation ( lsda ) describing the electronic ground state structures .",

    "in general , the electron - electron interaction tends to expand the system , and thus @xmath32 . this effect becomes stronger with increasing @xmath11 and we used the ( empirical ) relation @xmath33  .",
    "the two - body matrix elements of the electron - electron interaction are calculated using the addition theorem for @xmath34  @xcite . to set up the fock states for diagonalization",
    ", we use eight lowest oscillator shells containing 36 states and sample over the full space with a fixed number of spin down and spin up electrons , @xmath35 . from this sampling , only those fock states with a given total orbital angular momentum and a configuration energy ( corresponding to the sum of occupied single - particle energies ) less than or equal to a specified cutoff energy @xmath36 are included ( see figure  [ f1 ] below for an example ) .",
    "the purpose was to select only the most important fock states from the full basis , hereby reducing the matrix dimension to a size @xmath37 . to obtain all the eigenstates we have to set @xmath38 for even particle numbers ( @xmath39 , all states with different total spin have this component ) , and",
    "analogously we would have @xmath40 for odd numbers .",
    "once the active fock states are at disposal , the hamiltonian matrix is calculated .",
    "for lanczos diagonalization we use the arpack library  @xcite . finally , the total spin of each eigenvector is determined by calculating the expectation value of the @xmath41 operator .    as mentioned above , setting up the hamiltonian matrix from chosen fock states and subsequent diagonalization only in principle",
    "yields an exact solution of the many - body problem . for reasons of numerical feasibility",
    "it is necessary to truncate the set of basis functions to be used in the diagonalization .",
    "one then has to make sure that convergence of the spectra is reached with respect to the cut - off . as the required matrix size increases rapidly with @xmath1 , computational expenses severely restrict the calculations to only the smallest systems at not too large values of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , with increasing electron number or @xmath11 , the results become less accurate due to the restricted number of basis states that can be included in the calculations .",
    "( the fact that the ground and excited states are the closer in energy the larger the particle number @xmath1 imposes an additional difficulty . )    for a quantum dot confining @xmath42 electrons at a density corresponding to @xmath43 ( the largest value of @xmath11 we found accessible within the calculational scheme used here ) , figure  [ f1 ] shows the convergence of the many - body spectra as a function of the cut - off energy @xmath44 .",
    "the lowest possible fock state for six electrons has two particles in the state @xmath45 and four particles in @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the configuration energy equals @xmath47 .",
    "this means that for the spectra with different cut - off energies displayed in figure  [ f1 ] all excitations up to an energy @xmath48 are included .",
    "the many - body spectra for @xmath49 and @xmath50 differ drastically from the results obtained for @xmath51 .",
    "looking at the relative ordering of the levels and the spin sequence , it becomes clear that convergence is only reached for @xmath52 .",
    "the ground - state energy for zero angular momentum is @xmath53  ha@xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56  ha@xmath54 for @xmath57 .",
    "an extrapolation to infinite cut - off energy can be made by plotting the total energy as a function of @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "this gives the estimate 3.043  ha@xmath54 for the fully converged results at @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath59 a too small number of slater determinants was included to build up the required correlations , such that the polarized @xmath60 state appeared as the ground state .",
    "( we identify a similar effect in unrestricted hf results mentioned above  @xcite , where the single slater determinant that is available incorrectly favors a spin - polarized ground state  @xcite . ) while for @xmath61 the matrix dimension @xmath62 with 21448811 non - zero matrix elements is reasonably small , the value @xmath63 already yields a matrix dimension 108375 with 67521121 non - zero matrix elements . as for larger densities the states",
    "are less correlated , a smaller number of slater determinants is needed for an accurate description .",
    "density parameters larger than @xmath64 or a higher number of particles than @xmath42 would go beyond the limits of numerical feasibility and accurate results could not be obtained .",

    "@xcite who found for the ground state a density profile with a clear shoulder as in the polarized case . )",
    "the azimuthal averages of the density profiles qualitatively have similarities with the broken symmetry solutions of the unrestricted hf  @xcite which for the paramagnetic case results in a ring of six electrons , and for the ferromagnetic case ( ground state in hf ) a ring of five electrons with one electron in the center . however , the localization of the electrons is largely exaggerated in hf .",
    "opposite to hf , the lsda correctly gives the paramagnetic state as the ground state , and its density profile resembles the exact result .",
    "lsda does not break the azimuthal symmetry until @xmath81 when spin- or charge density wave - like states can occur  @xcite .",
    "purely classical  monte carlo  @xcite computations have shown that for @xmath82 the charges are distributed on the perimeter of the dot , and none of the particles occupies the dot center .",
    "this changes for @xmath42 , where the charge distribution with lowest energy consists of five electrons sitting on a ring , with the remaining electron occupying the center of the dot .",
    "this configuration is labeled by @xmath83 .",
    "if all 6 particles are arranged on the dot perimeter ( labeled by @xmath84 ) , the classical state is stable but has a higher energy than the @xmath83-configuration .",
    "= 6.5 cm    the classical charge distribution can be arbitrarily oriented . the density from the ci solution , however , must be circularly symmetric . for an azimuthal average of the @xmath83-pentagon structure , one would expect a pronounced maximum of the electron density in the center , and a less pronounced maximum at the dot radius .",
    "correspondingly , the @xmath84 configuration should correspond to a minimum of charge density in the center and a maximum at finite radius .",
    "a first comparison of exact diagonalization calculations with the results of the mean - field approximation was given by pfannkuche _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for `` quantum dot helium '' , i.e. , quantum dots containing only two electrons .",
    "they found from a comparison of exact diagonalizations with hartree- and hartree - fock results that the exchange and correlation contributions are crucial . while the triplet state showed a reasonable agreement between the exact result and hf",
    ", the singlet could not be well reproduced . as mentioned above",
    ", yannouleas and landman  @xcite reported that in geometrically unrestricted hf at a density corresponding to @xmath10 the @xmath42 ground state is polarized and shows enhanced localization in the charge density .",
    "this @xmath60 state exhibits the same geometry than the classical distribution of 6 electrons in a harmonic well : 5 particles are equidistanly localized on the perimeter of the dot , and the 6th particle is trapped in the center of the harmonic well .",
    "the non - polarized @xmath71 state corresponding to the @xmath84-configuration is about 0.034  ha@xmath54 higher in energy .",
    "the exact diagonalization results described above do not support these hf results .",
    "although being limited to small @xmath11 values due to the necessary restrictions of the basis set , the systematic evolution and energy sequence of ci energies and densities shown in figs .",
    "[ f2 ] and [ f4 ] seems to indicate that polarization as well as formation of wigner molecules in circularly symmetric , parabolic wells would be impossible at densities as large as predicted by hf  @xcite .",
    "the geometrically unrestricted solution of the kohn - sham equations of  @xcite tend to overestimate the @xmath11-value at which spontaneously broken spin- or charge - symmetries can occur in the internal structure of the wave function  @xcite .",
    "although calculated in a geometrically unrestricted dft scheme , the fully converged lsda densities for @xmath85 shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] are azimuthally symmetric .",
    "although lsda suffers from the self - interaction problem , at the densities in question the results are in better agreement with ci studies than the unrestricted hf results .",
    "it is finally of interest to study how the spin and spatial symmetry in the internal structure of the wave function can be recognized in the pair correlation function @xmath86 which describes the probablity to find another ( spin up or down ) particle if a particle with spin up is placed at @xmath87 . here",
    "@xmath88 is the radius of maximum density and @xmath89 the angle between the electrons .",

    "one clearly concludes that the @xmath71 state has 6-fold symmetry with antiferromagetic spin ordering , whereas the fully polarized case shows four maxima , corresponding to a five - fold symmetry .",
    "these intrinsic symmetries are in qualitative agreement with the unrestricted hf results , although the crystallization predicted by hf does not yet occur .",
    "we commented on the recent conjecture that wigner molecules would form in quantum dots at rather large electron densities @xmath93  @xcite .",
    "our results are essentially exact up to @xmath94 for six confined particles .",
    "the many - body spectra , densities and pair correlations obtained for @xmath42 clearly illustrate that the onset of formation of wigner molecules and in particular , polarization of the ground state should be expected at much higher @xmath11-values than anticipated from unrestricted hf  @xcite",
    ". the critical density at which such a transition occurs does , in fact , strongly depend also on geometry  @xcite and on the number of confined particles at fixed average electron density in the dot .",
    "for the six - electron dot at @xmath95 in question  @xcite , the `` exact '' ground - state clearly prefers @xmath71 and shows antiferromagnetic order in the pair correlation . the polarized state with @xmath96-symmetry is clearly higher in energy even than the @xmath73 state , which would also be a candidate for the classical @xmath83 ground state configuration  @xcite .",
    "in addition , for values below @xmath43 we did not find clear signals of rotational structure in the spectra for non - zero angular momenta that would indicate a crystallized ground state .",
    "we note that the situation is different for @xmath97 , where for densities as large as @xmath98 the low - lying states could be well understood by assuming a square - shaped @xmath99 wigner molecule for the internal structure of the wave function and analyzing its rotational structure .",
    "this also became clear when comparing the low - energy spectrum of a heisenberg model with four electrons on a square  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath100 , however , this simple picture does seem to not hold , as our results for @xmath42 clearly point out .",
    "the ground - state energies and densities obtained by density functional calculations in the local spin density approximation agree rather well with the results of exact diagonalizations , even though this comparison was restricted to a small particle number where the accuracy of the local density approximation is questionable .",
    "this gives some confidence that the method is well suited for describing the ground state electronic structures for larger sizes .",
