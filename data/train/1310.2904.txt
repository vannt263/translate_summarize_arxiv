    "strong coupling between structural defects and magnetic , superconducting and charge ordering properties has been found in a wide range of important materials .",
    "the precise size and arrangements of atoms in a nano - cluster can control the magnetic ground state of a nanomagnet , tuning the strength of its magnetic interactions and inducing frustration.@xcite such coupling is also of great significance in the cuprate and iron pnictide high temperature superconductors.@xcite the superconductivity of these compounds is strongly tied to the existence of antiferromagnetic spin - striped phases , whose formation and positions are tuned by cation and anion doping.@xcite the well known verwey charge - ordering transition in magnetite is also related to the formation of a complex trimeron structure , with these polarons fluctuating above the transition.@xcite despite these phenomena generating great interest , detailed crystallographic studies of coupling between the defect structure and the electronic properties they control remains difficult and have rarely been achieved .",
    "wstite , fe@xmath0o , is a canonical example of such coupling , with strong interactions between its structural defects and nanoscale magnetic inhomogenities , despite its deceptively simple cubic rock - salt average structure.@xcite wstite has a significant effect on the chemistry of the earth s lower mantle and is almost always iron deficient , leading to a fraction of the iron oxidising to the trivalent state.@xcite these cations have been shown to occupy tetrahedral interstitial sites ( t ) and have a significant effect on the physical properties of wstite , including how it transmits seismic waves.@xcite they have also been shown to influence its magnetic structure.@xcite    the arrangements of the interstitial iron cations is complex and has been debated for over fifty years.@xcite they have been shown to be surrounded by four octahedral vacancies ( v ) but how individual v@xmath2 t units connect to each other , as well as their size and distribution , remains unclear .",
    "the two most commonly accepted models of these defect clusters have v@xmath2 t units connected in an edge - sharing or corner - sharing , koch - cohen - like , fashion.@xcite these differ in nearest - neighbour interstitial iron atoms being related to each other along @xmath3 or @xmath1 vectors ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "alternatively the v@xmath2 t units could be connected by their corners along @xmath4 axes , forming spinel - like clusters similar to the structure of magnetite , fe@xmath5o@xmath2,@xcite one of the products of wstite disproportionation.@xcite     wstite v@xmath2 t defect units in a ) a @xmath3 edge - sharing cluster , b ) a @xmath1 koch - cohen cluster and c ) a @xmath4 spinel - like cluster .",
    "the octahedral iron , tetrahedral iron and octahedral vacancies are dark blue , tangerine and white , respectively , width=313 ]    although the defects significantly effect the magnetic properties of wstite the magnetic structure of the defect clusters remains unclear.@xcite fe@xmath0o orders antiferromagnetically at about 200k into a rhombohedral @xmath6 phase in which the bulk fe@xmath7 moments are said to be ordered ferromagnetically within ( 111 ) planes of the parent cubic lattice.@xcite the spins are thought to lie parallel to the [ 111 ] direction and neighbouring planes are coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "the magnetic moment of the average structure is unusually low , about two - thirds of the expected value , and the tetrahedral iron centres do not exhibit long range magnetic order.@xcite these observations have been attributed to the iron spins in a tetrahedral cluster lying along a randomly chosen direction in the ( 111 ) planes , along with the octahedral irons closest to them due to spin coupling between these octahedral and the tetrahedral cations.@xcite however reasonable this model might be there is little direct evidence to support it .    understanding the details of the local structure of wstite would offer greater insight into the coupling of its nano - sized defect clusters to bulk magnetic ordering in a way that may prove useful in studying a variety of conceptually - related functional materials .",
    "reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) refinements of neutron diffraction total scattering data have recently been shown to be capable of probing the local atomic and magnetic structure of complex materials.@xcite in this work we utilised this approach to elucidate the details of the defect and magnetic architecture of wstite .",
    "after a brief description of the experimental conditions and the analytical approach employed we discuss the monte carlo simulations used to set up the initial models for the rmc refinements .",
    "this is followed by analysis of the nuclear structure of wstite , which allows insight into the particular direction along which v@xmath2 t units connect in order to make larger clusters .",
    "finally the magnetic structure of wstite will be examined , discussing the magnetic structure of the bulk iron and that of the interstitial cations , as well as the interactions between these two components .",
    "we find that the magnetic structure of the bulk iron is more complex than previously thought and that our refinements are consistent with the formation of corner - sharing , koch - cohen - like , defect clusters , which in turn support weak ferromagnetic coupling .",
    "an 8 g sample of wstite was made by heating a finely ground mixture of fe and fe@xmath8o@xmath5 in a evacuated sealed quartz vessel at 1173k overnight , after which it was quenched in liquid nitrogen.@xcite the stoichiometry was subsequently determined thermogravometrically to be fe@xmath9o .",
    "high quality neutron diffraction data suitable for total scattering analysis were collected on the gem diffractometer at isis,@xcite at temperatures of 10k and 300k , chosen to lie well above and below the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature .",
    "data were collected over the range 0.3 @xmath10 q @xmath10 50@xmath11 .",
    "the data were initially fitted by rietveld refinements in the program gsas@xcite using cubic models , since the rhombohedral splitting of the magnetically ordered phase was too small to be observed .",
    "lattice parameters of 4.28989(11)  and 4.2867(4)  were obtained from the 300k and 10k data , respectively .",
    "the displacement parameters of the octahedral and tetrahedral cations were constrained to be equal and their occupancies refined , in a manner that ensured they were consistent with the sample stoichiometry , to 0.844(2 ) and 0.029(1 ) against the 300k data , respectively . it should be noted that the tetrahedral site has twice the multiplicity of the octahedral site and that the refined values are within error of those obtained from refinements against the 10k patterns .    the total scattering data , _ f_(_q _ ) and _ d_(_r _ ) , were then normalised using the program gudrun@xcite and models refined using the rmcprofile@xcite suite of programs , using a similar methodology to that employed in an earlier study of mno.@xcite atomistic models based on @xmath12 supercells of the cubic unit cell were used with lattice parameters and cation occupancies fixed to the values obtained from the rietveld refinements .",
    "these models contained 13762 octahedral iron ( fe@xmath13 ) , 1016 tetrahedral iron ( fe@xmath14 ) and 16384 oxygen atoms ; further details are described in section iii.a . it should be noted that while all refined models are metrically cubic rmcprofile@xcite does not apply any symmetry elements so the models are allowed to have _ _ p__1 symmetry . for the 300k data the paramagnetic contribution to the reciprocal space _ f_(_q _ ) was modelled by assigning to each cation a spin with random orientation , thereby achieving a paramagnetic arrangement .",
    "the corresponding magnetic scattering function was subtracted from the _ f_(_q _ ) prior to fourier transform to the real space distribution function , expressed as _ d_(_r _ ) .",
    "refinements were carried out against the corrected _ d_(_r _ ) alongside the _ f_(_q _ ) and back - scattering bank bragg data.@xcite rmc refinements against the 300k data were performed , in which only atomic positions were allowed to change , by moving randomly - selected atoms by random fractions of a maximum move size in order to minimise the cost function @xmath15    where the @xmath16 corresponds to the various data sets being refined .",
    "the individual @xmath17 functions being minimised were , where @xmath18 is the neutron time - of - flight :    @xmath19 ^ 2\\sigma ^{-2}_{f(q)},\\ ] ]    @xmath20 ^ 2\\sigma ^{-2}_{d(r)},\\ ] ]    @xmath21 ^ 2\\sigma ^{-2}_\\mathrm{profile}\\ ] ]    the monte carlo algorithum avoids local minima by accepting individual moves that degrade the fit to the data with a probability that is inversely proportional to how much worse they make the fit .",
    "maximum move sizes of 0.0535 and 0.1000  were used for iron and oxygen atoms , respectively .",
    "the weighting , @xmath22 , of each dataset was selected such that the final @xmath23 values of each were similar and such that between 20 and 50% of attempted moves were accepted .",
    "it should be noted that the lowest region of the _ d_(_r _ ) data ( @xmath24 ) was weighted twice as heavily as the rest of this dataset : this range included the first three nearest neighbour interactions of all types of atom pairs , which was considered to be of most interest to this part of the study .",
    "the coherent magnetic scattering present within the 10k total scattering data prevents direct fourier transform of _ f_(_q _ ) to a meaningful nuclear _",
    "d_(_r _ ) function .",
    "it is , however , possible to calculate the magnetic component of the _ f_(_q _ ) directly from the atomic positions and their spin orientations in a model.@xcite this is then added to the nuclear _ f_(_q _ ) , obtained from a fourier transform of the radial distribution function to calculate the total _ f_(_q _ ) . consequently our 10k refinements were carried out using the _ f_(_q _ ) and bragg profile functions only .",
    "refinements allowed atomic positions and cation spin orientations to vary for alternating periods , using similar criteria for weighting data as described above .",
    "these refinements started from the equilibrated 300k models , including the random fe spin orientations used to model paramagnetic scattering in which the magnitude for all the octahedral and tetrahedral cations were set to 4 and 5@xmath25 , respectively.@xcite the bragg profile from the 24 - 45@xmath26 bank was used when refining the spin orientation , as this included all the reflections with significant magnetic contribution . in all refinements",
    "a closest approach of 1  was applied between all atoms and , based on the observed peak in the _ d_(_r _ ) , the minimum iron - oxygen nearest neighbour bond distance was restrained to 1.70  and 1.75  for 10 k and 300 k refinements , respectively .",
    "maximum fe  o distances of 2.1  and 2.45  for the fe@xmath14 and fe@xmath13 iron were used.@xcite",
    "the initial configurations used for the rmc refinements were generated by direct monte carlo simulations where the positions of the cations and vacancies on both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites were allowed to switch in - order to minimise the sum of an energy term @xmath27 ( where @xmath28 is the number of octahedral vacancies in the nearest - neighbour shell of a tetrahedral cation ) .",
    "this was done to ensure these models contained v@xmath2 t units .",
    "additionally half of the models generated included a term to penalise the formation of free octahedral vacancies that did not have a tetrahedral cation in their first coordination sphere to ensure the regions away from the interstitial clusters contained few vacancies .",
    "finally energy terms were also included in some models to encourage the v@xmath2 t units to connect into clusters along each of the three possible vectors ( @xmath3 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 ) , while penalising connectivity along the other two .",
    "these combinations led to eight different models and in each case rmc refinements were carried out using four distinct configurations to ensure statistical adequacy .",
    "the weightings of the various energy terms were modified for each configuration to ensure that at least 98%  of the tetrahedral interstitial cations were in complete v@xmath2 t units .",
    "where appropriate , a maximum of 2%  of octahedral vacancies were allowed to be free and the connectivity of the v@xmath2 t along the preferred ` growth ' directions were maximised .",
    "comparison of these initial models revealed several significant differences .",
    "firstly those models generated with a term to penalise the presence of free octahedral vacancies had two to three hundred defect clusters in them .",
    "this is three to ten times more than the number found in models without such a term , where the defects are typically larger .",
    "this difference was particularly stark for models generated with a preferred ` growth vector ' of @xmath1 and @xmath4 , where the absence of such a penalty results in models with several clusters containing more than one hundred interstitial cations .",
    "about 90%  of the defect clusters in those models with octahedral vacancies concentrated around them have less than ten interstitial cations and 98%  of clusters have less than forty tetrahedral cations , except from those with a preferred ` growth vector ' along the @xmath4 vectors have up to 4%  with more than forty tetrahedral cations .",
    "in contrast the models generated without an energy term concentrating the octahedral vacancies near the defect clusters have at least 20%  of their clusters with more than ten interstitial cations and this increases up to an average of 60(4)%  and 72(4)%  for models with v@xmath2 t units connected along the @xmath1 and @xmath4 vectors .",
    "the larger cluster size of these @xmath1 and @xmath4 models is emphasised by having an average of 29(14)%  and 27(2)%  of their clusters with more than 40 fe@xmath14 centres , although less than 10%   of the clusters in the other models are of this size .",
    "the smaller clusters in the models with octahedral vacancies concentrated near the interstitial cations also result in a more uniform distribution of clusters . in all cases , however , there are clearly regions with and without tetrahedral defects , reminiscent of the paracrystalline models previously suggested by welberry and christy.@xcite      rmc refinement of the various models against the 300k total scattering data resulted in good fits in all cases ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , although those with the vast majority of octahedral vacancies near the defect clusters gave a better fit ( see table  i ) .",
    "additionally it appears that the models with v@xmath2 t units that link into clusters along the @xmath1 directions give the best fit to data .",
    "this is true both overall and for each type of data fitted , although the difference is predictably subtle . despite this subtle difference",
    "this is our preferred solution and is supported by previous careful single crystal x - ray studies by koch and cohen@xcite and welberry and christy@xcite .",
    "it is an important finding given the precise nature of these defect clusters have been explored for the last fifty years via a variety of techniques without obtaining a definitive model of their structure.@xcite in general the crystallographic and magnetic structural details and bonding environments derived from all models are very similar and therefore only the results from those refinements where octahedral vacancies are concentrated near the interstitial clusters will be subsequently discussed .",
    ".statistical measures of fit , including standard deviations between models of the same type , to 300k neutron total scattering data . where applicable the preferred ` growth vector ' for v@xmath2 t units is given and model types i and ii are those generated without and with an energy term favouring octahedral vacancies concentrating near the defect clusters .",

    "the experimental fits are represented by the crosses , fits by red lines and difference plots are in blue.,width=313 ]    the refined fe@xmath13o bond distances are very close to the expected values from the average structure : for the bulk iron centres this averages 2.1476(3)2.1485(3)   ( the quoted error here and elsewhere for values obtained from the rmc refinements unless noted otherwise , is the standard error in the mean ) across the four different ` growth vector ' models ( see fig .  3a for a typical octahedral environment ) .",
    "these distances , however , get slightly shorter for fe@xmath13 centres closer to the tetrahedral defect clusters .",

    "this change is best reflected by an increase in the average bond valencies from 2.0285(13)2.0342(13 ) for the bulk iron to 2.104(4)2.174(6 ) for those fe@xmath13 atoms with more than two tetrahedral second nearest - neighbours.@xcite the bond angles of the fe@xmath7 centres closer to the defect clusters are also more distorted from an ideal octahedral environment .",

    "the bond distance is longer than the value of 1.85750(4)  refined from the average structure , which reduces the average bond valencies of the tetrahedral cation from 2.86 to 2.315(4)2.353(4).@xcite this is somewhat surprising since previous mssbauer studies have indicated that the fe@xmath14 cations are trivalent.@xcite consistent with previous studies , however , it appears that both the tetrahedral iron and the octahedral iron closer to the defect clusters have an average higher charge than the bulk.@xcite    that the tetrahedral cations may not be purely trivalent at high temperatures demands an increase of the negative charge on the defect cluster regions .",
    "this is caused by having more octahedral vacancies than tetrahedral interstitials in these regions , as required by an overall ratio of 2.7 vacancies per interstitial cation .",
    "this may be compensated for somewhat by the shortening of the mean fe@xmath14fe@xmath13 second and third nearest - neighbour distances . these average 3.4629(9)3.4783(9)  and 4.6074(8)4.6183(7)  across the four different types of ` growth vector ' models",

    "examining the oxygen bond valencies reveals that those oxygens that bond to either only fe@xmath13 or a mixture of fe@xmath13 and fe@xmath14 centre have reasonable average bond valencies , of 1.8493(10)1.8713(10 ) and 1.826(3)1.942(4 ) , respectively , across the four different ` growth vector ' models ( see fig .",

    "this increase in the apparent charge on the fe@xmath14 cations while the fe@xmath13 centres close to the defect clusters move slightly away from them may suggest a change in the charge distribution between 300k and 10k .",

    "overall our model is very reminiscent of a condensed spin - wave , such as that found in the related magnetic structure of mno.@xcite this view is emphasised when looking at the magnetic structure of a single ferromagnetically coupled ( 111 ) plane of wstite ( see fig .",
    "8b ) . here",
    "it can be seen that any atom is surrounded by six nearest neighbours , which can be broken down into three alternating groups of two atoms , each group having a spin orientation not adopted by the central atom ; the second - nearest neighbour fe@xmath13 have the same arrangement offset by 90@xmath26 .    the spin distribution and correlations of the octahedral cations closest to the tetrahedral clusters are similar to the bulk but have a broader distribution .",
    "this is in contrast with the work of battle and cheetham@xcite and wilkinson _ _ et al.__@xcite , who suggested the moments of the fe@xmath13 close to the defect clusters lie in or close to the ( 111 ) plane .",
    "given the previous models were primarily inferred from a lower than expected refined magnetic moment rather than a direct result of fits to experimental data , as is the case in this work , we believe it is more likely that the model in the current study is correct .",
    "it is possible , however , that the moments of the fe@xmath13 close to the defects do lie close to the ( 111 ) plane , as suggested by these previous studies , and our data is insensitive to this feature .",
    "fe@xmath13 atoms appear to couple in a weakly ferromagnetic fashion to their second nearest fe@xmath14 neighbours , with an average @xmath36fe@xmath37fe@xmath38@xmath39 spin correlation of 0.217(7 ) across the @xmath1 models at an average distance of 3.4928(6) .",
    "it should be noted that this term would be equal to 1 in a completely - ordered ferromagnet at 0k and @xmath40 in a pure antiferromagent .",
    "in contrast the coupling between the spins of fe@xmath13 cations and their third nearest fe@xmath14 neighbours are weakly antiferromagnetic , with an average spin correlation of @xmath410.213(6 ) at a distance of 4.6302(6) , although this decreases in magnitude as the octahedral iron get closer to the clusters .",
    "the direction between the octahedral cations and their second and third nearest neighbour fe@xmath14 atoms are similar , along the @xmath42 and @xmath43 vectors , so we suggest the differences in the coupling with these atoms is related to the distance between the cations .",
    "it is important to note that the distances at which these interactions occur are distinct from those at which fe@xmath13fe@xmath13 correlation take place so these results should be free of interference from such coupling .",
    "over half the octahedral cations have a tetrahedral atom in the third nearest neighbour shell and around a third of the octahedral cations have a tetrahedral cation in their second coordination sphere .",
    "therefore the spin orientation of most octahedral cations will be affected by coupling with tetrahedral neighbours and the resulting deviation of the magnetic structure from that of the defect free regions is the likely cause of the reduction of the average spin moment obtained from the rietveld refinements .",
    "examination of the refined spin distribution of the tetrahedral cations indicates that , overall , these have a random distribution and do not favour lying in the ( 111 ) plane , as previously hypothesised.@xcite unfortunately , the size of the clusters was too small to examine if there are any trends within individual defects .",
    "the strongest fe@xmath14fe@xmath14 coupling apparent in spin correlations plots are at the same distances as strong fe@xmath13fe@xmath13 correlations are observed ( see fig .",
    "we interpret this as being due to the fe@xmath13 atoms in wstite dominating its magnetic scattering due to their higher concentration .",
    "therefore , the signal from the fe@xmath14 is much weaker and where fe@xmath13fe@xmath13 correlations exist the fe@xmath14 spins refine in a way that is consistent with this coupling . excluding regions effected by such coupling the general trend of fe@xmath14fe@xmath14 correlations suggests the clusters have weak ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "the correlation length has been determined to be 1.31(9) , calculated a from fit to the average of the spin correlations functions for distances free from fe@xmath13fe@xmath13 contamination ( see fig .",

    "although there are some limitations in regards to the details obtained of the magnetic structure of the interstitial atoms , the greater insight into the magnetic structures of both the defect clusters and the bulk iron achieved in this study shows the clear advantages of the approach used in this work to analyse total scattering data .",
    "the first is the sensitivity of total scattering to both local nuclear and magnetic structures , which allows the interactions between these two aspects to be probed . that the rmc method probes total scattering data by refining large atomistic models in a stochastic fashion is also advantageous over other methods for analysing total scattering data , as seen from the refinement of the magnetic structure from a random arrangement of spins in the absence of a preconceived model.@xcite this approach allowed the non - collinear nature of the bulk fe@xmath13 magnetic structure to be established and then subsequently confirmed by an improved rietveld refinement of the average structure , when previous studies had overlooked this feature . while the weaker sensitivity of the data to the relatively low proportion of iron in the tetrahedral clusters ( about 7% ) , leads to the correlations of the bulk dominating somewhat where these overlap , this could at least partly be improved through other measurements , such as polarised neutron scattering . using data obtained at different temperatures was of great advantage in this respect as it allowed the nuclear structure to be examined free from the influence of magnetic order and",

    "our analysis suggests the structure of wstite is best described as islands of weakly ferromagnetically coupled fe@xmath14 clusters , most likely with intra - cluster connectivity along the @xmath1 axes .",
    "these are then surrounded by a bulk fe@xmath13 structure , the magnetic architecture of which is a non - collinear variant of type - ii antiferromagnetic order .",
    "it appears that most octahedral vacancies are found near to the defect clusters .",
    "there is also evidence of both charge and spin interactions between the defects and the bulk .",
    "there appears to be a change in charge distribution between ambient and low temperature , with the charge on the fe@xmath14 cations increasing at lower temperatures .",
    "the fe@xmath13 atoms nearest the clusters have broader spin distributions than the bulk , attributed to coupling to the fe@xmath14 cations . despite some limitations , particularly with regards to the magnetic structure of the interstitial iron cations , outlined above this work is , to the best of our knowledge , the first total scattering study to analyse the structure of wstite and hence to probe closely the relationship between its cluster defect structure and its magnetic architecture .",
