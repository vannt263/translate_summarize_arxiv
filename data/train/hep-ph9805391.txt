    "the suggestion that quantum coherence might be lost at the microscopic level was made by hawking@xcite , which suggested that asymptotic scattering should be described in term of a superscattering operator @xmath5 , relating initial and final density matrices , that does not factorize as a product of @xmath6 and @xmath7 matrix elements @xmath8 the loss of quantum coherence was thought to be a consequence of microscopic quantum- gravitational fluctuations in the space- time background .",
