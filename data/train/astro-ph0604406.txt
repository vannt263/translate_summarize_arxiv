    "we fit the spectrum of the rings in an annular region r , shown in figure [ fig : ringspecreg ] and listed in table [ tab : centralregs ] , with inner and outer radii of @xmath53 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the local background region for the rings ( also listed in table [ tab : centralregs ] ) was chosen concentric to and immediately outside the source to remove contamination from galaxy emission at larger radii as well as the virgo icm .",
    "we use an absorbed apec thermal plasma model ( smith et  al .",
    "2001 ) corrected for absorption using wisconsin photo - electric cross - sections ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) , with the absorbing column fixed at the galactic value of @xmath57@xmath58(dickey & lockman 1990 ) , to fit the resulting @xmath59 net source counts over the @xmath60kev energy range , where the source count rate was significantly above background .",

    "we checked that there were no significant differences between the spectra for the northern and southern rings by fitting the northern and southern halves of region r separately .",
    "we found the temperature and abundance of the northern ( southern ) ring to be @xmath61kev ( @xmath62kev ) and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 , respectively , for fixed galactic absorption . since the spectral fits for the northern and southern rings agreed within errors , we combined these regions into the single annular region r to improve statistics .    the best fit apec model spectral parameters for gas in the rings from this combined annular region ( region r ) are listed in the first row of table [ tab : ringfits ] .",
    "we find the temperature and abundance of gas in the rings to be @xmath65kev and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , respectively .",
    "thus the temperature of gas in the rings ( region r ) is a factor @xmath11 higher than that found for the surrounding ( @xmath68kev ) galaxy gas ( paper i ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the properties of a cold front , where the brighter region is cooler than its less bright surroundings ( viklinin et  al .",
    "2001 ; see also paper i and references therein ) or to the cool , bright rims of highly evolved remnant cavities from nuclear activity , such as those found in perseus ( fabian et  al .  2003 ) and in m87 ( forman et  al .",
    "2005 ) , but is similar to the properties observed in the x - ray edges produced by shocks driven into the ambient medium from recent agn outbursts , such as in hydra a ( nulsen et  al .  2005a , 2005b ) .",
    "we verified that the temperature rise in the rings can not be due to unresolved x - ray binaries in our data by adding a @xmath20kev bremsstrahlung component to our spectral model , as in paper i , and refitting the spectrum over the @xmath69kev energy range .",
    "the resulting best fit temperature ( @xmath70kev ) for the thermal component in this two component model agrees with the single component apec model results to within @xmath71 .",
    "the abundance of the gas ( @xmath72 ) is also in agreement , within the @xmath38cl model uncertainties , with that found using a single apec model .",
    "the @xmath1kev x - ray luminosity of region r is dominated by emission from galaxy gas , with the bremsstrahlung ( unresolved x - ray binary ) component contributing @xmath73 to the @xmath1kev luminosity in that region .",
    "this is in agreement with expectations for the residual contribution of unresolved x - ray binaries obtained from a direct integration of the average xlf for lmxb s ( gilfanov , 2004 ) below our @xmath74kev point source detection threshold ( @xmath75ergss@xmath5@xmath58 ) for region r. thus the effects of unresolved x - ray binaries on the measurement of the properties of the diffuse gas in the rings that are important for our analysis are small .",
    "although the uncertainties are large , the metallicity in the rings is consistent with that found in paper i for the outer regions of the galaxy .",
    "thus we find no evidence for a strong metallicity gradient across the rings .",
    "for completeness we list in table [ tab : ringfits ] the metallicity dependence of the @xmath1kev x - ray emissivity for gas in the rings over the abundance range ( @xmath76 ) of interest for ngc  4552 .          as shown in figure [ fig : ringsbcomp ] , the @xmath77kev surface brightness profiles across the northern and southern rims , taken in an angular sector centered on the nucleus extending from @xmath78 to @xmath79 for the northern rim and @xmath80 to @xmath81 for the southern rim ( measured counterclockwise from west in figure [ fig : ringimage ] ) ,",
    "agree within errors .",
    "thus we use the surface brightness profile across the northern rim as representative of the ring system .",
    "we use the multivariate minimization technique ( markevitch et  al .",
    "2000 ; vikhlinin et  al .",
    "2001 ) to determine the electron density inside the rim of the northern ring from the surface brightness profile shown in figure [ fig : sbprof ] .",
    "we assume a spherically symmetric power law distribution for the electron density for @xmath82 of the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the outer radius(rim ) of the ring , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the normalization and power law index , respectively , for the electron density of ngc  4552 inside the rim of the northern ring .",
    "the density model for ngc  4552 s gas outside the ring @xmath87 , determined by our analysis of the northern leading edge in paper i , is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89kpc , @xmath90 , and @xmath91@xmath92 . since ngc  4552 is much smaller than the projected @xmath93 separation between m87 and ngc  4552 , the contribution of the cluster icm to the surface brightness for radii @xmath94kpc ( inside the galaxy ) is nearly constant , varying by @xmath95 .",
    "we subtract this icm contribution from the surface brightness profile within ngc  4552 ( @xmath96kpc ) and fit the remaining galaxy emission , taking the position @xmath97 of the rim of the ring , the galaxy electron density power law indices @xmath86 , @xmath98 , and the discontinuity across the rim as free parameters .",
    "the discontinuity across the rim is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote the electron density and emissivity inside the rim of the northern ring , and @xmath102 and @xmath103 denote the corresponding properties of galaxy gas outside the rim .",
    "we find a best fit position for the discontinuity across the rim shown in figure [ fig : sbprof ] of @xmath104kpc , coincident with the rim ( outer radius ) of the northern ring in figure [ fig : ringimage ] , and slope @xmath105 for the electron density at @xmath106 .",
    "the slope of the electron density distribution for radii @xmath107 ( outside the rings ) was @xmath108 , consistent with our previous fit in paper i for the galaxy gas at large radii .",
    "assuming no strong abundance gradients in ngc  4552 and correcting for the @xmath109 difference in the galaxy gas cooling functions , caused by the difference in gas temperature between gas at large radii ( @xmath110kev , paper i ) and gas in the rings ( @xmath111kev for region r ) , we infer the density ratio across the rim of the northern ring to be @xmath112 .",
    "we extrapolate eq . [ eq : galouter ] to @xmath113kpc , the location of the rim of the northern ring , to evaluate @xmath102 at the discontinuity . then using the density discontinuity at the rim",
    ", we find the electron density just inside the rim to be @xmath114@xmath92 . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : sbprof ] , we plot the resulting normalized two power law density model for gas in ngc  4552 and the @xmath115-model for the surrounding virgo icm as a function of distance from the center of ngc  4552 .      since the temperature ( @xmath116kev ) and density ( @xmath114@xmath92 ) of gas in the inner rings are both greater than that for galaxy gas outside the rings ( @xmath117kev , @xmath118@xmath92 ) at @xmath119kpc , the properties of the rings are qualitatively consistent with resulting from a shock .",
    "for a monatomic ideal gas with adiabatic index @xmath120 , we can use the density discontinuity @xmath121 in the rankine - hugoniot shock conditions ( landau & lifschitz 1959 ) across the shock to estimate the shock speed ( mach number @xmath122 ) @xmath123 and predict discontinuities in temperature @xmath124 and pressure @xmath125 we can obtain an estimate for the density jump @xmath126 from the surface brightness discontinuity at the position of the rings .",
    "however , since the shock front is narrow , the averaged , measured surface brightness discontinuity will underestimate the actual density discontinuity at the narrow shock front , and thus also the inferred shock strength and temperature rise . from our fit to the inner surface brightness edge in  [ sec : ringdens ] , we infer a lower limit on the density discontinuity of @xmath127 . from equation [ eq : shockd ]",
    "this implies a shock mach number @xmath128 .",
    "for this mach number , the temperature and pressure increases predicted by equations [ eq : shockt ] and [ eq : shockp ] are @xmath129 and @xmath130 , in excellent agreement with our measured ratios of @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "thus the bright rings in figure [ fig : ringimage ] are shocks at the interface between the surrounding galaxy gas and two expanding cavities .",
    "numerical simulations have predicted that such features would be formed by high - momentum , subrelativistic bipolar nuclear outflows ( see e.g. reynolds et  al .",
    "2001 ; omma et  al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "an estimate for the age of these cavities is given by @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the mean radius of the cavity and @xmath135 is the sound speed in the ambient medium ( birzan et  al .",

    ", we find the cavities to be @xmath138myr old . a lower limit on the total mechanical energy @xmath139 carried in the outflow is given by the work @xmath140 needed to evacuate the two observed cavities , where @xmath141 is the mean pressure of the unshocked galaxy gas at each cavity s center and @xmath142 is the volume of the cavity . assuming spherical symmetry for each expanding cavity and extrapolating the density model in equation [ eq : galouter ] for unshocked galaxy gas outside the rings to the center of each cavity , we find the sum of the mechanical energy for the two cavities to be @xmath143ergs .",
    "this gives a lower limit on the average mechanical power for the outburst of @xmath144ergss@xmath5 .",
    "we use a simple , spherically symmetric , point explosion shock model to obtain a second estimate for the properties of the outflow .",
    "the details of this model and its uncertainties are discussed in nulsen et  al .",
    "( 2005a , 2005b ) .",
    "we briefly summarize that discussion here .",
    "the model shock is produced by a sudden deposition of energy in the central cell of the simulation .",
    "the model then uses gas hydrodynamical equations , including gravity , to numerically propagate the shock radially outward through the galaxy gas , assuming the unshocked galaxy atmosphere is isothermal , spherically symmetric with a power law density distribution , and in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "assuming the gas in ngc  4552 is in hydrostatic equilibrium , we use our fits to the outer region ( oa in paper i ) of ngc  4552 as representative of the temperature ( @xmath145kev ) and density distribution ( @xmath146 ) of the initially unshocked galaxy gas .",
    "we then compute surface brightness profiles from the model , using the _ chandra _ response in the @xmath1kev energy band , determined using xspec and an absorbed apec model for temperatures determined from the shock model , assuming a preshock temperature of @xmath145kev and detector responses appropriate to this observation .",
    "since the shock weakens as it hydrodynamically evolves , and the initial conditions are self - similar , we scale the model flow radially to the position of the observed shock .",
    "we then match the observed surface brightness profile to that of the model to determine the shock parameters .",
    "although this point explosion model will not reproduce the detailed ( bipolar ) geometry of the outflows , the model does provide a good description for the shape of the surface brightness profile across the rim and thus a reasonable measure of the mach number , and thus temperature jump , of the shock ( nulsen et  al .",
    "2005b ) .    in the left panel of figure [ fig : shckmod ]",
    "we see that the surface brightness profile across the rim of the northern ring in ngc  4552 is well represented by a shock model with mach number @xmath147 and shock radius of @xmath148kpc .",
    "the predicted , deprojected temperature profile across the shock front for the @xmath149 model is shown as the solid line in the right panel of figure [ fig : shckmod ] .",
    "the radial extent of region r ( @xmath150kpc ) , used to measure the temperature inside the rings , is much larger than the radial width of the shock .",
    "our measured temperature ( @xmath151kev from table [ tab : ringfits ] ) represents an average over this region and is in good agreement with the model results .",
    "projection effects also tend to reduce the observed temperature , since any given line of sight through the shock also passes through surrounding unshocked galaxy gas of lower temperature .",
    "the dashed line in the right panel shows the predicted emission - measure - weighted temperature profile @xmath152 for our mach @xmath3 model , taking into account the contribution from cooler preshocked galaxy gas along the line of sight .",
    "the emission - measure - weighted temperature profile rises sharply at the shock boundary , peaking at @xmath153kev , and then slowly decreases to @xmath154kev at @xmath155kpc , the inner radius of region r. this predicted profile is shifted up or down by @xmath156kev due to uncertainties in the temperature of the preshocked galaxy gas . since the model @xmath152 includes the contribution of unshocked galaxy gas at radii larger than that of the rings , that we subtracted as a local background in our previous fits to region r , we refit the spectrum for the rings in region r , for comparison with the model , using a @xmath157 rectangular region ( region vn in paper i ) centered at ( @xmath158 , @xmath159 ) with orientation angle of @xmath160 , comprising approximately @xmath161 of the area of the s3 chip , as the local background , to subtract only the virgo icm and particle backgrounds from the data .",
    "we find a mean temperature @xmath162kev and abundance @xmath163 ( @xmath164 ) for fixed galactic absorption .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the shock model prediction ( figure [ fig : shckmod ] , just behind the shock ) .",
    "we verified that this result was not biased by our choice of local background by refitting the spectrum using blank sky backgrounds appropriate for the date of observation and instrument configuration .",
    "when we used a second apec component to model the contribution of the virgo cluster gas , with temperature @xmath165kev and abundance @xmath166 fixed at the `` best - fit '' virgo cluster values from paper i , but with the normalization free to vary , we found no significant differences .",
    "the bipolar geometry of the outburst cavities , seen most clearly in the right panel of figure [ fig : ringimage ] , makes it difficult to probe the temperature profile inside the rims . to investigate this region ,",
    "we extract a combined spectrum from elliptical regions in the northern ( southern ) ring centered at @xmath167,@xmath168 ( @xmath169,@xmath170 ) with semi - major , minor axes and position angle ( a , b , pa ) of @xmath171kpc,@xmath172kpc,@xmath173 ( @xmath174kpc,@xmath175kpc,@xmath176 ) , respectively .",
    "we use these elliptical regions rather than a simple annular region inside the rings in order to avoid the region just outside the nucleus where , in projection , the bipolar ring rims appear to intertwine .",
    "we model the spectrum in xspec with an absorbed two component apec model , fixing the temperature and abundance of one apec component at the the temperature and abundance of the virgo cluster gas , as above , and hydrogen absorption at the galactic value .",
    "we find a mean temperature and abundance for galaxy gas averaged along the lines of sight passing through the interior of the cavities of @xmath177kev and @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) , respectively .",
    "this agrees within @xmath38 confidence with the mean temperature and abundance ( @xmath180kev , @xmath181 ) measured in the annular ring region r.    thus we do not observe the @xmath182 decline in temperature behind the shock that might have been expected from the model temperature profile in the right panel of figure [ fig : shckmod ] .",
    "this is not surprising for several reasons .",
    "first , both the ring and cavity spectral regions average over a broad range in radius .",
    "region r , with inner and outer radii of @xmath183 and @xmath37kpc , averages over @xmath184 of the radial distance from the shock rim to the nucleus , thus already averaging over the region where the temperature decline due to adiabatic expansion of gas behind the shock front should be greatest . similarly the elliptical regions for the cavities also sample a broad range in radius , that is further complicated by projection effects due to the bipolar geometry of the outflows . secondly , the model evolution of the gas temperature behind the shock front is sensitive to the density and temperature profile of the unshocked atmosphere .",
    "the unshocked gas density in galaxies typically follows a @xmath115-model profile , flattening in the core .",
    "thus it is strictly a power law only locally near the rim . also galaxy gas near the nucleus of ngc  4552 may not be isothermal",
    ". finally , the outflows are likely still driven by the ram - pressure of jet plasma from the initial agn outburst , that has effectively evacuated x - ray gas from a cocoon inside the shocked rims , rather than by a point explosion model .",
    "this would also affect the observed thermal properties of gas averaged over lines of sight passing through the cocoon. in particular , if the cavities are nearly devoid of x - ray gas , the emission will be dominated by the front and back edges of the cavities .",
    "additional discussion of these model uncertainties can be found in nulsen et  al .",
    "( 2005b ) .    nonetheless , the model does fit the surface brightness profile in the vicinity of the shock well ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : shckmod ] ) , such that the shock mach number is largely insensitive to the details of the model . consequently , the point explosion model estimates for the total mechanical energy and mean mechanical power carried in such outbursts are unlikely to err from their true values by more than a factor @xmath185 ( nulsen et  al .",
    "2005b ) . adopting a factor two as a conservative estimate for these model uncertainties",
    ", we now use the shock model fit to our data to determine the total mechanical energy and mean mechanical power required for the nuclear outburst observed in ngc  4552 .",
    "the elapsed time since the nuclear outburst ( shock age ) in the mach @xmath3 spherical shock model is @xmath37myr . since the simplified spherical model geometry overestimates the volume swept out by the observed shocks , the model predictions for the total mechanical energy @xmath139 carried in the shocks and thus also the mean mechanical power @xmath186 of the outburst are upper bounds on the properties of the observed outburst in ngc  4552 .",
    "we correct for this by including a geometrical factor @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is approximately the ratio of the volume filled by the observed cavities to that of the spherical model . for a mach @xmath3 shock ,",
    "we find @xmath189ergs and @xmath190ergss@xmath5 . assuming the observed cavities are well approximated by two spheres of radius @xmath191kpc",
    ", we find the fraction of the model volume filled by these cavitities is @xmath192 , such that the total mechanical energy and mean mechanical luminosity of the outburst are @xmath193ergs and @xmath194ergss@xmath5 , respectively , consistent with our previous estimate .",
    "we obtain an estimate of the total x - ray cooling rate for the galaxy ism by fitting a mean spectrum for ngc  4552 extracted from a @xmath195 ( @xmath196kpc ) circular region centered on the galaxy s nucleus , using a two component absorbed apec model with absorption fixed at galactic and one set of parameters fixed at the best fit virgo cluster parameters .",
    "we find a mean temperature ( @xmath197kev ) , abundance ( @xmath198 ) , and @xmath199kev flux of @xmath200ergss@xmath5@xmath58for ngc  4552 s ism component , in excellent agreement with results ( @xmath201kev , @xmath202ergss@xmath5@xmath58 ) by matsushita ( 2001 ) using rosat data . using the @xmath203kev luminosity as an estimate for the bolometric luminosity @xmath204 of the hot gas , we find @xmath205ergss@xmath5 .",
    "if we use a more realistic two component temperature model for the ism , consistent with our spectral results for the individual regions , this estimate of the total flux decreases by @xmath95 . therefore the energy carried in the observed nuclear outflows ( @xmath206ergs ) is sufficient to balance cooling of the galaxy ism for @xmath207myr .",
    "energetic outbursts could either be powered by supernovae from a compact circumnuclear region of star formation , i.e. in the central @xmath8 pc ( @xmath208 radius ) of the galaxy , or by an agn at the galaxy s center . assuming @xmath209ergs kinetic energy per supernova and @xmath210 supernova per @xmath211 of star formation ( mcnamara et  al .  2004 ; silk et  al .",
    "1986 ) , we would need @xmath212 supernova to provide the outburst energy of @xmath213ergs ( for @xmath214 ) .",
    "this would require a mean star formation rate , over the @xmath37myr age of the outburst , of @xmath215 within @xmath216pc of the nucleus .",
    "if we make the extreme assumption that all star formation in ngc  4552 occurs in this circumnuclear region , we can use the total uv emission of the galaxy at @xmath217 as a direct tracer of light from unabsorbed star formation , and the tir emission ( ir emission integrated over the @xmath218 band ) as a tracer of star formation in obscured dusty regions , to place a firm upper bound on the energy from star formation , that is available to power the observed outbursts . using ngc  4552 s uv luminosity , calculated from photometric data at @xmath217(ned ) in equation 1 from kennicut ( 1998 )",
    ", we find an unobscured star formation rate of @xmath219 ( @xmath220 ) for a continuous ( starburst ) star formation model .",
    "this is an order of magnitude below that needed to power the observed outburst .",
    "note that the unobscured star formation rate in the inner @xmath221pc nuclear region , calculated using the uv flux measured by maoz etal ( 2005 ) is very small , @xmath222 .",
    "this is consistent with the high brightness temperature and flat spectral shape of ngc4552 s radio emission that also argue against a dominant compact nuclear starburst or collection of supernovae remnants in the galaxy s core ( nagar et al 2002 ) .",
    "the tir luminosity provides a tracer of star formation in dusty regions , where the uv emission from young stars has been reprocessed to longer wavelengths by the surrounding dust . since dust in elliptical galaxies tends to be centrally concentrated , and",
    "dust has been identified in the inner @xmath223pc of ngc  4552 with hst observations ( van dokkum & franx , 1995 ) , this is likely a reasonable estimate for obscured star formation in the inner hundred parsecs of interest .",
    "we use the @xmath223 and @xmath224 fir flux densities for ngc  4552 from ned to calculate the fir luminosity ( wise et al .",
    "we convert the fir luminosity into the tir luminosity using a correction factor ( @xmath225 for @xmath226 ; helou et  al .",
    "1988 ) . then , using equation 4 in kennicutt ( 1998 ) , we find the star formation rate for obscured regions in ngc  4552 to be @xmath227 .",
    "summing the uv and tir star formation rates , we find a firm upper limit for circumnuclear star formation of @xmath228 , more than a factor of five below that needed to power the outburst .",
    "these low upper limits on current star formation in ngc  4552 are consistent with the @xmath229gyr average age of the galaxy s stellar population determined from optical line ratios by terlevich & forbes ( 2002 ) .",
    "thus the outburst is most likely powered by ngc  4552 s central agn .",
    "vlba measurements ( nagar et  al .  2002 ) show that ngc  4552 has a core radio source with two - sided east - west extended emission on @xmath29 milli - arcsecond scales .",
    "the radio spectrum is flat , with spectral index @xmath230 ( filho et  al .",
    "2004 ) , and radio flux densities of @xmath231 and @xmath232mjy at @xmath19 and @xmath20ghz , respectively . integrating this radio flux over the @xmath233 to @xmath234mhz frequency band",
    ", we find a total central radio power of @xmath235ergss@xmath5 .",
    "filho et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) argue that the properties of ngc  4552 s radio spectrum are most consistent with emission from accretion onto a @xmath236 black hole plus a self - absorbed compact jet or outflow .",
    "our observation of shocks produced by outflows from a previous episode of nuclear activity supports this model .",
    "furthermore , the mechanical luminosity , @xmath194ergss@xmath5(with factor @xmath185 uncertainty ) , found from our model fit to the observed shock in ngc  4552 , is consistent with mechanical luminosities inferred for cavities produced by agn outbursts in other systems . using @xmath237 systems , ranging in size from galaxy clusters to the elliptical galaxy m84 and containing well defined x - ray surface brightness depressions ( cavities ) , birzan et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) found a trend between the mechanical power @xmath238 needed to create the x - ray cavities and the current central radio power @xmath239 of the source , that they parameterized as a power law @xmath240 albeit with large scatter .",
    "the error on the mechanical luminosity in equation [ eq : birzan ] reflects the several orders of magnitude uncertainty due to scatter in their data . from equation [ eq : birzan ]",
    ", we expect the central radio source in ngc  4552 to produce outburst cavities with mechanical power @xmath241ergss@xmath5 , where again the errors reflect the uncertainty due to scatter in the data around the trend line .",
    "this is in good agreement with the mechanical power @xmath242ergss@xmath5found from our model fit to the observed shocks in ngc  4552 , where the errors in our observed value reflect the factor two uncertainty in the shock model results .",
    "finally , we look briefly at the x - ray properties of the nuclear region by modeling the spectrum from a @xmath208 circular region ( ns ) centered at ( @xmath13 , @xmath243 ) containing the nuclear source ( see table [ tab : centralregs ] ) . after local background subtraction using a concentric annular region with inner and outer radii of @xmath244 and @xmath245 ,",
    "respectively , the spectrum contains @xmath246 net source counts in the @xmath69kev energy band .",
    "an acceptable fit to the data ( @xmath247 ) was found using an absorbed power law model with moderate hydrogen absorption ( @xmath248@xmath58 ) and steep ( @xmath249 ) photon index .",
    "the fits were improved and the photon index softened to @xmath250 ( see table [ tab : nucfits ] ) by adding a second , thermal apec component to the model and fixing the hydrogen absorption for both thermal and powerlaw components at the galactic value ( @xmath251@xmath58 ) .",
    "for these two component models , we first allow the temperature , metal abundance and photon index to vary , but find the abundance is poorly constrained .",
    "we then fix the metal abundance at @xmath252 from the best fit spectral model for the ring region @xmath134 of ngc  4552 ( see the first line in table [ tab : ringfits ] ) , and find the fit is unchanged , although the errors on the photon index are modestly reduced .",
    "we checked the stability of this two component fit by allowing the absorbing column to vary and found @xmath253 consistent with the galactic value .",
    "in the two component model , we find a photon index @xmath254 and temperature @xmath255kev .",
    "the power law photon index is consistent with those expected for low luminosity agns ( terashima & wilson 2003 ; filho et  al .",
    "the temperature for the thermal component is higher than that found for gas in any other region of the galaxy , suggesting that we may be directly observing the reheating of the galaxy ism by the nuclear outburst .",
    "we find intrinsic total @xmath1 and @xmath33kev x - ray fluxes in this model to be @xmath256ergss@xmath5@xmath58and @xmath257ergss@xmath5@xmath58 , corresponding to @xmath258kev and @xmath33kev luminosities of @xmath259ergss@xmath5and @xmath260ergss@xmath5 .",
    "the power law component dominates the emission in both energy bands , contributing @xmath261 and @xmath262 of the emission in the @xmath1 and @xmath263kev bandpasses , respectively .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the spectral results of filho et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) for a circular region @xmath264 in diameter surrounding the nucleus with data extracted from the same _ chandra _ observation ( obsid 2072 ) used in this work .    since the nuclear source is known to be variable at the @xmath21 level for the @xmath17 and @xmath265 cm radio flux on timescales @xmath210yr ( nagar et  al .",
    "2002 ) and by a similar amount in the uv at @xmath217 and @xmath266 on timescales of @xmath185 months ( maoz et  al .",
    "2005 ) , it is interesting to look for x - ray variability .",
    "we examined the light curve for a @xmath267 radius circular region centered on the nucleus ( @xmath13 , @xmath243 ) over the @xmath47kev energy range using @xmath268ks binning , and found that , on these timescales , the nuclear count rate varied by @xmath269 ( @xmath270 ) during the @xmath271ks observation .",
    "we then searched for variability on any scale using an application of the gregory - loredo algorithm ( 1992 ) on the unbinned events time series .",
    "we only found possible variability in the lowest order @xmath272 moment ( @xmath273 , with the normalized odds ratio of @xmath274 ) , consistent with a slow ( @xmath275 ) increase in the mean signal over the duration of this observation .",
    "the gregory - loredo analysis failed to find any statistically significant evidence for variability on shorter timescales , i.e. in the @xmath276 moments .",
    "thus we find no statistical evidence in these data to support the claim by xu et  al .",

    "in this work we analysed a @xmath0ks _ chandra _ observation of the elliptical galaxy ngc  4552 in the virgo cluster and found x - ray evidence for shocks in the inner region of the galaxy from a recent nuclear outburst .",
    "two ring - like emission features , consistent with bipolar nuclear outflow cavities , are found in the x - ray images at @xmath277kpc from ngc  4552 s center .",
    "the emission measure weighted gas temperature through the rings ( @xmath278kev ) and the shape of the surface brightness profile across the rim of the northern ring are consistent with a simple spherical model for a mach @xmath3 shock from a @xmath213ergs nuclear outburst @xmath279myr ago .",
