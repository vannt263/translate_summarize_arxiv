    "predicting , controlling and finely tuning the self - assembly properties of amphiphiles through molecular design is a problem of central importance in physical chemistry.@xcite it is arguably also one of its major contributions to other fields : in the biological realm , where self - assembled phospholipids build the walls of liposomes and cells ; in cosmetics , pharmaceutics or detergency , where many formulations are self - assembled solutions of surfactants , phospholipids and other amphiphile molecules . in this context ,",
    "diblock copolymers have emerged as a paradigm for self - assembly.@xcite typically , the insoluble block drives the chains to self - associate and the compositional asymmetry between the soluble and insoluble blocks defines the assembling geometry.@xcite the many possibilities for architecture building offered by polymer synthesis and the development of polymer theory led to an unprecedented power of molecular control over the self - assembling structures of these so called macrosurfactants .",
    "it is nowadays possible , for instance , to build different self - assembled structures from diblock , triblocks and many other block copolymers , to introduce charges at different places along the chains with single charge accuracy , to form reversible or frozen structures , to combine flexible and semi - flexible blocks , _",
    "etc_. however , a major difficulty still hinders progresses in the predictive power of micellization theories .",
    "indeed , the macromolecular character of such surfactants implies that there is a large kinetic barrier for micelle formation , and the thermodynamic predictions for typical quantities such as the critical micellar concentration or the aggregation number are in many cases only marginally relevant . in this paper",
    "we discuss a novel macrosurfactant architecture , based on rotaxane inclusion complexes,@xcite that can lead to a significant decrease of the kinetic barrier to micellization .     and",
    "@xmath0 , respectively , b ) small symmetric micelles and c ) big asymmetric micelles.,width=188 ]    rotaxanes are molecular complexes formed when a ring like molecule , the rotor , is threaded over a linear molecule , the rotating axis.@xcite unthreading of the ring can be prevented by subsequent capping of the axis ends.@xcite rotaxanes can be made by combining different linear polymers@xcite with different cyclic molecules , in several solvents.@xcite one of the most well studied systems involve poly(ethylene - oxide ) and @xmath1-cyclodextrins , which are oligosaccharides of @xmath2 glucose units assembled as rings .",
    "when an inclusion complex formed by one @xmath1-cyclodextrin and one peo chain is attached to a surface by grafting the @xmath1-cd , it results a novel structure of polymer layers for which we recently@xcite coined the acronym sgp layers , for sliding grafted polymer layers .",
    "contrary to the usual end - grafted polymer layer , in the sgp layers the chains retain the ability to slide through the grafting ring , a new degree of freedom that allows , as we recently have shown , to better relax the layer structure .",
    "in particular , our work suggests that in spherical , star - like layers , as obtained for instance if one attaches the @xmath1-cd ring to a small colloid , sliding of the polymers through the ring entails a truly versatile polymer layer structure . at low number of grafts",
    "the chains adopt mostly symmetric configurations with two comparable arm - sizes whereas with many grafts the adopted configurations are asymmetric with essentially one long arm participating in the corona .",
    "it was also shown that there exists an intermediate range of grafting numbers where the number of arms participating in the corona is constant and where the addition of more grafts leads to the progressive replacement of symmetric configurations by twice as much asymmetric ones .",
    "conversely , in flat dense sgp layers , chains adopt only asymmetric configurations , having hence the same structure as the quenched ones .",
    "an important consequence for self assembly is that the free energy of the curved sgp layers has a different structure from the usual polymer layers grafted to spherical surfaces , but that the free energy of flat sgp layers only marginally differs from their non - sliding equivalents .",
    "we consider the micellization of decorated `` one - pearl necklaces '' where the driving force for self - assembly is provided by the bead decoration , an insoluble chain chemically attached to the ring molecule ( see figure slidmic ) .",
    "the consequences of the sliding degree of freedom on the self - assembly of sliding polymeric surfactants are discussed by focusing on curved self - assembled structures , since for flat self - assembled layers only marginal differences are expected with the usual grafted layers . after a short reminder on diblock - copolymer micellization , we recall the theoretical description of the spherical sgp layer , before a detailed discussion of the possible micellization scenarios for this new family of macrosurfactant architectures ( figure [ slidmic ] ) .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss the theory of micellization of block copolymers , see _",
    "e.g. _ ref . .",
    "consider a solution of monodisperse block copolymer with @xmath0 insoluble and @xmath3 soluble units .",
    "the insoluble blocks tend to aggregate and favor large aggregates while coronas of soluble blocks oppose the formation of big micelles .",
    "the free energy per unit volume @xmath4 , of the solution of non - interacting micelles is a sum running over the aggregation number @xmath5 : @xmath6\\]]where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the free energy and the number density of a micelle comprising @xmath5 surfactant chains respectively .",
    "the multiplier @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the total volume of a copolymer.@xcite this multiplier was often overlooked , a general discussion is provided by riess,@xcite who gives the relevant elementary volume , in our case @xmath11 , for microemulsions , assemblies of droplets , etc . the equilibrium distribution of chains in micelles is obtained by minimizing @xmath12 with respect to @xmath8 along with the mass conservation constraint : @xmath13where @xmath14 is the total number of chains per unit volume .",
    "this gives the equilibrium densities of @xmath5-arm micelles in the form @xmath15 , where : @xmath16is the chemical potential of unimers .     as a function of total concentration for quenched ( dashed line ) and sliding ( solid line ) micelles .",

[ distribution ] allows us to calculate the whole distribution @xmath8 and the corresponding total chain concentration @xmath14 .",
    "experimentally , the chemical potential @xmath24 is often studied as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "we obtained the chemical potential curve from eqs.(phi)-([distribution ] ) with @xmath25 as the parameter .",
    "a kink in the representation ( figure [ mus ] , dashed line ) is commonly used as an indicator for the onset of micellization .",
    "usually only a narrow range of unimer concentrations at equilibrium @xmath25 falls in the physically acceptable condition : @xmath26 .",
    "when no interaction between micelles is accounted for , the more stringent criterion @xmath27 should be obeyed where @xmath28 is the volume of a micelle comprising @xmath5 surfactants .",
    "the micellization scenario depends on the precise form of the free energy @xmath29 , discussed in the following paragraphs for quenched copolymers and annealed sliding copolymers .",
    "the free energy of a micelle contains the molecular characteristics of the micellization process .",
    "thus , in order to investigate the micellization of sliding polymer surfactants , we have to specify the explicit form for the corresponding @xmath7 .",
    "the free energy of a micelle is the sum of the core and of the corona contributions .",
    "hereafter energies are expressed in @xmath30 units .",
    "we assume that the insoluble blocks form a dense homogeneous core where soluble blocks and the solvent can not penetrate .",
    "hence the micelle free energy has two core contributions : ( i ) the surface tension term , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the radius of the core and @xmath33 is the core - solvent surface tension expressed in @xmath34 units . for an incompressible core of size @xmath35 , this leads to @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "( ii ) gaussian elastic contributions arising from stretching of the insoluble blocks in the core , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 reflects the spherical geometry of the core .",
    "the value of @xmath40 is obtained from scf theory in the strong stretching limit.@xcite although the elastic contribution of the core is only larger than @xmath30 for micelles with large cores , we keep it for convenience.@xcite      for large soluble blocks , as considered here , the corona is usually envisioned as a star of soluble blocks radially stretched away from the spherical core .",
    "the partition function @xmath41 of a star with @xmath5 equal arms of contour length @xmath3 is given by the critical exponent @xmath42 , @xmath43.@xcite star exponents @xmath44 are known exactly in two dimensions and for ideal chains ( @xmath45 ) . in three dimensions @xmath46 -expansions ( @xmath47 )",

    "results to the daoud and cotton model , say between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where the simulated arms are still fairly long , the obtained amplitude is close to @xmath52 .",
    "it seems that the asymptotic limit , restricted to the leading term , is also out of experimental reach .",
    "authors showed that the best fit of the simulation data with a power law @xmath53 is obtained with @xmath54 .",
    "our discussion below is based on the simulation data and we will use , for convenience , the fitting function of the form close to eq .",
    "( [ epsi ] ) : @xmath55 reflecting the simulation results .",
    "the best fit is    @xmath56    while for @xmath57 we take values from the table of ref . .",
    "when there is sliding degree of freedom , the free energy of the corona has a more complex structure . the possibility for the soluble blocks to slide through a ring results in an annealed arm length distribution in the coronas of such micelles made of @xmath5-chains .",
    "adjusting the length of the arm in the corona can decrease the crowding effect originating from the steric repulsions between soluble blocks . in our previous paper@xcite",
    "we found three possible regimes for the sliding coronas depending on the number of sliding chains per aggregate .",
    "the transition between these regimes is determined from a threshold value of the number of arms @xmath58 , defined by the conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "if the number of chains per aggregate is small , @xmath61 , the corona is fully annealed and the sliding chains are likely to adopt any configuration .",
    "we call such micelles symmetric micelles , since symmetric configurations are prevalent .",

    "the corona has @xmath58 arms and its partition function reads    @xmath66    for even larger micelles , @xmath67 , all the chains in the corona are strongly asymmetric and the partition function of the corona coincide with the partition function of a quenched star :    @xmath68     as a function of the aggregation number @xmath5 for sliding micelles ( solid line , total surfactant concentration @xmath69 ) and for quenched micelles ( dashed line , @xmath70 , dash - dotted line , @xmath69 , same as for sliding micelles ) for the set of parameters : @xmath17 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "micelles form almost without kinetic barrier from sliding polymer surfactants.,width=283 ]    the determination of the threshold value of the number of arms @xmath58 strongly depends on our knowledge of the values of the critical exponents @xmath73 .",
    "our previous estimates@xcite were based on the first order @xmath46-expansion ( eq . [ epsi ] ) yielding @xmath74 .",
    "however , if we use the values obtained from the computer simulations in ref .",
    ", we get @xmath75 . thus , in the following we assume the latter estimate as most accurate .",
    "we use our fitting function ( [ gam ] ) for the values of @xmath42 , and the free energy of the sliding corona of a micelle @xmath76 is determined as a piecewise function of the number of chains @xmath5 .      combining all terms together ,",
    "the energy of a micelle is given by    @xmath77    with @xmath78where @xmath79 is defined piecewise by eqs.([smallp],[intermediatep],[largep ] ) as discussed in the previous section for sliding copolymers whereas for quenched copolymers : @xmath80 .",
    "note that the corona free energy of sliding surfactant unimers ( @xmath81 ) is @xmath82 while that of the quenched unimer is @xmath83 .",
    "thus the free energy of sliding surfactant is about @xmath84 less than that of quenched ones with the same soluble block size .",
    "next we use the expressions of the free energy @xmath85 to compute the micelle size distribution for both quenched and sliding copolymers .",
    "a preferred aggregation number is reflected by a minimum in the potential @xmath86 . roughly speaking",
    ", the corresponding aggregates will dominate over unimers if the minimum potential value is negative . for usual quenched copolymers",
    "the potential has only one , pretty sharp , minimum ( see figure omegas ) and the polydispersity of spherical micelles is usually very low , the distribution @xmath8 being sharply peaked around the average aggregation number @xmath87 . in this sense , quenched copolymer association should be termed @xmath88 association where the distribution is dominated by aggregates of uniform size with weak fluctuations appearing at a well defined unimer concentration . in the common used classification , @xmath89 association means that aggregates of different sizes significantly contribute to the distribution and appear gradually .",
    "the practical relevance of this classification has been critically discussed recently.@xcite    the average aggregation number and the _ cmc _ are found from the conditions : @xmath90.@xcite the minimum is separated from the origin by a kinetic barrier . thus it takes a typical time @xmath91 for isolated chains to form a micelle ; with @xmath92 the maximum of the barrier .",
    "a rough scaling estimate gives @xmath93.@xcite depending on the conditions , this time for usual block copolymer micelles can be very large .",
    "very often , quenched copolymer micelles do not form over reasonable time scales at the _ cmc _ , where they are thermodynamically favored .",
    "only at much higher concentrations , the barrier @xmath94 becomes low ( see figure [ omegas ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the quenched case , the potential @xmath95 ( eq . ( [ omega ] ) ) for sliding micelles can have two minima .",
    "one corresponds to small symmetric micelles with aggregation numbers up to @xmath96 , and the second corresponds to big asymmetric micelles ( figure omegas ) .",
    "the appearance of small micelles leads to a drastic decrease of the kinetic barrier , such that the first minimum is separated from the origin by a barrier of order @xmath97 signifying the fast formation of equilibrium micelles .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath24 of sliding copolymers as a function of @xmath14 presents a rounded kink as compared to the quenched case ( figure [ mus ] ) .    depending on molecular parameters of the system ,",
    "the formation of small micelles can follow ( figure [ example]a and [ example]c ) or precede ( figure [ example]b and [ example]d ) the formation of big micelles .",
    "typical examples of the mass distribution in micelles , @xmath98 , with increasing polymer concentration are shown in figure [ cp ] .",
    "the equilibrium aggregation number switches between symmetric ( small ) and asymmetric ( big ) micelles as the concentration increases . tuning the parameters of the system ,",
    "either the surface tension of the core , @xmath33 , or the relative length of the blocks ( in our case we vary @xmath0 keeping @xmath99 constant ) , we can change the order of the appearance of small and big micelles . figure [ diagram ] shows the corresponding state diagram which is related to figure [ x ] .",
    "when big and small micelles coexist the big ones usually dominate by mass .",
    "hence we represent the boundary between big and big+small micelles by a dashed line .     for different set of parameters : a ) @xmath17 , @xmath100 , @xmath72 , @xmath101 , b ) @xmath17 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , c ) @xmath105 , @xmath100 , @xmath72 , @xmath106 , d ) @xmath107 , @xmath100 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",

    "the aggregation number of a vanishing minimum of this approximate potential ( for some chemical potential ) is then solution of the following equation : @xmath110the left hand side of this equation @xmath111 collects all the terms depending on @xmath5 .",
    "thus , in this approximation the desired aggregation numbers depend only on the combination of parameters @xmath112 .",
    "it is easy to see that in the quenched copolymer case there is indeed only one solution of @xmath87 and in the daoud - cotton limit @xmath113 , a classical result .",
    "it is worthwhile discussing the number of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ apprpm ] ) as a function of the parameter @xmath114 for sliding copolymers .",

    "there is only one intersection .",
    "it corresponds to one minimum in @xmath116 .",
    "the number of arms @xmath5 is small , thus this region corresponds to the coexistence of unimers with small symmetric micelles . in the region @xmath117 there are three intersections showing the existence of two minima separated by a barrier .",

    "when the size of insoluble blocks is not too long , both small micelles ( with an aggregation number slightly smaller than @xmath132 ) and large micelles ( with an aggregation number slightly larger than @xmath75 ) may coexist in the solution . in the small micelle",
    "each copolymer participates in the corona with two arms whereas in the large micelle the asymmetric arm length distribution is dominant .",
    "hence coronas in small and large micelles comprise a similar number of arms .",
    "small micelles can form without appreciable kinetic barrier at the lowest concentration where they are thermodynamically favored .",
    "the barrier opposing the formation of the larger micelle remains modest .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the corresponding quenched copolymers where kinetic barriers are very high at the same concentrations . which micelle appears first with increasing concentration depends on the block asymmetry .",
    "at somewhat higher concentrations , the micelle - size - distribution broadens and covers the whole range from the small to the large aggregation number described previously .    for large insoluble blocks only the large micelles , similar to the quenched ones , form .",
    "due to the loss of the sliding degree of freedom upon association , the annealed _ cmc _ is higher than the quenched one . on the other hand",

    "some charged micelles can also display a similar behavior as reported by zhulina and borisov for insoluble / annealed - polyelectrolyte diblocks.@xcite to our knowledge only flat brushes of complexing polymers have been studied theoretically.@xcite diblocks where the soluble block forms a complex with small colloids ( proteins ) also belong to the class of annealed copolymers .",
    "one may speculate whether such diblocks also form two types of micelles ."
