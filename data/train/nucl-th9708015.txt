    "this analysis of elastic nn scattering data updates our previous analysis@xcite to 1.6  gev in the laboratory kinetic energy .",
    "the present analysis extends to 2.5  gev , which is the limit for elastic @xmath1 differential cross sections measured@xcite by the edda collaboration using the cooler synchrotron at cosy .",
    "measurements with a laboratory kinetic energy near 2 gev are particularly interesting as they correspond to a center - of - mass energy ( 2.7  gev ) which has been suggested@xcite for a broad dibaryon resonance . near this energy ,",
    "a sharp structure has been recently reported in the polarization observable @xmath2@xcite , and this was taken as support for such a resonance .",
    "a resonancelike structure , at about the same energy , has also been reported in a partial - wave analysis by hoshizaki@xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite have considered this possibility , but find no evidence for a resonant excursion in their unpolarized cross sections .",
    "polarization measurements expected from saturne ii and cosy will certainly help to clarify this issue .",
    "our previous @xmath0 scattering analyses@xcite were based on about 13,000 @xmath1 and about 11,000 @xmath3 data . in ref.@xcite the @xmath1 analysis extended up to a laboratory kinetic energy of 1.6  gev ; the @xmath3 analysis was truncated at 1.3  gev .",
    "the present database@xcite is considerably larger due both to an expanded energy range for the @xmath1 system and the addition of new data at lower energies .",
    "the database above 1.6 gev is mainly comprised of cross section measurements , much of these coming from the edda collaboration@xcite . from this source",
    ", we have added differential cross sections ranging from 540  mev to 2520  mev in the proton kinetic energy and from 35@xmath4 to 90@xmath4 in the cm scattering angle . in constructing the database extension from 1600 to 2500  mev",
    ", we reexamined a number of references in order to include higher energy data which had previously been neglected .",
    "this search netted additional data mainly from anl ( 450 points ) and saclay ( about 900 points ) .",
    "the @xmath3 database has not been increased significantly and , as a result , we did not extend our analysis of the i  =  0 system .",
    "new @xmath3 polarized data have been produced mainly by triumf ( 100 points ) .",
    "more details regarding a total database , it can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "our first attempts to extend the range of the @xmath0 analysis used the parameterization scheme of ref.@xcite .",
    "these were unsuccessful .",
    "the problem was traced to the basis functions used to expand our k - matrix elements .",
    "many of these become nearly degenerate as the kinetic energy of the incoming nucleon increases to 2.5 gev . as a result , a modified form was used in the present analysis . apart from this difference , the formalism used here is identical to that used in ref.@xcite .",
    "the reader is directed to refs.@xcite for details .",
    "our single - energy and energy - dependent ( sm97 ) results for the dominant isovector and isoscalar partial - wave amplitudes are displayed in fig .",
    "1 and fig .  2 .",
    "( single - energy analyses were done in order to search for structures which may be missing from the energy - dependent fit . ) here we also compare with our previous fit ( sm94 ) . in some cases , the changes are quite large .",
    "this is particularly true near the upper energy limit of sm94 , and for the smaller partial waves .",
    "the effect of these changes can be clearly seen in fig .  3 , where we show how well the new edda data@xcite are reproduced by both sm94 and sm97 .",
    "the influence of this experiment is most pronounced in the forward direction above 800  mev .    in general , we find little structure over the higher energy region .",
    "this reflects the smooth , and rather flat , total and reaction cross sections between 1.5  gev and 2.5  gev .",
    "our fit to these quantities is displayed in fig .",
    "note that the reaction cross sections were excluded from our fit .",
    "this verifies that the set of total , total elastic ( deduced from differential cross sections ) , and reaction cross sections are self - consistent .",
    "the present analysis actually gives an improved fit to the data below 1.6  gev .",
    "this is due to the altered basis set , found necessary to fit the higher energy data .",
    "numerical comparisons are given in table  1 .",
    "here we see that the cosy data@xcite comprise a large fraction of the total set above 1.6  gev .",
    "the results of analyses with ( sm97 ) and without ( nm97 ) this data set show how influential these measurements have been in determining the amplitudes .",
    "( the fits sm97 and nm97 used identical parameterization schemes . only the database was changed . )",
    "the cosy data contribute a @xmath5/datum of 1.07 from sm97 and 5.6 from nm97 .",
    "the net @xmath5 increased by 3498 when 2121 cosy data were added to nm97 and then re - analysed to produce sm97 .",
    "although our fit ( sm97 ) is parameterized to be devoid of the resonance - like structures conjectured to lie around 2  gev , it is possible to add such structures and then look for those observables which are most sensitive to such an inclusion . in fig .",
    "5 we illustrate how a @xmath6 structure at @xmath7 = 2.7  gev ( elastic width is @xmath8 = 16  mev , inelastic width is @xmath9 = 67  mev ) would affect @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we have extended our @xmath1 partial - wave analyses nearly 1  gev beyond the limit quoted in our previously published results@xcite .",
    "the present range has been selected to include all of the recent elastic @xmath1 cross section data measured by the edda group@xcite .",
    "we found that it was possible to simultaneously fit the @xmath1 total cross section data , in particular the precise data of ref.@xcite , along with differential cross sections from the edda collaboration@xcite .",
    "the resulting reaction cross sections , which were not included in the fit , are quite well reproduced . the predicted reaction cross sections are consistent with the results of ref.@xcite at lower energies , but deviate from these and follow the results of ref.@xcite above 1  gev . while we find that the partial - wave amplitudes above 1.6  gev are smooth and structureless , reflecting the behavior seen in the total and elastic cross section data , we have also considered the effect of more localized structures reported in polarization measurements@xcite . as the high energy region",
    "was constrained mainly by cross section data , the present solution should be considered as a guide to the expected amplitudes .",
