    "the pp - wave solution of type iib supergravity has 32 supersymmetries and can be obtained as a penrose limit of @xmath5 @xcite . while the application of the ads / cft correspondence in the usual @xmath6 background is difficult to go beyond the supergravity approximation on the string theory side , the string worldsheet theory in the pp - wave background is exactly solvable , as shown by @xcite .",

    "open strings attached to giant gravitons are described in @xcite . ] in this paper for simplicity we will only consider free yang mills theory , i.e. we set @xmath10 , so the only expansion parameter is @xmath9 .",
    "also there will be no anomalous conformal dimensions in this case and we do not need to consider operator mixing .",
    "it is proposed in @xcite that the interaction amplitude for a single string to split into two strings ( or two strings joining into one string ) is related to the three point function of the corresponding operators in the dual cft . using this relation the authors in @xcite are able to compute the second order correction to the anomalous dimension of the bmn operator from free planar three point functions and found exact agreement with computation of the field theory torus contributions to the two point function .",

    "the readers can easily check ( note diagrams @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 have double contributions ) @xmath112 this is expected since higher genus contributions to the correlators of chiral operators are the same regardless of the number of supergravity excitations @xcite . in the appendix [ cancellation ] we compute the case @xmath107,@xmath12 and find all diagrams cancel , as expected from the genus 2 two point function equation ( c.36 ) in @xcite .",

    "it would be interesting to perform more detailed calculations as pointed out in the text or try to give a general analytic proof of these mathematical identities at arbitrary genus .",
    "it is also interesting to generalize the results to interacting field theory . in this case",

    ". it would be interesting to use their results to do the calculations and compare with non - planar contributions to correlators in interacting yang mills theory .",
    "but we should caution the readers the relation between three point vertex in field theory and string theory is still unclear at nonzero @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the three point vertex in pp - wave light cone string field theory is a very complicated smoothly interpolating function which involves fractional powers in small @xmath113 expansion @xcite .",
    "the natural question to ask is what we are really doing here .",
    "can we interpret the discovered identities as consequences of pp - wave / cft correspondence , or are they just mathematical coincidence and possibly related to some unknown properties of field theory itself ?",
    "the answer is not convincingly clear at this point although we have been inclined to the former explanation .",
    "one possible interpretation is wave function renormalization . while the authors in @xcite computed energy correction , what we did in section [ twopoint1 ] looks like wave function renormalization in quantum mechanics .",
    "remember in quantum perturbation theory the first order wave function renormalization is @xmath114 in string field theory the matrix elements contain a prefactor which exactly cancels @xmath115 in the denominator @xcite .",
    "that is why we never need to use energies in our calculation .",
    "but in this framework it is hard to explain the factor of @xmath42 there and all other calculations in section [ cubic ] and section [ twopoint2 ] besides the fact that we do nt know why the free torus two point function should correspond to wave function renormalization on the string theory side .",
    "despite lack of interpretations , our calculations nevertheless set up computational rules to get the right answer and indeed point out a clear correspondence on both sides .",
    "our calculations may help to better understand of the question of holography , which has been address in previous works @xcite .",
    "but this question is still unclear .",
    "we do not yet have a clear prescription of what is the correspondence between the bulk and boundary as we did in the context of ads / cft ( by witten diagram ) .",
    "our calculations would provide some sense as to what specifically do we need to compare on both sides",
    ". it would be interesting to further study this question .",
    "we thank vijay balasubramanian and asad naqvi for collaborations at early stage of the project and for readings of the manuscript .",
    "we are also grateful to thomas s. levi , gary shiu and matt strassler for illuminating discussions .",
    "in this appendix we give a practical prescription for deriving symmetry factors of string theory diagrams we computed .",
    "we have considered two cases of one loop propagation diagrams and one loop cubic diagrams where the countings are relatively simple ( for two point functions at genus 2 level we would need to count 21 field theory diagrams @xcite ) .",
    "we denote a close string with n segments by @xmath116 , where the string are regarded as the same by cyclic rotation .",
    "for example , @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the same string .",
    "we denote the processes of string splitting and joining by @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "now imagine figure [ f3 ] as a string of 4 segments goes from @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "how many ways can we do this with our rules ?",
    "a little counting reveal that at one loop level there are only two processes as the following @xmath122 here since @xmath123 and @xmath124 , @xmath125 and ( 43 ) are the same , we can join @xmath126 in to @xmath121 .",
    "these two processes are exactly one loop string propagation diagrams in figure [ f2 ] .",
    "thus we conclude we have overcounted by a factor of @xmath44 when we do string theory diagram calculations .",
