    "single photon detectors ( spd ) are important devices in many research fields , such as optical quantum computing @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite , spectroscopy , fluorescence lifetime measurements @xcite , and light detection and ranging ( lidar ) @xcite .",
    "the telecom wavelength range around 1500 nm is of particular interest for various reasons .",
    "for example , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) via optical fiber must operate at the lowest photon transmission loss at 1550 nm in order to achieve the longest distance .",
    "spds can be operated in two distinct modes : gated @xcite or free running @xcite .",
    "free running detectors are very important in certain applications , particularly where photons arrive in a random fashion , rather than synchronized on a regular clock time basis .",
    "for example , this is the case for photon pairs produced by spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) with a continuous wave pump .    in the telecom wavelength range there",
    "exist several good candidates for free running spds , including photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) @xcite , passively quenched inp / ingaas spads @xcite , shallow junction silicon spads using frequency upconversion @xcite , transition edge sensors ( tes)@xcite , and superconducting nanowire single photon detectors ( snspds ) @xcite .",
    "the snspds currently have the best overall performance , such as low darkcount rates ( dcr @xmath4 100 hz ) and good timing jitter ( @xmath4 65 ps ) .",
    "however , owing to their superconducting temperature requirements ( under 4.2 k ) , cryogenic systems are required .",
    "moreover , the detection efficiency ( de ) of snspds is dependent on the polarization of the input photons@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "negative feedback avalanche diodes ( nfads ) , a recently developed type of inp / ingaas apd ( princeton lightwave inc ) , can be operated in free running mode without cryogenic temperatures .",
    "these devices possess an integrated passive quenching resistor that minimize the amount of avalanche charges produced by a photon detection ( another approach to self - quenching in inp - based single photon apds , which employs epitaxial barriers as a negative feedback mechanism @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , these apd detectors have no de dependency on the input photon polarization .    the darkcount rate and timing jitter of nfad detectors arise from some intrinsic material properties and the device structure .",
    "their darkcount rates are induced by the size of their avalanche region , as well as the trap - assisted tunneling effect@xcite ( tat ) .",
    "timing jitter is generally dominated by the stochastic nature of the avalanche breakdown process . however , the external operation setup can be optimized to achieve a high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and good time resolution .",
    "we developed a novel readout system for the nfads , which features ( a ) very low operating temperature ; and ( b ) minimal avalanche charges required to trigger the readout circuit .",
    "this allows our system to achieve ultra low darkcount rates .",
    "the significant features of our readout method are : first , the nfad operates in a genuine free running mode ; there is no active quenching circuitry involved to impose additional deadtime ( which is usually needed to suppress the afterpulsing effect and to lower darkcount rates ) ; second , a pulse transformer is employed to isolate the nfad bias circuitry from the high speed rf amplifiers to read out the photon electric signals . instead of conventional capacitive coupling , we use inductive coupling , so that only the variation of the avalanche current is coupled to the external amplifier .",
    "this dramatically improves the sensitivity of the readout .    in this work two different nfad devices",
    "are studied@xcite .",
    "detector i / nfad 1 ( model no .",
    "e2g6 ) has a feedback resistor of 1.1 m@xmath5 and a diameter of 22 @xmath6 m .",
    "detector ii / nfad 2 ( model no .",
    "e3g3 ) has the same nominal feedback resistor , but a larger device diameter of 32 @xmath6 m .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we start with the experimental setup and device details . then the  simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis \" ( spice ) model of our readout circuit including the nfad equivalent circuit is simulated and compared with the experimental results .",
    "this is followed by a measurements of the de , which is later verified using two nfads to detect photon pairs generated by spdc .",
    "next the results from the afterpulsing , deadtime , and timing jitter measurements are presented .",
    "lastly , we study the feasibility of using our nfads to perform entangled photon qkd over distances of more than 400 km .",
    "[ fig : system_design ] depicts the detailed design of our in - house developed readout circuit .",
    "the entire system is comprised of two parts .",
    "the nfad and its bias circuitry is inside a deep freezer ( global cooling , ult-25 ) with a lowest base temperature of 187  k. at this base temperature , the detector operating temperature is 193 k. the primary coil of the pulse transformer ( pulse electronics ) is connected between the system ground and the cathode of the nfad .",
    "the secondary coil of the transformer couples to a 50 @xmath5 transmission line ( tl ) .",
    "a bypass resistor of 10 m@xmath5 and a schottky diode serve to protect the nfad from unexpected voltage surges or spikes .",
    "the rest of the readout electronics , including high voltage modules and the wide band rf amplifier , are in a nuclear instrumentation module ( nim ) at room temperature .",
    "the high voltage control module ( matsusada ) supplies variable bias voltage to the nfad , and its output value is controlled by a multi - turn linear potentiometer .",
    "the bias voltage spans from 0 to 80 v. two wide band rf amplifiers ( mini - circuits ) have 40 db gain in total to amplify the signals from the pulse transformer via the tl .",
    "the experimental setup to characterize the nfads is based on time - correlated single photon counting ( tcspc ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . optical pulses are generated with an id-301 1550 nm distributed feedback ( dfb ) laser , attenuated by an exfo programable attenuator ( fva-3100 ) .",
    "the laser is triggered by a two - channel function generator ( tektronix afg3502 ) .",
    "the attenuated weak coherent pulses pass through the attenuator and are sent to the nfad .",
    "the time tag unit records detections and the synchronization signals , and establishes their coincidences .",
    "the photon detection response is measured by a fast digital oscilloscope .",
    "[ fig : spice_model_sim ] ( a ) shows a typical waveform from an experimental measurement of the single photon response .",
    "we also simulated the response using a spice model for the equivalent circuit depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spice_model_sim ] ( b ) and the nfad model based on the results of hayat et al . @xcite .",
    "the simulation allows us to estimate the heating induced by each photon detection event , as well as the amount of avalanche charges coupled to the external readout circuit .",
    "both estimations can be achieved by simulating transient response simulation of a single avalanche event .",
    "the simulation results for the signal response of two readout methods are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : spice_model_sim ] : ( c ) shows the transient response based on our readout circuit design ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spice_model_sim ] ( b ) ) ; graph ( d ) is the result for the conventional readout method shown in ref . .",
    "the conventional circuits transient response has a persistent current plateau ranging from @xmath010 - 100 ns and is proportional to the overbias voltage @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "our main response voltage peak is less than 5 ns , and is independent of overbias voltage .",
    "the slow variations of the persistent current induce almost no voltage via the transformer to the amplifier input .",
    "the simulation and experiment results agree well for the leading period of about 5 ns long .",
    "the experimental data exhibit a more complicated response , because the current spice model only accounts for the main physical process .    in order to study the power consumption arising from the joule heating effect , we performed numerical integration over the product of total power supply current and voltage .",
    "two sources of heat generation are identified : a constant background heat power of @xmath7 induced by bias and protection circuitry ( e.g. @xmath8 resistor @xmath9 ) , and an additional @xmath10 produced by every detection .",
    "therefore , even at very high detection rates , the heating caused by detections is negligible , compared to other sources of heat , such as the background heat .",
    "moreover , it is of interest to analyze the net avalanche charge , @xmath11 , coupled to the external amplifier .",
    "we performed the numerical integration over the simulated voltage across a 50  @xmath5 load via @xmath12 .",
    "the computed result showed the avalanche charge with inductive coupling is about @xmath13 c ( corresponding to @xmath14 electron charge  @xmath15 ) . comparing this to the net avalanche charge for a conventional readout circuit @xcite , ours consumes at least two orders of magnitude less avalanche charges to produce a legitimate photon response pulse .",
    "this low coupling charge leads to the improved sensitivity of our readout circuit , and contributes to the low afterpulsing dark noise performance of the detector system .",
    "we first use attenuated coherent states , prepared at regular repetition rate , to characterize the detection efficiency of the nfad .",
    "we choose the period of the repetitive pulse ( @xmath16s ) to be much longer than the detector recovery time ( @xmath17 ns ) .",
    "the coherent state of each pulse is represented in the fock basis by @xmath18 , where the average photon number contained in each pulse is @xmath19 .",
    "since detection events are identified by comparing the voltage level of an photon response pulse to a pre - setting threshold , we model this type of detector as a so - called bucket detector @xcite . the probability for click and no - click of the bucket detector",
    "are described by @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .    in the experiment",
    ", we measure the ratio of detected photon click events , @xmath22 , within the 1  ns correlated time window , @xmath23 , versus the photon trigger repetition rate , @xmath24 , under a certain average photon number per pulse , @xmath6 .",
    "we combine the coherent quantum states to derive the detection efficiency , @xmath25 with the tcspc method as : @xmath26 where the total non - photon detection events , @xmath27 , becomes a summation of pure dark counts , @xmath28 , and afterpulsing events induced by photon detections , @xmath29 , i.e. @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31 is the smallest time window in the tcspc counting system .",
    "here we always use a 1  ns time window for all measurements with the time tag unit .    because the darkcount and repetition rates are both below 10  khz , and @xmath32 s , we are able to use @xmath33 as a very good approximation in most of our de measurements .",
    "thus , we have a practical relation to compute the de : @xmath34 here we assume the detector operator is known to behave as a bucket detector .",
    "if one wants to characterize a completely unknown detector , then a more general approach would be to perform the detector tomography@xcite .",
    "prior to the detection efficiency ( de ) measurements , we first measure the darkcount rate for various bias voltages .",
    "both detectors exhibit a similar behavior of voltage to darkcount rate .",
    "[ fig : dark - voltage ] shows the trend of darkcount rate as a function of input voltage . over",
    "the range of overbias voltages tested , the darkcount rate varies from 0.1 to 10,000 cps .",
    "the photon event , detected by the nfad , is registered by a time tag unit whose time resolution is 156 ps .",
    "the time window width was set to be 1  ns for all of our measurements , unless explicitly mentioned .",
    "each measurement was carried out for a second and repeated 10 times .",
    "[ fig : dark - dqe ] shows the de measurement results using eq .",
    "[ eq : eta_approx ] . the experimental de exhibits a saturation at darkcount rate above 10  khz .",
    "the maximum detection efficiency for the nfads is @xmath35 , and , with reasonable darkcount rates , it can reach @xmath36 .",
    "note that this detector efficiency is at the system level ; no normalization was used to take into account the device active area , nor the insertion loss of the coupling path . in the de test for both nfads",
    ", we also vary the discriminator voltage levels .",
    "no significant de improvements can be found by choosing different threshold values .",
    "we verify that the detectors act as bucket detectors .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct , then the detector click probability ( the ratio of the detection event counts within the correlation time window to that of the total pulsed photon rate ) is expected to behave as @xmath37 .",
    "the experimental results are compared with theoretical curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : dqe - photonnum ] .",
    "the curve is computed with the best fitting value of de , @xmath38 .",
    "the measurement results for two different nfads are obtained at the darkcount rate approximately at 100  cps .",
    "the other testing conditions are kept the same the de measurement , except for the photon triggering rate , which is increased to 10  khz . the good agreement for both detectors",
    "indicate that the bucket detector model is valid for our nfads .",
    "this description is thus appropriate for modeling further quantum optics measurements .",
    "a key benefit of our unique readout circuit is that we operate the nfad at lower temperature than most ingaas spads are operated at ( typically around 233  k ) .",
    "[ fig : dqe - temp ] shows the effect of temperature on the relation between de and dcr .",
    "once the de and its associated darkcount rate are measured , we can find the detector noise equivalent power ( nep ) via @xmath39 .",
    "the best noise equivalent power is estimated to be @xmath40 for detector  1 ; and @xmath41 for detector  2 at 193 k. we will also study the figure of merit , which depends on the detector jitter time , in section [ sec : jitter ] .      the unique property of spdc photon pairs has been exploited to characterize single photon detectors",
    "ever since the seminal work by burnham _ _ et al.__@xcite , other researchers have published their approaches @xcite to reduce the uncertainties in determining the absolute detector efficiencies .",
    "the experimental accuracy is limited by a wide varieties of nonideal factors @xcite . the typical experimental configuration for characterizing a spdc source operated with a continuous - wave ( cw ) laser , uses two free running single photon detectors , and time correlation photon counting logics .",
    "note that the production times of photon pairs are random in this case .",
    "an alternative configuration @xcite , which is widely used particularly when the down converted photon pairs in the 1550 nm wavelength range , can be the use of of one free running detector , in combination with a gated spad , which typically has a higher efficiency .    in our experiment , we tested two combinations of detectors , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : spdc_testing_scheme ] .",
    "the spdc source is an integrated waveguide based on a periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) substrate @xcite .",
    "[ fig : spdc_testing_scheme ]  ( a ) illustrates the first setup , which is comprised of two free running nfads , with their detection events recorded by a time tag unit .",
    "both free - running nfads have the figure of merit @xmath42 at @xmath43 nm , as defined in ref . .",
    "[ fig : spdc_testing_scheme ] ( b ) shows the commonly used configuration : a free running nfad is employed to trigger the second gated id-201 uln spd module .",
    "its settings are : detection efficiency is @xmath44 , deadtime is 40 @xmath6s , and gate width is 2.5 ns .",
    "the spdc in ppln is set to be in the non - degenerated mode , where the two down converted photons have different wavelength of ( 1570 @xmath45 12.5 ) nm and ( 1530 @xmath45 12.5 ) nm , respectively .",
    "the photons are separated by a dichroic mirror and fed into two detectors connected to channels 1 and 2 .",
    "the overall procedure is based on two successive measurements depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spdc_testing_scheme ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "for the two free running detector scheme , we keep nfad 1 at @xmath46 counts per second on average . to achieve this condition",
    ", we maintain a constant bias voltage to nfad 1 and a constant pumping power to the ppln .",
    "we vary the bias voltage to the second detector nfad 2 . at each voltage step",
    ", we record the total single counts , as well as coincidental counts using the time tag unit .",
    "the net count ( total single rate minus darkcount rate ) of the down converted photons in channel one ( ch-1 ) and channel two ( ch-2 ) are given by @xmath47 , @xmath48 ; their coincidental counts @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is number of photon pairs , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the efficiencies of the two channels , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the detection efficiencies of the two detectors ; @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the afterpulsing coefficients of nfad  1 and nfad  2 , which will be addressed in the following section .",
    "therefore , from the scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig : spdc_testing_scheme ]  ( a ) , we can find the ratio @xmath58 using two nfads ; subsequently , if we switch to the scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig : spdc_testing_scheme ]  ( b ) , we can find another ratio @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , we can infer the efficiency of nfad 2 via @xmath60 . in practice , the afterpulsing coefficient is hard to maintain constant when the darkcount rate is high",
    ". additionally , the accuracy of this detector efficiency measurement is also limited by wide varieties of other nonideal factors @xcite .    fig .",
    "[ fig : spdc_de_measurements ]  ( a ) displays the inferred detection efficiencies @xmath61 of nfad  2 , and the results are compared with the aforementioned wcp method .",
    "the two plots are at the same bias voltage and discriminator threshold settings .",
    "the calculation of @xmath61 is based on the assumption that the channel  2 efficiency @xmath53 , and nfad  1 afterpulsing coefficient @xmath56 , are both kept constant in two consecutive schemes .",
    "afterpulsing is the most significant side effect for ingaas spads ; it introduces extra counts , in addition to the intrinsic photon and noise counts of the detector .",
    "it is mostly owing to defects in the semiconductor materials form carrier traps which hold the avalanche charge carriers .",
    "the lifetime of the trapped charge carriers ranges from a few ns up to some tens of @xmath6s in conventional ingaas / inp spads working in the gated geiger mode @xcite .",
    "as the operating temperature is lowered , such as the case in this work , the afterpulsing problem becomes more prominent because the trapping is longer .",
    "the nfads afterpulsing measurements are performed with the same setup as for the de characterization ( see fig .",
    "first , we measure the photon response using a fast digital oscilloscope instead of the time tagger .",
    "the measured screen shot is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfad_voltage_transient ]  ( a ) .",
    "we also simulate the voltage across the intrinsic spad inside the nfad with the spice circuit model ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : spice_model_sim ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "the transient simulation results is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfad_voltage_transient ]  ( b ) , where the time constant is determined to be 1.1  @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "we use the time tagger to measure the detector recovery . to identify",
    "which event is the photon detection , we measure a synchronization signal from the function generator on ch-1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) as the time reference .",
    "this enables us to discriminate between photon detections and events caused by dark counts or afterpulsing .",
    "all of the afterpulsing measurements are taken with the nfad darkcount rate set to about 100  cps . because we only record time tags for detector click event where the amplitude is higher than a preset threshold voltage , the weak avalanche events for the first few tens of ns after a detection are not recorded .    fig . [",
    "fig : nfad_voltage_transient ] ( c ) illustrates this effect as an effective detector deadtime , following the rising voltage of nfad recovery process right after a photon detection event .",
    "depending on the operating temperature and the discriminator voltage settings , we observed that the nfad effective deadtime is at least 40 to 50 ns long ( dash line 1 ) .",
    "after the deadtime period , we find a rapid recovery of afterpulsing events , rising within a time of about 25 ns ( between dash line 1 and line 2 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfad_voltage_transient ] ( d ) , we quantitatively measure the lifetime of the trapped avalanche carriers using a standard exponential decay function @xcite , @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "@xmath66 , in our case , is the nfad effective deadtime resulting from the finite threshold of the time tag unit . theoretically , this value is around zero . with higher temperatures ,",
    "the effective deadtime is slightly shorter , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nfad_voltage_transient ] .",
    "@xmath67 is the characteristic detrapping time .",
    "our best fit value to this curve is @xmath68 1.1 @xmath6s at both 193  k and 203  k , while the prefactor @xmath69 is smaller at 203  k. if we compare @xmath67 with voltage recovery time constant , it turns out that they are almost identical , which implies that detrapping of the residual avalanche charge is mainly induced by the detector recovery voltage .",
    "[ fig : afp_vths ] ( a ) shows the afterpulsing behavior of our nfads for different discriminator voltages . we notice that increasing the threshold voltage can reduce the amount of afterpulsing for a short time after the detection , but the effect on the overall number of afterpulsing events is small .",
    "[ fig : afp_vths ] ( b ) illustrates the effect of operating temperature on afterpulsing probability .",
    "as expected , afterpulsing becomes more prominent at lower temperatures .",
    "however , it is important to note that the measurements are performed at constant darkcount levels , and therefore the detector efficiency is lower for the higher temperature settings .",
    "another interesting approach to model afterpulsing behavior of a nfad is by introducing afterpulsing coefficient defined as @xmath70 , where @xmath49 is the correlated count rate , @xmath71 is the total raw count rate , and @xmath28 is the darkcount rate at a given bias voltage .",
    "we vary the bias voltage to collect the raw counts and compute @xmath72 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : afterpulsingkappa ] ( a ) and ( b ) .    note that the coefficient @xmath72 is obtained via the wcp scheme . as we mentioned in the previous section , due to changes in experimental conditions",
    "including surround light sources , the observed darkcount rates in the spdc experiments were different than for the wcp scheme . to estimate @xmath72 using darkcount rate for the spdc scheme , one must take into account the joint detection efficiency .",
    "for quantum optics applications , the timing jitter of the detector , @xmath73 , is another key parameter .",
    "the jitter time of the detector results from the fluctuations of its response time .",
    "many mechanisms contribute to this variation .",
    "one source of jitter is the readout electronics .",
    "another is intrinsic to the detector , primarily due to the stochastic build - up time of avalanche carriers within the multiplication region @xcite when the spd detects a photon .    here , we measured the jitter time using a becker @xmath74 hickl spc-130 pci card .",
    "we change the gain of the time to amplitude converter ( tac ) to set the time resolution to 1.22 ps per division .",
    "this setting is used for all of the measurements .",
    "the other key technique for measuring high precision jitter time is to carefully adjust the zero crossing ( zc ) level of both inputs , usually set close the threshold levels .    .timing jitter measurement @xcite at 10 khz repetition rate of pulse laser , 0.1 photon and 1.0 photon on average per pulse .",
    "the measurements are accumulated for 1000 s. [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we took measurements for two different values of the average photon number per pulse .",
    "the low average photon number , 0.1 photon per pulse , effectively simulates the regime of single photon detection . at this level of @xmath6 ,",
    "the jitter time is mostly below 150 ps , which is compatible to the resolution of our time tag unit .",
    "this photon flux level simulates the case present in many quantum optics experiments , such as detecting photon pairs generated by nonlinear optical processes .",
    "we also set @xmath75 , not only a comparable photon flux to what is used for decoy state qkd protocol @xcite , but also to get an indication of the timing jitter intrinsic to the electronics . in all of the tests",
    ", we maintained the darkcount rate below 200  cps .",
    "the measurement settings and jitter measurement are also summarized in table [ table_1 ] . for @xmath75 ,",
    "the measured jitter is 31 ps .",
    "for @xmath76 , the timing jitter becomes wider also due to the width of laser pulse@xcite , which is specified to be @xmath4300  ps .",
    "most measured jitters are around 100 ps , depending on the setting of pc-130 card ranging , ranging from 59 ps to 154 ps .",
    "most importantly , all of the detection events fall within a 400 ps time length , regardless of measurement settings , which is a very good timing response .",
    "the typical response of spads , including silicon ones , is that their time distribution has a long tail on the order of a few ns ( see ref . ) even if their fhwm - jitter is a few tens of ps .",
    "table [ table_1 ] also suggests a trade off between the total counts and the combination of  low limit \" and  zc level \" settings , by which we can collect higher total counts , but at the cost of longer jitter time .",
    "however , no long recovery tail is found in all of our jitter measurements .",
    "lastly , based on these jitter measurements , the detector figure of merit@xcite can be calculated from the expression @xmath77 .",
    "our observations show that the best figure of merit is @xmath78 for detector 1 .",
    "entanglement - based qkd can achieve the longest distance when the photon pair source is symmetrically put in the middle of two parties alice and bob @xcite .",
    "@xcite first showed this configuration can tolerate up to 70  db channel loss .",

    "we experimentally simulated secret key rates for two types of telecom optical fibers : a standard telecom fiber ( smf-28 ) whose loss , @xmath103 , is 0.2 db per km , and an ultra low loss ( ull ) telecom fiber ( smf-28-ull ) @xcite , whose loss is 0.164 db per km .",
    "note that in both cases , we have introduced 6 db extra loss , to account for optical losses including interconnections at alice , bob and central source sites .",
    "the results are showed in fig . [",
    "fig : hilossqkd_distance ] .",
    "the discrete dots in the figure are based on the experimental data for three levels of optical attenuations .",
    "the results suggest that the distance of entangled pair based qkd is feasible over 300 km via the standard telecom fiber , and can reach over 400 km in telecom ull fiber .",
    "one caveat is that the finite key size effect has not been taken into account for both simulations .",
    "nonetheless , given the time resolution of our detector and the possibility to achieve an entanglement photon source whose rate can reach up to a few hundreds of mhz , entanglement - based qkd system over 400 km is possible .",
    "another remarkable observation is that normally a detector free of afterpulsing ( @xmath104 ) will have its cut - off qkd distance limit proportional to the photon pair rate .",
    "this is not the case for the current nfad design , because our detector is free running and no extra afterpulse suppressing circuit has been introduced , leading to its afterpulsing coefficient of @xmath105 . with this nonzero value ,",
    "the qkd cut - off distance is no longer proportional to @xmath51 .",
    "instead the secret key rate vanishes when @xmath106 mhz approximately .",
    "however , one remedy to this situation is to decrease the current detector efficiency to @xmath107 and @xmath108 , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the afterpulsing parameter drops to less than one .",
    "consequently , in the case of @xmath109 , the secret key rate does exist even when @xmath110 100 mhz .",
    "however , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hilossqkd_distance ] , its secret key rate is lower than the case when @xmath110 20 mhz , and the efficiency of both detectors are twice as high with @xmath105 . nevertheless , the regime where @xmath109 will be beneficial for studying novel high rate spdc entanglement photon pair source .",
    "we have reported a novel design to read out single photon responses for nfad operating at low temperatures .",
    "the system circuit diagram has been presented in detail .",
    "we carried out a spice model simulation to compare the conventional readout method with our approach .",
    "the simulation result agrees with the experimental measurement .",
    "detection efficiencies of both nfads are characterized using tcspc measurements under different temperatures and threshold settings via wcp source .",
    "subsequently , we have used two free running nfads and compared them with an id-201 detector .",
    "the inferred de of nfad  ii is derived from coincidence counts of the id-201 matches the expected nfad efficiencies obtained in wcp characterization . by scanning the average photon number in wcp",
    ", we confirmed that the nfad acts as a bucket detector @xcite in the quantum optics model .",
    "we also found that the detection repetition rate can be close to 100 khz without de degradation .",
    "the afterpulsing was tested by varying the threshold settings and ambient temperatures .",
    "the temporal distribution of afterpulsing events follows an exponentially decaying trend .",
    "our measurement of the nfad jitter time can achieve a fwhm of 31 ps .",
    "the dark noise below the rate of @xmath111 for the best nep @xmath112 .",
    "the figure of merit for spds was determined to reach @xmath113 .",
    "we also demonstrated that an entanglement - based qkd system can tolerate higher losses up to 70 db , which infers successful key distribution distance over 400 km of ull telecom optical fiber .",
    "we like to stress that the operating temperature for nfad is maintained in continuously cryogenic free mode with a simple electronic circuitry .",
    "no cryogenic facility is involved ; no vacuum is needed .",
    "the cooling power of our system ( @xmath114 allows it to be an readily expandable platform to include higher numbers of nfads , where the heat emitted from each detector is less than 1 mw , even for count rates of about 1  mhz detection pulse rate per detector .",
    "these advantages enable this nfad system to be a good candidate in quantum optics , quantum cryptography , and spdc entanglement source characterization applications for the telecom band .",
