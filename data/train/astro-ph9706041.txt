    "the existence of an intrinsic spread or dispersion in the galaxy cluster x - ray luminosity - temperature ( l - t ) relationship has been noted by several authors ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite etc . ) .",
    "fabian et al . ( 1994 ) demonstrated a correlation between the amplitude of the l - t relationship and the cooling flow mass deposition rate @xmath1(@xmath2yr@xmath3 ) ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "recently mushotzky & scharf ( 1997 ) have shown that the intrinsic dispersion of the l - t relationship does not seem to evolve and remains constant over a wide range in redshift ( @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) . since the advent of high precision cluster metallicity measurements ( yamashita et al 1992 ) it is also clear that there is a dispersion of a factor of 2 in cluster fe metallicities .",
    "this variation also does not evolve with redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "as fabian et al ( 1994 ) have pointed out , it is likely that temperatures , iron abundances and cooling flows are all linked consequences of cluster histories .    in this paper",
    "we show that the variance in the l - t relationship and the cluster metallicity are correlated and can be explained in a simple model of hierarchical clustering if the dispersion in the present l - t relation reflects the _ range _ of cluster formation epochs .",
    "we propose that the range in cluster formation epochs can simultaneously help explain the correlation between the position of a cluster in the l - t relationship , its metallicity , and the correlations with cooling flow rates .",
    "using a large sample ( 102 total , 39 in the luminosity range @xmath7erg s@xmath8 ) of clusters we have previously demonstrated ( @xcite ) that both the mean cluster temperature and intrinsic temperature dispersion ( at a fixed bolometric luminosity ) of the cluster population remains constant over the redshift range @xmath9 . using likelihood analysis",
    "we have estimated the intrinsic dispersion in the l - t relationship as @xmath10 kev at 7 kev , modeling the dispersion as a gaussian .",
    "we shall show that this intrinsic dispersion can be plausibly explained as being largely due to a range of formation epochs in the cluster population and thus the data can place some constraints on these epochs . semi - analytic models of the cluster population typically assume that the redshift of a cluster is approximately the redshift of its formation . in an @xmath11 universe dominated by cold dark",
    "matter this is a justifiable simplification .",
    "it is not clear however that it should apply to lower density cosmologies or to those with ( for example ) a mixture of hot and cold dark matter .",
    "we use the formalism of kityama & suto ( 1997 ) who modify the press - schecter theory to include the epoch of cluster formation as an explicit variable .",
    "kityama & suto suggest that the following is approximately true , assuming a self similar model where the cluster core radius is proportional to the virial radius ; @xmath12 @xmath13 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) and ( @xmath14 ) is the cluster formation epoch and @xmath15 is an effective index that is unity for @xmath11 and no cosmological constant and varies weakly with @xmath14 for low density cosmologies .",
    "a factor @xmath16 relates the observed cluster temperature at redshift @xmath17 to the virial temperature at @xmath18 .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations indicate that cluster temperatures are consistent with @xmath19 ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , at a given mass scale ( @xmath20 ) , clusters which formed at earlier epochs are expected to be hotter and more luminous , with luminosity increasing more rapidly than temperature .",
    "since the temperature evolution of clusters is seen to be zero or small ( @xcite ) we expect @xmath21 .",
    "preheating of the intracluster medium has been invoked ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) to reproduce the apparent _ negative _ evolution seen in the luminosity function of the most luminous clusters at high redshift ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and to better fit the locally observed l - t relation with semi - analytic models .",
    "the assumptions made in such models ( @xcite ) imply that the heated gas will contract until the gas temperature is roughly equal to the virial temperature of the dark halo .",
    "the gas density profile is then set by the cluster potential rather than the dark matter density contrast .",
    "the effect on equations 1 & 2 is that the overall @xmath18 dependence of the l - t relation is weakened and therefore , for our purposes , this self - similar case provides a lower limit in the determination of an effective @xmath18 .    using the measured temperature dispersion at a fixed luminosity ( @xmath22 kev at @xmath23 ) , and assuming a fixed mass scale",
    ", we can then proceed to calculate the effective era of cluster formation . combining equations 1 & 2 and assuming that the observed @xmath24 is due to the range of formation epochs ( from @xmath25 to @xmath26 ) we obtain ; @xmath27 , since @xmath21 .    for an @xmath28 @xmath29 universe ( @xmath30 ) in which the most recent cluster formation is at @xmath31",
    "then the earliest epoch of cluster formation would be at @xmath32 ( with some at higher z , since we model the l - t dispersion as a gaussian ) .",
    "since lower density cosmologies act to _ increase _ this upper bound we can make the general statement that , if clusters are still forming at @xmath31 , then they must have begun forming at @xmath33 .",
    "if the cluster population had essentially finished forming by @xmath34 then we would expect the earliest clusters to have formed at @xmath35 .",
    "given the lack of observed evolution in the population of galaxy clusters to at least @xmath36 ( e.g. @xcite ) this latter result may be a better fit to observations .",
    "we have used a sample of 32 clusters ( @xmath37 ) with precise fe abundance measurements ( averaged over the cluster ) , temperatures and bolometric luminosities ( @xcite , @xcite and additional unpublished results ) to determine if the fe abundance is correlated with the relative deviation of a cluster from the mean l - t relationship .    in figure 1",
    "we have plotted the observed fe abundance relative to solar ( @xcite ) as a function of the amplitude of the l - t loci , hereafter @xmath38 , assuming @xmath39 , which has been determined to be a good empirical fit ( @xcite ) as well as being close to theoretical expectations ( which range from @xmath40 to @xmath41 ) .",
    "the point size is proportional to the cluster temperature .",
    "the x - coordinate , @xmath38 , is therefore a direct measure of the ` sense ' of the dispersion from a single power law fit to the l - t relation .",
    "the larger @xmath38 is , the more luminous a cluster is for a given temperature .",
    "it is clear from figure 1 that a correlation exists between iron abundance and @xmath38 such that clusters with higher abundances are more luminous at fixed temperature .",
    "the sole exception to this is the centaurus cluster which is the second closest luminous cluster and is known to have a strong abundance gradient ( @xcite ) and might therefore be considered anomalous .",
    "a spearman rank - order correlation test on the data ( with the centaurus metallicity adjusted as indicated in figure 1 ) confirms that fe and @xmath38 are positively correlated with 98% confidence and @xmath42 .",
    "an unweighted least squares fit ( plotted in figure 1 ) yields : @xmath43 .",
    "a maximum likelihood analysis of the iron abundance residuals to this best fit allows us to constrain the intrinsic dispersion ( independent of @xmath38 ) in fe to be @xmath44 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "the cluster a2218 , with the lowest abundance in the sample , has been extensively studied ( e.g. @xcite ) and is generally thought to be in an unrelaxed dynamical state due to a recent large merger .",
    "there is no apparent correlation with cluster temperature in the fe-@xmath38 plane . in figure 2",
    "the same data are plotted , but with point size proportional to redshift , no redshift correlation is seen in the fe-@xmath38 plane .",
    "from equations 1 & 2 the quantity @xmath38 should increase with earlier cluster formation epoch and thus we are led to interpret the data in figure 1 to mean that higher abundance clusters formed earlier .",
    "this has profound implications for the nature of their formation .",
    "the metallicities observed in clusters are thought to have originated primarily from sne type ii in an early epoch of star formation ( @xcite ) . in this interpretation",
    "the intracluster medium will have undergone a significant pre - heating at @xmath45 due to the energetics required to match the observed abundances .",
    "pre - heating is also favoured by recent measurements of negligible , or slightly negative , cluster luminosity evolution to @xmath46 ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and by measurements of negligible temperature evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "recent semi - analytical models of galaxy formation ( @xcite ) indicate that 80% of the intracluster metals were produced at @xmath45 .",
    "the sense of the relationship between @xmath38 and abundance to @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of a hierarchical ` tree ' history .",
    "in such a theory there are two extremes .",
    "either clusters have started as a single , dominant potential well , into which much smaller clumps have fallen , or clusters have formed by the merger of intermediate sized clumps over their history .",
    "these two routes to a final cluster are , in fact , seen explicitly in halo merger studies ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we note that , for either case , the rate of growth of the progenitor mass is generally slower for low density cosmologies ( @xcite ) .    in the pre - heating scenario",
    "it is expected that low mass sub - clumps will , because of their smaller potential wells , lose a substantial fraction of their heated enriched gas during the epoch of metal formation while massive systems will not .",
    "thus a cluster formed later , whose evolution is dominated by the merging of smaller sub - clumps , will tend to have a lower metal abundance and a lower value of @xmath38 than a massive system formed earlier by the collapse of a single large overdensity .",
    "this explanation does however assume that clusters formed through these two routes have roughly the same final virial mass .",
    "in hierarchical models the most massive systems are expected to form last so clearly this ` direct ' interpretation of the l - t dispersion is a likely oversimplification of the real play - off between system mass and @xmath14 in equations 1 & 2 .",
    "observational evidence ( e.g. @xcite ) indicates that ( where discernable ) the subclumps involved in the formation of luminous clusters at low redshift are themselves typically low luminosity systems , such as groups .",
    "the abundances measured in groups are indeed often low ( @xcite ) , consistent with our hypothesis .",
    "our interpretation of the correlation in figure 1 is also consistent with the results of fabian et al ( 1994 ) which demonstrated that higher @xmath1 clusters have larger @xmath38 and that higher @xmath1 clusters typically have higher abundances .",
    "cooling flows are expected to be disrupted by major mergers and hence objects which have not experienced mergers are relatively undisturbed and , in the language used above , are ` truly ' old .",
    "they would then also be expected to have higher @xmath47 s .",
    "one of the ` oldest ' objects in our sample would then be 2a0335 + 096 ( figures 1 & 2 ) .",
    "there is evidence ( @xcite ) that this cluster is indeed at a late stage of cooling , which places its age at @xmath48gyr ( @xcite , and @xcite ) , or a @xmath14 of @xmath49 , consistent with the results in section 2 .",
    "it is important to note that the definitions of formation epochs ( in terms of mass halos ) are actually somewhat arbitrary , for example lacey & cole ( 1993 ) propose a criteria that @xmath18 is the epoch at which a halo of mass @xmath20 at @xmath17 had a mass greater than @xmath50 for the first time .",
    "thus , the above scenario is certainly overly simplistic and it is probably better to consider cluster formation as a continuous process which , however , for illustrative purposes can be subdivided into general classes such as the two ( realistic ) extremes described above .    clearly , the range of abundances combined with the l - t dispersion results shown above , should allow , through careful modeling , new constraints to be placed on the overall pathways of hierarchical cluster formation .",
    "we propose that the observed dispersion in the cluster l - t relationship reflects the range in cluster formation epochs within a hierarchical universe .",
    "the relationship of cooling flow mass deposition with luminosity and temperature is then qualitatively explained if we assume that cooling flow clusters are both initially denser and older than non - cooling flow clusters , which we associate with recent major mergers .",
    "the observed dispersion in cluster iron abundances and its correlation with position in the l - t diagram ( @xmath38 ) is accounted for ( except for a possible residual intrinsic dispersion of @xmath51 ) if the smaller mass units that are involved in the mergers can lose metals via an early cluster wind phase and then merge to form the lower @xmath38 systems . in this scenario",
    "we can constrain the earliest cluster formation to be at @xmath52 . while there are clearly other candidate mechanisms for producing the observed variances in abundances and temperatures ( e.g. inhomogeneity of the intracluster medium ( @xcite ) , these must ultimately also be functions of the cluster age and history .    larger data sets and more detailed cosmological simulations",
    "will greatly improve our understanding of the results presented here and will test our hypothesis that the measurement of a clusters iron abundance informs us of its age and formation history . for example , we expect that higher abundance clusters will typically have higher baryonic fractions .",
    "we also expect that the most massive clusters observed at @xmath53 will typically have higher abundances than their local counterparts . in future work",
    "we will investigate these predictions .",
