    "[ lfcomp ] , we devised a ratio of the number of stars in a magnitude range on the rgb to the number near the cluster turnoff .",
    "this selection is based on the finding of @xcite that cluster luminosity functions very nearly overlie one another ( independent of [ fe / h ] , [ @xmath77/fe ] , age , and initial mass function ; see also @xcite ) when they are shifted so that the turnoffs are coincident in magnitude . by defining samples of cluster stars relative to easily - measured points on the cluster s fiducial line and taking the ratio of samples",
    ", we can nearly eliminate uncertainties resulting from imperfectly known cluster parameters and from the shifting and normalization of the theoretical luminosity functions .",
    "in addition , statistical errors are easy to determine using poisson statistics .",
    "we define the magnitude range of the rgb sample ( @xmath78 ) relative to the turnoff magnitude @xmath79 ( @xmath80 for m10 ) .",
    "the turnoff sample @xmath81 is selected from the stars in a 0.4-magnitude wide bin centered on @xmath82 . because our final luminosity function employs corrections for field contamination and incompleteness , we computed the ratio from the lf . for the count excess in @xmath74",
    ", we find a ratio @xmath83 , and for the excess with @xmath75 , @xmath84 .",
    "the major source of systematic uncertainty is the measurement of @xmath79 ; if it shifts with respect to the rgb magnitude range being used , the ratio value changes substantially . if @xmath85 , the two ratios become 0.130 and 0.0397 , and they become 0.103 and 0.0312 if @xmath86 . using theoretical models ,",
    "we can compute expected values for the ratios . from the yonsei - yale isochrones @xcite , we find ratios of 0.0694 and 0.0227 for [ fe / h]@xmath87 , [ @xmath77/fe ] = 0.3 , age 12 gyr , and mass function exponent @xmath88 . because our reference population is at the turnoff and not fainter , the ratios are insensitive to large changes in the mass function exponent .",

    "thus , no reasonable variation of parameters like age or [ fe / h ] or possible errors in the determination of @xmath82 is able to account for the excess of rgb stars in the observed lf of m10 . comparing our best observational value and the best theoretical model ,",
    "the differences are significant at more than the @xmath92 and @xmath93 levels for the samples fainter than ( @xmath74 ) and brighter than ( @xmath75 ) the rgb bump .",
    "in addition to comparing the lf to theoretical models , it is also valuable to compare to other globular clusters .",
    "the cluster m12 provides an excellent comparison . using relative age indicators",
    ", we find that the ages of m10 and m12 are consistent to within measurement errors . the color differences between the turnoff and red giant branch ( see fig .",
    "[ fidcomp ] ) and the magnitude differences between turnoff and horizontal branch ( @xmath94 for m12 ) are both close for the two clusters .",
    "the metallicities are also close : the zw values only differ by 0.01 dex , while @xcite measurements indicate a difference of 0.15 dex or less with m12 the more metal - rich ( consistent with its redder upper rgb ) .",
    "the distances of the two clusters are also the same to within the measurement errors .",
    "one notable difference between the clusters is the main sequence mass function exponent @xmath95 : @xcite found @xmath96 for m12 , while we find @xmath72 for m10 in this study .",
    "the differences in mass function mean that the two lfs can not be compared simply by correcting for differences in distance modulus and normalizing them using main sequence stars .",
    "when the star counts for the two clusters are normalized near the turnoff , there are more m10 stars than m12 stars in the magnitude ranges discussed above .",
    "we can quantify this using the same rgb - ms ratio for the cluster m12 using data from hargis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) since the `` best '' model parameters are nearly identical between the two clusters .",
    "hargis et al . found that the m12 lf showed no excess of rgb stars compared to theory when the lf is normalized to the main sequence .",
    "so , as expected we find @xmath97 for the faint sample in m12 ( @xmath98 ) as compared to 0.0755 from y@xmath99 models ( for [ fe / h ] = -1.41 , age 12 gyr , and mass function exponent @xmath100 ) and @xmath101 for m10 .",
    "for the brighter sample ( @xmath102 ) , the ratio is @xmath103 for m12 , compared to 0.025 from y@xmath99 models and 0.0354 for m10 .",
    "so , the population ratio values for m12 agree with theoretical predictions to less than 1 and @xmath104 , while the corresponding ratios for m10 differ by more than 7 and @xmath105 , respectively . thus , m10 has an excess of rgb stars relative to ms stars when compared to another well - studied , nearly - identical cluster .",
    "both the comparison between m10 and theoretical predictions and between m10 and the nearly identical cluster m12 indicate that the lf of m10 is anomalous .",
    "the rgb - ms ratio defined above is insensitive to the parameters age and heavy element content ( [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath77/fe ] particularly ) , which allows us to eliminate them from consideration as the cause .",
    "in addition to having an age and heavy element content that is identical to that of m10 to within current observational errors , m12 has a cmd morphology ( most notably a blue horizontal branch tail ) that is very nearly the same as m10 .",
    "whatever the cause of m10 s unusual lf , it does not seem to create noticeable differences in the evolutionary tracks of stars in the cmd except possibly near the rgb tip ( see fig .",
    "[ fidcomp ] ) .",
    "field - star contamination ( or errors involved in correcting for this contamination ) are unlikely to explain the unusual features of the lf .",
    "field stars are easily visible in the cmd brighter than the subgiant branch , and can also be detected fainter than the turnoff based on their colors ( significantly redder than the cluster fiducial , even when the data is dereddened ) and based on their lack of any concentration toward the cluster center ( see fig .",
    "[ cmds ] ) .",
    "once corrected , the lf of the main sequence , subgiant branch , and part of the lower red giant branch agrees very well with theoretical predictions ( see fig .",
    "[ fieldcorr ] ) . however , field star contamination is not strong enough to explain the lf excess just below the rgb bump , and contamination is negligible above the bump since the field star distribution clearly diverges from the rgb for @xmath106 .",
    "in addition , because the excess star counts are measured in both the core _ and _ envelope of the cluster , we can rule out most other sorts of foreground or background contamination .",
    "it is natural to expect that unusual features in lfs should result from physics that affects the evolutionary timescales of the stars .",
    "if that is the case here , we should look at factors that affect the rate at which nuclear fuel is processed .",
    "the abundance of helium and cno elements enter into the determination of the instantaneous nuclear reaction rate at any point in a star , yet theoretical models indicate that the abundance of cno elements does _ not _ significantly affect the relative numbers of rgb and ms stars while helium abundance plays a more substantial role @xcite .",
    "the reason for this can be seen in the study of @xcite  the evolutionary timescale for red giants is _ not _ changed by variations in helium abundance , but the ms timescale is .",
    "we believe that this can be understood qualitatively as being due to the nature of the structure of red giants : the rate of nuclear reactions in the hydrogen fusion shell is set entirely by the star s need to support the envelope and the position of the shell source ( set by the size of the degenerate core ) .",
    "the structural constraints on giant stars are responsible for the luminosity  core mass relations found in theoretical models of giant stars . when put in this framework , the possible causes of the discrepancy seen in m10 are more easily seen .",
    "the evolutionary timescale for red giants can be modified ( independently of the ms ) if there is a change in the way the envelope of the giant is supported .",
    "an example of this is seen in the rotating models of @xcite in which angular momentum was assumed to be conserved in radiative shells and convection zones were assumed to rotate like solid bodies . in the red giant stage",
    ", the contraction of the core leads to rapid rotation that provides a modest amount of centrifugal support to the star s envelope .",
    "this relieves the fusion shell of some of the burden of supporting the envelope ( or in other words , the density of the fusion shell decreases somewhat , causing a decrease in the energy output of the shell ) .",
    "the degree of centrifugal support changes as the star evolves thanks to continued contraction of the core as additional mass is added by the fusion shell .",
    "indirect evidence for significant core rotation comes from cluster horizontal branch stars ( e.g. behr 2003 ) : rotational velocities for some of these stars can reach as high as 40 km s@xmath9 . although this is intriguing , we are far from completely understanding the angular momentum evolution of giant stars , and there is no reason to believe that m10 stars have unusually high rotation on average .",
    "in addition , the relatively good agreement of observations and theory on the lower red giant branch argues against a process that modifies the evolutionary timescales from the beginning of the red giant branch .    for related reasons",
    ", we predict that so - called _ `` deep mixing '' on the rgb should not have a significant long - term effect on the evolutionary timescales of giant stars _ unless the extra mixing is somehow related to an alternate means of envelope support .",
    "( `` deep mixing '' processes are known to produce o - na anticorrelations at the surfaces of bright giants in many clusters . )",
    "changes to the chemical makeup of the material being processed by the fusion shell causes the shell and envelope of the star to adjust on a timescale much shorter than the lifetime of the red giant phase .",
    "the best - known example of this is the red giant bump .",
    "when the fusion shell reaches what was the base of the envelope convection zone ( in which the gas has a higher hydrogen content ) , the star s evolution temporarily slows as it adjusts to the new fuel mix .",
    "however , the slope of the differential lf function after the bump is not significantly different from what it was before , which means that the evolutionary timescales of the rgb stars are once again enforced by the structure .",
    "so , while there could be modifications to the cluster lf if deep mixing begins at a position different than the red giant bump , extended periods of deep mixing would not change the evolutionary timescale once the star s envelope has adjusted .",
    "spectroscopic analysis of m10 giants @xcite add some credence to this idea since m10 giants on average have oxygen depletions between that of m3 ( a cluster that has a theoretically - predicted ratio of giants to main sequence stars @xcite ) and m13 .",
    "so unless the adjustment timescale for the stellar envelope ( approximately the kelvin - helmholtz timescale ) is several times longer than that predicted for rgb bump stars evolving via standard physics _ and _ the star s brightness varies by several magnitudes during this time , it would be difficult to explain m10 s lf in this way",
    ".    ratios of giants to main sequence stars are obviously a function of the evolutionary timescales of both main sequence stars and giants . for ms stars , differences in initial helium abundance cause related differences in evolutionary timescale for the simple reason that the amount of fuel changes ( although there are additional effects resulting from changes to the star s luminosity ) .",
    "we do not believe that differences in initial helium content are to blame because i ) a large positive enhancement would be necessary for m10 , bringing m10 s helium content close to the solar value and going against expected nucleosynthetic trends ( @xmath107 ) @xcite , ii ) evidence from the helium abundance indicator @xmath108 shows that the globular cluster system as a whole does not have an intrinsic spread in @xmath109 of greater than 0.019 @xcite , iii ) there is virtually no difference in the cmd morphologies of m10 and m12 , and iv ) a change in main sequence timescales alone would tend to make the rgb star counts higher than predicted at all luminosity levels .",
    "the overall insensitivity of the ratio @xmath110 to most parameters that vary from cluster to cluster makes m10 s lf difficult to understand .",
    "the theoretical results do help to emphasize that in spite of the substantial structural differences between ms and rgb stars , there is a very strong connection between their evolutionary timescales .",
    "however , we must also keep in mind that clusters are made of individual stars . from the time a star reaches the turnoff of a globular cluster",
    ", it can take approximately 2 gyr to reach the middle of the rgb @xcite .",
    "while the mass function of _ current _ main sequence stars can be estimated from the slope of the lf , the mass function of now - evolved stars can not  in fact , it may be different .",
    "typically , theoretical lfs assume that the slope of the initial mass function for stars in a cluster is a constant .",
    "if this is not the case , then @xmath110 could differ from its well - determined theoretical value .",
    "the question remains whether such a variation in the initial mass function could be due to a statistical fluctuation or whether it would have to result from a stronger trend in the mass function of cluster stars .",
    "for @xmath75 , 79 stars were identified while only about 51 were expected . for @xmath74 ,",
    "250 stars were identified , and 149 were expected theoretically .",
    "poisson fluctuations ( @xmath111 ) in `` normal '' samples of stars as a function of mass therefore seem unlikely to account for the m10 observations .",
    "all of the stars currently on the giant branch would have originated from just one lf bin at the turnoff approximately 2 gyr ago , but even poisson fluctuations in a sample that size ( @xmath112 stars ) are several times too small to explain the giant branch excesses we see .",
    "another possibility is that the mass function at the cluster turnoff about 2 gyr ago deviated more systematically from the power - law form assumed in models .",
    "although this hypothesis can not be tested directly , we can look for signs of significant variations in mass function slope on the current main sequence .",
    "we compared the bin - to - bin lf slopes with theoretical values using the best `` average '' mass function exponent @xmath113 . on the upper main sequence ,",
    "several bins near the turnoff deviate from the theoretical lf slopes by between 2 and @xmath114 , and one interval ( @xmath115 ) closer to our faint limit deviates by almost @xmath116 .    of the main sequence lfs for m10 , m22 , and m55 discussed by @xcite , m10 s lf was least consistent with having a constant mass function slope @xmath95 ( although there is significant uncertainty in the mass - luminosity relation for the low mass stars ) .",
    "we note once again that an examination of the lf @xcite indicates that there is a noticeable drop in the main sequence luminosity function for @xmath117 ( it is less obvious in @xmath0 ) , so that it is not unreasonable to believe that there might have been another mass function variation among stars that have now left the main sequence .",
    "the anomaly seen in our lf of the evolved stars of m10 implies that there may have been a greater number of ms stars than expected from the @xmath72 mass function derived from the upper main sequence lf .",
    "a simple understanding of dynamical processes ( like evaporation ) would lead us to expect that strong dynamical effects would tend to remove low mass stars from a cluster , making the mass function shallower . because the main sequence lf observed by @xcite is much steeper than those of m22 and m55 ( but comparable to the metal - poorer clusters m15 , m30 , and m92 ) , the implication is that m10 has been affected in a comparatively minor way . even if dynamics are responsible for modifying m10 s lf , we are again left to explain why m12 does not show a similar effect , given that the characteristics of its galactic orbit are similar to that of m10 @xcite .    in the end , we do not have a satisfying explanation for the unusual aspects of m10 s lf , but the cause can be external to the stars themselves . though there is evidence for mass function variations ( changes in mass function slope ) from other parts of m10 s lf , we still have no explanation for why they might be present in a massive cluster like m10 .",
    "although the hypothesis is difficult to test , there are two possible avenues to follow .",
    "first , continued searches for unusual rgb luminosity functions in other globular clusters may turn up additional examples that would help to identify a relationship to cluster parameters ( although the most obvious correlations with metallicity or horizontal branch morphology seem to be ruled out by previously published lfs ) or identify whether rgb anomalies cover similar or different ranges of luminosity .",
    "second , main sequence luminosity functions using larger samples would help answer the question of whether significant ( non - poissonian ) lf fluctuations exist within clusters .",
    "most deep ms lfs have been derived using the wfpc2 imager on the _ hubble space telescope_. wide - field high spatial - resolution instruments ( like the advanced camera for surveys on hst or cameras on the cfht ) would be ideal for surveying the larger areas necessary .    we would like to thank j. hesser for his role in getting the cfht observations , and the anonymous referee for comments that have strengthened the manuscript .",
    "e.l.s . would like to thank j. faulkner for ( long - ago ) conversations about red giants , and r. rood for pointing out the potential role of lf fluctuations .",
