    "two - level systems are ubiquitous in various fields of physics .",
    "a large number of quantum phenomena rely on the existence of two quantum states , or their underlying principles can be understood using the simple model of a two - level system .",
    "recently , two - level systems have gained renewed attention as they represent the building blocks for quantum information processing ( qip ) applications @xcite .    in the study of two - level systems , as well as many other quantum systems , avoided level crossings are associated with a wide variety of interesting phenomena .",
    "large amounts of literature have been devoted to analyzing the dynamics of a two - level system driven around an avoided crossing , particularly in connection with landau - zener ( lz ) physics @xcite .",
    "these avoided crossing regions have a special significance in qip applications because coherence times are usually longest in those regions , hence the term optimal point .",
    "needless to say , nontrivial evolution of quantum systems is usually associated with some kind of energy - level crossing .    in this paper we discuss the dynamics of a two - level system driven by strong ac fields in the vicinity of an avoided crossing . as mentioned above ,",
    "numerous studies have been devoted to this problem , approaching it from different angles and applying it to different physical systems . here",
    "we present a geometric picture that leads to a simple understanding of the behaviour of the system .",
    "this approach can also be used to derive quantitative results in regions where other methods fail .",
    "we also keep in mind the idea of trying to find useful applications for strong driving as a tool to manipulate two - level systems , or as they are referred to in the context of qip , qubits ( in this context , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "a good example displaying the richness of strongly driven two - level systems is the so - called coherent destruction of tunnelling ( cdt ) @xcite .",
    "a particle in a symmetric double - well potential will generally oscillate back and forth between the two wells .",
    "if we now add an oscillating energy difference between the two wells , the frequency of the tunnelling oscillations changes . at certain combinations of the driving parameters , the tunnelling oscillations are frozen .",
    "this phenomenon has been analyzed from several different perspectives @xcite .",
    "we shall show below that it can be understood rather easily using our approach .    here",
    "we consider the situation where we start with an undriven system at an arbitrary bias point .",
    "we then analyze the dynamics that results from the application of strong driving fields .",
    "as one would expect , resonance peaks occur at properly chosen values of the parameters .",
    "we analyze the resonance conditions using two approaches : one employing a rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) and one employing an approximation of discretized evolution characterized by a sequence of fast lz crossings . between the two approaches , and the well - known weak - driving case ,",
    "most of the parameter space is covered .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model system , the hamiltonian that describes it and some preliminary arguments . in sec .",
    "iii we present a rwa that can be used to describe the dynamics in a certain region of the parameter space . in sec .",
    "iv we present a geometric picture that is useful to describe the dynamics in another region of the parameter space ( note that there is some overlap between the validity regions of secs .",
    "iii and iv ) .",
    "section v contains a discussion of the results and some concluding remarks .",
    "we consider a two - level system described by the hamiltonian : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ( time - independent ) coupling strength between the two basis states @xcite ; @xmath2 is the time - dependent bias point ; and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the usual @xmath5 and @xmath6 pauli matrices , respectively .",
    "note that we take @xmath7 throughout this paper . for definiteness and simplicity in the algebra ,",
    "we assume harmonic driving , i.e. we assume that @xmath2 can be expressed as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the dc component of the bias point ; and @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the amplitude , frequency and phase of the driving field .",
    "we shall , with no loss of generality , take all the parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and ( [ eq : drivingfield ] ) to be positive .",
    "in order to simplify the appearance of the expressions below , we shall take @xmath13 .",
    "this only simplifies the intermediate steps of the algebra , but it does not affect any of the main results . the energy - level diagram and the applied driving field",
    "are depicted in fig .  1 .    , in blue , of a two level system with minimum gap @xmath1 and ( b ) the time - periodic bias @xmath2 , in red .",
    "the vertical dashed line represents dc bias point @xmath9.,width=226 ]    we should mention here that recently this setup was studied experimentally using superconducting qubits in refs .",
    "@xcite , both of which contain theoretical analysis that overlaps with ours .",
    "related theoretical studies can also be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the absence of driving ,",
    "the behaviour of the system is simple . in the unbiased case ( i.e. , when @xmath14 ) , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 . as a result ,",
    "if the system is initially in one of these two states , it oscillates back and forth between them . in the strongly biased case ( i.e. , when @xmath17 ) , the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 are , to a good approximation , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "if the system is initially in one of them , it will only experience small oscillations , occupying the other state with a maximum probability @xmath18 .",
    "one could say that in this case the oscillations , which are driven by the @xmath3 term in the hamiltonian , are suppressed by the energy mismatch @xmath9 between the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 .    in the weak driving limit ( i.e. , when @xmath19 ) , rabi - oscillation physics applies .",
    "resonance occurs when @xmath20 , and the frequency of rabi oscillations is given by @xmath21 , where the angle @xmath22 is defined by the condition @xmath23 .",
    "rabi oscillations occur between the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( excluding the driving term ) , such that in the unbiased case the oscillations occur between the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "higher - order processes , with @xmath24 , can be described easily as well in this limit .",
    "we shall collectively refer to the weak - driving limit using the easily recognizable name of rabi - physics limit .",
    "since rabi physics is well known @xcite , we shall not discuss it in any detail here .",
    "instead , we focus on the case where the amplitude @xmath10 is comparable to or larger than @xmath25 . a suitable rwa can be used to obtain a good description of the dynamics when @xmath26 .",
    "this approach , described in sec .",
    "iii , can explain some interesting features of the problem , in particular the phenomenon of cdt mentioned in sec .",
    "i.    a different approximation can be used when @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( note that this condition overlaps with the validity condition of the rwa ) . in this case",
    "we can think of the dynamics as being composed of a sequence of lz crossings separated by periods of free evolution of the basis states .",
    "we shall take this approach to analyze the problem in sec iv .",
    "we shall then compare the validity conditions of the different approximations in sec .  v.",
    "we now take the system described by the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and make a transformation to a rotating frame , such that a wave function @xmath29 in the lab frame can be expressed as @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the wave function in the rotating frame . in other words",
    ", we use the interaction picture with the coupling term treated as a perturbation .",
    "the schrdinger equation @xmath33 can now be written as @xmath34 with @xmath35 we now make use of the relation @xmath36 where @xmath37 are bessel functions of the first kind , and we find that    @xmath38    note that in going from eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : hprime ] ) we have not made any approximations",
    ". it will be useful below to use the following asymptotic behaviour of the bessel functions : @xmath39 , \\hspace{0.5 cm } z \\gg n. \\label{eq : asymptotics}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we now perform a rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) : we assume that all the terms in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hprime ] ) oscillate very fast compared to the timescale of the ( coarse - grained , or smoothened ) system dynamics , with the exception of one term that is identified as the resonant or near - resonant term .",
    "the effect of the non - resonant terms can therefore be neglected when studying the long - time system dynamics .",
    "we should note here that this rwa is different from the one widely known and used in the case of weak driving . in that case",
    "the linear driving field is replaced by a rotating field , clockwise or counter - clockwise depending on conventions .",
    "the other component of the field , i.e. the one rotating in the opposite sense , is neglected @xcite .",
    "the resonance condition is identified using the intuitive requirement that the resonant term of the rwa is constant in time .",
    "we therefore have the resonance condition : @xmath40 for some integer @xmath41 . with parameters satisfying the resonance condition ,",
    "the @xmath42 oscillation frequency is given by : @xmath43 one usually identifies the resonance with a given value of @xmath41 as describing an @xmath44-photon process .",
    "the rabi resonance condition corresponds to the case @xmath45 , where we find that @xmath46 ( the difference from the condition @xmath20 will become clear shortly ) . assuming weak driving , we find that the frequency of rabi oscillations is given by : @xmath47 for large values of @xmath9 , the factor @xmath48 is a good approximation to the factor @xmath49 , where @xmath22 is the angle between the static bias field and the driving field .",
    "the rabi frequency vanishes asymptotically as @xmath50 , as it should .",
    "note also that @xmath51 ( eq . [ eq : rwaoscillationfrequency ] ) increases with increasing @xmath10 for small values of @xmath10 , but generally decreases as @xmath52 for large values of @xmath10 .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this latter behaviour will become clear in sec .",
    "iv . in particular , note that the turning point between the two behaviours ( or , alternatively , the maximum in @xmath51 ) occurs when @xmath10 is comparable to @xmath9",
    ".    the width of the resonance can be obtained from the following considerations . if the driving frequency is shifted from exact resonance ( eq .  [ eq : simplerc ] ) by @xmath53 , the resonant ( i.e. , slowest ) term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hprime ] ) oscillates with frequency @xmath54 .",
    "when these oscillations become faster than the @xmath42 oscillation dynamics , which is characterized by @xmath51 , the resonance is clearly lost .",
    "the width of the resonance can therefore be taken as : @xmath55 using higher - order processes ( i.e. , with @xmath56 ) therefore results in resonances that are narrow compared to the on - resonance oscillation frequency .",
    "this property can be useful , for example , in applications where one is dealing with several closely spaced resonances . if one is trying to drive only one of those resonances , this approach provides a possibility to target a single resonance , without necessarily making the oscillation dynamics extremely slow .",
    "we now note that for the above resonance condition ( eq .  [ eq : simplerc ] ) to hold we must be able to neglect all the oscillating terms .",
    "this means that we require that @xmath57 for all @xmath41 except the one satisfying the resonance condition @xcite . keeping in mind that @xmath58 for one value of @xmath41 , we find that the validity condition can be expressed simply as @xmath26 .",
    "this explains the difference between the above resonance condition and the usual resonance condition for rabi oscillations ; for example , when @xmath14 and @xmath59 we can not keep only one term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hprime ] ) , and this approximation breaks down . note , however , that even if @xmath14 we can still use this approximation , as long as @xmath26 .",
    "this approach is very useful when discussing the phenomenon of cdt , which we do next .",
    "the much - analyzed phenomenon of cdt @xcite can be explained using the above approach . in the unbiased case ( i.e. , when @xmath14 ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : simplerc ] ) gives the interesting result that , regardless of the value of @xmath11 , taking @xmath60 always satisfies the resonance condition .",
    "this means that oscillations between the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 will always occur with full @xmath42 conversion , provided of course that we can neglect all the terms with @xmath61 ( or in other words @xmath26 ) .",
    "this statement is obvious for no driving ( @xmath62 ) , but it is not obvious that for large driving fields ( @xmath63 ) full conversion should occur . from this point of view , it looks more surprising that full oscillations occur at all for strong driving , even though the system hardly spends any time in the degeneracy region @xcite . accepting the existence of these oscillations , we now take the oscillation frequency as given by eq .  ( [ eq : rwaoscillationfrequency ] ) with @xmath60 .",
    "it is now clear that cdt occurs when @xmath64 such that the resonant term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hprime ] ) has a vanishing coefficient ( note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : cdtcondition ] ) agrees with the results of previous work @xcite ) . with parameters satisfying the cdt condition ,",
    "the frequency of @xmath65 oscillations vanishes , and the oscillations are consequently suppressed .",
    "one could therefore say that cdt is simply the statement that the @xmath42 oscillation frequency becomes extremely small if we use driving parameters that are close to a point satisfying eq .",
    "( [ eq : cdtcondition ] ) .",
    "we now focus on the case of strong driving where the system repeatedly traverses the crossing region [ i.e. , @xmath27 ] . even in the case",
    "@xmath26 , where the treatment using the rwa above is still valid , that approach becomes less intuitive .",
    "instead , one can gain better insight into the problem by analyzing the dynamics as composed of discrete steps , as we shall do in this section ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "let us take the limit where @xmath27 .",
    "we can now think of the system as undergoing a sequence of lz crossings ( represented by the red and green lines in fig .  2 ) .",
    "at each crossing event , the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 experience some mixing .",
    "if we approximate the sweep across the degeneracy region by a linear ramp of the bias point between two points located symmetrically around the degeneracy point ( denoted by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the time at which the bias point is at the center of the avoided crossing ) , we find that the lz crossing can be approximately described by the evolution matrix : @xmath70 where the angle @xmath71 is defined by the lz transition probability @xmath72 @xmath73 is the sweep rate , and @xmath74 defines the direction of the bias sweep across the degeneracy region : @xmath75 when @xmath2 goes from positive values to negative values and @xmath76 when @xmath2 goes from negative values to positive values ( note that the sweep rates in the two directions are equal , and thus @xmath71 is independent of @xmath74 ) .",
    "the angles @xmath77 are given by @xmath78 + \\delta ( \\ln \\delta - 1 ) % \\nonumber \\\\ \\delta & = & \\frac{\\delta^2}{4v } , % \\label{eq : lzphases}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath79 is the gamma function ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed derivation ) .",
    "note that the stokes phase @xmath80 approaches zero in the slow - crossing limit ( i.e. , when @xmath81 ) , and it approaches @xmath82 in the fast - crossing limit ( i.e. , when @xmath83 ) @xcite . the description of lz crossing processes using unitary matrices of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : transfermatrix ] ) is sometimes referred to as the transfer - matrix method , which we follow here ( the term scattering matrix can also be found in the literature ) .    between each two lz crossings ,",
    "the system moves far from the degeneracy region and acquires a relative - phase factor between the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but with no mixing between them . because of the asymmetry ( i.e. , the fact that , in general , @xmath84 ) , there are two phase factors corresponding to the system being on the right or left side of the degeneracy region .",
    "we therefore find that between crossings , the system evolves by the evolution matrices : @xmath85 where @xmath86 represents the two sides of the degeneracy point ( we shall refer to them as 1 and 2 ) .    before starting to analyze the dynamics resulting from combining the above matrices , we note that the values of the angles @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 depend on where we set the boundaries between the different time steps ( i.e.  they depend on @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is therefore useful to define the boundary - independent phase factors @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath94 .",
    "we define @xmath92 and @xmath93 as half the relative phases accumulated between the energy eigenstates between the times of two successive level crossings ( ignoring in this evaluation the fact that there is mixing dynamics occurring between the states ) : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are functions that , roughly speaking , are proportional to @xmath98 times the logarithm of @xmath99 ( see eq .  [ eq : lzphases ] ) . with this definition of @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we find that the appropriate values of @xmath94 and @xmath100 are given by : @xmath101        we now have a sequence of finite time steps , each of which is described by a simple evolution matrix , as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the dynamics over a large number of driving cycles can be constructed by multiplying the evolution matrices .",
    "the evolution of the system over @xmath102 cycles is therefore described by the matrix @xmath103 with possibly some minor modifications at the beginning and end of the sequence , depending on the exact initial and final bias points @xcite .",
    "we now take a single cycle and calculate the evolution matrix that describes it .",
    "we find that @xmath104 where    @xmath105    it is useful to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : discretepropagator ] ) as @xmath106 where the subscript fc indicates that the above equation describes the evolution of the system over a full cycle of the driving field .",

    "the first matrix in the product describes a rotation by a some angle @xmath108 around an axis in the @xmath109-plane .",
    "the second matrix in the product describes a rotation by an angle @xmath110 around the @xmath6 axis .",
    "since we are looking for resonance - like dynamics ( which naturally implies the existence of a resonance condition ) , we want the angle @xmath108 to be small .",
    "this condition is satisfied in two opposite limits : the fast- and slow - crossing limits .",
    "we shall treat these two limits separately below , after making the following general observations .    with the above geometrical interpretation of the roles of the angles @xmath108 and @xmath110",
    ", the resonance condition is clear .",
    "if @xmath110 is a multiple of @xmath111 , the @xmath6-axis rotation does not affect the dynamics , and the small rotations of @xmath108 add up to produce full oscillations between the states @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath110 takes a value that is different from any multiple of @xmath111 by more than @xmath108 , the small rotations of @xmath108 will not add up in an ideal manner , and the oscillations will be suppressed @xcite . in the following subsections we treat the two limits where",
    "simple analytic formulae can be obtained .",
    "the width of the resonance can also be obtained using the geometrical picture explained above .",
    "we require that the phase factor @xmath112 be within a distance @xmath108 from a multiple of @xmath111 .",
    "starting from eq .",
    "( [ eq : thetafc ] ) , and writing @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the deviation from exact resonance , we find that the width of the resonance is given by : @xmath115 as in sec .",
    "iii , we find that in addition to the usual factor of oscillation frequency , the width of the resonance now contains the factor @xmath116 .",
    "this means that with the proper choice of parameters , the width of the resonance can be made substantially smaller than the on - resonance oscillation frequency .      in this subsection",

    "one should also note here that eq .",
    "( [ eq : simplerc ] ) is only approximate in the weak - driving limit , with a correction that is proportional to @xmath125 ( i.e. the bloch - siegert shift ) .",
    "one might therefore expect that such corrections will take over at some point , such that the amplitude @xmath10 becomes an essential part of the resonance condition .",
    "counterintuitively , however , these corrections change behaviour and vanish asymptotically for large @xmath10 ( in the fast - crossing limit ) .",
    "the fact that the two ( identical ) resonance conditions are good approximations deep in opposite limits demonstrates further that the derivation of eq .",

    "( [ eq : simplerc ] ) .",
