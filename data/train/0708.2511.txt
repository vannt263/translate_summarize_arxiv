    "the properties of the globular cluster ( gc ) systems of galaxies contain important information about the formation and evolution of the star clusters themselves as well as their host galaxies . in the local universe",
    "massive , compact young star clusters that are likely progenitors of traditionally old gcs are usually found in starburst environments such as galaxy mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or star bursting dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the metallicity of the gas out of which they form and the time since their formation can be gleaned from the properties of their simple stellar populations .",
    "therefore , massive star clusters are good tracers of significant star forming episodes in their host galaxies . also , the oldest gcs in the milky way have ages consistent with a hubble time , suggesting that they were among the earliest stellar systems to form and therefore provide us with a window into conditions in the very early universe .",
    "the observed star cluster systems in nearby galaxies are the result of the interplay between the conditions and processes during cluster formation and the processes that destroy clusters .",
    "the number of clusters that form in a given potential well depends on the cluster formation efficiency , the cluster formation history , the detailed physics of the cluster formation process , and the initial cluster mass function .",
    "all of these factors may be dependent on the initial environmental conditions such as the amount of available gas , the metallicity of the gas , and the external pressure @xcite .",
    "star clusters can then be destroyed by a combination of stellar evolution , two - body relaxation , and tidal shocking ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , cluster systems can be both augmented by the accretion of clusters during interactions or mergers and reduced by stripping via strong external tides @xcite . only by studying the properties of star clusters in different environments where different sets of processes may be significant",
    "can we constrain our theories of star cluster formation and evolution .",
    "dwarf galaxies are particularly useful objects for studies of massive star clusters .",
    "a census of the globular clusters in local group des showed that there is a large scatter in the number per galaxy .",
    "however , those that do form clusters often have specific globular cluster frequencies ( @xmath0 , number per unit luminosity ) as high as those in giant elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "larger surveys of des in the virgo and fornax clusters revealed a trend of increasing @xmath0 , or an increase in the scatter of @xmath0 , with decreasing galaxy luminosity @xcite .",
    "this trend is consistent with a constant gc formation efficiency but decreasing field star formation efficiency because of supernovae feedback from the forming clusters .",
    "@xcite also showed that the mean @xmath0  for nucleated des is about double that for non - nucleated des .",
    "this has implications for the formation of nuclei and the progenitor galaxies of non - nucleated versus nucleated des .",
    "however , the sample size was still relatively small ( 24 des in miller et al.s hst sample ) and the comparison with the gc systems of dis was limited to dis in the local group , which is a very different environment from the virgo or fornax clusters . therefore , the _ hst _  wfpc2 surveys were extended to include more de galaxies and some di galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters @xcite .",
    "also , a search for gcs in 57 dwarfs in nearby groups and in the field was carried out by @xcite and the virgo and fornax clusters have also been surveyed with acs on hst @xcite .",
    "finally the sample of galaxies with studied cluster systems is large enough to start making meaningful comparisons between different types of dwarfs in different environments .",
    "these large samples are also needed for studying the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) in des .",
    "each dwarf has only a few gcs , so samples from different galaxies must be combined into a composite gclf @xcite . because dwarfs have lower density disks than galaxies like the milky way , the dominant processes that destroy gc will work more slowly in them .",
    "therefore , the gclf , more precisely the gc mass function , in dwarfs has presumably undergone less modification and is closer to the initial gc mass function than in the gc systems of giant spiral or elliptical galaxies .",
    "any differences in the gc mass function must be explainable by theories of gc formation and destruction combined with hierarchical models of the merging of galaxies and the formation of gc systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , in this paper we present an analysis of the gclf and specific luminosities and masses for the full 69 galaxy sample from the _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 dwarf elliptical snapshot survey @xcite .",
    "the observations are summarized in section  [ sec : obs ] and the new analysis and results are given in section  [ sec : results ] and discussed in section  [ sec : disc ] . throughout the work use the _ hst _  cepheid key project @xcite distances to the galaxy clusters : @xmath6 ; @xmath7 ; @xmath8 .",
    "imaging of the 69 de galaxies in the _ hst _  dwarf elliptical snapshot survey was obtained with wfpc2 on the _ hubble space telescope _  in cycles 6 , 7 , and 9 ( go programs 6352 , 7377 , and 8500 ) .",
    "the galaxies were selected from catalogs of the virgo and fornax clusters @xcite and the leo group @xcite .",
    "the de galaxies have absolute magnitudes in the range @xmath9 and includes 45 nucleated galaxies and 24 non - nucleated galaxies .",
    "the images were taken with the f555w ( @xmath10  sec ) and f814w ( 300  sec ) filters and the galaxies were centered on chip wf3 to maximize the spatial coverage .",
    "more details about the final data reduction , the selection of the gc candidates , and the photometry can be found in @xcite .",
    "the global properties of the sample galaxies and the net number of gc candidates per galaxy are given in tables  [ tab : densmpl ] and [ tab : denonsmpl ] for nucleated and non - nucleated galaxies , respectively . to quickly summarize @xcite , the gc candidates are selected to be compact ( @xmath11  pixels ) and to have colors typical of gcs ( @xmath12 with @xmath13 ) .",
    "`` object+background '' candidates are those within 5 scale lengths of the centers of the galaxies while `` background '' candidates are those detected outside of 5 scale lengths .",
    "the net number of gc candidates in a galaxy , @xmath14 , is then the number of `` object+background '' candidates minus the number of `` background '' candidates scaled to the area within 5 scale lengths .",
    "these values of @xmath14 do include the nuclei .",
    "this is justified for the fainter nuclei since their properties are essentially indistinguishable from bright gcs @xcite .",
    "the brighter nuclei may form from mergers of gcs or star formation on top of an existing central gc ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] and * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to count a bright nucleus as at least one gc .",
    "it should be noted that the subtraction of the bright gcs , or even all nuclei , from @xmath14 does not qualitatively change the results of this paper .",
    "the values of @xmath14 in tables  [ tab : densmpl ] and [ tab : denonsmpl ] should be the same as those in tables  2 and 3 of @xcite .",
    "however , we have found some sorting errors in the last column of tables  2 and 3 of that paper have been corrected in the current tables .",
    "only column @xmath14 of the tables in @xcite has sorting errors and this does not affect any results in that paper .",
    "as can been seen from tables  [ tab : densmpl ] and [ tab : denonsmpl ] , the typical galaxy in our sample has about 6 gc candidates and the maximum number in any one galaxy is 52 in vcc  940 .",
    "therefore , no single galaxy has enough clusters to yield an accurate luminosity function .",
    "therefore , as is common practice in these types of analyzes , we must combine the gc candidates from many galaxies to derive a mean de gc luminosity function ( gclf ) . in this case",
    ", we derive the gclf for the galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters separately since all the galaxies in each cluster are at approximately the same distance . obtaining the net gclf",
    "requires correction for foreground / background objects and the photometric completeness function .",
    "subtracting the foreground and background contamination is similar to what is done to determine @xmath14 , but now all gc candidates for a given galaxy cluster are considered as an ensemble .",
    "the total sample of `` object '' candidates is a merged list of all the object candidates ( within 5 scale lengths ) .",
    "likewise , the total sample of `` background '' candidates includes all candidates classified previously as background .",
    "the background lf is then scaled by the ratio of the total areas used for selecting the `` object '' and `` background '' candidates .",
    "the completeness curve is derived using standard artificial `` cluster '' tests .",
    "the object psfs used for the tests are the sum of several bright gc candidates taken from the wf3 image of vcc  1254 .",
    "artificial gcs of different magnitudes are then added to representative wfpc2 images using the daophot task addstar in iraf . during each trial",
    "the number of artificial objects added is only 20% of the number of actual objects found in a given magnitude bin so that the artificial objects do not affect the crowding in the image .",
    "hundreds of trials are run in order to build up adequate statistics .",
    "the same object detection algorithm used to select the actual candidates is then used to detect the artificial gcs and the ratio of the objects found to the objects added gives the completeness fraction .",
    "the completeness function is then characterized by pritchet s interpolation function @xcite .",
    "the completeness functions for the virgo and fornax samples are shown in figure  [ fig : cplt ] .",
    "the limiting magnitudes , where the completeness fraction drops to 0.5 , are @xmath15 and @xmath16 but differ slightly between virgo and fornax cluster images .",
    "this may be due to small changes in the mean sky background .",
    "the background subtraction and fitting of the gclfs are done using the method of @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting parameters of either a gaussian or a @xmath2 distribution are found using a maximum - likelihood technique which avoids binning the data and takes into account the completeness function and the photometric error as a function of magnitude .",
    "the quoted mean parameter values and their errors are from one - dimensional projections of the two - dimensional maximum - likelihood distribution . as found by @xcite and @xcite , the @xmath2 distribution , @xmath17^{-3},\\ ] ]",
    "gives a better fit than a gaussian distribution because the power - law form of the wings of the @xmath2 distribution matches the gclf better than the exponential form of a gaussian .",
    "therefore , we only quote the results of the @xmath2 fits .",
    "@xcite showed that the integrated properties of de gc candidates and de nuclei are very similar .",
    "photometrically nuclei are like bright , somewhat red , globular clusters .",
    "therefore , we first calculate the gclf of gc candidates and nuclei together .",
    "the gclfs are given in tables  [ tab : gclfvgo ] , [ tab : gclffnx ] , and [ tab : gclfi ] and are shown in figures  [ fig : gclfallv ] and [ fig : gclfalli ] .",
    "the parameters of the best fits are given in table  [ tab : gclf ] .",
    "the parameters for the candidates in the virgo cluster are much more accurate than the parameters from the fornax cluster because the virgo cluster is 0.5  mag closer than fornax , so clusters are detected further down the gclf , and because the virgo sample is larger . both the absolute peak magnitudes and the widths are the same within the errors with mean values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 and @xmath20  mag . in theory",
    "the equivalent gaussian width is @xmath21  mag .",
    "however , in practice the widths from gaussian fits are narrower than the theory would predict",
    ". a gaussian fit to the virgo gc@xmath22nuclei sample gives @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath2 fit and narrower than expected analytically .",
    "it is also of interest to look at the luminosity functions of the gc candidates without the nuclei and of the nuclei themselves .",
    "the gclf parameters for the gc sample that excludes the nuclei are given in table  [ tab : gclf ] and they are the same , within the errors , to the sample with gcs plus nuclei . figure  [ fig : lfnuc ] shows the luminosity function of the nuclei themselves .",
    "for this fit the magnitudes of the nuclei in the fornax galaxies have been adjusted to the distance of the virgo cluster .",
    "the lf of the nuclei is peaked with @xmath25 ( table  [ tab : gclf ] ) .    in the virgo cluster",
    "there are a sufficient number of galaxies that we can also look for differences in the gclf between nucleated and non - nucleated galaxies .",
    "the gclf for de ,",
    "n galaxies , excluding the nuclei , gives @xmath26 ( table  [ tab : gclf ] ) . including the nuclei gives an indistinguishable result of @xmath27 .",
    "not surprisingly given that the majority of the total sample of virgo gcs come from de , n , the gclf peak for the de , n galaxies of @xmath28 is similar to the result for the full sample ( table  [ tab : gclf ] ) .",
    "the peak magnitude for the de , non galaxies is @xmath29 , 0.2 magnitudes brighter than that of the de , n galaxies , but this difference has a significance of only 1.2 sigma .",
    "therefore , @xmath30-band the gclfs in de , ns and de , nons are the same within the uncertainties .",
    "thus far we have assumed that all the galaxies in sample are at the mean distances of their respective groups or clusters .",
    "however , each of these physical structures has some depth , recent distance measurements of galaxies in the virgo cluster have shown that it has a line - of - site depth of between 3 and 4  mpc @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have run monte - carlo simulations of composite gclfs drawn from 69 galaxies drawn from gaussian distance distributions with a mean of 15.3  mpc and sigma parameters between 1  mpc and 4  mpc .",
    "the distribution of galaxy absolute magnitudes is the same as for the actual sample .",
    "the number of simulated clusters per galaxy is derived from a fit to @xmath31 vs.  @xmath32 , modulated for poisson statistics the distribution of simulated gc brightness comes from a @xmath2 distribution with @xmath33 and @xmath34 at our assumed distance of the virgo cluster .",
    "the parameters of the combined gclfs were measured with the same procedure used for the real data .",
    "the results of the simulations are shown in table  [ tab : gclfsim ] .",
    "as the line - of - sight distribution of galaxies increases the measured peak becomes systematically brighter and broader than the actual distribution .",
    "however , as long as the sigma of the galaxy distribution is less than 2  mpc ( corresponding to a line - of - sight fwhm of 4.7  mpc ) , the systematic errors are not significant",
    ". also , none of the galaxies in our sample are members of substructures such as the w , w@xmath35 , or m clouds that are more distant than the main virgo cluster .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our results for @xmath36 and @xmath37 are not significantly biased by the finite depths of the virgo and fornax clusters .",
    "a log - normal or gaussian luminosity distribution per unit magnitude can also be described by a broken power - law when converted to number per unit luminosity @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : gclf2]a shows the background - subtracted luminosity function @xmath38 versus log luminosity for gcs and nuclei in the virgo sub - sample .",
    "the best - fitting @xmath2 function from figure  [ fig : gclfallv ]  is plotted with the dashed line . above @xmath39",
    "the gclf is well - fit with a power - law with slope @xmath5 ( straight black line ) .",
    "the result is the same if the nuclei are excluded .",
    "this slope is consistent with the bright - end gclf slopes for young star clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and old gcs in spiral and elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite claimed that the break in the power - law gclf is present only for galaxies brighter than @xmath40 but that the gclf for fainter galaxies is an unbroken power - law .",
    "figure  [ fig : gclf2]b shows the gclf ( gc @xmath22 nuclei ) for virgo galaxies with @xmath41 and the values are given in table  [ tab : gclfvgo_faint ] .",
    "the limit of @xmath42 was chosen because there is a natural break in the distribution of @xmath43 for the wfpc2 sample at this value .",
    "the best - fitting power - law has a slope @xmath44 ( solid line ) , consistent with that for the full sample . because of the smaller sample size there is less evidence for a break in the power - law . the best - fitting @xmath2 function ( dash - dot line )",
    "has a brighter peak and a much broader @xmath37 than the best fit for the full sample .",
    "however , the standard fit for the full sample ( dashed line ) is still a reasonable match to the data .",
    "deeper data and a bigger sample are needed to confirm whether the gclf for faint galaxies in the virgo cluster is different from the gclf for the brighter galaxies .      specific globular cluster frequency , @xmath0 ,",
    "is defined as the number of globular clusters per unit @xmath30-band luminosity , normalized at @xmath45 : @xmath46 where @xmath31 is the total number of globular clusters @xcite . with the completeness function and luminosity function known we can correct @xmath14 for the undetected portion of the gclf and then calculate @xmath0 .",
    "the completeness corrections are determined by dividing the integrals of the measured gclfs alone by the integrals of the gclfs multiplied by the completeness functions .",
    "these factors are 1.04 , 1.17 , and 1.24 for leo , virgo , and fornax , respectively . for the galaxy absolute magnitude we use @xmath47 , where 0.77 is the mean @xmath48 color for the de galaxies in the study of @xcite .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "data itself can not be used to determine the total @xmath30 magnitude in all cases since the signal - to - noise for many of the fainter galaxies is not enough to give a reliable magnitude .",
    "the computed values for @xmath31 and @xmath0  are given in tables  [ tab : denprop ] and [ tab : denonprop ] and plotted in figure  [ fig : snmv ] .",
    "the overall trends noticed by @xcite in a subset of the current data are still apparent , @xmath0  increases with increasing @xmath43 ( decreasing luminosity ) .",
    "also , on average nucleated galaxies have higher @xmath0  than non - nucleated galaxies : @xmath49 and @xmath50 where the uncertainties are the standard deviations of the mean .",
    "these values are slightly higher than the values in @xcite since the current , larger sample contains more faint galaxies which typically have higher values of @xmath0 .    since @xmath0  is correlated with galaxy absolute magnitude , it is also correlation with any other property that depends on the galaxy brightness .",
    "for example , it is well known that the surface brightness profiles of faint des have sersic exponents near 1 ( exponential ) while brighter des are more cuspy with exponents approaching 4 , equivalent to an @xmath51 profile @xcite .",
    "put another way , more luminous des have higher surface brightnesses .",
    "figure  [ fig : snsb ] shows how the scatter in @xmath0  increases with decreasing central surface brightness for the sub - sample of the current sample in @xcite .",
    "the mean central surface brightness from sersic fits for 14 de , n galaxies is @xmath52 while for 10 de , non galaxies it is about 1 magnitude fainter , @xmath53 .",
    "there is also an environmental dependence on @xmath0  in the sense that the number density of de , n galaxies is more centrally concentrated than that of the bright de , non galaxies in the virgo and fornax clusters @xcite . however , there is no direct radial dependence on @xmath0  with projected radial position within the virgo cluster or with projected radial distance from the nearest bright ( @xmath54 ) galaxy ( figure  [ fig : vgoradsn ] ) .",
    "@xmath0  is a very useful quantity since it is dependent only on basic measurements and it has a long history in the literature for comparison .",
    "however , because it is based on a luminosity it is applicable only to old stellar systems with similar mass - to - light ( @xmath55 ) ratios .",
    "it is important to be able to compare the star cluster systems in different types of galaxies , so a quantity like @xmath0  is needed that is independent of @xmath55 . such a parameter is the @xmath56 parameter of @xcite , @xmath57 where @xmath31 is the total number of clusters and @xmath58 is the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "@xmath55 values are not available for each galaxy so we have adopted @xmath59 , a typical value for de galaxies from the spectroscopic measurements of @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath60  for the current sample are given in tables  [ tab : denprop ] and [ tab : denonprop ] .",
    "not surprisingly , figure  [ fig : tvmgal ] shows that @xmath60  exhibits the same trends with galaxy mass as @xmath0  has with @xmath43 .",
    "likewise , the mean @xmath60  for the nucleated galaxies is about a factor of two higher than the mean for the non - nucleated galaxies : @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    finally , it is of interest to estimate the mass fraction of the stellar light currently in star clusters . because of the uncertainties in estimating the total mass in gcs in any galaxy given the small number statistics , we calculate the mass in two ways and average the results . in both cases",
    "we assume @xmath63 for each",
    "the `` specific mass '' , or percentage of stellar mass in gcs is @xmath64    in the first method we take advantage of the fact that we believe that we know the form of the mass function .",
    "the total mass of clusters should then be roughly equal to the mean cluster mass times the number of clusters . integrating over @xmath65",
    ", @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the @xmath2 function shown in figure  [ fig : gclf2]a and we assume @xmath63 , gives a mean mass of @xmath68  @xmath69 .",
    "the mass fraction then is given by @xmath70 .",
    "in the second method , the magnitude of each object in the `` object+background '' sample is converted to a mass assuming @xmath71 .",
    "second , from the total ( gc + background ) and background luminosity functions we compute a probability that an object of a given magnitude is an actual gc rather than a background object , @xmath72 for example , in figure  [ fig : gclfallv ] the @xmath73 are the thick solid curves ( normalized column 2 of tables  [ tab : gclfvgo ] and [ tab : gclffnx ] ) and the @xmath74 are the dotted curves ( column 3 of tables  [ tab : gclfvgo ] and [ tab : gclffnx ] ) .",
    "a fourth order polynomial is fit to @xmath75 in order to smooth it and the results for the virgo and fornax samples are shown in figure  [ fig : gcprob ] .",
    "the total mass of clusters for each galaxy is then the sum of the cluster masses times the probability that each is an actual cluster .",
    "no additional correction is made for the unobserved portions of the gclfs , but this should be a small factor since most of the mass is in the most massive clusters .",
    "the two methods give results that are consistent within about a factor of two .",
    "the mean values of @xmath76  from these two methods and their uncertainties are also in tables  [ tab : denprop ] and [ tab : denonprop ] .",
    "the trends in @xmath76  with galaxy mass are similar to those seen with the other parameters ( see figure  [ fig : tmmgal ] ) and the mean values are @xmath77 and @xmath78 . the mean for the non - nucleated dwarfs is biased by one outlying point , vcc  1781 with @xmath79 .",
    "removing this point gives @xmath80 .",
    "an important question is whether the globular cluster luminosity and mass functions in dwarf galaxies are the same as those in spiral or giant ellipticals .",
    "the comparison will have implications for theories of globular cluster formation and evolution and will put constraints on the fraction of globular clusters in different types of giant galaxies that were formed in dwarf galaxies and later accreted .",
    "first we compare our results on the form of the gclf and gc mass function in des with previous authors and then address the issue of how the gclf of des compares with other types of galaxies .",
    "our best measurement of the shape of the gclf comes from the virgo sample .",
    "the @xmath30-band gclf for the virgo des is well - fit by a @xmath2 or gaussian function with @xmath81 and @xmath82 mag ( as mentioned above , a gaussian fit give @xmath83 ) .",
    "@xcite measured the gclf peak from a sample of 11 virgo des to be @xmath84 . with @xmath85 and using our adopted distance modulus of 30.92 for virgo , this gives @xmath86 which is not consistent with our results .",
    "@xcite have recently studied the gc systems of a sample of dwarfs with distances between 2 and 6  mpc with _",
    "the gclf for the des has a peak at @xmath87 but at @xmath88 the numbers continue to rise instead of decrease .",
    "our data do not go deep enough to investigate the shape of the faint end of the gclf .",
    "also , @xcite have studied the system of @xmath89 gcs in the virgo de vcc  1087 and found that @xmath90 . with @xmath91 @xcite ,",
    "this gives @xmath92 for @xmath93 ( mean virgo distance modulus ) or @xmath94 for @xmath95 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sbf distance ) .",
    "therefore , this result is consistent with ours within the uncertainties in the peak measurement and the distance .    in the @xmath96-band",
    "we find @xmath97 for the virgo cluster de `` gc @xmath22 nuclei '' gclf and @xmath98 for the fornax cluster de `` gc @xmath22 nuclei '' gclf .",
    "these values are fainter than the gclf turnover luminosity for giant ellipticals , @xmath99 , found by @xcite .    the literature to date has been somewhat undecided about whether the gclf of de differs from that of giant ellipticals .",
    "figure  2 of the review of @xcite , which includes only the four local group des with gcs known at the time , shows a small but statistically insignificant trend that the gclf peak in dwarfs may be fainter than in giants . based on the statistics available harris concluded that the gclf peak is fairly independent of galaxy mass .",
    "@xcite found that the the peak from their de sample was 0.4  mag fainter than the gclf peak of m87 from @xcite . note that durrell s gclf peak is about 0.5  mag fainter than is currently found .",
    "@xcite claim that a comparison of gclf peaks in des and ges in virgo are consistent .",
    "however , @xcite , using the same acs virgo survey dataset , find that the gclf peak magnitudes tend to scatter towards fainter values in lower - luminosity galaxies .",
    "recently @xcite have done a systematic analysis of the literature to determine if there are differences in the gclf peaks between the gc systems of the galaxy , m31 , and giant ellipticals .",
    "all distances were put on a consistent scale calibrated to rr  lyraes and cepheids assuming that @xmath100 .",
    "similar selection criteria are used for the milky way and m31 samples .",
    "metallicity corrections to the cepheid distances to the galaxies used to calibrate the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method are from theoretical models rather than the empirical relation used by the _ hst",

    "this is the same as the metallicity of the metal - poor gc samples from @xcite , so no additional metallicity correction to the de gclf peak is needed and @xmath3    a comparison of the gclf peak results is shown in figure  [ fig : gclfpeak ] .",
    "except for the three filled circles all of the values have been adjusted , where appropriate , to use the hst key project distance moduli used in this paper .",
    "the three filled circles use di  criscienzo et al.s preferred distance scale which implies a virgo distance modulus of @xmath109 . in general , the peak gclf magnitudes for the des",
    "are fainter than the peak magnitudes for the mw , m31 , and ges , though the statistical significance in each individual result is only 11.5 sigma .",
    "the indication from all the results together is that the gclf peak in des is similar to or fainter by @xmath110 magnitudes than the peak in giant galaxies . that our @xmath96-band peak magnitudes are also @xmath111 mag fainter than those measured in giant ellipticals adds support to this result .",

    "also , comparing mean properties is problematic given the increase in dispersion with diminishing mass .",

    "the lower @xmath0  or @xmath1  in higher - mass dwarfs is due to the merging of small halos , many of which do not have gcs since they virialized after @xmath160",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the results of these simulations with the larger set of dwarf galaxy data presented here .",
    "also , observational ages and total halo masses are needed to test the results of these simulations .    at a given mass",
    "there is considerable scatter in @xmath1 , especially for the dwarfs , from 0 to a value given approximately by equation  [ eqn : tmax ] .",
    "at least some of this scatter should be due to intrinsic variations in properties and processes . in the model of @xcite variations in @xmath1",
    "would be produced by variations in the gc formation efficiency , @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , natural variations in the initial gas fraction and the details of the star formation and ism - feedback processes will affect @xmath1 .",
    "it is likely that stochastic effects become more important in lower - mass galaxies since single star formation events can have global impacts .",
    "variations in @xmath55 will also contribute to the scatter .",
    "the differences between nucleated and non - nucleated des and the comparison with des and dis in clusters and the field suggest shows that environmental effects are important .",

    "@xcite has shown that interactions can produce gas inflow and central star formation that can lead to nuclei .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the progenitors of de , n galaxies were those that experienced significant interactions , either because they were formed deeper in the potential well of the galaxy cluster or because of the particular characteristics of their orbits .",
    "virgo and fornax represent different environments in that they have very different galaxy number densities , yet we do nt see a significant difference in the de gclfs of the two clusters",
    ". processes on a `` local scale '' that depend on the dwarf s location within a cluster can affect its star cluster formation history hence the difference between de , n , de , non and dis .",
    "but these processes are fairly similar in virgo and fornax ( and do nt strongly depend on the galaxy cluster mass or density ) so we do nt encounter a large difference between the two galaxy clusters .    presumably the cumulative effect of `` local '' processes that affect star cluster formation ( e.g.  interactions , ram - pressure stripping ) do depend on the galaxy cluster properties .",
    "for example , cluster velocity dispersion affects the nature of interactions and the efficiency of ram pressure stripping .",
    "therefore , more massive clusters could have different de to di and de , n to de , non ratios than less massive clusters .",
    "the similarities seen here between virgo and fornax may be due to the selection effect that we are only considering true des that have completed the transformation from dis .",
    "therefore , the star - formation histories of des in virgo and fornax are not that different .",
    "the gclfs for a mass - selected dwarf galaxy population that includes more di and transition objects may show some dependence on galaxy cluster properties .",
    "higher star formation rates will produce both new star clusters and field stars . to enhance @xmath0  or @xmath1 the process must be biased in favor of star clusters .",
    "this would occur if star cluster formation occurs first and the subsequent supernovae , perhaps aided by ram pressure stripping , truncates field star formation @xcite .",
    "this is plausible since star cluster formation probably occurs in the densest , most rapidly collapsing regions of gas .",
    "the field stars that are formed in the galaxies centers will produce the higher central surface brightnesses seen in luminous de , n ( see figure  [ fig : snsb ] ) .",
    "luminous nuclei can then form via the merging of central gcs via dynamical friction @xcite . because the star formation occurs over an extended period , especially in the more massive galaxies",
    ", this will lead to massive nuclei which are redder , younger , and more metal - rich than the typical gc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "some predictions of simple dynamical friction calculations do not agree with the observations @xcite so additional observations and more sophisticated modeling are needed .",
    "this paper has explored the globular cluster luminosity functions and specific frequencies for the full sample of 69 galaxies in the _ hst_wfpc2 de snapshot survey .",
    "the data has been combined with new complementary surveys of star clusters in a wide range of galaxy types .",
    "the main results are :    1 .",
    "the gclfs of the des in the present sample are well - represented with a @xmath2 function .",
    "the metallicity - corrected peak of the gclf for virgo des is @xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with most other recent measurements of the gclf peaks in des .",
    "this result along with recent results from the literature give a fairly clear indication that the gclf peak in des is fainter by @xmath4 magnitudes , on average , than the metal - poor peak in spirals and giant ellipticals .",
    "this is suggestive that less gc destruction has occurred in dwarfs but more data is needed to confirm this result .",
    "2 .   the bright - end slope of the luminosity distribution has a power - law form with slope @xmath5 , consistent with the bright - end slope in most previous studies and with the slope of the mass function of young , luminous clusters in starbursting systems .",
    "3 .   the trend of increasing @xmath0  with decreasing luminosity seen in earlier studies is confirmed .",
    "likewise , we continue to see that de , n galaxies have a mean value of @xmath0  about a factor of two higher than the mean for de , non galaxies . 4 .   in order to compare the metal - poor gcss of different types of galaxies we compute @xmath1 , the number of gcs normalized to galaxy mass .",
    "all galaxies with @xmath162 show a consistent trend of increasing @xmath1  with decreasing galaxy mass .",
    "the slope of the trend in @xmath1  is consistent with the sne - wind models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "5 .   assuming a universal gclf the percentage of stellar mass in gcs is @xmath143 . for galaxies that have formed gcs , @xmath142  ranges from 0.02 for spirals and low - luminosity ellipticals to about 10 for the faintest dwarfs .",
    "recent large , uniform surveys of star cluster systems in all types of galaxies , dwarf galaxies in particular , are starting to reveal more clearly the complicated interaction between cluster formation , the feedback of that formation on the evolution of galaxies , and the importance of environments . while the cluster mass function appears to be universal within the uncertainties ,",
    "there is growing evidence that the bend in the gclf of dwarf galaxies is at a lower luminosity , or mass , than in giant galaxies due to less dynamical evolution .",
    "it is still uncertain whether the gclf of low mass galaxies is a nearly pristine power law . also , clearly feedback and galaxy mass are fundamental parameters",
    ". theories of supernovae driven winds can explain the tends of @xmath1  with galaxy mass and show that low - mass galaxies will have difficulty retaining the products of star formation .",
    "this also explains why higher mass dwarfs have a higher fraction of redder , more metal - rich star clusters @xcite .",
    "however , the differences in @xmath1  and the spatial distributions of de , n and de , non galaxies also indicate the importance of environment ( i.e. cluster core , cluster outskirts , or field ) .    while this work has illuminated some of the fundamental processes of star cluster formation , ( i.e. the shape of the cluster mass function and the dependence of @xmath1  and @xmath142  on host galaxy mass ) , future work is needed to constrain cluster formation histories and their dependence on environment .",
    "the ages and metallicities either measured directly or inferred from colors suggest a common period of star cluster formation in all galaxy types and environments very soon after the first stars began to form .",
    "however , as explained in general terms by theories and simulations of galaxy and structure formation , a given potential well in a high density environment can collapse earlier and have a higher average star formation rates than the same potential in a low - density environments .",
    "this picture predicts that star clusters formed in high - density environments should be slightly older than those formed in low - density environments .",
    "this may be seen in globular clusters in the milky way that are thought to have been accreted from dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "more accurate abundances , @xmath163 $ ] ratios , and ages of a wide sample of star clusters and nuclei are needed to confirm these predictions .",
