    "with the progress in laser technology in recent years @xcite , the focused laser field strengths increased rapidly to exceed the strength of the coulomb fields that bind the electrons in the ground state of an atom or molecule .",
    "such intense light fields have led to the discovery of novel aspects of light - matter interactions , such as multi - photon ionization , above - threshold ionization , high harmonic generation , multiple ionization to high charge states , coulomb explosion etc .",
    "the lowest - order perturbation theory of light - matter interaction is known to break down at light intensities above about @xmath0 w/@xmath1 for near optical wavelengths @xcite .",
    "several nonperturbative theories of laser - matter interaction , such as the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) @xcite , ab - initio methods based on the floquet theorem @xcite , basic set expansion methods @xcite or @xmath2-matrix and related theories @xcite , have been developed . among these the solution of the tdse on a time - space grid",
    "is considered as a rigorous and powerful approach . for the investigation of most of the above - mentioned intense - field phenomena",
    "the simulation of an atom with @xmath3 electrons , which would require the solution of a set of @xmath4 dimensional partial differential equations , can be well approximated using the single - active - electron ( sae ) model @xcite . in the latter only one of the electrons of the atom",
    "is considered to become active and to interact with the external field , which reduces the numerical problem to at most three dimensions .",
    "any symmetry of the external field may further reduce the dimensionality .",
    "accurate solutions of time - dependent problems on the grid require not only relatively dense grid points but , in general , also a huge spatial extension of the grid to account for the release and the motion of the electron sub - wave packets in the field",
    ". these factors result in large memory and cpu requirements for the numerical solution at high field intensities .",
    "fortunately , the important dynamics of several intense - field processes occur on a spatial volume close to the atom or molecule .",
    "a few examples are the determination of ionization rates @xcite and high harmonic spectra @xcite or the identification of dominant pathways to single @xcite or nonsequential double ionization @xcite of a molecule .",
    "these studies can be therefore performed on a relatively small grid neglecting the exact form of the outgoing ionizing parts of the wave function .",
    "it however requires to suppress reflections from the edges of the numerical grid , which can cause artificial effects , e.g. in the form of spurious harmonics in high harmonic spectra @xcite .    in calculations based on the numerical propagation of wave packets in different areas of physics and chemistry several techniques",
    "have been proposed to compensate for reflections , including masking functions ( or equivalently absorbing imaginary potentials ) @xcite , repetitive projection and siegert state expansion methods @xcite , complex coordinate rotation or exterior complex scaling @xcite and others . in the numerical solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation of atoms in intense laser fields masking functions or absorbing potentials",
    "are the most commonly used techniques ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the ecs technique is rarely used in this context up to now @xcite , which might be due to the fact , that its application in the electric field ( or length ) gauge has been thought to be not fruitful @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we re - examine the implementation of the exterior complex scaling ( ecs ) method @xcite as absorbing boundary condition in simulations of strong - field problems .",
    "in particular , we focus on the application of the ecs technique in different gauges , namely the length and the velocity gauge . on the basis of results of simulations of 1d model atom exposed to an oscillating external field",
    ", we investigate appropriate restrictions of the ecs transformation of the external - field coupling to avoid undesired effects in the absorbing area .",
    "results for the probability density and momentum distributions for the interaction of the hydrogen atom with an intense laser field are then compared with those obtained using the standard masking function technique .",
    "finally , we consider a typical strong - field problem by using the ecs method to calculate high harmonic spectra .",
    "the complex scaling method has been widely used in physics and chemistry ( for a review , see @xcite ) , e.g. in the theory of potential scattering @xcite , calculation of resonances in atoms and molecules @xcite or the calculation of cross sections in scattering processes @xcite . according to this method the radial coordinate of the particles",
    "are scaled by a complex phase factor , which distorts the spectrum of the hamiltonian such that the continuous spectrum is rotated in the complex energy plane and the discrete resonance eigenvalues are revealed . for our aim to introduce absorbing boundaries at the edges of a numerical grid in time - dependent simulations we make use of an extension of the complex scaling method , namely the exterior complex scaling ( ecs ) technique @xcite , in which the spatial coordinates are only scaled outside some distance from the origin .",

    "real coordinates are used in the interior box , defined by @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the zones in gray mark the areas , where one or both coordinates are complex . ]    as discussed at the outset the ecs technique has been used before @xcite in time - dependent studies of electron impact ionization as well as of the motion of a charged particle in dc and ac electromagnetic fields . in the latter context it has been mentioned @xcite that it appears to be not fruitful to apply ecs in the electric field ( or length ) gauge .",
    "we now revisit this question and analyze below how ecs can be used in both the length and the velocity gauges in simulations of atoms exposed to intense laser pulses .",
    "first , we illustrate the implementation of the ecs technique in 1d and 2d time - dependent calculations , it is straightforward to extend it to higher dimensions ( c.f .",
    "let us consider the non - relativistic electron dynamics in a time - independent ( coulomb ) potential @xmath7 and an external field governed by the time - dependent schrdinger equation in cylinder coordinates as ( hartree atomic units , @xmath8 , are used throughout ) : @xmath9\\psi(z,\\rho;t)\\ ] ] with the time - indepentent hamiltonian @xmath10 and time - dependent external - field coupling , given in length or velocity gauge , as @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the electric field and @xmath13 is the vector potential of the external electromagnetic pulse linearly polarized along the @xmath14-direction .",

    "the effect of the first factor in eqs .",
    "( [ ecs1 ] ) and ( [ ecs2 ] ) is most clearly seen in the results of the low - frequency calculations , where we observe an explosion of the wave - funtion in the second part of the evolution after a significant part of the wavefunction has entered the complex area .",
    "this is obviously due to the fact that the term acts as a source over a half cycle of the pulse .",
    "as expected above the same unphysical feature is found in the length as well as in the velocity gauge . in the high - frequency case ( left - hand column )",
    "the results obtained in the two gauges are again similar , but we do not observe a significant amount of explosion .",
    "this difference as compared to the ti : sapphire calculations is probably due to two factors : first , in the high - frequency simulation the probability density , which enters the complex area , is smaller than in the low - frequency calculations .",
    "second , the rapid change of the sign of the electric field or the vector potential may effectively prevent an explosion , since the complex factor quickly changes between decay and source nature .    from the results presented above we",
    "may therefore infer that the ecs transformation may lead to unphysical results in both gauges due to the oscillating nature of the external field . the most straightforward strategy to circumvent this problem appears to simply neglect the ecs transformation of the coordinates in the field coupling term .",

    "in particular in the low - frequency case ( right hand column ) the wavefunction is absorbed at the edges of the grid and no signature of explosion is seen anymore .",
    "we may therefore conclude that the exterior complex scaling technique can be applied as an absorbing boundary to time - dependent simulations on laser - atom simulations in the length as well as in the velocity gauge as long as the complex factors in eqs .",
    "( [ ecs1 ] ) and ( [ ecs2 ] ) are removed .",

    "our analysis above shows that an analogous restriction is possible in the length gauge as well .",
    "our test calculations have shown that , in general , after omission of the unstable factors calculations in the length gauge show slightly better results than those in the velocity gauge .",
