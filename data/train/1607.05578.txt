    ", the controllability of the linearised system around the trivial trajectory and the classical inverse mapping theorem between proper functional spaces would imply the controllability of the nonlinear system ( [ eq : vns ] ) .",

    ", we can give an explicit solution of ( [ eq : linearised ] ) , which writes @xmath60 as pointed out in @xcite , there exist two obstructions for controllability , which are :    small velocities : :    a certain @xmath61    can have a `` good direction '' with respect to the control region    @xmath28 , in the sense that @xmath62    meets @xmath28 at some time .",

    ", we deduce that the linearised system is not controllable in general .      in order to circumvent these difficulties",
    ", we use the return method , due to j .- m .",
    "the idea of this method , in the case under study , is to construct a reference trajectory @xmath65 starting from @xmath66 and coming back to @xmath66 at some fixed time in such a way the linearised system around it is controllable .",

    "let us make some comments about the possible limitations of this result .",
    "first of all , we observe that a natural limitation concerning dimension comes from the difficulties presented by the three - dimensional navier - stokes system .",
    "in particular , since the uniqueness of weak solutions for this system is still unknown , there is no hope , a priori , to obtain better results when considering the coupling with a vlasov equation .    on the other hand , the navier - stokes in dimension 2 allows the use of fine stability estimates and a certain regularising effect , which permits the definition of classical characteristics associated with the velocity field .",
    "this is essential to describe the absorption procedure of section [ sec : fixedpointvns ] .",
    "let us emphasise that the controllability result of theorem [ thm : controllability ] allows to control at the same time the distribution function of particles and the motion of the fluid in which they are immersed .",
    "this can be done thanks to the return method , by exploiting in a crucial manner the two coupling terms of the system : the coupling term in the vlasov equation and the drag force term present in the navier - stokes system .",
    "furthermore , we can achieve the control of all the components with a scalar control acting only on the vlasov equation .",
    "this kind of feature is already well understood in the case of the navier - stokes system @xcite , where the controlled component is arbitrary . in the vlasov - navier - stokes case ,",
    "our methods work only if the controlled component is the distribution function .",
    "the result of theorem [ thm : controllability ] can be seen as a kinetic version of the result obtained for a fluid - structure system in @xcite ( see @xcite for a three - dimensional result ) . indeed , whereas the fluid - structure problems aims at controlling the trajectory of a macroscopic body immersed in a fluid , the kinetic approach allows to treat the dynamics of a cloud of microscopic particles in a fluid , replacing the individual effects of particles by a mesoscopic description .",
    "let us recall a well - posedness result for the non - stationary stokes system , i.e. , @xmath577 due to y. giga and h. sohr ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.8 , p.82 ) ) .",
    "this result gives a very general framework for the @xmath578 well - posedness , under suitable assumptions on the data .",
