    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be two probability measures on @xmath4 such that @xmath3 is absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath2 . if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are @xmath5-additive then , as shown by @xcite , the conditional probabilities of @xmath2 and @xmath3 merge , in the sense that the two posteriors become uniformly close as the amount of observations increases ( @xmath3-almost surely ) .",
    "so , repeated applications of bayes rule lead to consensus among bayesian agents , provided that their opinions were initially compatible .",
    "now consider savage s axiomatization of subjective probability .",

    "opinion_. savage s framework allows for finitely additive probabilities that are not @xmath5-additive .",
    "in particular , the conclusions of the blackwell and dubins theorem hold for some , but not all , opinions .",
    "this flexibility makes savage s framework an ideal candidate to study the connection between the merging and the testing of opinions .",
    "we say that an opinion @xmath2 satisfies the _ blackwell  dubins property _ if whenever @xmath3 is an opinion absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath2 , the two conditional probabilities merge . by definition , in this subframework , sufficient data produces agreement among bayesian agents who have compatible initial opinions . outside this subframework",
    ", bayesian agents may satisfy savage s axioms , have compatible initial opinions and yet persistently disagree .",
    "see the for an example .",
    "any opinion , whether or not it satisfies the blackwell and dubins property , can be tested and rejected . to reject an opinion @xmath2",
    ", it suffices to find an event that has low probability according to @xmath2 and then reject it if this event is observed .",
    "thus , if opinions are honestly reported then the connection between merging and testing opinions is weak . in the absence of incentive problems ,",
    "subjective probabilities can be tested and rejected whether or not data produces consensus .",
    "now consider the case in which a self - proclaimed expert , named bob , may strategically misrepresent what he knows .",
    "let alice be a tester who wants to determine whether bob is an informed expert who honestly reports what he believes or he is an uninformed , but strategic , expert who has reputational concerns and wants to pass alice s test .",
    "alice faces an adverse selection problem and uses data to screen the two types of experts .",
    "a test is likely to _ control for type i error _ if an informed expert expects to pass the test by truthfully reporting what he believes .",
    "a test can be _ manipulated _ if even completely uninformed experts are likely to pass the test , no matter how the data unfolds in the future .",
    "the word `` likely '' refers to a possible randomization by the strategic expert to manipulate the test . only nonmanipulable tests that control for type i error pass",
    "informed experts and may fail uninformed ones .",
    "our main results are : in the presence of incentive problems , if opinions must satisfy the blackwell  dubins property then there exists a test that controls for type  i error and can not be manipulated .",
    "if , instead , any opinion is allowed then every test that controls for type i error can be manipulated .",
    "thus , in savage s framework strategic experts can not be discredited .",
    "however , strategic experts can be discredited if opinions are restricted to a subframework where data produces consensus among bayesian agents with initially compatible views .",
    "these results show a strong connection between the merging and the testing of opinions but only under incentive problems .",
    "the blackwell  dubins theorem has an additional interpretation . in this interpretation ,",
    "@xmath3 is referred to as the data generating process and @xmath2 is an agent s belief initially compatible with @xmath3 .",
    "when the conclusions of the blackwell  dubins theorem hold , then @xmath2 and @xmath3 merge and so , the agent s predictions are eventually accurate .",
    "thus , multiple repetitions of bayes rule transforms the available evidence into a near perfect guide to the future .",
    "it follows that our main results also have an additional interpretation . under incentive problems , strategic experts",
    "can only be discredited if they are restricted to a subframework where opinions that are compatible with the data generating process are eventually accurate .",
    "finally , our results relate the literatures on bayesian learning and the literature on testing strategic experts ( see the next section for references ) .",
