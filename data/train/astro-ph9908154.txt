    "( 1999 ) discussion , have effective temperatures between 1400 and 2000 k with no @xmath76 absorption , but every brown dwarf with @xmath77 passes through the l dwarf region as it cools , with those of higher mass passing through later ( burrows , _ et al .",
    "the number of l - type brown dwarfs at any epoch depends on the birth rate , the initial mass function , and the evolution of these failed stars ( reid , _ et al .",
    "if the birth rate is assumed known and a theory of evolution adopted , the dependence of the number of visible l dwarfs on the mass function can be used to constrain the latter .",
    "if a power law distribution of mass is assumed , the steeper distributions lead to more visible l dwarfs , and the index is constrained by the observed volume density of l dwarfs in the region reasonably close ( @xmath78 pc ) to the sun .",
    "this procedure leads to @xmath79 for @xmath80 based on information from the denis and 2mass surveys ( reid _ et al .",
    "although model dependent , this result is the first determination of the brown dwarf mass function based on observational data .",
    "what are the implications for the microlensing time scale frequency distribution ?",
    "several star counts yield @xmath81 for @xmath82 with steeper slopes for more massive stars ( e.g. basu & rana 1992 ; holtzman _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ; reid _ et al .",
    "we shall use the holtzman _",
    "mass functions and modifications thereof in the examples .",
    "figure 1 shows the time scale frequency distributions for the above galactic model for a line of sight toward @xmath83 , which is representative of an average ( see peale 1998 ) over the directions to 24 fields observed by the macho ( massive compact halo objects ) group during the 1993 bulge season . during this season",
    "12.6 million stars were monitored for 189 days ( alcock _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) leading to the choice of ordinate in figure 1 .",
    "the distributions are shown for the holtzman _",
    "( 1998 ) mass function ( solid line ) and three modifications , two of which include brown dwarfs down to @xmath84 to accommodate the new discoveries . for continuation of the main sequence mass function into the brown dwarf region with slope -1 ,",
    "the mass of the brown dwarfs is only 5.5% of that of the main sequence stars , and it is about 7% of the main sequence star mass with the reid _ et al . _",
    "slope of -1.3 , where continuity of the mass function is assumed .",
    "these brown dwarf masses are 8% and 10% , respectively , of those main sequence stars with @xmath85a range more appropriate to the solar neighborhood .",
    "the third modification contains no brown dwarfs but has many more low mass , hydrogen burning stars , and it yields a time scale frequency distribution closely matching the empirical data .",
    "( the peaks of these curves are raised by about 10% if the value of @xmath86 km / sec found by mendez _",
    "( 1999 ) is appropriate for the flat part of the galaxy rotation curve . )",
    "all the mass functions are continuous and are normalized to yield a bulge mass of @xmath87 and a mass density at the sun s position in the disk of @xmath88 .",
    "the empirical time scale frequency distribution from the macho 1993 bulge season ( alcock _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) , adjusted for observing efficiencies and binned into 5 day intervals , is shown for comparison .    as found by several authors ( e.g. peale 1998 ) , mass functions with @xmath81 in the m star region fail to yield a sufficient number of short time scale events near the peak of the empirical distribution _ for the simplest galactic models consistent with observations_. adding the reid _",
    "_ brown dwarfs to the holtzman _ et al",
    ". _ distribution with either the -1.3 or -1 slope increases the number of short time scale events as expected , but both extensions of the mass function fail to yield a sufficient number of short time scale events near the peak of the alcock _",
    "results , and , perhaps more importantly , the peaks of the predicted distributions are shifted toward smaller time scales ( 3 - 5 days ) than those of the observed peak ( 5 - 10 days ) .",
    "( see peale ( 1998 ) for similar consequences for other extensions of the mass function into the brown dwarf region . )",
    "a fairly good match to the empirical data is obtained in figure 1 by increasing the fraction of low mass , but still hydrogen burning stars with a continuation of the -2.2 slope of the holtzman _",
    "_ mass function down to @xmath89 .",
    "the chosen model of the galaxy used in calculating the predicted time scale frequency distributions is consistent with observations ( zhao 1996 , 1998 ) , although many parameters are poorly constrained ( zhao 1998 ) .",
    "if the galaxy model is assumed to be close to the real galaxy , and the local population of brown dwarfs extends throughout the galaxy , then the macho collaboration should have seen a larger fraction of events with 3 - 5 day time scales .",
    "one could conclude that the absence of these events means that there are fewer brown dwarfs in the bulge , where most of the lenses reside , than observed locally .",
    "however , the same caveats and reservations about microlensing constraints on the mass function emphasized by peale ( 1998 ) apply here .",
    "the meagerness of the published microlensing data for bulge events precludes definitive microlensing constraints on the distribution of stars in the galaxy or the mass function , although there are more than 200 events that have not yet been analyzed that would improve this situation .",
    "we also point out that the 10 events in the bin corresponding to time scales from 5 to 10 days in figure 1 involve two clump giant sources with detection efficiencies of about 0.6 and eight much less luminous turnoff and possibly more blended stars as sources with detection efficiencies of 0.15 to 0.2 ( alcock _ et al .",
    "the average of the reciprocals of the efficiencies is nearly 5 meaning this element of the histogram is almost 5 times higher than the actual number of detected events .",
    "the sampling efficiencies for a given time scale event for a distribution of source brightnesses are determined empirically and should be reasonably sound , but the reduction of these efficiencies due to blending of the source stars with other nearby stars by a factor of 0.75 is just an estimate ( alcock et al 1996 ) . until the detection efficiencies for bulge events are determined more rigorously , even the empirical distribution of macho time scales that we are trying to match is only a first approximation .",
    "could the detection efficiency for the 3 - 5 day events be even smaller than the alcock _",
    "_ estimate ?",
    "if so , this element of the histogram would be raised , although it seems unlikely that this region could become the peak of the distribution and thereby accommodate the brown dwarfs .",
    "if the empirical distribution approximates reality , the brown dwarfs might be accommodated by reducing the velocity dispersion ( see examples in peale 1998 ) , but unrealistically low dispersions would be necessary to shift the peak to the macho value , and increasing the mass of the galaxy to yield the observed peak frequency of events would result in too many events with @xmath90 days . finally , one notices the several very long time scale events in the macho distribution that are not consistent with any of the models .",
    "these events may be due to there being more close lenses , such as a spiral arm concentration , where the relative angular velocity of source and lens is small , than are accounted for in the axisymmetric disk model .",
    "other than the triaxial bulge , deviations from axial symmetry in the galaxy model are ignored .",
    "in addition , streaming velocities superposed on the galactic rotation are not accounted for .",
    "could some combination of such additional degrees of freedom hide a galaxy - wide distribution of brown dwarfs in the microlensing data ?",
    "one can not be sure without better constraints on galactic structure and velocity parameters .",
    "for the present , the addition of the brown dwarfs to the mass function appears to widen the discrepancies between predicted and observed microlensing time scale frequency distributions ."
