    "this should be compared to the much smaller @xmath221gauss given in ref .",
    "@xcite for the electroweak transition .",
    "however , we stress here again  @xcite that more important than the magnetic field strength on some large scale @xmath222kpc should be the total magnetic energy on all scales .",
    "numerical simulations show  @xcite that gravitationally induced inverse cascades during cluster collapse seems to transfer this magnetic power to large scales .",
    "we thus restate here  @xcite the prediction for present day magnetic field strength and coherence length as a function of magnetogenesis temperature @xmath223 , initial magnetic / turbulent energy density , @xmath224 ( in units of radiation energy density ) , and initial helicity @xmath225 ( as a fraction of maximal helicity ) @xmath226 for non - helical fields and @xmath227 for helical fields . here",
    "( [ eq : bc0exnohel ] ) assumes a spectral index @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper we have considered the large - scale ( small wavenumber @xmath11 ) tail of primordial magnetic fields produced `` causally '' ( i.e. not during an inflationary epoch ) in the early universe .",
    "here we focussed on scales which are instantaneously super - hubble during the initial magnetogenesis epoch , i.e. @xmath228pc , as such scales correspond to current galactic scales .",
    "it has been claimed  @xcite that due to causality such fields are highly supressed .",
    "i.e. @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) . we have shown here that this may not be the case .",
    "it is customarily assumed that an initial period of magnetogenesis ( e.g. during a phase transition ) may be well separated from the subsequent epoch of freely decaying mhd . in other words ,",
    "field production only happens during the magnetogenesis epoch , whereas subsequently only field dissipation takes place .",
    "however , this is not the case , magnetic field on large scales may be continously generated due to nonlinear interactions of small scale fluid- and magnetic- modes , even well after the initial epoch of magnetogenesis .",
    "we have shown that , with the expansion of the universe , this process is rapid enough to yield scale - dependent equipartition between fluid velocities and magnetic fields on ever and ever larger scales .",
    "in particular , barring super - equipartion values of the magnetic field , this implies that the kinetic- and magnetic- energy tail could have the same spectral index . as white noise @xmath3 for the fluid",
    "is expected  @xcite , the magnetic field tail could also develop @xmath3 .",
    "when the realistic alternation of turbulent and viscous mhd ( due to photon- and neutrino- fluid viscosity ) in the early universe is considered , the evolution becomes substantially more complicated .",
    "we have followed this with a semi - analytic treatment . during turbulent epochs the fluid forces equipartition with magnetic fields on small scales .",
    "after this , amplification of large - scale magnetic fields due to non - linear interactions between velocity- and magnetic- modes on small scales becomes important .",
    "when fluid viscosity becomes considerable , all fluid flows up to the neutrino ( photon ) diffusion scale become erased , and the process of amplification of large - scale magnetic fields effectively stops .",
    "only when neutrino ( photon ) interaction with the plasma become very weak , new fluid flows are generated by the priorly generated and frozen in magnetic fields .",
    "thus the fluid initial kinetic energy had been stored in magnetic field energy .",
    "subsequently further large - scale magnetic field amplification takes place .",
    "as complicated as is , the net result of these processes is a present day large - scale magnetic field tail essentially indistinguishable from that if the universe would have stayed turbulent throughout .",
    "however , we caution that our results are preliminary , as our evolution equation may not include all magnetic sink terms on large scales . those were assumed to become important only at scale - dependent equipartition , i.e. when @xmath161 .",
    "furthermore , backreaction of magnetic fields on fluid flows was only taken into account in a heuristic way . a complete analysis , which is beyond the scope of the present paper ,",
    "should be performed to confirm our results .",
    "the resulting magnetic field spectrum may thus be @xmath3 up to some large scale @xmath229 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : leqmin ] ) and @xmath2 beyond .",
    "this would lead to considerably larger magnetic field strength on large scales than claimed in ref .  @xcite .",
