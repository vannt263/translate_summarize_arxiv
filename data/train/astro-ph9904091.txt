    "the compact non - thermal radio source sgr  a * has long been recognized as a massive black hole candidate .",

    "linear polarization stands as one of the few observables of sgr  a * not extensively investigated observationally or theoretically .",
    "however , we expect linear polarization to arise from the cyclo - synchrotron radiation that is responsible for the radio to millimeter wavelength spectrum .",
    "a homogeneous , optically - thin , synchrotron source with a uniform magnetic field has a fractional polarization of 70% .",
    "measured fractional polarizations in agn are typically a few percent at wavelengths shorter than 6 cm where the compact cores dominate the highly - polarized radio lobes in the total flux ( e.g. , aller , aller & hughes 1992 ) .",
    "however , polarization vlbi images sometimes show regions of significantly enhanced polarization ( brown , roberts & wardle 1994 ) .",
    "the polarization of sgr  a * may prove to be as important a diagnostic of models for the radio to millimeter spectrum as it has been for agn .",
    "detection of linear polarization in agn has firmly established synchrotron emission as the radiation mechanism .",
    "comparison of the evolution of linear polarization to the evolution of total intensity has provided a strong argument for the existence of shocks in the relativistic jets of agn ( e.g. , hughes , aller and aller 1985 ) .",
    "detection of similar correlations in polarized and total intensity variations in sgr  a * would be convincing evidence for a jet . other models may have unique signatures for polarized intensity variations .",
    "sgr  a * is located in a region with strong magnetic fields and high electron density .",
    "the image of sgr  a * is significantly scatter - broadened by intervening thermal plasma ( e.g. , lo _ et al .",

    "in an ionized and magnetized region right and left circularly polarized waves will have different indices of refraction .",
    "this leads to a wavelength - dependent delay between circular polarizations which is equivalent to a rotation of the position angle @xmath6 of a linearly polarized signal @xmath7 where rm is the rotation measure .",
    "this rotation of @xmath6 is equivalent to a rotation in the two - dimensional stokes @xmath8 and @xmath9 space .",
    "a linearly polarized signal will be significantly depolarized in an observing bandwidth @xmath10 if @xmath6 rotates by more than one radian , or if the rm exceeds @xmath11 if the bandwidth @xmath10 is split into @xmath12 channels , a search can be made for rms larger than @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath6 wraps through more than one turn , @xmath14 ambiguities make it impossible through a linear least squares fit to detect rms .",

    "the maximum rm detectable in this scheme can be found by replacing @xmath10 with @xmath17 in equation  [ eqn : rmmax ] .",
    "in addition to detecting rms that exceed @xmath13 , the technique is sensitive to multiple rms from the same object .",

    "imaging sgr a * with and without rm corrections , we find a fractional polarization of 0.1% .",

    "the scattering region will depolarize the signal if @xmath35 . for our observing wavelengths , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . over the scattering size of 50 mas at 4.8 ghz",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath38",
    ".    observed variations in rm in the gc region are many orders of magnitude below those necessary to depolarize sgr a*. observations on the arcsecond to arcminute scale of a nonthermal filament within 1 degree of sgr a * find a maximum @xmath39 ( yusef - zadeh , wardle & parastaran 1997 ) .",
    "extrapolation of the rm structure function to the scattering size implies @xmath40 .",
    "however , these observations are made on a much larger scale than the scattering disk of sgr a * and the scattering medium is believed to be inhomogeneous .",
    "could the more extreme conditions necessary to depolarize sgr a * exist in the galactic center scattering region ? the rm is expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the electron number density in @xmath43 , @xmath44 is the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight in @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the size scale in pc . since @xmath46 must be a fraction of the scattering diameter , we find @xmath47 .",
    "yusef - zadeh _ et al .  _",
    "( 1994 ) argued that the photo - ionized skins of molecular clouds in the gc region have a similar length scale , milligauss fields and @xmath48 .",
    "this matches the depolarization condition if the regions are fully turbulent .",
    "however , if the constraints on the outer scale of turbulence derived by lazio & cordes ( 1998 ) are correct , then @xmath49 . in this case",
    ", the rm condition and pressure balance between the magnetic and thermal components can only be satisfied if @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "these conditions are extreme even for the gc region",
    ". the largest magnetic fields as measured for oh masers are on the order of a few milligauss ( e.g. , yusef - zadeh _ et al .  _",
    "ionized densities measured for h ii regions on the arcsecond scale ( @xmath52 pc ) are significantly less than @xmath53 ( mehringer _ et al .",
    "no depolarization is predicted for the higher temperature and lower density model of lazio & cordes ( 1998 ) for @xmath54 .",
    "the conditions necessary to depolarize at 8.4 ghz are even more extreme .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the conditions necessary to depolarize sgr a * are unlikely to occur in the scattering region .",
    "we consider now whether depolarization may occur in the accretion region of sgr a * , where the electron density and magnetic field strength are large but the length scale is smaller . if we consider the simplest model of spherical infall with @xmath55 and equipartition between particle , magnetic and gravitational energy ( melia 1994 ) , then the change @xmath56 over an interval @xmath57 at a radius @xmath58 from sgr a * is @xmath59 where we have expressed @xmath58 and @xmath57 in units of the gravitational radius @xmath60 for a @xmath61 black hole .",
    "this relation only holds for @xmath62 , where the temperature falls below @xmath63 .",
    "the rm inside of this radius is negligible unless there is a separate population of cold electrons .",
    "we consider the effect of cold electrons in more detail in the following section .",
    "if the scattering screen is at a distance of 100 pc from sgr a * , then the image will be an average of ray paths over a tangential length scale @xmath64 .",
    "fluctuations in the rm will depolarize sgr a * at a given radius if @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the outer scale of turbulence .",
    "assuming @xmath68 , we find that depolarization will occur only if @xmath69 .",
    "although this scale is much smaller than the outer scale in the local ism ( armstrong , rickett & spangler 1995 ) , it is a scale that may be pertinent to the dense , energetic environment of the accretion region .",
    "a polarization fraction less than 1% is uncommon in compact radio sources at wavelengths shorter than 6 cm ( aller , aller & hughes 1992 ) .",
    "however , optically thick quasar cores observed with vlbi are frequently weakly polarized ( cawthorne et al . 1993 ) . such cores may be analogous to the radio source in sgr a * , which , due to its low power , may not produce the strong shocks in the jet that are the source for higher polarization regions in quasars .",
    "weak polarization is more common in radio galaxies than quasars or blazars and it is also more common in compact - double sources or sources with irregular morphologies ( aller , aller & hughes 1992 ) . a notable source with a very low polarization fraction ( @xmath70 ) is the radio galaxy 3c 84 , which has a very irregular morphology .    if the radio to millimeter spectrum of sgr a * does arise in a jet , the low power of this jet or environmental effects in the galactic center region may limit the magnetic field order . for the case of a spherically symmetric emitting region ,",
    "an ordered magnetic field may depolarize the source , as well .",
    "alternatively , low energy electrons in the synchrotron environment of sgr a * may faraday depolarize the source .",
    "the adaf model and the bondi - hoyle accretion model predict the presence of non - relativistic electrons in the accretion region .",
    "observations at millimeter wavelengths may resolve many of the questions raised in this paper .",
    "interstellar effects are reduced such that depolarization in the scattering region is extremely unlikely and depolarization in the accretion region must occur at radii less than 0.01 pc .",
    "furthermore , the synchrotron emission arises from a more compact and presumably more homogeneous region .",
    "the source may also have less synchrotron self - absorption at millimeter wavelengths , although this is not required by all models .",
