    "more than three decades ago , @xcite and @xcite found the first observational evidence for second , and thicker , disk components in external edge - on galaxies .",
    "a few years later @xcite found the first evidence for a second stellar component in the milky way disk by studying the stellar density as a function of distance from the galactic plane towards the galactic north pole .",
    "since then the general consensus has been that also the milky way harbours a dual disk stellar system , a thin disk and a thick disk .",
    "recent studies actually show that many , if not all , edge - on spiral galaxies appears to host dual disk systems @xcite . as the milky way currently is the only galaxy that can be studied in great detail with high - resolution spectrographs , and may serve as a `` benchmark galaxy '' for extra - galactic studies , it is utterly important , also in the context of galaxy formation and as tests of models of galaxy formation , to establish the properties of the different milky way stellar populations .    since the discovery of the galactic thick disk many observational studies have aimed at characterising the stellar disk ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the observational evidence presented by these studies have so far pointed to two disk populations with different chemical and age properties indicating that the galactic thin and thick disk have different origins and have experienced different chemical histories .",
    "however , albeit more than two decades of observational effort we are still lacking much information about the complex abundance structure of the galactic stellar disk .",
    "for instance , the geneva - copenhagen survey ( hereafter gcs ) by @xcite contains approximately 16000 dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood , all of which have full three - dimensional kinematic information available , as well as ages and metallicities estimated from strmgren @xmath0 photometry .",
    "it is evident from the gcs that there is a lot of kinematic sub - structure in the solar neighbourhood ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] ) .",
    "while the thin and thick disks are the dominating populations there are many smaller structures superimposed on the underlying disk distribution .",
    "most of these are young streams and moving groups that belong to the thin disk , but there are also features such as the hercules stream that share some of the thick disk kinematic properties ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it has later been shown that the hercules stream most likely is a dynamical feature in velocity space caused by the galactic bar , and that it consists of a mixture of thin and thick disk stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "looking at the gcs data it is also evident that stars with typical thick - disk kinematics can be found at high metallicities , even well above solar ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vfeh ] ) .",
    "the question is where the high - metallicity limit of the thick disk is and if these stars are true thick disk stars ?",
    "it is also not clear to how low metallicities the thin disk reach , and if there is a gap in the abundance trends between the thin and thick disks .",
    "i will here highlight some of the characteristics of the galactic thick disk with focus on results from high - resolution spectroscopic studies during the last 10 to 15 years .",
    "this is no exhaustive and full summary , and there are several other aspects of the thick disk that needs further attention .",
    "in summary , the general consensus regarding the thick disk is that it has a metallicity distribution ( mdf ) that peaks around @xmath1\\approx -0.6 $ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , while the thin disk mdf peaks at @xmath1\\approx 0 $ ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . at a given metallicity",
    "the thick disk stars show higher enhancement in the @xmath2-element abundances than the thin disk stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for an @xmath2-element , such as o , mg , si , ca , or ti , the [ @xmath2/fe ] abundance ratio for the thick disk shows a flat plateau from @xmath1\\approx -1 $ ] to @xmath3 , hereafter it starts to decline toward solar values .",
    "the plateau is caused by the rapid chemical enrichment from massive stars , while the down - turn , or `` knee '' is attributed to the onset of enrichment from snia .",
    "the appearance of the thin disk [ @xmath2/fe ] abundance trends are quite different , starting out a lower enhancement , and then showing a constant slow decline toward super - solar metallicities .",
    "an example of the thin and thick disk abundance trends is shown for oxygen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ofe ] .",
    "furthermore , the stars of the thick disk are generally old with ages between 8 to 12gyr , in contrast to the stars of the thin disk that usually are young ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it may also contain an age - metallicity relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) which the thin disk does not have .",
    "the existence , or non - existence , of radial and vertical abundance gradients in the thick disk is difficult to establish due to the problems of selecting clean thin and thick disk stellar samples .",
    "however , using the sdss segue dwarf sample @xcite see a flat radial gradient for stars located 1 to 1.5kpc from the plane that most likely can be associated with the thick disk .",
    "also , from 22000 stars in sdss dr3 @xcite finds a flat radial metallicity gradient for the thick disk between galactocentric radii 4 to 15kpc , and furthermore that no vertical abundance gradient is apparent for the thick disk .",
    "klaus fuhrmann has in a series of papers @xcite analysed what is quoted as a volume - complete sample of all nearby ( @xmath4pc ) mid - f - type to early k - type stars down to @xmath5 and north of a declination of @xmath6 .",
    "this analysis is particularly valuable thanks to its internal consistency and homogeneity . in these papers",
    "fuhrmann finds that there are essentially two types of stars in his sample : stars with high abundances of mg relative to fe , and stars with low abundances of mg relative to fe .",
    "the two subsets overlap significantly in [ fe / h ] . the stars with higher [ mg / fe ] abundance ratios are also the oldest stars . both sets of stars , but in particular the low [ mg / fe ] stars , show a very tight abundance trend for [ mg / fe ] versus [ fe / h ]",
    "fuhrmann identifies these two sub - samples with the thick and thin disks , respectively .",
    "the identification is based on an interpretation of a combination of the age , kinematic and abundance data .",
    "in addition a few stars are found to show [ mg / fe ] ratios that are in - between those of the two major sub - samples .",
    "these are given the status of `` transition '' stars and are considered to be neither thin nor thick disk members .",
    "the most important part of these studies by fuhrmann is that they show that if a reasonably volume - complete sample is constructed for stars in the vicinity of the sun , then the elemental abundances ( and ages ) slit these stars into two major groups , one with enhanced [ mg / fe ] ratios , and one with almost solar values .",
    "however , the fuhrmann sample only contains slightly over 20 stars out of almost 400 stars that have age and abundance patterns that make them potential thick disk stars , and they only reach metallicities slightly above @xmath1\\approx -0.3 $ ] .",
    "what about the kinematically hot and metal - rich stars that are present in the gcs ?",
    "these are clearly not present in the very nearby sample , and it is evident that in order to study the thick disk at its extremes we need to probe a larger volume than fuhrmann s .      in the solar neighbourhood , in the galactic plane ,",
    "more than 90% of the stars are believed to be thin - disk stars , and less than 10% thick - disk stars .",
    "however , as the thin disk has a much shorter scale - height than the thick disk , the relative stellar density between the two populations will vary with distance from the plane . assuming scale - heights of 300pc and 1000pc , and normalisations of 90% and 10% , for the thin and thick disks , respectively , fig .  [",
    "fig : stellardensity ] shows how the stellar density varies as a function of distance from the galactic plane .",
    "one sees that at a distance of 1kpc from the plane the thin and thick disk stellar densities are about the same , and that at distances greater than 2kpc the thick disk clearly dominates over the thin disk .",
    "hence one needs to go to distances of at least @xmath7kpc from the plane in order to get a relatively clean thick disk sample ( the stellar halo starts to dominate much farther from the plane ) .",
    "however , at these distances f and g dwarf stars have magnitudes around 16 to 17 making it very time consuming to get high - resolution spectra with high signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "they are simply too faint even for today s large 8 - 10 m telescopes to observe in large quantities .    what has instead been done",
    "the past 10 to 15 years is to rely on kinematic criteria to select candidate thick disk stars from nearby stellar samples ( typically within 100 - 200pc from the sun , i.e. , the hipparcos sphere ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to calculate probabilities one needs an estimation of the overall velocity distribution ( and assuming gaussian distributions ) of the stellar population , how much its lags behind the local standard of rest ( lsr ) , and its relative stellar density in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the best values for the velocity distributions , rotational lags , and normalisations , are often difficult to estimate , but some commonly used values are listed in table  [ tab : kinematic ] .    . [",
    "tab : kinematic ] characteristics for stellar populations in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "columns ( 2)-(4 ) give the velocity dispersions for the different populations in col .",
    "( 1 ) ; cols .",
    "( 5)-(6 ) give the the asymmetric drifts ( in @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) relative to the lsr ; and col .",
    "( 7 ) gives the normalisation fractions for each population in the solar neighbourhood ( in the galactic plane ) .",
    "values are taken from @xcite for the thin disk , thick disk , the stellar halo , and the hercules stream .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , < \" , ]     applying these criteria to a catalogue such as for example the geneva - copenhagen survey ( gcs ) @xcite , that contains roughly 16000 nearby dwarf stars with full three - dimensional kinematical information allows you to calculate probabilities for individual stars of belonging different populations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as the gcs also contains metallicities and ages based on strmgren @xmath10 photometry for a majority of the 16000 stars , give the opportunity to probe the thin and thick disks at their extreme metallicities .",
    "studies that have utilised kinematical criteria to investigate the properties of the thin and thick disks are , e.g. , @xcite , wherein nice figures can be found that show the elemental abundance trends of the thin and thick disks . in summary",
    ", the studies above generally find that the thin and thick disks have different abundance trends .",
    "a shortcoming of the kinematical method to classify stars into different populations is that it will introduce bias , or mixing , between the selected thin and thick disk samples .",
    "stars from the high - velocity tail of the thin disk will be classified as thick disk stars and stars from the low - velocity tail of the thick disk as thin disk stars . in @xcite",
    "this is investigated and it is shown that stellar age might be a better discriminator between the thin and thick disks . by selecting one sample of stars that are older than @xmath11gyr and one where",
    "the stars are younger than @xmath12gyr , the abundance trends become apparently cleaner with less mixing between the two populations ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the problems with using stellar ages is that good ages are only possible to determine for stars near or around the main sequence turn - off and on the sub - giant branch .",
    "for red giant samples or more distant samples kinematical criteria might be the only solution .",
    "one should then bear in mind that kinematic mixing could be significant .",
    "a question that has recently surfaced and been debated is if the milky way disk really has two distinct stellar populations .",
    "based on the sdss segue g and k dwarf stellar sample @xcite , @xcite instead argues that the abundance pattern of the galactic stellar disk can be represented by a continuous function of mono - abundance populations with increasing scale - heights , and hence no _ distinct _ thick disk should be claimed .",
    "if truly distinct and well - separated abundance trends between the thin and thick disks could be confirmed , the claims by @xcite could be weakened .",
    "using the data sample of 1111 stars by @xcite , clues of a two - phase formation history of the milky way disk is seen by @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite see a void of stars in the @xmath2-element abundance trends in a sample of 700 kinematically selected f and g dwarf stars .",
    "this void remains , even if stars with kinematic properties in - between the two disks are included .",
    "it becomes even clearer and more separated if the sample is constrained to a narrow range in temperature between 5600 and 6100k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gap ] ) .",
    "the stellar parameters and elemental abundances for stars outside this temperature range are more susceptible to nlte effects and uncertainties ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for discussion ) .",
    "this shows that small signatures , such as the separation between the thin and thick disk abundance trends , can be smeared out if sufficient care is not taken in the analysis and sample selection .",
    "further clues to a distinction between the thin and thick disks is hinted in their age structures .",
    "for instance , most thick disk stars have ages around 10gyr , but as you go to higher metallicities they become slightly younger , and the most metal - rich stars that can be associated with the thick disk at @xmath1\\approx 0 $ ] have ages of about 8gyr @xcite .",
    "the stars of the thin disk are , on the other hand , younger , with the oldest stars at @xmath1\\approx -0.7 $ ] being around 7gyr .",
    "this time epoch where we see a separation between the two disks , around 8gyr ago , coincides with other observational evidence for mergers between the milky way and another ( dwarf ) galaxy . for instance",
    ", @xcite and @xcite claims to have detected debris stars from a major merger @xmath1310gyr ago , and @xcite finds that the density profile of the milky way halo is broken , and that this break likely is associated with a an early ( 6 - 9 gyr ago ) and massive accretion event .",
    "the thick disk and its relationship to the thin disk has so far mainly been studied at the solar galactocentric radius .",
    "the existence of the thick disk in the inner and outer regions of the galactic disk is less established . in a first study",
    "@xcite observed 44 red giants in the inner disk at galactocentric radii between 4 to 7kpc and at different heights from the galactic plane .",
    "those results showed that the abundance trends seen in the solar neighbourhood are also seen in the inner disk region , pointing to that a dual disk structure is also present in the inner disk ( see left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : outerdisk ] ) . in a subsequent similar study of 20 red giants in the outer disk @xcite",
    ", the abundance structure appeared very different compared to the inner disk results ( see right panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : outerdisk ] ) .",
    "there were essentially no traces of the abundance signatures that usually are associated with the thick disk and which is seen in the inner disk and in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "the conclusion from @xcite was that the scale - length of the thick disk is significantly shorter than that of the thin disk , and hence the apparent lack of thick disk stars in the outer disk .",
    "evidence for a short scale - length for the thick disk was later also seen in the sdss g dwarf sample by @xcite .",
    "a possible connection between the thick disk and the galactic bulge was first presented by @xcite who showed that the @xmath2-element trends of a handful of bulge red giants to those of nearby red giants were similar , and hence that the bulge and the thick disk possibly could have had very similar chemical and star formation histories .",
    "subsequent studies of red giants ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and microlensed dwarf stars @xcite confirm the similarities in the abundance trends between the ( metal - poor ) bulge and thick disk .",
    "however , the latest paper on microlensed bulge dwarf stars show that there might be a slight difference in the abundance trends in the sense that the position of the `` knee '' in the bulge [ @xmath2/fe ] trend occurs at a slightly higher [ fe / h ] , pointing to that the star formation history was slightly faster in the bulge than in the thick disk @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : bulge ] shows the [ fe / si]-[si / h ] abundance trends for the thin and thick disk dwarf sample from @xcite and the microlensed bulge dwarfs from @xcite .",
    "additional signs of a possible connection between the bulge and the thick disk comes from that the metallicity distributions are similar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that the ages are old ( around or above 10gyr ) @xcite for thick disk and the metal - poor bulge .",
    "whether these connections imply a direct connection between the thick disk and bulge , or not , is currently unclear and needs to be further investigated .",
    "in summary , it appears as if the milky way galaxy has two stellar disk populations that are distinct in abundance space as well as in stellar ages .",
    "they do , however , appear to show a considerable overlap in velocity space",
    ". it also appears as if the radial extension of the thick disk is quite short , and that the thin disk is dominating at larger galactocentric radii .",
    "based on similarities of elemental abundances and stellar ages there might also be a connection between the metal - poor bulge and the thick disk . whether they are directly connected or if they have just experienced similar chemical and star formation histories is unclear .",
    "there are several ongoing and upcoming large spectroscopic surveys that will probe the abundance structure of the galactic disk that will help us to disentangle different stellar components and unravelling the outer disk .",
    "examples are the sdss segue @xcite , apogee @xcite , the gaia - eso survey @xcite , the galah survey ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that will provide abundance data for several hundreds of thousands of stars . combined with the astrometric data from the upcoming gaia satellite , we should get a much clearer picture of the structure , formation , and evolution of the milky way and its stellar populations .",
