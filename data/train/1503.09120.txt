    "proto - planetary nebulae ( ppns ) are objects in the short - lived evolutionary phase between asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and planetary nebulae ( pns ) .",
    "this transitional phase in the evolution of low- and intermediate - mass ( 0.8@xmath38 m@xmath4 ) stars is expected to be several thousand years long , depending upon the mass of the star @xcite .",
    "this relatively short time scale contributed to the initial difficulty in identifying stars in this stage prior to the availability of data from the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) , which became available in 1984 . _ iras _ allowed the detection of candidate objects based on their mid - infrared emission from circumstellar dust formed during the late - agb phase .",
    "a good summary of their discovery and properties is given by @xcite , while their place in the broader context of post - agb stars is described by @xcite .",
    "it soon became apparent that some of the ppns were oxygen - rich ( o - rich ) and some were carbon - rich ( c - rich ) .",
    "this was initially based on their mid - infrared spectra as obtained by _",
    "iras _ and later by the _ infrared space observatory _ ( _ iso _ ) .",
    "those that were o - rich showed amorphous silicate features at 9.7 and 18 @xmath5 m , both in emission and absorption @xcite , and _ iso _ observations also revealed crystalline silicates at a number of wavelengths between 20 and 43 @xmath5 m @xcite .",
    "those that were c - rich instead showed infrared aromatic bands between 3 and 12 @xmath5 m @xcite that are usually identified as due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules .",
    "high - resolution visible spectra supported these mid - infrared chemical classifications , with the o - rich showing c to o ratios ( c / o ) of @xmath60.5 ( summarized in this paper ) and the c - rich showing c / o ratios of 1@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the signature of the o - rich or c - rich nature can also be seen in the gaseous circumstellar nebulae , which can show oh ( o - rich ) or hcn ( c - rich ) emission in the centimeter and millimeter radio regions , respectively @xcite .",
    "photometric observations of the brighter ppns showed that they varied in brightness @xcite .",
    "subsequent long - term photometric monitoring has revealed periods for many of them , ranging from 35 to 160 days @xcite . when combined with stellar pulsation models ( eg . , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , pulsation periods and amplitudes have the potential of yielding information on the mass , luminosity , and stellar structure of these transitional objects .    in this paper",
    ", we analyze the light curve variations of four bright o - rich ppns .",
    "our observations range from 1994 to 2012 .",
    "we also include in our analysis the published complementary photometric observations of these four to increase the data sample .",
    "this combined sample extends the temporal coverage , fills in gaps in the data , and increases the density coverage . in these ways",
    "it provides an excellent sample from which to search for multiple periods and to compare with the results of our previously published c - rich sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper i ) .",
    "there is observational evidence that the transition from o - rich to c - rich chemistry occurs for stars with initial masses of approximately 1.5 to 3 m@xmath4 @xcite",
    ". thus one might expect different pulsational properties between o - rich and c - rich ppns , since they result from stars of different masses and luminosities .",
    "the four program objects are listed in table  [ object_list ] , along with some basic information .",
    "the spectra of all four have been classified as f supergiants .",
    "all have high - resolution spectral abundance studies which not only show that they are o - rich , but that they are iron - poor , with [ fe / h ] ranging from @xmath30.25 to @xmath31.1 . three of them display double - peaked spectral energy distributions ( sed ; * ? ? ?",

    "initial attention to the unusual properties of iras 17436 + 5003 ( hd 161796 , v814 her ) was drawn by @xcite , who listed it among a small group of four supergiants located at high galactic latitude . following the launch of _ iras _ , @xcite noted its large infrared excess and suggested that it might be a post - agb object , as did @xcite , who included it in a multi - wavelength study of a eight ppn candidates of f@xmath3 g spectral types .",

    "for each ppn , the constancy of the primary comparison star , c@xmath1 , was examined with respect to the other two comparison stars .",
    "the precision of the observations is not as high as we would like due to the large differences in brightness between the program and comparison stars .",

    "such a trend can be seen clearly when looking at the overall brightness - color curves , as shown in figure  [ lc_color ] .",
    "all four of these ppns are known to be variable in light and have been included in prior studies by other investigators .",
    "this is particularly true of the brightest of these sources , iras 17436 + 5003 , which has been observed by several investigators , particularly fernie .",
    "the other three sources have been observed extensively by arkhipova and collaborators , as described below .",
    "their _ ubv _ observations are carried out with a single - channel photoelectric photometer using a 27@xmath7 aperture , and they tied their observations to the _ ubv _ system by observations of standard stars .",
    "data are also available for two of the objects in the _ v _ band from the all sky automated survey ( asas ; * ? ? ?",
    "the availability of these additional observations affords an opportunity to enlarge the data sample , either in time or density or both , with the promise of better documented light curves .",
    "these in turn can yield better determined results for the period analysis , including the determination of multiple periods .",
    "this is , of course , predicated on the ability to accurately combine the different data sets .",
    "all of the investigators made differential observations , as we did , and to combine them requires accurate standardized measurements of the various comparison stars .",
    "since different investigators use different comparison stars and different aperture sizes , this can potentially lead to slight zero - point offsets in the magnitudes in the different data sets . to correct for such offsets , we compared the various data sets where they overlapped in time , to determine and correct for any such offsets .",
    "these are discussed for each star .",
    "these individually - derived offsets are well established , based on a minimum of 18 nights , and are listed in table  [ lc_offset ] , along with access to the published data sets .",
    "we briefly discuss these other studies , star by star , along with the resulting combined light curves , and we then proceed to the period analyses of each .    period studies were carried out for each of the four ppns using the period - finding program period04 @xcite .",
    "this uses a fourier transform , and it easily allows for the investigation of multiple periods .",
    "we began with the large , combined _ v _ data sets and then examined the data in subsets .",
    "for iras 18095 + 2704 and 19386 + 0155 , the general trends were first removed .",
    "the light curves each show some variations in the yearly means .",
    "we first searched the data sets for periodicity with these included , in case there were longer - term periodicities that these represented .",
    "for none of these ppns was a significant longer - term periodicity found , so we then normalized , or adjusted , the yearly data by the yearly means and then did the final period analyses on the adjusted data sets .        due to its brightness and its unusual distinction of being a high - latitude object with a supergiant spectrum , iras 17436 + 5003 ( hd 161796 ) became the target of many variability studies even before it was identified as a ppn .",
    "the most extensive of these was by fernie and collaborator @xcite , who carried on a long series of observations including most years from 1980 through 1998 .",
    "they always include _ v _ observations and from 1986 to 1998 the observations are _",
    "ubv_. beginning in 1986 , the observations were made with an automated photoelectric telescope at a good site , and the number of annual observations increased significantly .",
    "we combined with our _ v _ observations the long and consistent data set of fernie s . in comparing the data of fernie s with ours during the overlap from 1984 to 1998",
    ", we find that there are 22 dates on which we observed on the same night , and from these we find an average offest of 0.000 @xmath130.002 . thus there is no offset to apply .",
    "we extended the coverage slightly by including the data by @xcite from 1979@xmath31980 ; comparing these with those of fernie from 1980 indicated no offset .",
    "the combined _ v _ light curve is displayed in figure  [ 17436_fit ] .",
    "the agreement of the different data sets is good in the regions of overlap and very usefully increases the temporal coverage .",
    "the light curve shows a general increase in brightness of 0.04 mag from 1984 to 2012 , but the increase is not strictly monotonic .",
    "the yearly amplitude is seen to vary throughout this interval by a factor of three to four .",
    "the combination of our data with those of fernie and percy & welch gives us a relatively - long time interval of 34 years of data for iras 17436 + 5003 .",
    "this affords a good opportunity to not only find the best period(s ) for the entire data set , but to also examine the observations in smaller time intervals to investigate period changes .",
    "the data sets were first adjusted to the mean brightness of each year .",
    "years with fewer than ten data points were not included .    the analysis of the entire _ v _ data set ( set a ) revealed in several closely - spaced frequencies , as can be seen in figure  [ freqspec ] .",

    "there are in total eight significant periods in the data ; we have listed the first six in table  [ lc_per ] .",
    "the data , phased to p@xmath1 = 45.15 days , are also displayed in figure  [ freqspec ] .",
    "they show a reasonably good phased light curve , considering the observed range in amplitude seen in the light curve .",
    "the fit of the periods and amplitudes to the normalized light curve is remarkably good for most of the time interval , as can be seen in the lower five panels of figure  [ 17436_fit ] .",
    "it is only in the last decade , 2003@xmath32012 , that the fit in some seasons is not good .",
    "some of this may be due to the observed complexity of the light variations and some may be due to changes in the periods .",
    "comments about the light curve complexities and period changes were frequently made by fernie .",
    "fernie found dominant periods ranging from 38 to 62 days when he examined the observations in one or two year intervals , although most were in the range of 40@xmath346 days .",
    "fernie also drew attention to some epochs in which the star appeared to not vary @xcite .",
    "some of this complexities seem to be resolved by our inclusion of multiple periods .",
    "the data were then examined in subsets and the results are also listed in table  [ lc_per ] . the analysis of the fernie and percy & welch data ( set b , 1979@xmath31998 ) results in p@xmath1 = 45.08 @xmath13 0.01 days , p@xmath0 = 46.54 days , and p@xmath12 = 47.45 days ; these are nearly the same as the first three periods seen in the entire data set .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , since their data comprise two - thirds of the number in the entire data set .",
    "the analysis of the complete vuo data ( set c , 1994@xmath32012 ) results in p@xmath1 = 47.30 @xmath13 0.02 days , which agrees with p@xmath0 in the entire data set ( a ) , and a value for p@xmath0 that agrees with p@xmath16 in the entire data set .",

    "we conclude that no clear trends in period change emerge when comparing the data sets for an individual star in different time intervals .",

    "@xcite ran linear , radial pulsation models of post - agb stars with masses of 0.6 and 0.8 m@xmath17 and presented graphically the results for the temperature range 5000@xmath37000 k and log  _ g _ in the range of 0.0@xmath32.0 .",
    "we examined the results for t@xmath18 = 6300 k and t@xmath18 = 7000 k and log  @xmath19 in the range of 0.2 to 1.0 , the closest parameters to our stars .",

    "@xcite also carried out on - linear analyses of the unstable modes .",
    "however , the calculated values had periods that were too short ( days to a few weeks ) and amplitudes that were too small by a factor of three when compared to our observed results .",
    "the models by @xcite were non - linear models of masses of 0.6 and 0.8 m@xmath17 but of temperatures in the range of 5600 to 6000 k , cooler than our stars .",
    "we previously compared them with our observational results of two cooler ppns , but they also resulted in periods that were too short and pulsational amplitudes that were too small @xcite .",
    "this commends further pulsational modeling of post - agb stars in the temperature range of 6000@xmath38000 k , .",
    "one can also make other comparisons with the results of our study of 12 c - rich ppns in the milky way galaxy .",
    "for that sample of f@xmath3 g stars , we @xcite found a monotonic , approximately linear decrease in period ( _ p _ ) with effective temperature ( _ t@xmath2 _ ) over the range of 5000 to 8000 k. while we do not have a long enough observing interval to see an individual star change in _",

    "t@xmath2 _ to represent the average expected evolution of these stars as they evolve from large , cool agb stars to the small , hot central stars of pns .",
    "since they evolve toward higher temperatures at approximately constant luminosity , they must be decreasing in size and increasing in density ( ongoing mass loss is small ) .",

    "however , this present sample is small and all of the points , except one of those for iras 17436 + 5003 , fall within the range of the c - rich data points .",
    "when we compare the pulsation amplitude ( @xmath14v ) with their periods and temperatures ( see table  [ results ] ) , they agree well with the monotonic trends found for the c - rich sample ; all of the objects with periods shorter than 120 days and temperatures higher than 6000 k have maximum amplitudes @xmath200.22 mag .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ pt - amp ] .    as noted above ,",
    "the _ p_@xmath3_t@xmath2 _",
    "relationship for these four o - rich ppns appears to have a much steeper slope than is found for the 12 c - rich ppns .",
    "this may not be significant , since it is based on only four objects over a smaller temperature range ( 1000 k ) , and the o - rich ppns generally fall within the distribution of the c - rich sample .",
    "if it is real , one suggestion is that it relates to the difference in metallicity between the two longer - period objects ( p@xmath21110 day , [ fe / h]@xmath21@xmath31.0 ) and the two shorter - period objects ( p@xmath2145 day , [ fe / h]@xmath21@xmath30.25 ) .",
    "this would indicate that the longer - period ones derive from a more metal - poor population and thus are older and of lower mass .",
    "the non - linear radiative pulsation models by @xcite indicate longer periods for lower - mass stars , which is consistent with what we find here . however , this is only suggestive and may not be relevant since the models were for somewhat cooler ( 5600@xmath36000 k ) stars than these four .",

    "[ 17436_fit ] ) , while the lower temperature spectrum was obtained when there were no contemporaneous light curves . for iras 18095 + 2704",
    ", the spectrum was taken near maximum brightness and bluest color ( see fig .",
    "[ 18095_fit ] ) , and for iras 19386 + 0155 , between maximum and average brightness ( see fig .  [ 19386_fit ] ) . of the two spectra of iras 19475 + 3119",
    ", the higher temperature one was obtained near maximum brightness and the lower temperature one at an epoch with few photometric observations and no clear phasing of the brightness .",
    "thus , for the two objects with multiple spectroscopic temperature determinations , the higher temperatures are associated with the greater brightness in the light curves , consistent with the brightness - color correlations found from the light curves .",
    "in this paper , we have carried out a detailed light curve and period study of four bright ppns .",
    "they each had previous light curve and period studies , but by combining these data sets with ours , we have significantly increased the sample size and the time intervals of observation .",
    "the primary results are listed below .",
    "they serve to help elucidate the pulsation properties of intermediate- and low - mass post - agb during this short transition stage from the agb to the pn phases .",
    "two of them also show long - term trends of increasing brightness , with values of 0.13 and 0.30 mag over 14 and 19 years , respectively , corresponding to 0.01@xmath30.02 mag yr@xmath22 .",
    "long - term trends have been observed in about 30@xmath24 of the well - studied ppns , with five showing clear monotonic trends of increased brightness and two of decreased brightness .",
    "we attribute these to changes in the circumstellar dust opacity .",
    "a dominant period was found in each of the four , with values ranging from 41 to 113 days .",
    "similar periods had previously been found for three of these based in smaller data sets .",
    "these values fall in the period range found previously for ppns of f@xmath3 g spectral types of 38 to 153 days .",
    "\\4 . in each of the four ppns",
    ", multiple periods were determined .",
    "these account for much of the variation in amplitude seen in the light curves . in all cases ,",
    "the secondary period is close to the primary period , with an average value of p@xmath0/p@xmath1 of 0.96 .",
    "this is similar to the range of values of 0.9@xmath31.1 found in previously studied ppns with suitably long temporal data sets .",
    "these multiple periods help to explain the changing light curve amplitudes as they beat together .",
    "they also help to explain the seasonally changing periods attributed to iras 17436 , which instead are due to multiple periods affecting the light curve shape .",
    "\\5 . for these four",
    ", one finds a general trend of the cooler ones having longer periods . however , this is not a strong trend and the sample is small .",
    "all four of these are o - rich .",
    "a strong trend has been seen in c - rich f@xmath3 g spectral type ppns .",
    "these four o - rich ones have a steeper slope to their trend , but the sample is too small to determine if the slopes differ between ppns with different chemistries .",
    "all four are redder when fainter , in agreement with the brightness - color relationship found in other well - studied ppns .",
    "the maximum ( b@xmath3v ) color changes range from 0.055 to 0.105 mag , which imply changes in effective temperature of 400@xmath3770 k.    we have begun photometric studies of additional , fainter o - rich ppns , which will help to enlarge the sample and increase the range in temperature .",
    "these should help to better define the period - temperature - amplitude relationships for o - rich ppns and allow a more robust comparison with c - rich ppns .",

    "<S> multiple periods were also found for each object . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary periods were all close to the dominant periods , with p@xmath0/p@xmath1 ranging from 0.86 to 1.06 . </S>",
    "<S> the variations in color reveal maximum variations in t@xmath2 of 400 to 770 k. these variations are due to pulsations in these post - agb objects . </S>",
    "<S> maximum seasonal light variations are all less than 0.23 mag ( _ v _ ) , consistent for their temperatures and periods with the results of @xcite for 12 c - rich ppns . for all of these ppns </S>",
    "<S> , there is an inverse relationship between period and temperature ; however , there is a suggestion that the period@xmath3temperature relationship may be somewhat steeper for the o - rich than for the c - rich ppns . </S>"
