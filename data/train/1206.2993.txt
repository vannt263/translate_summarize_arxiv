    "during the last years , matter - wave dark solitons have been the focus of many research efforts in the physics of ultracold atoms , due to their ubiquitous presence in the formation and nonlinear dynamics of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite .",
    "importantly , these efforts have been driven by considerable experimental developments along this direction .",
    "in particular , experimental investigations on matter - wave dark solitons started over one decade ago  @xcite ; however , since the soliton lifetime was rather limited ( either due to the instability of dark solitons in higher - dimensional setups , or due to the detrimental effect of strong thermal fluctuations ) , these early experiments were not able to characterize many of the soliton properties .",
    "nevertheless , there has been a new generation of more controllable experiments @xcite , which have been carried out at extremely low temperatures and at least in some cases in more quasi one - dimensional ( 1d ) setups , so as to enable the definitive observation of robust moving , oscillating and potentially interacting dark solitons , in very good agreement with the corresponding theoretical predictions .",
    "furthermore , dark solitons were also observed recently in multi - component becs , where they were coupled either with dark or bright solitons , thus forming `` dark - bright ''  @xcite or `` dark - dark ''  @xcite soliton states , respectively . in the same context , and since bec experiments are obviously performed in the presence of thermal fluctuations , the study of matter - wave dark solitons in finite - temperature becs is a quite relevant and interesting problem .",
    "pertinent theoretical studies have been performed in various settings and using different approaches ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "a relevant  and analytically tractable  mean - field model that has recently gained attention @xcite ( also in the context of vortices @xcite ) is the so - called _ dissipative gross - pitaevskii equation _ ( dgpe ) .",
    "this model , which was first introduced phenomenologically @xcite and later was justified from a microscopic perspective @xcite , can describe accurately finite - temperature - induced soliton decay : results stemming from a perturbative study of soliton dynamics in the framework of dgpe , compares favorably to ones obtained by the more accurate _ stochastic gross - pitaevskii _ model @xcite ( the latter , is a grand canonical theory of thermal becs , containing damping and noise terms which describe interactions of low - energy atoms with a high - energy thermal reservoir @xcite ) .",
    "our aim in the present work is in a sense two - fold . on the one hand",
    ", we aim to study matter - wave dark solitons in thermal becs in an experimentally relevant and realizable setting . on the other hand",
    ", we are aiming to reverse engineer an interesting dynamical system that has been studied in the context of damping ( and external constant driving ) in some detail in the context of josephson junctions ; see relevant details in ch .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite and ch .  8 of ref .",
    "@xcite for physical and mathematical aspects , respectively .",
    "the present setting of becs enables the possibility of analyzing this dynamical system in the presence of an anti - damping mechanism induced by the coupling of the dark soliton to thermal fluctuations .",
    "in particular , we focus on the examination of matter - wave dark soliton dynamics in the presence of the following effects : ( i ) coupling to thermal excitations , described in the framework of the dgpe model discussed above ; ( ii ) a ( weak ) periodic , so - called optical lattice ( ol )  @xcite , potential @xcite ; ( iii ) an ( also weak ) electric or gravitational field , inducing a linear external potential ",
    "see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for an experimental realization .",
    "the steps of our analysis , and the structure of our presentation , are as follows .",
    "first , starting from a dgpe which encompasses the above potentials ( linear and periodic ) , we employ dark soliton perturbation theory  @xcite , to derive an equation of motion for the ensuing dynamics of the soliton center position ( section ii ) . motivated by its direct analogy with the equation describing josephson junction dynamics ( which has exciting features such multi - stability and hysteresis ) , we will offer a systematic local and global analysis ( fixed points and phase plane structure ) of the pertinent dynamical system . then ( in section iii ) , we will present results of systematic numerical simulations , comparing our analytical results with ones obtained from direct numerical integration of the dgpe .",
    "finally ( in section iv ) , we will summarize our results and present our conclusions , as well as some interesting possibilities for future extensions of this work .",
    "the dynamics of a quasi-1d condensate ( elongated along the @xmath0-direction ) under the presence of thermal fluctuations , can be described by the following dimensionless dgpe @xcite : @xmath1 here , subscripts denote partial derivatives , @xmath2 is the condensate wavefunction , @xmath3 is the chemical potential , and the term @xmath4 accounts for finite - temperature effects ( note that the parameter @xmath5 scales with temperature @xmath6 according to a power law , @xmath7 , with @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "finally , the external potential @xmath9 is assumed to of the form : @xmath10 where , in the right - hand side , the first term represents an electric or gravitational field of strength @xmath11 , and the second term describes an optical lattice potential of strength @xmath12 and wavenumber @xmath13 @xcite .    without the external potential and the thermal term ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath14 , eq .",
    "( [ gp ] ) possesses a dark soliton solution on top of a constant background of density @xmath3 ; this solution is of the form @xmath15 , \\label{ds_unp}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath17 is the soliton center .",
    "the amplitude and velocity of the soliton are respectively given by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while @xmath20 ( with @xmath21 ) is the soliton phase angle ( so - called `` black '' and `` grey '' solitons correspond to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively ) .    following refs .",
    "@xcite , we now seek a solution of eq .",

    "we assume that the condensate dynamics involves a fast relaxation scale to the ground state , which can be approximated in the framework of the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , as follows : @xmath28 .",
    "then , the evolution of the dark soliton on top of this ground state , is described by the following perturbed nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation : @xmath29 , \\label{perturb}\\ ] ] where we have used the scale transformations @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , and the functional perturbation @xmath33 $ ] is given by : @xmath34 = ( 1-|v|^2)vv+\\frac{1}{2}v_x v_x+\\gamma v_t.\\ ] ] below we will treat @xmath33 $ ] as a small perturbation ( at least in the spatial region where the dark soliton dynamics takes place ) , assuming that the thermal fluctuations ( governed by the parameter @xmath5 ) and the strengths @xmath12 and @xmath11 of the linear and ol potentials are weak , namely , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 . under these assumptions",
    ", we can then apply to eq .",
    "( [ perturb ] ) the perturbation theory for dark solitons , originally developed in ref .",

    "@xcite , for an application to becs confined in ols , and ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "the fundamental premise underlying the dark soliton perturbation theory is that , to the leading order of approximation , the soliton evolves adiabatically ; in other words , it preserves its form of eq .",
    "( [ ds_unp ] ) , yet its parameters , namely the phase angle @xmath20 and the position of the center @xmath38 become slowly - varying functions of time .",

    "( [ perturbeqn1 ] ) , and considering the case of almost black solitons with sufficiently small soliton phase angles , we neglect terms of order @xmath43 .",
    "then , we can derive from eqs .",
    "( [ perturbeqn1])-([perturbeqn2 ] ) an equation for the soliton center ; this equation , when expressed in the original variables , has the following form : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 for small @xmath13 .",
    "note that eq .",

    "( [ eqn_center_original ] ) can be expressed as the following dynamical system : @xmath49 it is quite remarkable that this dynamical system draws a direct analogy between the dynamics of a dark soliton in a thermal bec under the combined effect of gravity and an optical lattice , and that of a _",
    "josephson junction_. in the latter , the dynamical variable is the relative phase between the two superconducting elements , whose time derivative is associated with the voltage in the junction .",
    "the bias current is analogous to our linear field here , while the josephson current is the one that provides the periodic potential .",
    "lastly , the lossy resistor part in the original josephson junction setting ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) is replaced here by the _ anti - damping _ effect ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) induced by thermal fluctuations . it is also quite noteworthy that the original experimental setting of ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which is the closest to our present proposal , was precisely designed to examine macroscopic quantum interference between the atomic packets in adjacent wells of the lattice in close analogy to the so - called alternating - current ( ac ) josephson effect . here , we take this analogy one step further by parallelizing the motion of a dark soliton through this potential environment to the evolution of the phase of the josephson junction .",
    "let us now analyze in detail the dynamics of the system of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn_center_dark_system ] ) .",
    "first , we note that due to the periodicity of the nonlinearity in the system  ( [ eqn_center_dark_system ] ) , we will restrict the analysis to the interval @xmath52 ( one period of the periodic function within effective potential ) .",
    "second , it is relevant to observe that two different possibilities occur : the _ existence _ and _ non - existence _ of fixed points of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn_center_dark_system ] ) . obviously , fixed points exist for @xmath53 , i.e. , for @xmath54 ( existence of two fixed points ) or @xmath55 ( existence of one fixed point ) .",
    "first , we will provide the local analysis for the case @xmath54 .",
    "this case , as well as the one with @xmath55 , and the scenario where no fixed points exist , will be investigated in the next section devoted to the global analysis of the dynamics .      in the case",
    "@xmath54 , there exist _ two _ fixed points : @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath0-coordinates of the fixed points @xmath58 satisfy the transcendental equation @xmath59 and correspond to the local minimum and the local maximum of the potential energy @xmath60 respectively . to study the stability of the two fixed points , we first consider the linearization of the system ( [ eqn_center_dark_system ] ) around them , whereby the jacobian matrix reads : @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "the fixed point @xmath63 [ where its @xmath0-coordinate , @xmath64 , is the maximum of the potential energy @xmath60 ] has eigenvalues : @xmath66 since @xmath67 , it is clear that @xmath68 and @xmath69 and , hence , @xmath63 is always unstable : in fact , it is a _ saddle point _ , independently of whether @xmath70 ( corresponding to the hamiltonian variant of the model ) or @xmath51 ( corresponding to the finite - temperature case ) . on the other hand , the fixed point @xmath71 [ where its @xmath0-coordinate , @xmath64 , is the minimum of the potential energy @xmath60 ] has eigenvalues : @xmath72 in the hamiltonian case @xmath70 ( where the hamiltonian energy @xmath73 is conserved ) , the above eigenvalues are purely imaginary , i.e. , @xmath74 , and thus @xmath75 is a _ stable center _ ; in this case , the dark soliton center performs oscillatory motions around the minimum of the effective potential .",
    "however , in the finite - temperature case of @xmath51 ( where the hamiltonian energy @xmath76 is not conserved ) , we need to separate two cases .",
    "if @xmath77 ( i.e. , for sufficiently low temperatures ) , the eigenvalues are complex with positive real part and , thus , the fixed point @xmath75 is an _",
    "unstable spiral_. physically , this means that the dark soliton center will perform a motion with an oscillatory growing amplitude around the minimum of the effective potential , with a growth rate @xmath78 and an oscillation frequency : @xmath79 on the other hand , if @xmath5 is sufficiently large ( such that @xmath80 ) , the fixed point @xmath75 becomes an _",
    "unstable node_. physically , this means that the dark soliton center will perform a motion with an exponentially growing amplitude .",
    "note that , in both cases , the soliton will eventually decay at the rims of the condensate .    at this point",
    ", we should mention that the local analysis highlights the emergence of , at least , two different bifurcations .",
    "first , the transition from @xmath70 to finite @xmath51 is a bifurcation whereby the minimum of the effective potential changes stability : it becomes from stable center an unstable spiral , with the eigenvalues becoming , from purely imaginary , genuinely complex with positive real part .",
    "second , if @xmath5 is further increased so as to exceed the critical value @xmath81 the character of the instability changes via another bifurcation : the fixed point , from unstable spiral becomes an unstable node , with the eigenvalues turning , from genuinely complex , to real positive ( via a collision on the real axis ) .",
    "however , the global analysis that will be discussed in the next section will reveal , in the regime @xmath82 , a third type of bifurcation : a saddle connection breaking , which is relative to the behavior of the unstable manifolds of the saddle point @xmath75 . to conclude this section",
    ", we will now consider the case @xmath55 , as well as the scenario where no fixed points exist . in the first case ,",
    "there exists solely one fixed point , say @xmath83 , which occurs from the collision between @xmath84 and @xmath85 when @xmath86 .",
    "then , the jacobian of eq .",
    "( [ jac ] ) has eigenvalues @xmath87 and @xmath88 . in this case , the linear stability analysis is insufficient to provide any information about the stability of @xmath89 .",
    "both the critical case and that of the absence of fixed points will be examined by means of global analysis of the system  see below .",
    "let us now study the global phase portrait of the system ( [ eqn_center_dark_system ] ) .",
    "we will use two fundamental theorems for flows in two - dimensional phase spaces , namely the _",
    "hopf bifurcation theorem _",
    "( see , e.g. , theorem 3.4.2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the _ poincar - bendixson theorem _ ( see , e.g. , theorem 1.1.19 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , combined with a _",
    "nullcline analysis_. the latter , is an analysis of the direction of the flow around the curves consisting of the points on which the vector field is parallel ( @xmath90 ) , or perpendicular ( @xmath91 ) to the horizontal axis @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "first we consider the case @xmath93 , where the two fixed points @xmath94 and @xmath95 exist . since the potential energy @xmath60 [ cf .",
    "( [ potdark0 ] ) ] is decreasing , the maxima ( minima ) @xmath96 [ @xmath97 are in different and decreasing energy levels , with every minimum lying between two maxima .",
    "therefore , in the hamiltonian case , @xmath70 , the conditions for the existence of homoclinic orbits ( cf .",
    "lemma 14.3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are satisfied ; thus , at the energy levels of the maxima @xmath96 of @xmath60 , and in the direction of increasing energy , correspond to homoclinic orbits on the saddles @xmath98 , surrounding the centers @xmath99 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath100 and @xmath101 , the stable and the unstable manifold of @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "we may perform a nullcline analysis in the rectangular region @xmath103 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are arbitrary horizontal lines , below and above the homoclinic orbit of @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "this analysis shows that the non - homoclinic branch of @xmath101 escapes from @xmath106 and becomes unbounded . on the other hand , in the hamiltonian case @xmath70 ,",
    "the orbits are symmetric with respect to the horizontal axis @xmath92 .",
    "the symmetric orbit of the unbounded branch of @xmath101 is the non - homoclinic branch of @xmath100 , which enters in the region @xmath106 , by crossing @xmath107 from below .",
    "the transition from @xmath70 to finite @xmath108 , can be analyzed with the help of the hopf bifurcation theorem and the poincar - bendixson theorem .",
    "the former , establishes the non - existence of periodic orbits bifurcating from the unstable spiral @xmath75 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , while the two conditions of the theorem concerning the eigenvalues are satisfied , the third one concerning the degeneracy condition is not ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "besides , the nullcline analysis in region @xmath106 shows that , apart from the stable manifold @xmath100 , all orbits escape form the strip @xmath109 , and there is not any other closed orbit in the strip . since a periodic orbit does not exist",
    ", one may apply the poincar - bendixson theorem on the invariant manifold @xmath100 .",
    "this way , we can establish that each branch lying in the half - plane @xmath110 joins the unstable spiral @xmath102 .",
    "the situation is more intriguing for the branch of @xmath100 lying in the half - plane @xmath111 , since two possibilities exist regarding its connection to a fixed point .",
    "these possibilities depend on the size of @xmath112 , and on the fact , that the transition from @xmath70 to finite @xmath51 is a homoclinic bifurcation for the saddle @xmath102 , where each homoclinic orbit for @xmath70 breaks . when @xmath113 is sufficiently small , a nullcline analysis for @xmath114 , shows that the gradient of the branch @xmath100 lying in the half - plane @xmath111 is close to that of its analogue for @xmath70 ; furthermore , for @xmath114 , the spiraling growth is weak .",
    "therefore , since the branch of @xmath100 lying in the half - plane @xmath110 is connected to the spiral point @xmath75 , the other branch of @xmath100 lying in the half - plane @xmath111 , is the one that connects to the saddle point @xmath115 in the second period of the effective potential @xmath116 . hence , for small values of @xmath113 , the homoclinic bifurcation creates a saddle connection ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) between @xmath102 and @xmath115 . in this connection ,",
    "the branch of @xmath100 lying in the half - plane @xmath111 is  simultaneously  the branch of the unstable manifold @xmath117 lying also in the half - plane @xmath111 .",
    "when @xmath113 is further increased , the branch of @xmath100 lying in the half - plane @xmath111 , connects to the unstable spiral point @xmath118 in the second period of the effective potential .",
    "thus , another type of bifurcation occurs , when @xmath113 exceeds a threshold value @xmath119 , namely , a _",
    "saddle connection breaking bifurcation_. the existence of @xmath120 is guaranteed by the fact that as @xmath121 is increased , the growth and oscillation frequency of the spiraling orbit far from the equilibrium @xmath102 dominates , enforcing the considered branch of @xmath100 to form the shape of the spiral .",
    "furthermore , in the regime @xmath122 , both branches of @xmath101 become unbounded .",
    "when the bifurcation for @xmath123 occurs , the situation is exactly as in the saddle connection breaking setting , with the difference that the unstable spirals are replaced by the unstable nodes , and the orbits are escaping ( converge ) from the strip @xmath109 ( on the stable manifolds ) at an exponential rate .",
    "we conclude with the case @xmath124 , where solely one fixed point @xmath125 exists , and the case where no - fixed points exist . for the former , which is a case of _ saddle - node bifurcation _ , the nullcline analysis in a small neighborhood of @xmath125 reveals that it is unstable . for the latter",
