    "in order to construct devices that reliably process quantum information it is necessary to characterize , measure and eventually remove all the known sources of detrimental noise  @xcite .",
    "it is however inevitable that a certain amount of disturbance will continue to affect the apparatus .",
    "hence it usually will be indispensable to perform quantum error correction ( qec )  @xcite to reduce the error rate to a tolerable amount .",
    "robust and scalable architectures for quantum information processing require that their elementary building blocks are readily calibrated and easily operated .",
    "better scalability with less manual intervention can be achieved by engineering devices which are capable of autonomously characterizing and correcting the error sources .",
    "also , since these systems will likely become increasingly more integrated and miniaturized  @xcite , it will be difficult to have physical access to their building parts once the apparatus has been assembled .",
    "therefore , it is desirable that these devices are designed and built so that it is possible to gather data while the machine is running , and thus , on - the - fly , achieve good control and feedback on the internal functioning .    in this paper we introduce a method that allows for an automated analysis of the presence of error sources and envision an _ agent _ , connected to the quantum device , which performs classical statistical analysis of the data in order to learn which noise processes are occurring on all qubits",
    ". a related case study of adapting to a unitary channel acting on an isolated qubit is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . furthermore , as we argued before , the device will necessarily be equipped with a qec code to protect the logical subspace from noise .",
    "hence we set out to investigate the following natural question : _ to what extent is it possible to characterize the error sources affecting the apparatus , having access to the syndrome measurements alone ? _",
    "more specifically , we examine the scenario in which the agent collects the syndrome measurements and performs statistical analysis over them to detect and characterize a unitary component in the noise .",
    "therefore we avoid the necessity of adding additional sensors to monitor the performance of the quantum processing device .",
    "this approach is independent of the physical implementation of the apparatus and it can be studied through a multitude of different methods , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "once the unitary component of the error has been characterized it is possible , at least in principle , to completely correct it through the application of a counter - unitary operation , which undoes the effect of this component of the error channel . as an alternative",
    ", we might allow the quantum computation to take place in a `` floating frame of reference '' , in which the logical quantum basis change in time in order to compensate for the rotation created by the unitary error channel .",
    "hereafter we will study the information that can be recovered from the most restrictive type of qec .",
    "we consider the extreme case of a qec code in which only one state is protected , i.e. , the logical subspace has dimension one .",
    "this qec method can be adopted to produce the resource state for measurement - based quantum computation ( mbqc )  @xcite . in mbqc",
    "particular classes of quantum states , e.g.  the _ cluster states _",
    "@xcite , are _ universal _ , meaning that they can be employed to perform arbitrary quantum computations just by applying local measurements .",
    "the cluster states are a subset of a more general family of quantum states associated to undirected graphs , which are called _",
    "graph states_. a method for obtaining any graph state consists in measuring a complete set of stabilizer operators ( a.k.a .",
    "_ correlators _ ) and in applying the required corrections whenever an `` error '' is detected .",
    "the output of this procedure is a unique quantum state , i.e.  the required graph state .",
    "another setting in which this qec can be employed is for measurement - based quantum repeaters  @xcite , in which specific graph states are used as resources to perform entanglement purification and entanglement swapping to transmit quantum information over long distances .",

    "[ sec : notation ] we give a brief introduction to graph states and set the notation ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : error_model ] we describe and motivate the error model we analyse in the paper ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : reconstruction ] we detail the effect of the unitary error channel over the stabilizer measurements statistics ; then in sec .",

    "a _ graph state _ @xmath3 is quantum state associated with an _ undirected graph _ @xmath4",
    "having _ vertices _ @xmath5 and _ edges _ @xmath6 , which connect pairs of vertices ; @xmath3 is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the number of qubits of the graph state ( each vertex represents a qubit ) and @xmath10 denotes the ( symmetric ) controlled-@xmath11 operation between the qubits at vertex @xmath12 and @xmath13 . the _ neighbours _ of any vertex @xmath14 are given by the vertices in the set @xmath15 .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath16 .",
    "we say that two graph states are _ locally unitarily equivalent _",
    "( @xmath17-equivalent ) if it is possible to obtain one graph state from the other by applying unitary operations acting on individual qubits .",
    "a standard method that allows us to preserve the coherence of a graph state @xmath3 consists in repeatedly measuring the _ correlator _ operators @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "here @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the pauli matrices acting on the qubit in vertex @xmath12 ; we also use the shorthand @xmath23 .",
    "all these correlators commute pairwise  thus all the measurements can be performed simultaneously  and form a complete set of observables .",
    "we explicitly distinguish the _ correlator _ operators @xmath24 from the random variables @xmath25 which represent the _ realized measurement outcomes _ of @xmath24 .",
    "the variables @xmath25 assume values @xmath26 , corresponding respectively to the @xmath27 eigenvalues of @xmath24 .",
    "the graph state @xmath3 is the unique common eigenvector with eigenvalue equal to @xmath28 for all the correlators ; equivalently , this is the state one obtains when @xmath29 , @xmath19 .",
    "hence , when the measurements outcomes of the correlators are given by @xmath30 , the system is projected into the state @xmath31 where , for any quantum gate @xmath32 , @xmath33 when @xmath29 and @xmath34 when @xmath35",
    ". the graph state @xmath36 is equivalent to @xmath3 for the purpose of performing mbqc .",
    "the pauli errors @xmath22 can be accounted for by a redefinition of the logical encoding of the qubits : i.e. , when @xmath35 , the sign of the state @xmath37 has to be reversed ( that is , we make the association @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) . thus we can assume , without loss of generality , that the graph state is re - prepared after the measurement of all the correlators in the standard graph state @xmath3 . as stated in the introduction , from a quantum error correction perspective",
    "these correlators provide a stabilizer code which protects only one word , the state @xmath3 .    for a thorough introduction to these concepts ,",
    "see ref .",
    "we consider the following model for a unitary error source that acts on a graph state .",
    "suppose that our graph state is physically implemented with spin-@xmath40 particles , each representing a qubit with the spin degree of freedom .",
    "particles might be effectively implemented as neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices , or as ion in a confining potential .",
    "however these real systems are more complex than the model we study in this paper .",
    "for example , the qubits are usually encoded within two energy levels of the atom or ion , and not directly in the angular momentum degrees of freedom of the particle . ]",
    "these particles carry an intrinsic magnetic dipole moment ; hence they are susceptible to undergo larmor precession when immersed in a magnetic field , with angular frequency equal to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the magnetic field intensity and @xmath43 is the gyro - magnetic ratio of the particle .",
    "however , as long as these stray fields are not subject to rapid and stochastic variations in time , it is possible to measure them and then apply a counter - unitary operation which undoes the unwanted precession .",
    "equivalently , if the precession rate of each particle is known , we may let the logical encoding of the qubits become time - dependent , in order to compensate at the logical level the physical precession of the spins of the system .",
    "notice that we focus on unitary processes since , if the error channel is given by a general master equation , the decoherence process can be characterized and mitigated , but not completely corrected .    in summary",
    ", we assume that our graph state @xmath3 is affected by a space - varying static _ stray field _ which has a different strength at each qubit of the state .",
    "we further assume that all measurements are performed at discrete time steps @xmath44 , so that the action of the field on each qubit is given by a @xmath45 operation of the form @xmath46 .",
    "we remark that the results we will obtain in this paper will not depend on the specific implementation of the physical qubits , nor on the physical model of the error source ; our methods will be applicable whenever the error process acting on the qubits is dominated by a unitary local operation acting on the qubits in the system . nonetheless , for concreteness we will always refer to the above specified physical error model .",
    "consequently the word _",
    "field _ can be assumed to designate any channel acting on single qubits and which is given by a fixed , but unknown , unitary mapping .",
    "notice that in the special case where the stray field is almost uniform and acts equally on all the qubits in the graph state , then an efficient way to achieve noise resilience is given by encoding the information in decoherence - free subspaces .",
    "the properties of these subspaces have been extensively studied elsewhere ( see for a review refs .",
    "@xcite ) and thus we will not discuss nor employ them in our work .    in conclusion , at each time step  and on each vertex of the graph ",
    "the qubits are affected by the following local operations : @xmath47 where @xmath14 denotes the site at which the field acts , @xmath48 is proportional to the strengths of the field ( in our physical model @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 ( with @xmath51 ) is the normalized vector in @xmath52 that gives the axis around which the rotation is performed . observe that the relation @xmath51 allows us to recover @xmath53 from @xmath54 , assuming that its sign is always @xmath28 , since this can be enforced by the transformation @xmath55 , which is the identity on @xmath56 .",
    "naturally , in any realistic scenario there will be also other uncharted error sources that act on the physical system , causing some decoherence in the system .",
    "this further noise will in general render the reconstruction of the fields more difficult , but it will not qualitatively affect our results .",
    "in our setting , we are considering a qec scheme which aims to preserve the coherence of the graph state by performing the necessary correlator measurements and reading out the corresponding results .",
    "thus , the whole process can be schematized as follows : the graph state is prepared in the standard reference state @xmath3 ; we wait for a fixed time @xmath44 , during which the error channels act on the physical qubits ; then we measure the correlators , which project the graph state on some state @xmath36 , which depends on the measurement outcomes of the correlators ( i.e.  on the _ measured syndromes _ ) ; we finally use the syndromes to bring back @xmath36 into the reference state @xmath3 , either physically or by changing the logical encoding of the physical qubits .",
    "implicitly , we are assuming that the state preparation , correlator readout and the final correction can be done very fast , w.r.t .",
    "the waiting time @xmath44 , and almost free of errors .",
    "moreover we will assume for the moment that the stray field is the only error source present , i.e. , no other error channel or decoherence process is acting on the qubits .",
    "we will lift this assumption in sec .",
    "[ sec : full_error_analysis ] , where we will consider the effect of having a decoherence channel acting alongside the stray field .",
    "as a first step in our analysis , we need to find the probability that , for each vertex @xmath14 , the measurement outcome @xmath25 of the correlator @xmath24 is equal to @xmath57 or @xmath58 , given that the graph state was initialized in a state @xmath3 corresponding to a graph @xmath59 , and assuming that a unitary @xmath60 has acted on each vertex . the result can be found via a straightforward computation , given in appendix  [ app : error_probability ] .",
    "we define the _ probability difference _ @xmath61",
    "$ ] as the difference between the probability of getting a `` correct '' outcome ( @xmath29 ) and the probability of getting an `` error detected '' outcome ( @xmath35 ) @xmath62 then we obtain the following formula for @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the parameters that define the action of the field on vertex @xmath12 as given by eq .  .",
    "notice that from the probability differences alone it is impossible to reconstruct the correct sign of @xmath67 and @xmath68 , as eq .",
    "depends on these only through @xmath69 , nor the correct value of @xmath70 in the set @xmath71 , since we can only access @xmath72 .    in principle , these ambiguities can be easily resolved .",
    "for example , it is sufficient to vary the delay time @xmath44 to linearly vary the parameters @xmath70 , which can then be discriminated through the functions @xmath73 .",
    "however , these methods rely on performing some extra operations , not included in the basic stabilizer code , and therefore we will not consider them in the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : repeaters ] we will exploit another resource , which is automatically included in mbqc , in order to reconstruct the fields .",
    "that is , we will use that some graph states are @xmath17-equivalent even if they correspond to different graphs .",
    "@xmath17-equivalent graph states have the same power for performing mbqc , assuming that arbitrary local measurements can be performed on the qubits ; nonetheless the information that can be recovered from stabilizer measurements is very different .",
    "hence arises the possibility of exploiting different graph states with equivalent computational power in order to better characterize the error sources .",
    "the problem as specified so far is underdetermined , since we need to determine @xmath74 parameters , i.e.  the field directions and intensities , from just @xmath75 parameters , i.e.  from the measured probability differences .",
    "thus we need to modify the problem to make it possible to reconstruct the stray fields .",
    "we will therefore first consider simplified settings , in which the fields fulfill a condition ( a _ promise _ ) that reduce the number of parameters to be estimated from @xmath74 to @xmath75  thus permitting to estimate them through the measurement of the correlators stabilizing the graph state .",
    "we will then consider a different scenario in sec .",
    "[ sec : extension ] , where we will extend the set of stabilizer measurements in order to collect information on all the @xmath74 parameters .",
    "from now on , we will assume that the field is always globally pointing in a known and well - determined direction , but has unknown site - dependent intensity .",
    "specifically , we investigate the cases in which the field are parallel to one of the cartesian axes ; under these assumptions , eq .   simplifies considerably :    1 .   *",
    "z - field * @xmath76 $ ] + the field is always aligned in the @xmath2 direction @xmath77 2 .",
    "* x - field * @xmath78 $ ] + the field is always aligned in the @xmath0 direction @xmath79 3 .",
    "* y - field * @xmath80 $ ] + the field is always aligned in the @xmath1 direction @xmath81",
    "here we will present a method that allows us to infer the stray fields , knowing the probability differences @xmath82 , in the promise settings specified above .",
    "we will show that not in all circumstances it is possible to determine all field intensities @xmath83 , and this impossibility depends non - trivially on the connectivity structure of the graph state .    to determine the fields we need to solve a system of @xmath75 polynomial equations ( one for each @xmath63 ) in @xmath75 variables ( one for each field intensity @xmath83 ) of degree at most @xmath84 , where @xmath84 is the maximum number of neighbours of any vertex in the graph .",
    "in general , a system of polynomial equations can be solved via computation of the grbner basis associated to the polynomials . there",
    "exist well - known algorithms that compute grbner bases  @xcite , but the time complexity in the worst case scenario grows doubly - exponentially in @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "however , with the method that we will introduce the particular polynomial equations arising from eqs .   can be solved efficiently .",
    "notice in particular that the case of eq .",
    "is already trivially solved , as one reads out directly the ( cosine of the ) intensity of the field from the measured rates .",
    "the other two cases , eqs .  , will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "consider the settings in which the stray field is parallel to either the @xmath2 , @xmath0 or @xmath1 axis .",
    "we can write eqs .",
    "as @xmath85 with @xmath86 , and setting @xmath87 for the @xmath11-field case , @xmath88 for the @xmath89-field case , and @xmath90 for the @xmath91-field case .",
    "they are polynomial equations in the variables @xmath83 , in which each polynomial has only two terms , i.e. , the monomials appearing on the left hand and on the right hand side .",
    "to solve these we take the logarithms of both sides of the equations .    in general",
    "the cosines of the fields ( @xmath83 ) and the probability differences ( @xmath63 ) have support in the interval @xmath92 $ ] .",
    "thus we have to use the logarithm as a complex - valued function ; more precisely , we define the logarithm as taking values on the riemann surface @xmath93 : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the real logarithm ( mapping @xmath96 in @xmath97 ) , @xmath98 and the riemann surface @xmath93 is the complex plane modulo identification of numbers that differ by an integer multiple of @xmath99 ; we also denote by @xmath100[0pt]{$\\scriptstyle 2\\pi i$}}}{=}}$ ] the equality on this riemann surface .",
    "if we restrict @xmath101 to be a real number , then @xmath102 is in the set @xmath103 . with this definition",

    "however , in this context even when @xmath112 is non - singular it is not formally correct to write the solution as @xmath119 , since the system @xmath116[0pt]{$\\scriptstyle 2\\pi i$}}}{=}}\\boldsymbol{w}$ ] can have multiple solutions .",
    "this happens because the entries of @xmath112 are taken as elements of @xmath93 , thus divisions by integer number have to be performed according to eq .  .",
    "therefore , in order recover all the valid solutions to the linear system   we need to employ eq .   whenever performing a division during the solving algorithm .",
    "we adopt a modified version of gauss elimination algorithm which allows us to recover these multiple solutions .",
    "since the entries of @xmath112 are all integers , it is possible to bring @xmath112 into the form of an upper triangular matrix @xmath120 , applying only a sequence of the following _ elementary gauss operations _ on @xmath112 :    rule 1 : :    multiply a row of @xmath112 by @xmath121 ; rule 2 : :    permute two rows of @xmath112 ; rule 3 : :    add to the @xmath122-th row of @xmath112 an integer    multiple of the @xmath123-th row , with @xmath124 .",

    "equivalently , we might consider the case in which the stray fields @xmath229 are not fixed vectors , but they vary in time . if these temporal variations are fast and stochastic , then it can be imagined that @xmath229 are random variables drawn according to some probability distribution .    the simplest model , but also the worst case scenario , for this source of incoherent noise is given by the uniformly depolarizing channel @xmath230 where @xmath231 is a single qubit density matrix and @xmath232 .",
    "it is not necessary to specify in which order the depolarizing channel and the local unitary rotations are applied , since they commute . from eq .",

    "we point out that , for the @xmath89 or @xmath91-field cases , for some of the qubits in the graph state the reconstruction algorithm may exhibit a natural resilience to the inaccuracy introduced by the uniformly depolarizing noise .",
    "in fact , from the expression in eq .   it can be seen that , to account for the action of the depolarizing noise , the differences in probabilities have to be multiplied by @xmath235 for all qubits . thus the vector @xmath236 has to be added to the known term in the linear equation  , whose entries are the logarithm of the differences in probabilities . by linearity",
    ", the effect of the depolarizing noise on @xmath152 ( the vector of the estimators in logarithmic variables ) is simply given by the addition of @xmath237 .",
    "some of the entries of the vector @xmath238 might be zero , implying that the reconstruction of the fields for those entries is unaffected by the depolarizing noise .",
    "we have tested through numerical simulation the performance of our reconstruction method when all the three noise factors considered above are present , i.e. , the effect of the _ finiteness _ of the number of measurements of the correlators , the _ misalignment _ of the field from the promised direction , and the independent action of a _ depolarizing channel _ on the qubits .",
    "these simulations provide evidence that , indeed , when all the noise factors are small ( and the numbers of measurements of each correlator is large ) then the accuracy in the reconstruction improves and , in principle , the inaccuracy can be brought arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "we define the _ reconstruction error _",
    "@xmath239 on any vertex @xmath14 as @xmath240 in which @xmath241 is the true value of parameter and @xmath242 is a regularization of the output @xmath243 of the reconstruction algorithm .",
    "the regularization consists in setting @xmath244 when @xmath245 and @xmath246 when @xmath247 , so that the regularized value always lies in the interval @xmath160 $ ] .",
    "an excerpt of the _ reconstruction errors _ we have obtained , in the case of an open - ended chain with ten vertices , is given in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "a general trend that can be inferred from the numerical data is that  since the correlation among the parameters is not taken into account ",
    "the reconstruction error is minimal in the @xmath11-field case , is larger in the @xmath89-field case , and is still larger in the @xmath91-field case .",
    "this feature is expected , since the degree of the polynomial equations to be solved is minimal in the @xmath11-field case , larger in the @xmath89-field case and still larger in the @xmath91-field case .",
    "this implies that the cross - correlations between the estimators of the fields are maximal in the @xmath91-field case and they are minimal in the @xmath11-field case .",
    "another feature that can be inferred from the data is that the precision of the estimation of the fields varies across the vertices of the graph and depends on the global connectivity of the graph itself .",
    "notice that to produce the data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we have assumed that the model of the disturbance is the same for all ten vertices in the chain . thus for symmetry reasons we expect that , averaging over all possible intensities of the stray field , for a open - ended chain with ten qubits the inaccuracy in the reconstruction of the fields on vertex @xmath12 and @xmath248 are the same .    also , notice that the reconstruction error decreases approximately as @xmath249 for small values of @xmath250 , while for larger values of @xmath250 the reconstruction error approaches a non - zero asymptotic value , which is due to residual uncertainties introduced by the depolarizing noise and stray field misalignment .",
    "finally , we remark that at some of the vertices the reconstruction of the fields shows resilience to the depolarizing noise , for the reason given earlier .",
    "explicitly , this happens for qubits on the vertices @xmath251 for the @xmath89-field case and for qubits on the vertices @xmath252 for the @xmath91-field case , as can be easily checked computing @xmath238 for these two cases .",
    "consequently , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that these qubits are almost insensitive to the magnitude @xmath253 of the depolarizing noise , provided that @xmath254 .",
    "when @xmath255 , then the effect of the finiteness of the number of measurement @xmath250 renders unreliable the reconstruction of the fields on those qubits .",
    "a completely different approach to estimating the stray fields consists in adopting different sets of stabilizer measurements in order to collect more information . in this way",
    "we do not need to assume that the fields are always aligned in a known direction .",
    "using a different set of stabilizer measurements will produce a different graph state ; but this is not an issue , as long as the functionality of this family of graph states is the same of that of the reference graph state .",
    "explicitly , we consider the following scenario . in the defining equation  , the correlators are defined in terms of the product of pauli-@xmath89 and pauli-@xmath11 matrices .",
    "actually , many other correlators will yield graph states which have the same computational capabilities as the reference graph state . for example",
    ", we could as well use correlators in the form @xmath256 ( or in the form @xmath257 ) . to see that these stabilizers define a graph state which is computationally equivalent to the original one it is enough to observe that these are obtained by a redefinition of the pauli matrices , @xmath258 ( or @xmath259 ) , which is a transformation that preserves the commutation relations between the matrices  and thus all the associated algebraic properties .",
    "correspondingly , the local measurements necessary to perform mbqc have to be modified according to the new pauli basis .",
    "these considerations apply to any transformation @xmath260 , in which @xmath261 is any right - oriented orthonormal basis of @xmath52 .",
    "we call these _ logical pauli matrices_. correspondingly , eq .   becomes : @xmath262 thus , using three different graph states , associated to three different logical pauli bases it is in principle possible to reconstruct all the parameters of the stray fields .",
    "notice that in general there will be many physically acceptable solutions to a system of @xmath74 polynomial equations with @xmath74 unknowns .",
    "but then using @xmath263 logical pauli bases , from the corresponding graph states one obtains an overdetermined system of @xmath264 equations with @xmath74 unknowns , which almost certainly admits only one solution ; moreover , having more independent equations usually provides a reconstruction which is more robust in presence of small uncertainties . explicitly , we look for an approximate solution to the equations through numerical minimization of the following cost function : @xmath265 here @xmath266 is computed from eq .   and it is a function of the field intensities @xmath267 and directions @xmath268 at the vertices in @xmath269 , and of the choice of the logical pauli basis  @xmath270 ( which can be identified with an orthonormal basis in @xmath52 ) . with @xmath271",
    "we denote the value for the probability difference estimated from syndrome measurements for vertex @xmath12 using the logical pauli basis  @xmath270 .",
    "an example of the result that can be obtained via this method is reported in fig .",
    "in this paper we have shown how to use the information collected from a set of stabilizer measurements in order to extract information about a unitary error process acting on a graph state .",
    "since the stabilizer measurements are non - local operations , each of them depends on the errors that act on several different sites of the graph state .",
    "therefore the measurement outcomes of these stabilizers are correlated .",
    "we have studied in depth the case in which the local unitary errors are given by rotations aligned to one of the cartesian axes .",
    "this condition is needed to make the problem solvable , i.e. , we match the number of parameters to be reconstructed to the number of measured parameters ; moreover this restriction allows us to find efficient reconstruction methods .    a surprising result arising from the fact that the stabilizer measurement outcomes are correlated is that in some circumstances it is not possible to reconstruct all the parameters of the unitary error  even under the assumption that we can measure the stabilizers an arbitrary number of times .",
    "the possibility of completely reconstructing the error turns out to depend non - trivially on the connectivity structure of the graph state .",
    "specifically , in order to determine the intensity of local unitary rotations around the @xmath0 axis , the adjacency matrix @xmath109 associated to a graph state @xmath110 has to be a full - rank matrix , whereas to reconstruct rotations around the @xmath1 axis the matrix @xmath272 has to be full - rank , while rotations around the @xmath2 axis can always be reconstructed .    we have ascertained for some classes of graph states whether it is possible to reconstruct all the errors . hence we have studied the properties of the adjacency matrices of _ linear chains _ ( with open and closed boundary conditions ) , _ square lattices _ in arbitrary number of dimensions , and ghz states ( these represented either as _ fully - connected _ graphs or as _ star _ graphs ) .",
    "finally we have shown that the performed reconstruction is resistant to various kinds of imperfections .",
    "in particular we have investigated the effect of a finite number of measurements of stabilizers , of the misalignment of the rotation axis and of the action of a depolarizing noise alongside the action of the unitary channel . in each of these cases , as long as the imperfections are small , the precision in the determination of the unitary channel is only mildly affected .",
    "we acknowledge support from the austrian science fund ( fwf ) through the sfb foqus : f4012 , and the templeton world charity foundation grant twcf0078/ab46 .",
    "in this appendix we derive eq .  .",
    "this equation gives the difference between the probability of getting @xmath273 and @xmath274 when measuring the correlator @xmath275 on a graph state which is subject to local noise of the form @xmath276 .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath277 ; observe that @xmath24 has spectrum @xmath27 , therefore there is a unitary mapping @xmath278 such that @xmath279 , where @xmath280 with @xmath281 is the projector on the @xmath282-eigenspace of @xmath24 .",
    "hence we get that the difference in the probabilities is given by the expectation value of @xmath24 on @xmath283 : @xmath284 now we can compute : @xmath285        \\left(x_a \\bigotimes_{b \\in \\mathcal{n}_a } z_b \\right )        { | g \\rangle } \\nonumber\\\\    & = \\left[\\prod_{c \\in ( v \\setminus \\mathcal{n}_a ' ) } e^{-i \\lambda_c \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_c \\cdot \\boldsymbol{s}_c/2 } \\right ] \\cdot \\nonumber\\\\    & \\ \\cdot \\left (                e^{-i \\frac{\\lambda_a}{2 } \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_a \\cdot ( x_a \\boldsymbol{s}_a x_a ) }              \\prod_{b \\in \\mathcal{n}_a }               e^{-i \\frac{\\lambda_b}{2 } \\hat{\\boldsymbol{n}}_b \\cdot ( z_b \\boldsymbol{s}_b z_b ) }              \\right )             { | g \\rangle}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath286 , and in which we have used that @xmath287 and that @xmath288 when @xmath32 is a unitary operator .",

    "<S> in the context of measurement - based quantum computation a way of maintaining the coherence of a _ graph state _ is to measure its stabilizer operators . aside from performing quantum error correction , it is possible to exploit the information gained from these measurements to characterize and then counteract a coherent source of errors ; that is , to determine all the parameters of an _ error channel _ that applies a fixed  but unknown  unitary operation to the physical qubits . </S>",
    "<S> such a channel is generated , e.g. , by local stray fields that act on the qubits . </S>",
    "<S> we study the case in which each qubit of a given _ graph state _ may see a different error channel and we focus on channels given by a rotation on the bloch sphere around either the @xmath0 , @xmath1 or @xmath2 axis , for which analytical results can be given in a compact form . </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of reconstructing the channels at all qubits depends non - trivially on the topology of the graph state . </S>",
    "<S> we prove via perturbation methods that the reconstruction process is robust and supplement the analytic results with numerical evidence . </S>"
