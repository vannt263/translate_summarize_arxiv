    "the bridge index and superbridge index of a knot are important invariants in knot theory .",
    "they are defined as the minimum and maximum number of local maxima respectively in the projection of a conformation of a knot onto an axis , minimized over all conformations of the knot .",
    "the bridge index was introduced by schubert  @xcite in  1954 to study companionship in satellite knots .",
    "the superbridge index was introduced by kuiper  @xcite in  1987 , and has proven to be a useful invariant in obtaining lower bounds on the stick number of knots , which is defined as the least number of straight line segments needed to be placed end - to - end to form the knot in space .",
    "for example , jin  @xcite used the superbridge index to prove that the stick number of the @xmath0-torus knot  @xmath1 is equal to @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "for a fixed embedding  @xmath4 of a knot into @xmath5 and any choice of axis , we can count the number of stationary points in the projection of the knot onto that axis .",
    "this allows us to define a map on the unit sphere , the bridge map of the knot conformation  @xmath4 , by assigning to each vector @xmath6 one half of the number of stationary points in the projection of the knot onto the axis defined by  @xmath7 .",
    "the bridge index is then just one half of the minimum value of the bridge map , minimized over all conformations of the knot .",
    "the superbridge index is one half the maximum value of the bridge map , minimized over all conformations of the knot .    in this paper",
    ", we study the graph of the bridge map , the ( minimal ) set of points in  @xmath8 that separates the sphere into open regions on which the bridge map is constant . by interpreting the bridge map in terms of intersections of the tangent indicatrix of @xmath4 with great circles and using the concepts of dual and derivative curves",
    "as introduced by arnold  @xcite in the study of the geometry of spherical curves , we show that the bridge graph is the union of the binormal indicatrix of the knot conformation with its antipodal curve and a number of great circles .",
    "we also define another map on  @xmath8 , the inflection map of the knot conformation  @xmath4 , which counts the number of inflection points and cusps in planar projections of  @xmath4 , and show that its graph is the union of the tangent indicatrix of the knot conformation with its antipodal curve and a number of great circles .",
    "this duality relationship is studied for another dual pair of curves , the normal and darboux indicatrices of a knot conformation .",

    "however , some care must be taken at cusps of the tantrix : when do we count a cusp of the tantrix as contributing to a stationary point in height to the tantrix - bridge map ? returning to our interpretation of the tantrix - bridge map as the number of intersections of the notrix with a great circle , we see we want the derivative of the tantrix to lie in the plane of that great circle , and hence a cusp of the tantrix should be counted as a stationary point in height only if the derivative at that point is perpendicular to the height axis .",
    "similar arguments show that the only cusps that should contribute to an inflection point or cusp in the tantrix - inflection map are those that lie on the great circle in the projection .    in the following two theorems ,",
    "we determine the bridge graph , the inflection graph , the tantrix - bridge graph and the tantrix - inflection graph for smooth knots .",

    "there are three types of intersections of the tantrix with a great circle , in the vicinity of which the number of intersections of the tantrix with a great circle may change : ( i ) the great circle is tangential to the tantrix neither at a spherical inflection point of the tantrix nor at a cusp ( fig  [ fig : tantrix_tangential ] ) , ( ii ) the great circle is tangential to the tantrix at a spherical inflection point of the tantrix ( fig  [ fig : tantrix_sphericalinflection ] ) , and ( iii ) the great circle intersects the tantrix at a semi - cubical cusp of the tantrix ( fig  [ fig : tantrix_cusp ] ) .",

    "next , a change in the number of intersections of the tantrix with a great circle in the vicinity of a spherical inflection point of the tantrix corresponds to moving the center of a great circle from outside a cusp of the binotrix to inside ( and similarly for the anti - binotrix ) , or vice versa , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : binotrix_cusp ] , as the limiting tangent at a cusp of the binotrix is obtained from the tangent to the tantrix at a spherical inflection point by moving a distance of  @xmath60 along the normal on the side determined by the co - orientation . finally , the number of intersections of the tantrix with a great circle changes as we move the great circle over a cusp in almost every direction ( by our assumption that no two cusps of the tantrix coincide and a cusp of the tantrix never coincides with a cusp of the anti - tantrix ) .",
    "hence the portion of the bridge graph that such intersections contribute to are great circles whose centers are at those cusps , and which are therefore great circles tangent to the binotrix and anti - binotrix at points corresponding to @xmath21-inflection points of the knot .",
    "the proof of the second statement follows analogously upon noting that cusps in the binotrix correspond to @xmath22-inflection points of the knot .    in fact",

    "the change in value of the bridge map as we move across a great circle defining the bridge graph can be determined from the shape of the binotrix near a @xmath21-inflection point .",

    "we believe that for any stick knot  @xmath4 , it is possible to use the methods in a paper by wu  @xcite to show that there exists a smooth knot @xmath195 with the same knot type such that the maps defined by the various indicatrices of  @xmath195 are combinatorially the same as those of @xmath4 , that is , there exists an isotopy of  @xmath8 that sends a map on  @xmath195 to that on  @xmath4 ( note that we do not require the same isotopy for all maps ) . this would enable us to obtain bounds on the stick number of knots by studying the maps defined by the various indicatrices for smooth knots . also ,",
    "since each arc of the darboux indicatrix of a stick knot connects a vertex of the tantrix to a vertex of the binotrix and thus has length  @xmath60 , the total length of the darboux indicatrix of  @xmath4 is  @xmath196",
    ". it would be interesting to see if one could relate the length of the darboux indicatrix of a stick knot to the length of the darboux indicatrix of smooth knot conformations of the same knot type , as this would also enable us to obtain bounds on the stick number of knots by studying their darboux indicatrices .",
    "observe that the bridge index and superbridge index of a knot can always be realized in smooth conformations with non - vanishing curvature .",
    "in such a case , the bridge graph is simply the union of the binotrix and the anti - binotrix .",
    "it follows that @xmath197 = b[k ] + 1 $ ] if and only if there exists a knot conformation @xmath198 $ ] such that the binotrix does not intersect itself or the anti - binotrix and this conformation realizes the lowest possible value of the bridge map over all knots @xmath198 $ ] .",
    "this is because at a point where the binotrix intersects itself or the anti - binotrix , there will be two regions adjacent to that point where the value of the bridge map differs by @xmath199 , and hence the superbridge index would be at least two greater than the bridge index .",
    "in particular , jeon and jin  @xcite conjectured that the only knots with superbridge index 3 are the trefoil knot and the figure eight knot .",
    "this conjecture would be proved if it could be shown that the trefoil knot and the figure eight knot are the only non - trivial knots with conformations such that the binotrix does not intersect itself or the anti - binotrix and the bridge map realizes a value of @xmath199 in such a conformation ."
