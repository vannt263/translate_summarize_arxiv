    "it is known that statistical mechanics of point vortices describes surprisingly well the averaged velocity profiles of self - similar mixing layer .",
    "after development of statistical mechanics of vortex lines rf1,rf2,rf3,rf4,rf5 , where a vortex does not remain straight and is allowed to take wavy shapes in the course of motion , it appeared a concern that the above - mentioned feature of statistical mechanics of point vortices can be lost in three - dimensional theory . in this paper",
    "we show that this is not the case : the averaged velocity profiles predicted by statistical mechanics of point vortices and statistical mechanics of vortex lines are practically indistinguishable for a shear flow between two parallel walls .",
    "consider a flow of ideal incompressible fluid between two parallel walls , @xmath0 is the coordinate normal to the walls , @xmath1 , @xmath2 - the distance between the walls .",
    "the flow is modeled by motion of a large number of vortices ( fig.1 ) .",
    "flow is periodic in @xmath3-direction and @xmath4-direction . in the limit of infinite period in @xmath4-direction ,",
    "the averaged velocity is parallel to the walls , does not depend on @xmath3 and has the only non - zero component , @xmath5 . assuming that vortices have the same intensity and the total discharge is zero , one obtains for the stream function of the averaged flow , @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) , the equation    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the probability to find a vortex at the point @xmath0 , @xmath10 is the total vorticity per unit length in @xmath3-direction , @xmath11 . in the case of point vortices ( fig.1a ) , @xcite @xmath12 and equations ( 1 ) ,",
    "( 2 ) form a closed system of equations .",
    "this system can be solved analytically .",
    "parameter @xmath13 has the meaning of inverse temperature of vortex motion .",
    "it is determined by the initial energy of turbulent flow.in the case of deforming vortex lines ( fig.1b ) , @xmath9 is expressed through the solutions of the eigenvalue problem , @xcite",
    "@xmath14    @xmath15 being the minimum eigenvalue . similarly to quantum mechanics , @xmath16 is proportional to the squared solution of the eigenvalue problem : @xmath17 we aim to compare solutions of ( 1),(2 ) and ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) .",
    "there is no reason to expect that the velocity profiles found from the two quite different system of equations , ( 1)-(2 ) and ( 1),(3),(4 ) , coincide .",
    "nevertheless , this turns out to be the case : the velocity profiles are practically indistinguishable . more precisely : for each @xmath13 from `` @xmath18 problem '' ( 1),(3),(4 ) there is @xmath13 from `` @xmath19 problem '' ( 1)-(2 ) for which the velocity profiles practically coincide .",
    "all parameters of the flow can be normalized with respect to the wall velocity : @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the dimension of the normalized @xmath13 is length@xmath29 . the characteristic length",
    ", @xmath30 is the width of the mixing layer .",
    "non - linear eigenvalue problem ( 1 ) , ( 3),(4 ) was solved numerically using an iteration procedure . at each iteration",
    "step the system is being reduced to the sturm - liouville problem , that was solved with the prfer method ( a shooting method based on oscillation @xcite ) . for a given @xmath31 of vortex line flow ,",
    "@xmath32 one can choose @xmath31 of point vortex flow , @xmath33 in such a way , that the velocity profiles are practically identical .",
    "this can be seen , for example , from fig.2 , where the velocity profiles and the stream function are shown for @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for which the average velocity profiles coincide form a curve in the plane \\{@xmath38 shown in fig.3 .",
    "this curve was found in the following way .",
    "for each @xmath37 we seek @xmath36 by the minimization of the sum@xmath39where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are velocities in @xmath19 and @xmath18 problems , respectively , @xmath42 is the number of the mesh points .",
    "the weight coefficients , @xmath43 depend on the density of the mesh and the gradient of the velocity profile @xmath44 .",
    "the distance between the walls , @xmath45 was chosen large enough for the solution ( 7 ) to be applicable .      the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 have the meaning of the inverse temperature of two - dimensional and three - dimensional motions .",
    "the fact , that the same velocity profile corresponds to different @xmath36 and @xmath37 , indicates that the corresponding temperatures of two - dimensional and three - dimensional motions are different .",
    "the temperature of two - dimensional motion has a simple physical meaning : this is an average area bounded by the vortex trajectory .",
    "the area has orientation .",
    "accordingly , temperature may have both signs",
    ". negative temperature of the flow considered corresponds to clockwise pass of the curls of the vortex trajectories @xcite .",
    "the physical meaning of temperature of three - dimensional vortex line motion is not known , therefore a physical interpretation of the graph @xmath47 is yet to be established .",
    "the result obtained seems an indication that for the shear flow between parallel walls three - dimensionality does not play an important role in formation of the averaged velocity profiles ."
