    "the diagnosis of magnetic fields in astrophysical plasmas relies on the measurement and interpretation of the polarization signature of the magnetic fields in spectral lines .",
    "the physical conditions of these plasmas vary greatly depending on the type of astronomical objects considered . as a consequence a variety of simultaneous , and sometimes competing , effects ",
    "radiative , collisional , and from plasma electric and magnetic fields  need to be taken into consideration in the modeling of the observed radiation .    in dense plasmas , such as",
    "those characteristic of stellar atmospheres , strong gradients of temperature and density , as well as of magnetic and velocity fields , often occur ( e.g. , due to atmosphere stratification under the effect of gravitation and pressure gradients , or because of the presence of convective motions and dynamo actions ) , which need to be taken into account in modeling the transport of polarized radiation through the plasma .",
    "this is certainly the case for the strongest absorption lines of the solar spectrum , giving rise to a great diversity of line profile shapes and degrees of polarization , especially when observed with high temporal and spatial resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* )    besides these non - local , radiative transfer effects , the particular excitation conditions of a magnetized plasma away from local thermodynamic equilibrium often represents a challenging problem for the description of the interaction between matter and polarized radiation . apart from the well - studied zeeman effect , subtle quantum processes associated with the polarized state of the atoms are often at play in stellar atmospheres , such as the hanle effect , or other quantum effects associated with level - crossing physics .",
    "while these processes offer an opportunity for a highly refined diagnostics of magnetized plasmas , they also present theoretical and computational difficulties that have commonly prevented their full exploitation in the astrophysical context .",
    "modeling of partial redistribution of the photon s frequency in the scattering of polarized radiation is perhaps one of the most difficult problems to treat at the fundamental level , as this generally requires to describe the interaction of radiation with matter beyond the lowest order of approximation , which is instead adequate in the case of absorption and emission lines that are formed under conditions of complete frequency redistribution .",
    "for example , when isotropic plasma collisions are effective at destroying the coherence of multi - photon interactions , the scattering of radiation can safely be described as the incoherent succession of single - photon absorption and emission .",
    "it can also be shown that irradiation of the atom by a spectrally flat radiation allows a description of the scattering process that is phenomenologically identical to that provided by such two - step , single - photon processes of absorption and incoherent re - emission ( e.g. , @xcite ,  20 ; see also @xcite ,  2.6 , and section  [ sec : balance ] of this paper ) .",
    "therefore , the regime for which the frequency coherence effects characteristic of radiation scattering are instead important is typically one of low plasma densities ( i.e. , low collisional rates ) and highly spectrally modulated radiation , such as that emerging from stellar atmospheres in correspondence of very deep absorption lines .",
    "this paper introduces a general frequency redistribution function for the polarized two - term atom , and then considers particular cases of it , which are relevant to the investigation of strong resonance lines in the solar spectrum , for which partial redistribution effects are deemed to be important",
    ". however , the results presented here are also valid in the case of subordinate lines , when both the upper and lower terms are radiatively broadened by spontaneous de - excitation .",
    "this study is based on a novel formalism ( * ? ? ?",
    "* work in progress ) that , within the framework of non - relativistic quantum electrodynamics , describes the time evolution of the atomic system and the radiation field in terms of _ propagators_.",
    "this formalism relies on a diagrammatic representation of the atom - photon interaction , which allows to correctly identify and enumerate the types of processes that contribute to the scattering of polarized radiation . at the lowest order of interaction",
    ", it reproduces the theory of polarized line formation for complete redistribution of frequency @xcite .    over the past four decades",
    ", several authors have addressed the problem of partial redistribution in polarized spectral lines .",
    "we will not provide a detailed account of the progress in this area , but we limit ourselves to simply tracing the main lines of work .",
    "notable are the works of @xcite , and of heinzel and collaborators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all of which derive essentially from the seminal work of @xcite , who had extended the impact theory of pressure broadening developed by @xcite ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) to second order , in order to study the line shape of molecular raman scattering .",
    "@xcite assumed the diagonality of the density matrix of the initial ( lower ) state , as did the subsequent works that were based on the same formalism .",
    "this assumption corresponds to the hypothesis of non - coherent lower term ( see sect  [ sec : special ] ) .",
    "more recently , @xcite followed a heuristic approach built upon the kramers - heisenberg scattering amplitude in order to derive a semi - classical theory of partial redistribution , which has enabled the derivation of redistribution functions similar to those presented in this paper ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , again for atoms with non - coherent lower term .",
    "other works have approached the general problem of spectral line formation , investigating frequency redistribution effects in the statistical equilibrium of the atom and in the transport of polarized radiation through an absorptive and scattering medium .",
    "@xcite followed an approach based on @xcite , which allowed for the presence of atomic coherence ( i.e. , non - diagonal density matrix ) in the lower term .",
    "remarkably their work led to results for the scattering redistribution function that are in full agreement with ours .",
    "@xcite investigated the redistribution problem relying on the quantum - regression theorem ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and derived results that agree with those of @xcite .",
    "@xcite extended the first - order theory of polarized line formation of @xcite to include partial redistribution effects in a two - term atom .",
    "this was done by describing the atomic states in terms of energy _",
    "metalevels _ ( or energy _ sub - states _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and proposing a heuristic generalization of the atomic density matrix based upon the `` metalevel '' idea .",
    "their formalism naturally reproduces the results of the first - order theory of polarized line formation , in the limit of complete redistribution ( e.g. , for a flat - spectrum illumination of the atom ) , and it was applied successfully to the problem of the scattering polarization in the d - doublet @xcite . finally , @xcite formally extended the line formation theory of @xcite to higher orders of perturbation , at the same time relying also on the results of @xcite to describe relaxation effects on the atomic system from the interaction with a thermal bath of colliding perturbers .",
    "the redistribution function for the two - level atom with unpolarized lower level derived from that theory was shown to be in agreement with the results of @xcite , and of the heuristic approaches of @xcite and @xcite in the absence of collisions .    in this paper , we introduce in section  [ sec : theory ] some fundamental theoretical results that lie at the basis of our treatment of partial frequency redistribution of polarized radiation . in section  [ sec : special ] we re - derive several special forms of the redistribution function known from the past literature , and also present a generalization of those previous results that allows for atomic coherence in the lower term . in section",
    "[ sec : lifetimes ] we briefly discuss the definition of the radiative lifetimes of atomic states perturbed by the presence of external fields .",
    "this is an important clarification for the applicability of the results here presented .",
    "( as usual , collisional widths can be added to the natural widths of the atomic level in a phenomenological way , in the limit of the impact approximation .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite . ) in section  [ sec : application ] we specialize the equation of radiative transfer with partial redistribution to the general case of a polarized two - term atom with hyperfine structure .",
    "the cases of simpler atomic structures can be obtained from this more general case , and as an illustration we re - derive the expression of the scattering emissivity for the two - term atom with unpolarized lower levels and in the limit of zero magnetic field , which has been derived previously through the metalevel approach @xcite .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : balance ] we verify that the generalized radiative transfer equation with the inclusion of coherent scattering satisfies the fundamental condition that the energy flux of the radiation through a closed surface containing the scatterer must be zero , in the absence of collisions .",
    "we consider a two - term atom with upper levels @xmath0 and lower levels @xmath1 .",
    "these levels represent the energy eigenstates of the atomic hamiltonian in the presence of the external fields . in general , we allow for these levels to be arbitrarily polarized , and therefore we assume the existence of atomic coherence among the levels , described by the ( complex ) non - diagonal elements of the atomic density matrix , such as @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we want to study the scattering of polarized radiation by an ensemble of such atoms , the radiation being described by an arbitrary incident beam of wave vector @xmath4 and polarization state @xmath5 , and an emerging beam of given wave vector @xmath6 and polarization state @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , we want to focus on the _ coherent _ part of the evolution equation of the radiation field , where the upper levels @xmath8 enter only as virtual states .",
    "this part only appears when we push the development of the formal theory to include multi - photon effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we thus find that the equation for the transport of polarized radiation _ for the two - term atom _ , expressed in the atomic reference frame , can be written in the form @xmath9 the first - order terms , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , whose explicit expressions we omit for the moment ( see sect .  [ sec : application ] ) , describe , respectively , the emission of radiation of wave vector @xmath6 and polarization state @xmath7 due to the spontaneous de - excitation of the atom from all possible states @xmath2 , and the absorption rate of the incident radiation propagating _ along the same vector _ @xmath6 ( but in all possible polarization states ) when the atom is in any of the possible states @xmath3 .",
    "we neglect , here and in the following , any contribution of stimulated emission to the expression of @xmath11 .",
    "we make this choice in order to facilitate comparison of our results with those in the former literature on the subject of partial redistribution .",
    "the second - order term @xmath12 describes instead the scattering of radiation by the atom from all possible lower states @xmath3 , via all possible intermediate ( virtual ) levels @xmath8 , and final levels @xmath13 .",
    "thus , the first - order terms in equation  ( [ eq : rt ] ) account for the transfer of radiation along the direction @xmath6 , while the second - order term describes the phenomenon of coherent scattering .",
    "we note that we use here the term `` coherent '' in the broader sense of `` memory preserving '' , rather than in the usual restricted sense of `` frequency preserving '' .",
    "this seems to be a better interpretation in light of the theoretical development that led to equation  ( [ eq : rt ] ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* work in progress ) .",
    "the coherent - scattering term has the following expression , @xmath14 first we note that the sum over @xmath4 actually stands for a continuous integration on both frequency and direction of propagation , so we can operate the usual substitution , which holds in the atomic frame of rest , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the volume of the quantization box .",

    "the supporting theory , which is still work in progress , follows a diagrammatic approach to the derivation of the evolution equation for a general atomic system interacting with a polarized radiation field .",
    "this approach leads to the same perturbation series for the evolution equation of the coupled system atom+radiation as that of @xcite , and the initial conditions for the system s density matrix are also handled in a similar way .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , the fundamental results that we derive separately for the statistical equilibrium of the atomic system and for the transport of polarized radiation do not agree with the work of @xcite , although both approaches lead to the same redistribution function for the two - level atom with unpolarized lower level and in the absence of collisions .",
    "it is worth spending a few words on the notation adopted for the profiles @xmath21 .",
    "the subscripts identify the atomic levels involved in a transition , while the superscripts represent the frequencies of the corresponding emitted ( @xmath29 ) and absorbed ( @xmath30 ) photons .",
    "these profiles originate in our theory from the formal product of a first - order feynman diagram with a second - order diagram .",
    "the two diagrams are distinguished by the comma separators in both the subscript and superscript lists .",
    "the time ordering of these feynman diagrams is from right to left , in the profile s notation .",
    "thus , in equation  ( [ eq : psi ] ) , we read the contribution of a first - order process involving the transition @xmath31 with exchange of a photon @xmath32 , and at the same time the contribution of a second - order process involving the transition @xmath33 with exchange of two photons , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "a pictorial representation of the feynman diagrams for atom - photon interactions up to second order is given in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "in all diagrams , time is flowing upward .",
    "the first - order diagrams ( top row ) account for the processes of single - photon absorption and emission , while the second - order diagrams ( bottom row ) describe the scattering of photons ( first two diagrams ) , as well as two - photon absorption and emission ( last two diagrams ) .",
    "the central diagram in the bottom row represents a typical atomic self - energy insertion , corresponding to the lowest - order radiative correction to the energy of the atomic state .",
    "this diagram is accounted for in the theory by `` dressing '' the atomic propagator , which results in the atomic levels acquiring a finite lifetime because of the possibility of spontaneous de - excitation .",
    "the process of two - photon absorption is the simplest example of non - linear optical effect , and can typically be neglected for highly diluted radiation fields , such as in the case of solar applications .",
    "diagrams of that type give rise to radiation observables that are related to _ second - order coherence _",
    "( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and which we explicitly neglect in our treatment , although the impact of this choice for the inner consistency of the formalism is still to be fully assessed .",
    "we will also ignore the two - photon emission diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] , as this does not contribute significantly to the scattering of radiation in a two - term atom model .",
    "in fact , because of energy conservation , the initial and final states in that diagram , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , must belong respectively to the upper and lower terms of the model atom , and so the intermediate transition through the virtual state @xmath36 is constrained by the set of selection rules that apply to the @xmath24@xmath25 transition .",
    "this typically results in a very low rate for the two - photon emission process .",
    "an instructive example is that of the lyman-@xmath37 transition of hydrogen , between the atomic terms of principal quantum numbers @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the lyman-@xmath37 emission is dominated by the electric - dipole transition from @xmath40 to @xmath41 , with a lifetime @xmath42s .",
    "the transition between @xmath43 and @xmath41 is forbidden to the lowest order of approximation , but it can occur via two - photon emission , corresponding to the last diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] , through a virtual state @xmath36 belonging to a @xmath44 term .",
    "such transition has indeed been observed in the laboratory , and it is responsible for a measurable lifting of the metastability of the @xmath41 state , with a lifetime @xmath45s @xcite .",
    "however , its contribution compared to the dominant term of lyman-@xmath37 is completely negligible for any practical application to the polarized line diagnostics of astrophysical plasmas .    in the general case of a multi - term atom",
    ", there are additional terms that must be considered , which originate from different combinations of feynman diagrams ( involving up to third - order processes , to the degree of approximation of the theory ) .",
    "_ for the two - term atom , and neglecting stimulation effects , the profiles of equation  ( [ eq : psi ] ) are the only ones bringing a contribution to the scattering of polarized radiation .",
    "_ after a rather involved algebraic manipulation , the sum of complex profiles in equation  ( [ eq:2emiss ] ) is shown to be proportional to the following redistribution function , @xmath46 where we introduced the sum of the level widths , @xmath47 , and in the argument list of the function @xmath48 we adopted the shorthand notation @xmath49 , to indicate the complex energy of the level @xmath50 , including its width .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : red.gen ] ) is one of the preliminary results of our theory of partial redistribution with polarization .",
    "another result suggests that , _ in the absence of collisions ( i.e. , at zero temperature ) , the process that populates the upper term by radiative absorption is inhibited in the limit of infinitely sharp lower levels .",
    "_ in this limit , the first - order contribution to the emissivity in equation  ( [ eq : rt ] ) vanishes , and all radiation processes contributing to the emergent radiation depend exclusively on the population distribution and coherence within the lower term .",
    "the self - consistency of this last result has not yet been fully demonstrated , and for this reason we can not provide here a rigorous proof of the phenomenon of inhibition of one - photon absorption in the limit of infinitely sharp lower levels .",
    "however , such picture is supported also by the following intuitive physical argument .",
    "since the ideal limit of sharp lower levels is equivalent to that of infinite lifetime of the same levels , any measurement aimed at determining the population distribution of the atomic system would always find the system in the lower state .",
    "in other words , any radiative transition involving the upper levels can only be virtual , without actually populating the upper state ( in the sense specified above ) .",
    "thus the corresponding contribution to the emitted radiation must be fully accounted for by the coherent - scattering emissivity given in equation  ( [ eq:2emiss ] ) , in which only the density matrix of the lower state explicitly appears .",
    "equation ( [ eq : red.gen ] ) represents the most general form of redistribution function for a two - term atom with polarized levels that are partially degenerate or non degenerate .",
    "it includes , as particular cases , the redistribution functions for the two- and three - level atoms that have formerly been described in the literature ( see section  [ sec : special ] ) .",

    "we find @xmath81 and from either of these two expressions it follows immediately that @xmath82 the results expressed by equations  ( [ eq : integral2])([eq : red.norm ] ) differ from those derived in the theory of @xcite , where the line shape function in the radiative transfer equation contributed by higher orders is shown to vanish , when integrated over the frequency of either the incoming or the outgoing photon . on the other hand , in bommier s formalism , the contribution of the first - order emissivity is always present , even when the lifetime of the lower term is assumed to be infinite and thus no upper - term excitation should be expected , based on the physical argument presented at the end of section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "thus , in the work of @xcite , the redistribution function always results from the combination of both first- and second - order emissivity terms , even in the limit of infinitely sharp lower levels .",
    "accordingly , redistribution effects are accounted for through a modified emission coefficient where the distinction between true absorption and scattering is lost ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "despite this difference between our respective formalisms , in the collisionless regime and for an unpolarized lower term , we verified that the redistribution function @xmath83 of equation  ( [ eq : red.nclt ] ) coincides with that derived by @xcite ( @xcite , equations  ( 43)(45 ) ; for this demonstration , all level widths in those formulas that correspond to our @xmath84 must be replaced by @xmath85 ) .",
    "the general redistribution function , equation  ( [ eq : red.gen ] ) or ( [ eq : red.gen.alt ] ) , with all the particular cases considered in this section , is expressed in the reference frame of the atom . in realistic applications to the plasma diagnostics of astrophysical objects , we must generalize this function to the laboratory frame , so to include the effects of doppler broadening through the convolution of the atomic velocity distribution ( typical , a maxwellian ) . in order not to burden the presentation of the following discussion",
    ", we provide the details of such derivation in the appendix .",
    "one critical question , in the application of equations  ( [ eq:2emiss ] ) and ( [ eq : red.gen ] ) ( or ( [ eq : red.gen.alt ] ) ) to the study of partial redistribution effects in the presence of external fields , is the proper definition of the level widths , @xmath86 , i.e. , of the lifetimes of atomic states that are in general energetically perturbed by the presence of external fields . if we restrict our considerations to the case of a two - term atom with sharp lower levels , the problem of such definition concerns only the excited states @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( cf .  equation  ( [ eq : red.sharp ] ) ) . to the lowest order of approximation ,",
    "their widths are determined exclusively by the external fields and by the process of spontaneous de - excitation ( in particular , we are neglecting in this treatment the effects of stimulated emission ) .",
    "within such an approximation , the complex frequencies @xmath89 correspond to the eigenvalues of the non - hermitian operator ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the hamiltonian of the atomic system in the presence of the external fields , @xmath92 is the projection operator over the subspace of the states @xmath87 of that hamiltonian , and finally @xmath93 where evidently @xmath94 is the projection operator over the subspace of the lower terms , which is radiatively connected to the subspace of the excited states @xmath87 .",
    "we note how in equation  ( [ eq : damping ] ) we have assumed that the energy separation between the levels of the upper and lower terms can be approximated by a single value @xmath95 .",
    "this is an adequate approximation in most cases of interest for magnetic studies of the solar atmosphere , where the field strengths at play , and the fine structure of the atomic terms , are such that the associated energy separations of the levels are much smaller than @xmath95 .",
    "correspondingly , level mixing and quantum interference are also triggered between relatively close levels , such that the energy span of the atomic terms ( intended here as the sets of the interfering atomic levels ) is much smaller than their average separation @xmath95 . under this approximation , and in the presence of a magnetic field , it is possible to show that the _ damping matrix _",

    ", @xmath97 is also diagonal on the same basis .",
    "thus , _ the level widths for radiative de - excitation correspond to the diagonal elements of the damping matrix _ @xmath96 .",
    "the use of equation  ( [ eq : damping ] ) for determining the line shape of the scattered radiation is adequate when the frequency of the emitted photon is near the atomic resonance . on the other hand ,",
    "away from the resonance condition ( e.g. , in the case of rayleigh scattering in the far wings of a line ) , it is questionable whether the lifetime of the excited state should contain the resonance frequency @xmath95 .",

    "first of all , it is important to remark that , because of the limitations of our current theory of radiation scattering in the absence of collisions , no new contributions can arise that are able to `` dress '' a metastable lower term , and determine thus its radiative lifetime for transitions towards the upper level .",
    "nonetheless , the energy widths @xmath99 of the lower term properly appear in the general form of the redistribution function , since those widths are associated with the complex frequencies @xmath100 . in the case of subordinate lines , for example , we can expect that those widths will have an important contribution from spontaneous de - excitation , which is again determined through equation  ( [ eq : damping ] ) . in the case of a metastable state , instead , the radiative level widths can only be specified _",
    "ad hoc _ , since they are not provided self - consistently by the theory . in real cases , such as for a collisional plasma at a temperature @xmath101",
    ", we can expect that the level widths of a metastable term will predominantly be determined by collisional processes . in the following",

    "thus , in the case of sharp lower levels , and in the absence of collisions , the only 1st - order contribution to equation  ( [ eq : rt.1 ] ) is represented by the absorption term . because there is no excitation of the upper levels ( due to the infinite lifetime of the lower levels ) , in this case the absorption term",
    "does not originate from true photon absorption , and corresponds instead to the atom s cross - section for the coherent scattering of radiation ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : balance ] ) .",
    "in contrast , when the lifetime of the lower levels for transitions towards the upper term is finite , one must also account for the emissivity term of the first order in equation  ( [ eq : rt.1 ] ) , which is associated with the spontaneous de - excitation of the atom following the excitation of the upper term . in this section",

    "this also turns out to be identical with the analogous result derived by @xcite , in the limit of sharp and unpolarized lower level considered by those authors .",
    "a fundamental property of the transport of radiation in a collisionless gas of atoms at the statistical equilibrium ( i.e. , under stationary conditions , such that the internal energy of the atomic ensemble does not change with time ) is that the radiation s energy flux through a closed surface containing the gas must be zero .",

    "because our present theory can not account for the broadening of the lower levels due to photon absorption ( see discussion at the end of section  [ sec : lifetimes ] ) , in order to guarantee the self - consistency of this verification , we only consider the case of infinitely sharp lower levels .",
    "it must be noted that this choice is consistent with the approximation of neglecting stimulated emission .",
    "in fact , if the incident radiation field is strong enough to induce any appreciable broadening of the lower levels , then one should also expect that stimulation effects will be comparatively important , and therefore should be included in the picture .",
    "this is certainly the case when the objective is to verify the energy balance among the various radiation processes .    as a consequence of the assumption of infinite lifetime of the lower level ,",
    "we then must drop the contribution of the 1st - order emissivity to the radiative energy balance .",
    "nonetheless , we will retain a finite width of the lower levels in the expressions of the line profiles , for the sake of this demonstration .",

    "the verification of the radiative balance condition in the collisionless regime can then be set up in general form starting from equation  ( [ eq : rt.1 ] ) . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that the incident radiation is unpolarized , @xmath168 we then can ignore the contribution from the absorption terms associated with the magneto - optical effects ( see equation  ( [ eq : magnetooptical ] ) ) , and only need to consider the expression of the absorption coefficient adopting the same notations used in writing equation  ( [ eq:2emiss.1 ] ) , @xmath169 using the tabulated expressions for @xmath105 @xcite , we can show that @xmath170 with the above assumptions , and for @xmath171 , from equations  ( [ eq : rt.1 ] ) , ( [ eq:2emiss.1 ] ) , ( [ eq : dichroic ] ) , and ( [ eq : absorb.gen ] ) , after some straightforward algebra , we find @xmath172 where in the last equivalence we used the definition of @xmath173 , equations  ( [ eq : gen_width ] ) and ( [ eq : einstein a ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we neglect the ( weak ) dependence of @xmath173 on the frequency of the scattered radiation , so that it can be taken outside the integral in the last line of equation  ( [ eq : balance ] ) .",

    "it is important to note that the approximations involved in this verification are dominated by the assumption that the energy separation among the lower levels @xmath1 is much smaller than the frequency of the incident radiation , @xmath180 , so that the energy values of those levels can all be approximated by the average @xmath176 . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",

    "it is important to remark that the above result does _ not _ imply that the emitted radiation gets counted twice when we include the coherent - scattering term in the radiative transfer equation , as this would evidently violate energy conservation .",
    "we have previously noted that the excitation of @xmath2 is inhibited in the limit of infinitely sharp lower levels , and therefore all the emitted radiation must come from the coherent - scattering term in that case .",
    "then , if the illumination of the atom is spectrally flat , the above demonstration shows that the scattered radiation has exactly the same spectral structure _ as if _ the atom had absorbed and re - emitted incoherently the incident radiation ( cf .",
    "we presented a general expression of the redistribution function for polarized radiation in the case of a transition between two atomic terms @xmath65 and @xmath87 , which can both be partially degenerate and polarized , and subject to a magnetic field of arbitrary strength .",

    "this function is derived from first principles , and it represents a preliminary result of a diagrammatic theory of scattering polarization that we have been developing , on and off , over the past decade .",
    "the full theory is still incomplete , lacking a self - consistent set of accompanying equations for the statistical equilibrium of the atomic system .",
    "part of the problem is caused by a mild violation of the positivity condition for the atomic density matrix in the presence of magnetic fields . following a revision of our diagrammatic approach , inspired by certain literature dealing with the problem of the treatment of the initial conditions in perturbative master equations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references within ; a very clear discussion of this problem can also be found in a recent paper by @xcite ) , we have identified new terms , previously unaccounted for , in the perturbative expansion of the evolution equation for the atomic density matrix .",
    "these terms are in the process of being evaluated , with the perspective that they should restore the self - consistency of the statistical - equilibrium problem .    because of the approximations of the theory , we can not rigorously model the radiative broadening of the atomic levels due to photon absorption . therefore , in the absence of collisions , the lower term of an atomic transition remains infinitely sharp , and the scattered radiation only comes from the coherent contribution to the emissivity , equation  ( [ eq:2emiss ] ) .",
    "however , we presented the general form of the redistribution function , equation  ( [ eq : red.gen ] ) , where the widths of the lower levels appear explicitly .",

    "the results we presented are relevant enough for the spectro - polarimetric diagnostics of the upper layers of the sun s atmosphere , that we decided to propose them , already at this early stage , to the astrophysical community .    in this paper , we limited ourselves to provide the algebraic formulas for the scattered radiation in a complex two - term atom with hyperfine structure , and in the presence of a magnetic field ( relevant , for instance , to the case of the resonant d - doublet , or of complex subordinate lines such as h@xmath37 ) .",
    "numerical applications of this formalism will be considered in future papers .    finally , it is important to note that the general redistribution function presented in this paper , equation  ( [ eq : red.gen ] ) or ( [ eq : red.gen.alt ] ) , coincides with a rarely quoted result by @xcite , which was derived through a completely different approach to the problem of resonance scattering ( based on @xcite ) .",
