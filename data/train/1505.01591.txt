    "quantum mechanics has been a tremendously successful theory for describing microscopic systems . till date",
    "there has not been a single experiment which can demonstrate a violation of quantum theory .",
    "the success of quantum mechanics is so widespread and robust that people have come to believe that it is the ultimate theory for describing microscopic systems , and that classical mechanics should be an approximation of quantum mechanics in an appropriate limit .",
    "however , this transition from quantum to classical has been a sticky issue since the time of the very inception of quantum theory .",
    "while the state of a classical particle is adequately described by the knowledge of its position and momentum , quantum mechanics does not even allow simultaneous well defined values of these two quantities .",
    "the state of a quantum particle is strangely described by a complex entity called the wave function .",
    "although the dynamics of state , or the wave - function , is exactly described by the schrdinger equation , the meaning of measurable quantities takes an altogether different meaning .",
    "an observable described by an operator @xmath0 is believed to have a well defined value only if the state of the system is an eigenstate of this operator , namely , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is called the eigenvalue of the observable .",
    "eigenvalue is also the outcome in a measurement of the observable @xmath0 .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 on identical copies of same system , in the state ( say ) @xmath3 , will all lead to the same result @xmath4 .",
    "thus , an eigenvalue is a well defined value of @xmath0 if the system is in its eigenstate .",
    "however , if the system is in a state ( say ) @xmath5 which is not an eigenstate of @xmath0 , the value which one should assign to the observable described by @xmath0 is ambiguous .",
    "all one can do is to define an _ expectation value _ of @xmath0 as @xmath6 a measurement of @xmath0 in the state @xmath7 would still yield an eigenvalue , one from the set @xmath8 .",
    "however , the important difference is that measurements of @xmath0 on identical copies of same system , in the state @xmath5 , will all lead to different eigenvalues .",
    "the state @xmath5 can be expanded in terms of the eigenstates of @xmath0 as @xmath9 where @xmath10 are some complex numbers .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath11 can now be written as @xmath12 the above expression is conventionally interpreted as average of the measurement results on a large ensemble of identically prepared systems in the state @xmath5 .",
    "a fraction @xmath13 of the total systems yield the eigenvalue @xmath4 .",
    "the point to note in the above example is that while the value of @xmath11 is well defined for a single system in an eigenstate @xmath3 , the expectation value @xmath14 in a state @xmath5 can not be defined for a single system .",
    "it appears to have a meaning only for a large number of measurements on an ensemble of identical systems .",
    "issues like the one described above , still plague quantum theory , although they are mainly interpretational issues .",
    "what sense one should make of the formalism of quantum theory , is not clear .",
    "while evolution of quantum systems are very well understood , what happens in a measurement process is not clear .",
    "this is simply because the apparatus we use is classical , and how information from a quantum system is carried over to the classical apparatus is not part of the quantum formalism",
    ". quantum theory merely postulates that in a measurement process , the value obtained is an eigenvalue of the observable being measured , it results in the reduction of the original state to the corresponding eigenstate of the observable .",
    "how this process comes about is not understood , and remains an open problem .",
    "john von neumann was the first one to attempt putting a quantum measurement process on a mathematical footing.@xcite according to neumann , a quantum measurement can be broken up into two processes .",
    "* process 1 is a unitary process which establishes correlations between the state of the system and state of the apparatus .",
    "it basically correlates the various amplitudes of the system state to various possible outcomes of the apparatus .",
    "the apparatus too has to be treated as a quantum system .",
    "for example if the initial state @xmath5 is given by @xmath15 and the initial state of the apparatus is given by @xmath16 , then the process 1 is a unitary operation @xmath17 { } \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i|d_i\\rangle|a_i\\rangle .",
    "\\label{p1}\\ ] ] what process 1 has done is to correlate the eigenstates of @xmath0 with distinct states of the apparatus .",
    "the states @xmath18 could , for example , corresponds to some discreet positions of a pointer needle .",
    "* process 2 is a non - unitary one which picks out a single outcome from the superposition described by ( [ p1 ] ) : @xmath19 { }     \\label{p1}\\ ] ] it is obvious that process 2 can not be realized through schrdinger evolution .",
    "the process 2 constitutes the heart of the so - called _",
    "measurement problem_.    the mechanism behind process 2 has confounded scientists since the beginning of the quantum theory .",
    "it is no surprise that people have come up with suggested resolutions which can be considered radical to fantastic like the everett many worlds interpretation@xcite or the grw proposal.@xcite      let us first put von neumann process 1 on a rigorous mathematical footing .",
    "process 1 can be constructed by a suitable interaction between the system and the apparatus and a time evolution .",
    "conventional quantum measurements may be considered as the result of a strong interaction between the system and the apparatus , active for a short duration of time .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system and the apparatus may be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 represent the free hamiltonians of the system and the apparatus , respectively , and @xmath22 the operators of the system and the apparatus through which they interact .",
    "we introduce another observable @xmath23 conjugate to @xmath23 , such that @xmath24 = i\\hbar$ ] and @xmath25 .",
    "the apparatus is prepared in an initial state @xmath26 which is a packet of @xmath27 states , centered at @xmath28 .",
    "the initial state of the system @xmath29 can be expanded in terms of the eigenstates of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 .",
    "let us assume that the measurement interaction is switched on at @xmath33 and continues till @xmath34 , with the proviso @xmath35 .",
    "the state , after the measurement interaction , is given by @xmath36    the measurement interaction results in various eigenstates of @xmath30 becoming entangled with packets of @xmath27 states of the apparatus , localized at different values of @xmath37 .",
    "a narrow packet localized at @xmath38 , for example , would imply a measured eigenvalue @xmath39 of the system .",
    "however , at this stage there is not one outcome , but a superposition of various outcomes , with different probabilities .",
    "the preceding discussion of quantum measurement has an interesting consequence for single systems , i.e. , systems for which an ensemble of identical copies is not available .",
    "if the state is a priori unknown , and an ensemble of identical copies is available , one can perform many measurements on different copies , and from the resulting probabilities of various outcomes @xmath40 , try to infer the values of @xmath41 and reconstruct the original state using @xmath31 .    however , if there is only a single system available , one can choose to make one measurement , which will give one a single eigenvalue ( say ) @xmath39 , and the state would have collapsed to @xmath42 .",
    "the measurements gives absolutely no information regarding the original state @xmath29 .",
    "these means that if the state of a single system is unknown , it will always remain unknown .",
    "this is something profound and implies that an unknown reality can not be unveiled , even in principle .",
    "the expectation value of any observable always has a well defined value in any state .",
    "but the question that arises is whether expectation value has any meaning for a single quantum system .",
    "since the only interpretation of the expectation value traditionally understood is in terms of repeated measurements on an ensemble , the answer seems to be that expectation value has no meaning for a single quantum system .",
    "however , if one could somehow _ measure _ the expectation value of an observable in a single measurement , one could argue that it has a meaning . if one could measure the expectation value of an unknown state",
    ", it would imply that the expectation value has an objective reality , and would probably lend credence to the objective reality of the quantum state itself .",
    "about twenty two years back aharonov , anandan and vaidman ( aav ) proposed a quantum measurement scheme involving very weak and adiabatic measurements , which they called `` protective '' measurements , @xcite where they claimed the possibility of actually measuring the expectation value of any observable in a restricted class of states .",
    "the proposal initially raised surprise and scepticism among many @xcite .",
    "while conventional quantum measurements are considered strong and impulsive , protective measurements make use of the opposite limit where the coupling between the system and the apparatus is _ weak _ and _",
    "adiabatic_. for protective measurements to work , the system should be in a non - degenerate eigenstate of its hamiltonian .",
    "the interaction should be so weak and adiabatic that one can not neglect the free hamiltonians .",
    "let the hamiltonian of the combined system be @xmath43 where various entities have the same meaning as in the preceding section .",
    "the coupling @xmath44 acts for a long time @xmath45 and is switched on and switched off smoothly .",
    "the interaction is normalized as @xmath46 , and is assumed to be small and almost constant for the most part , justifying the approximation , @xmath47 . if @xmath48 is the state vector of the combined apparatus - system just before the measurement process begins , the state vector after t is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the time ordering operator .",
    "since the time dependence of the hamiltonian is trivial , we may divide the interval @xmath51 $ ] into @xmath52 equal intervals @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 .",
    "since the full hamiltonian commutes with itself at different times during @xmath51 $ ] , one can write ( [ psit ] ) as @xmath55\\right]^n |\\psi(0)\\rangle . \\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in order to solve the dynamics , one has to worry about whether different operators sitting in the exponential commute with each other or not .",
    "since designing the apparatus is in the hands of the experimenter , we consider the case when @xmath56 commutes with the free hamiltonian of the apparatus , i.e. , @xmath57=0 $ ] , so that we can have eigenstates @xmath58 such that @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the operators of the system , @xmath61 , may or may not commute with each other , the energy eigenstates of the system are given by @xmath62 the states @xmath58 are also the exact eigenstates of the instantaneous hamiltonian @xmath63 , in the apparatus subspace .",
    "so , the exact instantaneous eigenstates can be written in a factorized form @xmath64 where @xmath65 are defined by @xmath66 the system states @xmath65 depend on the eigenvalue of @xmath67 .",
    "let us assume the initial state to be a direct product of a non - degenerate eigenstate of @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath26 : @xmath70 introducing complete set of exact eigenstates in the above equation , the wave function at a time @xmath45 can now be written as @xmath71 can be written as @xmath72    till this point we have not made any approximations , except for ignoring the switching on and switching off times .",
    "now if the measurement interaction is very weak and highly adiabatic , @xmath73 is very small , so that @xmath74 in the large @xmath45 limit , one can assume the states to be unperturbed , i.e. , @xmath75 .",
    "the energy eigenvalues now assume the form @xmath76 assuming the states of to be unperturbed and the energy to be first order in @xmath73 amounts to doing a first order perturbation theory . in this approximation @xmath77 , and",
    "the sum over @xmath78 disappears and only the term where @xmath79 survives .",
    "this allows us to write the apparatus part of the exponent again in the operator form latexmath:[\\[|\\psi(t)\\rangle \\approx e^{-{i\\over\\hbar}h_a t-{i\\over\\hbar } q_a\\langle q_s\\rangle _",
    "\\nu -{i\\over\\hbar}\\langle h_s\\rangle _ \\nu t }     since @xmath56 is an operator conjugate to @xmath23 , it will act as a generator of translation for @xmath27 states .",
    "the second term in the exponent will shift the center of the packet @xmath26 by an amount @xmath81 : latexmath:[\\[|\\psi(t)\\rangle = e^{-{i\\over\\hbar}h_a t-{i\\over\\hbar}\\nu t }    thus , at the end of the measurement interaction , the center of the apparatus packet @xmath26 shifts by @xmath83 .",
    "the apparatus thus records , not the eigenvalue of @xmath30 as in ( [ strong ] ) , but its expectation value in the initial _ unknown _ state @xmath69 . not only that , within this approximation the system and the apparatus are not entangled .",
    "protective measurements were widely misunderstood and resulted in a lot of criticism .",
    "@xcite here we list some features of protective measurements which should clarify various issues which were raised .    * protective measurements do nt require that the state of the system be a - priori fully known .",
    "+ example : atom in a trap where one may not know the exact potential , but does know that the atom will be in the ground state .",
    "+ one may have made made an energy measurement on a system to know that the system is in a particular energy eigenstate , but without the knowledge of the hamiltonian one can not know what the eigenstate is , and hence finding the expectation value of an observable is not possible . *",
    "the shift in the pointer state is proportional to the expectation value of the observable being measured . *",
    "the expectation value is obtained in one single measurement , on a single system . * as shown in the preceding analysis , observable whose expectation value is measured , need not commute with the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "an objection with a contradicting claim was raised by uffink.@xcite shan gao pointed out the flaw in the argument.@xcite * the system is not entangled with the apparatus after the measurement . * the state of the system does not change after the measurement ( within the approximation used ) .",
    "* expectation value of another operator can be measured , after the measurement of one .",
    "it has also been demonstrated that protective measurements can , in principle , be performed even in the most general case where @xmath57\\neq 0 $ ] and @xmath84\\neq 0 $ ] .",
    "@xcite however in actual practice , finding the right observables for the apparatus , and satisfying all the constraints may be a formidable challenge .",
    "this is so because in this case , the initial apparatus is not supposed to be a packet of eigenstates of the operator conjugate to @xmath56 . rather it is supposed to be a packet of eigenstates of the operator conjugate to an operator @xmath85 define as @xmath86 where various entities have the same meaning as in the preceding analysis .",
    "whether such an operator can always be found in practice , is an open question .    in all this analysis",
    "we have not considered the dynamical effect of the  free \" hamiltonian of the apparatus .",
    "this hamiltonian will cause the spreading of the packet of the initial apparatus state .",
    "in normal course of action , one would have ignored this effect . however , since the protective measurements are supposed to be adiabatic , the effect of the apparatus hamiltonian , though small , will be cumulative . in other words ,",
    "the pointer packet may spread considerably during the course of protective measurement interaction .",
    "finding the centre of a large packet , to read out the measured expectation value , would be a difficult task , and one may have to apply some special techniques to do that . @xcite",
    "the success of protective measurements crucially depends on the assumption that the entanglement between the system and the apparatus can be made negligibly small , but the system will still shift the pointer state by a finite amount .",
    "let us now quantify the effect of the terms we have neglected till now .",
    "if we consider the state of the system and apparatus to be perturbed to first order in @xmath73 , as opposed to being unperturbed in the preceding analysis , the final state , to next higher order in @xmath73 , would look like @xmath87 where @xmath88 involve matrix elements of @xmath89 among various unperturbed states , and unperturbed energies .",
    "the above is an entangled state , and in a real measurement there is a probability that the original state of the system , which was @xmath69 to begin with , gets changed to ( say ) @xmath90 , and the apparatus state gets shifted by @xmath91 .",
    "the probability of this happening is proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "one can see that by increasing @xmath45 and weakening the interaction , the probability of the protective measurement failing can be made smaller , but can never be made zero .",
    "in general , it has been rigorously shown that the _ state disturbance _ in protective measurements scales as @xmath92.@xcite this indicates that although a practical implementation of protective measurement is possible , for a single unknown state , one can never be sure that the protective measurement has yielded the expectation value in the original state .",
    "hence it can not be used to argue for a strict objective reality of the wave - function .",
    "the idea of protective measurements was proposed more than two decades back , but an experimental demonstration of the same is still lacking .",
    "the reason for this is that there are several constraints which the system and the apparatus should satisfy before one can carry out a successful protective measurement .",
    "the adiabatic nature of interaction may also present some difficulty .",
    "a proposal was made for testing protective measurements using cold atoms in a stern - gerlach like setup.@xcite we briefly describe it in the following .",
    "low velocity of cold atoms may be exploited for achieving adiabaticity to some degree .",
    "the hamiltonian of the atom with mass @xmath93 and magnetic moment @xmath78 , can be written as @xmath94    initial system - apparatus state : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a gaussian wave - packet in the momentum space , with zero average momentum , and a width @xmath97 in momentum space .",
    "the state after a time @xmath45 is given by @xmath98 the position operators @xmath99 will act as a generator of translation in momentum space , and the system - apparatus state , at the end of the measurement interaction , is given by @xmath100 the state of the spin and the state of the atom are disentangled , and @xmath101 is a gaussian with a momentum @xmath102 , with a width @xmath103    if one uses the following experimental parameters : @xmath104 mm , @xmath105 cm , @xmath106 gauss , atom velocity : @xmath107 cm / s ,    momentum shift @xmath108 momentum spread    as the atom travels after coming out of the interaction region , it position will shift , because of the non - zero average momentum .",
    "position shift after 30 sec evolution after interaction will about about 2 cm .",
    "we have described protective measurements which are a promising tool for probing single systems , i.e. , systems for which an ensemble of identical quantum states is not available .",
    "protective measurements lend a new experimental meaning to the quantum expectation value which , traditionally , has meaning only in the context of many eigenvalue measurements over an ensemble . although protective measurements can be practically used to measure the expectation value in a single measurement , the non - zero error which is always present , rules out using the same to assign any object reality to the wave - function",
