    "as brown dwarfs cool over time , their atmospheres undergo a sequence of chemical and physical changes that result in an evolving emergent spectrum and  consequently  varying spectral types .",
    "the most remarkable changes take place at the l to t type transition .",
    "the latest l dwarfs have red near - infrared colors , strong co absorption in @xmath2 band and relatively shallow water absorption bands modulating their spectra . over a small effective temperature range of only 100 to 200@xmath3k",
    "the spectrum rapidly changes to exhibit blue near - infrared color , weakening co absorption , strengthening @xmath4 absorption , and deeper water bands ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the proximal cause of these changes is the loss of cloud opacity .",
    "as clouds dissipate the visible atmosphere cools , bringing on the chemical change from ch@xmath5 to co. without clouds providing a significant , nearly gray opacity , flux can emerge through molecular opacity windows in the j and h bands with a brightening leading to a blueward color shift ( dahn et al .",
    "2010 , tinney et al .",
    "2003 , vrba et al . 2004 ) .",
    "studies of @xmath6 binary dwarfs ( e.g. , liu et al .",
    "2006 ; looper et al . 2008",
    "; stumpf et al . 2010 and references therein ) show that this brightening is an intrinsic signature of the transition and not the manifestation of some other effect in color - magnitude diagrams @xcite .",
    "two main underlying causes of this loss in cloud opacity have been suggested . in one view",
    "the atmospheric dynamical state changes , resulting in larger particle sizes that more rapidly ` rain out ' of the atmosphere , leading to a sudden clearing or collapse of the cloud @xcite .",
    "this view is supported by fits of spectra to model spectra @xcite computed with the @xcite cloud model . in that formalism",
    "a tunable parameter , @xmath7 controls cloud particle sizes and optical depth .",
    "larger @xmath7 yields larger particles along with physically and optically thinner clouds .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have demonstrated that progressively later t dwarfs can be fit by increasing @xmath7 across the transition .",
    "late t dwarfs are generally best fit by models that neglect cloud opacity .",
    "@xcite also suggest changes in cloud particle sizes as a possible mechanism .",
    "the second view is inspired by thermal infrared images of the atmospheres of jupiter and saturn at @xmath8 m",
    "( e.g , westphal 1969 ; westphal et al .",
    "1974 ; orton et al . 1996",
    "; baines et al . 2005 ) . in this spectral region",
    "gaseous opacity is very low , allowing flux from deeply seated , warm atmospheric regions to escape .",
    "higher lying clouds , however , locally reduce the emergent flux . as a result",
    "these planets take on a mottled appearance with bright high - flux , low cloud opacity regions lying adjacent to cooler , darker , and cloudier regions ( optical depth varies from @xmath9 to @xmath10 between these regions @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that the arrival of such cloud holes near the end of the l spectral sequence may be responsible for the l to t transition .",
    "@xcite tested this hypothesis with a simple ` toy model ' by summing weighted contributions of the spectra of cloudy and cloudless models .",
    "they showed that the observed @xmath1 band brightening across the transition could arise from decreasing cloud coverage .",
    "further support for this hypothesis comes from observations of l and t dwarf variability .",
    "while previous studies were somewhat equivocal ( summarized in @xcite ) , two early t dwarfs have recently been shown to have large near - infrared photometric variability @xcite consistent with surface variations in cloud coverage modulated by rotation .",
    "the approach to modeling holes of burgasser et al .",
    "was highly simplistic .",
    "the principal shortcoming being that it is not physically correct to combine the contributions of separate cloudy and cloudless models .",
    "deep in the atmosphere of a brown dwarf the entropy in the convection zone must match that of the interior .",
    "thus the temperature at a given , deep , pressure level is expected to be horizontally constant .",
    "however for a fixed @xmath11 a cloudy atmosphere is everywhere hotter than a cloudless atmosphere . as an example figure 1 presents model atmosphere profiles for a uniform cloudy and a cloudless atmosphere following the techniques of @xcite and @xcite . at depth , the cloudy profile is warmer than the cloudless profile by over 400@xmath3k ; the difference in some models is even greater .",
    "thus standard cloudy and cloudless models can not simultaneously be valid descriptions of the real atmosphere at two locations even though both models are descriptions of an atmosphere with the same @xmath11 .",
    "clearly a new technique for self - consistently treating partly cloudy atmospheres is required . while we do not yet understand why cloud",
    "holes might appear , we here present a new approach inspired from models of earth s atmosphere to model their influence and apply our results to model the spectra and colors of l and t dwarfs .",
    "instead of combining _ separately _",
    "computed profiles for purely cloudy and cloud - free dwarfs we wish to construct a _ single , global _ temperature - pressure profile @xmath12 that incorporates simultaneously the influences of both cloudy and cloud - free regions on the energy balance of the atmosphere .",
    "the final profile should conserve the total flux while allowing for nearby atmospheric regions to have differing cloud  but not thermal  profiles .",
    "this conceptually allows clouds to be displaced by winds , updrafts , or downdrafts and change location , as long as the global mean cloud fraction is constant .    in three - dimensional terrestrial numerical weather prediction and climate models ,",
    "clouds are typically smaller than the adopted computational grid scale .",
    "various methods are used to treat this in the radiative transfer calculations , one of which is to consider separate cloudy and cloud - free _ sub - columns _ in the _ same _ model column , with a single @xmath12 structure .",
    "this same approach can be used in a single column model of the earth , allowing the global annual mean energy budget to be reproduced ( goldblatt & zahnle 2010 ) .",
    "physically , such considerations are most important on earth in the tropics . taking the zonal mean @xmath12 and moisture profile would give a local runaway greenhouse due to the high water vapor content .",
    "however , dry areas in the tropics caused by subsiding air act as `` radiator fins '' , allowing radiation from the surface to escape to space ( peirrehumbert 1995 ) . in brown dwarfs atmospheres , cloud free areas would be analogous to the subsidence regions in earth s tropics .    to implement this approach we set the parameter @xmath13 to be the fraction of the atmosphere described by the cloud free sub - column , from which the local flux at some level in the atmosphere is @xmath14 .",
    "the remaining fraction @xmath15 is the cloudy sub - column , with local flux @xmath16 .",
    "both sub - columns share the same @xmath17 profile but have different emergent flux , in general @xmath18 .",
    "we compute the total flux , @xmath19 through the atmosphere , which is used in the radiative - convective equilibrium calculation , as @xmath20 we stress that this is not a combination of separate models , but rather conceptually represents two adjacent sub - columns in the atmosphere with the same thermal profile and differing opacity .",
    "our radiative - convective equilibrium model is then employed to solve for a single @xmath12 atmospheric thermal profile ( mckay et al .",
    "1989 ; marley & mckay 1999 ) that carries net flux @xmath21 through all statically stable layers of the atmosphere .",
    "layers that would be convectively unstable in pure radiative - equilibrium are iteratively adjusted to follow an adiabat . the cloud profile and atmospheric chemistry",
    "are updated along with the atmospheric profile as it is converged to a solution , so the final thermal , chemical , and cloud profiles are all mutually self - consistent .",
    "a sampling of resulting model profiles is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the hottest profile is for a global , homogeneous @xmath22 model while the coolest model assumes no cloud opacity . adding a small fraction of cloud free area to the @xmath22 cloudy model efficiently cools the atmospheric profile . in the example shown",
    "setting @xmath23 produces a model that lies over one - third of the way between the fully cloudy ( @xmath22 ) and the cloudless ( nc ) models in the region above @xmath24 . increasing the surface area fraction of holes to @xmath25 produces an even cooler model . for comparison",
    "the figure also presents a homogeneous cloudy model with a much higher sedimentation efficiency , @xmath26 . this model with globally low cloud opacity follows a @xmath12 profile very similar to the partly cloudy model with thicker clouds ( @xmath22 ) with 50% of cloud - free regions .",
    "we have found that this is generally the case : a partly cloudy model presents a similar thermal profile to a model with a thinner cloud , a point we return to in  4 .",
    "the synthetic spectrum for a converged @xmath12 atmospheric profile is obtained from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we compute absolute magnitudes and colors with the ultracool dwarf evolution models of @xcite .",
    "figure 2 shows synthetic near - infrared photometry from the partly cloudly models . for a _ fixed _",
    "@xmath11 , as @xmath27 is increased the model colors briskly move to the blue in @xmath0 and @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath1 band flux increases as @xmath27 increases from 0 to 0.75 , but then dims slightly for cloud free models ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this is because atmospheres with even a small cloud cover are warmer in the atmospheric region from which the @xmath1 band flux emerges . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath30 is relatively constant across the transition from @xmath31 to @xmath29 at constant @xmath11 but shows a similar dimming as @xmath32 .",
    "the evolution of model dwarfs with fixed @xmath7 produces trajectories that do not exhibit a rapid l to t transition as a global homogenous cloud sinks too gradually below the photosphere ( burrows et al . 2006 ; saumon & marley 2008 , fig .",
    "4 ) . with the @xcite cloud model",
    ", the l to t dwarf transition can only be modeled with an increase of the cloud sedimentation parameter @xmath7 .",
    "figure 2 demonstrates that the transition can also be described as a progressive increase in cloud - free areas at a fixed @xmath7 and @xmath33 .",
    "the l / t transition dwarf colors and the j band brightening are well fit by this approach .",
    "however , 1200@xmath3k is slightly cooler than the observed @xmath11 temperature of the transition of @xmath34 ( golimowski et al .",
    "2004 ; stephens et al . 2009 ) and if @xmath11 falls appreciably across the transition the j band bump would be weakened ( fig .",
    "2 ) . for a different choice of @xmath7 and model gravity a different transition @xmath35 would be expected .",
    "as noted in saumon & marley , there is an offset of @xmath36 to the blue in the @xmath0 color of models from the bulk of l and t dwarf photometry .",
    "this may arise from shortcomings in the @xmath2 band pressure - induced opacity of molecular hydrogen .",
    "nonetheless , the trend of the late t dwarf @xmath0 color can be better reproduced with models with @xmath37 . in the @xmath30 vs. @xmath28 diagram ,",
    "the behavior of field l dwarfs and late t dwarfs are better reproduced by the cloudy @xmath22 and the cloudless sequences , respectively although the latter would also be better matched with partly cloudy models with @xmath38 .",
    "this suggests the spectra of late t dwarfs could be influenced by clouds , contrary to the usual assumption @xcite .",
    "in saumon & marley ( 2008 ) we demonstrated that by increasing the cloud sedimentation efficiency @xmath7 as a brown dwarf cools from @xmath39 to 1200@xmath3k , the predicted model colors reproduce those across the l to t transition . in the previous section we likewise showed that increasing fractional cloudiness  at fixed @xmath7  has the same result .",
    "this leads us to consider how to distinguish the two cases .    as shown in figure 1 a partly cloudy @xmath12 profile ( based on a @xmath22 cloud )",
    "can be nearly identical to a model with a thinner homogeneous cloud but the spectrum from these two models are not necessarily the same because the former uses eq .",
    "( 1 ) to compute the flux . in the partly cloudy case",
    "some flux from deep , hot regions of the atmosphere ( @xmath40 is escaping through the clear regions that are otherwise totally shielded by the cloud in the homogeneous case ( see the middle panel of figure 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "thus we expect that even for identical @xmath12 profiles the emission spectra will differ .",
    "indeed that is the case as shown in figure 4 which shows spectra computed from profiles shown in figure 1 .",
    "focusing on the @xmath1 band , which features the lowest molecular opacity and the deepest atmospheric window in the near - infrared @xcite , the greatest flux is found for the cloudless model .",
    "the homogenous cloudy @xmath22 model is faintest , with the @xmath26 case falling in between . even though the partly cloudy @xmath25 model has essentially the same thermal profile as the @xmath26 model",
    ", it is brighter in the @xmath1 band because some flux is escaping from deeper in the atmosphere .",
    "of course flux conservation requires that the partly cloudy model must be fainter at other wavelengths , here in @xmath2 band .",
    "thus the model spectra are increasingly bluer in the near - infrared from @xmath41 to @xmath42 to the partly cloudy model .",
    "figure 4 shows that the partly cloudy model is very close to the @xmath42 homogeneous cloudy model at wavelengths where the flux is low and emitted from the upper atmosphere , and intermediate between @xmath42 and cloudless in the @xmath43 flux peaks where part of the flux comes from the deeper atmosphere .",
    "thus , for a given @xmath11 and gravity , the presence of holes in the cloud cover have a discernible effect on the near - infrared spectrum .    for a given observed spectrum , where @xmath11 , gravity and composition are not known _ a priori _ ,",
    "how can we distinguish a partly from a homogeneous cloudy atmosphere ?",
    "we explored this problem by fitting the near - infrared partly cloudy model spectra with our large library of cloudy models , using the method of @xcite , and allowing @xmath11 , gravity , and @xmath44 to vary freely .",
    "we find that in general , the best fitting cloudy model has the same gravity , the same @xmath11 ( or slightly higher by @xmath45k ) and a higher @xmath44 depending on @xmath27 .",
    "the fitted cloudy spectra are close to the partly cloudy spectra , and some of the differences can be attributed to the grid spacing of the cloudy models .",
    "it appears that the @xmath43 colors of a partly cloudy model ( @xmath11 , @xmath46 , @xmath44 , @xmath27 ) can be well matched with a cloudy model ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "the differences in the near - infrared spectrum are thus subtle and comparable to the differences found between observed spectra and the best fitting models ( e.g. @xcite ) . given that even with bolometric luminosity measurements @xmath11 temperatures can not yet be measured to much better than @xmath50 precision , effective temperature can not yet provide a strong constraint on @xmath27 .",
    "the most promising avenue to distinguish the two models in the l / t transition spectroscopically appears to be strong spectral features that are very sensitive to temperature and that are formed in the deeper , hotter regions of the atmospheres , such as the 0.99@xmath51 m band of feh and the alkali doublets of na i ( @xmath52 m ) and k i ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 m ) .",
    "those should become stronger as the cloud coverage decreases .    given these considerations",
    ", variability may be the best method of characterizing cloud patchiness in brown dwarfs .",
    "partly cloudy dwarfs may be variable if the lengthscales of the cloudy patches are large enough and if the viewing inclination is not near pole on .",
    "variations in the geometry of the cloud cover ( `` weather '' ) would also lead to detectable variations in brightness on time scales different from the rotation period .",
    "indeed there is indication that a sizable fraction of l dwarfs are variable @xcite .",
    "sample sizes are as yet too small to determine if blue l dwarfs or l / t transition objects show greater variability than other l dwarfs , but systematic studies would elucidate any trends .",
    "polarization is another possible way to distinguish partly from fully cloudy objects .",
    "cloud free brown dwarfs should not show appreciable polarization @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that very rapidly rotating , low gravity dwarfs with homogenous clouds can show sizeable polarization , but only for rotation periods less than about 4 hours .",
    "however partly cloudy l dwarfs may show a polarization signal at @xmath55 band consistent with that observed in some objects @xcite .",
    "measurable polarization in a slowly rotating or high gravity brown dwarf would point to the presence of inhomogeneous cloud cover .",
    "there is growing evidence that the transition from the l to the t spectral class happens over a small effective temperature range ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is difficult for any model of a globally uniform , homogenous cloud to either sink out of sight or precipitate rapidly enough to account for the observed rapid change in spectral properties .",
    "instead the transition may arise as holes appear in an otherwise uniform global cloud deck .",
    "we have presented the first self - consistent method for computing one - dimensional global atmospheric profiles appropriate to an atmosphere which has both clear and cloudy patches .",
    "the model does not depend upon the physical sizes of the patches , nor does it explain why patches might appear , but rather parameterizes the global fraction of clear and cloudy regions .",
    "the resulting @xmath12 profiles converged to by our model are intermediate in temperature between hot , cloudy models and colder , cloudless ones .",
    "we confirm the conclusion of @xcite , who used a more simplistic model to argue that patchiness in brown dwarf clouds is a plausible mechanism for the l to t type transition .",
    "in addition to the l to t transition , patchy clouds have been suggested by @xcite as a possible mechanism to explain those l dwarfs that have unusually blue near - infrared colors @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a @xmath56 model with thin ( @xmath26 ) clouds provides a good spectral match to the blue l dwarf 2mass j11265003 .",
    "we find that in this effective temperature regime a model with thicker ( @xmath22 ) and 50% cloud coverage produces a comparable spectrum .",
    "thus we agree with @xcite that partial cloudiness is potential alternative mechanism to thin global clouds for the blue l dwarfs .",
    "differences in cloud coverage might result from different rotational rates , gravities , or even viewing geometries ( pole vs. equator ) .",
    "the growing evidence for temporal photometric variability at the l to t transition @xcite supports the plausibility of partial cloudiness being responsible for the change in colors across the transition .",
    "future 3-dimensional simulations of brown dwarf atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) coupled with a new generation of cloud models will likely help to elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for cloud fragmentation at @xmath571300@xmath3k . in the meantime",
    "additional observations of brown dwarf photometric variability and observations of l / t binaries will shed light on this poorly understood phase of their evolution .",
