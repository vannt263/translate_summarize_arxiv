    "a number of advanced analytical and numerical techniques have been developed to study the quench dynamics for a variety of different situations and realistic models @xcite .",
    "however , many insights on these non - equilibrium dynamics came from the study of oversimplified theories such as 1 + 1 dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) .",
    "indeed , phenomena like the light - cone spreading of correlations @xcite , the linear increase of entanglement entropy @xcite and the structure of revivals in finite systems @xcite have been first discovered in cft , later generalised to more realistic models and even verified in experiments ( see @xcite for the experimental measure of the light - cone spreading of correlations )",

    "in order to understand the generality and the limits of this approach , we parallel the analytic cft calculations with some exact numerical computations for the harmonic chain . the non - equilibrium evolution of the negativity in cft , but for different quench protocols , has also been considered in refs .",

    "the system is prepared in the ground state @xmath2 of the hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "the quantum quench consists in a sudden ( instantaneous ) change of a parameter in the hamiltonian @xmath3 at a given time that we set as @xmath4 .",
    "thus , the unitary evolution of @xmath2 is [ state t>0 ] | ( t ) = e^- h t | _ 0 .",

    "it is clear from the figure that the main difference compared to the case of adjacent interval is that there is an initial region for @xmath257 in which there is no entanglement and no correlations ( we recall that the initial correlation length is @xmath258 , so that the initial entanglement is very small ) . then at time equal to @xmath259 the entanglement starts growing linearly , reaches a maximum and then decreases almost linearly .",
    "again , this behaviour is compatible with the quasi - particle interpretation and also the power law relaxation for large times can be understood in terms of slow modes . even in the case of disjoint intervals , we have studied the revivals .",

    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]    conversely , a very interesting phenomenon can be observed by looking at very short times after the entanglement starts growing .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig n2 l200l200manyd ] , where in the top panels we show the mutual information and the negativity as function of time for different distances between the two intervals . as before",
    ", the behaviour is very reminiscent of the cft prediction . in the panel ( c ) of the same figure , we show in the same plot the negativity and the mutual information for fixed @xmath261 and looking closely to the time when the entanglement starts growing it is already clear that something is happening .",
    "for this reason in the panel ( d ) we zoom close to the point @xmath260 and we highlight a very peculiar phenomenon : while the mutual information starts moving from zero slightly before @xmath260 the negativity starts slightly after @xmath260 . the behaviour of the mutual information is simply the exponential tails of the correlations outside the light - cone , but the behaviour of the negativity is new . from the figure , it is evident that increasing the total system size @xmath25 ( at fixed ratios @xmath262 and @xmath236 ) this phenomenon disappears in such a way to recover the cft result and the quasi - particle interpretation of the evolution in the continuum limit . as a consequence , this remarkable phenomenon is a lattice effect and so can not have an explanation in terms of quasi - particles , but it would be interesting to understand its precise origin . in a suggestive way , and in analogy with the famous sudden death of entanglement @xcite ( which will be discussed below )",

    "[ fig n2 l200l100manyd ] we consider again the mutual information ( a ) and the negativity ( b ) for various distances between two intervals of different lengths @xmath249 .",
    "the behaviour is in perfect agreement with the cft prediction with a linear growth starting at @xmath259 up to @xmath263 , followed by a plateau lasting @xmath264 , then a linear decrease up to @xmath265 and finally a power - law approach to zero . in the panel ( c )",
    "we report on the same plot the negativity and the mutual information , observing again the fingerprints of the late birth , which are straightforwardly confirmed by zooming for times close to @xmath259 , as done in panel ( d ) .     of disjoint intervals after global quenches with different evolution hamiltonians .",
    "here @xmath233 , @xmath266 and @xmath230 , while for @xmath193 we have @xmath190 or @xmath267 . the velocity @xmath172 is given by eq .",
    "( [ vmax def ] ) . ]      in this section we briefly discuss what happens when the time evolution is governed by a massive hamiltonian .",
    "this is elucidated with an example in fig .",
    "[ fig n2 massive ] where we report and compare critical ( @xmath190 ) and noncritical ( @xmath267 ) evolution of the logarithmic negativity always starting from @xmath230 . the data are reported against @xmath181 ( @xmath172 is given by eq .",
    "( [ vmax def ] ) ) . also in this case , the data are perfectly compatible with the quasi - particle picture , but we notice an interesting effect . the slope of the negativity changes as a function of time as a consequence of the entanglement carried by slower quasi - particles which in the case of the non - critical evolution have a larger weight because of the non - monotonicity of @xmath268 in eq .",
    "( [ vk ] ) .",
    "however , also this phenomenon does not come as a surprise and indeed it was already observed for the entanglement entropy of a single interval following a quench in the ising / xy chain @xcite .    ) . here",
    "@xmath190 and different @xmath201 are chosen : @xmath269 , @xmath270 and @xmath271 ( top , middle and bottom panels respectively ) .",
    "the sudden death of the logarithmic negativity happens for later time as @xmath25 increases and as @xmath201 decreases .",
    ", scaledwidth=100.0% ]      a final important feature of the logarithmic negativity @xmath104 is the so called _ sudden death _ of entanglement .",
    "the phenomenon has been first introduced for other entanglement measures @xcite , but it has been observed also for the negativity .",
    "for example , in the case of the harmonic chain at thermal equilibrium at some finite @xmath272 , it consists into the exact vanishing of @xmath104 for temperatures larger than a critical value as discussed also in @xcite , where it was emphasised its lattice nature and its absence in the quantum field theory description of the continuum limit . in the case of quench",
    ", we have already seen that the entanglement and the mutual information of two intervals are vanishing for large enough time in the cft , but this is an independent phenomenon compared to the sudden death .    in order to show the true sudden death of @xmath104 after a global quench",
    ", we report in fig .",
    "[ fig sudden death ] the negativity and we compare it to the mutual information for several initial frequencies @xmath269 , @xmath270 and @xmath271 and for several configurations of the intervals",
    ". it is evident that in all cases , while the mutual information stays finite at any time , the negativity @xmath104 drops suddenly to zero after some time .",
    "thus , the sudden death is a peculiarity of the entanglement and it is not reflected by the correlations ( quantified by the mutual information ) which are always a smooth function of the time .",
    "let us now discuss how this phenomenon depends on the various parameters .",
    "first , we notice that increasing the system size and keeping the ratios between the various lengths fixed , the sudden death time increases and , when the system and the subsystems are large enough , the sudden death does not occur anymore .",
    "this agrees with the expectation that the sudden death is a lattice effect .",
    "second we observe that the sudden death depends also on the initial frequency @xmath201 : increasing @xmath201 , the sudden death time decreases .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that , when the revival takes place , the entanglement appears again , but this is not at all surprising .",
    "we studied the evolution of the entanglement negativity following a quantum quench .",
    "we considered the case of a conformal evolution starting from a boundary state .",
    "first , for the sake of completeness , we reviewed the results for the entanglement entropy and the mutual information of an arbitrary number of ( adjacent or disjoint ) intervals within the path integral approach of refs .",
    "then we moved to the calculation of the negativity between two adjacent and disjoint intervals which are respectively given by eqs .",
    "( [ neg 2adj t - dep cft ] ) and ( [ logneg n2disj cft t - dep ] ) . the applicability and generality of these results have been checked against exact numerical calculations for the same quantities in the harmonic chain .",
    "one of the main results of this study is that the quasi - particle picture @xcite for the time dependence of the entanglement after a global quantum quench applies also to the negativity between two intervals : this is a remarkable and non - trivial property .",
    "we also highlight two peculiar lattice effects : the late birth of entanglement and its sudden death .",
    "the former one consists in the fact that the negativity starts growing slightly after the time predicted by the quasi - particle picture , a delay which vanishes in the continuum limit .",
    "the latter one , instead , is well known and concerns the exact vanishing of the negativity after some given large time ( but before revivals take place ) .",
    "we investigated how these effects depend on the quench parameters .",
    "while we draw a quite complete picture for the evolution of the negativity after a quantum quench , there are still some questions deserving further investigations .",
    "first , it would be very interesting to obtain analytical forms in the harmonic chain for the evolution of the various entanglement measures ( entropy , mutual information , and negativity ) in analogy to what done in refs .",
    "@xcite for the ising model ( but only for entropy and mutual information ) .",
    "however , we should stress that there are still no analytic results for the entanglement entropy of bosonic models even in the ground state , in contrast with the many results available for free fermion thanks to toeplitz matrix techniques @xcite .",
    "obtaining such analytic predictions is a prerequisite in order to tackle the quench problem .",
