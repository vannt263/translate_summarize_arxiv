    "a typical inverse problem for ( [ eq : wave ] ) is the following one : from an _ observation _ or _",
    "measurement _ of the normal derivative @xmath27 in @xmath28 on the sub - domain @xmath29 , we want to recover a solution @xmath22 of the boundary value problem ( [ eq : wave ] ) such that its normal derivative coincides with the observation on @xmath29 .",
    "we denote by @xmath30 the normal derivative of @xmath22 on @xmath7 . introducing the operator @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 and",
    "the hilbert space @xmath33 defined by ( [ refz])-([eq : pseta ] ) , the problem is reformulated as : @xmath34    from the unique continuation property for ( [ eq : wave ] ) , if the set @xmath29 satisfies some geometric conditions and if @xmath27 is a restriction to @xmath29 of a normal derivative of a solution of ( [ eq : wave ] ) , then the problem is well - posed in the sense that the state @xmath22 corresponding to the pair @xmath35 is unique . in view of the unavoidable uncertainties on the data @xmath27 ( coming from measurements , numerical approximations , etc )",
    ", the problem ( [ ip ] ) needs to be relaxed . in this respect ,",
    "the most natural ( and widely used in practice ) approach consists in introducing the following extremal problem ( of least - squares type ) @xmath36 since @xmath22 is uniquely and fully determined from @xmath37 and the data @xmath38 . here",
    "the constraint @xmath39 in @xmath28 is relaxed ; however , if @xmath27 is a restriction to @xmath29 of the normal derivative of a solution of ( [ eq : wave ] ) , then problems ( [ extremal_problem ] ) and ( [ ip ] ) coincide .",
    "a minimizing sequence for @xmath40 in @xmath41 is easily defined in term of the solution of an auxiliary adjoint problem .",
    "apart from a possible low decrease of the sequence near extrema , the main drawback , when one wants to prove the convergence of a discrete approximation is that , it is not in general possible to minimize over a discrete subspace of @xmath42 subject to the equality ( in @xmath43 ) @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , a classical trick consists first in discretizing the functional @xmath40 and the system ( [ eq : wave ] ) ; this raises the issue of uniform coercivity property ( typically here some uniform discrete observability inequality for the adjoint solution ) of the discrete functional with respect to the approximation parameter .",
    "as far as we know , this delicate issue has received answers only for specific and somehow academic situations ( uniform cartesian approximation of @xmath1 , constant coefficients in ( [ eq : wave ] ) , etc ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "more recently , a different method to solve inverse type problems like ( [ ip ] ) has emerged and use the so called luenberger type observers : roughly , this method consists in defining , from the observation on @xmath29 , an auxiliary boundary value problem whose solution possesses the same asymptotic behavior in time than the solution of ( [ eq : wave ] ) : the use of the reversibility of the hyperbolic equation then allows to reconstruct the initial data @xmath38 .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "however , for the same reasons , from a numerically point of view , these methods require to prove uniform discrete observability properties .",
    "in a series of works , klibanov and co - workers use different approaches to solve inverse problems ( we refer to @xcite and the references therein ) : they advocate in particular the quasi - reversibility method which reads as follows : for any @xmath45 , find @xmath46 the solution of @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes a hilbert space subset of @xmath43 so that @xmath49 for all @xmath50 and @xmath45 is a tikhonov like parameter which ensures the well - posedness .",
    "we refer for instance to @xcite where the lateral cauchy problem for the wave equation with non constant diffusion is addressed within this method .",
    "remark that ( [ fv ] ) can be viewed as a least - squares problem since the solution @xmath51 minimizes over @xmath48 the functional @xmath52 .",
    "eventually , if @xmath27 is the normal derivative of a restriction to @xmath29 of a solution of ( [ eq : wave ] ) , the corresponding @xmath51 converges in @xmath43 toward to the solution of ( [ ip ] ) as @xmath53 .",
    "there , unlike in problem ( [ extremal_problem ] ) , the unknown is the state variable @xmath22 itself ( as it is natural for elliptic equations ) so that any standard numerical methods based on a conformal approximation of the space @xmath48 together with appropriate observability inequalities allow to obtain a convergent approximation of the solution . in particular , there is no need to prove discrete observability inequalities .",
    "we refer to the book @xcite .",
    "we also mention @xcite where a similar technique has been used recently to solve the inverse obstacle problem associated to the laplace equation , which consists in finding an interior obstacle from boundary cauchy data .    in the spirit of the works @xcite",
    ", we explore the direct resolution of the optimality conditions associated to the extremal problem ( [ extremal_problem ] ) , without tikhonov parameter while keeping @xmath22 as the unknown of the problem .",
    "this strategy , which avoids any iterative process , has been successfully applied in the close context of the exact controllability of ( [ eq : wave ] ) in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the idea is to take into account the state constraint @xmath44 with a lagrange multiplier .",
    "this allows to derive explicitly the optimality system associated to ( [ extremal_problem ] ) in term of an elliptic mixed formulation and therefore reformulate the original problem .",
    "well - posedness of such new formulation is related to a unique continuation property for the hyperbolic equation ( [ eq : wave ] ) .    from the observation @xmath27",
    ", we also address the simultaneous reconstruction problem of the source term @xmath37 and the solution @xmath22 : @xmath54 where @xmath55 solves ( [ eq : wave ] ) . without additional assumption on @xmath20 , the pair @xmath55 solution of ( [ ipf ] )",
    "is not unique : consider for instance a source term @xmath37 supported in a set which is near @xmath56 : from the finite propagation of the solution , the source @xmath37 will not affect the solution @xmath22 on @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , a result of yamamoto and zhang in @xcite asserts that the uniqueness holds true if the source takes the form @xmath57 , where the smooth time part @xmath58 is given and the spatial part @xmath59 is a @xmath60 function .",

    "the outline is as follow . in section [ recovering_y ]",
    ", we consider the least - squares problem ( [ p ] ) and reconstruct the solution of the hyperbolic equation from a partial observation localized on a subset @xmath29 of @xmath62 .",
    "for that , in section [ sec2_direct ] , we associate to ( [ p ] ) the equivalent mixed formulation ( [ eq : mf ] ) which relies on the optimality conditions of the problem . assuming that @xmath29 satisfies the classical geometric optic condition ( hypothesis 1 , see ( [ iobs ] ) )",
    ", we then show the well - posedness of this mixed formulation , in particular , we check the babuska - brezzi inf - sup condition ( see theorem [ th : mf ] ) .",
    "interestingly , we also derive in section [ sec2_dual ] an equivalent dual extremal problem , which reduces the determination of the state @xmath22 to the minimization of a strongly elliptic functional with respect to the lagrange multiplier . in section [ recovering_y_mu ] ,",
    "we use the uniqueness result ( * ? ? ?",

    "the strong convergence of the approximation @xmath63 is proved as the discretization parameter @xmath64 tends to zero . in particular , we discuss the discrete inf - sup property of the mixed formulation .",
    "we present numerical experiments in section [ sec_experiment ] for @xmath65 and @xmath66 , an check the robustness and convergence of the approximations in agreement with the theoretical part .",
