    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking ( s@xmath0sb ) is accepted to occur in low energy hadronic physics",
    ". another important feature of hadronic physics , suggested by the spectroscopy of hadrons , by lattice simulations and by models of confinement is scalar confinement .",
    "however s@xmath0sb and scalar confinement are apparently conflicting , since the first requires a chiral invariant coupling to the quarks , like the vector coupling of qcd .",
    "we address a recent quest of bjorken @xcite , `` how are the many disparate methods of describing hadrons which are now in use related to each other and to first principles of qcd ? '' .",
    "although the vector confinement of quarks is not yet ruled out @xcite , here we try to solve this old chiral symmetry versus scalar confinement conflict of hadronic physics , which remained open for many years .",
    "in this paper we explore scalar confinement from the perspective of chiral symmetry breaking . in section [ sec : motivation ]",
    "we motivate the importance of both s@xmath0sb and scalar confinement .",
    "we show these features of hadronic physics to have some subtle weaknesses that we capitalize to construct a model .",
    "the potential used in our quark model ( qm ) is defined in section [ sec : potential ] .",
    "the self consistent mass gap equation for the quarks is derived in section [ sec : mass gap ] . in section [ sec : numerical ] we solve numerically the mass gap equation and calculate the quark condensate .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we present some conclusions .",
    "the qcd lagrangian is chiral invariant in the limit of vanishing quark masses .",
    "nambu and jona - lasinio showed that including chiral symmetry in fermionic systems provides a natural explanation for the small pion mass , which is much lighter than all the other isovector hadrons .",
    "because of this crucial fact the mechanism of s@xmath0sb is accepted to occur in low energy hadronic physics for the light flavors @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 .",
    "similarly to the vector ward identities in gauge symmetry , the axial ward identities constitute a powerful tool of chiral symmetry .",
    "the techniques of current algebra led to beautifully correct theorems , the partially conserved axial current ( pcac ) theorems .",
    "the different variants of qms are widely used as simplifications of qcd .",
    "they are convenient to study quark bound states and hadron scattering .",
    "recently @xcite we have shown these beautiful pcac theorems , like the weinberg theorem for @xmath5 scattering , to be reproduced by qms with s@xmath0sb .",
    "another important benefit of having s@xmath0sb in the qm is the reduced number of parameters .",
    "the mass gap equation generates a dynamical constituent quark mass , which is no longer an independent parameter , even for quarks with a vanishing current mass .",
    "the quark - quark , quark - antiquark , antiquark - antiquark potentials , and the quark - antiquark annihilation and creation interactions are all originated in the same chiral invariant bethe - salpeter kernel .",
    "therefore any qm for light quarks should comply with the s@xmath0sb . moreover the microscopic coupling of the quark to the confining interaction should include the vector coupling which is present in the quark - gluon vertex of qcd",
    ". however there is some evidence that a vector quark - quark potential is not sufficient to provide the expected scale of s@xmath0sb of the order of @xmath6 mev which is present both in the constituent quark mass and in the quark condensate .",
    "it was realized by adler @xcite that a linear confinement with vector couplings was not sufficient to provide the correct quark condensate .",
    "moreover the gluon propagator extracted from the lattice , when used in a one gluon exchange truncation of the quark mass gap equation , is not able to provide the expected quark condensate @xcite .",
    "this also happens with the gluon propagator extracted from the solution of truncated schwinger - dyson equations of qcd @xcite .",
    "importantly , these gluon propagators exhibit a non - perturbative mass . this mass should produce a meissner effect in yang - mills fields , and this is expected to produce a confining string for the quarks . here",
    "we will estimate the effect of the confining string on the quark condensate .",
    "on the other hand the confining potential for constituent quarks is probably scalar .",
    "we can learn much by comparing simply the spectrum of the hydrogen atom with the masses of all hadron families . in a perturbative qcd scenario ,",
    "the hadron spectroscopy would be dominated by the one gluon exchange , which is qualitatively similar to the one photon exchange interaction that explains in detail atomic physics .",
    "it turns out that all the hadronic families , say of mesons or baryons , with light or heavy flavors , show similar differences with the hydrogen spectrum .",
    "it is remarkable that the spin - orbit potential ( also called fine interaction in atomic physics ) turns out to be suppressed in hadronic spectra since it is smaller than the spin - spin potential ( hyperfine interaction ) .",
    "this constitutes an evidence of non - perturbative qcd .",
    "another evidence of non - perturbative qcd is present in the angular and radial excitations of hadrons , which fit linear trajectories in regge plots , and suggest a long range , probably linear , confining potential for the quarks .",
    "this led henriques , kellett and moorhouse @xcite to develop a qm where a short range vector potential and a long range scalar potential partly cancel the spin - orbit contribution .",
    "the short range potential is coulomb - like ( inspired in the one gluon exchange ) and its quark vertex has a vector coupling structure @xmath7 .",
    "the long range potential has scalar coupling @xmath8 and is a linear potential @xcite .",
    "the same scalar confinement picture is extracted from lattice simulations . in quenched lattices which simulate the quark - antiquark potential in the heavy quark limit , the pattern of spin - spin , tensor , and spin - orbit interactions is compatible with a scalar confinement @xcite .",
    "moreover the presently favored confinement picture in the literature is the flux tube , or string picture , with tension @xmath9 mev / fm .",
    "quantum mechanics suggests that a thin string , in its ground - state , should be a scalar object @xcite .",
    "only higher energy excitations of the string would have angular momentum .",
    "this was capitalized by isgur and paton in the flux tube model @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will assume the quarks are coupled to a scalar object which provides a linear confinement . on top of",
    "that we want this coupling to use , as a microscopic building block , the vector gluon - quark which is present in qcd .",
    "notice that to get a lorentz scalar coupling a simple one gluon vertex is not enough .",
    "the coupling needs at least two vertices .",
    "the simplest way to achieve this is to have the string emitting two effective gluons that couple to the same quark line .",
    "this double vertex , coupling the string to a quark line via two intermediate gluon propagators , is presented in fig .",
    "[ loopvertex ] .",
    "effectively this double vertex is similar to the vertices that couple a quark to a gluon ladder in the soft pomeron models @xcite .",
    "it is also related to the light quark vertex in the heavy - light quark bound states studied in the local gauge coordinate @xcite .",
    "such a double vertex was also introduced in the coupling of short strings to quarks @xcite . in the cumulant expansion formalism int terms of gluon correlators @xcite",
    "this means the quark - antiquark coupling will be dominated by four gluon correlators .",
    "in this section we construct the simplest possible coupling , that simulates that of a quark line with a scalar string using two vector couplings as building blocks .",
    "the most general coupling of this kind is presented in fig .",
    "[ loopvertex ] and it is simply read , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the dirac structure of the fermion - gluon interaction and @xmath12 the usual color interaction @xmath13 .",
    "we denote the quark propagator by @xmath14 and the gluon propagator by @xmath15 .",
    "finally @xmath16 represents the coupling of the gluon pair to the string .    to get the coupling of the string to a light quark",
    ", we follow the coupling obtained in the heavy - light quark system , computed in the local coordinate gauge @xcite .",
    "this model interpolates between the heavy - light meson in the local gauge and the effective qm .",
    "so , for the dirac structure of the quark - gluon sub - vertices @xmath11 we have @xmath17 matrices , which is also compatible with the coulomb gauge .    in the color sector , as already stated , the coupling of the same sub - vertices has a @xmath18 structure , where @xmath19 are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "the remaining sub - vertex includes the coupling of two color octets , see fig .",
    "[ string color ] .",
    "the string is also a colored object ; it contains a flux of colorelectric field . for a scalar coupling , which is symmetric",
    ", we use the symmetric structure function @xmath20 defined by @xmath21    this will result in a color contribution for the effective vertex of @xmath22 in qms the string usually couples to the quark line with a @xmath18 . in our case",
    "it couples with two @xmath18 , one for each sub - vertex .",
    "but as we can see from ( [ color factor ] ) the effective result is the same .",
    "the gluon propagators and the different sub - vertices result in a distribution in the loop momentum @xmath23 . here",
    "different choices would be possible .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the relative momentum @xmath24 flows equally in the two effective gluon lines .",
    "we also remark that the distribution in @xmath23 is normalized to unity once the correct string tension is included in the relative potential @xmath25 .",
    "this amounts to consider that the momentum @xmath23 distribution is a dirac delta @xmath26    if we summarize the above assumptions in a formula the loop vertex that will be used is @xmath27    the equal - time approximation , which is standard in qms , allows the computation of the double vertex as a functional of the running quark mass @xmath28 . the quark mass will be computed self - consistently in the next sections .",
    "we decompose the fermion propagator in the usual particle and antiparticle propagators @xmath29 where the quark energy projectors are @xmath30 and where @xmath31 and @xmath32 is the chiral angle , a convenient function for algebraic and numerical computations .",
    "the energy loop integral can be easily calculated , @xmath33 @xmath34    finally , using the dirac delta distribution for the remaining integrals over the three momentum @xmath35 , and summing in color indices , we get the following effective vertex , @xmath36 in the remainder of the paper we will always assume @xmath37 .",
    "( [ vertex result ] ) shows that the double vertex actually solves the problem of matching chiral symmetry breaking and scalar confinement . in the chiral limit of a vanishing quark mass ,",
    "the effective vertex @xmath38 is proportional to the @xmath39 and is therefore chiral invariant as it should be , whereas in the heavy quark limit , @xmath40 is simply a scalar vertex .",
    "the gell - mann matrix @xmath41 provides the usual color vector coupling as expected in a qm .",
    "we anticipate that the dynamical generation of a quark mass will also generate a scalar coupling for light quarks , and this results in an effective vertex , including a chiral invariant vertex @xmath42 and the standard scalar vertex @xmath43",
    ".    the dependence in the relative momentum must comply with the linear confinement which is derived from the string picture , @xmath44 where @xmath9 mev / fm is the string constant and @xmath45 is the algebraic color factor defined in eq .",

    "we want to determine the constituent quark mass @xmath52 solving the self consistent mass gap equation . to compute the self energy in this model , using the effective string potential which couples to the quark line with double vertices",
    ", we have to deal with the three loop diagram of fig . [ massgapfig ] . keeping in mind that the two double vertex loops are already simplified .",
    "technically other diagrams , with crossed gluon legs , could exist but we assume that this is the dominant diagram .        the mass gap equation can be much simplified in the spin formalism .",
