    "the current study was undertaken to solidify our knowledge of chemical and isotopic stratification of calcium in chemically peculiar ( cp ) stars of the upper main sequence .",
    "we hope such knowledge will lead to an improved understanding of the complex physical processes taking place in the atmospheres of these stars .    previous work ( cf .",
    "cowley and hubrig 2005 , henceforth paper i ) has demonstrated clearly the presence of rare isotopes of calcium in stars as different as the field hzb star feige 86 ( @xmath4k ) and przybylski s star ( hd 101065 , @xmath5k ) .",
    "lines of the ca ii infrared triplet ( irt ) have easily measurable isotope shifts , very nearly 0.20   between @xmath1ca and @xmath0ca for all three lines ( nrtershuser , et al .",
    "the large shifts arise because of the unusual nature of the 3d orbitals of the ground term of the irt ; they have collapsed below the 4p subshell .",
    "other ca ii lines show far smaller isotopic shifts , of the order of milliangstroms .    in a few cases ,",
    "e.g. the hgmn star hr 7143 ( castelli and hubrig 2004 ) , the isotope - sensitive lines appear both symmetrical , and shifted entirely to the wavelengths of the rare isotope , @xmath1ca .",
    "this isotope comprises only some 0.2% of terrestrial calcium .",
    "ryabchikova ( 2005 ) and her coworkers find that in roap stars the cores of the profiles indicate @xmath1ca , but the wings are arguably produced by the common isotope @xmath0ca .",
    "if only the cores of the isotope - sensitive lines are shifted , the observations may be reproduced by a model with a thin layer of the rare heavy calcium isotope . in this case",
    ", the relative amount of the exotic species , in terms of a column density above optical depth unity , could be quite small  far smaller than if the bulk of the line absorption were due to @xmath1ca .",
    "it is important to know which , if either , of these scenarios is dominant .",
    "we have examined several line profiles in some detail for seven stars .",
    "the following discussion is based on several possible models , with and without stratification . in the former case , we computed profiles based on both elemental and elemental plus isotopic stratification . automated as well as trial and",
    "error methods were used .",
    "details of all models and techniques considered would not be appropriate here .",
    "we present an eclectic resum .",
    "specific details are available on request from crc .",
    "it is generally accepted that the outer layers of cp stars are chemically differentiated from their bulk composition . the mechanism responsible for this separation ( michaud 1970 ) is capable of producing differentiation _ within _ the photosphere , or line - forming regions of these stars .",
    "such separation is now widely referred to as _ stratification _",
    "dworetsky 2004 ) .",
    "early indications of the need for vertical , chemical or density structures that depart from a classical one - dimensional , chemically homogeneous atmospheric structure were described by babcock ( 1958 ) , and analyzed in some detail in a series of papers by babel ( cf . babel 1994 ) .",
    "the most striking indications of stratification are in the cores of the ca ii resonance lines , particularly the k - line .",
    "babel ( 1992 ) proposed a wind model with an abundance profile that reproduced the sharp , deep cores of the h- and k - lines ( see his fig .",
    "4 ) .    cowley ,",
    "hubrig & kamp ( 2006 ) presented a short atlas of k - line cores in cp and normal stars .",
    "they also showed ( cf .",
    "their  6 ) that an ad hoc modification of the temperature distribution would also give cores similar to those illustrated in their paper .",
    "a sharp drop in the _ overall _ atmospheric density in a chemically homogeneous atmosphere would also produce sharp k - line cores . however , work by ryabchikova and her collaborators ( e.g. ryabchikova , kochukhov & bagnulo 2008 , henceforth , rkb ) show different stratification patterns for different elements , that exclude models with chemical homogeneity .    leblanc & monin ( 2004 ) discuss calculations somewhat similar to those of babel , though without a wind .",
    "they also obtain stratification profiles similar to those which reproduce observations .",
    "there are no models of stellar atmospheres with elemental stratification built in from first principles , and most researchers have used an empirical approach .",
    "while babel s work focused on the strong ca ii k - line , subsequent stratification studies have employ various lines , of more than one ionization stage .",
    "strong and weak lines were used , including the irt lines .",
    "kochukhov , et al .",
    "( 2006 , henceforth ktr ) derive stratification parameters by a `` regularized solution of the vertical inversion problem '' ( vip ) .",
    "they apply the technique to the magnetic cp star hr 5623 ( hd 133792 ) .",
    "the sophistication of the method notwithstanding , vip lacked a significant generality in practice .",
    "ktr first _ fixed _",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , and used them to derive calculated spectra .",
    "these fundamental parameters also affect the basic observed minus calculated values used to obtain the stratification profiles . _",
    "thus , an error in @xmath2 or @xmath3 could be reflected in erroneous stratification parameters .",
    "_ in principle , the difference between observed and calculated spectrum should consider all relevant parameters _ including _ those specifically describing the stratification .",
    "we discuss the model for hr 5623 below , and conclude that the model parameters are not easy to fix for this star .",
    "ryabchikova , leone , and kochukhov ( 2005 ) and subsequent papers by these workers describe the code ddafit , which is based on a limited set of 4 parameters describing the stratification .    both ddafit and the vip method derive stratification profiles from a comparison of the observed and calculated spectra .",
    "if applied to any single line profile , ddafit would be similar to our method ( cf .",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 below ) .",
    "ddafit does assume a sharp boundary between domains with different isotopic compositions , while our functions smooth over these boundaries .",
    "ddafit automatically adjusts its parameters to achieve an optimum fit with the help of a levenberg - marquardt routine ( kochukhov 2007 ) .    in two previous papers ( cowley , et al .",
    "2007 , henceforth , paper ii , cowley & hubrig 2008 , henceforth paper iii ) , we used stratification profiles for calcium based on an analytical function , @xmath8 , and four parameters , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and in an obvious notation , the abundance @xmath13 in the deepest photosphere :    @xmath14.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath15 ; the abundance at any depth , @xmath16 , is @xmath17 .",
    "the negative sign is taken for @xmath18 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : strats ] ) .",
    "we used atlas 9 models , as implemented and described by sbordone et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to obtain @xmath19 .",
    "pressures , opacities , and line profiles were obtained with michigan software described in previous publications .    we have used both a trial - and - error method and a least squares minimization based on the ( downhill ) simplex routine umpol from the imsl ( 1998 ) library .      in this work ,",
    "we have tried to avoid weak lines , preferring the strong lines of ca ii , either the k - line , or lines of the irt . in some stars",
    ", the resonance lines of sr ii show the characteristics of stratification ( paper iii ) .",
    "strong lines have several advantages over weaker ones .",
    "first , the effects of stratification are much larger , as may be seen by comparing figs . 7 and 9 of paper iii for the strong ca ii lines @xmath203933 and 8542 with the fig .",
    "14 , where we were at some pains to show the effect of stratification on the subordinate sr ii line , @xmath214162 .",
    "much of the discrepancy between observed and calculated weak and intermediate - strength lines is in the line depths .",
    "line depths have subtle dependences on many factors , instrumental , model dependent ( @xmath2 , microturbulence , @xmath22 , etc . ) , and atomic ( @xmath23-values , damping , hfs ) .",
    "one may readily get a fit for any individual line depth by adjusting one or more of these parameters . by contrast , the observed profiles of stronger lines are less subject to perturbations by noise , blends , and the instrumental profiles .",
    "we know of no reasonable adjustment of parameters that could reconcile the observed , anomalous cores with those calculated for the strong ca ii k - line using a classical model .",
    "however , the generally - accepted stratification models can fit these strong - line profiles .",
    "it has been known for decades that isotopic anomalies occur in the atmospheres of cp stars ( see the review by cowley , hubrig , and castelli , 2008 ) .    these anomalies , like the chemical peculiarities , are not believed to reflect the bulk compositions of the stars .",
    "while it is assumed that the isotopic separations are caused by the same kinds of forces that give rise to the overall chemical peculiarities , detailed explanations of the anomalies remain to be worked out .    in a few cases ,",
    "the isotope separation mechanism has been so efficient that the material remaining in the line - forming regions is virtually isotopically pure .",
    "a canonical case has been mercury in @xmath24 lupi , which is some 99%-pure @xmath25hg .",
    "proffitt , et al .",
    "( 1999 ) give references and an extensive discussion .",
    "various efforts have been made to establish stratification of mercury .",
    "the even - a isotopes of mercury are well separated in wavelength in certain sharp - lined spectra ( cf .",
    "woolf and lambert 1999 ) , but we know of no convincing studies showing different formation strata for mercury isotopes",
    ".    in the case of stars showing anomalously strong lines of @xmath26he , bohlender ( 2005 ) has concluded that the lighter isotope is in layers above those with the normal isotope @xmath27he .",
    "he finds that the stark widths are systematically smaller for the lighter isotope , indicating that it is formed in higher regions of the atmospheres with lower gas pressures .",
    "ryabchikova ( 2005 ) and her coworkers used models with the heaviest isotopes ( @xmath1ca and/or @xmath28ca ) concentrated above @xmath29 .",
    "the common @xmath0ca dominates the deeper layers . in the deepest layers ,",
    "the ca / h - ratio can exceed the solar value by more than two orders of magnitude ( hr 5105 , hr 7575 ) .",
    "we avoid an abrupt transition in the isotopic mix by introducing a second function , @xmath9 , to simulate a layer rich in the heavy isotope ( or isotopes ) .",
    "again , @xmath30",
    ". this function places the center of a cloud of exotic calcium at a depth @xmath31 .",
    "the function @xmath9 is defined to be unity for @xmath32 .",
    "on either side of this domain , the function declines rapidly to zero . by an appropriate choice of parameters ,",

    "the simplex fits tend to push the centroid of the cloud very high in the model .",
    "this tendency had already been noted by ryabchikova ( 2005 )",
    ". additional study of this problem requires a hyperextended atmosphere including non - lte , which we leave for future work .      in a stratified atmosphere",
    "there is no single @xmath13 ratio . as a substitute one may consider integral column densities , for some `` equivalent '' column length , @xmath39 .",
    "we adopt the following , somewhat arbitrary definition .",
    "@xmath40    the integrals are taken from the smallest optical depth of our models to the largest , or from @xmath41 to 1.4 .",
    "the @xmath42-values are calculated with the help of the model atmosphere , and the relevant stratification profile , @xmath8 or @xmath9 . with this definition",
    ", we can show that very different column densities of @xmath1ca arise in the models with and without isotopic stratification .",
    "a related column density is that of all massive particles . in an obvious notation , @xmath43    from these relations",
    ", we may make rough intercomparisons of elemental abundances in stratified and unstratified atmospheres .      in order to allow for variable relative abundances of individual calcium isotopes",
    ", we often adjusted the log(@xmath23 ) values for the irt lines independently . since the line absorption coefficient involves the _ product _ of the abundance and oscillator strength , increasing the @xmath44- or @xmath23-value for a given line is equivalent to increasing the abundance for that line .",
    "the elemental and atomic data input to the calculation includes a _ provisional _ ( note the prime ) ratio @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , ( massive particles ) .",
    "when a good line fit is achieved , the provisional @xmath45 is the optimum abundance ratio _ for that particular line , provided the assumed @xmath23-value is also the adopted one_. if the @xmath23-value differs from that adopted , the abundance that corresponds to a line fit must be modified .",
    "logarithmically ,    @xmath47    in this work we have only assumed the presence of @xmath0ca and @xmath1ca . in some cases , better fits to the observations could have been obtained by including intermediate isotopes , but this has not been done for the present study .",
