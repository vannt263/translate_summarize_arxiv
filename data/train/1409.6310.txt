    "there has been much work in the last 10 years deriving gauged supergravity theories in four dimensions from string theory and m - theory .",
    "such theories have applications to string phenomenology , holography and black hole physics .",
    "the canonical vacua in @xmath0 gauged supergravity are the @xmath0 ads@xmath1 vacua ; the equations for such vacua are straightforward to derive , one can find recent discussions in @xcite which we build upon in the current work .",
    "the essential step in gauging supergravity theories is to charge the gravitino under isometries of the vector scalar manifold @xmath2 and the hypermultiplet scalar manifold @xmath3",
    ". we will consider abelian gaugings in this work so that the only other charged fields are the hypermultiplets .",
    "certainly one should understand these global symmetries before making them local and as luck would have it , the symmetries of very special khler manifolds and quaternionic khler manifolds in the image of a c - map have been studied in great depth some time ago by de wit and van proeyen @xcite . in the current work",
    "we utilize these descriptions of symmetric quaternionic khler manifolds to compute the killing prepotentials , a key ingredient in constructing gauged supergravity theories",
    ".    an interesting feature of quaternionic khler manifolds is that the curvature forms need not be exactly invariant under a given killing vector but may transform under the @xmath4 holonomy group .",
    "we find that in order to have @xmath0 ads@xmath1 vacua , one must gauge along an isometry @xmath5 which induces such an @xmath4 transformation . in the language of the text below , this implies there is a non - trivial compensator @xmath6 .",
    "notably , the vector fields which generate the heisenberg algebra do not generate such transformations and are thus not sufficient for the existence of @xmath0 ads@xmath1 vacua .",
    "nonetheless there are large numbers of @xmath7 ads@xmath1 vacua found by gauging the heisenberg algebra @xcite .",
    "we also analyze the conditions for quarter bps black hole horizons of the form ads@xmath8 where @xmath9 is a riemann surface of genus @xmath10 .",
    "for the same vacua but in fi - gauged supergravity , the algebraic bps equations have been solved @xcite and the entropy found to be related to the famous quartic invariant .",
    "we repeat this analysis for abelian gaugings of hypermultiplets , and again find that the quartic invariant plays a prominent role .",
    "the work of @xcite considered homogeneous quaternionic manifolds which lie in the image of a c - map .",
    "this later condition is tantamount to the fact that they arise in three dimensions as the moduli space of vector in a dimensional reduction from four dimensions .",
    "in particular the symmetries of such manifolds were classified .",
    "we build on this work while just considering the symmetric quaternionic khler manifolds . while all homogeneous spaces are cosets , the condition of being symmetric means that all possible symmetries are realized and they form a semi - simple lie algebra .",
    "we add a conceptual point to the analysis of @xcite ; the so - called _ hidden _ isometries must act symplectically on the base special khler manifold , this is not at all evident from the formulae of de wit and van proeyen . by restricting to symmetric spaces we are able to demonstrate this explicitly",
    "although generalizing this to the homogeneous case is an interesting future step .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review aspects of @xmath0 ads@xmath1 vacua as well as quarter bps black hole horizons . in section 3",
    "we review aspects of special khler geometry which we will need . in section 4",
    "we present the symmetries of symmetric quaternionic khler manifolds . in section 5",
    "we compute the prepotentials and compensators for all symmetries on these quaternionic khler manifolds . in section 6",
    "we discuss the constraints on the embedding tensor from locality and in section 7 we discuss two examples from m - theory which utilize @xmath11 .",
    "* note added * : as this paper was being prepared for submission , we were made aware of a recent article @xcite which overlaps with our work .",
    "in particular they also compute the killing prepotentials associated to symmetric quaternionic khler manifolds .",
    "in this section we review some basic facts about gauged @xmath0 supergravity with @xmath12-vector multiplets and @xmath13-hypermultiplets .",
    "we then discuss the conditions for ads@xmath1 vacua with eight supercharges and ads@xmath8 vacua which preserve four supercharges .    the scalar kinetic terms respect a division into hyper - scalars @xmath14 and vector - scalars @xmath15 : _",

    "in general this can be neatly formulated in terms of the embedding tensor @xcite but since we will be restricting to abelian gaugings we find it clearer to merely include the magnetic killing vectors @xmath36 and magnetic killing prepotentials @xmath37 , we use the following notation for the symplectic vector of gauging parameters ^u = ^u , + k^u_,^x= ^x , + p^x_.    in section [ sec : gaugingconstraints ] we will enforce a particular set of constraints on these objects to ensure that there exists a symplectic frame where all the gaugings are electric @xcite . if one is willing to consider an arbitrary prepotential @xmath38 one could thus equally well consider solely electric gaugings from the outset but we will allow for magnetic gaugings and restrict the class of prepotentials @xmath38 which we consider .",

    "we will build upon the work of van proeyen and de wit @xcite where they classified isometries of particular quaternionic - khler manifolds but we will provide simplified formulae for these isometries which we consider more easily utilized in gauged supergravity , in particular we compute the compensators @xmath49 .",
