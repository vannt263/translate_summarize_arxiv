    "galaxies are one of the most important hierarchies composing the universe . for example , in order to understand the evolution of the universe and its structure , galaxies are often used as a measure of space - time in performing wide - field or deep surveys . in the field of observational cosmology , therefore , galaxies are indispensable units in the universe .",
    "what we should note about galaxies is , however , that galaxies have also been evolving along with the evolution of the universe .",
    "thus , correctly modeling the evolution of galaxies is essential in observational cosmology . at the same time , galaxies themselves are also interesting objects because many physical processes are involved in galaxy formation .",
    "however , since some processes such as star formation are still poorly understood , it has been challenging to understand galaxy formation . to attack this subject , correctly modeling galaxy formation is critical as well , particularly under the current situation that numerical hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation still have large uncertainties ( see , e.g. , *",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the purpose of this paper is to construct a better and more reliable model of galaxy formation aided by high resolution @xmath1-body simulations , which are well established in contrast to hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation , with quality high enough to be compared with recent high precision observations .",
    "it has been widely understood that the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model well describes the universe .",
    "recent high resolution observations such as those measuring anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background by the _ wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe _ @xcite and the type ia supernova ( sn ) rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed that the energy density in the universe is dominated by dark energy or the cosmological constant , and that gravity is dominated by the cdm .",
    "the large - scale structure of the universe has evolved from small density fluctuations existing in the early universe via gravitational instability . because the predicted amplitude of density fluctuations is monotonically increasing toward smaller scales , small - mass dark halos , which are virialized objects of dark matter , firstly collapse and then those of larger masses subsequently collapse swallowing the smaller dark halos .",
    "therefore , the formation of cosmological structure predicted by the cdm model is often called the hierarchical clustering .",
    "most baryonic processes , such as gas cooling and star formation , take place within dark halos because of the gravitational potential of dark matter . therefore , galaxy formation models must be constructed within the framework of hierarchical clustering as a natural consequence of the cdm model .",
    "along this line , semi - analytic ( sa ) modeling of galaxy formation has been developed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in most sa models , merging histories or _ merger trees _ of dark halos",
    "are realized by using a monte carlo method based on extended press - schechter ( eps ) models @xcite which provide mass functions of progenitor halos .",
    "the eps formalism is an extension of the press - schechter ( ps ) model of mass functions of dark halos @xcite , which are derived from the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations combined with a spherically symmetric collapse model to describe non - linear evolution of density fluctuations @xcite .",
    "considering density fluctuations within an overdense region which collapses later , mass functions of progenitor halos of a larger , later collapsing halo are obtained .",
    "sa models also include several important physical processes such as gas cooling , star formation , heating by sn explosions ( sn feedback ) and galaxy mergers , which take place within dark halos .",
    "moreover , to directly compare theoretical results with observations , a stellar population synthesis technique is usually incorporated . because we do not follow the dynamics related with these processes as hydrodynamical simulations , the computation is much faster .",
    "this means that we can explore a much larger space of parameters characterizing these processes , and therefore sa modeling is an important approach , complementary to hydrodynamical simulations in understanding the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "in addition to those galaxy formation processes , observations of high redshift galaxies suffer from several effects that are not intrinsic in galaxies .",
    "@xcite and @xcite considered absorption of emitted light from high redshift galaxies by intervening clouds @xcite .",
    "the latter work also took into account selection effects arising from cosmological dimming of surface brightness dependent on observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a new ingredient related to sn feedback has recently been introduced into an sa model by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ny04 ) for the first time .",
    "they considered dynamical response to starburst - induced gas removal from galaxies on the size and velocity dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , followed by a change in the depth of the gravitational potential well .",
    "they also showed that the model can successfully explain many aspects of photometric , structural and kinematical properties of dwarf ellipticals .",
    "this is called the mitaka model , and is the basis of the sa model we shall show in this paper .",
    "the ps model , however , has been recognized to be consistent with @xmath1-body simulations only within a factor of two @xcite .",
    "some sa models , therefore , use corrected mass functions based on high resolution @xmath1-body simulations @xcite instead of the ps model . @xcite used information on halo distribution from an @xmath1-body simulation and adapted their sa models , galform @xcite , in which an eps model is used .",
    "this method has the virtue , not only of allowing spatial distribution of galaxies to be followed , but also of resolution to low - mass halos at high redshift being freely set from the @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "unfortunately , we can not avoid the limitations of the ps model with these approaches , because the problems of eps formalism still remain .",
    "to bypass the limitations of eps formalism , hybrid sa models have been developed in which merger trees of dark halos directly taken from @xmath1-body simulations are used , while we have to carefully interpret any results from such hybrid models because of the limited numerical resolution . fortunately , currently available @xmath1-body simulations are of high enough resolution to resolve the effective jeans mass after the cosmic reionization . this kind of hybrid model can also be used to derive spatial distributions of galaxies .",
    "thus , combined with photometric properties , mock catalogs can be made for comparison with individual galaxy surveys , without any loss of sa model advantages .",
    "therefore , this approach provides strong tools with which to study galaxy formation .",
    "the pioneering work for this approach was carried out by @xcite . since then , their work has been substantially improved upon by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we have learned many things about the spatial clustering of galaxies , particularly of high redshift galaxies , from those models .",
    "however , as we shall show in this paper , those models suffer from limited numerical resolution of @xmath1-body simulations . as another direction to the extension of sa models with @xmath1-body simulations",
    ", we should note works by @xcite and @xcite , in which merging histories of _ subhalos _ in galaxy clusters are taken into account .",
    "this enables us to derive relationships between galaxy properties and spatial distribution in halos , such as the morphology - density relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we do not follow the merging histories of subhalos , but it would be worth including those in future .    in this paper , based on our previous work on the mitaka sa model ( ny04 ) and @xmath1-body simulations using a parallel adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code @xcite , we construct the _ numerical galaxy catalog _ ( @xmath0gc ) , which is an sa model combined with high resolution @xmath1-body simulations . as shown below , the mass resolution is high enough to resolve the jeans mass , and the size of the simulation box is also large enough to express a fair sample of the universe .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite , in which mass functions of dark halos are presented , to see how powerful this amr @xmath1-body code is . as a first paper in a series of @xmath0gc , here we focus on photometric , structural and kinematical properties of galaxies at present and high redshift such as luminosity functions , cold gas fractions , sizes , the tully - fisher relation , faint galaxy number counts , redshift distributions , cosmic star formation histories , and so on .",
    "spatial distribution of galaxies is discussed in a subsequent paper @xcite .",
    "we also plan to extend this model in future @xcite to include a quasar formation model developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this paper is outlined as follows : in  2 we describe our sa model . in ",
    "3 we summarize model parameters in our sa model . in ",
    "4 we compare the theoretical predictions of sa model galaxies with various observations at present . in  5",
    "we examine high redshift galaxies predicted by our sa model with observations . in  6 we provide summary and conclusions .",
    "the galaxy formation scenario on which our model is based is as follows : in the cdm universe , small dark matter halos compared with typical present mass of halos emerge through non - linear gravitational evolution of small density fluctuations .",
    "such dark halos cluster and merge into larger halos in a manner that depends on the adopted power spectrum of the initial density fluctuations . in each of the merged dark halos ,",
    "radiative cooling of virialized hot gas , star formation , and gas reheating by supernovae occur . the cooled dense gas and stars constitute _",
    "galaxies_. dark halos are filled with the virialized hot gas , so if the mass of halos is sufficiently large , it should be recognized as an intracluster medium .",
    "these galaxies sometimes merge in a common dark halo , and then more massive galaxies form . repeating these processes , galaxies form and evolve to the present epoch .",
    "merging histories of dark halos are directly taken from @xmath1-body simulations @xcite .",
    "the galaxy formation model running on the merging histories of dark halos is almost the same as the mitaka model given by ny04 , in which the merging histories were realized by using a monte carlo method based on the eps formalism provided by @xcite .",
    "some ingredients of our sa model are revised from those in ny04 .",
    "modifications include a model of the star formation ( sf ) time - scale , a prescription for mergers between satellite galaxies , and a dust extinction model during starbursts .",
    "the details are described below .    throughout this paper ,",
    "a recent standard @xmath2cdm model is considered , that is , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , where these parameters denote the mean density of the universe , the cosmological constant , the hubble parameter and the normalization of the power spectrum of the initial density fluctuation field .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum given by @xcite is used , an extension of @xcite taking into account the effects of baryons .",
    "the cosmic baryon density @xmath7 is adopted @xcite .",
    "those parameters are tabulated in table [ tab : cosmo ] .",
    "model parameters described below are summarized in  3 .",
    "ccccc 0.3 & 0.7 & 0.7 & 0.9 & 0.048      merger trees of dark halos are directly taken from cosmological @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "our simulation has @xmath8 dark matter particles in a box size of @xmath9mpc .",
    "since the minimum number of particles identifying a dark halo is 10 , the minimum mass of dark halos @xmath10 is nearly equal to @xmath11 .",
    "the simulation code is developed by @xcite , based on amr technique to compute the gravitational force @xcite with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the method of identifying dark halos is the friends - of - friends ( fof ) grouping algorithm @xcite , with the linking length @xmath12 as usual .",
    "rigorously speaking , however , fully resolved mass might be larger , about @xmath13 , at which the resultant mass function deviates from a power law , as indicated in figure [ fig : mf ] by open circles with error bars .",
    "the solid line in the figure is a fitting function for several simulations performed with different box sizes from 35 to 140 @xmath14 mpc proposed by @xcite . to evaluate the resolution effects on galaxy formation",
    ", we shall use another set of @xmath1-body results of a 140 @xmath14 mpc box with the same number of particles , @xmath8 in   [ sec : lf ] . the mass function derived by this simulation",
    "is indicated in the figure by solid squares , with a minimum mass of @xmath15 .",
    "parameters of those two simulations , `` 70 '' and `` 140 '' , are tabulated in table [ tab : nbody ] .",
    "ccccc 70 & 70 & 512@xmath16 & @xmath17 & 0.2 + 140 & 140 & 512@xmath16 & @xmath18 & 0.2    figure [ fig : vm ] shows the importance of examining the mass resolution of @xmath1-body simulations on galaxy formation .",
    "the solid lines indicate masses of dark halos for constant circular velocities , @xmath1920 , 30 , 40 , 50 , 60 , 80 , and 100 km s@xmath20 as a function of redshift from the bottom to the top .",
    "we use the spherical collapse model to obtain the relationship between the mass and circular velocity , which is expressed as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the ratio of the mean density in halos collapsing at @xmath23 to the critical density of the universe .",
    "the dashed lines are the minimum masses @xmath10 and @xmath24 as indicated in the figure .",
    "after the cosmic reionization , the jeans mass should be at least @xmath25 km s@xmath20 , which corresponds to @xmath26 k. based on his hydrodynamical simulations , @xcite suggested that an effective jeans mass , or the _ filtering mass _ , becomes even larger affected by the past thermal history , although the results for low redshifts were an extrapolation aided by a linear perturbation theory .",
    "@xcite has reported the following result on the effective jeans mass : the mass of halos which retain half of the gas is well approximated by mass corresponding to circular velocity @xmath27 km  s@xmath20 ; halos with @xmath28 km  s@xmath20 are not able to accrete most of the gas and those with @xmath29 km  s@xmath20 are almost unaffected . as shown in figure [ fig : vm ] , @xmath10 corresponds to @xmath30 km s@xmath20 at @xmath31 and 40 km s@xmath20 at @xmath32 .",
    "these values should be sufficient to resolve the effective jeans mass .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath33 km s@xmath20 at @xmath34 and 80 km s@xmath20 at @xmath32 .",
    "these are marginal , unless the effective jeans mass is similar to or larger than that estimated by @xcite .",
    "thus our 70 @xmath14mpc simulation is quite plausible for correct modeling of galaxy formation .",
    "apart from detailed discussion on the jeans mass , we shall study the effects of the resolution on luminosity functions in   [ sec : lf ] .",
    "note that other theoretical data in the public domain provided by sa models combined with @xmath1-body simulations have much larger masses of dark matter particles .",
    "for example , the particle mass in the gif project @xcite is about 65 times larger than ours , and that of the galics project @xcite is about 27 times larger .",
    "these masses are even larger than our 140 @xmath14 mpc box simulation",
    ".    in our simulation , first collapsing halos emerge at @xmath35 .",
    "then we stock data sets of the particle distribution for approximately 70 time slices . when identifying dark halos , a marker particle for each halo is also defined , which is a particle whose mechanical energy is minimum .",
    "the marker particle is assigned to the halo s central galaxy , which is defined below .",
    "the position of galaxies is specified using the corresponding marker particles . a halo at time @xmath36 is connected with another halo at the next time - step @xmath37 as its progenitor halo , which has the largest number of dark matter particles common to the both .",
    "some collapsed halos , especially small halos , disappear later .",
    "such `` floating '' halos should be fake due to fluctuations of particle distribution , so we remove the floating halos from the sets of merger trees .",
    "some collapsed halos sometimes fragment , particularly at low redshift .",
    "this is caused by highly dense clumps penetrating their host halos , which go back into and are absorbed by the host halos again later .",
    "to avoid such a `` loop '' structure in merging histories , the fragmented halos are forcedly merged into the host halos .",
    "then each merger tree has a _ tree structure _ with a _ root _",
    "halo at @xmath38 .",
    "almost all fragmented halos are small and less than 10% of their host halos in mass .",
    "because the resolution of our @xmath1-body simulation is very high , small halos swallowed by larger halos likely survive and penetrate .",
    "physically , gas in such clumps should not fragment and should quickly merge into hot gas in their host halos , apart from dark matter , because gas is collisional different from collisionless dark matter . therefore ,",
    "as far as we focus on the evolution of baryons , this manipulation should be performed .",
    "the details of this simulation can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent high resolution @xmath1-body simulations of galaxy clusters have revealed that swallowed dark halos survive in their host halos as _ subhalos_. envelopes of these subhalos are stripped by tidal force from the host halo . in our simulations ,",
    "such subhalos are not identified but are taken into account by the following model .",
    "we assume the radius of a tidally stripped subhalo @xmath39 , which had a radius of @xmath40 and mass of @xmath41 before the stripping , by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are respectively the pericenter and apocenter for the orbit of the subhalo , and subscripts `` h '' and `` s '' indicate the host halo and subhalo . in this paper ,",
    "a ratio of @xmath45 is assumed , as in ny04 @xcite .",
    "now we assume a singular isothermal distribution for dark matter in subhalos .",
    "this means that the decrease in mass by the tidal stripping is proportional to @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the tidal stripping significantly affects the time - scale of galaxy mergers (   [ sec : merger ] ) .",
    "firstly , we define the formation of halos as follows : dark halos grow as time passes via mergers and accretion of other halos .",
    "hereafter , the formation epoch of halos is referred to as the time when the mass of a dark halo exceeds twice the mass of the halo at the final formation epoch @xcite . at this time , the circular velocity of the halo is reestimated , since the halo is regarded as collapsing at this epoch . the mean mass density in dark halos is assumed to be proportional to the cosmic mean density at the formation epoch following the spherically symmetric collapse model , independent of the @xmath1-body results .",
    "each collapsing dark halo contains baryonic matter with a mass fraction @xmath47 .",
    "the baryonic matter consists of diffuse hot gas , dense cold gas , and stars .    when a halo forms with a circular velocity @xmath48 , the hot gas contained in the halo is shock - heated to the virial temperature of the halo , @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the proton mass , the boltzmann constant , and the mean molecular weight .",
    "the hot gas density is assumed to have an isothermal density profile with a finite core radius , according to @xcite , @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the virial radius of the host halo , and @xmath55 is the concentration modeled by @xcite , @xmath56 while in @xcite , the concentration is altered depending on the history of each dark halo , we simply assume the above form of the concentration .    a part of the hot gas cools and accretes to the disk of a galaxy until subsequent collapse of dark halos containing this halo .",
    "the amount of the cooled gas is defined by the mass of the hot gas encircled by the _ cooling radius _ , at which the time elapsed from the formation epoch is equal to the cooling time - scale derived using the above density distribution , @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the electron density of hot gas at @xmath59 , @xmath60 is the metallicity of hot gas , and @xmath2 is a metallicity - dependent cooling function provided by @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , gas which cools in a time - step within a halo is added to cold gas of the central galaxy of the halo , which is defined in   [ sec : merger ] , at the beginning of the time - step .",
    "chemical enrichment in hot gas is consistently solved with star formation and sn feedback , as shown below .    in order to avoid the formation of",
    "unphysically large galaxies , the cooling process is applied only to halos with @xmath61 . although @xcite apparently succeeded in avoiding the formation of _ monster galaxies _ without such a cooling cut - off by introducing a history - dependent core radius , they have found that , in the case of higher baryon density , @xmath62 , too many monster galaxies emerge @xcite . here",
    "we take a simple approach to avoid the formation of monster galaxies , which is stopping cooling by hand .",
    "this will be solved if we treat heating processes in clusters of galaxies correctly , e.g. heating by agn / qsos . throughout this paper",
    ", we set @xmath63 km s@xmath20 .",
    "this value might seem somewhat small .",
    "in addition to the higher baryon density , the reason for the difference of this kind of cooling cut - off from ones used in other recent sa models , in which @xmath64 350 - 500 km  s@xmath20 are used , is the treatment of reheated gas by sne .",
    "for example , _ superwinds _ are adopted in @xcite and @xcite which expel gas by sne in addition to the usual sn feedback .",
    "this frees us from the artificial cooling cut - off .",
    "however , the same model , but without the superwind , must adopt a small value of circular velocity for the cooling cut - off .",
    "@xcite have reported that a model without the superwind requires @xmath65 km  s@xmath20 , where the redshift dependence originates by assuming heating by conductive heat fluxes from outer envelopes of halos .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath7 , under the assumption that all baryons are contained in halos , such a small @xmath66 is required . in future , mechanisms of gas - heating and of gas - expulsion from halos should be modeled .",
    "the above assumption that all baryons are retained by dark halos might be too simple .",
    "some have argued that gas known as the warm / hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) may be outside halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if the whim is the gas expelled from galactic - scale halos caused by the superwind or similar mechanisms , the baryon fraction in the halos is lowered . instead",
    ", the whim might be the gas contained in smaller halos which are not resolved in hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "future observation of the whim will provide a clue to the baryon fraction in galactic - scale halos , which constrains the value of @xmath66 .",
    "stars in disks are formed from the cold gas .",
    "the sf rate ( sfr ) @xmath67 is given by the cold gas mass @xmath68 and a sf time - scale @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "although determining @xmath69 in a purely theoretical way is quite difficult , recent sa models suggest that @xmath69 should be dependent on characteristic velocities of galaxies and independent of redshift to explain many observations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we adopt a simple prescription , similar to that of @xcite , @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are free parameters , chosen to match the ratio of the cold gas mass to the @xmath74-band luminosity of spiral galaxies and @xmath75 is the disk rotation velocity defined in  ",

    "because this prescription has only one free parameter , @xmath72 , it is very helpful to search for suitable parameters .",
    "although this worked well in ny04 , in fact , we found that this can not reproduce cold gas fractions in spiral galaxies in the case of weaker sn feedback .",
    "massive stars explode as type ii sne and heat up the surrounding cold gas .",
    "this sn feedback reheats the cold gas at a rate of @xmath79 , where the time - scale of reheating is given by @xmath80 where @xmath81 the free parameters @xmath76 and @xmath78 are determined by matching the local luminosity function of galaxies with observations .",
    "below , we shall use two parameter sets .",
    "one of them has a strong sn feedback efficiency with @xmath82 .",
    "this model is hereafter called the `` strong feedback '' ( sfb ) model . in this case , because of the strong sn feedback , we can take @xmath83 , which makes a star formation time - scale similar to ny04 .",
    "it is not the case for a weak sn feedback . in the other model ,",
    "the sn feedback is weak , @xmath84 .",
    "this is called the `` weak feedback '' ( wfb ) model .    with the above equations and parameters , we obtain the masses of hot gas , cold gas , and disk stars as a function of time or redshift .",
    "associated with star formation and sn feedback , the chemical enrichment is also taken into account by extending @xcite . for simplicity , instantaneous recycling is assumed for sne ii , and any contribution from sne ia is neglected .",

    "the mass - weighted metallicity is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "this means that when the sn feedback is strong , the increase in mean stellar metallicity is small .",
    "the sn feedback clearly plays an important role in chemical enrichment .",
    "when two or more progenitor halos have merged , the newly formed larger halo should contain at least two or more galaxies which had originally resided in the individual progenitor halos . by definition , we identify the central galaxy in the new common halo with the central galaxy contained in the most massive of the progenitor halos .",

    "the parameter @xmath105 is set to 0.8 in this paper by matching the bright end of luminosity functions . in order to judge",

    "however , we do not take into account this effect because it is almost negligible , at least at present , and because this requires quite a long time to compute .",
    "below , we take @xmath129 as a fiducial merger rate , @xmath107 , for equal - mass mergers , and use quantities of subhalos for the mass , radius and velocity dispersion of satellite galaxies . here",

    "it should be noted that the inclusion of the dynamical response to gas removal induced by starbursts provides much better agreement with observed kinematical and structural parameters , particularly for dwarf galaxies , as shown in ny04 .",
    "dark halos have been considered to acquire angular momenta during the linear regime of their collapse through tidal torques made by the initial density fluctuation field @xcite .",
    "assuming that the hot gas component that cools and contracts within a dark halo has the same specific angular momentum as the dark halo has , we can estimate a radius at which the gas is supported by rotation with the conservation of its specific angular momentum . in this way",

    "we adopt @xmath151 and @xmath152 according to @xcite . when the angular momentum of the hot gas is conserved , the effective radius @xmath140 of a resultant cold gas disk is related to the initial radius @xmath153 of the hot gas sphere via @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "the initial radius @xmath153 is set to be the smaller of the virial radius of the host halo and the cooling radius .",

    ", we generalize this size estimation by introducing a simple redshift dependence , @xmath156 where @xmath157 is a free parameter .",
    "we simply use @xmath158 as a reference value in this paper in order to be consistent with the observational galaxy number counts .",
    "the changing of the value of @xmath157 affects the selection effects due to the cosmological dimming of surface brightness and the dust extinction , because the dust column density also changes with galaxy size .    in the case of the formation of elliptical galaxies driven by major mergers of galaxies ,",
    "the size and velocity dispersion are estimated , explicitly taking into account the dynamical response to starburst - induced gas removal .",
    "the outline is as follows : at first , two or more galaxies merge . during the merger , a fraction @xmath159 of the total energy of baryonic matter",
    "is assumed to be dissipated and a spheroidal merger remnant is formed and reaches the virial equilibrium immediately .",
    "subsequently , the starburst occurs and a fraction of gas is gradually expelled from the spheroidal system according to the sn feedback law . because the gravitational potential varies during the gas removal , the system expands and its velocity dispersion is lowered .",
    "the detail is shown below .",
    "sizes of early - type galaxies are primarily determined by the virial radius of the baryonic component .",
    "when a major merger of galaxies occurs , assuming some fraction of the energy loss to the total energy and no rotation of the merger remnant , we estimate the velocity dispersion of the merged system .",
    "now we assign the subscript 0 to the merged galaxy , and subscripts 1 and 2 to the central and satellite galaxies , respectively , in the case of central - satellite merger , or to larger and smaller galaxies , respectively , in the case of satellite - satellite merger . using the virial theorem ,",
    "the total energy for each galaxy is @xmath160,\\ ] ] where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the masses of bulge and disk stars , respectively , and @xmath138 and @xmath75 are the velocity dispersion of bulge and the rotation velocity of disk , respectively . assuming the virial equilibrium , the binding energy @xmath163 between the progenitors just before the merger is given by @xmath164 then we obtain @xmath165 where @xmath166 is a parameter which describes how large a fraction is dissipated from the system . just after the merger",
    ", there remains only the bulge component consisting of cold gas and stars in the merger remnant , whose velocity dispersion is directly estimated from the above equation .",
    "then the size of the system just after the merger is defined by @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the total baryonic mass of the merged system . in reality",
    ", the rate of energy dissipation depends on complicated physical processes such as the escape of high velocity stars and the viscosity and friction due to gas . throughout this paper , however , we adopt @xmath169 for simplicity , which is chosen so that the size and velocity dispersion of ellipticals agrees with observations . apart from @xmath159 , this way of estimating @xmath138 and @xmath170 is similar to that adopted in other sa models such as that by @xcite , in which they formulate the conservation of energy in terms of the size .",
    "next , the cold gas turns into stars and hot gas .",
    "since part of the gas is expelled from galaxies to halos due to the sn feedback , the mass of the system changes . assuming the density distributions of baryonic and dark matters , the dynamical response on the structural parameters to the mass loss can be estimated .",
    "this process was taken into account for the first time in the mitaka model ( ny04 ) in the framework of sa modeling . in this paper",
    "we adopt the jaffe model @xcite for baryonic matter and the static singular isothermal sphere for dark matter , and assume slow ( adiabatic ) gas removal compared with the dynamical time - scale of the system .",
    "note that @xcite also show the dynamical response for different density distributions of baryonic and dark matter and for rapid gas removal cases . defining by @xmath171 and @xmath172 the ratios of mass , size , density and velocity dispersion at a final state relative to those at an initial state , the response under the above assumption is approximately given by @xmath173 where @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath23 are the ratios of density and size of baryonic matter to those of dark matter and , @xmath177 is @xmath178 the subscripts @xmath127 and @xmath179 stand for the initial and final states in the mass loss process .",
    "the contribution of dark matter is estimated from the central circular velocity of halos , @xmath180 , which is defined below . according to numerical simulations of starbursts performed by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the time - scale of gas removal might be comparable to the dynamical time - scale for dwarf ellipticals .",
    "if the gas - removal is almost instantaneous , the effect of the dynamical response becomes stronger , as shown by @xcite .",
    "therefore , the assumption of the slow gas removal is conservative . in reality",
    ", some galaxies might become gravitationally unbound due to the rapid gas - removal .",
    "stars of such galaxies should contribute to halo stars or intracluster stars .",
    "finally the back reaction to the gas removal by the sn feedback on dark matter distribution is computed .",
    "it is natural to consider that dark matter distribution in the central region of dark halos is also affected by the dynamical response to gas removal , because baryons usually condense with density comparable to that of dark matter . to take into account this process",
    ", we define a central circular velocity of dark halo @xmath180 . when a dark halo collapses without any progenitors , @xmath180 is set to @xmath48 .",
    "after that , although the mass of the dark halo grows by subsequent accretion and/or mergers , @xmath181 remains constant or decreases with the dynamical response .",
    "when the mass is doubled , @xmath180 is set to @xmath48 again . the dynamical response to mass loss from a central galaxy of a dark halo by sn feedback lowers @xmath180 of the dark halo as follows : @xmath182 the change of @xmath180 in each time - step is only a few per cent . under these conditions ,",
    "the approximation of static gravitational potential of dark matter is valid during starbursts .",
    "this also applies to subhalos .",
    "once a dark halo falls into its host dark halo , it is treated as a subhalo . because we assume that subhalos do not grow in mass , the central circular velocity of the subhalos monotonically decreases .",
    "thus , this affects the dynamical response later when mergers between satellite galaxies occur .",
    "we assume that the resultant density distribution remains isothermal with @xmath180 at least within the galaxy size .",
    "the details of the dynamical response are shown in @xcite .",
    "the effect of the dynamical response is the most prominent for dwarf galaxies of low circular velocity because of the substantial removal of gas due to strong sn feedback @xcite .",
    "if the dynamical response had not been taken into account , velocity dispersions of dwarf ellipticals would have been much larger than those of observations , determined only by circular velocities of small dark halos in which dwarf ellipticals resided . for giant ellipticals , on the other hand ,",
    "the effect of the dynamical response is negligible because only a small fraction of gas can be expelled due to weak sn feedback .",
    "we refer the reader to ny04 for detailed discussion of the dynamical response .",
    "the above processes are repeated until the output redshift and then the sf history of each galaxy is obtained . for the purpose of comparison with observations , we use a stellar population synthesis approach , from which the luminosities and colors of model galaxies are calculated . given the sfr as a function of time or redshift , the absolute luminosity and colors of individual galaxies are calculated using a population synthesis code by @xcite .",
    "the stellar metallicity grids in the code cover a range from @xmath1830.0001 to 0.05 .",
    "note that we now define the metallicity as the mass fraction of metals .",
    "the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) that we adopt is the power - law imf of salpeter form @xcite , with lower and upper mass limits of @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively . in some sa models",
    ", it has been assumed that there is a substantial fraction of invisible stars such as brown dwarfs which have masses smaller than 0.1@xmath186 . in this paper , however , we do not assume any contributions of such invisible stars to the stellar mass according to ny04 .",
    "the optical depth of internal dust is consistently estimated by our sa model .",
    "we make the usual assumption that the abundance of dust is proportional to the metallicity of cold gas , and the optical depth is proportional to the column density of metals .",
    "then the optical depth @xmath187 is given by @xmath188 where @xmath140 is the effective radius of galaxies and @xmath189 is a free parameter which should be chosen to predict high redshift galaxies being consistent with observations .",
    "there are large uncertainties in estimating the proportionality constant , but we adopt about half the value used by @xcite according to ny04 , because it predicts too strong an extinction to reproduce galaxy number counts . wavelength dependence of optical depth is assumed to be the same as the galactic extinction curve given by @xcite . dust distribution is simply assumed to obey the slab dust model @xcite for disks , according to our previous papers .    in this paper , we introduce dust extinction during starbursts .",
    "we randomly assign the merger epoch within a time - step under consideration , according to the time - scale of mergers .",
    "the sf time - scale of the bursting galaxy is assumed to be the dynamical time - scale , @xmath190 .",
    "this time - scale enables us to compute the amount of metals in cold gas at the output redshift or the end of the time - step . assuming the screen dust model , the optical depth is estimated .",
    "this procedure is important to obtain consistency with observational colors of high redshift galaxies .",
    "if we do not include this , some galaxies right after major mergers become too blue to be consistent with observations .",
    "this is discussed in   [ sec : color ] .",
    "the origin of @xmath189 is still unknown .",
    "we have introduced this parameter just as a phenomenological one . in the wfb model ,",
    "we set @xmath191 , but in the sfb model @xmath192 to decrease the optical depth at high redshift , otherwise too few galaxies were formed to reconcile with observed galaxy number counts .",
    "one of the reasons this is required is that the dust - to - gas ratio may evolve with redshift . at high redshift",
    ", the ratio might be lower than at low redshift .",
    "another possible reason is that the chemical yield we adopt is nearly equal to twice the solar value , which might be too large .",
    "this large value is required to be consistent with observed colors of cluster elliptical galaxies , which have been considered to have shallower imfs of stars than disk stars , so that the chemical yield may be larger than the solar @xcite .",
    "if this is true , the value of the chemical yield must be different depending on the environment , that is , the yield for disk stars should be approximately solar , but larger than solar for spheroidal components . because @xmath189 is required to decrease the optical depth of dust in disks , by adopting a chemical yield similar to the solar value , we will be able to set @xmath191 .",
    "as for recent progress in investigating the chemical enrichment using sa models , we refer the reader to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in this paper , we do not enter into any details and maintain @xmath189 as a phenomenological parameter to reproduce observed high redshift galaxies .",

    "figure [ fig : lf3 ] shows luminosity functions for the sfb and mitaka models with the minimum mass @xmath24 of halos indicated by the solid and dot - dashed lines , respectively , as well as the sfb/140 model by the dashed lines . at first",
    ", it is shown that the sfb/70 model with @xmath24 does not recover the sfb/140 model , except for the cut - off at the faint end , @xmath246 .",
    "the change in the slope caused by the change in minimum mass is quite small .",
    "therefore , the minimum mass seems to mainly affect only very faint galaxies .",
    "second , the faint - end slope of the mitaka model with @xmath24 also hardly changes except for the cut - off .",
    "the bump at @xmath247 is a characteristic luminosity of the faintest galaxies determined by the higher minimum mass . in other words , galaxies formed in dark halos of the minimum mass without any progenitors",
    "should have such luminosities under the given strength of the sn feedback .",
    "thus it is difficult for those to have fainter luminosities .",
    "this figure therefore shows again that the numerical resolution significantly affects galaxy formation , and that there is a limitation in the extended press - schechter formalism which gives us merging histories of dark halos .",
    "we would like to stress here that this is _ not _ a convergence test .",
    "if the merger trees included less massive dark halos , the results would change further . in this case , the faint end of the luminosity function would become steeper because such small halos produce very faint galaxies . in our current model , although no realistic model of the effective jeans mass is included , the mass resolution corresponding to @xmath10 should be required for realistic modeling , because adopting @xmath24 or larger minimum mass corresponds to overestimation of the effective jeans mass .",
    "it should be very important to model the effective jeans mass by utilizing higher - resolution simulations in future .",
    "finally , we discuss mergers of satellite galaxies . as shown in eq.([eqn : mamon2 ] ) , our code enables us to take into account the effect of non - equal mass mergers between satellite galaxies based on @xcite , while this is normally switched off .",
    "figure [ fig : lf4 ] shows this effect on luminosity functions .",
    "the dashed and dotted lines indicate the sfb and wfb models with the effect of non - equal mass mergers , while the solid and dot - dashed lines indicate the sfb and wfb models without this effect , which are the same as those shown in figure [ fig : lf1 ] .",
    "it is easily seen that the luminosity functions with and without the effect of non - equal mergers are almost identical except for the bright end .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , fortunately , we do not need to consider the effect of non - equal mass mergers .",
    "thus we consider only equal mass mergers using the rate of @xmath129 given by @xcite below .",
    "the amount of cold gas , which corresponds to the interstellar medium , is mainly determined by sn feedback - related and sfr - related parameters .",
    "the former parameters determine the gas fraction expelled from galaxies , and the latter , the gas fraction that is converted into stars .",
    "because the sn feedback - related parameters are already constrained by matching luminosity functions as shown in the previous subsection , we can use observed gas fractions in spiral galaxies as constraints on the sfr - related parameters , @xmath73 and @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ fig : cold ] shows the ratio of cold gas mass relative to @xmath74-band luminosity of spiral galaxies as a function of their luminosity .",
    "we assume here that 75% of the cold gas in the models is comprised of hydrogen , i.e. , @xmath248 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines associated with error bars represent the medians and 25% and 75% percentiles of the distributions for the sfb and wfb models , respectively .",

    "although the medians for both models are in good agreement with the observations , the error bars for the theoretical models seem to be larger than the distribution of the observational data .",
    "this might suggest the existence of self - regularization mechanisms of star formation to develop small scatters of cold gas fraction .",
    "nevertheless , we can say that the models agree well with the observational data",

    ", we have to set @xmath253 .",

    "figure [ fig : himf ] shows the theoretical prediction of himfs for the sfb and wfb models , respectively .",

    "the solid and dashed lines represent the sfb and wfb models , respectively .",

    "hot gas contained in a dark halo is assumed to have the same specific angular momentum as that of the halo .",
    "the hot gas cools and contracts until the cooled gas is rotationally supported . thereby the size of disks is determined .",
    "good agreement of the theoretical models with the observational data shown in this figure means that the standard assumption we adopt for determining disk sizes works well when the distribution of the dimensionless spin parameter is in a reasonable range , estimated from the structure formation theory in the cdm universe .    correctly estimating disk sizes is very important to compare theoretical models with observations because it affects many observational properties of galaxies such as the surface brightness and the dust column density .",
    "@xcite have discussed such effects caused by the uncertainty in estimating disk sizes .    figure [ fig : rad ] shows the effective radii of elliptical galaxies against their @xmath74-band magnitudes .",
    "the dots represent individual elliptical galaxies in the ( a ) sfb and ( b ) wfb models .",

    "the solid triangles indicate the observational data taken from @xcite .",
    "the theoretical models agree well with the observational data of at least brighter than @xmath257 . at magnitudes fainter than that",
    ", the fraction of compact ellipticals in the models seems to be smaller than that expected from the observations .",
    "this would be partly caused by the limited resolution .",
    "another possibility is that the sf time - scale at high redshift might be slightly too long . as clearly shown by ny04 , the size of dwarf ellipticals strongly depends on the sf time - scale at high redshift .",
    "for example , let us consider the sf time - scale simply proportional to the dynamical time - scale . in this case , the sf time - scale is shortened for higher redshift , and at @xmath258 , it becomes nearly a quarter of that at @xmath38 .",
    "noting that the sf time - scale also determines the rate of gas consumption , therefore , galaxies are statistically gas - poorer than those in the case of the constant sf time - scale over all redshifts at high redshift , at which galaxies frequently merge . evidently , because the change in size and velocity dispersion due to the dynamical response becomes smaller , galaxies with small sizes and large velocity dispersions increase .",
    "as shown by ny04 , some compact ellipticals represented in figure [ fig : rad ] are closely related to ellipticals formed via gas - poor mergers .",
    "although we are able to make such compact ellipticals by slightly shortening the sf time - scale at high redshift with an extra parameter relating to the redshift dependence , we would like to leave it constant to avoid further complexity of the model .",
    "a detailed discussion about the relationship between the sf time - scale and the size and velocity dispersion of ellipticals can be found in ny04 .",
    "the dashed lines represent constant surface brightnesses of 23.5 and 25.5 mag arcsec@xmath234 as indicated in the figure . because the detection of galaxies is limited by the surface brightness , galaxies with surface brightness lower than the detection limit , which depends on observations ,",
    "can not be detected .",
    "although our models apparently predict too many dwarf ellipticals with radii larger than about 1 @xmath14 kpc , they will not be observed unless ultra deep observations are performed .",
    "note that the samples of galaxies from @xcite may be expected to have sufficiently high surface brightness to investigate their structural and kinematical properties , because the purpose of the paper is to clarify those properties .",
    "thus it should not be a problem that many dwarf ellipticals with much larger radii emerge .",
    "in fact , the selection effects brought about by the surface brightness play a significant role for high redshift galaxies .",
    "this will be shown in  [ sec : highz ] .      here",

    "while gas - rich spirals tend to be more luminous as indicated by @xcite and ny04 , we show only the results for all spiral galaxies .",
    "we find that , although not shown , the tf relation produced only by gas - rich spirals becomes too bright , particularly at @xmath260 km s@xmath20 and too steep at @xmath261 km s@xmath20 to reconcile with observations in both models",

    "as shown in ny04 , the slope is mainly determined by @xmath78 because it provides the dependence of the strength of the sn feedback on the velocity and therefore affects luminosities , particularly of dwarf galaxies .",
    "the deviation at small velocities might disappear if the dynamical response on the rotation velocity to gas removal due to the sn feedback is taken into account , which is currently applied only to spheroidal formation by starbursts . because dwarf galaxies significantly suffer from the sn feedback",

    "figure [ fig : cmr ] shows the @xmath269 color - magnitude ( cm ) diagram for cluster elliptical galaxies .",

    "while the models agree with the observation for dwarf ellipticals , @xmath271 , the predicted cm relations become almost flat for giant ellipticals .",
    "this trend is similar to previous work on sa models whose model parameters are chosen so that many other observations such as luminosity functions are reproduced @xcite .",
    "the mechanism itself to make the slope of the cm relation is well understood in terms of the sn feedback .",
    "the slope for dwarf ellipticals is mainly determined by @xmath272 and the break point at which the cm relation becomes flat mainly by @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "to improve this situation , the metal enrichment should be much more carefully considered because the cm relation mainly follows the metallicity - luminosity relation @xcite . in this paper , the chemical yield",

    "different from the optical counts shown in figure [ fig : sdf1 ] , the agreement with the observations is worse for both models , which overestimate the number of galaxies at @xmath276 .",
    "the sfb model provides somewhat better agreement than the wfb model .",
    "this is because , in the wfb model , more galaxies are formed at high redshift than in the sfb model , due to the weakness of the sn feedback .",
    "note that the @xmath3 band magnitude mainly reflects the stellar mass of galaxies , while optical pass - bands magnitudes reflect the sfr .",
    "because the @xmath3 band magnitude is not significantly affected by dust extinction compared with optical bands , one might consider that a possible way for the wfb model to recover the observed near - infrared counts should be stronger selection effects .",
    "however , such a manipulation also affects the optical galaxy counts , which are already reproduced .",
    "thus , in the range of current modeling , we prefer the sfb model to the wfb , from the @xmath3 band galaxy counts .",
    "finally , we should recall that the above results are due to the choice of the redshift dependences of the size and optical depth , @xmath157 and @xmath189 . in order to obtain the reasonable agreement shown here ,",
    "it is necessary to introduce these parameters into simple models of estimating the disk size and the dust optical depth .",

    "although the peak of the distribution of galaxies above the surface brightness threshold for the hdf is similar to the observation , too many galaxies are detected in the wfb model to be consistent with the observation .",
    "the weak sn feedback is obviously in part responsible for this deviation , because it can not suppress the formation of dwarf galaxies at low redshift .",
    "another important reason is the selection effects .",
    "as shown by the thin lines , the number of galaxies including undetectable ones is comparable ( panel _ b _ ) or sufficiently large ( panel _ c _ ) compared with the observation .",
    "however , since the selection effects are quite strong , only a small fraction of galaxies at high redshift can satisfy the detection criteria for the hdf .",
    "therefore , the number of detectable galaxies for the wfb model is smaller than that for the sfb model at high redshift .",
    "of course , it is possible to increase the number of detectable galaxies at high redshift by changing the detection criteria and/or by changing the redshift dependence of disk sizes . in this case , however , too many faint galaxies would emerge to reconcile with the number of galaxies at low redshift and with the observed galaxy number counts .",
    "it is evident that suppression of galaxy formation is necessary only at low redshift in order to match the redshift distribution for the wfb model with the observation .",

    "we have confirmed that the mitaka model presented in ny04 also shows a tendency similar to the wfb model .",
    "the reason the redshift distribution for the sfb model is improved should be the adoption of merging histories of dark halos directly taken from @xmath1-body simulations .",

    "error bars in panel _ b _ denote 1 @xmath110 poisson scatter . to obtain the isophotal magnitude , according to their paper , we make all galaxies 0.2 mag fainter than their total magnitudes .",
    "the sfb model seems to provide redshift distribution similar to their sa model shown in their figure 1 .",
    "although the sfb model a little overestimates the number of galaxies at @xmath280 , the predicted number of those galaxies at @xmath281 seems slightly closer to the observation than their sa model . in the wfb model ,",
    "similar to the previous figures on redshift distribution , the agreement with the observation is worse compared with the sfb model and the fraction of low redshift galaxies becomes larger .",
    "this is also because of the weakness of the sn feedback .",
    "thus , we can also say that the sfb model is more consistent with the goods redshift distribution than the wfb model .    in short ,",
    "the sfb model is consistent with the photometric redshift distribution for @xmath282 and @xmath283 and the wfb only for @xmath284 and @xmath285 .",
    "currently , observational data are still limited in number and in accuracy of estimation of redshift , particularly for near - infrared pass - bands .",

    "the same observational condition employed in the sdf survey is used .",
    "the crosses indicate the observational data from the sdf survey .",
    "this good agreement with the observations means that the models correctly estimate not only the size of galaxies , but the selection effects arising from the cosmological dimming of surface brightness of galaxies .",
    "the evolution of colors of galaxies depends on growth of stellar mass , stellar ages , and dust extinction .",
    "thus we are able to extract a great deal of information from galactic colors .",
    "figure [ fig : rk ] shows @xmath286 colors of galaxies in the ab system against their redshift . because of comparison with the goods galaxies , we also adopt the selection criterion @xmath287 , where we add 0.2 mag to our models to obtain the isophotal magnitude . in panel _ a _ , the goods galaxies , retrieved from figure 2 of @xcite , are plotted . in panels _ b _ and _ c _ , galaxies in the sfb and wfb models are plotted , respectively . among galaxies satisfying the above criterion ,",
    "we randomly pick out galaxies so as to show almost the same number of galaxies as that of the goods samples .",

    "these ages are the same as those in figure 2 of @xcite so that we can easily compare our results with theirs .",
    "as can be seen , both the sfb and wfb models are in good agreement with the goods survey .",
    "@xcite has concluded that their sa model broadly agrees with the goods survey , while a small discrepancy remains insofar as their sa model does not produce enough galaxies with very red colors , @xmath288 , at @xmath289 .",
    "our models seem to be able to produce more red galaxies , but slight discrepancies also remain .",
    "as shown below , one of these is the lack of galaxies with @xmath290 at @xmath291 , and another is the existence of too many galaxies above the 13.5 gyr single stellar population line .",
    "a key to understanding the evolution of colors should be dust extinction .",
    "our sa model has two types of dust extinction associated with the two modes of star formation , quiescent disk star formation and starbursts . by switching on and off the dust extinction",
    ", we investigate the effects of dust on colors .    here",
    "we examine the effects of dust extinction for starbursts . as explained in   [ sec : photo ] , the sf time - scale for starbursts , @xmath292 , is assumed to be equal to the dynamical time - scale of the spheroidal component , @xmath293 .",
    "firstly we change this relation to @xmath294 , that is , we take half the dynamical time - scale as the sf time - scale for starbursts . in panels",
    "_ a _ and _ b _ of figure [ fig : rk2 ] , we show the same as figure [ fig : rk ] , but for the above short starburst time - scale for the sfb and wfb models , respectively .",
    "it is evident that , in both models , many galaxies with @xmath295 at @xmath296 emerge and therefore the agreement with the observation is much improved , though not perfect .",
    "the reason for this improvement is explained as follows : the time - scale of starbursts in our sa model is distributed in a broad range comparable to the time - step , about 0.3 - 0.5 gyr , at low redshift .",
    "right after starbursts , the age effect on the luminosity , even for such a short time - scale , is significant , so we put the epoch of starbursts within the time - step randomly , depending on the merger time - scale .",
    "therefore , for some galaxies , starbursts happen just before the output redshift .",
    "such galaxies just after starbursts are expected to be intrinsically very blue .",
    "when the sf time - scale for starbursts becomes shorter , the amount of dust estimated from the amount of cold gas and metals becomes smaller at the output redshift .",
    "thus , by shortening the sf time - scale for starbursts , several blue galaxies emerge .    this can be clearly seen if we do not include the dust extinction for starbursts at all . in the center panels",
    "_ c _ and _ d _ of figure [ fig : rk2 ] , we show the same models as the sfb and wfb models but without dust extinction during starburst phases ( ` bare ' starbursts ) . at high redshift @xmath297 ,",
    "very blue galaxies with @xmath298 emerge in both the sfb and wfb models .",
    "these galaxies are those just after starbursts .",
    "the goods data at such a high redshift suggest that clearly starbursts should not be bare , but our dust model for starbursts might be too strong . we have also tried the slab dust model instead of the screen dust model , but found that it does not work well .",
    "it should also be noted that dust extinction can remove galaxies from this figure because galaxies do not satisfy the selection criterion , @xmath287 .",
    "more sophisticated modeling of dusty starbursts would be required in future .",
    "next , we discuss the extinction of disk luminosities . in the right panels _",
    "e _ and _ f _ of figure [ fig : rk2 ] , we show the same models as the sfb and wfb models , but without any dust extinction . by this manipulation ,",
    "galaxies above the line of single stellar populations of 13.5 gyr disappear , similar to the goods data .",
    "this might suggest that our dust model for disks is stronger than the observed galaxies .",
    "part of the reason should be the higher value of the chemical yield we use , because the optical depth is proportional to the metallicity of cold gas , as mentioned in   [ sec : cmr ] .",
    "presumably , careful choice of imfs , which determine the chemical yield , depending on the sf mode will improve the color distribution .",
    "it should be noted that the changing of the optical depth for disks may affect various observables .",
    "for example , weakening the dust extinction in a simple way would cause overestimation of faint galaxy counts in optical pass - bands . in order to obtain full agreement after changing the optical depth , therefore , a new set of model parameters will be required . instead ,",
    "if the extinction only for strongly reddened galaxies is weakened , it might not significantly affect model parameters .",
    "the change of @xmath189 might also recover the agreement with the observational galaxy counts . in all cases ,",
    "the dust model adopted in this paper is very simple and should be refined in future .",
    "by contrast , the dust model for starbursts is not the case because the number fraction of bursting galaxies is smaller than that of normal galaxies .",
    "as shown in the next subsection , however , it might affect the number of high redshift galaxies at @xmath299 , at which a substantial fraction of stars is formed via starbursts , while the contribution to faint galaxy counts is small .",
    "recently the cosmic sf history , which is a plot of sfrs in a comoving volume against redshift , has been recognized as one of the fundamental quantities characterizing galaxy formation @xcite , in spite of large uncertainties in its estimation caused by , for example , dust obscuration and shape of the luminosity function below the detection limit . figure [ fig : csfr1 ] shows the cosmic sfr as a function of redshift .",
    "the solid and dashed lines represent the sfb and wfb models , respectively . for comparison , the mitaka csf model ,",
    "in which the sf time - scale is independent of redshift similar to the sfb and wfb models , is also plotted by the dotted line .",
    "symbols are the observational data from surveys indicated in the figure .",
    "note that the observational values are corrected , taking into account dust extinction , and also that there are still large uncertainties originating in undetected faint galaxies at high redshift . as shown in figure 21 of @xcite , observationally obtained cosmic sfrs strongly depend on the assumed luminosity function , which is guessed from the data for detected bright galaxies .",
    "the upper limits for values at @xmath299 estimated by @xcite are about a factor of two larger than plotted values .",
    "these are obtained by integrating luminosity functions down to the luminosity @xmath300 .",
    "taking into account such uncertainties which are not included in plotted error bars , the sfb and wfb models are in good agreement with the observations .    as we have already shown in ny04 ,",
    "the cosmic sfr strongly depends on the model of the sf time - scale .",
    "if the sf time - scale becomes shorter toward higher redshift , for example , proportional to the dynamical time - scale of disks or halos , the peak of the cosmic sfr moves to a higher redshift . because the sfb and wfb models have the same sf model , which is independent of redshift , their predicted cosmic sfrs are similar .",
    "the mitaka csf model , however , shows different cosmic sfrs , in spite of having the same redshift dependence as the sf time - scale .",
    "this would suggest that it is very important for high redshift galaxies to correctly estimate merging histories of dark halos , as pointed out in   [ sec : zdist ] .",
    "figure [ fig : csfr2 ] shows not only the total cosmic sfr ( _ thick lines _ ) but also the sfr only for starbursts ( _ thin lines _ ) .",
    "the solid and short dashed lines represent the sfb and wfb models , respectively .",
    "the dotted and long dashed lines represent the mitaka csf and dsf models , respectively .",
    "the former has a sf time - scale independent of redshift , and the latter a sf time - scale proportional to the dynamical time - scale of dark halos , which becomes shorter toward higher redshift .",
    "although the total cosmic sfrs of the sfb and wfb models are similar to the mitaka dsf model rather than the mitaka csf model , sfrs for starbursts are quite different .",
    "the sfb and wfb models predict a very large contribution of starbursts to the total sfr up to 15 - 20% at @xmath296 and 25 - 30% at @xmath301 , while the mitaka csf model predicts a contribution of starbursts about 10% at @xmath296 and 20% at @xmath301 and the mitaka dsf model at most 2% at @xmath280 .",
    "if the imf for starbursts is top - heavy , as suggested by @xcite and @xcite , this significant fraction would affect many aspects , such as the chemical enrichment and the cosmic rates of supernovae and @xmath189-ray bursts .",
    "we have developed a semi - analytic ( sa ) model combined with high resolution @xmath1-body simulations , which we call the _ numerical galaxy catalog _ ( @xmath0gc ) .",
    "the minimum mass of dark halos is down to 3.04@xmath302 , which corresponds to @xmath303 km s@xmath20 at @xmath38 and 40 km s@xmath20 at @xmath304 .",
    "these are enough to resolve the effective jeans mass , or the filtering mass , after the cosmic reionization .",
    "to examine the effects of the resolution on galaxy formation , we also used another simulation with a box twice the size , in which the minimum mass of dark halos is @xmath305 corresponding to @xmath306 km s@xmath20 and 80 km s@xmath20 .",
    "although this resolution is not significantly worse among the currently available cosmological @xmath1-body simulations , we have found that it alters luminosity functions , especially the faint - end slope . because sn feedback - related parameters ( @xmath78 and @xmath307 ) are determined so as to match luminosity functions , worse resolutions should affect values of parameters .",
    "we would like to stress that the resolution of our sa model is much better than that of currently available data provided by sa models combined with @xmath1-body simulations in the public domain .",
    "for example , the particle mass of dark matter in the gif project @xcite is about 65 times larger than ours , and that of the galics project @xcite is about 27 times larger .",
    "these are even worse than our 140 @xmath14 mpc box simulation .    within observational uncertainties of the shape of luminosity functions ,",
    "we have adopted two parameter sets .",
    "one is the strong sn feedback ( sfb ) model and another is the weak sn feedback ( wfb ) model . in this paper , we have focused on comparison of these models with photometric , structural , and kinematical properties of observed galaxies .",
    "both models reproduce many observations well , and we slightly prefer the sfb model to the wfb model .",
    "below , we summarize the results .",
    "we have explicitly shown that both the sfb and wfb models are in reasonable agreement with the following observational results : luminosity functions in @xmath74 and @xmath242 bands , cold gas mass - to-@xmath74 band luminosity ratios of spiral galaxies , mass functions , size - magnitude relations for spiral and elliptical galaxies , and the faber - jackson relation at @xmath38 , and faint galaxy number counts in @xmath219 bands , isophotal area , and cosmic star formation histories at high redshift .",
    "note that some of the above observations were used to fix the model parameters .",
    "for example , the sn feedback - related parameters were determined by matching the luminosity functions .",
    "table [ tab : astro ] summarizes observations to fix the parameters .",
    "the sfb model is in broad agreement with the observed galaxy counts in the near - infrared @xmath3 band .",
    "most observed redshift distributions also are broadly reproduced by the sfb model , except for the faintest galaxies ( @xmath308 ) in the subaru deep survey , while the results are much improved compared with those of the mitaka model based on the analytic eps formalism , not on @xmath1-body simulations .",
    "however , since errors caused by uncertainties in estimating photometric redshifts are very large for such faint galaxies , this discrepancy may not be taken so seriously .",
    "future observations with accurate determination of redshifts and with a large survey area will provide sufficiently better redshift distributions for very faint galaxies to make clear whether models are in agreement with observations or not .",
    "by contrast , the wfb model is not consistent with the observed @xmath3 band galaxy counts in the subaru deep field , while it is in agreement with optical ( @xmath219 ) galaxy counts .",
    "this model is also inconsistent with redshift distributions , in particular , for faint galaxies .",
    "the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation slightly favors the wfb model to the sfb model , because the slope of the tf relation predicted by the sfb model is steeper than the observed one .",
    "this contradiction in the tf relation may be improved if we introduce dynamical response on the rotation velocity to gas removal induced by the sn feedback , which is only taken into account for starbursts making spheroidal systems in the current model .",
    "we are going to explicitly consider this effect on spiral galaxies in future .",
    "the bright end of color - magnitude relations of cluster elliptical galaxies in the sfb and wfb models is almost flat against magnitudes and also inconsistent with observations .",
    "presumably , this will be amended by adopting different imfs for disk star formation and starbursts . introducing the chemical enrichment due to sne ia into the mitaka model , @xcite",
    "have shown that chemical yields consistent with salpeter s imf are in agreement with observed metallicities and their ratios in the solar neighborhood .",
    "moreover , @xcite have also shown that metallicities of the intracluster medium can be reproduced only when adopting a top - heavy imf for starbursts and kennicutt s imf for disk star formation .",
    "therefore it is not unreasonable to adopt different imfs . at this stage , however , it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "both models predict @xmath309 colors against redshifts broadly consistent with the observational goods galaxies .",
    "particularly , our models are able to produce red galaxies @xmath310 , which have not been reproduced by an sa model of the goods group @xcite",
    ". however , slight discrepancies remain .",
    "one is lack of galaxies with @xmath311 at @xmath312 .",
    "if we switch off the dust extinction for starburst galaxies , several galaxies emerge .",
    "at the same time , however , very blue galaxies with @xmath313 also emerge .",
    "when a shorter star formation time - scale is used for starbursts similar to half the dynamical time - scale , the situation can be improved .",
    "this means that more sophisticated modeling of dusty starbursts should be required .",
    "second is that our model produces excessively red galaxies at low redshift , @xmath314 .",
    "this is caused by too strong a dust extinction for disk stars .",
    "this might suggest that the chemical yield used here , which is almost twice the solar metallicity , is too large , because dust optical depth is proportional to the metallicity of cold gas . this high value is required to produce red elliptical galaxies to be consistent with observed cluster ellipticals . therefore ,",
    "similar to color - magnitude relations , adopting different imfs for disk star formation and starbursts will help these galaxies become blue .",
    "+ this is a first paper in a series of @xmath0gc .",
    "subsequent papers will discuss clustering properties of spatial distribution of galaxies @xcite .",
    "we also plan to combine the quasar formation model given by @xcite with this model @xcite .",
    "@xmath0gc will be a useful tool with which to understand galaxy formation in studies of various current and future large galaxy surveys .",
    "we would like to thank takashi okamoto for useful comments on modeling galaxy formation with @xmath1-body simulations , nobunari kashikawa for useful discussion on the subaru deep survey , bahram mobasher for providing the goods data of redshift distribution plotted in figure [ fig : goods1 ] , masami ouchi for providing the data of cosmic sfrs plotted in figure [ fig : csfr1 ] , and katsuya okoshi for useful discussion on mass functions .",

    "<S> we construct the _ numerical galaxy catalog _ ( @xmath0gc ) , based on a semi - analytic model of galaxy formation combined with high - resolution @xmath1-body simulations in a @xmath2-dominated flat cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> the model includes several essential ingredients for galaxy formation , such as merging histories of dark halos directly taken from @xmath1-body simulations , radiative gas cooling , star formation , heating by supernova explosions ( supernova feedback ) , mergers of galaxies , population synthesis , and extinction by internal dust and intervening clouds . as the first paper in a series using this model </S>",
    "<S> , we focus on basic photometric , structural and kinematical properties of galaxies at present and high redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> two sets of model parameters are examined , strong and weak supernova feedback models , which are in good agreement with observational luminosity functions of local galaxies in a range of observational uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> both models agree well with many observations such as cold gas mass - to - stellar luminosity ratios of spiral galaxies , mass functions , galaxy sizes , faint galaxy number counts and photometric redshift distributions in optical pass - bands , isophotal angular sizes , and cosmic star formation rates . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the strong supernova feedback model is in much better agreement with near - infrared ( @xmath3-band ) faint galaxy number counts and redshift distribution than the weak feedback model and our previous semi - analytic models based on the extended press - schechter formalism . observed tully - fisher relations for bright galaxies and color - magnitude relations for dwarf </S>",
    "<S> elliptical galaxies in clusters of galaxies are broadly reproduced , but no agreement with observations is obtained over whole ranges . nevertheless , they are improved compared with results produced by other semi - analytic models . a direction for overcoming the remaining problems </S>",
    "<S> is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the resolution of @xmath1-body simulations , which is down to @xmath4 for the minimum mass of dark halos consisting of ten dark matter particles in our model , plays a significant role in galaxy formation , and that merging histories of dark halos directly taken from @xmath1-body simulations produce results different from models based on the extended press - schechter model even if the mass function of dark halos at present is set to be the same as that obtained by the same @xmath1-body simulations used here . </S>"
