    "the gravitational instability is commonly accepted as the process of large - scale structure formation in the universe . according to this scenario , structures formed by the growth of small inhomogeneities present in the early universe .",
    "gravitational instability gives rise to a coupling between the density and peculiar velocity fields of matter .",
    "on very large , linear scales , the relation between the peculiar velocity @xmath10 and the density contrast @xmath11 in co - moving coordinates is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hubble constant .",
    "[ for simplicity of notation , we use the notation ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) instead of ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) . ] the coupling constant , @xmath18 , carries information about the underlying cosmological model and is related to the cosmological matter density parameter , @xmath14 , and cosmological constant , @xmath15 , by @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the linear amplitude of peculiar velocities is thus sensitive to @xmath14 ; on the other hand , it is quite insensitive to  @xmath15",
    ". hence , comparing the observed density and velocity fields of galaxies allows one to constrain @xmath14 , or the degenerate combination @xmath20 in the presence of so called galaxy biasing ( e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "this is done by extracting the density field from all - sky redshift surveys  such as the point source catalogue redshift survey ( pscz , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the 2mass redshift survey ( 2mrs , * ? ? ?",
    "* )  and comparing it with the observed velocity field from peculiar velocity surveys . the methods for doing this fall into two broad categories .",
    "one can use equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) , calculating the divergence of the observed velocity field and comparing it directly with the density field from a redshift survey ; this is referred to as a _ density  density comparison_. alternatively , one can use the integral form of equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) to calculate the predicted velocity field from a redshift survey , and compare the result with the measured peculiar velocity field ; this is called a _ velocity ",
    "velocity comparison_. velocity  velocity comparisons are generally regarded as more reliable , since they involve manipulation of the denser and more homogeneous redshift catalogue data , while density ",
    "density comparisons require manipulation of the noisier and sparser velocity data . in both cases ,",
    "the density and velocity fields need to be smoothed in order to reduce errors and shot noise .",
    "velocity comparisons require a smaller size of smoothing , of a few @xmath21 .",
    "for example , @xcite used a smoothing scale of @xmath22 @xmath21 .",
    "such scales are called _ mildly non - linear _ : the variance of the density field smoothed over the scale of a few @xmath21  is of order unity .",
    "mildly non - linear extensions of equation  ( [ eq : linear ] ) have been developed by a number of workers .",
    "these extensions have been based either on various analytical approximations of non - linear dynamics ( @xcite ; bernardeau 1992 , hereafter @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or numerical ( either n - body or hydrodynamic ) simulations ( @xcite ; kudlicki et  al.2000 , hereafter @xcite ) , or both ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; bernardeau et  al.1999 , hereafter @xcite ) . unlike the linear case  ( [ eq : linear ] ) , the non - linear relation between the velocity divergence and the density contrast at a given point is non - deterministic ( though in the non - linear regime the two fields remain highly correlated ) .",
    "therefore , for a full description of the relation , the conditional means ( mean @xmath23 given @xmath11 and vice versa ) are not sufficient : one has to describe the full bivariate distribution function for @xmath23 and @xmath11 , or at least the conditional scatter .",
    "these aspects of the velocity  density relation were studied by @xcite and more extensively by @xcite . however , in practical applications the intrinsic scatter in the velocity  density relation is much smaller than the one induced by observational errors , and the conditional means are sufficient .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found that very good fits to the mean relations , obtained for the mildly non - linear fields extracted from numerical simulations , were given by modifications of the formula of @xcite .",
    "this formula describes a non - linear relation between initially gaussian , random fields of @xmath23 and @xmath11 , under the assumption of a vanishing variance of the density field ( so the relation has no scatter ) .",
    "@xcite claimed his relation to be the same as the one exhibited in the spherical collapse model ( hereafter scm ) . in practical applications ( namely with non - zero variance of the density field ) , he predicted his formula to work well in voids , but ` to become very inaccurate for @xmath11 larger than 1 or 2 ' .    in _ this _",
    "paper we study the velocity  density relation in the scm .",
    "the reason for such an approach is twofold .",
    "first , to derive his formula , @xcite used quite sophisticated methods ( summing up first non - vanishing contributions from the reduced part of _ all - order _ joint moments of @xmath23 and @xmath11 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the dynamics of the scm is very simple and should allow to re - derive the formula of @xcite in a straightforward way . more importantly , in the scm the relation can be easily extended to higher values of @xmath11 , with the hope that this modification will fit better the results of numerical experiments of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the scm is in principle insensitive to the variance of the density field ( and the resulting velocity ",
    "density relation is deterministic ) , but in practice the variance of the smoothed density field dictates how high density contrasts can be reached .    the non - linear relation between @xmath11 and @xmath24 (",
    "note the scaling @xmath25 ) depends very weakly on cosmological parameters .",
    "@xcite analysed the @xmath14-dependence of the scaled velocity ",
    "density relation in the limit @xmath26 and found it to be very weak .",
    "@xcite showed that second and third order expansions for @xmath11 and @xmath27 depend extremely weakly on @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that this is the case for _ all _ orders .",
    "specifically , they showed that perturbative solutions for the density contrast for arbitrary cosmology are , with a good accuracy , separable : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the linear growing mode for this cosmology and @xmath30 is the spatial part of the @xmath31-th order solution for the einstein  de sitter model . using the continuity equation one",
    "can then prove , by induction , that the velocity divergence depends on @xmath14 and @xmath15 practically only through the factor @xmath32 .",
    "most generally , nusser & colberg ( 1998 ) ( hereafter @xcite ) showed _ the equations of motion _ of the cosmic pressureless fluid to be ` almost independent ' of cosmological parameters .",
    "the weak dependence of the scaled velocity ",
    "density relation on the background cosmological model has been also confirmed by n - body numerical simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the @xmath14-dependence of the equations of motion of the cosmic dust stops to be weak when @xmath33 ( see eqs .  1314 of @xcite ) .",
    "this regime of @xmath14 is not physically relevant , since the currently preferred value of @xmath14 is much higher .",
    "still , @xcite derived his formula applying the limit @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we will neglect @xmath15 ( setting @xmath35 ) , but will retain the @xmath14-dependence of the equations of the spherical collapse and in particular examine the limit of small @xmath14 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",

    "contrary to the claim of @xcite , the formula of @xcite is not exact in the limit of an empty universe . on the contrary",
    ", it completely fails in this regime : the exact relation in the scm is then @xmath287 , for an arbitrary @xmath11 . in fact , this is a general result of dynamics in a low - density universe .",
    "although the formula of @xcite fails for @xmath288 , where it was expected to work best , for realistic values of @xmath14 ( say , @xmath289 ) , it describes very well the scm velocity ",
    "density relation in voids .",
    "it also works for overdensities up to @xmath290  @xmath22 .",
    "the velocity  density relation in the scm is given in a parametric form .",
    "our goal here was to eliminate this parameter ( at least approximately ) and to provide the relation analytically .",
    "we aimed at describing the relation in the whole range @xmath291 ( realistically , up to @xmath292 ) .",
    "therefore , instead of expanding it around @xmath293 , we adopted an entirely different approach .",
    "namely , we derived asymptotes of the relation in the highly non - linear regime : @xmath294 ( @xmath295 ) for overdensities and @xmath296 for voids .",
    "( although we also ` expanded ' around them , in a sense that we also calculated next - to leading - order terms . )",
    "these two asymptotes turned out to be qualitatively different .",
    "inspired by their functional forms , we invented semi - phenomenological fits to the exact relation ( separately for overdensities and voids ) , fulfilling the linear theory condition @xmath297 .",

    "it describes well the exact relation in the scm up to the turn - around ( for @xmath199 , @xmath298 ) . as already stated , the formula of @xcite starts to deviate from the exact relation for @xmath299 .",
    "we have also fitted the regime @xmath300 , though virialisation and departures from spherical symmetry make practical applicability of the scm in this regime very limited .",
    "+ in case of voids , the most important results of this paper are formulae  ( [ eq : theta2_ansatz ] ) and  ( [ eq : theta3_ansatz ] ) , with @xmath185 given by equation  ( [ eq : theta_min ] ) .",
    "compared with the scm , simple formula  ( [ eq : theta2_ansatz ] ) has a maximal error of about @xmath301% and is probably sufficient for practical applications .",

    "there is therefore no guarantee that better agreement with the scm implies better agreement with the real relation . in order to check this issue",
    "we compared our formulae to fits to results of cosmological numerical simulations , that are present in the literature .",
    "we have found that in voids , our formulae , as well as the formula of @xcite , describe well the real relation .",
    "this is partly a consequence of the fact that voids are more spherical than overdensities . in overdensities , both our formula and that of @xcite require modification , but ours less",
    "this discrepancy is not a failure of the latter of the two , since it has never been intended to work for @xmath305 .",
    "our formula  ( [ form : fit pot ] ) , having the same second - order expansion as the formula of @xcite , can be regarded as its extension into the mildly non - linear regime ( for @xmath11 up to the turn - around ) .",
    "we have also discussed how to ( slightly ) modify our formula to better fit numerical simulations .",
    "+ in section  [ sec : intr ] we have enlisted arguments for weak dependence of the velocity  density relation on the cosmological parameters . therefore ,",
    "in the present analysis we set @xmath306 . to study the limit @xmath288 we have retained @xmath14-dependence of the equations of the scm .",
    "analysing these equations we have confirmed that for realistic values of @xmath14 , the @xmath14-dependence of the relation is indeed very weak . in final formulae",
