    "the `` concordance '' @xmath1cdm cosmological model , which includes some unseen cold dark matter ( dm ) and a cosmological constant ( @xmath1 ) acting as a repulsive form of dark energy ( de ) , has been remarkably successful in explaining the formation and evolution of cosmological structures at different scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    however , at cosmological scales , the cosmological constant as `` vacuum state '' of the gravitational field is about 120 orders of magnitude smaller than the value predicted by any quantum gravity theory ( @xcite ) and comparable to the matter density ( coincidence problem ) , even if they evolved decoupled in the history of the universe .",
    "in addition , looking at the galaxy scales there are a few critical issues yet to be solved , which are giving hard time to the whole @xmath1cdm framework .    since the discovery of the flat rotation curves of spiral systems , galaxies have been the most critical laboratory to investigate the gravitational effects of the dm halos , to be compared against the expectation of the cosmological simulations ( @xcite , nfw hereafter , @xcite , @xcite ) . here",
    ", the @xmath1cdm model is not able to fully explain the shallow central density profile of spiral and dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "early - type galaxies ( etgs hereafter ) have been proven only recently to be consistent with @xmath1cdm predictions ( and wmap5 cosmological parameters , e.g. @xcite ) , from their centers ( @xcite ) to their peripheries ( @xcite , n+11 hereafter ) , although there are also diverging results showing that etgs in some cases have too high ( @xcite ) or too low ( e.g. @xcite ) concentrations .",
    "this very uncertain context has been a fertile soil for alternative approaches to the so - called `` missing mass '' .",
    "the basic approach is that the newtonian theory of gravity , which has been tested only in the solar system , might be inaccurate on larger ( galaxies and galaxy clusters ) scales .",
    "the most popular theory investigated so far , the modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) proposed by @xcite , is based on phenomenological modifications of newton dynamics in order to explain the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies , and passed a number of observational tests ( @xcite ) , included etg kinematics ( @xcite ; ; ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "only lately it has been derived in a cosmological context @xcite .",
    "a new approach , motivated from cosmology and quantum field theories on a curved space - time , has been proposed to study the gravitational interaction : the extended theories of gravity ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . in particular ,",

    "this approach is based on a straightforward generalization of einstein theory where the gravitational action ( the hilbert - einstein action ) is assumed to be linear in the ricci curvature scalar @xmath3 . in the case of @xmath0-gravity , one assumes a generic function @xmath4 of the ricci scalar @xmath3 ( in particular analytic functions ) and asks for a theory of gravity having suitable behaviors at small and large scale lengths .",
    "as shown in @xcite , analytic @xmath0-models give rise , in general , to yukawa  like corrections to the newtonian potentials in the weak field limit approximation ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the correction introduces a new gravitational scale , besides the standard schwarzschild one , depending on the dynamical structure of the self - gravitating system .",
    "here we want to test these yukawa - like gravitational potentials against a sample of elliptical galaxies .",
    "this approach has been proposed earlier , in a phenomenological scheme for anti ",

    "the test we are proposing at galaxy scales is crucial : reproducing kinematics and then dynamics of these very different classes of astrophysical systems in the realm of the same paradigm is needed to test these new gravitational theory as an alternative to dm which has not been definitely found out at fundamental level .",

    "we will use the inner long slit data and the extended pn kinematics for three galaxies which have published dynamical analyses within dm halo framework : ngc 3379 ( @xcite ; @xcite , dl+09 hereafter ) , ngc 4494 ( @xcite , n+09 ) , ngc 4374 ( n+11 ) .",
    "the decreasing velocity dispersion profiles of the first two galaxies have been modeled with an intermediate mass halo , @xmath45 , with concentration @xmath46 and a fair amount of radial anisotropy in the outer regions . for ngc 4374 , having a rather flat dispersion profile , a more massive ( adiabatically contracted ) halo with @xmath47 and @xmath48 was required with a negligible amount of anisotropy in the outer regions .",
    "these models turned out to be in fair agreement with the expectation of wmap5 @xmath49 relation ( n+11 ) and with a @xcite imf , making this sample particularly suitable for a comparison with an alternative theory of gravity with no - dm as we want to propose here .",

    "[ gravpot1 ] here we want to show that , beside flat rotation curves , this also naturally accounts for fundamental scaling relations of galaxies : the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation for spirals and faber - jackson ( fj ) relation for etgs .",

    "thus the arguments below apply to galaxies in general .    although the point ",
    "like version of the potential implies that the circular velocity @xmath53 scales with mass as @xmath54 ( as pointed out by ) , if one derives the circular velocity for an extended galaxy this can be generalized as @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a characteristic radius ( e.g. the disk length for spirals or the effective radius encircling half of the galaxy light for etgs ) , @xmath57 is a generic function which includes the radial dependence of the enclosed mass and the above yukawa - like term .",

    "we finally remark that the tf relation has been found not to be conflicting with @xmath0 potentials in @xcite , although the potentials from @xmath71 adopted there are just a series expansion of the yukawa  like potential coming out from a more general polynomial f(r ) as in eq .",

    "<S> we present the first analysis of extended stellar kinematics of elliptical galaxies where a yukawa  like correction to the newtonian gravitational potential derived from @xmath0gravity is considered as an alternative to dark matter . in this framework , we model long - slit data and planetary nebulae data out to 7  of three galaxies with either decreasing or flat dispersion profiles . </S>",
    "<S> we use the corrected newtonian potential in a dispersion  kurtosis jeans analysis to account for the mass  anisotropy degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these modified potentials are able to fit nicely all three elliptical galaxies and the anisotropy distribution is consistent with that estimated if a dark halo is considered . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter which measures the `` strength '' of the yukawa  like correction is , on average , smaller than the one found previously in spiral galaxies and correlates both with the scale length of the yukawa  like term and the orbital anisotropy . </S>"
