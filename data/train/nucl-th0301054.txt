    "the study of the @xmath4-induced two photon emission on nuclei has attracted much attention in the last decades .",
    "but most of the efforts have been aimed at its application in pionic atoms @xcite . in this work",
    "we will aim in another direction , focusing in two main objectives : first of all we will explain how to extend the free @xmath5 reaction to the process in nuclei using many body techniques successfully used to describe different pionic reactions @xcite , paying special attention to the distortion of the initial pion in the nucleus .",
    "our second aim will be to study the viability of using the @xmath0 reaction in nuclei as a way to test the modification of the properties of the scalar - isoscalar @xmath1 meson in nuclear matter .",
    "in the recent past there has been a very lively discussion about the existence , nature and properties of the scalar meson @xmath6 which lasts till today @xcite .",
    "the most important source of controversy comes from the confrontation between the interpretation of the @xmath1 meson as an ordinary @xmath7 meson or as a @xmath2 resonance .",
    "the advent of @xmath8 has brought new light into this problem and soon it was suggested @xcite that the @xmath1 could not qualify as a genuine meson which would survive in the limit of large @xmath9 .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath10 interaction in s - wave in the isoscalar sector is strong enough to generate a resonance through multiple scattering of the pions .",
    "this seems to be the case , and even in models starting with a seed of @xmath11 states , the incorporation of the @xmath10 channels in a unitary approach leads to a large dressing by a pion cloud which makes negligible the effects of the original @xmath11 seed @xcite .",
    "this idea has been made more quantitative through the introduction of the unitary extensions of @xmath8 ( @xmath12 ) @xcite .",
    "these works implement unitarity in coupled channels in an exact form and use the input of the lowest and second order chiral lagrangians of @xcite .",
    "another point of interest which can help us understand the nature of the @xmath1 meson is the modification of its properties at finite nuclear density .",
    "the importance of the medium modification of the @xmath10 interaction in the scalar sector was suggested in @xcite where the @xmath10 amplitude in the medium developed large peaks below the two pion threshold , somehow indicating that the @xmath1 pole had moved to much lower energies .",
    "the issue has been revised and the models have been polished incorporating chiral constraints @xcite with the result that the peaks disappear at normal density , but still much strength is shifted to low energies .",
    "experimental tests of the renormalization of the @xmath1 properties in the medium have been performed using two pion production reactions induced by photons @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 @xcite . in the latter reaction",
    "the absorption of the pions in the nucleus caused the process to be too much peripheral to manifest the in - medium @xmath1 effects , to the point that the large changes seen in the experimental @xmath2 mass distribution from deuterium to heavier nuclei @xcite could not be explained @xcite .",
    "it was argued there that the abnormal feature was not the size of the @xmath15 invariant mass distribution close to threshold in nuclei , but the very small size of this magnitude in deuterium , coming from a subtle cancellation of different terms in the amplitude .",
    "the offset of this cancellation in nuclei could bring the strength of the @xmath15 distribution in nuclei to its `` normal size '' ( given by the @xmath16 distribution ) .",
    "so far the most successful reaction has been the @xmath17 reaction where the @xmath18 invariant mass distribution in nuclei , evaluated in @xcite , shows a shift of strength towards lower invariant masses with respect to the reaction on the proton .",
    "this shift has been corroborated in a recent experiment in @xcite .    because of the importance and controversy on this topic , more reactions testing the modification of the @xmath1 meson in the medium would be welcome .",
    "one of the possible candidates is the @xmath0 reaction in nuclei .",
    "this process is interesting because there is no absorption of the final state particles by the nucleus and , hence , allows one to test bigger nuclear densities . in this sense , the reaction should in principle be preferable to other reactions which have been theoretically used as a test of the modification of the @xmath2 interaction in the nuclear medium like @xmath13 and @xmath14 in nuclei .",
    "the use of the @xmath0 reaction to test experimentally the in - medium @xmath19 modification has been preliminary study in @xcite . in this latter work , comparison of data on @xmath0 for proton and @xmath20 targets , using simulations of the theoretical model of @xcite , hinted , as a preliminary result , to a small modification of the @xmath19 decay in the nuclear medium .    from the point of view of @xmath21",
    "the @xmath1 meson can appear in the @xmath0 reaction via the @xmath2 rescattering involved in the @xmath22 mechanism @xcite .",
    "but this mechanism is only one among all the mechanisms involved in the @xmath0 reaction @xcite .",
    "the strength of the terms in the reaction proceeding through @xmath1 excitation , relative to that of other mechanisms , will determine the chances to see @xmath1 effects in the medium .",
    "hence a quantitative study of this reaction is needed to provide a proper answer to this question .",
    "for the evaluation of the @xmath5 amplitude we will first consider the mechanisms shown in fig .  [ fig : diagrams_free ] .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 diagrams , which are negligible at small momenta , were not considered in @xcite since the authors were only interested in pionic atoms .",
    "but now , since we are also interested in higher momenta of the initial pion , one must keep these terms .",
    "other possible diagrams like those where the two photons come from one @xmath25 decay or the bremsstrahlung of one photon on the nucleon lines were considered in @xcite .",
    "but we will not consider them because : in the first case the diagrams with the @xmath26 mechanism are only relevant near the region where @xmath27 and can be easily filtered experimentally .",
    "in the second case , the diagrams with bremsstrahlung on the nucleon lines can be neglected because their contribution to the cross section are of the order of @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the momenta of the nucleons and the photon involved and @xmath30 the mass of the nucleon .",
    "it is also possible to consider the effect of intermediate @xmath31 states which in @xcite were estimated to be around @xmath32% of the diagram @xmath33 of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams_free ] near threshold .",
    "the smallness of these terms was also corroborated by the fair agreement of the model ignoring them with the data of @xmath0 in pionic atoms @xcite . at the higher energies where we will work ,",
    "the @xmath34 contribution should be a little bit bigger . yet , for the purpose of the present paper , which is to build up the framework for the study of the @xmath35 reaction in nuclei and its viability to see @xmath1 medium modification , we can safely ignore the nucleon - bremsstrahlung and @xmath34 terms .    the amplitude corresponding to the diagrams of fig .",

    "the imaginary part of the pion selfenergy is obtained when the intermediate states ( a particle - hole and two photons ) are placed on shell in the integrations over the momenta of the intermediate states .",
    "this can actually be implemented using cutkosky rules , applying the following substitutions to the lines cut by a straight line drawn between the two external pions as shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : self ] ) and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma - a ] ) we obtain the following expression for the @xmath0 reaction in nuclei : @xmath79    so far the distortion of the incoming pion inside the nucleus before it reaches the production point @xmath65 has not been taken into account .",
    "since pions interact strongly with nucleons , the loss of pion flux makes the reactions in nuclei involving pions in initial or final states to be more peripheral and to produce less desired events .",
    "this strong distortion of the pions inside the nucleus has turned out to be crucial in the evaluation of cross sections and nuclear effects in reactions involving pions @xcite .",
    "pions inside a nucleus can be distorted in many ways : can be absorbed ; can undergo quasielastic collisions and change direction , energy , charge or even have inelastic collisions and produce more pions . in order to quantify the distortion of the pions we make an eikonal approximation and remove from the pion flux those pions which undergo absorption , which indeed disappear .",
    "we also remove the pions which undergo quasielastic collisions because , even if they do not disappear , they lose much energy and the cross section for production of two photons in the upper part of the @xmath80 spectrum , where we will be interested , is considerably reduced , ( see fig .",

    "fig : z3].b we have plotted the equivalent curves to fig .  [ fig : z3].a but for @xmath100 .",

    "[ fig : z3].b one can see that the effect of the chiral terms , where the @xmath1 meson plays a role , is to increase the cross section in around @xmath113 at @xmath114 of energy .",
    "therefore one could expect , in principle , a similar effect in the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "but in the @xmath0 reaction we only obtain a tiny effect .",

    "[ fig : z4 ] different contributions separately , and we refer to this figure in what follow .    we have checked that the effect of adding the chiral terms to the diagram @xmath33 of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams_free ] is to increase the cross section in around @xmath115% at @xmath116 , both in @xmath100 and in the invariant mass distribution of the two photons in the @xmath0 reaction ( lines 2 ) . in @xmath100 the @xmath33 term ( line 1 ) is the only significative one at this energy since @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( line 3 ) tend to 0 at threshold .",
    "thus the total effect of the chiral terms in the cross section is a @xmath115% close to @xmath101 ( change between line 5 and 6 ) .",
    "but in @xmath0 the @xmath37 and @xmath38 terms ( as well as @xmath23 and @xmath24 , not present in @xmath100 ) no longer vanish ( line 3 ) because the virtual pion momenta are not zero .",
    "actually it is @xmath117 times larger than the @xmath33 term ( line 1 ) at @xmath118mev .",

    "this is the reason why the effect of the chiral terms , accounting for the dynamical generation of the @xmath1 , is so small in the @xmath0 reaction . in summary : the large size of the pion - bremsstrahlung terms and its opposite interference with the chiral ones mask the effect of the @xmath1 meson .    in spite of this discouraging result",

    "the dashed - dotted line is the same plot but renormalized to the peak of the continuous line in order to compare both curves . a shift of strength to low invariant masses when the medium effects are considered can be observed .",

    "looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude_born ] ) we can see that , should we go to very low pion momentum , these terms would vanish , but we would be in a kinematical region very far from @xmath101 where the shift in the @xmath2 amplitude in the medium occurs according to fig .",
    "[ fig : imtpipi ] .",
    "there are , however , some possible experimental set ups to remove these hindering terms :    the first one is to keep only those events where the two photons are produced in the direction of the incident @xmath4 .",
    "this would force the polarization vectors @xmath39 and @xmath40 to be orthogonal to @xmath58 and then these terms would vanish .",
    "the photons so chosen can go in the same direction or back - to - back .",
    "we have also to remove those which go in the same direction because they have zero invariant mass .",
    "when this filter is actually implemented , one has to choose a finite acceptance angle for the deviation of the photons with respect to the direction of the incident pion .",
    "the results when we implement this filter with an acceptance angle of @xmath121  degrees are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z6].a .",
    "the continuous line is calculated with zero density for the chiral terms , the dashed one is the full model and the dashed - dotted line is the full model normalized to the continuous line .",
    "we can see that the effect of the density in the chiral terms is visible in the size but barely noticeable in the shape of the strength because this cut favours the accumulation of events at high invariant masses , thus minimizing the @xmath101 region .",
    "the other problem with this filter is the strong decrease of the statistics since the cross section is reduced in nearly five orders of magnitude , mostly due to the reduced phase space acceptance .",
    "another possibility to eliminate the hindering terms , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : amplitude_born ] ) , is to implement a filter on the polarization of the photons in such a way that only those events with photon polarization orthogonal to the momentum of the initial @xmath4 are accepted . in fig .  [",
    "fig : z6].b we can see that the implementation of this latter filter causes the invariant mass distribution to look much more like that of fig .",
    "[ fig : z5 ] .",
    "the shift of the shape between the continuous and dashed - dotted lines manifests the modification due to the nuclear medium of the @xmath2 interaction in the @xmath1 channel .",
    "but this procedure has the strong inconvenience of having to filter the polarization of photons in the final state .",
    "in addition to this problem , one should point out that by filtering the photon polarization the cross section has been reduced in a factor 20 , hence reducing appreciably the statistics of a cross section already small to start with .",
    "this also has the inconvenience that , given the fact that an eventual polarization of the photons would necessarily have a certain uncertainty in this polarization , this uncertainty , allowing the contribution from the pion - bremsstrahlung terms , could drastically enhance the cross section with respect to the one calculated in fig .",
    "[ fig : z6].b , thus masking the @xmath1 in medium effects . in the same direction , the bremsstrahlung terms on the nucleon lines , which are small compared to the dominant terms of the full model as we pointed out ,",
    "would no longer be small compared to those of the filtered amplitude , which could also make the cross section bigger than evaluated in fig .",

    "we have implemented in the @xmath0 reaction the model of @xcite for the @xmath123 reaction where the dynamical generation of the @xmath1 plays an important role .",
    "we have investigated whether a shift of strength in the invariant mass distribution of the two photons appears when we pass from the free reaction to the in - medium case .",
    "the first observation is that the very strong background due to the pion - bremsstrahlung mechanisms hides the desired effect .",
    "we have tested several experimental filters and kinematical cuts in order to reduce the influence of these pion - bremsstrahlung terms , but even then we have obtained a small signal of the desired effects and , furthermore , these experimental set ups seem not easy to implement .",
    "all this said , we must conclude that the @xmath0 reaction on nuclei is not a very suitable reaction to test the in - medium modification of the properties of the @xmath1 meson , in spite of testing bigger nuclear densities than the @xmath13 or @xmath14 reactions .    leaving this negative result aside",
    ", the present work has performed a realistic model for the @xmath0 reaction in nuclei , extrapolating the results for the same reaction in pionic atoms done in @xcite to the region of pions in the continuum .",
    "comparison with the experiment can serve as a further test of the many body techniques used here which have been successfully used for other reactions , providing extra confidence in these easy to implement and , so far , quite accurate methods , which can be applied to most nuclear reactions at intermediate energies .",
