    "double white dwarfs ( wds ) in tight enough ( @xmath14 ) binaries to reach contact in a hubble time are expected on theoretical grounds @xcite , and are presumed to be the progenitors of highly variable objects : r  crb stars , am  cvn binaries , and type ia supernovae @xcite .",
    "however , examples of these systems are rare , with only 10 known prior to our work @xcite . many of these binaries are of immediate interest for the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ ) , providing ` verification ' sources loud enough to be detected in space @xcite .",
    "spectral measurements of the high proper motion object by @xcite revealed it to be a low - mass ( @xmath15 ) helium core wd with @xmath16 and @xmath17k and an h - rich ( da ) atmosphere .",
    "the strong expectation that low - mass he wds can only be formed in common envelope events led @xcite to note that this object was likely a binary . indeed , they found a @xmath18 velocity difference between two measured spectra .",
    "nltt  11748 was originally targeted in a zz  ceti like pulsation search based on theoretical calculations and the @xmath19 and @xmath20 measurements @xcite . in this",
    "failed pulsation search , our rapid ( @xmath0 minute ) differential photometry with the las cumbres observatory s faulkes telescope north ( ftn ) revealed @xmath1 s 3%6% dips , which were confirmed by keck spectroscopy to be primary and secondary eclipses from a @xmath21 faint c / o wd companion orbiting at 5.6hr .",
    "nltt  11748 joins the growing class @xcite of wd binaries where the low - mass wd is a very low - mass ( @xmath15 ) helium core wd .",
    "these are made when the lower mass star overfills its roche lobe at the base of the red giant branch @xcite , triggering a common envelope event that leads to an in - spiral of the now exposed low - mass he core to a shorter orbital period .",
    "theoretical work has found a dichotomy in the evolution of these low - mass he core wds @xcite that dramatically impact their cooling rate .",
    "for masses @xmath220.2@xmath23 ( metallicity dependent ) , the h envelope undergoes shell flashes that reduce its mass , eventually allowing the wd to cool rapidly .",
    "however , less massive ( @xmath15 ) wds undergo stable h burning for gigayears , dramatically slowing their evolution and keeping them brighter for much longer than expected .",
    "our observations are summarized in section [ sec : obs ] , demonstrating that the companion to nltt  11748 is a cold ( @xmath24k ) , old ( 1.53gyr ) c / o wd .",
    "we show in section [ sec : res ] that eclipse modeling yields the first radius measurement of an extremely low - mass wd .",

    "we immediately identified two dips in the light curve , @xmath423minutes in duration and a few percent in depth , indicative of eclipses . to verify the existence of eclipses we observed the system again on 2010 january 8 ( night 2 ) , for 3.5hr , revealing two similar eclipses at the expected times based on the previous observations .",
    "an additional 30-minute observation was obtained on 2010 february 3 ( night 3 ) .",
    "photometric processing was carried out using iraf aperture photometry and the vaphot package of routines @xcite .",
    "three comparison stars were selected to yield a light curve with the smallest variance . in 45s exposures , each of these stars accumulated @xmath43@xmath3910@xmath44 while nltt  11748 accumulated @xmath45@xmath3910@xmath44 . the differential light curve for nltt  11748",
    "was constructed using the scheme detailed in steinfadt et al .",
    "( 2008b , inspired by @xcite ) .",
    "a de - trending second - order polynomial removed uncorrected long - term variations , such as color  airmass effects .",
    "for all data points outside of eclipses we find a @xmath46dof of 404.8/372 , indicating a reasonable estimate of our uncertainties .",
    "after considering the radial velocity measurements in section [ sec : obsrv ] , we found that nights 1 and 2 had primary and secondary eclipses , while night 3 shows a secondary eclipse . using the technique of @xcite we fit the transit centers of each eclipse , and",
    "combined all eclipse timings ( primary ( bjd tdb ) : 2,455,188.886207(89 ) , 2,455,205.81071(29 ) ; secondary ( bjd tdb ) : 2,455,188.76882(16 ) , 2,455,205.92783(19 ) , 2,455,231.784879(19 ) ) in a linear least - squares analysis to find the orbital period of @xmath47hr ( barycentering used the jpl de405 ephemeris ) .",
    "fitting ephemerides using the primary and secondary eclipses separately gives consistent results with our reported ephemeris ( table [ tbl : params ] ) .",
    "the resulting phased light curve from all three nights of data is shown in figure [ fig : rvlc ] .",
    "we observed nltt  11748 with high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires , @xcite ) on the 10-m keck  i telescope 6 times on 2010 february 2 and twice on 2010 february 4 .",
    "all observations were taken with the same grating tilt , integrating for 5minutes , binning by 3 pixels in the spatial direction , and with a @xmath48 slit ( giving @xmath49 ) .",
    "the wavelength solution was based on a th  ar lamp , accurate to @xmath50pixel ( with @xmath51 ) , and the data covered @xmath52 .",
    "the stability of the solution was monitored to high precision by g.  marcy ( private communication , 2010 ) .",
    "we used the h@xmath53 line for our radial velocity measurements , although other lines were detected at lower significance .",
    "we initially identified the velocity from each spectrum by eye , then shifted each spectrum to zero velocity and combined them .",
    "we fit the combined h@xmath53 spectrum with the sum of a broad ( @xmath54 fwhm ) lorentzian and a narrow ( @xmath55 fwhm ) gaussian with roughly equal depths . using this template",
    ", we then measured radial velocities and fit them to a sinusoid with the period and phase constrained by the eclipse timing .",
    "we then iterated this procedure , using the velocities from the radial - velocity fit to construct the template , fitting the template shape , fitting the individual velocities , and fitting the radial velocity curve .",
    "this converged quickly : after one iteration all changes were @xmath56 .",
    "we obtain a @xmath28 for the radial velocity fit ( assuming a circular orbit and an accurate ephemeris from the eclipse photometry ) of 4.5 for 6 dof .",
    "our final radial - velocity amplitude was @xmath57 yielding a mass function @xmath58 , or an @xmath59 secondary for a fiducial @xmath60 primary .",

    "we do not correct for gravitational redshift as uncertainties in @xmath13 and @xmath36 are too high and we expect a shift of only @xmath62 .",
    "we checked our velocities by fitting only the broad component of the h@xmath53 line or the h@xmath63 line , and both gave consistent results although with a factor of 6 lower precision .",
    "we limit the eccentricity of the orbit to @xmath64 at 3@xmath65 .    at the primary s orbital velocity",
    ", the width of the narrow h@xmath53 component may be broadened by orbital motion : the maximum derivative is @xmath66 .",
    "compared with the narrow h@xmath53 component , @xmath67 fwhm , this effect is unlikely to affect our data ( 5-minute exposures ) but might have slightly influenced the @xmath19 measurement of @xcite .",
    "[ sec : binpa ]    the deepest ( primary ) eclipse is the transit of the primary object ( 1 ) by the secondary ( 2 ) , and the shallowest ( secondary ) is the occultation of the secondary by the primary .",
    "there are six relevant binary parameters to be fitted : the primary and secondary radii and masses ( @xmath36 , @xmath68 , @xmath13 and @xmath35 ) ; flux ratio ( for our filter / ccd response ) @xmath33 ; and inclination @xmath69 .",
    "we consider the orbital period , @xmath70 , and the linear limb darkening coefficient , @xmath34 , as fixed .",
    "we presume @xmath71 but will show how its uncertainty ( @xmath72 , @xcite , and @xcite ) modifies our desired parameters .",
    "the eclipse light curve in figure [ fig : ecllc ] shows the secondary eclipse as flat - bottomed while the primary eclipse shows the distinct signature of limb darkening .",
    "this indicates that the eclipses are likely total ( confirmed by our inclination measurements ) and @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 .",
    "we initially fit the eclipses with a parameterization of the linear limb darkening law @xcite for the primary eclipse and a box function for the total secondary eclipse , yielding the depths , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and durations , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the 1@xmath65 results are reported in table [ tbl : params ] with the 1@xmath65 , 2@xmath65 , and 3@xmath65 contours plotted in the insets of figure [ fig : ecllc ] .",
    "this allows us to directly measure @xmath33 , as @xmath76 .",
    "the sparsity of our data in eclipse requires additional assumptions about the properties of the secondary .",
    "the flat bottom secondary eclipse unambiguously gives a low flux ratio ( at sdss-@xmath9 ) of @xmath77 which implies that the value of the primary eclipse total depth must be dominated by the radii ratio .",
    "our measured primary eclipse depth implies @xmath78 , further corroborated by the unseen ( and thereby fast ) ingress and egress in the secondary eclipse .",
    "our measurements of @xmath33 and @xmath79 constrain the temperature of the secondary relative to the 8500k primary . taking sdss-@xmath80 measurements as bolometric ( @xmath81 )",
    "gives @xmath82k , which we confirm by using the synthetic photometry of @xcite , constraining the flux ratio of model atmospheres integrated over the filter passband .",
    "the @xcite spectrum constrains the primary to be a low - mass , @xmath83 , likely he wd with a radius @xmath84 .",
    "this implies an @xmath85 companion .",
    "therefore , the secondary can not be a main sequence ( ms ) star as @xcite constrain such an ms star to have @xmath86 based on two micron all sky survey photometry , breaking our mass function and radius constraints .",
    "a brown dwarf would break our mass function and radius constraints .",
    "a neutron star is far too small and its luminosity contribution insufficient .",
    "therefore , a cold c / o wd is the only solution , meeting the radius , mass , and luminosity constraints .",
    "we powerfully constrain the binary parameters by directly integrating the faces of the primary and secondary and model our light curve for any arbitrary inclination and phase by assuming a linear limb darkening law .",
    "we do this with a code originating from @xcite and @xcite , including the effects of microlensing in the binary ( following @xcite and @xcite ) . for the approximate parameters above",
    ", the einstein radius is @xmath87 , giving @xmath88 and @xmath89 , leading to a 1% magnification of the primary at conjunction .",
    "our measurement of @xmath25 and @xmath33 reduces our six - parameter system to four - parameter system .",
    "our surface temperature measurement yields an age of 1.53.0 gyr @xcite for the secondary allowing us to use m - r relations of cold wds @xcite for our current work .",
    "though @xcite derived an @xmath90 from their low - resolution spectrum , radial velocity broadening and theoretical model uncertainties may render this determination unreliable .",
    "therefore , we calculate separate @xmath28 grids of @xmath36 and inclination for a range of @xmath13 .",
    "minimization of @xmath28 on each grid constrains @xmath36 and inclination directly and @xmath91 techniques yield their uncertainties .",
    "we scale these uncertainties to consider the additional uncertainties of @xmath33 and @xmath25 using a monte carlo method",
    ".    the results of our direct eclipse fitting method are displayed in figure [ fig : rpvsmp ] with the parameters and uncertainties reported in table [ tbl : params ] for @xmath60 . without including lensing the fits",
    "would be very similar , but the inclination would be slightly lower ( closer to @xmath92 ) and the radius of the primary would be slightly larger ( @xmath93 for @xmath71 ) .",
    "the @xmath28 minima for all @xmath13 within each @xmath34 data set in figure [ fig : rpvsmp ] are approximately consistent and as such yield no constraint on @xmath13 over this range .",
    "our range of @xmath94 , 0.3 , and 0.5 results in a @xmath95% spread in @xmath36 measurements , consistent with the @xmath96 of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 value is reduced slightly as @xmath34 increases ; however , we can not constrain @xmath34 due to the sparsity of data at ingress / egress .",
    "this will be constrained in future higher cadence data sets . for @xmath97",
    "the minimum @xmath28 values significantly increase and the quality of the eclipse fits degrade .",
    "therefore , our combined radial velocity and light curve data sets provide an upper limit , assuming that the secondary is a c / o wd , of @xmath98 .",
    "our discovery of the first eclipsing detached double wd binary has substantially constrained low - mass he wd models with radius measurements that agree with current models @xcite .",
    "additional measurements will reveal even more about the faint @xmath99 c / o wd secondary . with our discovery , there are 11 confirmed double wd binaries that will merge within a hubble time . from spectroscopic masses alone ,",
    "six of these contain low - mass ( @xmath100 ) he core primaries with large ( @xmath101 ) radii indicative of a stable h burning shell @xcite .",
    "other than its inclination , nltt  11748 is not extraordinary in any way relative to these , many of which offer larger solid angles for eclipse observations than nltt  11748 .",
    "our analysis of this system is far from complete , but our existing constraints , table [ tbl : params ] and figure [ fig : rpvsmp ] , highlight the value of further studies .",
    "high cadence photometry , resolving the ingress / egress of each eclipse , would yield the component radii as functions of inclination and orbital semimajor axis .",
    "if future spectroscopic observations can reveal the secondary s line features and measure its radial velocity , this would allow precise measurements of the masses of both components .",
    "detection of eclipses in different filters , both bluer and into the infrared , would additionally constrain the temperature of the secondary further as well as its age .",
    "model - independent mass and radius determinations for he and c / o wds are rare . for he wds , there exist several pulsar binary systems for which shapiro time delay measurements have yielded accurate mass determinations : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . of these , only four have radii measurements , psr  j0437@xmath1024715 , psr  j0751 + 1807 , psr  j1911@xmath1025958a and psr  j1909@xmath1023744 .",
    "however , all rely upon either distance measurements and evolutionary model - dependent luminosities or gravity measurements derived from atmospheric models .",
    "therefore , he wd evolutionary models @xcite remain largely unconstrained . for c / o wds ,",
    "mass and radius measurements have been more frequent @xcite and all rely on distance measurements via parallax or cluster membership , surface brightness measurements and detailed knowledge of each spectrum . to reach the precisions required to constrain theoretical models ,",
    "these measurements must rely upon atmospheric model spectra .",
    "only recently @xcite have derived precise measurements of mass and radius in a model - independent way in the eclipsing binary system .",
    "nltt  11748 offers an additional c / o wd system for model - independent mass and radius measurements as well as the first such system for he wds .",
    "gravitational wave emission will bring this system into contact in @xmath103gyr ( for @xmath104 ) . with",
    "a mass ratio of @xmath105 , stable mass transfer at contact is likely to occur and create an am  cvn binary @xcite .",
    "the known orbital period , inclination , and distance ( @xmath106pc ) yield the gravitational wave strain at earth , @xmath107 @xcite at a frequency @xmath108hz for @xmath104 . though not ` louder ' than the verification sources tabulated by @xcite , nltt  11748 s accurate ephemeris allows for a coherent folding of the _ lisa _ data over the mission duration .",
