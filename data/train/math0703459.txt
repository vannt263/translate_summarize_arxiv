    "simplicial trees were introduced by the second author in @xcite in order to generalize algebraic structures based on graph trees .",
    "more specifically , the facet ideal of a simplicial tree , which is the ideal generated by the products of the vertices of each facet of the complex in the polynomial ring whose variables are the vertices of the complex , is a normal ideal ( @xcite ) , is always sequentially cohen - macaulay ( @xcite ) and one can determine exactly when the quotient of this ideal is cohen - macaulay based on the combinatorial structure of the tree ( @xcite ) .",
    "these algebraic results that generalize those associated to simple graphs , and are intimately tied to the combinatorics of the simplicial complex , have suggested that this is a promising definition of a tree in higher dimension .",
    "this fact was most recently confirmed when the authors , while searching for an efficient algorithm to determine when a given complex is a tree , produced a precise combinatorial description for a simplicial cycle that has striking resemblance to that of a graph cycle ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main idea here is that a complex ( or a simple hypergraph ) is a tree if and only if it does not contain any `` holes '' , or any cones over holes .",
    "moreover , our definition of a simplicial cycle , though more restrictive than that defined for hypergraphs by berge  @xcite , satisfies the hypergraph definition as well . in a way , simplicial cycles are `` minimal '' hypergraph cycles , in the sense that once a facet is removed , what remains is not a cycle anymore , and does not contain one .",
    "once the concept of a `` minimal '' cycle is in place , a natural question that arises is whether the length of such a cycle bears any meaning in terms of properties of the complex ? in graph theory bipartite graphs are characterized as those that do not contain any odd cycles .",
    "one of their strongest features is that they satisfy the knig property .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to investigate whether simplicial complexes ( or hypergraphs ) not containing odd simplicial cycles , which we call _ odd - cycle - free _ complexes , also satisfy this property .",
    "it turns out that besides one family , all odd - cycle - free complexes do satisfy the knig property ( theorem  [ t : mainthm ] ) .",
    "the proof uses tools from hypergraph theory , as well as berge s recently proved strong perfect graph conjecture ( @xcite ) .",
    "a much more general notion of a cycle already exists in hypergraph theory ( @xcite ) ; we call these _ hyper - cycles _ ( definition  [ d : hyper - cycle ] ) to avoid confusion .",
    "it is known that hypergraphs that do not contain odd hyper - cycles are _ balanced _ , and hence satisfy the knig property .",
    "the class of odd - cycle - free complexes which we study in this paper includes the class of simple hypergraphs that do not contain odd hyper - cycles , and hence our results generalize those already known for hypergraphs .",
    "we discuss these inclusions in section  [ s : hyper - cycles ] .",
    "simis , vasconcelos and villarreal showed in  @xcite that facet ideals of bipartite graphs are normally torsion free , and hence normal . recently",
    "herzog , hibi , trung and zheng  @xcite have generalized their result and shown that facet ideals of mengerian complexes ( hypergraphs ) are normally torsion free .",
    "this includes the class of simple hypergraphs that do not contain odd hyper - cycles , and more generally , balanced hypergraphs .",
    "we demonstrate in section  [ s : hyper - cycles ] that odd - cycle - free complexes are not necessarily mengerian , and hence their facet ideals are not necessarily normally torsion - free , although they could still be normal ideals .    while this paper refers to simplicial or facet complexes most of the time for the statements , it is important to know that these structures , for our purposes , are essentially simple hypergraphs .",
    "the original work on higher dimensional trees and cycles was done in the context of commutative algebra , where a rich tradition of studying ideals associated to simplicial complexes was already in place .",
    "this paper , on the other hand , uses many results from hypergraph theory . for this reason , and for the sake of consistency , in the introductory parts of the paper ,",
    "we give a careful review of all the structures that we use and demonstrate how it is possible to move between complexes and hypergraphs without losing the validity of any of our statements .",
    "we define the basic notions related to facet complexes . more details and examples",
    "can be found in  @xcite .    a _ simplicial complex _ @xmath0 over a finite set of vertices @xmath1 is a collection of subsets of @xmath1 , with the property that if @xmath2 then all subsets of @xmath3 are also in @xmath0 .",
    "an element of @xmath0 is called a _ face _ of @xmath0 , and the maximal faces are called _ facets _ of @xmath0 .    since we are usually only interested in the facets , rather than all faces , of a simplicial complex , it will be convenient to work with the following definition :    a _ facet complex _ over a finite set of vertices @xmath1 is a set @xmath0 of subsets of @xmath1 , such that for all @xmath4 , @xmath5 implies @xmath6 .",
    "each @xmath7 is called a _ facet _ of @xmath0 .",
    "the set of facets of a simplicial complex forms a facet complex .",
    "conversely , the set of subsets of the facets of a facet complex is a simplicial complex .",
    "this defines a one - to - one correspondence between simplicial complexes and facet complexes . in this paper",
    ", we will work primarily with facet complexes .",
    "we now generalize some notions from graph theory to facet complexes .",
    "note that a graph can be regarded as a special kind of facet complex , namely one in which each facet has cardinality 2 .",

    "finally , we say that @xmath0 is _ connected _ if every pair of facets is connected .",
    "in order to define a tree , we borrow the concept of _ leaf _ from graph theory , with a small change .",
    "[ d : leaf ] let @xmath3 be a facet of a facet complex @xmath0 .",
    "then @xmath3 is called a _ leaf _ of @xmath0 if either @xmath3 is the only facet of @xmath0 , or else there exists some @xmath14 such that for all @xmath15 , we have @xmath16 . the facet @xmath11 above is called a _ joint _ of the leaf @xmath3 if @xmath17 .",
    "it follows immediately from the definition that every leaf @xmath3 contains at least one _ free vertex _ , i.e. , a vertex that belongs to no other facet .",
    "[ example11 ] in the facet complex @xmath18 , @xmath3 and @xmath19 are leaves , but @xmath11 is not a leaf .",

    "@xmath23    in example  [ example11 ] as well as in the rest of this paper , we use a shaded @xmath24-polygon to display a facet with @xmath24 vertices .",
    "so we can think of the facet complex @xmath0 in the example above as if the vertices were labeled with @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "[ d : tree ] a facet complex @xmath0 is a _ forest _ if every nonempty subset of @xmath0 has a leaf .",

    "it is clear that any facet complex of cardinality one or two is a forest .",
    "when @xmath0 is a graph , the notion of a simplicial tree coincides with that of a graph - theoretic tree .",
    "[ e : free - example ] the facet complexes in example  [ example11 ] are trees .",
    "the facet complex pictured below has three leaves @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 ; however , it is not a tree , because if one removes the facet @xmath32 , the remaining facet complex has no leaves .",

    "a _ minimal vertex cover _ of @xmath33 is a subset @xmath21 of @xmath1 such that @xmath21 is a vertex cover , and no proper subset of @xmath21 is a vertex cover for @xmath33 .",
    "the smallest cardinality of a vertex cover of @xmath33 is called the _ vertex covering number _ of @xmath33 and is denoted by @xmath38 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a facet complex .",
    "a set @xmath39 of facets of @xmath0 is called an _",
    "independent set _ if @xmath40 whenever @xmath41 .",

    "an independent set of facets which is not a proper subset of any other independent set is called a _",
    "maximal independent set _ of facets .      in this section ,",
    "we define a simplicial cycle as a minimal facet complex without leaf .",
    "this in turn characterizes a tree as a connected cycle - free facet complex .",
    "the main point is that higher - dimensional cycles , like graph cycles , possess a particularly simple structure : each cycle is either equivalent to a `` circle '' of facets with disjoint intersections , or to a cone over such a circle .",

    "the next remark is an immediate consequence of the definitions of cycle and forest .",

    "however it fails the knig property , since @xmath178 , but @xmath179 .",
    "similar examples in higher dimensions can be constructed .",
    "we next focus on the second condition in the statement of theorem  [ t : mainthm ] , which turns out to be inductively necessary for satisfying the knig property .",
    "[ l:7-cycle - no - konig ] let @xmath0 be a facet complex such that @xmath104 is the complement of a 7-cycle",
    ". then @xmath0 fails the knig property .",
    "suppose @xmath180 where @xmath181 is a 7-cycle , and let @xmath182 such that the vertices of @xmath181 correspond to the facets @xmath183 in that order ; in other words , @xmath29 intersects all other facets but @xmath30 and @xmath154 , and so on ( see figure  [ f : compl-7-cycle ] ) .",
    "let @xmath54 be a maximal independent set of facets , and assume @xmath184 . then , since @xmath29 intersects all facets but @xmath30 and @xmath154 , @xmath54 can contain one of @xmath30 and @xmath154 ( but not both , since they intersect ) .",
    "so @xmath185 . the same argument holds if @xmath54 contains any other facet than @xmath29 , so we conclude that @xmath186 .",
    "now suppose @xmath0 has a vertex cover of cardinality 2 , say @xmath187 .",
    "then each facet of @xmath0 must contain one of @xmath75 and @xmath76 . without loss of generality ,",
    "suppose @xmath188 .",
    "since each facet does not intersect the next one in the sequence @xmath189 , we have @xmath190    but now @xmath191 , which is a contradiction .",
    "so @xmath192 , and hence @xmath0 does not satisfy the knig property .",
    "if every subset of a facet complex @xmath0 satisfies the knig property , then @xmath104 can not contain the complement of a 7-cycle as an induced subgraph .",
    "as suggested above , if @xmath104 contains the complement of a 7-cycle as an induced subgraph , @xmath0 may fail the knig property , even though it may be odd - cycle - free .",
    "for example , consider the complex @xmath0 on seven vertices @xmath193 : @xmath182 where @xmath194 , @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 , @xmath198 , @xmath199 , @xmath200 .",
    "the graph @xmath104 is the complement of a 7-cycle ( the labels of the facets correspond to those in figure  [ f : compl-7-cycle ] ) .",
    "one can verify that @xmath0 contains no 3 , 5 , or 7-cycles , so it is odd - cycle - free .",
    "however by lemma  [ l:7-cycle - no - konig ] , the facet complex @xmath0 fails the knig property ; indeed @xmath201 but @xmath186 .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is easy to expand @xmath0 to get another complex @xmath61 , such that @xmath126 does contain the complement of a 7-cycle as an induced subgraph , and @xmath61 satisfies the knig property . for example , consider @xmath202 , where @xmath203 are the same facets as above , and we introduce two new vertices @xmath204 to build the new facets @xmath205 , and @xmath206 .",
    "the set @xmath207 is a maximal independent set of facets , so @xmath208 .",
    "also , we can find a vertex covering @xmath209 , which implies that @xmath201 .",
    "note , however , that @xmath61 does not satisfy the knig property `` inductively '' : it contains a subset @xmath210 that fails the knig property by lemma  [ l:7-cycle - no - konig ] .",
    "the notion of a cycle has already been defined in hypergraph theory , and is much more general than our definition of a cycle ( see  @xcite , or chapter 5 of  @xcite ) . to keep the terminologies separate , in this paper",
    "we refer to the traditional hypergraph cycles as _ hyper - cycles_. in particular , hypergraphs that do not contain hyper - cycles of odd length are known to satisfy the knig property . in this section , we introduce this class of hypergraphs and show that hypergraphs not containing odd hyper - cycles are odd - cycle - free , and their line graphs can not contain the complement of a 7-cycle as an induced subgraph .    [",
    "d : hyper - cycle ] let @xmath87 be a hypergraph on vertex set @xmath1 .",
    "hyper - cycle _ of length @xmath128 ( @xmath211 ) , is a sequence @xmath212 where the @xmath213 are distinct vertices and the @xmath35 are distinct facets of @xmath87 , and moreover @xmath214 ( mod @xmath128 ) for all @xmath117 .",
    "herzog , hibi , trung and zheng  @xcite called a hyper - cycle a _ special cycle _ if , with notation as in definition  [ d : hyper - cycle ] , for all @xmath117 we have @xmath215 if and only if @xmath216 ( mod @xmath128 ) . in other words , if each vertex @xmath213 of the hyper - cycle appears in exactly two facets , the hyper - cycle is a special cycle .",
    "so a balanced hypergraph is one that does not contain any special cycle of odd length .",
    "special cycles have also been called _ strong _ cycles in the literature .",
    "it is easy to see that a cycle @xmath0 defined as @xmath217 produces a hyper - cycle ; just pick any vertex @xmath218 ( mod @xmath128 ) , @xmath0 produces a hyper - cycle , or in fact a special cycle , of the same length @xmath128 @xmath219      [ e : ocf - not - balanced ] consider the complex @xmath0 below , which is odd - cycle - free , as the only cycle is the 4-cycle @xmath220 .",
    "but @xmath0 is not balanced , as all of @xmath0 forms the special 5-cycle @xmath221    the complex in example  [ e : ocf - not - balanced ] is an example of how our main result ( theorem  [ t : mainthm ] ) generalizes the fact that balanced complexes satisfy the knig property .",
    "in fact , we can show the following .        by lemmas  [ l : linegraph - subcollection ] and  [ l : cycle - graph ]",
    ", @xmath0 contains a subset @xmath61 whose line graph is the complement of a 7-cycle , we write @xmath222 .",
    "suppose @xmath223 such that the vertices of the 7-cycle @xmath181 correspond to the facets @xmath183 in that order ; in other words , @xmath29 intersects all other facets but @xmath30 and @xmath154 , and so on ( see figure  [ f : compl-7-cycle ] ) .",
    "we claim that we can find vertices @xmath224 , @xmath225 , @xmath226 , @xmath227 , and @xmath228 , such that @xmath229 is a special cycle of length 5 , and if not , @xmath0 contains a special cycle of length 3 .",
    "the main obstacle in making the hyper - cycle in ( [ e:5-cycle ] ) a special 5-cycle , is finding appropriate choices for the vertices @xmath230 .",
    "suppose these choices are not possible , in which case at least one of the following statements hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath231 . +",
    "this is not possible , since we know that @xmath232 , and @xmath233 . since @xmath234",
    ", one can choose @xmath224 such that @xmath235 .",
    "2 .   @xmath236 ( since @xmath237 ) .",
    "+ in this case , consider the facet complex @xmath238 .",
    "then , since @xmath239 and @xmath240 , we have @xmath241 .",
    "lemma  [ l:3-cycle ] now implies that @xmath238 is a 3-cycle , and hence can be written as a special 3-cycle .",
    "3 .   @xmath242 ( since @xmath237 ) .",
    "+ similar to case 2 .",
    "it follows that @xmath243 is a ( special ) 3-cycle .",
    "4 .   @xmath244 .",
    "+ fails with argument similar to case 1 .",
    "so one can choose @xmath227 such that @xmath245 .",
    "+ fails with argument similar to case 1 .",
    "so one can choose @xmath247 such that @xmath248 .",
    "so we have shown that either there are vertices @xmath230 such that the sequence in ( [ e:5-cycle ] ) is a special 5-cycle , or otherwise , either cases 2 . or 3 . above",
    "would hold , in which case @xmath0 would contain a ( special ) 3-cycle . either way ,",
    "@xmath0 is not balanced .          in closing",
    ", we would like remark that odd - cycle - free facet complexes , unlike balanced ones , are not necessarily mengerian . as indicated below",
    ", this fact has implications for the algebraic properties of the facet ideals of such complexes .",
    "the facet complex in example  [ e : ocf - not - balanced ] is an example of an odd - cycle - free complex which is not mengerian . to see this ,",
    "let @xmath249 be the incidence matrix of @xmath0 , where the rows correspond to the facets and the columns to the vertices of @xmath0 : @xmath250 and pick the vector @xmath251 .",
