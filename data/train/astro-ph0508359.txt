    "recent observations @xcite of @xmath5 gev @xmath0-rays with the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) from the x - ray binary jet source ls 5039 establish that microquasars are a new class of @xmath0-ray emitting sources .",
    "these results confirm the earlier tentative identification of ls 5039 with the egret source 3eg  j1824 - 1514 @xcite .",

    "microquasars now join blazar agns as a firmly established class of very - high energy ( vhe ; with energies @xmath7  a few hundred gev  tev ) @xmath0-ray sources .",
    "the nonthermal continuum emission of blazars is believed to be produced in a relativistic plasma jet oriented at a small angle with respect to our line of sight .",
    "their radio through uv / x - ray emission is most likely due to synchrotron emission by relativistic electrons in the jet , while the high energy emission can be produced by compton upscattering of lower - energy photons off relativistic electrons ( for a recent review , see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or through hadronic processes @xcite .",
    "because of their apparent similarity with their supermassive agn cousins , it has been suggested that galactic microquasars may be promising sites of vhe @xmath0-ray production ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while earlier work on @xmath0-ray emission from x - ray binaries focused on neutron star magnetospheres as @xmath0-ray production sites ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the vhe @xmath0-ray detection of ls  5039 suggests that the @xmath0-ray production is more likely to be associated with the jets .",
    "high - energy @xmath0-rays of microquasars can be produced via hadronic ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or leptonic processes . in the latter case",
    ", the most plausible site would be close to the base of the mildly relativistic jets , where ultrarelativistic electrons can compton upscatter soft photons .",
    "possible sources of soft photons are the synchrotron radiation produced in the jet by the same ultrarelativistic electron population ( ssc = synchrotron self - compton ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or external photon fields @xcite . both ls  5039 and v615  cas are high - mass x - ray binaries which are rather faint in x - rays , with characteristic 1  10  kev luminosities of @xmath8  ergs  s@xmath9 .",
    "this is much lower than the characteristic bolometric luminosity of the high - mass companions of these objects , at @xmath10  erg / s .",
    "consequently , the dominant source of external photons in ls  5039 and v615  cas is the companion s optical / uv photon field .",
    "the intense radiation field of the high - mass companion will , however , also lead to @xmath1 absorption of vhe @xmath0-rays in the @xmath11  gev  tev photon energy range if vhe photons are produced close to the base of the jet . for the case of ls  5039 ,",
    "@xcite have estimated that vhe emission produced within @xmath12  cm of the central engine of this microquasar would be heavily attenuated ( @xmath13 for @xmath14  gev ) , and the observed spectrum of vhe photons would be hardened compared to its intrinsic shape . for comparison ,",
    "the @xmath1 opacity due to stellar radiation back - scattered by the stellar wind in the vicinity of the binary system ( for which the angle of incidence between the line of sight and the target soft photon field would be more favorable for @xmath1 absorption ) may be estimated as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath17 is the mass outflow rate , @xmath18 is the terminal velocity of the stellar wind , and @xmath19 is the dimensionless mean photon energy of the stellar radiation field . for ls  5039 , @xmath20  ergs  s@xmath9 , @xmath21  ev , @xmath22/yr , and @xmath23  km  s@xmath9 @xcite , which yields @xmath24 , where @xmath25  cm .",

    "[ flux_tau ] .",
    "the flux dip around @xmath89 is accompanied by a hardening of the vhe @xmath0-ray spectrum .    because the bulk speed of microquasar jets is typically only mildly relativistic ( @xmath90 ) , in dramatic contrast to blazars",
    ", one might also need to consider the possibility of vhe @xmath0-rays emanating from the counter jet .",
    "thus , we have done a study as described above , for an inclination angle of @xmath91 . while the results for this case are qualitatively very similar to the @xmath60 case , the resulting @xmath1 opacities are typically larger by a factor of @xmath92  3 for photon production sites at @xmath93  cm , as expected because of the more favorable photon collision angle and the line of sight passing by the star closer than for the approaching - jet case .",
    "because of the stronger absorption of @xmath0 rays from the counter jet throughout the binary orbit , and the reduction in the flux due to doppler deboosting , the counter jet is unlikely to enhance the @xmath1 absorption signature in the signal appreciably . as for @xmath60 , @xmath1 absorption effects become negligible for @xmath78 .",
    "we have presented a detailed analysis of the effect of @xmath1 absorption of vhe @xmath0-rays near the base of the jet of a microquasar by the intense photon field of a high - mass stellar companion .",

    "\\(2 ) for vhe photon production sites at @xmath95 , the @xmath1 opacity  and , thus , the vhe @xmath0-ray flux  would be strongly modulated on the orbital period of the binary system ( @xmath57  d in the case of ls  5039 ) . at orbital phases close to @xmath69",
    ", the intrinsic vhe @xmath0-ray flux would still be virtually unabsorbed even for @xmath96  cm .",
    "\\(3 ) the orbital modulation of the vhe @xmath0-ray flux would be characterized by a spectral hardening in the @xmath97  gev  1  tev range during flux dips . at lower energies",
    ", the spectrum softens with decreasing flux .",
    "the hess collaboration has reported no evidence for either flaring or periodic variability from ls 5039 @xcite , although @xcite suggest that there is weak evidence for variability of the hess emission with the orbital period .",
    "periodic variability may also be indicated by x - ray observations @xcite of ls 5039 .",
    "\\(a ) as a consequence of the substantial eccentricity of the orbit , the rate of mass transfer from the stellar companion to the compact object , which is believed to be dominated by wind accretion , is likely to be periodically modulated .",
    "this modulation would also be expected to appear at radio and x - ray energies .",
    "\\(b ) analogous to the phase - dependent modulation of the incidence angle for @xmath1 absorption , this geometrical effect would also yield a more favorable angle for compton scattering of starlight photons into the @xmath0-ray regime at phases @xmath89 .",
    "\\(c ) the orientation of the jet may also be mis - aligned with respect to the normal of the orbital plane @xcite and possibly precessing about the normal @xcite , leading to additional modulations , including a changing doppler boosting factor .",
    "effect ( a ) would be expected to lead to an overall hardening of the @xmath0-ray spectrum at all energies with increasing @xmath0-ray flux , while ( b ) would lead to an overall softening throughout the gev ",
    "tev photon energy range because of the klein - nishina cutoff becoming noticeable at lower observed photon energies with increasing flux .",
    "both effects are in contrast to the @xmath1 absorption trough investigated in this _",
    "letter_. a stationary misalignment of the jet could lead to a slight enhancement of the orbital modulation ( if the jet makes a smaller angle with the line of sight than the orbital - motion axis ) or reduce it ( in the opposite case ) , but would not change our results qualitatively .",
    "a @xmath0-ray flux modulation due to jet precession can easily be disentangled from the orbital modulation since the precession period is generally different from the orbital period , so that its effect would average out when folding observational data with the orbital period . consequently",
    ", a measurement of a non - thermal absorption trough at vhe @xmath0-ray energies modulated with the orbital period would firmly establish the importance of @xmath1 absorption effects and thus place a robust limit on the distance @xmath37 of the vhe @xmath0-ray production site in ls 5039 .",
