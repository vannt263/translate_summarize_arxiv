    "the field of hot or warm and dense matter ( hdm / wdm ) is of central importance in astrophysics , where the interior of the sun , as well as other main sequence stars , is composed of similar atomic plasma . in recent years , extreme thermodynamic conditions are achieved terrestrially using large scale experimental facilities , such as the z - machine at sandia national laboratories , or the national ignition facility ( nif ) , where plasma can be produced at local thermodynamic equilibrium with temperatures of the order of @xmath3 .",
    "tackling the many - body problem of atoms in these conditions is difficult , despite the simplicity of the underlying coulomb potential . in order to solve this problem , one resorts to different approximations of the many - body quantum problem .",
    "a different approach , whose foundations lie in density functional theory ( dft ) , is to formulate the problem in terms of the mean electron density .",
    "this is particularly useful when studying thermodynamic properties of a gas of atoms , at finite temperature and density .",
    "the first example of a density functional formulation of the atom has in fact been achieved long before the development of dft in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) model @xcite .",
    "it is based on a semi - classical treatment of the electrons in the atom .",
    "soon after its derivation , the zero - temperature model has been corrected to include quantum gradient corrections to the kinetic energy and exchange effects @xcite .",
    "scott , and following studies , have investigated the limits of the semi - classical approximation , by separating the strongly bound electrons from the semi - classical integration @xcite .",
    "the basic tf model , as well as the gradient and exchange corrections , were generalized to finite temperature and densities.@xcite .",
    "these generalizations were combined with the ion - sphere model . in this model , the atom is enclosed in a spherically symmetric cell that contains all the electrons of the atoms to ensure neutrality .",
    "such models define an electron - density distribution that obeys self - consistency , assuming exact cancellation of the free - electron and other ion densities beyond the sphere @xcite .",
    "the tf model is a very crude and basic approximation for the atom , but its foundations are basic principles of physics , and in fact it is exact at @xmath4 @xcite , with @xmath5 the number of protons in the nucleus of the atom .",
    "moreover , all physical properties predicted by tf model have a simple scaling property with @xmath5 . tf model",
    "thus provides a universal description of all materials , differing only by a scaling factor .",
    "the development of kohn - sham dft ( ks - dft ) @xcite has highlighted the advantages of the tf model .",
    "ks - dft ensures that the ground state properties of a quantum many body system are dictated by its density .",
    "however , ks - dft does not hint towards the structure of the density functional that governs the system properties . as a result",
    ", tf model is commonly used as the limit for phenomenological dft models of heavy atoms @xcite , as tf depends merely on densities by construction .",
    "moreover , generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the kinetic energy and an accurate exchange - correlation term , have been derived as corrections of the finite temperature tf model using orbital free dft ( ofdft ) @xcite . a different approach to the corrections to tf model",
    "was taken by schwinger and englert @xcite . studying a tf description of an isolated atom , i.e. , a zero temperature model , they systematically ordered the corrections to the leading tf model by their @xmath5 dependence .",
    "they demonstrated that scott s correction , i.e. , a quantum treatment of the strongly bound electrons , is the leading correction to tf model , suppressed by @xmath1 .",
    "other corrections , such as quantum and exchange , are of lower order , suppressed by @xmath2 .    in the current paper",
    "we develop a generalization of scott s correction to the finite temperature and density tf model .",
    "we show that it is more dominant than the known quantum and exchange - correlation corrections , and thus conjecture that it is the leading correction at these thermodynamic conditions . as such",
    ", our study is the initial step to establish a systematic order of density functionals , whose different predictions represent the uncertainty in predictions .",
    "we start by considering the assumptions leading to the tf model for a neutral atom of charge @xmath5 at finite temperature @xmath6 and chemical potential @xmath7 . the single electron hamiltonian is @xmath8 neglecting exchange and correlations contributions , the single particle internal energy is @xmath9 where the electronic density is the fermi - dirac distribution .",
    "the total entropy can be calculated combinatorially to be @xmath10 where @xmath11 is boltzmann constant .",
    "summing all the single particle energies leads to double counting of the electrostatic energy between the electrons , thus we subtract it once , and write the free - energy functional as @xcite @xmath12 when a term for the entropy was also added .",
    "the tf main approximation is to evaluate the free energy functional by taking a semi - classical trace over the states , i.e. , @xmath13 after @xmath14 integration , @xmath15 here @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the fermi - dirac integral .",
    "the advantage of writing the tf model in terms in this novel way is that a variation of this functional leads to two self - consistent relations .",
    "a variation with respect to @xmath7 leads to the number constraint , @xmath18 with @xmath19 variation with respect to the potential leads to poisson equation @xmath20 these two equations of the tf model at finite temperature and density are solved as in @xcite , using the approximated ion - sphere model , by setting a finite radius to the atom @xmath21 and determining the following boundary conditions @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the cell radius @xmath21 is determined by the wigner - seitz cell , i.e. , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the avogadro number @xmath26 is the atomic mass and @xmath27 is the plasma density .",
    "we also assume a point nucleus at the center of the atom with the boundary condition @xmath28 .",
    "we turn our attention to a new way to extract the scaling of the tf energy in @xmath5 . in this subsection",
    "we use hartree atomic units .",
    "we define @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31    we rescale : @xmath32 @xmath33 , @xmath34 @xmath35 . in order to comply with the boundary condition at @xmath36 , which yields @xmath37 we must have @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , we rescale @xmath7 in the following manner @xmath39 for later convenience . for the neutral atom case , @xmath40",
    ", we have @xmath41 we first note that @xmath42    this is a partial differential equation we need to solve in order to get @xmath43 . if one chooses @xmath44 , the rhs of eq .",

    "thus , eq . ( [ eq:302 ] )",
    "is simplified @xmath46 using the characteristics method we get @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the universal function of the tf model and , @xmath49 when @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we recover that @xmath52 which is the known zero temperature result .    in order to get this result",
    "we must have @xmath53 when @xmath54 is the scaled potential @xmath55 .",
    "we also must have @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the universal coefficient of the chemical potential . in order to expand v close to the nucleus ,",
    "we define @xmath58 we expand @xmath59 up to the first order as a series around zero . in order to get a better expansion",
    "we need to turn to baker s expansion due to the fact that @xmath60 is not continuous at @xmath36 @xcite . in the first order we have @xmath61 when @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we recover that @xmath62",
    "one of the shortcomings of the tf model are unphysical properties near the nucleus .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the semi - classical approximation breaks near the nucleus , as the electrons wavelength becomes comparable to the distance to the nucleus .",
    "this effectively imposes an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath63 on the semi - classical trace .",
    "however , such a cutoff neglects the energy of strongly bound electrons .",
    "we incorporate the strongly bound electrons perturbatively into the tf model by subtracting the semi - classical summation above the ultraviolet cutoff , and adding the quantum mechanical trace of the strongly bound electrons .",
    "we setup a consistent perturbative calculation , thus calculating the trace for the strongly bound electrons using the leading order potential , i.e. , the potential resulting from the tf model . as the inner electrons are strongest bound , we use eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) , i.e. , a coulomb potential , leading to hydrogen atom wave functions and energies , up to the constant @xmath64 .",
    "this approximation is valid for a shell @xmath65 with @xmath66 electrons , if @xmath67 the deviation is at the percentage level for k - shell electrons , and about @xmath68 for l - shell electrons .",
    "finally , @xmath69 we define @xmath70 to be the quantum number of the highest energy level smaller than @xmath71 .",
    "in addition , we introduced @xmath72 , the semi - classical subtraction of the energy of particles whose energy is smaller than @xmath63 .",
    "we use @xmath73 the fermi - dirac distribution with chemical potential @xmath63 in order to select the electrons with energy less than @xmath63 .",
    "we assumed that these electrons , which are very close to the nucleus , and strongly bound , are not influenced by the heat reservoir .",
    "thus , we can treat them as if they were at zero temperature .",
    "we checked this numerically and saw no change in the result within the regime of validity of the presented model .",
    "@xmath71 is chosen in the gap between the k - shell and l - shell , aiming to use a quantum mechanical treatment for the k - shell , i.e. , @xmath74 ( therefore @xmath75 ) , where @xmath76 as a result , @xmath77 complying with the assumption that the strongly bound electrons fill complete shells , without fluctuations , dictates @xmath78 .    taking the trace in eq .",

    "a variation of this functional with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath82 leads to the number constraint and to the poisson equation .",
    "however , the electron density is now divided to the density of strongly bound electrons and the rest of the electrons , @xmath83 with @xmath84 when we define @xmath85 and @xmath86 this correction , due to the strongly bound electrons , clearly does not change the chemical potential , since the correction does not change the dependence of the functional upon the number of electrons .    a lengthy analytical derivation in appendix",
    "a , using the characteristics method , leads to the scaling properties of the model ( in hartree atomic units ) , @xmath87 predicting that the prefactor to scott s @xmath88 term is density and temperature independent .",

    "[ fig:10 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] , where we demonstrate the scaling as derived from the free energy , and invariant of the scaled temperature @xmath89 .",
    "similar constant behavior is verified for the ( scaled ) density @xmath90 .",
    "this is due to the neglect of temperature and density effects on the k shell electrons .",
    "the scaling clearly shows that the generalized scott s correction is suppressed by @xmath1 , with respect to the bare tf result .",
    "moreover , as @xmath91 , the coefficient goes to @xmath92 monotonically , validating our analytic derivation .    .",
    "accomplished for @xmath93 and @xmath94 . essentially no dependence is found .",

    "we have established a consistent method to estimate a @xmath1 correction to the tf energy at finite thermodynamic conditions , in a functional form .",
    "the model is valid as long as the l - shell is not ionized .",
    "we have found that the correction to the tf energy in our regime is as in the cold model , namely @xmath106 .",
    "the strongly bound electrons are not affected by the temperature in our model , because in the temperature scope we are dealing , the most inner electron are not yet affected by the environment .",
    "nonetheless , our model give a finite temperature model that deal with the strongly bound electrons and gives a more accurate result than the zero order finite temperature tf .",
    "the model presented here takes into account the electron screening potential when dealing with the strongly bound electrons .",
    "this accounts for the differences comparing to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when comparing our model to ks - dft we see that ks - dft deals with the strongly bound electron automatically .",
    "however , in ks - dft deriving an order by order correction to a functional is challenging . in addition , our ofdft model can help build better functionals for ks - dft using the physical knowledge acquire in our research . above all",
    ", our model is highly efficient computationally with respect to ks - dft .",
    "the results lead us to conjecture that tfs correction is the leading correction for the tf model at finite temperature .",
    "in particular due to the fact that gradient and exchange - correlation corrections to the tf energy are of order @xmath107 @xcite . as",
    "such , it is essential to include the tfs correction as a starting point when studying these further corrections , as well as relativistic corrections .",
    "such successive construction of functionals will allow to better estimate theoretical uncertainties and will be used to derive equations of state and compute opacity in wdm in a low computational effort .",
    "furthermore , the potential of the model can be used a pseudo - potential in molecular dynamics calculations . moreover ,",
    "the understanding of the importance of each correction to the relevant physical problem can help build ks - dft functionals that are more accurate and are relevant for the problem at hand .    in future work , we intend to investigate different modeling of the plasma environment surrounding the ions @xcite going beyond the ion - sphere model to corrections such as short range ion - ion and electron - ion correlations . including such correlations",
    "becomes important as the plasma parameter grows .",
    "in addition , we intend to extend the validity regime of the model to higher temperatures , which will demand , among other corrections , a finite temperature treatment for the strongly bound electrons .",
    "furthermore , we will add gradient , exchange - correlation and relativistic corrections to our model .",
    "the authors thank samuel b. trickey for valuable comments on earlier versions of this paper .",
    "e.  s.  thanks the hospitality of the university of florida during the completion of this work .",
    "in this appendix we will attain the @xmath5 scaling properties of the correction we suggested .",
    "we use hartree atomic unit in this part . we define    @xmath108    @xmath109    and    @xmath110    thus , the energy functional from eq .",
