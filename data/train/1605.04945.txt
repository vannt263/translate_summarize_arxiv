    "in the present work we treated regimes of hyper- and high - inflation in economy . in a previous work @xcite it has been found that for a weak hyperinflation , like e.g. that developed in israel , was impossible to determine a value of @xmath2 within the frame of the nlf model .",
    "this model is based on a power law with an exponent @xmath1 , see eq .",
    "( [ rate00 ] ) . the mentioned drawback has been attributed to a permanent but incomplete effort for stopping inflation .",
    "therefore , in the present work we suggested to include in the theory information on saturation by introducing a parameter @xmath3 , which multiplies all the past inflation growth rates .",
    "this parameter would account for the effort done by the government for coping inflation .    in the extended approach , enlf , reported in the present paper",
    "the solutions for gri and cpi are also analytic as in the nlf model .",

    "it is pertinent to notice that @xmath9 appears in a variety of mathematical and physical problems . for @xmath7",
    "this hypergeometric function diverges leading to a finite time singularity , from which a value of @xmath2 can be determined . the same singularity is present in eq.([rate57 ] ) for gri .",

    "the episodes occurred in mexico and iceland are reported in the present work .",
    "data of both series of inflation can be described , as in the case of israel , with the lf model .",
    "however , the enlf(@xmath2 ) model also provides additional solutions forecasting possible blow up of the economies in case the high inflation regimes would become spirals of hyperinflation .",
    "the corresponding fits are very good and the predicted values of @xmath2 for crashes are acceptable .    the phenomena of multiple equilibria , a known feature in models of economics , appears due to the fact that the introduction of @xmath3 enlarges the dimension of the @xmath101 hyper - surface , which now also presents minimums in domains where the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath6 are not strongly correlated .",
    "so , we can state that the parameter @xmath3 allows a more complete representation of inflationary processes .",
    "it is interesting to note that the exponent of the nonlinear feedback of inflation can be controlled by a parameter multiplying the growth rate .",
