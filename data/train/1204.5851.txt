    "<S> we investigate electronic transport in epitaxial fe(100)/mgo / fe / mgo / fe double magnetic tunnel junctions with soft barrier breakdown ( hot spots ) . </S>",

    "<S> the room - temperature oscillations have been observed in both parallel and antiparallel magnetic configurations and for both bias polarizations . * * a simple model of tunneling through hot spots in the double barrier magnetic junction is proposed to explain qualitatively this effect .    </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical predictions @xcite followed by experimental observations of coherent tunneling in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) with mgo barriers @xcite * * have busted research of @xmath0 mtjs @xcite ( here @xmath1 and @xmath2 are ferromagnetic layers and @xmath3 - insulating barrier ) , and opened new perspectives of their applications in spintronic devices . for thin enough electrodes , electron tunneling may reveal resonant features due to quantum well states ( qws ) . </S>",
    "<S> early studies explored the simplest way to realize resonant tunneling by growing a thin nonmagnetic layer ( nm )  between ferromagnetic electrode and barrier in standard mtj structures @xmath4 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , resonant tunneling in double mtjs ( dmtjs ) @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is central layer ) may have advantages in comparison with the standard mtjs , mainly due to their enhanced tunnelling magnetoresistance ( tmr ) @xcite and resonant  spin - torque effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> tmr in dmtjs only weakly varies at low bias voltages @xcite , which is crucial for applications . </S>",
    "<S> last but not least , the current driven magnetization reversal in dmtjs occurs at relatively low current densities @xcite .    in dmtjs </S>",
    "<S> the qws can strongly influence electron transport only if the _ </S>",
    "<S> _ f__@xmath7 layer has submonolayer roughness and its thickness exceeds 1 nm minimizing coulomb blockade ( cb )  effects @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the _ </S>",
    "<S> _ f__@xmath7 layer should also be thin enough so that energy separation of qws substantially exceeds the thermal energy . </S>",
    "<S> these conditions are hardly fulfilled in the macroscopic dmtjs @xcite , where resonant tunneling was not observed mainly due to the absence of the atomically flat surfaces over entire junction lateral dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for a local tunneling through qws in the central fe layer in @xmath8 junctions was provided by iovan et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite using the point contact technique . </S>",
    "<S> * * recently , nozaki et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite reported on resonant tunneling effects in macroscopic * * dmtjs with fe nano islands incorporated into the thick mgo barrier . </S>",
    "<S> their  results have been interpreted as due to combined qws @xcite and cb effects .    </S>",
    "<S> this letter reports on the detailed study of electron transport in epitaxial macroscopic fe@xmath9/mgo / fe / mgo / fe junctions with _ continuous middle fe layer _ and current flowing through the hot spots. oscillatory conductance and tmr with applied voltage present clear signatures of the local coherent tunneling through qws . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations have been observed in _ both parallel and antiparallel magnetic configurations and for both bias polarizations _ , contrary to ref.@xcite where they were seen only in the parallel configuration and for one current orientation . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we observe oscillations in the room temperature ( rt ) regime , while in ref.@xcite they were seen mainly at low temperatures . finally , the technique we used for their observation is also different and makes use of some features of breakdown junctions , which allow to observe _ quantum oscillations in a continuous layer_. our results have been explained within a simple model which assumes formation of single or multiple hot spots  .    </S>",
    "<S> the junctions under study have the following structure :  mgo//mgo@xmath10 /v@xmath11 /cr@xmath12 /co@xmath13 /fe@xmath14 /mgo@xmath15 /fe@xmath13 /mgo@xmath15 /fe@xmath10 /co@xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> /pd@xmath10 /au@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the mtj stacks were grown by molecular - beam epitaxy with the base pressure of 5@xmath1710@xmath18 torr in the presence of atomic nitrogen . the mgo barrier and the fe layers </S>",
    "<S> were grown at rt . </S>",
    "<S> the fe was annealed to 450@xmath19 for flattening . </S>",
    "<S> the high resolution cross - sectional tem  images ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1@xmath20 )  generally corroborate the good structural quality and homogeneity of dmtjs . </S>",
    "<S> since the tem images are deduced from inverse fourier transform of a diffraction pattern integrated across the sample thickness , the amorphous zones , if present , add a diffuse backgound to the diffraction pattern of the single crystal zones . </S>",
    "<S> more details of standard double barrier samples growth may be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the specificity of the samples studied here is a nitrogen doping of all the layers achieved during the growth , with a nitrogen concentration roughly estimated to less than 2% . </S>",
    "<S> although further studies are needed to determine the concentration of nitrogen inside mgo , recent report @xcite * * revealed * * that mgo  barrier in mtjs may be doped up to 2.5% of nitrogen without changes in the crystalline structure . in our samples , </S>",
    "<S> the structural analysis by rheed , auger spectroscopy and magnetometry demonstrate that , despite the nitrogen doping ( as evidenced from auger , see fig.1b ) , the structural and magnetic properties are not affected . </S>",
    "<S> the rheed patterns of fe and mgo ( not presented here ) are identical to those of nitrogen - free samples . </S>",
    "<S> what is important for the studies presented in this paper is that , from electrical transport point of view , the barrier doping by nitrogen is responsible for local soft dielectric breakdown @xcite with reduced breakdown voltage . </S>",
    "<S> this may be expected to keep barrier and central fe electrode compositions nearly unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> after the mbe growth of the multilayer stack , the mtj structures were patterned to 10@xmath21 by uv lithography and ar - ion etching , step - by - step controlled in situ by auger .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2@xmath20 shows the rt magnetization measured with magnetic field along the fe easy ( 100 ) axis ( * ea)*. one observes well defined transitions of the three distinct fe layers . </S>",
    "<S> this is indirect indication of epitaxy and conservation of magnetic properties ( fourfold anisotropy ) for nitrogen doped fe . </S>",
    "<S> the zero bias tmr is close to 30% ( fig.2b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> application of the bias exceeding roughly 500 mv leads to breakdown of the junctions , which in turn reduces zero - bias tmr down to about 4% ( see figs . </S>",
    "<S> 2@xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> two other observations indicate indirectly that this breakdown decreases the effective mgo  barrier height most probably by transforming locally nearly crystalline mgo  regions near a hot - spot into amorphous . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the coercive field of the central free fe layer remains unchanged after breakdown ( h@xmath7=45 oe ) , while coercive fields of the upper and bottom electrodes increase substantially about 50% . </S>",
    "<S> these changes are most probably due to hardening of the fe / co interfaces by high current density close to the hot - spot. the second indication for the possible amorphization of the mgo barrier during the breakdown with intact middle electrode is our experimental observation of the signature of qws in the electron transport in some of the broken dmtjs which we discuss below .    we have carried out detailed study of the rt resistance as a function of  magnetic field with three different field orientations :  * ea * , the hard ( 110 ) axis -*ha * , and in intermediate axis ( * ia * ) situated approximately at 10 degrees from the * ea*. here we present results obtained at bias voltages up to 1.5v and with the steps of 25mv for those broken dmtjs which showed reproducible signatures of the changes in the resistance with bias ( fig.3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the zero bias tmr varies substantially along the three mentioned directions . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , tmr is reduced along * ia * in comparison with * ea * and * ha * directions , where transitions in all three magnetic layers as indicated by arrows are reflected in the tmr . _ </S>",
    "<S> _ we shall concentrate further on the electron transport data obtained with field along * ha * and * ia *  directions , where the largest relative changes in tmr  vs. bias were observed .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 3@xmath20 shows typical bias dependence of the resistance @xmath23 for parallel ( p ) and antiparallel ( ap ) states with magnetic field along * ha*. one observes oscillatory behavior of r and tmr  with a period close to 150mv in both p and ap states . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that these oscillations , more clearly resolved for negative bias when current flows from the upper to bottom electrodes ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3@xmath24 ) , have period that is in reasonable agreement with the predictions by wang _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figures 3a , c mark with arrows the majority spin qws energies calculated within about 1v above ( red ) and below ( black ) the fermi energy @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the absolute values of tmr measured with the field along * ia *  are reduced in comparison with those for the fields along * ea * and * ha * , the relative changes of the tmr  with bias are substantially enhanced ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3__b,__@xmath25 ) ) . in order to understand this effect </S>",
    "<S> we remind that the measurements of tunnel resistance with the field along * ia *  are usually observed @xcite * * to be most sensitive to small variations in the angle between magnetizations of the fixed and free layers in comparison with * ea * and * ha *  configurations . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest here that the strongest relative changes in tmr(v ) for the * ia *  configuration could be a consequence of local spin - torque effects which are predicted to be enhanced with intermediate alignment of the ferromagnetic layers @xcite . figures 4 @xmath26 represent 3d plots of tmr vs magnetic field and bias with magnetic fields applied along * ha * and * ia *  respectively . </S>",
    "<S> dependence of tmr  on bias is observed to be more asymmetric with field along * ia *  ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> 4 @xmath26 ) , which is in agreement with possible influence of local spin torque effects in the breakdown regions .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss physical mechanisms which could be behind the main experimental findings . </S>",
    "<S> before breakdown , the current is roughly uniform across the junction area and weak interface disorder might introduce decoherence suppressing the effects due to qws . the soft breakdown of the doped mgo may create defects and local amorphization which locally reduce the mgo barriers leading to hot spots which connect fe and fe / co leads with the central fe layer . with hot spots of sufficiently small lateral dimensions , electrons tunneling to the central layer </S>",
    "<S> can sample well defined structure of qws due to lack of decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining part of the macroscopic dmtj provides then some averaged featureless background signal . </S>",
    "<S> the feasibility of the above scenario is qualitatively supported by the good correspondence of the observed periodic variations in r vs.v and the theory taking into account qws formed within 4.6 nm thick central fe electrode @xcite ( see figure 3a , c ) .    in order to describe the observed features </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a dmtj ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c , d ) with barriers including a number of hot spots. the average conductance of the structure is @xcite @xmath27where @xmath28 is the conductance due to a single @xmath29-th spot , @xmath30 is the probability of realization of a certain configuration of the @xmath29-th spot , and @xmath31 is a set of parameters characterizing this configuration . </S>",
    "<S> let us assume that a particular hot spot is characterized by its lateral dimension @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the current through the spot can be then calculated as @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the normal and lateral wavevector components of the incoming wave ( layer 1 ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the normal components of the wavevectors in layers 2 and 3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> here we assumed that the in - plane component of @xmath36 is conserved for tunneling from layer 2 to 3 , whereas for tunneling through the spot there is no conservation of the in - plane component due to broken translational symmetry , and the scattering can be described by an angle distribution function @xmath37 . in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> we use the approximation @xmath38 , which means that scattering to the state with large in - plane component @xmath39 is effectively suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( 1 ) includes transmission probabilities @xmath40 and @xmath41 for tunneling from the layer 1 to 2 , and from 2 to 3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the sum over @xmath34 runs over discrete values satisfying the quantization condition @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be emphasized that this condition is related only to thickness @xmath43 of the layer 2 and is the same for any other hot spot.    calculating the integral over @xmath44 we find @xmath45 the conductance @xmath46 as a function of bias @xmath47 for a single spot is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4e for different values of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we assumed @xmath48  nm , the barrier width @xmath49  nm , @xmath50  ev , and the barrier height @xmath51  ev . as we see , the oscillation peaks related to the level quantization in the layer 2 are more pronounced for wide spots , and they are effectively damped for small @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the small spot enables tunneling with nonconserved in - plane component of the wave vector .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into account tunneling from many different spots , we obtain qualitatively the same picture corresponding to a mean value of @xmath20 , and proportional to the number of spots . </S>",
    "<S> the total conductance of the structure includes a constant non - oscillating part , @xmath52 , related to the tunneling without spots . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4f we present resistance calculated as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the number of spots and @xmath55 is the mean value of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the variation of barrier heights at the spot does not affect the position of peaks and does not change the shape of peaks , changing only the amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> thus , averaging over randomly distributed @xmath20 and barrier heights @xmath56 gives a picture like for a single spot with some mean values of @xmath20 and @xmath56 .    </S>",
    "<S> the applicability of the above model requires a number of conditions . </S>",
    "<S> although location of the oscillation peaks does not depend on the spot dimension ( @xmath20 ) , the hot spot should not exceed average dimensions over which central electrode is atomically flat . </S>",
    "<S> also , as seen from fig.4e , f , decreasing the parameter @xmath20 makes oscillations less visible ( damped ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we expect the hot spots to be roughly of _ nm _ lateral size . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , if magnetic moment of one or two layers is reversed ( ap alignment , ) the resistance becomes very large because the minority @xmath57 band will be displaced well above the fermi energy . </S>",
    "<S> however realistically speaking the hot spot region of the mgo barrier may be not fully epitaxial either due to structural defects and/or nitrogen doping . </S>",
    "<S> this can strongly reduce spin filtering by the @xmath57 band in the ap alignment , substantially suppressing tmr in real dmtjs with hot spots.    in conclusion , we have presented evidence for local resonant tunneling through quantum well states in the middle continuous free layer of a double magnetic tunnel junction . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillations have been observed at room temperature in both parallel and antiparallel magnetic configurations and for both bias polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> owing to specific features of the breakdown junctions , we were able to observe quantum well states in continuous magnetic layers . to observe similar effects in the nitrogen free dmtj </S>",
    "<S> , the junction area should be smaller than the size of terraces of the fe central layer . </S>",
    "<S> understanding of electron transport in magnetic tunnel junctions with defects and hot spots is of great importance both from fundamental and applied points of view . </S>",
    "<S> recent reports link spin torque oscillations with record low bandwidth to the presence of defects and hot spots inside the mgo barrier of mtjs @xcite .    </S>",
