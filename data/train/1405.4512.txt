    "over the past few decades , the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft )  @xcite and its extensions  @xcite have proven to be successful in describing the dynamic properties of strongly correlated systems . in dmft",
    ", a lattice model is mapped onto a corresponding quantum impurity model such as the anderson impurity model .",
    "the impurity self - energy , which is obtained by solving the quantum impurity model , is identified with that of the lattice model , imposing a self - consistency relation . here",
    ", we assume that the self - energy is local ; this is the case in infinite spatial dimensions and provides a good approximation in high dimensions .",
    "the efficiency of the dmft depends strongly on the method of solving the quantum impurity problem , which is called _ an impurity solver_. some perturbative methods such as iterative perturbation theory  @xcite and the noncrossing approximation  @xcite were proposed and turned out to yield qualitatively correct results . for a quantitatively accurate description , however , nonperturbative methods must be developed .",
    "one of the reliable nonperturbative tools is the hirsch - fye quantum monte carlo method  @xcite , which is useful at finite temperatures . in that method",
    ", however , the discretization of the imaginary - time axis raises difficulties in capturing the sharp variation of the imaginary - time green function , particularly at low temperatures .",
    "such a problem can be resolved by using the recently - developed continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ctqmc ) method , which performs a stochastic sampling of an expansion order in the imaginary - time axis without any discretization  @xcite .",
    "we here intend to examine the finite - temperature mott transition in the hubbard model , which is well known to exhibit the characteristic features of the mott transition  @xcite .",
    "previous extensive studies help us to understand the qualitative nature of the mott transition in the hubbard model : there exists a critical temperature above which only a smooth crossover occurs between a metal and a mott insulator  @xcite . below the critical temperature , in contrast",
    ", a coexistence region separates the metallic from the mott insulating phase  @xcite , which implies that the system undergoes a first - order phase transition somewhere inside the coexistence region  @xcite .",
    "our work focuses on the numerical determination of a phase transition line ( ptl ) of the first - order mott transition .",
    "we can determine a thermodynamically - stable phase from the criterion of the lowest free energy .",
    "also , at finite temperatures , the entropy makes important contributions .",
    "although the qmc method is very useful at finite temperatures , obtaining the entropy directly from the qmc method is very difficult .",
    "accordingly , numerical computation of the ptl has been a challenging problem .",
    "only a few earlier studies here made efforts to obtain the ptl by using exact diagonalization  @xcite or hirsch - fye qmc method  @xcite , and a recent ctqmc study succeeded in locating a single transition point at a very low temperature  @xcite .    in this paper , we present a reliable numerical scheme for estimating the ptl of the mott transition at low temperatures .",
    "we basically use the same differential equation as in ref .  .",
    "however , in contrast to that previous study , where some fitting functions were introduced  @xcite , we measure the quantities for the equation directly by using the ctqmc method without any additional manipulation . we show that our method results in the ptl which is fully consistent with earlier finite - temperature studies .",
    "we also demonstrate that our finite - temperature result approaches gradually the zero - temperature result when we systematically include low - temperature calculations . finally , the resulting ptl is found not to be changed significantly by the next - order correction to some approximations that are made while solving the differential equation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  ii is devoted to the description of the hubbard model and the dmft combined with the ctqmc method .",
