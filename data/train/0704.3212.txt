    "the ability to easily control charge and spin transport is of great importance in nanotechnology , specifically spintronics .",
    "the quantum dot aharonov - bohm interferometer ( qd - abi ) ( figure  [ fig : experiment ] ) has been found to be a candidate for manipulating electron spins  @xcite . in recent years",
    "a number of theories  @xcite have been put forth to take advantage of the interference effects in such a geometry .",
    "sun and xie  @xcite showed that the spin polarization on the qd may be controlled via the voltage bias . in the presence of a local coulomb interaction on the qd hofstetter _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite studied the dependence of the fano line shape on the ab phase .    in this paper",
    "we show that the addition of a spin - orbit ( so ) interaction on the strongly correlated qd allows the qd - abi to function as a spin - charge filter . the ability of this system to act as a filter is a consequence of the interference between the continuum ( ab arm ) and the localized state ( qd ) , which is known as the fano effect  @xcite . aside from the qd - abi",
    "the fano effect has been observed in a single electron transistor  @xcite , a quantum wire with a side coupled qd  @xcite , and multiwall carbon nanotubes in a crossed geometry  @xcite .",
    "the presence of the ab arm tends to localize electrons on the qd , depending on how strongly the arm is coupled to the system .",
    "therefore this property will give us an effective control over the strength of these correlations on the qd .",
    "we may exploit this tuning of the many - body physics to control the charge - spin transport of the qd - abi system .",
    "the qd interactions we will study in this paper are an on - site coulomb interaction and the rashba spin - orbit interaction  @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction in the kondo regime will allow us to filter both charge and spin at zero bias .",
    "the reason for this is due to the fact that the kondo effect induces a sharp resonance in the qd spectral function at the fermi energy .",
    "the further addition of the so interaction , which is induced by the application of a gate potential , for a single orbital qd , will create a spin dependent phase factor  @xcite in the ab arm tunneling coefficient .    often the spin - orbit interaction is considered a coupling with spin degrees of freedom mediated by interlevel transitions in quantum dot systems and therefore , due to the significant level spacing and the coulomb interaction , the inter - level so coupling strengths in qd systems are thought to be small . however , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , an intra - level phase factor induced by the so coupling may be realized in high @xmath2-factor systems  @xcite such as ingaas quantum dots . without the interference effect , _ eg . _ without the ab - arm , such effect can be ignored .",
    "however , the presence of the ab - arm not only manifests the intra - level so interference effects but also effectively controls the many - body effects on the qd , hence a strong influence on the charge - spin transport .",

    "secondly , the noninteracting system is not suitable for controlling both charge and spin transport .",
