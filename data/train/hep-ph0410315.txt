    "the discovery of an exotic @xmath0 pentaquark by leps at spring-8,@xcite subsequently confirmed by many other groups , marked a new era for testing our understanding of the hadron spectroscopy and promoted a re - examination of the qcd implications for exotic hadrons .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 is of order 1535 mev and its width is less than 10 mev from direct observations and can be as narrow as 1 mev or even lower.@xcite many null results for the pentaquark search mostly from high energy experiments have also been reported .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath0 pentaquark is real , it must be established beyond any doubt .    if the @xmath0 pentaquark exists , its minimum quark content is @xmath1 . to understand those experimental measurements with positive results",
    ", we are facing three puzzles : ( i ) the doubly charged partner of @xmath0 , namely , @xmath2 with the quark content @xmath3 , should be easily detected via the decay @xmath4 .",
    "the puzzle is why is it not seen so far while stringent limits have been set ?",
    "( ii ) the naive constituent quark model in which quarks are uncorrelated implies a @xmath0 pentaquark mass of order 1900 mev .",
    "why is it so anomalously light ?",
    "( iii ) the fall - apart strong decay @xmath5 is ozi super - allowed .",
    "hence , if quarks in @xmath0 are uncorrelated , the width will be of order several hundred mev .",
    "why is the observed @xmath0 width so narrow ?",
    "these puzzles hint at a possible correlation among various quarks ; two or three quarks could form a cluster .",
    "a popular correlated quark model has been advocated by jaffe and wilczek @xcite in which the @xmath0 is a bound state of an @xmath6 quark with two @xmath7 diquarks .",
    "the diquark is a highly correlated spin - zero object and is in a flavor anti - triplet and color anti - triplet state .",
    "bose statistics of the scalar diquarks requires that the diquark pairs be in an orbital @xmath8 wave state .",
    "the parity of @xmath0 is predicted to be positive owing to the diquark correlation .",
    "consider the strong decay @xmath9 .",
    "it can proceed through two processes : fall - apart decay with quark annihilation and the kaon emission process .",
    "the latter is expected to be severely suppressed ( except in the infinite momentum frame where quark annihilation and annihilation are prohibited ) as it involves the transition between @xmath0 and the 5-quark component of the nucleon .",
    "the fall - apart process is quite unique to the pentaquark and it can not occur in the ordinary baryon decays . as mentioned before , if quarks are uncorrelated , the fall - apart mechanism will yield a width of several hundred mev .",
    "therefore , quark correlation is needed to suppress the ozi supper - allowed process . in the jaffe - wilczek model , this suppression can be understood as follows .",
    "first , one has to break the @xmath10 diquark pair so that one of the light quarks will combine with the @xmath6 quark to form a kaon .",
    "second , one has to overcome the @xmath8-wave potential barrier so that the rest three quarks form a @xmath11-wave nucleon .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 decay width is narrow due to the breaking of diquarks and the transformation of the @xmath12-wave into @xmath11-wave configurations .    in a typical pentaquark decay to a meson and a baryon ,",
    "the anti - quark is common to both pentaquark and the final state meson . to the leading order of the spectator approximation ,",
    "the anti - quark can be considered as a spectator in the decay process depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "in this picture , there is a @xmath13 subprocess with @xmath14 being a diquark pair and @xmath15 a baryon .",
    "we use the effective hamiltonian @xcite [ eq : heff ] h_eff&= &   _ 5 q^c +   i^_5(q^c ) _ to model the @xmath16 subprocess , where @xmath17 is a characteristic scale of the system .",
    "it turns out that only the @xmath18 term contributes to even - parity pentaquark decays .",
    "although we do not know how to calculate @xmath19 from first - principles calculations , we can determine it from the @xmath20 width , and use it to predict the decay widths of other light and heavy pentaquarks .",
    "1.2 in    for the strong decay @xmath21 , we have calculated the matrix element @xmath22 .",
    "the matrix elements can be expressed in terms of form factors .",
    "we first computed the form factors in the spacelike region and then extrapolated them to the timelike region .",
    "taking 1 mev as a benchmark for the @xmath20 width , it is found that @xmath23 .",
    "we have estimated the strong decays @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 by normalizing to the @xmath0 width .",
    "we found that @xmath24 , @xmath26 and @xmath28decay rates are of the order of a few mev , while @xmath29 decay rates are of order tens of mev.@xcite if we take @xmath30  mev as observed by na49,@xcite we will have @xmath31 which is consistent with the observed width of @xmath32  mev.@xcite",
    "if the light @xmath0 is real , it is expected the existence of the stable heavy pentaquark @xmath33 by replacing @xmath6 by @xmath34 .",
    "whether the heavy pentaquark lies above or below the strong decay threshold is rather controversial . a narrow resonance in @xmath35 mass distribution with mass @xmath36 mev and width",
    "@xmath37 has been reported by h1,@xcite but it has not been confirmed by many other groups . if the heavy pentaquarks lie below the strong decay threshold , they can be searched for only through weak or electromagentic decays .",
    "we apply the relativistic light - front approach to calculate the pentaquark to pentaquark transition form factors.@xcite in the heavy quark limit , heavy - to - heavy pentaquark transition form factors can be expressed in terms of three isgur - wise functions : two of them are found to be normalized to unity at zero recoil , while the third one is equal to 1/2 at the maximum momentum transfer , in accordance with the prediction of the large-@xmath38 approach @xcite or the quark model.@xcite therefore , the light - front model calculations are consistent with the requirement of heavy quark symmetry .",
    "we have calculated form factors and isgur - wise functions in @xcite .",
    "decay rates of the weak decays @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 with @xmath33 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 being the heavy anti - sextet , heavy triplet and light octet pentaquarks , respectively , are obtained . for weakly decaying @xmath45 and @xmath46 , the branching ratios of @xmath47 , @xmath48 are estimated to be at the level of @xmath49 and a few percents , respectively .",
