    "soon thereafter it became clear , however , that the extrapolation of this linear formula from the low - density region upwards , to the neutron star densities , would be highly contentious .    in this paper :",

    "the pion - two - nucleon connected matrix element is substantially more complex : there are more than 50 connected diagrams in the lowest - order perturbative ( born ) approximation .",

    "they are formed either by having a complete pion - nucleon scattering amplitude attached to one external nucleon line , or by having a pion - nucleon vertex attached to two external nucleons in the sum of one meson exchanges between the two nucleons ( the nn potential ) .",
    "this one - meson exchange potential ought to be summed into an infinite ladder by iteration of the bethe - salpeter equation and thus made to form a proper interacting nn ( scattering or bound ) state . in the end , this summation is equivalent to the introduction of nn correlations into the nuclear matter .",
    "these diagrams diverge _ in vacuo _ , although they are born diagrams , because the intermediate nucleons are on their mass shells , due to the external soft - pion condition .",
    "points 1 ) and 2 ) put together lead to @xmath57 for the total . with the currently accepted value of the @xmath50 mass , the second term exceeds the first one .",
    "one feature of this result stands out : the appearance of the second power of the single - nucleon sigma term coming from the repetition of the one - pion reducible diagrams involving the `` primitive '' ( elementary ) single - nucleon sigma term contributions .",
    "it has been pointed out by m. ericson @xcite that this sort of behaviour generalizes to higher orders of perturbation theory , fig . 4 , and that the graphs can be resummed into a geometric progression .",
    "we shall address that question next .",
    "in the foregone analysis one will have noticed that certain lower - order graphs are repeated in the higher ones with simple regularity .",
    "the multiplicities of these graphs can be figured out and the infinite ( sub-)series resummed .",
    "we shall show that several classes of such diagrams .",
    "sum into geometric series .",
    "that result is particularly useful because its properties , such as the radius of convergence and the analytic structure are well known . yet , as we shall show , uncritical application may sometimes lead to erroneous conclusions .

    "it seems obvious that the complete series including all diagrams , at best can have the convergence properties of the worst - behaved sub - series . in other words",
    ", our resummation of the one - nucleon pion rescattering diagrams seems to tell us the maximum reliable density calculable with such diagrammatic methods .",
    "an important practical consequence of the above reasoning and of the empirical value of the kaon - nucleon sigma term @xmath64 = 200 mev is that _ the radius of convergence of the series relevant to the @xmath65-condensation is at best a fraction of one normal nuclear density_. surprisingly , this conclusion turns out to be only qualitatively correct , due to cancellations from other two - nucleon sigma term contributions .",

    "it is clear that the model- and approximation - dependent sign of @xmath81 determines the position of the poles in the complex @xmath0 plane , and in particular if they are on the real axis , or not .",

    "this sort of analysis can and ought to be extended to 3- , 4- , and higher n - pion rescattering graphs .",
    "we close with a _ conjecture _ : in the linear sigma model the 3-nucleon critical density @xmath87 is larger than the two - nucleon one @xmath88 , the 4-n higher @xmath89 than the 3-n one , etc ..",
    "in summary , in this paper we have : ( i ) given an explicit formula for the n@xmath90-order term in the powers - of - density ( @xmath91 ) expansion of the nuclear matter sigma term @xmath7 and of the nuclear matter fermion condensate @xmath47 in particular ; ( ii ) calculated the @xmath92 coefficient in the born approximation to the linear sigma model ; ( iii ) iterated these primitive @xmath92 terms to infinite order ; ( iv ) found poles and radii of convergence associated with two such resummations .",
