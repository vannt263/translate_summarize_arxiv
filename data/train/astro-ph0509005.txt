    "indeed , for a given initial mass function ( imf ) , the total expected amount of metals @xmath11 formed by a given time @xmath12 is simply the integral of the star formation density ( sfd ) @xmath13 times @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is the mean stellar yield @xcite : @xmath15 using a salpeter imf and the type ii stellar yields ( for solar metallicity ) @xmath16 from @xcite , @xcite found that @xmath17 or 2.4% . using the sfh parameterized ( in a lcdm cosmology ) either as in @xcite or by a constant star formation rate ( sfr ) beyond @xmath18 , we find that the total co - moving metal density is @xcite : @xmath19 after integrating the sfh over the redshift @xmath20 range from 4 to 2 .",

    "they concluded that all of the remaining metals ( 80% ) are in the ism of smgs and that the mere existence of smgs is enough to close the metal budget .",

    "these two numbers can be reconciled if smgs are short lived , with a `` duty cycle '' of the order of 0.1 .",
    "nonetheless , the several methods of estimating the duty cycle of smgs agree to within a factor of a few .",

    "high metallicity and large gas fractions are mutually exclusive in chemical evolution models .",
    "@xcite showed that when the gas fraction is much larger than 50% solar metallicity can not be reached .",
    "in addition , the chemical evolution models of @xcite ( used by d03 ) , showed that the stellar contribution to the metal mass budget of smg is small ( approximately 1/4 of eq .",
    "[ metals : genzel ] ) given the lower metallicity of the stellar component compared to the gas component ( see section  3 ) .",
    "second , our mean metallicity of @xmath103 is large .",
