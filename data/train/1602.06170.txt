    "the muon spin rotation / relaxation / resonance ( @xmath0sr ) technique is a versatile local probe technique to investigate the physical properties of superconductors , magnetic systems , semiconductors and organic materials @xcite . because of its unique capabilities of a local probe technique it gives complementary information to other methods .",
    "the advantages of the technique include extreme sensitivity to small internal magnetic fields , the ability to detect magnetic fluctuations over a large range ( 10@xmath5/s ) and applications in a wide variety of sample environments .",
    "the muons are usually produced by an intensive , energetic ( 0.5 - 3 gev ) proton beam bombarding a graphite target , where the protons generate pions in nuclear reactions , which subsequently decay into muons and neutrinos .",
    "these muons have kinetic energies of the order of mev and above and penetrate deeply into a sample ( mm to cm ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath0sr experiments using these mev muons can only study bulk materials . to overcome these limitations and to extend @xmath0sr to the investigation of thin films , psi developed and operates the low energy muons beam facility ( lem ) where",
    "a cryogenic moderation method @xcite is used to generate fully polarized positive muons with tunable energies in the range of ev to several kev . up to",
    "now these characteristics have allowed the lem facility at psi to play a leading role in low energy muon experiments , extending the @xmath0sr technique to the investigation of nano - materials , layer interfaces , thin films and near - surface regions @xcite .",
    "the lem facility is located at the @xmath0e4 beam line , which is a hybrid - type large acceptance channel to generate an intense beam of so - called surface muons ( positive muons , @xmath6 , originating from pions decaying at rest close to the surface of the graphite target , with a kinetic energy of @xmath7 4 mev ) @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the surface muon beam at the exit of the @xmath0e4 beam line is about 4.6@xmath810@xmath9/s at a proton current of 2.2 ma .",
    "this represents at the moment the highest continuous surface muon flux in the world .",
    "about 40@xmath10 of the beam can be focussed onto the cryogenic moderator target . using a wide - band - gap van der waals solid gas ( s - n@xmath11 , s - ar ) a moderation efficiency ( @xmath12 ) of 10@xmath13 or 10@xmath14",
    "is achieved @xcite .",
    "the moderation of the muons from @xmath15 mev to @xmath16 ev is achieved within @xmath17  ps , such that their initial high polarization is conserved @xcite .",
    "the moderator consists of a 200 - 300 nm thick ar layer ( capped by a 10 nm thin n@xmath11 layer ) deposited on a thin ag foil ( @xmath7125 @xmath0 m ) @xcite which is held by a cryostat at a temperature below 20 k. the mean energy of the moderated muons is about 15 ev with a width of about 20 ev ( full width at half maximum , fwhm ) @xcite .",
    "these moderated muons can be re - accelerated by applying a high positive potential of up to 20 kv to the moderator @xcite .",
    "after acceleration they are transported by electro- and magneto - static beam elements to the sample position .",
    "the rate of moderated muons at the sample is up to 4@xmath810@xmath18/s . by tuning the high voltage of the moderator and the acceleration / deceleration high voltage at the sample , low - energy positive muons ( le-@xmath6 ) with tunable kinetic energies between 0.5 and 30 kev",
    "are obtained , corresponding to mean implantation depths ranging from a few nm to a few hundred nm in solid materials @xcite .    in transverse and longitudinal field",
    "@xmath0sr measurements an external magnetic field is applied to the sample .",
    "the direction of the external field can be parallel or perpendicular to the muon momentum . in lem experiments the sample",
    "is usually biased by application of an electric potential to adjust the final implantation energy .",
    "the corresponding electric field is superimposed onto the magnetic field . since both fields may influence the beam spot size , we investigated the effect using the musrsim simulation package @xcite which is based on geant4 @xcite . using these simulations",
    "we optimize the settings of the last electrostatic steering and focusing element for various magnetic fields - either perpendicular or parallel to the muon momentum - and varying implantation energies ( electric fields ) .",
    "these parameters allow to run the experiment with optimized beam transport onto the sample under different magnetic and electric field configurations .",
    "the results of this analysis are presented in section [ sec2 ] .",
    "the present le-@xmath6 beam size at the sample is about 14 mm ( fwhm ) in horizontal and vertical directions ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , and the corresponding root - mean - square values ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) are 6.0 mm @xcite .",
    "since typical thin - film samples are deposited on @xmath21 mm@xmath22 or @xmath23 mm@xmath22 substrates , the current beam size is larger than such samples .",
    "the beam size is significantly affected by the interaction of the muons with the carbon foil of the start ( or trigger ) detector , which provides the implantation time ( time zero ) of the muons and start the clock of the @xmath0sr data acquisition . the foil causes energy loss and broadening of the energy distribution of the muons , and increases the angular divergence of the beam ( transverse phase space ) @xcite . in order to understand and quantify the effect of the start detector on the beam size",
    ", we simulated the muon beam with and without the start detector .",
    "the corresponding @xmath19 , @xmath20 values are calculated and then compared to experimental measurements on the beam spot . an additional route for optimizing the beam spot size using collimators",

    "adjustable positive high voltages applied to the moderator and to a set of grids generate an accelerating electric field to reaccelerate the moderated muons from ev energy to higher energies , typically between 10 - 20  kev ( low energy muons ) . since the moderation efficiency is of the order of 10@xmath13 to 10@xmath14 most of the surface muons stop in the moderator target or leave the moderator with kev to hundreds of kev energies ( fast muons ) . an electrostatic mirror with an angle of 45@xmath27 with respect to the muon momentum",
    "is used to separate low energy muons from fast muons . after being focussed by einzel lens 1 ( l1 )",

    "after the deflection the spin polarization is perpendicular to the muon momentum . a spin rotator with crossed static magnetic and electric fields @xmath28 can be used to rotate the muon spin parallel or anti - parallel to its momentum @xcite .",

    "the le-@xmath6 spin direction ( @xmath24 ) can be changed to any angle from -90@xmath27 to + 90@xmath27 with respect to the initial muon spin direction by tuning the magnetic and electric fields in the spin rotator , such that the ratio e / b is chosen to match the velocity of the muons .",

    "it consists of a 10-nm - thin carbon foil transverse to the muon momentum , a microchannel plate ( mcp ) transverse to the carbon foil and a grid system used to direct secondary electrons , ejected by muons passing through the foil , to a mcp detector @xcite .",
    "the muons lose 0.5 - 1.0 kev energy in the foil , depending on energy , with an energy width of same order ( fwhm ) .",
    "multiple scattering in the foil leads to an increase of transverse phase space , which , in combination with the larger width of the energy distribution , causes an increase of the attainable beam spot size at the sample position .",
    "additionally , neutralization processes in the foil can lead to the formation of neutral muonium atoms ( a hydrogen - like bound state consisting of a positive muon and an electron ) .",

    "the beam spot shifts to the right side with meanx= 8.8 mm ( in experiment ) and 7.6 mm ( in simulation ) .",
    "the agreement between experiment and simulation is fairly good .",
    "the small deviations can be partially explained by the uncertainty in the applied potentials in the experiment , where it is known that the used high voltage power supplies have an absolute uncertainty between 10 and 30 v. the beam spot is deformed to a trapezoidal shape , which is different to the effect of the magnetic field which does nt cause a deformation .",
    "this deformation is caused by lens abberations in the ra due to proximity of the beam to the electrodes and the broken four fold symmetry of the electric field in case of a potential difference applied between two opposite segments . in the simulation ,",
    "the transmission from the moderator to the sample at 10 kv is about 55% , compared to about 70% at 15 kv . here",
    ", the transmission is defined as @xmath43 @xmath8100% , where @xmath44 is the number of muons in the sample plane , and @xmath29 is the initial number of muons at the moderator .",
    "the reduction of the transmission is due to i ) a longer time - of - flight at 10 kv , which increases the fraction of muons decaying in flight by about 5% at 10 kv compared to 15 kv , ii ) higher muonium ( mu ) formation probability in the carbon foil , by 10% , and iii ) larger beam divergence at 10 kv after the start detector . in the experiment",
    "we observe a corresponding drop of event rate when changing the beam transport settings from 15 kv to 10 kv .",
    ".simulated optimum values of ( ral - rar ) ( unit : kv ) to steer the beam spot to the center at different electric potentials at the sample between -10 kv and 10 kv , and different aew magnetic fields from 0 to 300 gauss , v@xmath41=15 kv .",
    "ral+rar=23.8 kv . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]    in the simulation we place a collimator with radius @xmath45  mm in front of the start detector to study the effect of beam collimation on the muon beam spot size . table [ table1 ] summarizes the rms values of the beam spot at the sample with and without collimation with the corresponding beam transmission @xmath46 .",
    "after collimation the beam area shrinks to about 30% of its initial value , while at the same time the transmission efficiency significantly drops to less than 10% for the present moderator size of 30@xmath830 mm@xmath22 . for a smaller moderator of 10@xmath810 mm@xmath22 area the beam spot at the sample without collimation at the start detector can be already clearly reduced , with about 2  mm smaller rms values .",
    "additional collimation in front of the start detector can further lower the beam spot size , which is now slightly smaller compared to the collimated beam for the 30@xmath830 mm@xmath22 moderator .",
    "the disadvantage of using collimators is the large reduction of beam transmission of up to about 90% , causing a corresponding reduction of low - energy muon rate . a better focusing of the surface muon beam onto the moderator target",
    "can - at least partially - counteract this loss , as is demonstrated by the simulation result with a 10@xmath810 mm@xmath22 moderator area .      to reduce the present lem beam spot size at the sample position two options have been investigated : the removal of the start detector , which is possible when using time integral measurements such as , for example , continuous wave radio frequency @xmath0sr ( rf-@xmath0sr ) , and the use of collimators .",
    "the muon beam spot size at the sample position can be significantly reduced to 3.5 - 4.0 mm rms values without the detector and for the present size of muon moderator of 30@xmath830 mm@xmath22 . to overcome the problem of generating a timing signal for le-@xmath0sr measurements , it is conceivable to use a 2@xmath47 moderator to re - moderate the low energy muons , as it is routinely done in slow positron beam setups @xcite .",
    "secondary electrons , created by the muons impinging on the moderator , could be directed onto a mcp detector to generate the required start signal for the @xmath0sr measurement instead of the start detector currently used .",
    "if successful , such a 2@xmath47 moderator could potentially be useful to further reduce the muon beam spot size to rms values @xmath48  mm .",
    "another possibility to significantly reduce the beam spot size at the sample to @xmath49 3.5  mm rms is the use of a smaller moderator target with a size of 10@xmath810  mm@xmath22 .",
    "additional collimation at the start detector can further lower the rms values to @xmath50  mm . in order to partially compensate for the corresponding loss in beam transmission we are considering an improved beam focus of the @xmath0e4 beamline by using a solenoid as the last focusing element , similar to the existing wsx61/wsx62 solenoids at the beginning of @xmath0e4 to replace the last quadrupole triplet qsm610 - 612 @xcite at the end of the beam line .",
    "the possibility of improving the extraction system after the lem moderator by using a soa lens will be also considered in the future .",
    "such a soa lens has been successfully used at the j - parc / muse facility @xcite and consists of several cylindrical electrodes with asymmetric high voltages .",
    "the advantage of this lens is that it produces a smaller beam cross section compared to the current system of planar grids .",
    "this can reduce the effect of lens abberations on the muon beam spot at the sample position .",
    "in this paper we presented a detailed geant4 investigation to optimize the experimental conditions for the present lem setup , where we studied the beam transport in magnetic and electric fields in the sample region . using these simulations we optimized the electric potential settings of the last segmented electrostatic element ( ra ) in the case of a vertical magnetic field at the sample position .",
    "this field is transverse to the muon momentum and requires steering by ra to center the beam . in the case of a magnetic field along the beam direction the increasing focusing power of the magnet has to be compensated by a reduction of the ra focusing power .",
    "these settings are tabulated in this paper and can be used in future le-@xmath0sr experiments as reference .    in order to extend the le-@xmath0sr technique to smaller sample sizes",
    "( @xmath49 10@xmath810 mm@xmath22 ) we studied the influence of the start detector and of collimators on the beam spot size .",
    "this investigation demonstrates the feasibility of achieving a beam spot with @xmath19 , @xmath51 mm .",
    "this requires a smaller muon moderator size ( @xmath49 30@xmath830 mm@xmath22 ) which can be realized by a better focusing of the @xmath0e4 beam onto the moderator by using a solenoid as the last element of the @xmath0e4 beam line",
    ". additionally , an optimized extraction at the moderator and a collimator at the start detector are necessary to achieve this goal , or the replacement of the existing start detector by a 2@xmath47 moderator .",
    "finally , we emphasize that geant4 simulations are very powerful to describe and optimize experimental setups , and to help pushing experimental capabilities to the limit .",

    "<S> the low - energy muon ( lem ) facility at psi provides slow fully polarized positive muons with tunable energies in the kev range to carry out muon spin rotation and relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) experiments with nanometer depth resolution on thin films , heterostructures and near - surface regions . </S>",
    "<S> the beam is focussed and transported to the sample by electrostatic lenses . </S>",
    "<S> a spin rotator upstream of the sample can be used to rotate the muon spin . </S>",
    "<S> an electric field along the muon momentum can also be applied to accelerate / decelerate the muons to different energies ( 0.5 - 30 kev ) . moreover , external magnetic fields at the sample are necessary for transverse and longitudinal field @xmath0sr experiments . </S>",
    "<S> all these fields affect the beam spot at the sample position , so that presently the lem beam has a beam spot at the sample position with root - mean - square ( rms ) values in @xmath1 and @xmath2 of about 6 mm . </S>",
    "<S> this practically limits the application of lem to sample sizes of @xmath3 1 @xmath4 . here , we present beam transport simulation results using geant4 , to optimize the beam transport onto the sample for various magnetic and electric fields applied at the sample , and to investigate several options to generate a smaller beam spot . </S>",
    "<S> we study in detail the effect of the muon start detector on the beam spot . </S>",
    "<S> we find that without the detector the rms values of the beam spot can be reduced to 3.5 - 4.0 mm . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that further reduction of the beam spot to 2.5 mm rms can be achieved by collimation before the start detector and at the source of the low - energy muon beam .    muon beam , muon spin rotation , low energy , beam size , geant4 </S>"
