    "@xmath0 molecules crystallize into a face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) structure with weak van der waals interactions . under extreme compression , the fcc @xmath0 crystal may transform into polycrystalline diamond , diamond - like materials , or graphitic forms .",
    "yamanaka et al .",
    "@xcite have succeeded in synthesizing two dimensional and three dimensional @xmath0 polymers at moderate pressure and temperature by forming covalent bonds between @xmath0 molecules via hybridization change of @xmath1 bond to @xmath2 bond .",
    "several polymorphs of 3-d @xmath0 have been theoretically proposed @xcite and studied by using electronic structure calculation , geometry optimization and phonon calculation . however , the experimentally observed structure is not fully consistent with any of theoretically predicted models",
    ". therefore molecular dynamics simulation of polymerization of @xmath0 is important to understand the crystal structure . in this paper",
    "we introduce a large scale tight binding molecular dynamics simulation of 3-d @xmath0 polymer formation with thousands of carbon atoms in the unit cell .",
    "such large scale quantum simulation was achieved by the combination of linear scaling tight - binding molecular dynamics ( tbmd ) @xcite and computational acceleration with graphic processing unit ( gpu ) @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of non - selfconsistent field tight binding method is written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the indices of atoms and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the indices of orbitals of the atom while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the creation and annihilation operators of electron .",
    "the one - body density matrix of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the eigenstates of ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and @xmath12 is the occupation number of the eigenstate @xmath11 .",
    "the density matrix contains all information of the system state .",
    "for example , the force on the @xmath4-th atom can be calculated as @xmath13 $ ] by using the density matrix and the force matrix .",
    "the computational cost is @xmath14 due to the diagonalization of hamiltonian where n is the total number of atoms .",
    "linear scaling of the computational cost with respect to @xmath15 is achieved by exploiting the locality of the density matrix , or solving the local electronic properties of the target atom by taking into account the atoms within the cutoff radius from the target atom only @xcite .",
    "then the computational cost becomes @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of atoms within the cutoff radius from the target atom .",
    "krylov basis of order @xmath18 with the seed vector @xmath19 for one dimensional uniform chain . ]",
    "the hilbert space of the hamiltonian of the atoms within the cutoff radius from the target atom is expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath17 is the number of the atoms in the cutoff sphere and @xmath6 is the index of the atomic orbital , which is hereafter omitted for simplicity .",
    "the krylov subspace of order @xmath18 with the _ seed vector _",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 , is generated by multiplying @xmath23 repeatedly on the seed vector @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath24 here we use the atomic orbital of the @xmath4-th atom as the seed vector , @xmath25 , to calculate the force on the @xmath4-th atom .",
    "this is quite different from the usual lanczos diagonalization methods where the random vector is used for the seed vector .",
    "the accuracy of the krylov subspace as an approximant of the original hilbert space increases rapidly as @xmath18 increases up to @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the degree of the minimal polynomial of @xmath23 with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "it was shown @xcite that krylov subspace of order @xmath29 can describe the system with sufficient accuracy .",
    "the efficiency of the krylov subspace can be understood from the physical point of view .",
    "since the tight binding hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) contains the hopping terms @xmath30 , multiplication of @xmath23 on @xmath28 makes the electron hop from the @xmath4-th atom to the neighbor atoms linked by the hopping terms .",
    "multiplying @xmath23 twice on @xmath28 makes the electron spread to the next nearest neighbors",
    ". therefore the krylov basis generated from the seed vector @xmath28 is localized at the target atom and then gradually spreads out to nearby atoms .",
    "let us examine this with the simplest example of one dimensional uniform chain whose hamiltonian matrix elements ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) are all zero except @xmath31 for all @xmath32 .",
    "then the krylov basis of order @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients , @xmath33 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the krylov basis in real space representation is shown .",
    "krylov subspace of small order ( @xmath34 ) can represent quantum states localized around the target atom accurately because it samples the wave function around the atom with larger weight .",

    "]    since krylov basis ( [ eq : krylov ] ) is not orthogonal , lanczos algorithm is often used to construct orthogonal basis set from it .",
    "lanczos algorithm transforms an hermitian matrix @xmath23 to a tridiagonal real symmetric matrix @xmath35 where the transform matrix @xmath36 consists of orthogonal basis @xmath37 called lanczos vector .",
    "the lanczos vector @xmath37 and the diagonal and off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) are calculated by the three term recursion formula : @xmath41 where @xmath42,@xmath43,@xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "once @xmath38 is obtained , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this small sized ( @xmath47 ) symmetric tridiagonal matrix are easily calculated by using common linear algebra libraries such as lapack .    in order to calculate all forces acting on the n atoms we have to repeat the above procedure for each atom . by rearranging the atoms into small groups consisting of @xmath26 atoms ( @xmath48 ) and calculating simultaneously the forces acting on the @xmath26 atoms , we can rewrite the three term recursion formula ( [ eq : lanczos ] ) in the matrix - matrix multiplication form ( level 3 blas form ) @xcite , which is efficiently calculated with gpu .",

    "two types of tight binding model parameters , xu s parameter@xcite and omata s parameter@xcite were used .",
    "both parameter sets have the same functional forms , but omata s parameter was constructed to reproduce the lda energetics of not only the @xmath1 graphene and @xmath2 diamond covalent bonds but also that of the @xmath1 interlayer interaction .",
    "the cutoff radius of xu s parameter is 2.6 a , while that of omata s parameter is 7.0 a so that it can include interaction between @xmath1 interlayers , which may be important for polymerization of @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "convergence was tested with respected to the number of atoms in the cutoff radius @xmath17 , the order of krylov subspace @xmath18 and size of supercell ( by using 8x8x8 supercell ) .",

    "simulation with omata s parameter successfully reproduced the polymerization of @xmath0 under high temperature and high pressure .",
    "however , the produced polymer was not perfect crystal .",

    "gpu can perform numerical calculation much faster than cpu in some types of computation such as matrix - matrix multiplication @xcite , fast fourier transformation ( fft ) @xcite , and the n - body problem @xcite .",
    "application of gpu computation is rapidly expanding to many fields of science including brain science , quantum science , astronomy and fluid dynamics @xcite . in this paper , we apply gpu computation to tight binding molecular dynamics . according to the amdal s law @xcite the speedup of a program using gpu is limited by the time needed for the cpu fraction of the program .",
    "the breakdown of computational time of the original cpu version of elses @xcite shows that the most time consuming part is the matrix - vector multiplication in the lanczos algorithm which is 99.92 % of the total computation time in our case .",
