    "josephson tunneling through uniformly magnetized ferromagnetic layers has been intensively studied in the past @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the josephson effect in the case when a ferromagnetic layer contains a vortex of the magnetization field .",
    "our interest to this problem is two - fold .",
    "firstly , micron - size disks of soft ferromagnetic materials naturally form a vortex ground state due to magnetic dipolar interactions .",
    "the variety of spatial dimensions of such disks @xcite ideally suites typical parameters of josephson junctions , with the disks thickness range being comparable to the values of the coherence - length of conventional superconductors .    secondly , recent macroscopic evidence of quantum diffusion of vortices in the array of submicron and micron - size magnetic disks raises question whether an individual vortex tunneling event can be observed by measuring the change in the tunneling current through the disk .",
    "curling of the magnetization in the plane of the disk leaves virtually no magnetic `` charges '' @xcite .",
    "still the topology of the vortex state generates a very weak uncompensated magnetic moment that sticks out of the plane of the disk .",
    "it is confined to the vortex core ( vc ) of diameter comparable to the material exchange length @xcite .",
    "recent experimental works reported evidence that the dynamics of the vc is affected by the presence of structural defects in the sample @xcite .",
    "this is indicative of the behavior similar to that of the elastic string in a random pinning potential @xcite , with the finite elasticity of the vortex provided by the exchange interaction@xcite .    in ref .",
    "the non - thermal magnetic relaxation under the action of an in - plane magnetic field below @xmath0 k has been reported .",
    "it has been attributed to the quantum diffusion of the vc in a random potential landscape towards the energy minimum . at low temperatures",
    "only the softest dynamical mode of the vortex can be activated , which corresponds to the gyrotropic motion of the vc .",
    "it consists of the circular motion of the vc @xcite that is equivalent to the uniform precession of the magnetic moment of the disk .",
    "the diffusion of the vc , while conceptually similar to the quantum diffusion of an elastic string @xcite , is mathematically different as it involves gyroscopic motion of the massless vortex @xcite .",
    "the problem of quantum tunneling of the vc out of the potential well created by the pinning potential has been recently studied in ref . .",
    "it was found , that the low - temperature quantum diffusion of the vc occurs via steps of a few interatomic distances .",
    "thermal diffusion at elevated temperatures may involve longer steps .",
    "theoretical picture of macroscopic relaxational dynamics of vortices in the array of micron - size permalloy disks agreed with experiment . in this paper",
    "we are asking the question whether the displacement of the vc by a few nanometers , or by a fraction of a nanometer , can be detected via measurement of the tunneling current through a josephson junction that is made of a magnetic disk in the vortex state",
    ". mathematical formulation of the problem is outlined in section [ sec - formulation ] .",
    "the phase of the superconducting order parameter is calculated in section [ sec - phase ] .",
    "josephson current is computed and plotted for a py disk in section [ sec - current ] .",
    "our results and suggestions for experiment are discussed in section [ sec - discussion ] .",
    "we consider a ferromagnetic josephson junction ( s / f / s ) , where the f - layer consists of a circularly polarized magnetic disk .",
    "this essentially non - uniform ground state is characterized by the curling of the magnetization in the plane of the disk and by the existence of the vortex that sticks out of the disk and carries small uncompensated magnetic moment , see fig .",
    "[ fig - geometry ] .",
    "notice that , in general , ferromagnetism weakens the superconductivity at the s / f boundary due to the proximity effect .",
    "it disappears if the ferromagnetic and superconducting surfaces are separated by a thin non - magnetic insulating layer , leaving only electromagnetic interaction of the josephson junction with the ferromagnet , which is the case studied here . under the practical condition that the lateral size of the junction is smaller than the radius of the disk , but much greater than the diameter of the nanoscale vc , the josephson current through the junction can be calculated rigorously .",
    "it is dominated by the configuration of the magnetization in the disk that depends on the position of the vc .",
    "the latter can be displaced by the external magnetic field parallel to the disk .",
    "the vc can also exhibit circular motion that corresponds to a collective gyroscopic mode of the disk .",
    "it can also move spontaneously via thermal or quantum diffusion in the presence of weak pinning .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find out whether the tiny movements of the vortex core can be detected by measuring the josephson current .",
    "the current - phase relation governing the dynamics of the josephson effect is given by the formula @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the maximum current density carried by the junction and @xmath3 is the phase difference between the two superconducting regions .",
    "we assume that both superconductors are prepared of the same material .",

    "we assume the rigidity of the vortex structure , which translates into the vc coordinates being independent of the @xmath20 variable .",
