    "sandpile models have played an important role in developing our understanding of self - organized criticality @xcite .",
    "one important notion is that of universality , the idea that quantities such as critical exponents and scaling functions are independent of microscopic details of the model .",
    "this has been studied in the context of individual models , but few have determined general conditions for models to belong to a particular universality class @xcite . in the following , we present details of the solution of a general directed one - dimensional sandpile model introduced in @xcite which is a generalisation of a model studied in @xcite .",
    "we use a central limit theorem for dependent random variables @xcite to determine the precise microscopic conditions for scaling of the moments of the avalanche - size probability .",
    "we also argue that there is an @xmath0-dependent crossover length @xmath1 , such that for systems with size @xmath2 branching process behaviour is observed .",
    "the avalanche size statistics are calculated by mapping the model to the problem of finding the area under a brownian curve with an absorbing boundary at the origin , that is , if @xmath3 is the trajectory of a brownian curve such that if @xmath4 for some @xmath5 then @xmath6 . in the large @xmath7 limit ,",
    "the avalanche size statistics are identical to those for the area under the brownian curve after a `` time '' equal to @xmath7 ; @xmath8 . this motivated us to calculate the moment generating function for this area , which is an interesting problem in its own right as there have been some recent interest in physical applications of the statistics of the area under brownian curves @xcite .",
    "the model we study is on a one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath7 where each lattice site , @xmath9 , may be in one of @xmath0 states .",
    "the state of site @xmath10 is denoted @xmath11 , which may take values @xmath12 and this is interpreted as the number of particles on site @xmath10 .    at the beginning of each time",
    "step a particle is added to site @xmath13 : @xmath14 .",
    "this site may topple a number of times , each toppling redistributing one particle from site @xmath13 to site @xmath15 : @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "when site @xmath15 receives a particle it may undergo topplings , redistributing particles to site @xmath18 , which in turn may topple , and so on until either a site does not topple , or site @xmath7 topples where the redistributed particles leave the system and the time step ends .",
    "the avalanche size , @xmath19 is the total number of topplings which occur during a single time step .",
    "the toppling rules are therefore defined through choosing the probability that a site with @xmath20 particles will topple so many times upon receiving a particle .",
    "the only restrictions on the topplings are : ( i ) @xmath11 must remain in the range @xmath21 $ ] . for instance , a site with @xmath22 may not topple more that three times when receiving a particle . moreover",
    ", a site with @xmath23 which receives a particle must topple at least once ..",
    "( ii ) when site @xmath10 topples it redistributes exactly one particle to site @xmath24 only . (",
    "iii ) the toppling rule is homogeneous and obeys a markov property in that the probability that site @xmath10 topples @xmath25 times depends only on @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , the requirement on the homogeneity can be relaxed and all the following is trivially extended to inhomogeneous toppling rules .",
    "each site will then have a different stationary state , but provided that the remaining constraints are obeyed , the scaling of the avalanches will remain unaltered . ( iv )",
    "there must be some probabilistic element to the toppling rules . to be precise ,",
    "there must exist at least one value of @xmath20 such that the number of topplings a site in this state undergoes is non - deterministic .",
    "this last restriction discounts purely deterministic toppling rules which lead to trivial dynamics .",
    "self - organised criticality ( soc ) is associated with a stationary state where the avalanche - size probability , @xmath26 , which is the probability of observing an avalanche of size @xmath19 in a system of size @xmath7 , obeys simple finite - size scaling , @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are non - universal constants , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are universal exponents and @xmath32 is a universal scaling function .",
    "it can be shown that if @xmath33 exists and is non - zero for @xmath34 , then @xmath35 hence , for @xmath36 , the scaling of the moments , @xmath37 with @xmath7 is universal and we can determine the universality class of a model by calculating the exponents @xmath31 and @xmath30 from the scaling of these moments .    to formulate the model",
    ", we use a markov matrix representation , which is an extension to the work in @xcite .",
    "the configuration of a system is @xmath38 for which we shall use the shorthand notation @xmath39 . in order to construct a markov matrix representation",
    ", we first consider a representation for the configuration of a single site , that is , a system of size @xmath40 .",
    "such a system can be in one of @xmath0 stable configurations , @xmath41 , and therefore we require an @xmath0-dimensional vector space to represent a probability measure over these configurations .",
    "we therefore construct @xmath0-dimensional left and right basis vectors , @xmath42 and @xmath43 where @xmath44{a}{b } \\aput{z \\text { times } } \\ncbar[nodesep=3pt , angle=90]{c}{d } \\aput{z \\text { times}}\\ ] ] such that @xmath45 . the configuration of a single site with @xmath20 particles is then represented by the basis vector @xmath46 , where the subscript @xmath13 reminds us that it is the configuration of 1 single site .",
    "the @xmath47-dimensional vectors representing configurations @xmath39 for systems with @xmath7 sites , @xmath48 , are constructed from these basis vectors @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the usual tensor product .",
    "a state vector @xmath51 is the weighted sum of basis vectors , @xmath52 where the weights @xmath53 are the probabilities that the system is in the configuration @xmath39 at time @xmath54 , that is @xmath55 .",
    "note that the normalisation condition requires @xmath56    the system is evolved by applying operators to the state vector @xmath51 .",
    "we define a toppling operator @xmath57 which adds a particle to site @xmath13 of a system of size @xmath7 and carries out all the topplings : @xmath58 making it clear that @xmath51 is a markov chain . using the @xmath59 representation",
    "the toppling operator is an @xmath60 matrix where @xmath61 is the probability that adding a particle to a system in the configuration @xmath48 results in the configuration @xmath62 after topplings .",
    "see appendix [ sec : precise ] for an explicit representation of @xmath57 for a system with @xmath63 .",
    "the steady state , @xmath64 is defined as the state which is invariant under application of the toppling operator @xmath57 .",
    "it is therefore the right eigenvector of @xmath57 with eigenvalue @xmath13 , @xmath65 the corresponding left eigenvector , @xmath66 satisfies @xmath67 since particle number is conserved in the bulk , the sum of each column in @xmath57 equals 1 .",
    "this leads to @xmath68 identifying the left eigenvector of the toppling operator @xmath69 .    in order to calculate the moment generating function for the avalanche - size probability it is convenient to define the operator @xmath70 such that @xmath71^m{\\vert 0 \\rangle}_l\\ ] ] is the avalanche size moment generating function over @xmath72 time steps and @xmath73 gives the @xmath74th moment of the avalanche - size probability in a system of size @xmath7",
    "the toppling operator is then @xmath75 to illustrate how to construct @xmath70 , consider the action of adding a particle to site @xmath76 .",
    "first , we look at the number of particles on that site , @xmath77 , and determine the number of times the site topples using the probabilities given by the toppling rule . hence",
    ", we require @xmath78 matrices of dimension @xmath0 , denoted @xmath79 , which will act on the first site and remove @xmath74 particles , multiplying the final state by the probability that this toppling took place .",
    "we then need to redistribute these particles to site @xmath80 , which we achieve by acting @xmath81 on the remaining @xmath82 sites .",
    "this works because adding to site @xmath15 of a system of size @xmath7 is equivalent to adding to site @xmath13 of a system of size @xmath82 ( note @xmath83 ) . finally , we multiply the remaining state by a factor @xmath84 , which marks the state as having toppled @xmath74 times , which gives moments of the avalanche size upon differentiation .",
    "this leads us to write the general toppling operator @xmath85^k{\\mathsf{s}}_k \\otimes { \\mathds{1}}^{\\otimes l-1}\\label{eq : genop},\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is an @xmath87 identity matrix and @xmath88 , @xmath89 times .",
    "the restrictions , ( i)-(iv ) , on the model give @xmath90_{ij } \\geq 0 $ ] for @xmath91 and equal to zero otherwise , that is , @xmath92 where the sum is over all @xmath20 which satisfy both @xmath93 and @xmath94 and @xmath95 is the probability that a site with @xmath20 particles topples @xmath74 times on receiving a particle .",
    "note that particle conservation requires @xmath96",
    "in this section we find the steady state , @xmath64 , which is the eigenvector of @xmath57 with eigenvalue 1 .",
    "consider the single site operator , @xmath97 we begin by finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues defined by @xmath98 where @xmath10 takes values from @xmath99 to @xmath100 . from the properties of the @xmath79 and the normalisation condition we find @xmath101 satisfies @xmath102 and",
    "so is the left eigenvector of @xmath103 with eigenvalue @xmath104 .",
    "the corresponding right eigenvector therefore satisfies @xmath105 which determines the precise form of the eigenvector . as the eigenvectors must be normalised , @xmath106 , we may write @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the probability that a site contains @xmath20 particles in the stationary state and @xmath109 .",
    "we can not , however , determine @xmath110 any more precisely without details of the @xmath79 and these will have to be calculated separately in each case .",
    "if the matrix @xmath111 is a regular markov matrix , that is , there exists an integer @xmath112 such that @xmath113_{ij } > 0 $ ] for all @xmath114 , then we have found the unique stationary state of the single site operator , @xmath115 in the following we shall always assume that @xmath111 is regular .",
    "the discussion of the necessary and sufficient conditions for a regular @xmath111 is non - trivial and we shall not discuss it in detail . we shall simply note that this requirement , along with restrictions ( i)-(iv ) , still leaves an abundance of choice for the toppling rules .",
    "for instance , it is easy to demonstrate that any tridiagonal matrix with positive definite elements is regular .",
    "hence , any toppling rule which always allows a site to topple zero times , once or twice on receiving a particle ( with the usual exceptions for @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) will automatically lead to an acceptable toppling rule .",
    "now that we have found the stationary state of the single site operator @xmath111 , we shall proceed to determine the stationary properties of the full operator @xmath57 by induction .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath118 as the @xmath10th eigenvector of @xmath70 such that @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the @xmath10th eigenvalue of @xmath70 .",
    "we now make the ansatz that these eigenvectors may be expressed @xmath121 operating on the left hand side with @xmath70 we find @xmath122 so , we find that @xmath123 is indeed an eigenvector of @xmath70 with eigenvalue @xmath124 . hence , by induction , and recalling that we have assumed @xmath57 is regular , the unique steady state is @xmath125 this is a product state , which means that it has no spatial correlations and indeed we find that avalanches in small systems are uncorrelated , leading to branching process behaviour .",
    "however , we will show that in larger systems temporal correlations develop which bring the avalanche behaviour away from the branching process to that characterised by the area under a brownian curve .",
    "in this section we define the toppling probability distribution and determine some of its properties which will be used in the next section . the toppling probability distribution , @xmath126 is defined as the probability that a system of size @xmath7 in the stationary state undergoes a total of @xmath19 topplings on receiving @xmath72 particles . in principle , it may be calculated from the moment generating function @xmath127^{m } { \\vert 0 \\rangle}_l\\right|_{x=0}\\ ] ] although this is rarely a simple task in practice .",
    "recall that we only consider toppling rules obeying the restrictions ( i)-(iv ) with a unique stationary state .",
    "first , we show that @xmath126 has a mean value @xmath128 which is what we would expect by considering conservation in the stationary state since every particle that enters the system must leave through the open boundary .",
    "we write down the equation for the first moment @xmath129^m { \\vert 0 \\rangle}_l \\right|_{x=1 } \\nonumber\\\\ & = m \\sum^n_{k=0 } { \\langle 0 \\vert}_1 k { \\mathsf{s}}_k { \\vert 0 \\rangle}_1 \\left ( 1 + q^{(1)}_{l-1,1}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] multiplying on the left by @xmath130 and differentiating , we find @xmath131 and so @xmath132 giving @xmath133 , with @xmath134 , which has the solution @xmath135 .",
    "next , we show that the avalanche probability may be factorized .",
    "we define @xmath136 as the joint probability that a system of size @xmath137 , which has received @xmath72 particles , undergoes @xmath19 topplings in the first site and @xmath54 in the remaining @xmath7 sites .",
    "@xmath138^m { \\vert 0 \\rangle}_{l+1}\\label{eq : joint}\\right|_{x_1=0\\\\x_l=0}\\ ] ] where @xmath139^k.\\ ] ] by expanding the bracket in and carrying out the differentiation with respect to @xmath140 , we find @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the kronecker delta , @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 .",
    "identifying the first scalar product as simply the probability that a site charged @xmath72 times topples @xmath19 times , @xmath146 , we have @xmath147 this is simply a statement about the fact that the directed nature means that sites @xmath148 do not have any influence on site @xmath76 .",
    "hence , if we consider @xmath25 , which is the number of times site @xmath10 topples during a particular avalanche , this result tells us that in the stationary state the sequence @xmath149 for a single avalanche forms a markov chain .",
    "this will become important later on when we come to map the avalanche size @xmath150 to the area under a random walker .",
    "we now derive three important results for the single site toppling probability distribution , @xmath151 , which we will use later to make the mapping of avalanches to the area under a brownian curve more rigorous .",
    "first , we show that the range of @xmath19 for which @xmath151 has support has an upper bound equal to @xmath152 .",
    "second , we show that @xmath151 has a stationary distribution for large @xmath72 , @xmath153 where the sum is over all @xmath93 satisfying @xmath154 . note that this is a function of @xmath155 only .",
    "finally , we consider the width of @xmath151 around its mean value , @xmath156 and show that @xmath157 for all @xmath72 .",
    "these results lead to a further result that the width is finite and non - zero for all @xmath72 , and approaches a constant for @xmath158 , which , again , will become important later when we map the problem to a random walker .",
    "the first of these results follows immediately from bulk conservation of particles : consider a site with @xmath20 particles , which is charged @xmath72 times .",
    "after @xmath19 topplings have taken place it will have @xmath159 particles . since both @xmath20 and @xmath160 must lie between @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    ", @xmath151 may only have non - zero values for @xmath161 . hence , @xmath162 for @xmath163 since such topplings are always impossible and @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "hence , @xmath166 is finite because the sum in has at most @xmath152 non - zero terms .",
    "next , we consider the probability distribution , @xmath167 , which is the probability that a site having @xmath20 particles which is charged @xmath72 times , is left with @xmath160 particles after @xmath168 topplings . in the stationary state , this is related to @xmath151 by @xmath169 since the values of @xmath20 a site passes through as it topples is a markov chain , we may write down the chapman - kolmogorov equation for @xmath167 , @xmath170 the probabilities @xmath171 are related to the single site operator , @xmath111 by @xmath172 and so we introduce the matrix @xmath173 , such that @xmath174 and becomes @xmath175 thus @xmath176 and , since @xmath111 is a regular markov matrix , there will be a unique stationary distribution @xmath177 satisfying @xmath178 the only non - trivial solution to is @xmath179 where we have noted that the stationary state , @xmath180 , is unique and conservation of probability requires @xmath181 this leads us to @xmath182 where we have noted that @xmath183 and the sum is over @xmath93 satisfying @xmath184 . finally , leads to @xmath185 where the sum is over all @xmath93 such that @xmath186 .",
    "this limit exists , is non - zero and is finite for @xmath165 .",
    "finally , we show that @xmath157 for all @xmath72 .",
    "consider again the probability distribution @xmath187^m$ ] and the equation for the width , @xmath188 for @xmath189 , for some @xmath190 , we require @xmath191 which follows from normalisation of @xmath173 and the fact that has no negative terms .",
    "this implies that , for all @xmath93 for which @xmath192 , @xmath193^{n m^ * } { \\vert e_z \\rangle}_1 = { \\vert e_z \\rangle}_1\\label{eq : cont}\\ ] ] where @xmath194 is an integer .",
    "however , since @xmath111 is regular , there exists an integer @xmath195 such that there is only one vector , @xmath180 , satisfying @xmath193^{n } { \\vert 0 \\rangle}_1 = { \\vert 0 \\rangle}_1\\ ] ] for any @xmath196 . if there are more than one values of @xmath20 for which @xmath192 this contradicts , and so @xmath166 is never zero . if , however , we have a single value , @xmath197 such that @xmath198 , then @xmath199 and does not lead to a contradiction .",
    "however , in this case the dynamics are trivial as the steady state has all sites with exactly @xmath197 particles and any particle added to the system will pass through immediately with exactly @xmath7 topplings .",
    "we now come to the main result we need in order to determine the avalanche statistics for the directed sandpile , which is that it may be mapped exactly onto a random walker on @xmath200 with an absorbing boundary at the origin . after adding",
    "a particle at the beginning of a time step , site @xmath76 will topple @xmath201 times with probability @xmath202 .",
    "these @xmath203 particles are redistributed to site @xmath80 , which will topple @xmath204 times with probability @xmath205 .",
    "the probability of site @xmath15 toppling @xmath206 times , independent of @xmath203 , which we denote @xmath207 , is @xmath208 which follows from . defining @xmath209 as the probability that site @xmath10 topples @xmath210 times independent of previous topplings , we have @xmath211 this is a random walker on the interval @xmath200 with the probability of hopping from @xmath212 to @xmath210 equal to @xmath213 .",
    "there is an absorbing boundary at @xmath214 since any non - toppling site stops the avalanche .",
    "if we denote the trajectory @xmath215 , @xmath216 , then the avalanche size is @xmath217 with @xmath218 , which is the area under the trajectory @xmath215 .",
    "note that the random walker described by has jumps which are correlated since the probability of hopping from @xmath212 to @xmath210 depends explicitly on @xmath212 and @xmath210 , and not simply the difference @xmath219 .",
    "this means we must be careful if we wish to use the results for the uncorrelated random walker , or its continuum limit .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author remarks that for martingales with a fixed maximum jump size exhibiting stationarity and ergodicity , there is a quantity , @xmath220 such that @xmath221\\ ! = \\ !",
    "! \\int^x_{-\\infty}\\!\\ !",
    "e^{-\\frac{1}{2}y^2}\\ \\rmd y\\label{eq : normal}\\ ] ] where @xmath222 is the variance of the @xmath0th step in the process .    to apply this result",
    ", we extend the random walker described by @xmath213 to the full space , @xmath223 for we may add in the effect of the boundaries later by use of mirror charges @xcite .",
    "as we have assumed the existence of a unique stationary state and have proven that @xmath224 and @xmath225 , all that is left to prove is ergodicity .",
    "this is equivalent to showing that the set of recurrent states of the random walker are irreducible , that is , the probability of reaching any recurrent state @xmath10 from any other recurrent state @xmath226 is non - zero .",
    "two states , @xmath10 and @xmath226 which have this property are said to intercommunicate , denoted @xmath227 .",
    "we consider the fact that @xmath111 is assumed to be regular , in which case there exists an @xmath89 such that @xmath228^m { \\vert e_{z ' } \\rangle } > 0 $ ] for all @xmath229 $ ] and @xmath230 .",
    "hence , all states @xmath231 intercommunicate since @xmath232 for all @xmath233 .",
    "we also note that @xmath234 and @xmath235 which follow respectively because the avalanche should always be able to finish in an infinite system and arbitrarily large avalanches can be initiated from a single added particle .",
    "when we consider states @xmath236 , we note that there can only be a finite number of these which do not intercommunicate with state 1 .",
    "since there is a unique stationary state which includes all states @xmath237 , these non - intercommunicating states must be transient and ergodicity follows .",
    "hence , we have now proven that for a toppling rule obeying the restrictions ( i)-(iv ) with a unique stationary state , ( i.e @xmath111 is regular ) , the distribution of the random walker on @xmath223 will approach the normal distribution given by .",
    "this means that , for long times , such a random walker with dependent jump sizes will have the statistics of ordinary diffusion with diffusion constant @xmath238 .",
    "hence , by adding mirror charges to remove paths that cross @xmath214 , we are able to calculate the large @xmath7 statistics of avalanches directly from the area under the brownian curve , which is our justification for calculating moments in the continuum limit in the next section .",
    "of course , we could have simply gone ahead and carried out the calculations in the continuum without the above analysis and demonstrated that they correctly modelled the numerics .",
    "however , had we done so we would not have had a precise idea of how trustworthy these calculations were and where we expect them to break down .",
    "having proven the correspondence between avalanches and a random walk of independent identically distributed step sizes , we proceed to calculate the moment generating function for the area under the brownian curve .",
    "the authors are aware of only one study which investigates the finite - size effects due to stopping the curve after some time , which corresponds to the finite size of the sandpile @xcite and since our analysis goes further than that in ref .",
    "@xcite , we present it here in some detail . the following calculation will be carried out using notation and language suitable for the random walker description of the problem .",
    "hence , the brownian curve will be described by a trajectory @xmath3 where @xmath210 is interpreted as `` space '' and @xmath54 is `` time '' with the diffusion constant @xmath239 having units @xmath240 .",
    "we do this because the path integral approach we are about to employ is more intuitive in this language . as existing on the entire interval @xmath200 and we measure the area up to the point @xmath7 , @xmath241 .",
    "hence , what is a boundary in the sandpile picture ( the open boundary at site @xmath242 ) is not considered a boundary in the brownian curve picture . ]",
    "the connection to the sandpile is made by noting that the number of topplings of site @xmath10 is equal to @xmath243 and the system size , @xmath7 , is equal to time at which we stop the curve @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : brownian ]    we begin with the generating function @xmath244 where @xmath245 is the probability that a random walker starting at @xmath210 has the area under its trajectory equal to @xmath246 after time @xmath7 .",
    "if we denote the trajectory of the walker @xmath3 , then the curves contributing to @xmath245 are all those which satisfy @xmath247 note that we have an absorbing boundary at @xmath214 , such that if @xmath4 for any @xmath54 then @xmath6 .",
    "hence , there are two contributions to @xmath245 : that due to trajectories which do not cross the absorbing boundary , @xmath248 and those which cross the absorbing boundary at some time @xmath249 , see figure  [ fig : brownian ]",
    ".    we shall treat these separately , writing @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the probability that a trajectory beginning at @xmath252 passes through @xmath253 with area @xmath246 and @xmath254 is the probability that a trajectory beginning at @xmath252 first touches the absorbing boundary at time @xmath54 , with area @xmath246 .    using standard path integral methods , we may write down @xmath255 \\rmd t\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath256 . taking the integral over @xmath246 we find that the first term on the right hand side of is @xmath257 \\rmd t\\right).\\ ] ] following the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , we note that this is simply the path integral for a brownian particle with a linear potential for @xmath258 and an infinite potential at @xmath214 .",
    "hence , we write this term as @xmath259 where @xmath260 .",
    "the resulting equation of motion , @xmath261 is easily solved using airy functions which can be used to form an orthonormal basis on @xmath200 @xcite , @xmath262 where @xmath263 are the zeros of the airy function , @xmath264 , @xmath265 etc .    in a similar way , for the second term on the right hand side of , we have @xmath266 since this is the current of diffusing particles with area under the curve equal to a , leaving the system at time @xmath54 .",
    "hence @xmath267    in order to proceed , we use the fact that the leading order @xmath7 dependence for each moment come from terms linear in @xmath210 . in ref .",

    "hence , all moments are proportional to @xmath210 to lowest order .",
    "the fact that the terms linear in @xmath210 will also be the highest order in @xmath7 follows from dimensional analysis .",
    "if we write down the expansion of a moment in powers of @xmath210 then each term must have the same dimension . by considering the dimensions of the available quantities ,",

    "taylor expanding @xmath280 and @xmath281 to first order about @xmath214 , @xmath282 note , however , that this approximation is not valid for the zeroth moment , @xmath283 since it is not proportional to @xmath210 .",

    "they calculate the quantity @xmath286 where the @xmath287 have been calculated in ref .",
    "we simply quote the first few values , @xmath288 apart from a few multiplicative prefactors , differs from only by the fact that the former uses @xmath289 .",
    "we therefore have to reinsert the diffusion constant , @xmath239 , which they assumed equal to @xmath290 , but this is easily done by considering the dimensions of the results .",
    "we note that @xmath284 is a dimensionless function , and so @xmath291 where @xmath292 is chosen such that @xmath284 is dimensionless .",
    "it is then easy to show that @xmath293 and @xmath294 where @xmath295    we may carry out an identical procedure for @xmath285 . the equivalent quantity in ref .",

    "@xcite , the first few values being @xmath298 following the same steps as above we find @xmath299 where @xmath300    hence we have @xmath301 where @xmath302 and the first few values are @xmath303 the first two values are in perfect agreement with those derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the authors are unaware of any previous calculations of @xmath304 for @xmath305 .",
    "thus we may immediately identify the exponents @xmath306 and @xmath307 and the amplitudes allow us to compute universal amplitude ratios , which we will use later to compare the numerics against theory .",
    "the convergence of @xmath209 to the normal distribution occurs only as @xmath308 , and hence the results above are only valid for @xmath309 . in using the brownian curve instead of the exact curve described by @xmath151",
    "we have taken a hydrodynamic limit and therefore thrown away any information about the statistics of the process for small @xmath7 .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to ask how we expect the results to differ in this regime .",
    "we propose the existence of an @xmath0 dependent crossover length , @xmath1 , such that the above scaling analysis is valid for @xmath310 .",
    "we argue that for smaller systems , @xmath311 , we expect to see scaling corresponding to the branching process .    consider adding a particle to the first site . if the probability that the site has @xmath20 particles , @xmath108 , has support for all @xmath312 $ ] , then for @xmath313 it is likely that @xmath314 . in this regime",
    "we may assume that the number of times the site topples due to this added particle , which we denote @xmath203 , is largely independent of @xmath20 .",
    "site @xmath15 therefore receives @xmath203 particles , each of which may cause it to topple @xmath315 times , @xmath316 with the total number of topplings of site 2 , @xmath317 . while @xmath20 remains far from @xmath99 and @xmath100 , the @xmath315 will be largely uncorrelated and by continuing this argument to more sites , we see that while @xmath25 remain small each site will topple nearly independently .",
    "however , as we continue through the system to higher @xmath10 the @xmath25 will begin to see large fluctuations and the avalanches will become correlated , assuming the scaling of the previous section .",
    "hence , we argue that for systems with @xmath311 , the avalanches will resemble those of the uncorrelated branching process with exponents @xmath318 and @xmath319 @xcite . for larger systems , @xmath310 ,",
    "temporal correlations emerge in the avalanches and @xmath306 , @xmath307 .",
    "the fact that the above argument relies on realisations where @xmath108 has support for a large range of @xmath20 indicates that the crossover length @xmath1 depends on the details of the toppling rules and as such can not be thought to have any `` universal '' qualities .",
    "indeed , we have not specified how the toppling rules in a realisation should be altered as @xmath0 is increased , and so it is impossible to say anything _ a priori _ about the behaviour of @xmath1 .",
    "we now support our claims with numerics by demonstrating that the correct scaling ( with crossovers - see previous section ) occurs for a particular realisation of this directed sandpile model . in order to study the scaling we choose a realisation such that it is clear how to generalise to higher @xmath0 .",
    "the only remaining difficulty is to find the correct variance to put into the equations when we come to compare with numerics . in all that follows ,",
    "we use @xmath320 as we find that it fits the data very well .",
    "we compare the scaling predicted above with numerics from a realisation with the following toppling rules : a site @xmath10 , @xmath321 which receives a particle will topple 1,2 or 3 times with probability @xmath322 or will not topple with probability @xmath323 .",
    "a site with @xmath324 will topple once with probability @xmath325 , a site with @xmath326 will topple once with probability @xmath327 and twice with probability @xmath322 and a site with @xmath23 will topple once with probability @xmath328 , and 2 or 3 times each with probability @xmath322 .",
    "a site with @xmath23 has to topple at least once in accordance with restriction ( i ) .",
    "we expect @xmath329 to scale with the system size @xmath330 where @xmath1 is a correlation length with some ( as yet unknown ) @xmath0-dependence .",
    "these results have been confirmed and are shown in figure  [ fig : numscaling ] .",
    "we also analyse the moment ratios defined by @xmath331 it is a straightforward calculation to show that , for an avalanche probability given by @xmath332 approach universal values for @xmath309 .",
    "these values are simply ratios of the amplitudes @xmath304 calculated in [ sec : moments ] , @xmath333 this agrees with the numerics , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : ratios ] for @xmath334 which appears to converge to a universal value of @xmath335 , in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction @xmath336 as well as numerics for a different realisation published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "this supports our claim that the @xmath309 limits of the @xmath332 are indeed universal .",
    "note also that @xmath1 has a notably different @xmath0 dependence in this model than in the one presented in @xcite . in this case , @xmath1 saturates to a constant value for large @xmath0 , meaning that for large @xmath0 the crossover occurs at the same value of @xmath7 .",

    "we have found the stationary state avalanche - size distribution for a general @xmath0-state directed sandpile model .",
    "the avalanches can be mapped onto a random walk of dependent random variables and , using an applicable central limit theorem , we have shown that under a broad set of conditions the moments scale with @xmath344 and @xmath345 .",
    "we also note that this value of @xmath30 agrees precisely with that obtained in @xcite , which calculates the probability distribution in the infinite system size limit .",
    "we have also calculated the moment generating function for the area under a random walker with an absorbing boundary , and found a relation for the moment amplitudes in terms of those already known for other brownian processes .",
    "in this section we calculate the steady state properties of an @xmath63 model , which is a generalisation of the model studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and compare predictions to numerical simulation . for @xmath63 , the most general model we can write down , which obeys the rules ( i)-(iv ) , is @xmath346 where @xmath347 is the probability that a site with @xmath348 does not topple on receiving a particle and @xmath349 is the probability that a site with @xmath350 topples twice on receiving a particle .",
    "hence , the single site toppling matrix is @xmath351 \\alpha &   x - \\beta x \\end{array}\\right).\\ ] ] we now proceed to calculate the steady state properties of this model , following the prescription given in [ sec : stationary ] .",
    "@xmath103 has eigenvalues @xmath352 , @xmath353 and eigenvectors @xmath354 hence , the eigenvector for the stationary state is @xmath355 valid for @xmath356 .    from these results it follows immediately @xmath357 and",
    "hence , from and using @xmath320 , @xmath358 in perfect agreement with numerics , see figure  [ fig : q_1_inf ] and figure  [ fig : manna ] .",
    "however , it should be noted that for @xmath359 and @xmath360 both approaching 1 the random walker it describes will spend more and more time on either only odd or only even sites .",
    "hence , it will take longer times ( larger system sizes ) for the statistics to reach the asymptotic values and so we expect very strong corrections to scaling for @xmath361 .",
