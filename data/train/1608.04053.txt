    "the presence of outliers in the velocity distribution of nearby stars has been known for many years .",
    "traditional ` runaway ' stars , with peculiar velocities typically greater than 40 km / s , constitute approximately @xmath1 of o- and b - type stars in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most runaway stars are ejected from the galactic plane shortly after their formation  @xcite .    in 2005 , a late b - type star was discovered in the outer halo having a heliocentric radial velocity of 853 @xmath2 12 km / s , which is significantly in excess of the galactic escape speed at that location  @xcite .",
    "such stars are called ` hypervelocity stars ' ( hvss ; for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite predicted the existence of hvss , suggesting that they can form via tidal disruption of a stellar binary by the central supermassive black hole of the milky way . in this scenario ,",
    "one of the binary stars is captured by the black hole , while the other is ejected , often at an extremely high velocity .",
    "to - date around 30 a / b / o - type unbound hvss have been found ( see * ? ? ?",
    "such stars can be used to probe star formation in the galactic center or constrain the potential of the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ejection rate of hvss has been calculated in various studies and has been used to investigate the properties of the progenitor systems .",
    "for example , the work of @xcite consider models that inject binaries from nuclear stellar disks adopting different stellar mass functions .",
    "they compare these to the observed s - stars in the galactic center and the b - type hvss in the galactic halo .",
    "the models that best match the set of observations have hvs ejection rates of @xmath3 to @xmath4 per year .",
    "similar studies modeling the properties of hvs have been carried out , for example @xcite or @xcite , and even the possibility of an lmc origin has been considered @xcite .",
    "most other mechanisms are not expected to produce such high - velocity stars , such as three - body interactions in the disk @xcite or super - nova kicks @xcite .",
    "recent works have made predictions for the ejection velocities from these scenarios , showing that velocities in excess of a few hundred @xmath5 are unlikely ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some studies argue otherwise , for example @xcite has claimed that asymmetric supernovae can produce runaway stars with velocities as high as 1,000 km / s , but this work cautions that more detailed population synthesis studies are required to make robust predictions for the rates of such ejecta .",
    "although all currently known hvss are young ( o-/b-/a - type ) stars , given the slope of the initial mass function one may expect many more older , low - mass hvss @xcite . in an early attempt to find these",
    ", @xcite used the non - detection of low - mass hvs in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) to place an upper limit on their formation rate , concluding that the ejection rate of unbound f / g - type stars is no more than 30 times larger than that of b - type ejecta .",
    "more - recently @xcite found 20 low mass g- and k - type hvss candidates from sdss by incorporating proper motions , something which @xcite avoided .",
    "half of these candidates exceeded their corresponding escape velocity with at least @xmath6 probability , but as none of the orbits were consistent with galactic center ejection their nature remained unclear .",
    "however , in the following year ,  @xcite reanalyzed the proper motions for 14 of these and found that they are all , in fact , bound to galaxy and the initial ( incorrect ) hvs classification was due to flawed proper motions .",
    "other low - mass hyper - velocity candidates have been claimed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but these may also be subject to spurious proper motions .",
    "having realized the importance of reliable proper motions , @xcite carried out a more cautious study of the runaway population of low - mass stars in sdss including more stringent proper motion cuts .",
    "they were able to detect a number of high - velocity runaway stars , but all of their hyper - velocity candidates were marginal detections ( with only one greater than 1@xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore , in effect , this result is in agreement with @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we continue the hunt for low - mass ejecta in sdss , focusing on high - quality proper motions and developing new techniques for optimizing future searches .",
    "note that the term hvs refers to stars that have been ejected from an interaction with the supermassive black hole _ and",
    "_ have velocities in excess of the escape speed at their present location .",
    "however , since we are interested in all stars that have been ejected by the hills mechanism , regardless of whether or not they are bound to the milky way , we follow @xcite and use the term hills star .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section [ sec : data ]",
    "we describe the sdss stripe 82 data used in our analysis . in section [",
    "sec : candidates ] we use sdss spectroscopy to identify 226 hills candidates , 29 of which are metal - rich . in section",
    "[ sec : palomar ] we add our own data from the palomar telescope and identify one hills candidate with [ fe / h ] @xmath8 -0.4 dex . in section",
    "[ sec : halo ] we discuss the possible sources of contamination , most importantly halo stars on radial orbits .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in order to identify hills stars reliably , one of the most important ingredients is a robust catalog of proper motions . because of this",
    ", we have chosen to focus our study on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) stripe 82 region .",
    "this is a narrow 2.5 deg wide stripe along the celestial equator in the south galactic cap , covering 250 deg@xmath9 around @xmath10 to @xmath11 deg , @xmath12 to @xmath13 deg .",
    "this stripe has been repeatedly imaged by sdss over 7 years allowing for studies of the variable sky and identification of many kinds of transient phenomena  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this dataset has also been used to construct high accuracy proper motion catalogs  @xcite .",
    "the  @xcite catalog is complete down to @xmath14 mag , making it one of the deepest large - area catalogs of its kind .",
    "the catalog was subsequently revised in @xcite , removing some low - level systematics and improving the uncertainties by using quasars as a reference frame .",
    "the resulting catalog has a precision of around 2 mas @xmath15 and negligible systematic errors ( @xmath80.1 - 0.2 mas @xmath15 ) .",
    "these catalogs have been exploited to hunt for white dwarfs  @xcite and wide binaries @xcite , and analyze the kinematic properties of galactic disk and halo stars  @xcite .",
    "we also need good photometry , so that we can estimate distances using the photometric relations from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our photometry mainly comes from the @xcite catalog , where the multiple stripe 82 epochs have been co - added to result in a high precision catalog ( e.g. @xmath16 photometry in @xmath17,@xmath18,@xmath19 and @xmath20 in @xmath21 ) .",
    "the @xmath21-band was sometimes problematic and there are cases where no @xmath21-band magnitudes are reported ; for these stars we have used the standard single - epoch sdss @xmath21-band photometry @xcite , although we have not included any stars with error greater than 0.2 mag .",
    "we first de - redden our photometry using the maps of @xcite . to ensure good quality photometry and astrometry we only use stars with magnitudes in the range 15 to 21 for all @xmath22-bands .",
    "second , we insist that the mean object type @xmath23 . this requires an object to be classified as a star in @xmath24 per cent of epochs . this is less than 100 per cent in order to retain objects that have been misclassified in a limited number of epochs due to problems with the sdss star - galaxy separation algorithm . in the @xcite catalog ,",
    "this occurs particularly in the final season , when observations were not exclusively taken in photometric conditions .",
    "third , we insist that the proper motion error is less than 4 @xmath25 @xmath15 to clean any objects with problematic astrometry .",
    "then we identify objects on the stellar locus using the following cuts @xcite : @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28 where the subscript ` 0 ' denotes a color that has been extinction corrected using the maps of  @xcite .",
    "table [ tab : number ] shows the number of stars passing these photometric cuts .",
    "a total of 249,901 stars pass these criteria , of which 36,869 use the sdss single - epoch @xmath21-band magnitude ( with the rest having @xmath21-band magnitudes from the @xcite co - add ) .      to complement these proper motions , we need spectroscopy to obtain radial velocities .",
    "we first obtain these from existing sdss spectroscopy , then later supplement this sample with our own observations ( see section [ sec : palomar ] ) .    the sdss project , and in particular its galactic extension segue @xcite ,",
    "have obtained spectra for hundreds of thousands of stars .",
    "stellar atmospheric parameters have been determined by the sloan stellar parameter pipeline data product  ( sspp ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and radial velocities found via elodie template matching .",
    "we have cross - matched our photometric sample with the sdss dr10 spectroscopic catalogue , and found that @xmath8 5.7% have suitable spectra  defined as those with sspp flag set to ` nnnn ' , which implies that there are no cautionary signs and the stellar parameters should be well determined @xcite . in this work we limit ourselves to spectra with @xmath29 and apply the following quality cuts : @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 < 0.5 ~dex$ ] .",

    "metallicity errors are around 0.1 dex for the shc candidates and 0.2 dex for the phc candidates . @xmath43 and @xmath44 denote the position and velocity at the last disk crossing ( see section [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "the efficiency of detecting hills candidates from a blind spectroscopy survey ( i.e. one with no preferential targeting of hills candidates ) is clearly limited .",
    "the sdss spectroscopic catalogue described above had an efficiency of only around 0.1% , with 10 - 20 hills candidates coming from a total of 13,170 stellar spectra in the stripe 82 region . in this section",
    "we describe an approach to optimize the search efficiency by utilizing proper motion information , then apply this technique to obtain candidates using spectroscopy from the palomar 200-inch telescope .",
    "we again base our target selection on the high - quality stripe 82 proper motions @xcite .",
    "targets are selected with sdss @xmath17-band magnitudes between @xmath45 , which balances our desire to observe many candidates with the need for sufficient @xmath46 to measure reliable line - of - sight velocities and metallicities .    as can be seen in the previous section ( e.g. the top - left panel of figure  [ fig : rb ] ) ,",
    "most of our hills candidates are metal - poor ( @xmath0\\lesssim-1.0 $ ] ) , but stars that have been ejected from the galactic center are expected to be relatively metal - rich .",
    "we thus use photometric metallicity relations to focus our search on metal - rich stars , utilizing the relations presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this method is calibrated for f- and g - type main - sequence stars , which we select by applying a color cut of @xmath47 to the stripe  82 catalog ; this is in addition to the cuts described in section [ sec : photometry ] and section [ sec : distance ] that are imposed to deliver stars on the stellar locus with good photometry . we choose to reject all stars with photometric metallicity @xmath0 < -0.6 $ ] , leaving a total of 21,052 stars that pass all of these cuts .",
    "distances are calculated using the approach described in section [ sec : distance ] . because the errors on individual photometric metallicities are larger than spectroscopic measurements , the errors in our derived distances are correspondingly larger at around 20% .",
    "we use these distances to estimate the current 3d positions and tangential velocities of all stars satisfying the above cuts , using the same approach as described in section [ sec : distance ] .    to select the best candidates for palomar observations , we simulate the orbits of all 21,052 stars for a range of radial velocities . in the top - right panel of figure",
    "[ fig : rb ] , it can be seen that most of the radial velocities for our hills candidates are negative .",
    "if we calculate the last disk crossing ( i.e. potential ejection position ) for each star as a function of the unknown radial velocity and focus on stars with minimum crossing position less than 0.5 kpc , we find that the minimum crossing position almost always occurs when the radial velocity lies in the range @xmath48 to @xmath49 @xmath50(only 1% of these stars have velocities outside this range ) .",
    "we use this velocity range in the following analysis .",
    "for each of our 21,052 stars , we calculate 400 monte carlo realizations of the orbit .",
    "we do this following the approach described in section [ sec : method ] , incorporating errors on all observable quantities ( helio - centric distance , proper motion , lsr and solar radius ) , but since we do not know the radial velocity we choose this uniformly within the range [ @xmath48 , @xmath49 ] @xmath50 .",
    "an example is illustrated in figure [ fig : vrad ] , where each point corresponds to the last disk crossing location for an individual monte carlo realization of the orbit .",
    "potential hills candidates can be identified using this crossing track , with good candidates being those for which the track intersects the galactic centre ( such as this example ) .",
    "we classify the strength of these candidates using two quantities derived from these monte carlo simulations : @xmath52 is the number of realizations for which the last disk crossing position lies within 1 kpc of the gc , and @xmath53 is number of realizations within 0.5 kpc of the gc .",
    "we define two sets of candidates , where the second is included to provide additional candidates at high right ascension , compensating for the fact that most candidates are at low right ascension and would not be observable for the whole night during our run .    * main targets : @xmath54 124 ( @xmath830% ) , @xmath55 58 ( @xmath815% ) , @xmath0 > -0.45 $ ] ; * high - ra targets : @xmath56 , @xmath54 99 ( @xmath8 25% ) , @xmath55 39 ( @xmath810% ) , @xmath0 > -0.6 $ ] .",
    "we select 60 main and 16 high - ra targets .",
    "two good targets were later rejected because they lie close to bright stars and would be difficult to observe .",
    "observations were carried out on the nights of 29 - 31 august 2014 using the double spectrograph ( dbsp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the hale 200-inch ( p200 ) , with time awarded from china s telescope access program .",
    "dbsp splits the light by use of a dichroic , allowing simultaneous observation of blue and red channel spectra . for our purposes",
    ", we used the d55 dichroic to place the transition at @xmath57   .",
    "all observations used a 128@xmath58-long slit with a width of 1.0  arcsec , with typical seeing on all three nights of @xmath59 . in the blue channel , we used the 600 line / mm grating ( 600/4000 ) centered at @xmath8  4500   , and the 600 line / mm grating ( 600/10000 ) centered at @xmath8  7200    in the red channel .",
    "this set up achieved resolutions of r@xmath601800 and r@xmath82400 at the positions of the hydrogen balmer ( h@xmath61 and h@xmath62 ) lines in the blue / red channels , respectively , with nearly continuous wavelength coverage from @xmath8 3000 - 8800   .",
    "each star was observed in two exposures , with typical exposure times ranging from @xmath63  seconds , depending on the target magnitude .",
    "dbsp separates spectra into two channels . with our setup ,",
    "the blue band covers @xmath64   , and the red band @xmath65   .",
    "to reduce the targets spectra , we use the standard tasks in iraf .",
    "we observed calibration lamps at the beginning of each night , including a henear lamp for the red channel and fear to fix the blue channel wavelength solution .",
    "however , after reducing the spectra , a check of sky lines with known wavelengths ( including those at 4046.6   , 4358.3   , 5461.0   , and 5577.3    in the blue band , and 7750.6   , 7821.5   , 7913.7   , 7993.3   , 8344.6   , 8382.4   , 8399.1   , 8430.1   , 8452.3   , and 8493.4    in the red channel ) shows offsets from their expected wavelengths .",
    "we thus correct each spectrum by this offset to place the sky lines at zero radial velocity .    for late - type stars ,",
    "we predominantly use the calcium ( ca ) h and k lines ( 3933.7    and 3968.5   ) to compute the average wavelength shift and obtain the best - fitting radial velocity in the blue band . in the red band ,",
    "we use the near - infrared ca triplet at 8498.0   , 8542.1   , and 8662.14    to compute the average wavelength shift and obtain the best - fitting radial velocity .",
    "the mean errors for all spectra are less than 20 km  @xmath66 in the blue band and less than 10 km  @xmath66 in the red .",
    "we choose to adopt the red - band velocities because of the higher resolution and the fact that there are more sky lines in this region . for the fainter stars we took two separate exposures in the red band and use the average of the two velocities as our final value .",
    "the two separate measurements show good agreement within the expected observational errors .    as discussed above , metallicities are important for determining the likelihood that a star was ejected from the gc .",
    "we estimate metallicities using a method based on empirical fits to the behavior of [ fe / h ] as a function of spectral line indices .",
    "in particular , we measure the equivalent widths of spectral lines using bandpass and pseudo - continuum definitions defined by @xcite for the low - resolution , lick / ids absorption line indices @xcite .",
    "the set of standards defining our empirical calibration include the standard system of @xcite , and the miles @xcite , the elodie.3.1 @xcite , and stelib @xcite libraries of spectra .",
    "we derive surface fits to the behavior of [ fe / h ] as a function of the fe5270 vs. h@xmath61 indices ( which are primarily sensitive to iron and hydrogen abundances ) . in practice , we average a number of fe indices from the spectra to derive an average iron index .",
    "the code recovers [ fe / h ] from high @xmath46 spectra of stars with known metallicities with accuracy of @xmath67  dex .",
    "this method has been used on low - resolution spectra of stars in the sagittarius stream @xcite , the botes  iii dwarf galaxy @xcite , and the anticenter stream @xcite , among others .",
    "we derive metallicities by running this algorithm on each of the spectra we obtained with dbsp and again adopt the values from the red part of the spectra . in general",
    "the agreement with the photometric metallicities is reasonable , with ( as expected ) a spread of around 0.4 dex .",
    "there are a couple of stars with spectroscopic values that are significantly more metal - poor than the photometric estimate , but as we describe below these are removed from our analysis .      given the radial velocity and metallicity from the spectrum , we first refine our distance estimate using the spectroscopic metallicity and then compute the crossing position and velocity as before ( see section [ sec : method ] ) .",
    "we check the crossing position for the 76 targets and find that 8 have average crossing radii less than 3 kpc , but 3 of these have metallicity less than -0.8 .",
    "we show the crossing positions for the remaining 5 metal - rich stars in figure [ fig : hale_po ] and list their properties in table [ tab : hills_metalrich ] .",
    "we label these candidates palomar hills candidates ( phc15 ) .",
    "the inset of this figure shows the crossing position of all 76 stars ; as expected most stars are on fairly circular orbits which last crossed the disk close to the solar radius .    for our best candidate , phc3 , the gc lies within 3@xmath7 of the last disk crossing , but the uncertainty on @xmath43 is large .",
    "for phc4 the 3@xmath7 likelihood regions is close to the gc , and both @xmath68 and @xmath44 are large .",
    "however , its orbit does not appear to intersect the gc and so , although this may be a hills candidate , it could only be so if there was a systematic error in one of the observed quantities ( e.g. the distance or proper motion ) .    to compare our proper motion selection algorithm to the blind sdss spectroscopic sample , we can see that we have one candidate with @xmath69 kpc , @xmath70 and @xmath0 > -0.6 $ ] . for our sdss sample",
    "we have 10 stars which pass these criteria .",
    "so the proper motion selected sample has an efficiency of around @xmath71 , while the sdss sample has an efficiency of @xmath72 .",
    "we are in the regime of small number statistics , but there is undoubtedly a significant improvement when using our proper motion selected sample .",
    "for all of our hills candidates , the current total spatial velocity is around 200 - 300 @xmath50 , which is consistent with typical halo stars .",
    "it is known that halo stars are on radial orbits and so it is natural to wonder whether they may constitute a significant source of contamination in our sample .",
    "we now address this issue , together with other possible contaminants at the end of the section .",
    "we can estimate the number of halo stars in our sample of 13,170 sdss stars ( cut 4 in table [ tab : number ] ) by counting the fraction that are counter - rotating .",
    "we find that 1,038 stars are counter - rotating and , assuming these are all halo stars and that the halo has no significant net rotation , this implies that the total number of halo stars will be twice this , i.e. around 16% .",
    "we then estimate the distribution of peri - centric radii ( @xmath73 ) for a mock sample of halo stars , using the halo velocity dispersion from @xcite .",
    "we take the positions of these mock halo stars from our observed sample of 13,170 stars , weighted by their halo probability as estimated from the density distribution of @xcite .",
    "we monte carlo this distribution to reduce statistical fluctuations and normalize so that the total number of stars matches the number predicted above .",
    "the resulting @xmath73 distribution is shown with the black line in figure [ fig : hhp ] .",
    "the shaded region shows the 1@xmath7 uncertainty in the mock halo distribution , assuming poissonian errors .",
    "the red line shows the observed distribution for our full sample of 226 hills candidates , where the fall - off for large @xmath73 is simply due to the fact that we only considered candidates with small values of @xmath74 .",
    "note that there is a clear excess in the observed distribution .",
    "if there were no hills stars in this sample , then the observed number should not exceed the predicted halo distribution , so this indicates that some of the candidates should be real .",
    "this can also be seen in the inset , which shows the cumulative distribution of @xmath73 ; the observed distribution ( red curve ) is consistently in excess of the expectations from our mock halo distribution at a level of around 5@xmath7 .",
    "although there is a significant excess , there could be deficiencies in our simplified halo model .",
    "firstly , if the halo exhibits net pro - grade rotation , then our estimate for the halo fraction will be underestimated . however",
    ", to bridge the gap between the observed and mock halo distributions would require an unfeasibly high level of rotation ; to increase our halo contribution by around 54% , which would bring it into agreement with the observed distribution , the halo would need to be rotating at around 35 @xmath50 .",
    "although some works have claimed such high levels of rotation may be possible ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the general belief is that rotation should not be this large ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "the second potential deficiency in the halo model is the level of anisotropy .",
    "however , our model adopts the dispersions of @xcite with spherical anisotropy parameter , @xmath75 which is at the radial end of the commonly assumed values ( measurements of @xmath61 typically range from around 0.4 to 0.6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , although we concede that the halo model parameters could be tweaked in order to decrease the discrepancy between the predicted distributions of @xmath76 , such an approach is unlikely to completely reconcile the discrepancy .",
    "if we accept that halo contamination may be present , one way to discriminate against this is to impose a metallicity cut , as we have discussed above . by restricting our sample to @xmath0 > -0.6 $ ] we remove a large amount of the halo contamination ( remember that the halo has a mean @xmath77 dex and dispersion @xmath78 dex ; @xcite ) and should retain any hills stars , which are expected to have high metallicities .",
    "this reduces our sample considerably .",
    "the total number of spectra falls from 13,170 to 4,893 and the number of hills candidates is only 10 . despite these small numbers",
    ", we can repeat the above exercise and predict the distribution of @xmath73 for the halo .",
    "there are only 48 counter - rotating stars in this metallicity range , indicating that the halo fraction is around 1.0% .",
    "the resulting prediction for the halo @xmath73 distribution is shown by the black line in figure [ fig : hhpmr ] and can be compared to the observed distribution in red . here",
    "the agreement is much better , indicating that these stars are more consistent with being from the metal - rich tail of the halo population .",
    "it is interesting to note the discrepancy between the two distributions in figure [ fig : hhp ] is not reflected in the metal - rich sample in figure [ fig : hhpmr ] .",
    "for example , the full sample of hills candidates has 77 stars with @xmath79 kpc , while our mock halo sample predicts only 50 , but for the metal - rich sample only 2 stars remain with @xmath79 kpc .",
    "this leaves 25 metal - poor stars unaccounted for and , as mentioned above , we do not believe this can be explained by deficiencies in our halo model .",
    "two other possible sources of contamination are bulge and thick - disk stars on radial orbits , but neither of these are expected to be significant . as pointed out by @xcite , the bulge dispersion of around 100 @xmath50is insufficient to produce a significant number of stars in the solar neighborhood (",
    "note that our sample are predicted to have left the bulge with velocities in excess of 450 @xmath50 ) .",
    "we estimate the thick disk contamination using the besancon model @xcite .",
    "this kinematics in this model are flawed in that it assumes a gaussian profile for the azimuthal velocities , whereas in reality the asymmetric drift induces a skew in the distribution ( see section 4.8.2 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to alleviate this issue , we replace besancon s azimuthal velocity distribution with the physically - motivated distribution of @xcite",
    "this model predicts negligible thick - disk contamination .",
    "although it is not inconceivable that one thick - disk star may be present in our two samples , the chances of significant contamination is small .",
    "for example , for the full sample of 13,170 stars , the probability that we have one thick - disk star on a highly radial orbit ( @xmath79 kpc ) is 27% , but the probability that we have three or more is less than 1% . for the metal - rich sample of 4,893 stars ,",
    "the probability of obtaining one radial thick - disk star is 8% , but less than 1% for two or more stars .    in conclusion , although our metal - rich hills candidates appear to be consistent with predictions for halo contamination ( albeit in some cases with unusually high metallicities ) , the metal - poor candidates are in conflict . while the nature of our hills candidates is unclear , it is unlikely that the metal - poor candidates can be explained away by halo , bulge or disk contamination .",
    "one could argue that they are the tail of high velocity runaway stars , ejected from mechanisms other than an interaction with the supermassive black hole .",
    "however , assuming these stars originated in the bulge , our ejection velocities are all in excess of 400 @xmath50 , which is hard to achieve by standard runaway mechanisms ( see section [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "the more metal - rich stars could potentially have been ejected from the disk , but this would require an ejection velocity vector orientated precisely against the disk s rotation in order to place the star on a highly radial orbit .",
    "this is possible , but the combination of ( a ) the requirement on the ejection vector , together with the fact that ( b ) such ejection speeds are towards the tail of the predicted distribution , mean that we do not expect this to be a major source of contamination .",
    "stars ejected from the galactic centre can be used to place important constraints on the milky way potential ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although many such stars have been found , most are too distant to obtain the detailed 6d phase - space information that is required to constrain the potential .",
    "we have therefore carried out a search for nearby ejected stars , focusing not only on unbound ejecta ( hypervelocity stars ) but also including bound ejecta ( which we dub hills stars ) . by integrating orbits back through time",
    "we have identified a number of candidates , with orbits consistent with galactic centre ejection .",
    "our analysis used data from sdss and , since the efficacy of such studies are often hampered by deficiencies in proper motion catalogs , we have chosen to utilize the reliable , high - precision stripe 82 proper motion catalogue @xcite .    from the 13,170 sdss stellar spectra in stripe 82 , we found 226 candidate hills stars .",
    "as was discussed in section [ sec : halo ] , this number is significantly in excess of what we would expect for halo stars on radial orbits and can not be explained by disk or bulge contamination .",
    "deficiencies in our halo model , due to incorrect assumptions about rotation or anisotropy , are unlikely to reconcile this discrepancy .",
    "one might speculate that an accretion event on a very radial orbit could cause this signal , but in conclusion the nature of the metal - poor candidates remains uncertain .",
    "since all known hypervelocity stars to - date are metal rich , we expect that our hills candidates should also be metal rich .",
    "however , there is a selection bias at play , since hypervelocity stars have been identified based on the fact that they are young ( and hence metal - rich ) stars that stand out amongst the old populations of the galactic halo .",
    "so it is possible that there may be low - mass metal - poor hypervelocity stars , but they have remained hidden from the existing search techniques . on the other hand , because the galactic bulge was enriched on such a short time - scale , the fraction of metal - poor stars in the bulge will be small , even at earlier times .",
    "this indicates that it would be surprising if we were to find a significant population of metal - poor hills stars .",
    "if we follow the assumption that hills stars should be metal - rich and restrict ourselves to such stars , we find 29 candidates with @xmath0 > -0.8 $ ] dex and 10 with @xmath0 > -0.6 $ ] dex .",
    "their metallicities are more consistent with what we expect for bulge ejecta , and so follow - up observations could be particularly interesting for these stars .",
    "it is worth noting that even if these are genuine hills stars , none of them are unbound and hence our result is in agreement with the non - detection from @xcite .",
    "we can carry out an order - of - magnitude estimate of the ejection rate for these candidates , following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see the first paragraph of section 3.2 ) . the survey volume of our 250 sq .",
    "wedge is around 3.2 kpc@xmath80 , assuming we probe distances of 0.5 to 5 kpc .",
    "however , from table [ tab : number ] we can see only 5.7% of stars have spectra , meaning that the effective volume is only 0.18 kpc@xmath80 .",
    "this is equivalent to a thin galacto - centric shell at 9 kpc of width @xmath81 kpc , which a 300 km / s hills star will spend @xmath82 myr traversing .",
    "therefore , if we assume we have between 1 to 10 hills stars in our sdss sample , this implies an ejection rate of @xmath83 myr@xmath84 . this is a very simplified calculation which neglects two important considerations : firstly , the survey volume we probe depends on the spectral type ; and secondly , since our sample are all bound",
    ", they may not be on their first passage through the solar radius . despite these limitations ,",
    "our estimate is comparable to existing predictions ; although classical b - type hvss are predicted to be ejected at a rate of 100 to 1000 myr@xmath84 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xcite calculate that the ejection rate of low - mass hills stars could be around 2 to 3 orders - of - magnitude greater than that of b - type stars .",
    "clearly larger samples with better statistics are required to fully address the question of ejection rates .    to address the issue of sample size ,",
    "we have developed a technique using proper - motions to optimize candidate selection ( section [ sec : palomar ] ) .",
    "we have tested this approach with our own radial velocities obtained from the palomar 200-inch telescope .",
    "this technique provides considerable improvement on the blind spectroscopic sample of sdss , being able to identify hills candidates with an efficiency around 20 times better than a blind search .",
    "we believe there is good potential for this approach in future . at 250 sq .",
    "deg . , stripe 82 covers less than 150th of the total sky .",
    "current surveys , such as pan - starrs @xcite , could immediately be used to repeat this exercise for significantly larger volumes .",
    "clearly the efficacy of this method depends on the uncertainties in the observed quantities , most notably the distances and proper motions .",
    "the thickness of the disk crossing track in figure [ fig : vrad ] ( see section [ sec : target_selection ] determines how reliable our method is ; if we knew all observed photometric properties to infinite precision , then this track would be a line and for bona - fide hills stars this would intersect the gc .",
    "the gaia mission will provide both distances and proper motions to exquisite precision for many millions of stars in the solar neighborhood , together with metallicities from the on - board spectro - photometryat @xmath85 mag .",
    "see http://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/science-performance and @xcite ] @xcite .",
    "such a dataset would dramatically improve the efficacy of our method ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vrad_gaia ] ) , producing a catalogue of high - probability candidates that could be followed up with moderate observing resources .",
    "the accurate distances and proper motions leads to much more precise knowledge of the ejected star s orbit , consequently providing greatly improved constraints on the galactic potential .",
    "we are now working on a follow - up paper to quantify how many hills stars would be required to place meaningful constraints on the potential and this will be reported in due course .",
