    "determining black hole mass is a fundamental step to understand the physics of the agn accretion disk ( e.g. bonning et al .",

    "active galaxies with broad emission lines provide a way of estimating black hole masses , assuming that the motion of the broad - line regions ( blr ) is dominated by the gravitational potential of the central source .",
    "thus , virial mass can be determined from the dynamics of the blr .",
    "the width of broad - emission lines are used in estimating the velocity scale , while the size ( r@xmath6 ) can be determined by measuring the time lag between the continuum flux changes ( presumably originating from an accretion flow ) and the corresponding flux changes in the broad - emission lines ( blanford & mckee 1982 ) .",
    "so far , reverberation masses have been determined for about three dozens of local seyfert galaxies and pg quasars , which are limited to redshift @xmath7 and optical luminosity l@xmath8 @xmath5 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath1 ( wandel et al .",
    "1999 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2000 , peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , while there are numerous agns with higher optical luminosity at @xmath10 .",
    "thus , it is crucial to increase the sample size , especially including higher luminosity and higher redshift agns , in order to validate the virial technique and understand its uncertainties .",
    "the size - luminosity relation  correlation between the measured time lag ( blr size ) and the continuum luminosity ( kaspi et al .",
    "2005 ; bentz et al .",
    "2006 )  provides a simple recipe for black hole mass estimation without reverberation mapping ( e.g. woo & urry 2002 ; vestergaard 2002 ; netzer & trakhtenbrot 2007 ; mcgill et al .",
    "2007 ) . therefore",
    ", measuring time lags for higher luminosity agns is also necessary to validate the size - luminosity relation and avoid extrapolations in estimating black hole masses for high luminosity and high redshift quasars ( e.g. mclure & dunlop 2004 ; vestergaard 2004 ) .",
    "depending on the redshift of the source , different broad emission lines can be used for reverberation studies . for local agns ,",
    "the best studied balmer lines , such as h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 , showed clear correspondence to the continuum changes ( e.g. peterson et al . 2004 ) . at @xmath13 , civ @xmath31549 and ly@xmath12 lines",

    "in the same study , however , the ly@xmath12 line showed no flux variability within 5% measurement error . in the local universe , time lag measurements with civ line have been reported for several seyfert galaxies ( see peterson et al .",

    "for example , clavel et al . (",
    "1991 ) reported that mgii line flux variability of ngc 5548 was much lower than flux changes in other broad lines and did not show clear correspondence to uv continuum flux changes . in the case of ngc 3516 ,",
    "the mgii line flux was almost constant in 1996 although other lines and the continuum showed large flux variations ( goad et al .",
    "in contrast , time - lag measurements were consistent between mgii and balmer lines for ngc 3783 ( reichert et al .",

    "clearly , flux variability of the mgii line has to be better constrained to test feasibility of reverberation mapping , especially for intermediate - to - high redshift quasars .",
    "we initiated a monitoring program to study mgii line variability and explore feasibility of reverberation mapping for bright quasars with the 1.5-m and 1.3-m telescopes at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) when these telescopes became available in service mode through the small and moderate aperture research telescope system ( smarts ) consortium in 2003 . in this paper",

    "photometric errors of individual stars were typically less than 1% .",
    "we chose three to five unsaturated stars brighter than each quasar for differential photometry .",
    "first , we calculated the magnitude difference between each comparison star and the target quasar .",
    "second , we normalized the magnitude difference to zero by subtracting the mean difference over all observed epochs .",
    "photometric errors of comparison stars were added in quadrature and then the photometric error of the target quasar was added on top of it , yielding total errors of @xmath41% for relative flux changes .    in figure 1",
    "we show relative b band flux variability .",
    "all five quasars showed significant flux variability in the b band .",
    "we find peak - to - peak variations in the range of 9%-24% and rms variations in the range of 3%-8% .",
    "we note that since the mgii line flux is also included in the b band photometry , b band flux variability can not be considered as the continuum ( such as 3000 ) variability unless the mgii line flux is constant ( see  3.4 for more details ) .",
    "nevertheless , the detected b band flux variations clearly demonstrate that our sample quasars have uv continuum variability .",
    "the flux uncertainty of the ground - based spectroscopy is typically larger than  10% due to the slit losses , sky transparency , and various seeing conditions . in reverberation",
    "mapping studies , non - varying narrow emission lines , such as [ ] originated from far extended low - density regions , are used as an internal flux calibrator . thus , flux variations of broad lines can be measured by normalizing each spectrum to a constant flux of the narrow line ( e.g. peterson et al .",
    "1998 ; woo et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the vicinity of the mgii line",
    ", there is no strong narrow line useful as an internal flux calibrator .",
    "the [ oii ] line at 3727  is far from mgii in spectral range and much weaker than mgii , not desirable as an internal calibrator .",
    "however , since the mgii line is much stronger than h@xmath11 , measuring its relative variation can be robustly done even without an internal flux calibrator as we demonstrate below .    instead of relying on the precision of flux calibration with spectrophotometric stars ,",
    "we normalize each single - epoch spectrum to match photometric measurements obtained at the same night . using b band response function ,",
    "we calculate synthetic magnitude from the observed spectrum and then normalize the spectrum by multiplying a scale factor in order to match the b band magnitude measured from photometry .",
    "the amount of flux calibration with a scale factor was typically 10%-20% of the original flux .",
    "we note that spectroscopy and photometry observations were not performed at the exact same time .",
    "thus , spectroscopic flux calibration is uncertain within the level of intra - night variations , which seem to be negligible for seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars based on the study by webb & malkan ( 2000 ) .",
    "due to the limited telescope time for photometry , we have not attempted to measure intra - night variations for individual objects , which can be tested in the future .",
    "using the flux calibrated spectra , we measure the flux and width of the mgii line in several steps as similarly done in other studies ( e.g. mcgill et al . 2007 ) .",
    "first , we fit the continuum under mgii with a straight line using the average flux around @xmath42700   and @xmath42900   with 40   wide windows .",
    "we linearly interpolate these two continuum points to define an underlying continuum .",
    "second , we measure the mgii line flux by integrating the flux using the continuum subtracted spectrum .",
    "we note that defining a true continuum under the mgii line is not straight forward because of the presence of broad feii emission blends ( small blue bump ) .",
    "hence , depending on how the underlying continuum is defined , the measured mgii line flux can vary .",
    "nevertheless , as far as we keep the same windows for determining the continuum , we can measure the relative changes in the mgii line flux between two different epochs .",
    "we did not subtract the broad feii emission , which could contribute small amount of flux to the wings of the mgii line .",
    "however , the relative flux changes in mgii will not be significantly affected by the contribution of the feii emission .",
    "the random error on the mgii line flux measurements is typically 3% level ( table 3 ) . by adding @xmath42% systematic error of the flux calibration to the random error",
    ", we take 5% as an upper limit to the total error of the mgii line flux measurements . a series of continuum - subtracted spectra for individual objects",
    "are presented in figures 2 - 6 , where variation of the mgii line flux can be qualitatively detected .    from each spectrum",
    "the monochromatic continuum flux was measured at 3000   by averaging the flux within 40   window .",
    "we note that the size of the window does not affect the continuum variability .",
    "typical errors on the continuum flux measurements were 2%-3% depending on the s / n of each spectrum ( see table 3 ) .      in figure 7 we present light curves of the mgii line flux ( left ) and the continuum flux at 3000   ( right ) .",
    "all five quasars showed continuum ( 3000 ) flux variability , with peak - to - peak variations of 17%-38% and rms variations of 6%-15% .",
    "continuum flux variation shows consistent pattern as b band flux variation in the case of cts536 , for which the mgii line flux has been almost constant during the monitoring period .",
    "however , for the other objects , the continuum flux variations are different from b band flux variations depending on the relative contribution of the mgii line flux .    in the case of mgii line flux",
    ", we detected 23%-50% peak - to - peak changes and 8%-17% rms variations for four objects .",
    "in contrast , one object , cts536 , did not show clear variation within the measurement error 5% .",
    "the mgii line flux variation of these four quasars is similar to that of local seyfert galaxies and high redshift quasars ( e.g. clavel et al .",
    "1991 ; trevese et al .",
    "2007 ) , implying that intermediate redshift quasars have similar characteristics of the mgii line flux variability , although the actual amplitude is highly variable depending on individual objects and the monitoring time base - line .      to measure the mgii line width",
    ", we fit the line profile with multi - gaussian models and determine the best fit model based on @xmath32 statistics . fitting the line profile is necessary for low quality spectra , for which fwhm can not be easily defined on the data .",
    "we measured fwhm on the best fit model as demonstrated in figures 2 - 6 ( red lines ) . in the case of cts667 ,",
    "feii contamination is present in the wings of the mgii line profile and our multi - gaussian model also fits the broad feii component .",
    "however , fwhm of the mgii line is not significantly affected by the shape of the wings .",
    "thus , we simply ignored the feii component although this will increase the uncertainties of mgii line width measurements , which is dominated by systematic errors from continuum subtraction and assumed to be @xmath45% .    in figure 8",
    "we compared measured fwhm with the continuum luminosity for each object .",
    "the rms variation of the mgii line width , ranging from 4% to 15% ( see table 3 ) , is similar to the rms variation of continuum flux , suggesting a photoionization origin of the mgii line .",
    "the reason why we do not clearly see a correlation between the line width and continuum luminosity , as expected from a photoionization model ( e.g. fwhm @xmath33 l@xmath34 ) , is probably due to the combined effects of measurement and systematic errors on the line width and relatively small flux variations of the continuum .",

    ", we measured variability of line width for the same quasars , which showed 4%-15% rms variations .",
    "these variability detections are consistent with a picture that the mgii line is variable as other broad lines , such as balmer lines or high ionization lines ( ly@xmath12 and civ ) .",
    "the mgii line of these intermediate redshift quasars probably originates in the same region as h@xmath11 , as shown in the cases of ngc 3783 and ngc 4151 , for which similar time - lags were measured from h@xmath11 and mgii lines ( reichert et al .",
    "1994 ; peterson et al . 2004",
    "; metzroth et al .",
    "it is possible that for some particular objects mgii line emitting region is more extended than h@xmath11 line emitting region , and hence mgii line variability may not be detected in short time scales .",
    "this scenario was suggested for ngc 3516 , which showed no mgii line flux variations ( goad et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , it is not clear whether ngc 3516 is an abnormal object with an extended mgii line region , or substantial fraction of quasars have a similarly extended mgii line region .",
    "monitoring flux variations of the mgii line together with the h@xmath11 line using a larger sample of agns is necessary to properly address these issues .",
    "although we did not attempt to do reverberation analysis due to the short time baseline with insufficient numbers of epochs , it is shown that the mgii line can be used for reverberation mapping for even luminous quasars at intermediate redshifts .",
    "compared to the local seyfert galaxies , a longer - term monitoring program is necessary for these objects due to the 1+z effect on the observed time scale as well as larger intrinsic reverberation time scales for more luminous quasars . the estimated time - lags for the sample quasars , based on the continuum luminosity at 3000   and the size - luminosity relation ( mclure & dunlop 2004 ) , range from 74 to 217 light - days .",
    "thus , a few year monitoring program with synchronous photometry and spectroscopy can reveal the reverberation time scales of the mgii line for the sample .",
    "small telescopes ( 1 - 3 m ) can be very useful tools for mgii line reverberation mapping since mgii is much stronger than h@xmath11 which has been generally used in reverberation mapping of local agns .",

    "<S> we monitored five high - luminosity quasars with @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 at @xmath2 to measure flux variability of the mgii @xmath32798 line and explore feasibility of reverberation mapping using mgii . </S>",
    "<S> over the two year monitoring program , imaging data were obtained with the a noble double - imaging camera on the 1.3-m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) , while spectroscopic data were obtained at the same night with the r - c spectrograph on the 1.5-m telescope at the ctio . by performing differential photometry using available field stars in each quasar image , </S>",
    "<S> we measured variability  10%-24% peak - to - peak changes and 3%-8% rms variations  in the b band , which includes flux changes in the rest - frame uv continuum ( @xmath42500 @xmath43600 ) as well as the mgii line . utilizing photometric measurements for spectroscopic flux calibration , we measured the mgii line flux and the continuum flux at 3000   from each single - epoch spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> four objects showed mgii line flux variability with 23%-50% peak - to - peak changes and 8%-17% rms variations over 1 - 1.5 year rest - frame time scales , while one object showed no mgii flux variability within the measurement error ( @xmath55% ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also detected 4%-15% rms variations of the mgii line width for all five objects . </S>",
    "<S> with synchronous observations for photometry and spectroscopy , we demonstrated the feasibility of the mgii line reverberation mapping for high - luminosity quasars at intermediate redshift . </S>"
