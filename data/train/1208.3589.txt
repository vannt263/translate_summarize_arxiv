    "the study of soliton and black hole solutions of einstein - yang - mills ( eym ) theory has a long history , sparked by the discovery of four dimensional , asymptotically flat , spherically symmetric , solitons @xcite and black holes @xcite when the gauge group is @xmath0 and the gauge field is purely magnetic .",

    "this is in contrast to the situation in asymptotically flat space - time , where the only eym solution where the gauge field has a non - zero electric part is the trivial embedded reissner - nordstrm solution @xcite .    in this paper",

    "we begin our analytic work in section  [ sec : local ] , by proving the local existence of solutions of the field equations near the origin , event horizon and infinity . in section  [ sec : global ] , we then prove the existence of global solutions of the field equations , using a non - linear perturbation argument based on the implicit function theorem rather than the usual `` shooting '' type methods which were employed in , for example , @xcite .",

    "we emphasize that our gauge field ansatz ( [ eq : gauge ] ) has both an electric part ( @xmath31 ) described by the single function @xmath29 and a magnetic part described by the single function @xmath30 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath29 as the `` electric gauge field function '' and @xmath30 as the `` magnetic gauge field function '' .",
    "substituting the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) and gauge field ( [ eq : gauge ] ) into the field equations ( [ eq : fieldeqns ] ) we obtain two einstein equations : @xmath32 and two yang - mills equations : @xmath33 in the above equations , a prime @xmath34 denotes @xmath35 .",

    "we start by assuming that the field variables have regular taylor series expansions about @xmath45 : @xmath52 to avoid a singularity either in the metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) or the field equations ( [ eq : eeqns][eq : ymeqns ] ) , it must be the case that @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we take @xmath55 without loss of generality since the field equations are invariant under the map @xmath37 .",
    "the constants @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are then determined in terms of @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 by the field equations and the series ( [ eq : origin1 ] ) become @xcite : @xmath62 subject to proving convergence , these series give us a three - parameter family of solutions near the origin , parameterized by @xmath63 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( plus the ads radius of curvature @xmath21 ) . in practise the value of @xmath59 is fixed by the requirement that @xmath64 as @xmath65 .      for a regular , non - extremal black hole event horizon at @xmath46",

    "series expansions of the field functions near the event horizon therefore take the form @xcite : @xmath69 where @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 are given by the field equations in terms of @xmath73 and @xmath74 as : @xmath75 and @xmath76 in this case we also anticipate the existence of a four - parameter family of solutions , with parameters @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( as well as the ads radius of curvature @xmath21 ) . as with the expansions near the origin ,",
    "the value of @xmath78 will be fixed by the requirement that @xmath64 as @xmath65 .",
    "as @xmath65 , we require our metric ( [ eq : metric ] ) to approach ads , so that @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 is a constant which corresponds to the mass of the soliton or black hole .",
    "assuming that the field variables have regular taylor series expansions near infinity , the second of the einstein equations ( [ eq : eeqns ] ) implies that @xmath82 as @xmath65 , so the series take the form @xmath83 the field equations place no restrictions on the constants @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 or @xmath81 , giving an expected five - parameter family of solutions ( which depend on the ads radius of curvature @xmath21 as well as the parameters above ) .",
    "the field equations ( [ eq : eeqns][eq : ymeqns ] ) have a few simple solutions :    1 .",
    "if we set @xmath88 then both @xmath89 and @xmath18 are constants , giving the schwarzschild - ads black hole solution . if , in addition , @xmath90 then pure ads is also a solution of the system .",
    "2 .   alternatively ,",
    "if we set @xmath91 then @xmath18 is still constant , but in this case @xmath92 giving the metric for a magnetically charged , abelian , reissner - nordstrm - ads black hole with charge @xmath93 .",
    "the abelian reissner - nordstrm - ads black hole with electric charge @xmath94 and magnetic charge equal to unity is also a solution , obtained by setting @xmath95 in which case @xmath96 and @xmath97 due to the coupling between the electric and magnetic gauge field functions in the yang - mills equations ( [ eq : ymeqns ] ) , abelian reissner - nordstrm - ads with non - zero electric charge but zero magnetic charge is not a solution of the system .",
    "4 .   finally , by setting @xmath98 , the field equations ( [ eq : eeqns][eq : ymeqns ] ) reduce to those for purely magnetic @xmath0 eym theory with a negative cosmological constant , whose solutions have already been studied in depth @xcite . in this case the second einstein equation for the metric function @xmath18 ( [ eq : eeqns ] ) decouples from the other equations .",
    "our focus in this paper is non - trivial solutions ( that is , solutions which do not appear in the list above ) , in a neighbourhood of either the pure ads solution or schwarzschild - ads solution .",
    "the dyonic field equations ( [ eq : eeqns][eq : ymeqns ] ) were solved numerically in @xcite , so here we briefly review those results .",
    "the field equations are solved by starting the integration close to either the origin ( for soliton solutions ) or event horizon ( for black hole solutions ) , using the relevant series ( ( [ eq : originfinal ] ) or ( [ eq : horizon ] ) respectively ) and integrating outwards to large @xmath19 , stopping either once the field variables have converged to their asymptotic values within a desired numerical tolerance or the solutions have become singular .",
    "to satisfy the boundary condition on @xmath18 at infinity , it is simplest to initially set either @xmath99 ( for soliton solutions ) or @xmath100 ( for black hole solutions ) and integrate the field equations .",
    "the value of @xmath18 as @xmath65 will then be @xmath101 which is in general not equal to unity . performing a scaling transformation ( [ eq : scaling ] ) with @xmath102 then gives a numerical solution for which the boundary conditions ( [ eq : infinity ] ) hold .",
    "with this approach , the parameters which can be varied are @xmath60 and @xmath61 for soliton solutions and @xmath77 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 for black hole solutions , as well as the ads radius of curvature @xmath21 .    for each value of @xmath21 and @xmath77 ( with @xmath103 for solitons ) , regular soliton and black hole solutions",
    "are found in continous regions of the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath104 or @xmath105 .",
    "the size of these regions increase as the ads radius @xmath21 decreases ( or , alternatively , as @xmath106 increases ) .",
    "some typical solutions are shown in figures  [ fig : one ] and [ fig : two ] .    ,",
    "@xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "both the electric gauge field function @xmath29 and the magnetic gauge field function @xmath30 are monotonically increasing and neither has any zeros for @xmath109 . , width=377 ]    , @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the electric gauge field function @xmath29 is monotonically increasing and the magnetic gauge field function @xmath30 is monotonically decreasing .",
    "neither gauge function has any zeros for @xmath113 . , width=377 ]    it is straightforward to show from the field equations ( [ eq : eeqns][eq : ymeqns ] ) that the electric gauge field function @xmath29 is monotonic , as are the metric functions @xmath89 and @xmath18 .",
    "this is not the case for the magnetic gauge field function @xmath30 , which typically has some zeros before approaching its asymptotic values .",
    "however , we find solutions in which @xmath30 has no zeros ( that is , is nodeless ) in a neighbourhood of the trivial pure ads ( for solitons ) or schwarzschild - ads ( for black holes ) solution .",
    "we observe that the size of the neighbourhood in which these nodeless solutions exist shrinks as the ads radius of curvature @xmath21 increases ( or @xmath114 decreases ) .",
    "similar behaviour is observed in the purely magnetic case @xcite .",
    "further details of the space of solutions can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section we prove the existence of local families of solutions of the field equations ( [ eq : eeqns][eq : ymeqns ] ) in neighbourhoods of the singular points @xmath45 ( origin ) , @xmath46 ( black hole event horizon ) and @xmath65 ( infinity ) .",

    "then follows in a straightforward way from the above theorem .",
    "one advantage of using theorem  [ thm : bfm ] is that the local solutions are analytic in the independent variable @xmath137 and also in the parameters @xmath138 .",
    "this is helpful when proving the global existence of solutions in section  [ sec : global ] . in each case",
    "the proof of local existence is very similar to that in @xcite , although the presence of the electric gauge field function @xmath29 complicates the analysis both in terms of the boundary conditions at the origin and event horizon , and also because , unlike the situation for purely magnetic configurations , here we must include the field equation for the metric function @xmath18 .",
