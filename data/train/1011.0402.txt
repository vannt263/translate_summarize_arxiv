    "understanding the interactions between ( charged ) particles is of great importance from a fundamental point of view to many natural , biological and industrial processes , which require control over the structure , stability and many other properties of a dispersion.@xcite in addition , due to their mesoscopic size , colloids provide an ideal experimental system for the investigation of questions related to many particle statistical mechanics in- and out - of - equilibrium and related to both structural and dynamical properties of condensed matter .",
    "it is experimentally possible to visualize and follow their positions in real time using microscopy techniques .",
    "the particles can then be tracked to reconstruct their individual trajectories . from these",
    ", the interaction forces can be calculated . according to the classical derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) theory ,",
    "the interaction between stable pairs of charged colloidal particles suspended in a dielectric medium is a sum of a repulsive electrostatic part and a generally shorter ranged attractive van der waals part.@xcite however , when dlvo theory is quantitatively confronted with experiments , some refinements are required.@xcite for example , the presence of adsorption of charged species at the colloidal surface and the complex charging mechanisms in nonaqueous media with low polarity,@xcite make it unclear as to what extent the electrostatic interactions can be described with a volume fraction and phase independent sum of pair potentials.@xcite measuring interparticle forces directly in these systems should help our understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "different experimental techniques have been advanced to directly or indirectly measure forces acting between charged objects from a few femto - newtons to sub - pico - newtons .",
    "total internal reflection microscopy ( tirm ) can measure the interaction forces between a microscopic sphere and a flat surface.@xcite the magnetic chaining technique ( mct ) has been used to directly probe the force - distance profile between magnetic colloidal particles.@xcite optical tweezers ( ot ) provide a powerful tool to optically manipulate colloidal systems and have been widely used in recent years to investigate colloidal interactions.@xcite it is also possible to measure interaction forces by inverting the pair correlation function @xmath1 in the case of weakly interacting systems using the boltzmann distribution , @xmath2$].@xcite    in the present paper , we use optical tweezers and a nipkow scanning disk confocal microscope to measure interaction forces between pairs of charged pmma colloidal particles suspended in a relatively low polar medium ( cyclohexyl chloride ( chc ) , @xmath3 ) at different ionic strengths , going from very low ( purified solvent ) to high ionic strength ( added salt ) .",
    "two particles are trapped , one is held in a stationary trap and the other particle is brought closer in small fixed steps . from the observed deviations of the particle positions inside the traps we calculate the interparticle forces .",
    "in our study , we used sterically stabilized and fluorescently labelled poly - methyl - methacrylate particles ( pmma)@xcite with diameter of @xmath4 @xmath5 m and size polydispersity of 3@xmath6 .",
    "the refractive index of chc is @xmath7 at @xmath8 nm , below that of the particles @xmath9 , which allows optical tweezer experiments . in this",
    "low - polar solvent , charge dissociation still occurs spontaneously,@xcite contrary to truly apolar media that require charge stabilizing surfactants.@xcite electrophoresis measurements in the dilute dispersion showed that the particles carried a positive charge of about @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 the elementary charge ) .",
    "we studied systems at a volume fraction @xmath12 , determined by particle tracking .",
    "four different samples were explored .",
    "the first one consisted of a pmma dispersion in purified chc using a method described elsewhere.@xcite in fact , the method offers a very convenient way to quickly reduce the conductivity ( from @xmath13 1000 ps / cm to less than 20 ps / cm ) and at the same time , alumina is often used as a desiccant to remove traces of water .",
    "additionally , the purified solvent is stored with added molecular sieves ( 4 ngstrm , acros organics ) that serve as an adsorbent . in the three other systems ,",
    "the ion concentrations were increased by exposing the initial purified sample under an uv lamp at different exposure times .",
    "it is known that uv exposure facilitates the partial degradation of cyclohexyl halides into ions,@xcite but it is difficult to quantify the salt concentration by conductivity measurements without knowing exactly which ions are generated . however , our measurements give an idea of how the different parameters in the same sample vary when exposed to uv light .",
    "the dried particles were initially mixed with the purified chc and allowed to equilibrate for 48 hours before measurements were performed .",
    "the sample was then gently remixed , placed in a glass capillary of @xmath14 mm inner dimensions ( vitrocom ) and sealed with norland 68 uv glue .",
    "while curing the glue , the sample was covered with aluminium foil to prevent solvent degradation .",
    "the measurement of particle interactions was performed using optical tweezers.@xcite we use a pair of optical tweezers formed by focusing a 1064 nm laser , using the same lens as used for imaging .",
    "we applied time - sharing using accousto - optic deflectors to generate two traps and to vary their positions.@xcite particle imaging was performed with a nipkow - disk scanning confocal microscope ( csu10 , yokogawa ) and recorded on a digital video camera ( evolution@xmath15 qei ) as in ref.@xcite . a @xmath16 1.4 na oil immersion objective ( leica plan apo )",
    "the particles were dyed with rhodamine and were excited with a millennia v diode - pumped laser beam ( @xmath17 = 532 nm ) .",
    "the trapped particles were located in the plane at about 14 @xmath5 m above the bottom of the capillary glass wall to avoid possible effects of the sample boundaries .",
    "one of the traps was brought closer to the other one in small steps of about 500 nm every 2 - 3 seconds . for every step ,",
    "1000 images of @xmath18 pixels were recorded to sample the brownian motion of the particles inside the traps .",
    "all images were processed to extract particle positions using home - made software based on methods similar to that described by crocker and grier.@xcite    m ) projected onto the @xmath19-axis ( chosen along the line connecting the two traps ) for different frames .",

    "consider two trapped particles .",
    "one ( at position @xmath20 ) is held in a stationary trap ( at the origin ) and the other particle ( situated at distance @xmath21 from the first particle ) is brought closer in small steps ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "the particle in the stationary trap will feel both the force @xmath22 exerted by its optical trap ( due to a well potential @xmath23 ) and a force @xmath24 due to the presence of the other particle .",
    "the additional force @xmath25 causes the equilibrium position of the particle in the stationary trap to shift by a small amount .",
    "as the mobile trap is moved closer to the stationary one , the strength of this force increases and the particle deviates further . the particle in the mobile trap is similarly pushed in the opposite direction . for sufficiently large forces ,",
    "brownian motion can cause one of the particles to escape its trap .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the positions of two particles as the mobile trap approaches , until one of the particles escapes . at large distances ,",
    "the pair interaction between the particles is negligible , but as the traps approach , each particle deviates from its well center due to the electrostatic repulsion . if the trap potential is known , the equilibrium position of the particle in the trap can be calculated from the boltzmann distribution .",
    "if we assume that the force @xmath26 exerted by the second particle does not vary significantly over the volume where the particle fluctuates ; @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the typical fluctuation displacement of the particle inside the trap , the expected position is given by : @xmath29 where the integrations are carried out over the volume of the trap .",
    "after ( numerically ) calculating the integral , this relation can be inverted to calculate the force on a particle from its measured position .",
    "for perfectly harmonic traps , @xmath30 .    to calculate the well potential we used the mie - debye representation given in ref.@xcite . in these calculations ,",
    "the parameters describing the laser trap configuration are the beam opening angle @xmath31 and @xmath32 the ratio of the objective focal length to the beam waist @xmath33 .",
    "we used @xmath34 , @xmath35 to model our laser spot with the @xmath16 1.4 na lens with appropriate overfilling.@xcite the spherical aberrations , due to the refractive index mismatch between the coverslip and the chc , depend on the distance from the geometric focus to the glass surface ( 14 @xmath5 m ) . to calculate the potential energy of the particle in the trap , the trapping force was integrated in the lateral direction at the trapping depth .",
    "the calculations show that for the parameters used in our experiments a distinct deviation from harmonic behavior , a relative increase in the stiffness at larger deviations , is expected.@xcite for the measured forces with the largest deviations , this effect can be up to 20% . by using the trapping potential from calculations we rest reassured that we do not underestimate these relatively larger forces .",
    "the trapping forces and potential assumed to scale with the power of the trap , such that the well potential is @xmath36 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath37 was measured from the standard deviation of the particle positions at large distances .",
    "from our measurements , we plot the particle deviation in the stationary well @xmath38 versus the particle separation @xmath39 ( for an example , see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "initially , the particle exhibits brownian motion inside the trap of a magnitude less than 0.1 @xmath5 m , i.e. @xmath40 of the particle diameter as demonstrated by the probability distribution of displacements plotted in the inset of the figure . from the standard deviation of this distribution",
    "we determine the proportionality factor @xmath37 , which sets the well depth .",
    "we then calculate average deviations at different interparticle distances by binning the data shown in fig.[fig2 ] , and convert these to forces using eq .",

    "the interaction force @xmath55 , initially soft and extremely long - ranged , becomes shorter - ranged for higher salt concentration , approaching that of hard - sphere systems .",
    "when performing the same measurements in the same sample with a different speed of approach , the resulting interactions do not differ significantly .",
    "this suggests that hydrodynamic effects due to the movement of the traps are negligible .",
    "since we do not follow the deviations in the @xmath56-direction but measure the projection of the particle separation onto the @xmath57 plane , we slightly underestimate the distance between the two particles .",
    "in addition , the assumption that the force is approximatly constant over the integration volume in eq .",
    "( [ position - force ] ) will lead to a small systematic errors in the measured forces .",
    "we performed monte carlo simulations to estimate these effects , simulating two particles in two optical traps with the interactions and well shape based on our experimental parameters .",

    "we independently estimated the debye screening lengths from the scaling law for the liquid - solid phase transition in yukawa systems,@xcite and measured the particle surface charges by means of electrophoresis .",

    "the data are also well fitted with the constant surface charge formula@xcite ( see fig.[forcewithtbac ] and table [ valuespmmachctbac ] for the different parameters ) . when the two samples are left vertically , sedimentation of particles induced crystallization .",
    "the samples were imaged with a tilted confocal microscope that allows to scan at all heights .",

    "using surface potentials from our force fits , this gives values for @xmath58 of about 2.3 and 2.8 respectively , in the same order of magnitude as from our force measurements .",
    "in addition , we obtained independent measurements of the ionic strength from the conductivity of the particle - free solvents .",

    "ii , we were neither able to fit our force measurement data assuming a constant surface potential nor a constant surface charge . therefore , we believe that the estimated value @xmath74 from eq.[couplingparameterxtal ] is more accurate in this case .",
    "electrophoretic measurements on the same dilute samples were conducted by driving the particles in a dc - electric field ( @xmath75 v / mm ) and measuring the electrophoretic mobility from particle tracking of the confocal images .",
    "using the values of the debye screening length @xmath50 from our force fits and the measured mobilities , the surface potentials were obtained using recent calculations for electrophoresis.@xcite this gives values of @xmath76 and 2.42 for samples i and ii respectively when using the screening lengths from the constant surface potential fits and , 4.38 and 2.43 for the case of constant surface charge .",
    "finally , to translate the surface potential into a particle charge @xmath77 , we used the empirical relationship proposed by loeb _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite the results of the electrophoresis measurements are slightly lower than the measured force parameters with a constant surface potential but slightly higher than the parameters obtained under the assumption of a constant surface charge .",
    "these results suggest the importance of charge regulation in the case of pmma dispersed in chc with added tbac.@xcite",
    "in summary , we have measured the interaction forces acting between charged pmma colloidal particles suspended in a relatively low dielectric medium directly from the deviations of particle positions inside an optical trap .",
    "the measured forces include all possible effects such as the influence of the surrounding particles .",
    "confocal microscopy can be used to track the particles at relatively high volume fractions @xmath13 15 @xmath6 where optical tweezers can still be operated . as a result , this method allows to measure particle interactions at higher volume fractions . additionally , our measurements quantified for the first time the effect of exposing a pmma / chc dispersion to uv light .",
    "when increasing the salt concentration by exposing the sample to uv light , the force measurements agree well with the classical dlvo theory assuming a constant surface potential . on the other hand , when adding tetrabutylammonium chloride ( tbac ) to vary the salt concentration , surface charge regulation seemed to play an important role .",
