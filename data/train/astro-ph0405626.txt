    "spiral galaxies are valuable laboratories for stellar evolution , stellar population , and star formation studies .",
    "detailed observations of the nearest galaxies are especially valuable , because they allow us to characterize the integrated properties of the stellar and interstellar components and their global relationships , while maintaining sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to study the properties of individual regions .",
    "infrared studies of spiral galaxies yield insight into both the evolved stellar content and star formation . because red giant stars have their peak emission in the near infrared , this wavelength range is most directly related to the underlying stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "emission from the hottest dust grains in star forming regions is detectable at wavelengths longer than about 3  , but grain emission only becomes a significant fraction of the overall emission at @xmath0  with the rise of the `` aromatic features '' @xcite .",
    "these features are usually attributed to vibrational modes of benzene - ring - based materials often called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah * ? ? ?",
    "this emission is dominated by transient heating from single - photon events , so there is no temperature information in the emission colors . _",

    "observations of spiral galaxies offer a tremendous advance over previous capabilities .",
    "the vast improvement in sensitivity gives the ability to map entire galaxies quickly , and the wavelength coverage allows direct tracing of the stellar and non - stellar components ( e.g. , @xcite , who discuss classification schemes based on these components ) .",
    "_ spitzer _  also provides sufficient angular resolution to map individual clouds and star forming regions in nearby galaxies ; the irac resolution of @xmath1 corresponds to a linear scale of @xmath240  pc at a distance of 4 mpc .",

    "irac observations of m81 were made on 2003 november 6 .",
    "each of 23 positions was observed with six 12-s frames : two repeats at each of three dither positions .",
    "positions near the center were observed last to minimize the effects of residual images .",
    "the visible disk of the galaxy was observed by both of irac s side - by - side fields of view , but the extended sky coverage is toward the northeast for 3.6 and 5.8  and toward the southwest for 4.5 and 8.0  .",
    "the data were processed with version 8.5.0 of the ssc online pipeline , using calibration files ( ` skyflats ' and ` skydarks ' ) derived from in - flight data .",
    "further processing was carried out in iraf : ` skydarks ' constructed by median - combining data well outside the galaxy were subtracted from 3.6 and 5.8@xmath8 m frames , a similarly - constructed ` skyflat ' was divided into the 8.0 @xmath8 m frames , and background levels of frames in all 4 bands were set to approximately zero by subtracting the median sky levels .",
    "the ssc `` background matching '' software was used to refine this procedure .",
    "image artifacts were corrected ( for cosmetic purposes ) with the iraf imedit task .",
    "mosaics combining all the data were made with the 2004 january 17 version of the ssc software mopex .",
    "mosaics for all four bands were made on the same sky grid using 086 pixels . because cosmic rays have different appearances in the four bands , different mopex settings were used to optimize cosmic ray rejection .",
    "figure  1 shows the four resulting images .",
    "inspection of figure  1 shows three distinct morphological components : a smooth distribution of starlight prominent in the 3.6 and 4.5  images , a clumpy distribution of dust emission seen at 5.8 and 8  , and a pointlike source at the nucleus seen at 4.5  and longer wavelengths .",
    "these components are discussed in turn below .",
    "quantitative analysis was based on fitting elliptical isophotes @xcite to all four images starting at a radius of 5@xmath9 .",
    "the isophotes as a function of semi - major axis were then fit to disk @xmath10 bulge models .",
    "similar models were also fit to circular aperture magnitudes , and the differences are taken to indicate the uncertainties .",
    "observed quantities have no extinction correction ; galactic extinction is negligible @xcite , and extinction internal to m81 is patchy and uncertain .",
    "for some of the narrow dust lanes , but extinction is much smaller over most of the disk .",

    "parameters are given in table  1 .",
    "the fitting also determines total magnitudes , which are 3.52 and 3.61 ( relative to vega @xmath13 ) at isophotal wavelengths of 3.54 and 4.50  @xcite .",
    "uncertainties are limited by the _ spitzer_calibration uncertainty of 10% .",

    "likewise , @xmath17 - [ 4.5 ] = -0.09 $ ] is very close to the expected @xmath18 for an m0  iii star ( m.  cohen , private communication ) , a spectral type representative of old stellar populations @xcite.-[4.5]$ ] color . ]    despite the overall good fit of the [ 3.6]@xmath19[4.5 ] color to late type stellar colors over most of the galaxy , there are regions that show redder colors .",
    "one region is the nucleus , discussed below .",
    "in addition , the bulge and disk show different overall colors : @xmath17 - [ 4.5 ] = -0.17 $ ] for the bulge and @xmath20 for the disk .",
    "all explanations for this color difference point to a disk generally younger than the bulge . a stellar population even slightly younger  dominated by k  stars instead of m  stars",
    " would have @xmath17 - [ 4.5]$ ] close to zero",
    ". a greater proportion of dusty interstellar matter in the disk may also cause reddening or , if the dust is heated , show up in emission , but dust is likely to be a small contributor to the color difference .",
    "spectrum found by @xcite , the dust contribution to the 3.6  emission would be 7% of the disk flux and 4% of the total flux .",
    "the @xcite dust model predicts a steeper slope , which would make the 3.6  dust contribution 13% of the disk emission at that wavelength .",
    "] there is also a small color gradient within the bulge .",
    "in contrast to the disk fit , which shows the same effective radius at 3.6 and 4.5  , the bulge fit shows a larger effective radius at 3.6 than at 4.5  .",
    "this means the inner regions of the bulge are redder than the outer regions and may indicate a younger stellar component near the nucleus .",
    "the arm / interarm surface brightness ratio is about 0.5  mag at 3.6  , comparable to values seen in other galaxies at 2.2  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this ratio should be a good measure of the mass density enhancement in the arms .",
    "nearly the same arm / interarm ratio is found from a blue image @xcite when the exact same areas of the galaxy are compared .",
    "this agrees with ratios found by @xcite .",
    "in fact , the 3.6  contrast is smaller inside a @xmath21 radius and larger outside , just like the contrast in blue light .",
    "however , the qualitative appearance in blue light differs from that at 3.6  ; the latter shows a smoother distribution , being less affected by star clusters or extinction patches .",
    "one of the most striking results from the irac images is the complex structure of the non - stellar emission , as traced in the 5.8 and 8  images .",
    "based on the morphology and colors , we assume that the 3.6  image is a direct measure of the stellar light . we have therefore subtracted the 3.6  image , scaled according to the expected color of an m0 star @xcite , from the 5.8 and 8  images to produce images of non - stellar emission .",
    "the 8  non - stellar image is shown in figure  3 .",
    "non - stellar flux densities are 2.3 and 5.9  jy at 5.8 and 8.0  respectively , 35% and 69% of the emission at these wavelengths .    qualitatively the non - stellar emission traces the same spiral structure as other gas tracers such as the h  i ( cf . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and optical dust lanes , as well as young stellar tracers including h@xmath22 , ultraviolet continuum emission @xcite , and the radio continuum ( kaufman et al .",
    "when the structure of the ir emission is examined in more detail , however , it is most strongly correlated with the optical dust lanes ( as might be expected ) .",
    "figure  3 shows large regions where there is strong emission at 8  but no detectable ultraviolet emission .",
    "detectable dust emission extends to the outer reaches of the star forming disk but not as far as the outer h  i spiral arms @xcite , showing a decline in the product of pah abundance and intensity of the stellar radiation .",
    "the non - stellar emission is both more spatially extended than the stellar distribution ( as shown in figure  2(d ) by the rising ratio of non - stellar to stellar emission beyond @xmath23 ) and much clumpier ( as shown in figure  1 ) .",
    "the arm / interarm ratio is 3 in the 8  image ( including starlight ) , similar to the ratio for ngc  6946 at 7 and 15   @xcite .",
    "the non - stellar image ( i.e. , with starlight subtracted ) is so clumpy that an `` arm surface brightness '' is virtually meaningless , but even modest clumps have surface brightnesses an order of magnitude greater than interarm regions , and the brightest clumps are more than 3 times brighter still .    the interstellar medium emission at the 5.8 and 8  is likely dominated by aromatic features usually attributed to pah , as demonstrated for instance by the iso - pht spectra of galaxies analyzed by @xcite .",
    "@xcite observed the central region of m81 ( @xmath24 beam ) with isophot - s and detected emission in the 7.7  pah feature but found a small feature / continuum ratio of @xmath250.115 .",
    "the low ratio compared to other galaxies may result from the large angular size of m81 relative to the more distant galaxies observed and thus the lesser disk contribution in the same fixed beam size .",
    "both starlight from the bulge and agn emission ( section  3.3 ) in the m81 nucleus will dilute the aromatic feature emission , which mostly comes from the disk ( figure  3 ) .",
    "aromatic feature emission measured with iso - cam in the 6.75  filter correlates well with h - alpha emission @xcite ( although the h@xmath22 to 15  correlation may be stronger@xcite ) .",
    "pah at 6.75  was therefore proposed as a reliable star formation estimator for typical galaxy disks .",
    "however , old , cool stars can also excite aromatic feature emission @xcite , and such emission is therefore not expected to be a perfect star formation indicator , any more than far infrared luminosity or any other indicator .    figure  3 shows that the non - stellar dust emission overall tracks the near ultraviolet emission ( nuv ) , but there are both regions with dust emission and no nuv and with nuv but no dust emission .",
    "pah without nuv can be explained by dust extinction ; one magnitude of visual extinction , which would heavily attenuate the nuv , corresponds to an undetectable 0.01  mag of differential extinction between 3.6 and 4.5  .",
    "seeing nuv light but not dust emission is harder to explain , but perhaps cavities cleared by supernova explosions are responsible .",
    "a signature of such cavities is clumpy h@xmath22 @xcite and 8  emission surrounding an area dark at these wavelengths but bright in nuv .",
    "this morphology can be explained by a supernova explosion having cleared gas and dust from a young star cluster , leaving behind and revealing the hot stars .",
    "the nucleus of m81 has been classified as a liner @xcite or seyfert  1 @xcite with an estimated black hole mass @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "like many galactic nuclei with inferred black holes , the m81 nucleus seems relatively inactive .",
    "nuclear emission varies by a factor of about two in visible light @xcite and near 10  @xcite on time scales estimated at about 25  years .",
    "the ground - based 10  data at @xmath5arcsec resolution suggest a pointlike nucleus .",
    "the new irac data suggest that the nuclear source has varied in the previous four years .",
    "irac flux densities in a @xmath27 square aperture ( _ including _ starlight ) are 109 , 75 , 65 , and 56  mjy at 3.6 to 8  respectively with uncertainties of about 10% . as used by grossan et  al . )",
    "would give smaller flux densities than with a large throw . ]",
    "the 8  flux density can be compared with the 1999 10  flux density of 159  mjy @xcite .",
    "the spectral shape of the nuclear emission between 8 and 10  is not known , although the iso spectrum in a @xmath28 beam shows a steep rise @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it seems hard to account for the difference in measured flux densities ( 159  mjy at 10  in 1999 ; 56  mjy at 8  in 2003 ) by spectral shape alone .",
    "if the difference is due to variability , it will strongly support the idea that we are seeing an agn component .    in order to examine the nuclear morphology , the bulge @xmath10 disk model fits",
    "were subtracted from the irac images at each wavelength .",
    "the results are shown in figure  3 .",
    "a residual pointlike source is quite evident at 4.5  and longer wavelengths and might be present at 3.6  as well , although the brightness of the stellar bulge at 3.6  and nearby negative values in the difference image make it hard to be sure .",
    "flux densities of the apparent pointlike source at the four irac wavelengths are 6 , 21 , 22 , and 39  mjy respectively , with the first being uncertain by more than a factor of two .",
    "@xcite found an unresolved source at the m81 nucleus on the basis of j - k color , and @xcite measured a flux density for the point source of 13  mjy at 1.6  .",
    "considering the uncertainties and possible variability , the spectral energy distribution from 1.6 to 8  might be consistent with either a power law ( @xmath29 ) or emission from dust having a temperature range of 4001000  k and emissivity that decreases with wavelength .",
    "the images also show a filament or bar of material leading from a ringlike structure at @xmath51  kpc ( @xmath30 ) to an inner disk and then to the agn .",
    "the prominence of the ring at 8  suggests that much of its emission is from dust and probably mostly aromatic features .",
    "these inner features are probably related to the structures seen in hst h@xmath22 images @xcite .",
    "1 .   irac images of m81 delineate three components by both morphology and energy distribution : evolved stars organized in bulge and disk components ; a clumpy , dusty interstellar medium with star forming regions ; and a pointlike active nucleus .",
    "2 .   the disk is redder than the bulge in the @xmath17-[4.5]$ ] color .",
    "this could be explained by reddening in the disk , by small amounts of dust emission in the disk , or by a younger stellar population in the disk .",
    "3 .   the arm / interarm surface brightness contrast at 3.6  is 0.5  magnitudes , in agreement with previous results in blue light . for normal stellar populations ,",
    "this value should represent the stellar mass density contrast .",
    "4 .   the nucleus of m81 shows an apparent point source .",
    "its flux density appears to have decreased by something like a factor of 3 in the past four years , and its sed can be represented by a non - thermal power law or by hot dust emission .",
    "star - forming regions are identified by their dust emission , probably mostly in the aromatic feature bands .",
    "overall the dust emission traces the spiral arms as seen in visible and near ultraviolet light , but there are many regions where dust emission is present and nuv is absent and some where the reverse is true .",
    "the ubiquity of dust emission implies that absorption affects both the distribution and amount of nuv light seen from star - forming regions .",
