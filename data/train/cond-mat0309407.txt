    "several materials studied in condensed - matter physics display unusual physical properties which are ascribed to strong electron correlations .",
    "@xcite in particular , these may give rise to rich phase diagrams with different competing types of short - range correlations and with different symmetry - broken phases .",
    "realistic many - body models of these materials contain an interaction - energy term of the same order of magnitude as the kinetic energy or even larger .",
    "this implies that it is quite generally inappropriate to treat these models by conventional weak - coupling perturbation theory or by static mean - field decouplings such as the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "a complementary approach consists in an exact treatment of the interacting part while the kinetic energy is accounted for perturbatively . for hubbard - type models",
    ", this corresponds to an expansion in powers of the hopping @xmath0 around the atomic limit , and leads - at the lowest order - to the so - called hubbard - i approximation .",
    "@xcite an expansion in @xmath0 can be organized in a systematic diagrammatic series .",
    "@xcite this approach , however , not only fails for @xmath0 of the order of the hubbard repulsion @xmath1 , but also for low temperatures , due to the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "an interesting extension of this strong - coupling expansion consists in dividing the lattice into clusters of sufficiently small size such that they can be treated exactly , followed by an expansion in powers of the hopping between the clusters .",
    "@xcite the expansion in the inter - cluster hopping can be formally carried out up to arbitrary order following the diagrammatic method of refs .  .",
    "however , going beyond the lowest order , is quite demanding numerically and has not been carried out so far for two - dimensional systems .",
    "for one - dimensional ( infinitely long ) chains , on the other hand , such an expansion could be accomplished in fact  to infinite order in powers of the inter - chain hopping . @xcite    the lowest order of the strong - coupling expansion in the inter - cluster hopping @xcite has been termed `` cluster - perturbation theory '' ( cpt ) .",
    "@xcite actually , the cpt can be considered as a systematic approach with respect to the cluster size , i.e.  it becomes exact in the limit @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number of sites within a cluster . from this point of view",
    "the cpt represents an attractive method which is simple conceptually but nevertheless includes short - range correlations on the scale of the cluster size .",
    "moreover , the cpt provides results for an infinitely extended system .",
    "consequently , the cpt green s function is defined for any wave vector @xmath4 in the brillouin zone , contrary to common `` direct '' cluster calculations for which only a few @xmath4 points are available , the necessary numerical effort is moderate : once the green s function of a cluster of a given size has been calculated via a numerical method , e.g.  the lanczos technique , the determination of the lattice green s function is numerically much less demanding as this requires the inversion of a certain number of matrices with a dimension given by @xmath3 only .",
    "cpt results for static quantities as well as for the single - particle spectral function have been shown to agree well with different exact analytical and numerical results .",
    "@xcite recently , a generalization of the method with different cluster shapes has successfully been used for an analysis of the stripe phase in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , there is also a serious disadvantage of the cpt at this level : namely , the method does not contain any self - consistent procedure which implies that symmetry - broken phases can not be studied ( the case of a degenerate ground state , as e.g.  for the hubbard - i approximation , represents an exception ) .",
    "this generates the motivation for the present paper .",
    "we will present an extension of the cpt which is based on the self - energy - functional approach ( sfa ) proposed recently .",
    "@xcite the sfa provides a general variational scheme to use dynamical information from an exactly solvable reference system ( an isolated cluster ) to approximate the physics of a system in the thermodynamic limit . using the sfa it is possible to construct a self - consistent or variational cluster - perturbation theory ( `` v - cpt '' ) which allows to study phases with spontaneously broken symmetry .",
    "the v - cpt applies to arbitrary hubbard - type lattice models with the restriction that the interaction be local .",
    "self - consistent cluster methods can also be constructed as generalizations of the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) @xcite as has been shown in recent years .",
    "@xcite similar as the cpt , the cellular dynamical mean - field theory ( c - dmft ) @xcite is based on a real - space formulation .",
    "the c - dmft performs a self - consistent mapping of the lattice problem onto an effective cluster model with @xmath5 correlated sites and reduces to the standard dmft for @xmath6 .",
    "cpt and c - dmft differ with respect to the concept of `` bath '' sites .",
    "the effective cluster model which is considered in the c - dmft contains an infinite number of additional uncorrelated ( `` bath '' ) sites attached to each of the @xmath3 original correlated sites in the cluster .",
    "the bath parameters are determined from a self - consistency condition .",
    "this construction ensures an optimal description of the local ( temporal ) degrees of freedom but complicates the method considerably . a numerically exact evaluation of cluster generalizations of the dmft",
    "could so far only be achieved by using quantum monte - carlo techniques .",
    "@xcite    recently , it has been pointed out @xcite within the context of the self - energy - functional approach ( sfa ) that both a ( variational ) cpt and the c - dmft can be considered as extreme limits ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) of a more general cluster method where reference is made to an effective cluster model with @xmath3 correlated sites and @xmath9 additional bath sites per correlated site .",
    "hence , the sfa formally unifies the different cluster approaches and thereby places our proposed method in a more general context .",
    "sfa - cluster calculations for the one - dimensional hubbard model @xcite strongly suggest that it is more efficient to use a cluster as large as possible and set @xmath7 ( no bath sites )  as compared to a smaller cluster and @xmath10 .",
    "this is contrary to the opposite limit of infinite dimensions : for @xmath11 the exact theory ( namely dmft ) is obtained for @xmath12 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is , therefore , particularly interesting to apply the v - cpt to the two - dimensional case and to compare with available numerically exact results .",
    "the low - temperature antiferromagnetic phase of the @xmath13 hubbard model at half - filling represents an optimal playground to study the strengths and limitations of the method .",
    "the reason is that both the effects of short - range correlations and long - range antiferromagnetic order manifest themselves in static thermodynamic quantities as well as in the single - particle excitation spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the variational generalization of the cpt is introduced in the following section . in sec .",
    "[ resu ] we present our results for the antiferromagnetic @xmath13 hubbard model .",

    "formally , the rest of the procedure remains unchanged .",
    "if the perturbative approach was exact , the results would not depend on @xmath40 at all . as a matter of fact , this can easily be seen in the non - interacting limit in which the cpt becomes exact . here",
    "the perturbation cancels out .    in the interacting case ,",
    "the result _ does _ depend on @xmath40 .",
    "however , this is not a shortcoming . on the contrary",
    ", this allows us to `` optimize '' the results of the cpt calculation .",
    "indeed , we may think of choosing @xmath40 such that the single - particle dynamics of the cluster problem is `` as close as possible '' to the exact dynamics of the lattice . in this way",
    ", one can hope that the perturbative correction is small and that the result of the perturbative calculation is accurate enough .",
    "the question is how to perform this optimization in practice .",
    "note that the answer to this question also solves our original problem as one may choose the perturbation @xmath40 to represent a `` ficticious '' symmetry - breaking field term ( a staggered magnetic field , for example ) since this has the form of a one - particle operator .    a straightforward idea to optimize @xmath40 ( or the strength @xmath41 of the symmetry - breaking field ) would be to express a thermodynamical potential ( the grand potential @xmath42 , for example ) in terms of the cpt green s function @xmath43 , which depends on @xmath40 in turn , and to minimize the function @xmath44 $ ] with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "however , the following serious problems arise : as the cpt green s function is approximate and as there are different ways to obtain the grand potential , the procedure is not unique .",
    "so there are several ways the potential can depend on the perturbation , and the results will depend on the respective choice .",
    "moreover , once the grand potential is given in terms of @xmath40 , there is no physical reason to minimize the grand potential as this would require a corresponding variational principle to be valid which is generally not the case .",

    "@xcite the problem is that the functional dependence @xmath48 $ ] or @xmath49 $ ] is not given explicitly but has to be constructed via an infinite sum of renormalized skeleton diagrams .",
    "this has impeded the use of the variational principles in their original form .",
    "here , the help comes from the self - energy - functional approach ( sfa ) @xcite proposed recently .",
    "the sfa provides a way to exactly evaluate the functional @xmath49 $ ]  even if the functional dependence is not explicit .",
    "this is achieved at the cost of a restriction of the domain of the functional , i.e.  the functional @xmath49 $ ] can be evaluated exactly on a certain subspace @xmath50 of trial self - energies .",
    "the idea is then to perform a search for the stationary point on the restricted space @xmath50 .",
    "the subspace @xmath50 consists of all @xmath51 which are exact self - energies of a reference system .",
    "clearly , the hamiltonian of the reference system @xmath27 must be exactly solvable so that one is able to compute the self - energy in practice .",
    "furthermore , general arguments @xcite require that @xmath27 must have the same interaction part as @xmath14 .",
    "the one - particle part of the reference system , however , is completely arbitrary and its parameters may be used to optimize the trial self - energy .",
    "note that these conditions are fulfilled for the case considered here .",
    "constructing the reference system by dividing the lattice into small clusters , the sfa concept just yields the desired variational cpt .    to verify this , it is sufficient to realize the following : equation ( [ gcpt ] ) which approximates the green s function @xmath24 of @xmath14 in terms of the green s function @xmath29 of the system of decoupled clusters @xmath27 and the inter - cluster hopping @xmath35 , can be cast into the form of a dyson equation , [ gcpteq ] g_q ( ) = ( g^(0)_q()^-1 - ( ) ) ^-1 . here",

    "this appears to be somewhat surprising since spatial correlations are neglected altogether in the dmft and also in the vmc calculation where local gutzwiller projectors are used , while the v - cpt does include the coupling to short - range correlations on the scale of the cluster size .",

    "recall that in two dimensions and for any finite temperature the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite shows that antiferromagnetic long - range order is destroyed due to spin waves with wave vector @xmath148 .",
    "hence , the overestimation of the staggered magnetization could be ascribed to the residual mean - field character of the v - cpt on a length scale exceeding the size of the cluster .",
    "this view is also substantiated by our results for the one - dimensional hubbard ladder which have been discussed above : to achieve a clear suppression of long - range order within the v - cpt , reference systems ( finite ladders ) as large as @xmath149 have been required ( fig .",
    "[ lad ] ) .",
    "this is an indication that in two dimensions a @xmath93 cluster might be to too small to include non - negligible effects of spin excitations on the order parameter .",
    "there is another important point which has to be taken into account in this context : for a cluster of a given size , an optimal v - cpt calculation should not only consider the ficticious staggered field @xmath41 but _ any _ one - particle term in the hamiltonian of the reference system as a variational parameter .",
    "it is in fact reasonable to assume that there is room for improvement : consider , for example , the hopping between nearest neighbors within the cluster as an additional variational parameter .",

    "we have performed corresponding calculations which show that a variational adjustment of the intra - cluster hopping at a considerably increased value is very likely in fact .",
    "however , a conclusive result has not yet been obtained .",
    "the reason is that the grand potential as a function of two variational parameters , the ficticious staggered field and the intra - cluster hopping , becomes rather flat in a wide region around the stationary point .",

    "@xcite      while the v - cpt must be considered as mean - field - like on a length scale exceeding the cluster size , it does account for short - range spatial correlations as the cluster problem is solved exactly .",

    "for both the high- and the low - energy excitations a strong spin polarization corresponding to @xmath141 is clearly visible .",
    "there is also some finite but low spectral weight within the insulating gap which , however , is an artifact of the finite lorentzian broadening ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the high - energy excitations in fig .  [ dos ] are interpreted as charge excitations ( hubbard `` bands '' ) . while these are due to local correlations , the low - energy features ( at @xmath154 ) result from ( short - range ) non - local correlations .",
    "the latter will be identified as being due to the coherent propagation of a quasiparticle , namely a `` spin bag '' .",
    "physically , this spin bag originates from the frustration induced by the motion of the additional bare hole ( electron ) in the antiferromagnetic spin background .",
    "the different spectral features can easily be identified : the high - energy features are due to the bare particle `` rattling around '' within the spin bag .",
    "this gives rise to an incoherent motion and broad energy `` bands '' , i.e.  the incoherent lower and upper hubbard `` bands '' with a width set by the energy scale of the bare band width @xmath155 .",
    "the low - energy features , on the other hand , correspond to the above - mentioned coherent motion of the spin bag resulting in a strongly renormalized quasi - particle band with a width essentially given by @xmath156 .",
    "note that these peaks are absent in a mean - field approach where off - site correlations are neglected altogether : a recent dmft study @xcite of antiferromagnetic order shows a rather featureless dos consisting of the two ( polarized ) hubbard bands only .",

    "some indications of the mentioned low - energy features can be found by using the non - crossing approximation ( nca ) to evaluate the dca .",

    "note that in both cases the spectral function is defined for any @xmath157 point in the brillouin zone , contrary to the `` direct '' cluster method ( qmc ) .    as already noted in the discussion of the local dos ,",
    "the v - cpt spectrum clearly consists of four spectral features , two high - energy `` bands '' which show strong damping effects ( incoherent hubbard bands ) and two narrow low - energy bands which represent the coherent dispersion of a quasi - particle ( spin bag ) .",
    "this four - band structure is also evident in the qmc result . comparing the energetic positions , dispersions , weights and widths of the four spectral features",
    ", one can state that the agreement with the qmc spectrum is almost perfect .",
    "roughly , the cpt and the v - cpt spectra appear to be similar but looking at finer structures it is obvious that the cpt predicts a spectral function which is quite different : first , and most important , there is no coherent low - energy band in the cpt spectrum .",
    "this shows up when comparing with the v - cpt around @xmath173 for @xmath174 ( or around @xmath175 for @xmath176 ) , for example : in agreement with the qmc result , the v - cpt predicts a dispersive low - energy band which extends continuously with spectral weight from @xmath173 to @xmath177 and which is clearly separated from the more incoherent feature at higher energies . on the other hand , in the cpt spectrum",
    "this is missing . in the @xmath178 direction",
    "the low - energy features turn out to be too broad and are discontinuously split into several branches in the cpt spectrum .",
    "the dispersion around @xmath177 is at variance with the qmc data .",
    "finally , at higher excitation energies , several weak and almost dispersionless bands can be found in the cpt spectrum while in the v - cpt there is a comparatively smooth incoherent background .",
    "we conclude that the variational procedure is crucial to achieve a qualitatively correct reproduction of the one - particle excitation spectrum and of the coherent quasi - particle band in particular .",
    "the _ physical _ reason is as follows . from previous qmc studies",
    "@xcite it is well known that the quasi - particle band is the dispersion of a spin bag , i.e.  an additional hole ( electron ) which is dressed by the local distortions of the spin order that are produced by the motion of the hole in the antiferromagnetic background .",
    "since the linear extension of the spin bag is about 3 - 4 sites only , this picture is already captured by an exact diagonalization of an isolated small cluster .",
    "however , the emergence of a coherent band requires more , namely a coherent motion of the spin bag on a larger length scale .",
    "this is captured in the qmc results for a large cluster of @xmath179 sites .",
    "of course , the perturbative treatment of the inter - cluster hopping within the cpt framework carries out a part of the job .",
    "this results in a string dispersion in the v - cpt spectrum with a bandwidth of about @xmath156 as can be read off from fig .",
    "also for the plain cpt the perturbative coupling of the clusters works into the right direction : although the spectrum more or less consists of a two - band structure , there is a tendency towards the formation of a gap within each of the two bands , i.e.a coherent band _ tends _ to split off . within the plain cpt , however , the motion of the dressed hole can not be completely coherent as there is no definite alignment of spins across the cluster boundary . upon reaching the cluster edge",
    ", the spin bag encounters a misaligned spin with 50% probability and is partly reflected back inside the cluster .",
    "this partial loss of coherence explains the several bands at higher energies in the cpt spectrum which are absent in the v - cpt .",
    "the variational generalization of the cpt cures this problem by ordering spins antiferromagnetically with help of the ficticious staggered field not only within but also across the cluster boundaries thereby allowing the coherent spin - bag propagation .",
    "correlated electron systems in two dimensions are in many cases characterized by strong local and non - local but still short - ranged correlations on the one hand and by long - range , e.g.  magnetic , order on the other . here , we have presented a variational extension of the cluster - perturbation theory which combines the exact diagonalization of isolated small clusters with a mean - field concept to build up an infinite lattice .",
    "conceptually , the method is based on the recently proposed self - energy - functional approach ( sfa ) which sets up a very general variational scheme to use dynamical information from an exactly solvable reference system @xmath27 ( the isolated cluster ) to approximate the physics of a system @xmath14 ( the @xmath13 hubbard model ) in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have applied the variational cpt ( v - cpt ) to the hubbard model at half - filling to study the antiferromagnetic phase at zero temperature .",
    "the diagonalization of hubbard clusters of finite size ( typically @xmath105 ) is performed using the standard lanczos algorithm . in comparison with results from variational monte - carlo and quantum monte - carlo studies ,",
    "the v - cpt predicts the ground - state energy and related static quantities with high accuracy . while long - range antiferromagnetic order is obtained for the @xmath13 model , the v - cpt yields a paramagnetic state for @xmath118",
    "this indicates that quantum spin fluctuations which inhibit an ordered phase in the @xmath118 case are included properly . for one - dimensional hubbard ladders",
    "the method in principle incorrectly predicts antiferromagnetic order ; however , the staggered magnetization is small and tends to vanish when increasing the number of rungs in the cluster ( up to @xmath180 ) .",
    "the finite but small @xmath98 for the ladder system should be considered as a mild reminiscence of a typical mean - field artifact which shows up because longer - range spin correlations exceeding the cluster dimensions are neglected .",
    "a similar effect is seen for the @xmath13 system : here the approximation is even stronger because the linear dimension of the cluster must be reduced even more to keep the number of cluster sites @xmath3 constant . for the @xmath13 system , antiferromagnetic order is expected physically and is also found by the calculations . however , longer - ranged spin correlations give rise to a considerable reduction of the order parameter which is not seen in the v - cpt for the maximum cluster size that has been considered .",
    "an important advantage of our method is that local and off - site short - range correlations within the ordered phase can be treated exactly .",
    "this shows up when looking at dynamical quantities , such as the spin - dependent local density of states or the spectral function @xmath181 .",
    "the spectral function as calculated from our self - consistent cluster approach agrees extremely well with the qmc ( maximum - entropy ) result for an @xmath179 hubbard lattice at finite but low temperatures .",
    "in particular , it is possible to reproduce the dispersions , widths and weights of the different spectral features .",
    "this is due to the fact that the typical four - band structure arises not only from local correlations which are captured in dynamical mean - field theory , for example , but also from a strong coupling to off - site spin correlations .",
    "the formation of a spin - bag quasi - particle as a hole which is dressed by the distortions of the antiferromagnetic spin structure that are introduced due its motion , is contained in the exact treatment of the cluster .",
    "in addition , the mean - field coupling of the individual clusters mediates the information on the spin order across the cluster boundaries and thereby gives a qualitatively correct description of the coherent propagation of the quasiparticle .",
    "this is essential to reproduce the low - energy quasi - particle band in the spectrum .",
    "there are different interesting routes to be explored in the future : a straightforward but technically ambitious idea is to employ a quantum monte - carlo technique within the self - energy - functional framework .",
    "this would offer the possibility to use a decomposition of the lattice into larger clusters which is expected to be important for a reliable estimate of the order parameter for example .",
    "another straightforward extension of the method concerns the number of variational parameters . for our present purposes the consideration of a single parameter ,",
    "the ficticious staggered field @xmath41 , has been sufficient .",
    "it is obvious , however , that the results should improve when treating _ any _ one - particle parameter within the cluster as a variational parameter .",
    "this might also affect the magnetic properties because of the direct link between hopping parameters and the effective exchange interactions . here",
    "an improved numerical evaluation of the theory is required which is free from the use of broadening parameters , see refs .  .",
    "an important conceptual problem of the method consists in the fact that a suitable reference system can be found in case of local ( on - site ) interaction terms only .",
    "the reason for this restriction is that for models including e.g.  a nearest - neighbor coulomb interaction , the partitioning of the infinite lattice into decoupled clusters is impossible without cutting the inter - cluster interaction .",
    "general arguments , @xcite however , require that the interaction part of the hamiltonian of the reference system be unchanged . consequently , there is a need for an extension of the theory to models with non - local interaction terms .",
    "this will be the subject of a forthcoming paper .",
    "@xcite    the v - cpt compares with the recent cluster extensions of the dmft : @xcite characteristic to both approaches is the combination of a numerically exact treatment of an isolated cluster with an approximate mean - field treatment of the coupling between different clusters .",
    "the v - cpt is , however , much easier to implement numerically and in principle allows for a diagonalization of larger clusters which facilitates a proper finite - size scaling .",
    "the reason for this conceptual simplicity is the fact that there is no coupling to bath degrees of freedom which is inherent to the cluster extensions of the dmft .",
    "recent results @xcite for the @xmath118 hubbard model have shown that it is in fact more efficient to consider larger clusters instead of a coupling to bath sites .",
    "for the two - dimensional case , however , there is no answer to this question at present , and it is unclear whether or not bath degrees of freedom efficiently speed up the convergence to the exact solution with increasing cluster size . note that a hopping to uncorrelated bath sites is nothing but a modified one - particle part of the hamiltonian of the reference system and thus completely in line with the general concept of the self - energy - functional approach .",
    "in particular , it can be very interesting to consider an extension of the v - cpt with a coupling to a _",
    "few _ bath sites as has been done in previous studies .",
    "@xcite there are at least two reasons for that : first , this bridges the gap to the cellular dynamical mean - field theory ( c - dmft ) @xcite which is obtained in the limit of infinite number of bath degrees of freedom .",
    "second , bath sites are expected to become important for the study of doped systems as they can serve as a particle reservoir .    for doped systems , the variational optimization of one - particle parameters should include the on - site energy of the cluster sites as well as the additional consideration of a few bath sites .",
    "this is necessary to realize fillings which are not commensurate with the cluster size and to achieve smooth doping dependencies in the entire doping range .    in the present paper",
    "we have focused on a ficticious staggered magnetic field as a variational parameter to describe antiferromagnetic long - range order .",
    "moreover , one can envisage to introduce in the same way a ficticious pairing field in order to study off - diagonal long - range order and superconductivity . while this introduces the numerical difficulty of diagonalizing clusters without fixing the particle number , such an approach offers the exciting perspective of analyzing the effects of short - range correlations in the superconducting phase .",
