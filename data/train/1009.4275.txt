    "amongst approaches for scattered data approximation on the sphere , the hybrid interpolation scheme of von golitschek & light @xcite and sloan & sommariva @xcite , which employs both radial basis functions and spherical polynomials , seems an attractive method , especially when the data is concentrated in some regions ( such as over mountain ranges and trenches on the earth s surface ) , yet relatively sparse in other regions .",
    "the underlying idea is that radial basis functions can give good approximation for rapidly varying data over short distances , whereas the polynomial component can more effectively represent smooth variations on a global scale .",
    "the radial basis functions are centered at data points which are supposed given , and the linear combination of radial basis functions is constrained to be orthogonal , in a natural sense , to the finite dimensional space of polynomials",
    ".    however , the hybrid scheme poses difficulties in implementation , compared with a pure radial basis function approximation , when the number of centers is large . in the case of a pure radial basis function approximation with a ( strictly ) positive definite kernel ,",
    "the resulting linear system has a matrix that is positive definite , allowing an iterative solution by the conjugate gradient method , and preconditioning by , for example , the additive schwarz method , see @xcite . for the hybrid scheme , in contrast , the linear equations for the relevant expansion coefficients have the saddle - point form , see @xcite , @xmath0 \\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\bfalpha}\\\\ { \\bfbeta}\\end{array}\\right ] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\bff}_x\\\\ { \\bf{0 } } \\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is a positive definite matrix arising from the radial basis function part of the function approximation , and @xmath2 is a matrix of spherical harmonics evaluated at the data centers , with @xmath3 .",
    "( the matrices @xmath4 and @xmath5 are defined properly in section 2 ) .",
    "the saddle - point structure means that the overall matrix is not positive definite , and that the conjugate gradient method is no longer a suitable iterative solver .",
    "more fundamentally , because the matrix has both positive and negative eigenvalues , the problem of constructing a good preconditioner becomes more delicate . for a thorough review of strategies and challenges for the numerical solution of saddle - point problems ,",
    "see @xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we concentrate on the stability of the saddle - point formulation of this hybrid scheme , and devise and validate a rapid preconditioned iterative solution method for the solution of the equations from the approximation .",
    "we make use of the brezzi stability and convergence theorem well known in the context of mixed finite elements , along with the new inf - sup condition of @xcite to establish convergence of the approximation scheme ; and then use the inf - sup condition to obtain an optimal preconditioner .",
    "a leading contender amongst the solution methods for equations with the structure ( see @xcite ) is the block preconditioning method of @xcite employing an approximation to the schur complement @xmath6 the use of schur complement approximations in preconditioners is by now well established ( see for example @xcite ) in the setting of mixed finite element methods . in particular",
    ", verfrth @xcite showed that for the mixed finite element approximation of the stokes flow problem the schur complement is spectrally equivalent to the identity operator ( or to the mass matrix or @xmath7 projection matrix in the finite element setting ) , making this a suitable approximation to the schur complement .",
    "verfrth s proof makes essential use of the babuska - brezzi or inf - sup condition ( assumption 2.1 in @xcite ) , see @xcite .    in the present setting ,",
    "the schur complement turns out to be spectrally equivalent not to the identity operator / matrix , but rather to a specific diagonal but non - constant matrix .",
    "this spectral equivalence , a main result of the paper , is stated in theorem [ spectral_equiv ] .",
    "the key ingredient here , in analogy with the known inf - sup condition for the stokes flow problem , is the inf - sup stability condition recently established by sloan and wendland @xcite for the hybrid approximation problem .",
    "an approximate solver for the primal operator ( the radial basis function interpolation matrix in this case ) is also required .",
    "this could be provided , for example , by the domain decomposition method of le gia , sloan and tran @xcite , or by any other preconditioner for the pure radial basis function problem .",
    "the resulting block diagonal preconditioner is symmetric and positive definite , hence the preconditioned minres method ( @xcite,@xcite ) is applicable to the full problem ( which is symmetric but not positive definite ) .",
    "in section 2 we formulate the hybrid approximation scheme and establish notation .",
    "then in section 3 we describe the inf - sup condition of @xcite , and use the brezzi theorem to establish stability and convergence of the scheme . in section 4",
    "we turn to preconditioning , establishing there the main spectral equivalence result . in section 5",
    "numerical results are presented ( using the primal preconditioner of @xcite ) and we conclude in section 6 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a set of @xmath9 distinct points on the sphere @xmath10 in @xmath11 . using these as centers we define a radial basis function approximation space @xmath12 with a suitable kernel function @xmath13 .",
    "the kernel is assumed to be ( strictly ) positive definite , that is @xmath14 for every set of points @xmath15 and for all @xmath16 , with equality for distinct points @xmath17 only if @xmath18    the native space @xmath19 is defined as the completion under the inner product @xmath20 of the linear space @xmath21 where we insist that the points @xmath22 are distinct",
    ". the norm is as usual defined by @xmath23 it is well - known that @xmath19 is a reproducing kernel hilbert space ( see @xcite ) with the reproducing kernel @xmath24 .",
    "that is @xmath25 and for @xmath26 @xmath27 the kernel function @xmath13 needs to be positive definite in order that the inner product @xmath28 satisfy the positivity axiom for an inner product .",
    "equivalently , the matrices @xmath29 defined by @xmath30 are positive definite as well as symmetric for every @xmath31 and every @xmath32 .",
    "taking now a fixed @xmath32 and a fixed set @xmath33 , we may define the usual radial basis function interpolant to a continuous function @xmath34 on @xmath10 by @xmath35 where @xmath36 are such that @xmath37 which we may write as @xmath38 that is , the vector @xmath39 of coefficients satisfies @xmath40 where @xmath41    the hybrid approximation scheme of von golitschek & light @xcite and sloan & sommariva , see @xcite , employs not only the radial basis functions , but also spherical polynomials of total degree up to some conveniently chosen @xmath42 we define @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a spherical harmonic of degree @xmath45 , that is , the restriction to @xmath10 of a homogeneous harmonic polynomial in @xmath11 of degree @xmath45 , and @xmath46 is the dimension of the space spanned by the spherical harmonics of degree @xmath45 .",
    "then @xmath47 is the set of spherical polynomials of degree @xmath48 .",
    "we shall assume that @xmath49 is an orthonormal set with respect to the usual @xmath7 inner product , that is @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes surface measure on @xmath10 .",
    "then it is well known that @xmath49 is a complete orthonormal basis for @xmath52 .    for a given function @xmath34 ,",
    "the hybrid approximation scheme is then to find @xmath53 and @xmath54 such that @xmath55 or equivalently , @xmath56 which is to be solved subject to the side condition @xmath57 the condition ( [ 2nd ] ) is equivalent , via , to @xmath58 for all @xmath59 , forcing the radial basis function component to be @xmath60-orthogonal to @xmath47 .",
    "it also ensures that the defining linear system is square and symmetric .",
    "the conditions ( [ 1st]),([2nd ] ) can also be seen to be those which derive from the solution of the constrained optimization problem @xmath61 for all @xmath62 , the coefficients @xmath63 being the lagrange multipliers in the lagrangian @xmath64 this is therefore another way of expressing the hybrid approximation problem .    by choosing the spherical harmonic functions as the basis for @xmath47 in ( [ 2nd ] ) , we can write ( [ 1st]),([2nd ] ) as a so - called ` saddle - point ' linear system of equations @xmath65 \\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\bfalpha}\\\\ { \\bfbeta}\\end{array}\\right ] = \\left[\\begin{array}{c}{\\bff}_x\\\\ { \\bf{0 } } \\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is defined by ( [ axphi ] ) , @xmath66 is the vector of coefficients @xmath67 as defined above , @xmath68 is a vector containing the coefficients @xmath63 for @xmath69 , and @xmath70 is the @xmath71 matrix defined by @xmath72 and @xmath73    in the present application we need to prescribe more precisely the nature of the kernel @xmath74 . in the first place we shall assume that it is zonal , meaning that @xmath75 for some function @xmath76 $ ] , where @xmath77 denotes the euclidean inner product in @xmath78 .",
    "more precisely , we shall assume that @xmath74 has an expansion of the form @xmath79 with @xmath80 for all @xmath81 .",
    "that the expansion is zonal follows from the addition theorem for spherical harmonics , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the legendre polynomial of degree @xmath45 in dimension @xmath84 normalized to @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the total surface measure of @xmath10 , @xmath87 in this situation it is well known that the inner product in @xmath60 can be written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 indeed , as a special case of ( [ fiprod ] ) we find @xmath90 thus verifying the reproducing kernel property ( [ rep ] ) .",
    "if we further assume that for large @xmath45 @xmath91 then it follows from ( [ fiprod ] ) and ( [ ass3 ] ) that the native space @xmath60 is equivalent to the sobolev space @xmath92 with inner product @xmath93    technicalities aside , we remark that the essential difficulty in analysing the hybrid approximation is that @xmath94 and @xmath47 are both subsets of @xmath60 , and that in an appropriate sense both can approximate @xmath60 as @xmath9 or @xmath95 tend to @xmath96 .",
    "we need the inf - sup condition , now to be introduced , to allow both subspaces to coexist comfortably within the one approximation .",
    "typically , uniqueness of the solution and optimal error estimates for saddle - point problems follow from so - called inf - sup conditions together with appropriate coercivity of the primal operator . for us",
    "an essential tool will be the following inf - sup theorem proved in @xcite . in this theorem @xmath97 , for a given point",

    "now we turn our attention to the linear algebra aspects of the hybrid approximation described in section 2 .",
