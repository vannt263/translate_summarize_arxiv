    "the zero - energy majorana modes have recently become a topic of many investigations in condensed matter physics , perhaps due to the concomitant non - abelian statistics@xcite and potential applications to fault - tolerant quantum computation@xcite . in a weakly - coupled triplet @xmath1-wave superconductor , for example , one such zero - mode was found in the core of a half - vortex , and two pairs of such vortices are required to perform the non - abelian braiding operations@xcite .",
    "the vortex bound states were , of course , already studied a long ago by caroli , de gennes , and matricon in a @xmath0-wave weak - coupling superconductor,@xcite but a pair of true zero - modes was discovered only much later , by kopnin and salomaa in a triplet superfluid@xcite .",
    "both studies were performed within the framework of bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations which describe the low - energy electron - hole excitations around the _ degenerate _ fermi surfaces in the presence of superconducting instability .",
    "the degenerate fermi surfaces can be split , and the superconducting order parameter can contain both the spin singlet and triplet components when the inversion symmetry is broken@xcite .",
    "for example , the corresponding vortex bound states in a noncentrosymmetric superconductor,@xcite or the andreev bound states on the domain wall@xcite have also been studied . the existence of such zero - modes has been shown to depend on a z@xmath2 topological invariant associated the mixed order parameter@xcite .",
    "the metallic surface of a topological insulator ( ti ) resembles the noncentrosymmetric material , as in both cases the fermi surfaces are chiral , i.e. the projection of the spin is locked to the direction of the momentum . however , an important difference is that the surface of the topological insulator has a only one such fermi surface @xcite .",
    "recently , an interesting system consisting of this peculiar surface subjected to the superconducting proximity effect has been proposed to bind one majorana zero - mode inside a @xmath0-wave vortex core of unit vorticity@xcite .",
    "this zero - mode is nothing but the mid - gap state of the jackiw - rossi - dirac hamiltonian@xcite ( jrd ) , studied before in the context of charge fractionalization in polyacetylene@xcite and graphene,@xcite with its existence assured by an index theorem@xcite . in addition",
    ", the zero - modes of the jrd hamiltonian have also been studied recently in the context of the insulating @xcite and superconducting states on the graphene s honeycomb lattice@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the existence and the form of the zero - modes of a class of the general jrd hamiltonians describing paired dirac fermions in presence of a superconducting vortex in the spin - triplet @xmath1-wave state , and in the mixed singlet - triplet state , when the inversion symmetry is absent .",
    "we pay special attention to the effects of a finite chemical potential@xcite and the magnetic fields on the zero mode , which are all present in real systems .",
    "the problem under study is also relevant to graphene , where different symmetries of the superconducting phases have also been considered@xcite . in graphene in particular , other exotic manifestations of the physics of zero - modes",
    "become possible due to their rich internal structure , consisting of spin , valley , sublattice , and the nambu degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "it is therefore of importance to understand the general conditions for the appearance of the zero - energy states .",
    "quite generally , we find that the zero - modes in the superconducting vortex may exist only for weak enough zeeman coupling to the magnetic field .",
    "this is in accord with our previous study limited to the the vortex in the s - wave superconducting order parameter@xcite .",
    "this paper has the following organization .",
    "we first investigate the spectrum associated with the spatially homogeneous hamiltonian without vortex for the singlet @xmath0-wave , triplet @xmath1-wave and mixed - symmetry cases .",
    "the conditions for opening of a gap in all three cases are discussed .",
    "we then proceed to the equations for the zero - mode associated with different pairing symmetries , with the zeeman term and the chemical potential included . in the sec .",
    "iv , the effects of the zeeman field and the relation of the zero - mode with the antilinear operator that provides the reflection symmetry of the spectrum@xcite in all symmetry cases are discussed .",

    "the general pairing potential @xmath12 that respects the absence of inversion symmetry and takes different coupling channels ( spin singlet and triplet ) into account needs to be be expressed as a matrix.@xcite to this purpose we introduce the general mass matrix @xmath13 , so that the pairing potential becomes @xmath14 . here",

    "these cases will lead to a peculiar spectrum that is not possible in standard superconductors which have the quadratic energy - momentum dispersion in its normal state .",
    "first , let us discuss different pairing symmetries for the mass term , in the translation - invariant situation without the vortex , and the resulting spectrum @xmath26 .",
    "the simplest case corresponds to the singlet s - wave pairing in which @xmath15 is constant and @xmath16=0 .",
    "the spectrum may be obtained most easily by squaring the hamiltonian and using the anticommuting properties of the pauli matrices ; this gives @xmath27 ^ 2=(v_f\\vec{n}(\\vec{k})\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}-\\mu)^2+m^2 $ ] , and therefore @xmath28.@xcite",
    "next we consider the triplet pairing , with the vector @xmath29 coinciding with @xmath30 , in which the mass term @xmath31 still anticommutes with the kinetic energy .",

    "a somewhat unusual situation arises when @xmath33 , for which the mass term _ commutes _ with the kinetic energy : when @xmath34 , @xmath35$]=0 .",
    "it can be shown that the spectrum is then given by @xmath36 . in this case",
    "the spectrum is still gapless , and it is the chemical potential that becomes modified and momentum - dependent , loosely speaking@xcite .    in the absence of the inversion symmetry the general  mixed \" mass term , with both @xmath15 and @xmath16 finite , is also allowed .",
    "let us assume the triplet component to be given by @xmath37 . by squaring the hamiltonian , one can obtain , @xmath27 ^ 2=(v_f\\vec{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma}-\\mu)^2+(\\delta_s+v_{\\delta}\\vec{n}\\cdot\\vec{\\sigma})^2 $ ] , and consequently    e()=,[mixedspec ] where a gapped spectrum exists only for the positive helicity branch when @xmath38 , with the fermi wavevector @xmath39 .",
    "in this section we shall consider the inhomogeneity in the mass term @xmath40 generated by an isolated vortex in which the magnetic field applied along @xmath3 is threading through its core .",
    "the superconducting phase changes by @xmath41 on circling once around the core . here",
    "@xmath42 labels the winding number of the vortex . in the context of superconductivity ,",
    "the mass term here is in general a function of both the center - of - mass position @xmath43 and relative momentum @xmath4 of the cooper pair , namely , @xmath44 .",
    "more explicitly , in the polar coordinate @xmath45 , the vortex enters the mass via @xmath46 . in the following subsections",

    "the terms related to @xmath72 can be dropped since @xmath72 decay faster than @xmath73 in the case of a isolated vortex@xcite .",

    "as long as @xmath77 , the two solutions for @xmath66 are both exploding at infinity , which , from eq.([forb1 ] ) , is also true for @xmath69 .",
