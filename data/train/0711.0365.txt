    "thus the derived analytical expression for the critical current can be used as a tool to fit experimental data in various types of sifs junctions .",
    "we have discussed the details of the damped oscillatory behavior of the critical current for different values of the f layer parameters .",
    "we also studied the superconducting dos induced in a ferromagnet by the proximity effect .",
    "we showed that the oscillation pattern of dos at the fermi energy in the ferromagnet ( at location of the tunnel junction ) does not coincide with that of the critical current in a sifs junction and it s period is approximately twice smaller .",
    "therefore the dos oscillations do not reflect the @xmath107-@xmath2 transition in @xmath118 .",
    "we calculated the quasiparticle dos in the f layer in the close vicinity of the tunnel barrier which can be used to obtain current - voltage characteristics for a sifs junction .",
    "these calculations will be presented elsewhere .",
