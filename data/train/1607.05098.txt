    "whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) resonators are a powerful and versatile tool in modern day optics and have found great employ as novel light sources @xcite , in spectroscopic studies @xcite , frequency comb generation @xcite , quantum electrodynamics @xcite , sensing @xcite , nonlinear optics @xcite and optomechanics @xcite .",

    "primarily , the resonance structure of wgm resonators is dictated by their geometry and material composition , however , tunability of resonance properties , such as central frequency and line width , is desirable in a number of applications .",
    "for example , wgm microcavities can be used as tunable filters or switches , which play a central role in optical signal processing and classical communication networks @xcite . alternatively , matching the frequency and bandwidth of wgms to those of atomic transitions @xcite enables efficient light - matter coupling required in quantum communications @xcite and information processing @xcite . controlled coupling and differential tuning of wgm resonances",

    "so - called dielectric tuning , in which a dielectric substrate is brought into close proximity to a wgm resonator , has also been proposed and demonstrated as a route to continuous fine tuning @xcite . in this work",
    ", we present a detailed theoretical formalism describing dielectric frequency tuning of wgm resonances using planar substrates , in addition to quantifying substrate induced line width changes .",
    "emphasis is especially placed on the use of arbitrary uniaxial dielectric planar substrates , which we show can enable differential tuning and selective coupling of transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) wgms @xcite .",
    "the structure of this article is therefore as follows . in section  [ sec : wgms ]",
    "we first generalise the analytic wgm profiles given in @xcite to account for the open nature of wgm resonators and detail the properties of wgms in an isolated uniaxial axisymmetric resonator required in subsequent derivations . after establishing a suitable angular spectrum representation of wgms in section  [ sec : pert_modes ] we continue to determine the interface induced coupling and resulting mode distributions in the presence of a uniaxial dielectric prism ( note we shall use the terms prism and substrate interchangeably throughout this text ) .",
    "resonance shifts and mode broadening induced by introduction of a planar substrate are subsequently derived by exploiting the bethe - schwinger cavity perturbation formula in section  [ sec : shifts ] .",

    "it should also be noted that since modes of fixed @xmath43 have been considered here , modes of differing ( @xmath381 ) have different resonant frequencies .",
    "nevertheless , if wgms of approximately fixed wavelength are chosen ( and @xmath43 varied accordingly ) a similar ordering is also found .",
    "in addition to the resonance shifts discussed in the previous section , introduction of a substrate can give rise to coupling of the wgm into the far field and hence to mode broadening .",
    "intuitively , this phenomenon can be understood since coupling to propagating waves in the substrate introduces additional loss channels for the wgm , yielding a shorter resonance lifetime . since propagating waves are only excited when the effective refractive index of the substrate is larger than that seen by the wgm in the resonator , we now consider only the effect of either a linbo@xmath328 or tio@xmath361 substrate .",
    "figure  [ fig : broad](a ) shows the mode broadening determined using eq .",
    "( [ eq : final_shift ] ) as a function of the orientation of the optic axis of the substrate .",
    "anisotropy of the substrate implies that a given wgm can couple to both ordinary and extraordinary polarised waves in the substrate , such that the mode broadening results from the net effect of both channels .",
    "accordingly , we also show the individual contributions from the ordinary and extraordinary beams in the leftmost columns of figure  [ fig : broad](a ) .        initially considering a tio@xmath361 substrate",
    ", we again note that as @xmath359 is increased to @xmath371 the refractive index seen by te ( @xmath349 polarised ) wgms decreases .",
    "lower transmission into the far field hence results such that the mode broadening is reduced .",
    "moreover , as the optic axis is rotated the ordinary and extraordinary polarisation vectors also rotate , such that the ordinary and extraordinary waves play complementary roles .",
    "for instance , when @xmath355 the te mode couples to only extraordinary waves in the substrate , however , if @xmath382 a strong ordinary component can also be excited .",
    "proportionally , the relative strength with which te modes couple to ordinary waves varies with @xmath360 .",
    "a weakly singular point is seen in the plots of figure  [ fig : broad](a ) corresponding to the case where @xmath383 . when this condition is meet there is a minimum ( maximum ) in the refractive index experienced by the central angular component of the extraordinary wave when propagating in a positively ( negatively ) birefringent material .",
    "furthermore , the polarisation vector @xmath246 is undefined for this angular component , such that a plane wave component propagating with wavevector parallel to @xmath68 does so as a pure ordinarily polarised wave .",
    "nevertheless , for an out - coupled wgm the extraordinary beam still carries a finite ( albeit relatively small ) amount of power to the far field due to the finite width of the incident angular spectrum . for an isotropic substrate ,",
    "the ordinary and extraordinary wave vectors are equal and the complementarity of the corresponding beams is exact in the sense that a decrease in the energy carried by the ordinary beam resulting from a change in @xmath68 , is compensated by an increase of equal magnitude in that of the extraordinary wave .",
    "quantitative differences arise for anisotropic substrates however ( as seen in figure  [ fig : broad](a ) ) , due to the differing dependence of the generalised fresnel transmission coefficients and since @xmath384 and @xmath385 are not parallel .",
    "similar , albeit reversed arguments apply for a tm wgm coupled to a tio@xmath361 substrate .",
    "when broadening of wgms of differing polar and radial orders is considered , a similar hierarchy to that for resonance shifts is again found ( see figure  [ fig : shift](c ) ) .    when a linbo@xmath328 substrate is brought into close proximity to a wgm resonator ,",
    "markedly different behaviour can be seen . as noted in the previous section ,",
    "a te wgm always couples to propagating waves in the substrate yielding similar behaviour to that seen for a tio@xmath361 substrate ( allowing for differences arising from the sign of the birefringence of each material ) .",
    "in contrast a tm mode mostly couples to evanescent waves except for within a restricted range of @xmath68 corresponding to that bounded by the grey dashed circle in figure  [ fig : broad](a ) . only relative weak broadening of the tm mode hence results .",
    "dependence of the partial mode broadening , originating from the ordinary and extraordinary waves individually , on @xmath68 is in contrast to the propagating wave case dominated by the non - radiative component ( @xmath386 ) of the bethe - schwinger equation since the radiative losses are so low .",
    "importantly , net mode broadening of tm wgms perturbed by a linbo@xmath328 substrate is nevertheless governed by the radiative loss ( @xmath374 ) term as per physical intuition , since the near field ( @xmath386 ) contributions from the ordinary and extraordinary waves are equal and opposite in magnitude and therefore precisely sum to zero .",
    "we briefly note , that the sudden transition from mode broadening to mode narrowing ( and vice - versa ) seen at @xmath387 in the individual loss channels is an artifact of the definition of the ( extra-)ordinary polarisation and wave vectors and is not of physical significance , especially considering there is no net effect from both channels .",
    "given that a linbo@xmath328 substrate produces significant broadening of te , but not tm , modes we note that this scenario corresponds to polarisation selective coupling of wgms as has recently been experimentally demonstrated @xcite . maximum extinction ratios , that is to say the relative coupling rates , are achieved when @xmath68 lies in the @xmath117-@xmath292 plane ( @xmath388 ) , specifically along the @xmath66 axis ( @xmath389 ) . in this case",
    "extinction ratios @xmath390 ( or equivalently @xmath391  db ) are predicted corresponding to a strong degree of selectivity .",
    "finally , in this section we briefly consider the geometric properties of out coupled propagating ordinary and extraordinary beams in a uniaxial substrate when it is brought close to a wgm resonator .",
    "specifically we seek expressions for the output angle of the beams and the angular widths as defined in figure  [ fig : broad](b ) , which are important parameters in mode identification @xcite .",
    "similar considerations for the emission patterns of wgms supported in spheroidal resonators coupled using isotropic prisms were given by gorodetsky and ilchenko @xcite , however , here we provide the corresponding expressions for a uniaxial prism .",
    "most importantly , it should be noted that use of a uniaxial prism means that the angular components of the wgm each undergo double refraction , such that two beams are output in different directions and with differing polarisation state .",
    "depending on the magnitude of the substrate birefringence and optic axis orientation , these two beams can , however , partially or completely overlap .",
    "we begin by first writing the wavevector of a general angular component in the form @xmath392 $ ] ( see figure  [ fig : geometry ] ) . noting that the transverse wave components of each angular component are conserved across the substrate interface we can deduce the output angle in the @xmath117-@xmath292 plane ( @xmath393 ) by considering @xmath394 for @xmath395 .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath396 the output angles in the @xmath11 direction require a slightly more detailed analysis . within the gaussian window",
    "the scalar mode profile incident on the interface is an oscillatory function such that it follows that , except for the trivial case of @xmath397 for which @xmath398 , two distinct peaks located symmetrically about @xmath252 are expected in the far field ( as shown in figures  [ fig : broad](b ) and ( c ) ) . as an approximation we first consider the @xmath134 dependence of the incident angular spectrum neglecting the effect of the gaussian coupling window which can be easily shown to be given by the hermite functions . to first order",
    ", the output beams correspond to the outermost peaks of the hermite functions , which can be well approximated as @xmath399 h_p(u ) \\sim 2^{(2p+1)/4 } \\sqrt{\\pi ( p-1 ) ! } \\ ,",

    "the asymmetry of the outermost peak of the hermite functions , however , gives rise to an additional angular displacement in the final output beam , whereby we numerically find that @xmath405 \\nonumber\\\\ & \\quad\\quad\\quad+ \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac{\\kappa}{p } + \\frac{1}{p^2\\theta_m^2}\\right]^{1/2}.\\label{eq : beamparam2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] determination of the angular widths of the output beams follows by making the approximation @xmath406 ( and similarly for @xmath407 ) . within this approximation",

    "( [ eq : beamparam1 ] ) , ( [ eq : beamparam3 ] ) and ( [ eq : beamparam4 ] ) possess slight differences due to differing definitions of the angles and the shape of resonators considered .",
    "( [ eq : beamparam2 ] ) however differs from that of @xcite due to the method of derivation , although we find eq .",
    "( [ eq : beamparam2 ] ) gives good numerical agreement with the positions of the peaks .",
    "we emphasis , however , that the output beam profiles shown in figure  [ fig : broad](c ) are further modulated by the fresnel transmission coefficients . due to the narrow width of the angular spectrum",
    "the associated variation of the transmission coefficients is small , however , if coupling to either ordinary or extraordinary propagating waves in the substrate is close to cut - off , then strong variation can occur resulting in so - called fresnel filtering @xcite and a truncated output beam profile .",
    "in this article we have theoretically studied the properties of wgms in a @xmath11-cut uniaxial axisymmetric resonator placed in close proximity to a planar dielectric substrate , such as a prism .",
    "to do so , we first extended the approximate unperturbed mode profiles provided by breunig et al .",
    "@xcite to account for the open nature of the resonator and the vectorial nature of the underlying electromagnetic fields . upon establishing an analytic angular spectrum representation of wgms ( eq .  ( [ eq : angspec ] ) ) we proceeded to study",
    "prism induced coupling to other wgms and rigorously proved that coupling between modes of differing azimuthal order and parity was forbidden . within a resonant mode approximation we subsequently derived expressions for the wgm profiles in the presence of a substrate , including reflection from and transmission through the interface ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : er_approx ] ) , ( [ eq : et_nf_tetm_app ] ) and ( [ eq : et_nf_tetm_app2 ] ) ) .",
    "we have furthermore presented an analytic formalism capable of quantitatively predicting the resonance shifts and mode broadening that result from bringing a planar dielectric substrate from infinity into the evanescent field of a wgm ( eq .  ( [ eq : final_shift ] ) ) .",
    "our analysis was based on a generalisation of the bethe - schwinger perturbation equation which accounts for far - field radiative contributions and is hence suitable for application to open cavities @xcite .",
    "importantly , through use of generalised fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients our theory can account for uniaxial substrates with an arbitrarily oriented optic axis and , moreover , is applicable to disc , toroidal and ellipsoidal shaped resonators , therefore extending alternative coupling theories that can be found in the literature @xcite to previously unconsidered geometries .    to support our theoretical developments ,",
    "extensive numerical examples were also presented .",
    "competing red and blue shifts were found to dictate the total change in resonance frequency .",
    "the former red shift is well known and derives from the work done in polarising the dielectric substrate , however , the second less familiar effect originates from interference between the unperturbed and perturbed radiative component of the wgm in the far field , or a so - called radiative back action . relative dominance of each effect was found to be influenced by the both the mode polarisation and the refractive index of the perturbing substrate relative to that of the resonator , since the latter determines whether wgms couple to evanescent or propagating waves in the substrate . for both te and tm wgms",
    ", maximum red shifts occur when the refractive index of the perturbing substrate is approximately equal to that of the resonator , however , for larger substrate indices , the radiative contribution begins to dominate , leading not only to anomalous blue shifts , but also to significant mode broadening .",
    "an optimal regime , with respect to the substrate refractive index , in which maximum coupling can be achieved was also observed .",
    "coupling of wgms to the far field by means of a uniaxial prism , however , can manifest itself through two distinct channels , namely those of ordinary and extraordinary propagating waves .",
    "orientation of the optic axis plays a central role in governing the relative losses between these channels .",
    "exceptionally , when the resonator and substrate are fabricated from the same ( birefringent ) material this dependence renders polarisation selective coupling with a high extinction ratio possible .",
    "optimal selective coupling is found when the optic axis of the resonator and substrate are chosen to lie parallel to the resonator s symmetry axis ( @xmath11-cut ) and perpendicular to the substrate interface ( @xmath117-cut ) respectively . finally , we have discussed double refraction of a wgm into ordinary and extraordinary waves propagating in a nearby anisotropic substrate and moreover provided analytic formulae ( eqs .",

    "<S> optical whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) resonators are a powerful and versatile tool used in many branches of science . </S>",
    "<S> fine tuning of the central frequency and line width of individual resonances is however desirable in a number of applications including frequency conversion , optical communications and efficient light - matter coupling . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we present a detailed theoretical analysis of dielectric tuning of wgms supported in axisymmetric resonators . using the bethe - schwinger equation and adopting an angular spectrum field representation we study the resonance shift and mode broadening of high @xmath0 wgms when a planar dielectric substrate is brought close to the resonator . </S>",
    "<S> particular focus is given to use of a uniaxial substrate with an arbitrarily aligned optic axis . </S>",
    "<S> competing red and blue resonance shifts ( @xmath1  mhz ) , deriving from generation of a near field material polarisation and back action from the radiation continuum respectively , are found . </S>",
    "<S> anomalous resonance shifts can hence be observed depending on the substrate material , whereas mode broadening on the order of @xmath2  mhz can also be simply realised . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , polarisation selective coupling with extinction ratios of @xmath3 can be achieved when the resonator and substrate are of the same composition and their optic axes are chosen correctly . </S>",
    "<S> double refraction and properties of out - coupled beams are also discussed . </S>"
