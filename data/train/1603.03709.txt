    "zodiacal emission ( ze ) is thermal emission from interplanetary dust ( ipd ) .",
    "it dominates the diffuse radiation in the mid- to far - infrared ( ir ) wavelength regime .",
    "since the dust located at around 1 astronomical unit ( a.u . ) from the sun has a thermal equilibrium temperature of @xmath7 k , the ze exhibits a spectral peak around 1020  , which dominates the mid - ir brightness of the diffuse emission in the sky . even in the far - ir regime ,",
    "the ze contribution is non - negligible at high galactic latitudes , where galactic radiation is relatively weak .",
    "ipd originates mainly from comets and asteroids , and it is distributed across the solar system .",
    "the zodiacal dust cloud is characterized by a relatively smooth distribution , resulting in the dominant diffuse emission .",
    "however , observations with the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) revealed that small - scale structures ( on scales of a few to a few tens of degrees ) are present in the ze distribution , such as those tracing the asteroidal dust bands and a circumsolar resonance ring @xcite .",
    "the zodiacal dust bands were first discovered with iras in its 12  @xmath0 m to 100  @xmath0 m data @xcite .",
    "they have subsequently been confirmed by the diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) onboard the cosmic background explorer ( cobe ) , as well as by ground - based observations @xcite .",
    "they provide a link between the asteroidal source of the ipd and the present distribution of the zodiacal cloud .",
    "there are three major band pairs among the dust bands that form small - scale latitudinal features in the ze .",
    "they are thought to be produced by thermal emission from three pairs of circumsolar dust rings near inclinations with respect to the invariant plane of the planets , @xmath8 , @xmath2 , and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the two central bands ( at @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) are blended in low - resolution data ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , and high - resolution maps are required to identify and distinguish the band pairs . it has been proposed that recent disruption events among multi - kilometer bodies in the main asteroid belt , which would have occurred within the last several million years , may be major supply sources of dust particles , and they would produce edge - brightened toroidal dust distributions ( referred to as the `` catastrophic '' or `` non - equilibrium '' model ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent detailed studies @xcite have provided evidence supporting the disruption model as the possible origin of the asteroidal dust bands .",
    "@xcite proposed that the dust band characterized by an inclination of @xmath9 may have originated from the veritas asteroid family , at a distance of 3.17 a.u . from the sun , which formed through collisional disruption @xmath10 myr ago ,",
    "while the @xmath2 band may have originated from the karin family , which formed @xmath11 myr ago and is located inside the koronis asteroid family at a solar distance of 2.87 a.u .",
    "@xcite . @xcite also proposed a recent breakup of the new candidate beagle asteroid family as the source of the @xmath1 band .",
    "dust from the asteroids and comets , which continues to spiral in towards the inner solar system , is subject to gravitational perturbations by the planets .",
    "the presence of a circumsolar ring ( i.e. , a ring structure of dust originating from the outer solar system that is resonantly trapped by the earth in orbits near 1 a.u . from the sun ) has been proposed theoretically ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the sky brightness near the ecliptic plane , as observed with iras , is brighter in the earth - trailing than in the leading direction @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed , based on numerical simulations , that this brightness asymmetry is caused by a trailing blob of dust particles trapped in mean - motion resonances ( mmrs ) with the earth .",
    "this earth s resonance structure has been confirmed using cobe / dirbe observations @xcite . the existence of a similar circumsolar ring at the orbit of venus has also been confirmed based on the imaging data of the stereo mission @xcite .",
    "in addition to these small - scale structures on scales of a few to a few tens of degrees , finer - scale features associated with the orbits of periodic comets , the so - called cometary dust trails , have also been observed in the iras survey data @xcite .    to determine the brightness distribution of the ze and the spatial structure of the ipd , full - sky surveys obtained with ir satellites are particularly powerful ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "subsequent to iras , cobe / dirbe conducted an all - sky survey with a wider wavelength coverage than iras @xcite .",
    "many efforts have been devoted to describing the structure of the zodiacal dust cloud , and a number of models have been developed using ir satellite data , including the iras and cobe / dirbe surveys @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used ze models are based on the dirbe data ( e.g. , @xcite : hereafter the kelsall model ; @xcite : hereafter the wright model ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the dirbe ze model in depth and modified the parameters of the wright model ( @xcite ) .",
    "the kelsall and the wright / gorjian models explain the ipd cloud complex with the following three components : a smooth cloud , asteroidal dust bands and an mmr component . in the kelsall model ,",
    "the mmr component is further divided into a circumsolar ring and a blob trailing the earth @xcite . for each of the three components ,",
    "parameterised functions have been introduced to describe the spatial distribution of the dust number density in heliocentric coordinates .",
    "these models , however , have limitations in their ability to reproduce small - scale structures . the cobe / dirbe team provided zodi - subtracted mission average ( zsma ) map data , which were created by subtracting the ze using the kelsall model week - by - week and averaging the residual intensity values .",
    "small - scale residual ze structures near the ecliptic plane can be seen clearly in the zsma maps , in particular at mid - ir wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore necessary to construct a ze model based on ir - satellite data with higher spatial resolution .    following the completion of the iras and cobe / dirbe missions , a few satellites",
    "have since conducted full - sky surveys in the ir regimes , including akari and the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) .",
    "table [ tab : irsurveys ] offers a comparison of major full - sky mid- and far - ir satellite surveys .",
    "the japanese satellite akari , a satellite dedicated to ir astronomical observations , was the third mission to survey the whole sky at mid- and far - ir wavelengths @xcite .",
    "although most of the smooth ze structure seen in the akari mid- and far - ir images can be reproduced well with the kelsall or the wright / gorjian models , there are discrepancies on small scales @xcite . in particular , the intensities and the ecliptic latitudes of the peak positions of the asteroidal dust bands and the mmrs can not be precisely reproduced with these models @xcite . the dirbe model can not reproduce the real fine structure of the asteroidal dust - band components , because dirbe operated with a large @xmath12 beam , and only a small fraction of the dirbe data were used to construct the dirbe ze model @xcite . @xcite also reported an inconsistency of 20% in the intensity of the ring component between the akari observations and the kelsall model prediction in the mid - ir regime . since the ze is the nearest source of diffuse emission to the earth and an important foreground component for studies of galactic and extragalactic emission at ir wavelengths , it is extremely important to understand the nature of the zodiacal dust cloud , not only for solar system science .",
    "it is crucial to precisely evaluate the contribution of the ze to the ir sky brightness .",
    "the diffuse emission in the far - ir regime is , for instance , a direct measure of the column density of the interstellar dust , and a full - sky far - ir map can also be used as a measure of the extinction for the emission from extragalactic objects . a careful treatment of the ze is also required for the construction of extinction maps @xcite .",
    "we performed an all - sky survey with the akari satellite @xcite .",
    "the all - sky far - ir map data have been publicly released @xcite .",
    "akari covers wavelengths longer than 100  @xmath13 and has a higher spatial resolution ( 1@xmath141.5@xmath14 ) than iras .",
    "it is important to obtain a precise estimate of the ze contribution to the far - ir sky and provide a ze template and ze - subtracted far - ir maps based on the akari data .",
    "this paper is part of a series in which we present akari far - ir diffuse emission map data .",
    "@xcite provide detailed descriptions of both the akari far - ir all - sky survey and the data - processing scheme applied to the all - sky maps .",
    "@xcite report on the calibration process and quality of the akari far - ir all - sky maps . in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the residual ze contribution , in particular of the zodiacal dust bands , in the publicly released akari far - ir maps and discuss the akari ze - distribution template maps .",
    "we extract the structure of the zodiacal dust bands from the akari far - ir maps and briefly discuss their observed properties .",
    "the main goal of this study is to provide ze template maps and ze - subtracted far - ir maps based on the akari far - ir all - sky survey data .",
    "detailed analysis of the dynamics of the dust bands , much smaller - scale structures ( such as cometary dust trails ) and the construction of a three - dimensional ze model ( such as the kelsall model ) are beyond the scope of this study but will be explored in forthcoming papers .",
    "akari was designed as an all - sky survey mission in the mid- and far - ir wavelength regime @xcite .",
    "the satellite was equipped with a cryogenically cooled telescope of 68.5  cm aperture diameter and two scientific instruments , the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ; @xcite ) and the infrared camera ( irc ; @xcite ) .",
    "akari was launched in 2006 february and the all - sky survey was performed during the period 2006 april to 2007 august , which was the cold operation phase of the satellite , when it was cooled with liquid helium cryogen .",
    "its 16-month cryogenic mission lifetime is thus by far the longest among the far - ir survey missions .",
    "the all - sky survey observations at far - ir wavelengths were performed by employing the fis instrument @xcite .",
    "four photometric bands were used : the n60 band ( 5080  , centred at 65  ) , the wide - s band ( 50110  , centred at 90  ) , the wide - l band ( 110180  , centred at 140  ) and the n160 band ( 140180  , centred at 160  ) . the akari far - ir all - sky survey maps , which have a better spatial resolution than the iras maps , were recently released publicly @xcite .",
    ".comparison of ir satellite survey observations ( sky coverage @xmath15% ) at mid- and far - ir wavelengths .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is also evident that the surface brightness of the dust bands varies as a function of ecliptic longitude .",
    "@xcite refer to the phenomenon that the northern component is bright when the southern component is faint , and _",
    "vice versa _ , as `` glints '' . in the dirbe maps ,",
    "the northern and southern glints occur roughly 180@xmath16 apart , while the leading and trailing maps are roughly 180@xmath16 out of phase @xcite .",
    "although the difference between the leading and trailing direction is faint , similar dust - band glints are detected in the akari maps , and can be seen in the component maps ( figure [ fig : zemodel_lt ] ) in particular for the @xmath17 band .",
    "we also performed sinusoidal fits to the longitudinal brightness variations of the northern and southern components .",
    "based on the brightnesses , latitudes and band widths derived from the sinusoidal fitting procedure outlined above ( see tables [ tab : gaussian ] and [ tab : geometry ] , figure [ fig : peak ] ) , we constructed a model map for the dust - band structure in the far - ir regime .",

    "greyscale as in figure [ fig : ltmaps].,width=642 ]      since these component model maps were derived from the ( @xmath18 ) difference map , the surface brightness of the model map is fainter than the real brightness of the dust bands in the wide - s map . to construct dust - band template maps for the four fis bands , we considered the temperatures of the dust - band components .",
    "as derived in section 3.1 , the @xmath19 and @xmath3 dust bands have radii of 1.86 a.u . and 2.16 a.u .",
    ", respectively . it can thus be expected that the @xmath19 and @xmath3 components have typical temperatures of @xmath20  k and @xmath21  k , respectively .",
    "we assume a temperature for the circumsolar ring component of 278  k , because the circumsolar ring is expected to be composed of dust in the earth s orbit ( 1  a.u . ) .",
    "if we assume that the dust temperatures of the dust bands are @xmath22  k , 200  k , and 278  k , their brightnesses relative to those of the wide - s band data are 1.376 , 1.390 and 1.439 for the n60 band , 0.212 , 0.208 and 0.193 for the wide - l band , and 0.133 , 0.130 and 0.119 for the n160 band , respectively . to construct the corresponding dust - band maps in the four fis bands for the circumsolar - ring component ( @xmath23  k ) , we multiplied the brightness of the component model by the following factors :    * n60 : @xmath24 ; * wide - s : @xmath25 ; *",
    "wide - l : @xmath26 ; * n160 : @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath19 and @xmath3 band - pair maps were derived similarly , and we constructed the akari dust - band templates using these component maps as follows .",
    "the publicly released akari maps have been processed with data in both the leading and trailing directions obtained during different semi - annual seasons . to construct the ze template of the dust bands for the akari maps , we need to take into account the numbers of observations of the leading and the trailing scans for each pixel .",
    "figure [ fig : season ] shows which of the leading and trailing scans cover the relevant sky regions . during the first 6 months , the leading scans observed the @xmath28 and @xmath29 regions , while the trailing scans covered @xmath30 . over the next 6 months , @xmath30 was covered by the leading scans , and @xmath28 and @xmath29 by the trailing scans . during the last 4 months",

    "in previous studies , structure in the dust bands was mainly discussed based on iras and dirbe data at 25  @xmath13 , because the band structure , in particular of the @xmath3 dust band , is faint at wavelengths longer than 60  @xmath13 @xcite . in the akari maps , we can detect the @xmath3 band structure much more clearly in the 65  @xmath13 and 90  @xmath13 bands , compared with the dirbe maps .",

    "@xcite made the simulations of orbital evolution for the dust particles released from the karin and veritas family .",
    "they estimated the relative contribution to the total ir surface brightness from particles at various distances , and suggest that the contribution of particles at further than 2 a.u .",
    "is stronger in the iras 60  @xmath13 than that at shorter wavelengths .",

    "similar to figure [ fig : latprofile ] , the image is centered at ecliptic longitude @xmath56 and latitude @xmath57 , covering a @xmath58 area in the leading direction , because this region is free of significant galactic dust emission . the image is spatially filtered by removing a boxcar average of 1@xmath16 width in the similar way to @xcite and @xcite , and we constructed a profile of the surface brightness as a function of ecliptic latitude , coadding in 10@xmath16 longitude ranges .",

    "<S> zodiacal emission is thermal emission from interplanetary dust . </S>",
    "<S> its contribution to the sky brightness is non - negligible in the region near the ecliptic plane , even in the far - infrared ( far - ir ) wavelength regime . </S>",
    "<S> we analyse zodiacal emission observed by the akari far - ir all - sky survey , which covers 97% of the entire sky at arcminute - scale resolution in four photometric bands , with central wavelengths of 65 , 90 , 140 , and 160  @xmath0 m . </S>",
    "<S> akari detected small - scale structures in the zodiacal dust cloud , including the asteroidal dust bands and the circumsolar ring , at far - ir wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> although the smooth component of the zodiacal emission structure in the far - ir sky can be reproduced well by models based on existing far - ir observations , previous zodiacal emission models have discrepancies in the small - scale structures compared with observations . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the geometry of the small - scale dust - band structures in the akari far - ir all - sky maps and construct template maps of the asteroidal dust bands and the circumsolar ring components based on the akari far - ir maps . in the maps , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> asteroidal dust - band structures are detected in the 65  @xmath0 m and 90  @xmath0 m bands . a possible @xmath4 band </S>",
    "<S> may also have been detected . </S>",
    "<S> no evident dust - band structures are identified in either the 140  @xmath0 m or the 160  @xmath0 m bands . by subtracting the dust - band templates constructed in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we can achieve a similar level of flux calibration of the akari far - ir all - sky maps in the @xmath5 region to that in the region for @xmath6 . </S>"
