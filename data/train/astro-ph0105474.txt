    "there has been a good deal of evidence on an obscuring torus of subparsec scale , which surrounds an active galactic nuclei ( agn ) ( antonucci 1984 ; wilson , ward , & haniff 1988 ; barthel 1989 ; blanco , ward , & wright 1990 ; miller & goodrich 1990 ; awaki et al . 1991 ; storchi - bergmann , mulchaey , & wilson 1992 ) .",
    "the obscuring torus is thought to be responsible for the dichotomy of agn type in the context of the unified model ( antonucci 1993 , for a review ) .",
    "however , the origin and physical structure of the torus has not been well elucidated , although some intriguing models are proposed by krolik & begelman ( 1988 ) , pier & krolik ( 1992a , 1992b , 1993 ) , efstathiou & rowan - robinson ( 1995 ) , and manske , henning , & menshchikov ( 1998 ) .",

    "the seyfert 2 galaxies are more frequently associated with the circumnuclear starbursts than type 1 s .",
    "in contrast , quasars ( qsos ) are mostly observed as type 1 , although the qso hosts often exhibit vigorous star - formation activity ( barvainis , antonucci , & coleman 1992 ; ohta et al .",

    "[ it is noted that the qso hosts are fainter than qso nuclei themselves ( mcleod & rieke 1995b ; bahcall et al .",

    "such correlation with circumnuclear starbursts seems beyond understanding based upon the picture of the unified model where the bifurcation of agn type is simply accounted for the orientation of the nucleus surrounded by an obscuring torus .",
    "we have some significant pieces of information on the obscuring materials .",
    "by x - ray observations , it is indicated that most seyfert 2 nuclei are heavily obscured along the line of sight with at least @xmath5 and sometimes @xmath6 ( matt et al .",

    "also , it is argued that a component of obscuring materials must be extended up to @xmath8 pc in addition to a compact component confined into subparsec scales ( rudy , cohen , & ake 1988 ; miller , goodrich , & mathews 1991 ; goodrich 1995 ; mcleod & rieke 1995a ; maiolino et al .",

    "these facts may suggest that the distributions of dusty gas around an agn are much more diverse than used to be considered , and they have a close relation with circumnuclear starburst events .",
    "recently , ohsuga & umemura ( 1999 , hereafter paper i ) have suggested a novel picture for the starburst - agn connection , where a large - scale dusty wall of several hundred parsecs is built up due to radiation force by a circumnuclear starburst as well as an agn .",
    "this model provides a possibility that an agn type is regulated by circumnuclear starbursts , and also it gives a physical origin of extended obscuring materials .",
    "however , the dusty wall was analyzed in an optically thin regime .",
    "thus , the possibility of the strong obscuration with @xmath9 is still an open question in this picture . in this paper , by taking the optical depth of dusty gas into consideration , we consider the effects of radiation force by a circumnuclear starburst as well as an agn , and investigate the stable configuration of dusty gas . to begin with",
    ", we solve hydrostatic equations coupled with the frequency - dependent radiative processes with assuming spherical symmetry . by this analysis",
    ", we demonstrate that a geometrically thin , optically thick wall forms due to radiation pressure by a starburst .",
    "next , we obtain the stable equilibrium configuration of dusty gas walls in two - dimensional axisymmetric space . finally , we attempt to classify the agn type according to the starburst luminosity and the agn luminosity . moreover ,",
    "taking account of the stellar evolution in starburst regions , we discuss the time evolution of the circumnuclear structure . in  2 , the radiation fields and gravitational fields are modeled . in  3 ,",
    "the structure of a dusty wall is analyzed in spherically symmetric approximation , demonstrating that a geometrically thin , optically thick wall can form due to radiation force by a starburst . in  4 ,",
    "the configuration of dusty gas in two - dimensional axisymmetric space is investigated with an approximation of geometrically - thin walls , and the conditions for the wall formation are given . in  5 , based upon the present picture , we discuss the implications for the starburst - agn connection .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of agn type which is predicted by the formation of the obscuring walls is shown in  6 .",
    " 7 is devoted to the conclusions .",
    "recent observations have been revealed that the circumnuclear starburst regions frequently exhibit ring - like features ( wilson et al .",
    "1991 ; forbes et al . 1994 ; marconi et al . 1994 ; mauder et al . 1994 ; buta , purcell , & crocker 1995 ; barth et al .",
    "1995 ; leitherer et al .",
    "1996 ; maoz et al . 1996 ; storchi - bergman , wilson , & baldmin 1996 ) . therefore , as a component of radiation sources",
    ", we assume a starburst ring whose bolometric luminosity , radius , and total mass are @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "[ even if the starburst regions are localized , the radiation fields could be equivalent to that by a ring - like source owing to the short rotation timescale ( see also paper i ) ] .",
    "we also include an agn itself , in which the bolometric luminosity is @xmath13 and we simply assume an energy spectrum of @xmath14 between 0.01 ev and 100 kev ( blandford , netzer , & woltjer 1990 ) . to calculate the bolometric luminosity and the energy spectrum of the starburst ring",
    ", we assume the initial mass function ( imf ) to be of salpeter - type , @xmath15 and the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the starburst regions to be @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the elapsed time after the initial starburst .",
    "the total luminosity is regulated by the mass - luminosity relation , @xmath18 , and the mass - age relation , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are respectively stellar mass and stellar luminosity . here",
    ", we consider the mass range of @xmath22 in the imf , since several observations indicate that the imf is deficient in low mass stars with the cutoff of about @xmath23 , and the upper mass limit is inferred to be around @xmath24 ( doyon , puxley , & joseph 1992 ; charlot et al .",
    "1993 ; doane & mathews 1993 ; hill et al .",
    "1994 ; brandl et al .",
    "in addition , we employ the mass - temperature relation , @xmath25 , and the energy spectrum of the star is assumed to be the blackbody spectrum with the effective temperature , @xmath26 .",
    "we neglect the radiation from the supernovae , because the long term - averaged luminosity of supernovae is less than 10% of the total stellar luminosity of the ring as shown in paper i. resultantly , the bolometric luminosity of the starburst ring is in proportion to the total mass , and decreases with time . as for the gravitational fields , we should consider the galactic bulge , the central black hole , and the starburst ring .",
    "but , the gravitational fields in circumnuclear regions suffer from some uncertainty .",
    "recent observations provide significant information which allows us to model the gravitational fields in circumnuclear regions .",
    "for instance , the stellar rotation velocity in the circinus galaxy ( a closest seyfert 2 galaxy ) shows that the mass distributions in circumnuclear regions are not concentrated into a point - like object but extended to a few hundred parsecs ( maiolino et al .",
    "therefore , we consider also such an inner bulge - like component .",
    "we assume the galactic bulge to be an uniform sphere whose mass and radius are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the inner bulge also to be an uniform sphere whose mass and radius are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the mass of the black hole to be @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the observations of iras galaxies by scoville et al .",
    "( 1991 ) show that the central regions within kilo parsecs possess the mass of @xmath32 .",
    "this is comparable to a typical mass of galactic bulge .",
    "a rotation velocity of a starburst ring also implies that the dynamical mass within a few hundred parsecs is several @xmath33 ( elmouttie et al . 1998 ) , which provides an estimation of the mass of inner bulge .",
    "in addition , maiolino et al .",
    "( 1998a ) estimated an upper limit of a putative black hole as several @xmath34 .",
    "( we tentatively assume the black hole of @xmath35 , but the overall results are not changed much even if one assumes @xmath36 or @xmath37 . ) by taking these observational data into account , we adopt the mass ratio as @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "the mass of the starburst ring , @xmath12 , is supposed to be between @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "also , a starforming ring is observed around a few hundred parsecs in some galaxies ( marconi et al . 1994 ; elmouttie et al .",
    "1998 ) . hence",
    ", here we assume a starburst ring at a radius of @xmath41 pc .",
    "for the size ratios , we employ @xmath42 .",
    "the equilibrium configuration of dusty gas is nearly spherically symmetric as shown in the next section .",
    "thus , first we investigate the structure of a radiatively - supported gas wall inside the starburst ring under an approximation of local spherically symmetry . for this purpose",
    ", we assume the gravity by the starburst ring to be constant at a part of the wall of interest .",
    "also , the radiation force by the starburst ring is assumed to to be a function solely of optical depth measured from the outer surface of the wall .",
    "( rigidly speaking , both assumptions are verified only when the wall is geometrically thin and located at the equatorial plane . ) under these assumptions , we solve the one - dimensional radiation - hydrostatic equation , coupled with ionization process and thermal process .",
    "the radiation - hydrostatic equation is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the radius , @xmath45 is the total mass within the radius @xmath44 , @xmath46 is the gas density , @xmath47 is the gas pressure , @xmath48 is the mass extinction coefficient of dusty gas , @xmath49 is the optical depth of the wall measured from the center , @xmath50 is the total optical depth of the wall , and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are respectively the gravity and the radiation flux by the starburst ring .",
    "it is noted that @xmath51 and @xmath52 provide non - spherical components in real situations .",
    "the effects of the non - sphericity are taken into consideration by evaluating these quantities by two - dimensional axisymmetric calculations .",
    "recent observations report the existence of a large amount of dust , molecular gas , and metals in qsos ( barvainis , antonucci , & coleman 1992 ; ohta et al . 1996 ; omont et al . 1996",
    "; dietrich & wilhelm - erkens 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we suppose the dust - to - gas mass ratio to be 0.03 , which is three times as large as that observed in the solar neighborhood . since the mass density of dust and thomson scattering are negligible , the extinction is given by @xmath53 . here , @xmath54 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei",

    "as for the energy balance for dust , the emission from gas is assumed to be absorbed by dust almost on the spot .",
    "then , the energy equation for dust is @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the heating rates for dust due to the direct radiation from a starburst ring as well as an agn and due to the recombination photons from hydrogen , and @xmath109 is the cooling by dust emission .",

    "we note that dust is primarily heated by the direct radiation , so that the dust temperature is not affected heavily even if the heating by the gas emission is dismissed .",
    "moreover , since the absorption cross - section against ir radiation re - emitted from dust is much smaller than that against optical or uv radiation , we suppose that dust grains work as pure absorbers .    the above equations and the equation of state for ideal gas are solved to give the gas density , the gas temperature , the fraction of neutral hydrogen , and the dust temperature as functions of radii .",

    "are assumed .",
    "as seen in this figure , there forms an optically - thick wall , where the inner surface is pushed outward by the radiation force by the agn against the gravity by the inner    bulge and the radiation force by the starburst shoves the wall inward . the optical depth ( @xmath7 ) is basically determined by the ratio of the net radiation force to the total gravity if both agn and starburst are super - eddington respectively to @xmath45 and to @xmath12 .",
    "the density profile of the wall has a peak at @xmath120 pc and the density gradients on both sides of a peak are very steep .",
    "then , the geometrical thickness of the wall is basically determined by the ratio of the square of sound speed to the total radiation force .",
    "the gas temperature is around @xmath121k due to the photoheating . as a result ,",
    "the effective thickness of the wall is less than 10% of its radial extension .",
    "hence , it is concluded that a radiatively - supported wall can be optically thick and geometrically thin .",
    "if the starburst is more luminous , the wall would be thinner because the density gradient would be steeper owing to the radiation force .",
    "on the other hand , if the mass of the starburst ring is less than @xmath122 , the density profile would be roughly the same , since the force fields are mainly determined by the agn and the inner bulge . in this analysis",
    "it has turned out that the radiation force from the agn as well as the starburst is exerted mainly on dust .",
    "therefore , for the mass extinction of the dusty gas , we take only the dust opacity into account in two - dimensional calculations below .",
    "although we have considered the structure of a gas wall inside the starburst ring , the structure of an outer wall beyond the starburst ring can be understood by a similar argument .",
    "if an outer wall forms at several hundred parsecs , the photoheating does not work effectively to raise the temperature @xmath123k , but it becomes around @xmath124k .",
    "then , the thickness of the wall is much thinner than the inner wall . as for the optical depth ( @xmath7 )",
    ", it is determined basically by the ratio of the radiation force to the total gravity for super - eddington luminosity , and therefore could be @xmath9 .",
    "in this section , we examine the equilibrium configuration of a gas wall and the stability in two - dimensional axisymmetric space . we assume the wall to be geometrically thin as analyzed in the previous section . under the assumption , taking the effects by the optical depth into account , we calculate the radiation force and the gravity which are exerted on a dusty wall . the radiative flux force by the starburst ring is given by @xmath125 at a point of @xmath126 in cylindrical coordinates , where @xmath127 denotes @xmath128 or @xmath129 , @xmath130 is the flux mean mass extinction coefficient averaged over the starburst radiation , @xmath131 is the total optical depth of the wall which is estimated with using @xmath130 , @xmath132 is the luminosity density in the starburst ring , @xmath133 is the distance from @xmath134 to a volume element @xmath135 of the ring , @xmath136 is the viewing angle from this element , and @xmath137 is the directional cosine .",
    "similarly , the radiative flux force by the agn is presented by @xmath138 at the same point , where @xmath139 is the flux mean mass extinction averaged over the agn radiation , @xmath44 is the distance , @xmath140 is the viewing angle from the center , and @xmath141 is the total optical depth , which is estimated with using @xmath139 . using equations ( [ force_sb ] ) and ( [ force_agn ] ) ,",
    "the equilibrium between the radiation force and the gravity is determined by @xmath142 in the vertical directions ( @xmath129-directions ) and @xmath143 in the radial directions ( @xmath128-directions ) , where @xmath144 is the effective potential , @xmath145 is the specific angular momentum of the dusty gas and @xmath146 is the gravitational force .",
    "furthermore , stable configuration should satisfy the conditions @xmath147 and @xmath148      first , we consider the formation of a dusty wall inside the starburst ring .",
    "the wall is irradiated outward by the agn and inward by the starburst ring . in figure 2 ,",

    "are assumed . on each curve , the conditions for stable equilibrium in the vertical directions [ ( [ zbalance ] ) and ( [ zstable ] ) ] are satisfied .",
    "however , the dashed curves do not satisfy the force balance ( [ rbalance ] ) in the radial directions , so that the dusty gas is likely to be swung away around the curves because of centrifugal force . as a result",
    ", it is found that the solid curves are the stable equilibrium branches in both vertical and radial directions , which provide the final configuration of the inner obscuring wall .",
    "it is noted that the starburst ring plays an important role for the force balance and the stability of the wall .",
    "the agn as well as the bulge components provides only spherically symmetric forces , whereas the radiation force and the gravity by the starburst ring are not spherically symmetric .",
    "therefore , on the tangential plane , the azimuthal component of centrifugal force can balance only with that of radiation force by the ring ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "to realize this situation , the starburst luminosity is required to be super - eddington , @xmath152 . since the effective radiation force by the starburst ring is weakened for a large viewing angle @xmath136 , the radial balance breaks down in the vicinity of the rotation axis ( z - axis ) .",
    "an opening grows as the optical depth ( @xmath7 ) increases , because of the dilution of the effective radiation force by the ring [ see equation ( [ force_sb ] ) ] . in order that a stable inner wall enshrouds the nuclear regions with a large covering factor ( opening angle @xmath153 )",

    ", the radiation force by a very luminous agn could blow the dusty gas away from the inner bulge regions if the optical depth is not enough to dilute the radiation force .",
    "this provides a lower bound of @xmath7 as @xmath157 because of the time dependence of starburst luminosity , the upper bound of @xmath7 given by inequality ( [ smallav ] ) is a decreasing function of time . for a given model ,",
    "the allowed range of @xmath7 of the inner wall is presented in the figure 4 as a function of time , @xmath17 . in the shaded regions , no    stable equilibrium branches with a large covering factor",

    "that is to say , no inner wall forms regardless of @xmath17 if @xmath158      next , we investigate the formation of an outer wall with the radial extension of @xmath159 . in figure 5 ,",
    "the resultant equilibrium branches of the outer wall are shown in the @xmath128-@xmath129 plane .",
    "as shown in this figure , a nearly spherical wall forms . in this case ,",
    "the starburst ring as well as the agn irradiate the inside of the wall .",
    "therefore , the radiation force by the starburst ring is exerted outward    on the dusty wall , although the inner wall is pushed inward by the starburst radiation .",
    "but , it has been found by the present analyses that the radial equilibrium and stable condition for the outer wall formation is again given by the inequality ( [ smallav ] ) for a wide range of parameters .",
    "it is also required that the starburst ring is super - eddington .",
    "this can be also understood by the argument of force balance in the azimuthal directions at a point on the wall .",
    "the azimuthal component of the centrifugal force can be balanced only by the force by the starburst ring , because only the starburst ring provides a spherical force ( see figure 3 ) .",
    "the upper value of the allowed @xmath7 decreases again with time as the starburst becomes dimmer . as a prerequisite condition for the formation of the wall ,",
    "@xmath160 is required , otherwise the dusty gas is not held at the regions of @xmath161 even in the case of an optically - thin wall . since the radiation force is diluted by the optical depth of the wall , the upper bound of @xmath7 is provided as @xmath162 for the sustainment of the dusty gas . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower bound of @xmath7 is estimated by @xmath163 since the radiation force would blow out the dusty gas in most regions if the @xmath7 of the wall is smaller than this value . comparing this lower limit to equation ( [ smallav ] )",
    ", we find that no outer wall forms if the agn luminosity satisfies the inequality as @xmath164 it is noted that this condition involves the prohibition condition ( [ consmall ] ) for an inner wall .",

    "from a viewpoint of the formation of radiatively - supported obscuring walls , we discuss the connection between the agn type and the starburst events . based upon the conditions of ( [ consmall ] ) and ( [ conlarge ] ) , in figure 6",
    "the prediction for the wall formation is summarized in a diagram of @xmath13 versus @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the mass of a starburst in units of @xmath122 .",

    "however , if the mass supply to an altitude of several 100 pc by a superbubble driven by a circumnuclear starburst is insufficient , no outer wall of @xmath168 several might form ( see next section ) .",
    "the figure shows that for a luminous starburst and a relatively faint agn , both inner and outer walls are built up , and    the nucleus could be obscured with the total extinction of @xmath2 .",
    "then , the nucleus is likely to be identified as a type 2 agn ( sy 2 ) .",
    "also , the outer wall may be consistent with the recently observed obscuring material extending up to @xmath8 pc around the nuclei ( rudy , cohen , & ake 1988 ; miller , goodrich , & mathews 1991 ; goodrich 1995 ; mcleod & rieke 1995a ; maiolino et al .",

    "such a difference between @xmath7 estimated by the x - ray observations and @xmath7 assessed by the ir or optical observations might be due to obscuring matter free from dust , located just inside the dust sublimation radius of subparsec .",
    "the structure and formation mechanism of obscuring material in subparsec regions is debatable , but it is beyond the scope of this paper .    if a starburst is intrinsically faint , neither an outer wall nor inner one is expected to form .",
    "then , the nucleus could be observed as a type 1 agn ( sy 1 ) .",
    "these results provide a physical explanation for the putative correlation between agn type and host properties whereby seyfert 2 galaxies are more frequently associated with circumnuclear starbursts than type 1 galaxies . in the cases of the moderate extinction by the walls may lead to intermediate types of agns , that is , type 1.9 , 1.8 , 1.5 , or 1.2 according to the decrease of the extinction .",
    "in addition , we have come to a significant conclusion that a much higher agn activity as ( [ conlarge ] ) would preclude either wall from forming .",
    "then the nucleus tends to be identified as type 1 regardless of the starburst luminosity .",
    "this result may be closely related to the fact that qsos are mostly observed as type 1 regardless of star - forming activity in the host galaxies .",
    "in the previous section , it is shown that the obscuring walls form in the case of the luminous starburst and the relatively faint agn .",
    "it implies that the obscuration of the agn is time - dependent , since the bolometric luminosity of the starburst ring decreases with time due to stellar evolution . in this section",
    ", we discuss the evolution of the agn type predicted by this picture .",
    "the schematic view of the evolution of circumnuclear structure is shown in figure 7 . in an early evolutionary stage ,",
    "a large amount of dusty gas could be blown out by superbubbles in the circumnuclear starburst regions .",
    "shapiro & field ( 1976 ) , tomisaka & ikeuchi ( 1986 ) , and norman & ikeuchi ( 1989 ) have shown that a superbubble of @xmath171 1kpc powered by massive ob associations forms . as an observational example , the superbubble of 1.1kpc is observed in the immediately east of the nucleus of nearby seyfert 2/liner galaxy ngc3079 ( veilleux et al . 1994 ) .    also , if the mass supply rate given by norman & ikeuchi ( 1989 ) is applied to the case of circumnuclear starbursts of @xmath172 , the rate into the regions of several 100 pc height from the circumnuclear molecular disk due to superbubbles is estimated as several @xmath173 . in the case of the superbubble of the ngc3079 , duric & seaquist ( 1988 ) and veilleux et al .",
    "( 1994 ) evaluated the mass supply rate to be @xmath174 and @xmath175 , respectively .",
    "as a    result , the dusty gas of @xmath176 would be supplied within a typical lifetime of a superbubble ( @xmath177 yr ) and composes the obscuring walls in the next stage .",
    "however , an outer obscuring wall with @xmath168 10 may not form , because it requires the dusty gas of @xmath178 . on the other hand ,",
    "the required mass for an inner wall is merely @xmath179 .",
    "the formation timescales of an inner wall and that of an outer wall are several @xmath180 yr and several @xmath181 yr , respectively .",
    "both timescales are shorter than the evolutionary timescale of the starburst on the order of @xmath177 yr .",
    "thus , the nucleus is likely to be obscured by the inner wall with @xmath168 several as well as the outer wall with @xmath182 a few , whereas the possible @xmath7 decreases with time due to the stellar evolution in the starburst regions .",
    "based on the present stellar evolution model , the nucleus is heavily obscured and tends to be observed as type 2 agn ( sy 2 ) within several @xmath183 yr .",
    "also , the inner wall would not be destroyed even if the superbubbles occur in this stage , since the bubble diameter on the equatorial plane is comparable to the scale height of the molecular disk ( schiano 1985 ; mac low & mccray 1988 ; tomisaka & ikeuchi 1988 ; mac low , mccray , & norman 1989 ) .    in the final stage ,",
    "the obscuring walls disappear due to the diminution of the bolometric luminosity of the circumnuclear starburst .",
    "then , the nucleus would be identified as type 1 agn ( sy 1 ) .",
    "to conclude , the agn type is time - dependent and is destined to shift from type 2 to type 1 in several times @xmath4 yr .",
    "it is stressed that no obscuring wall forms in the case of the luminous agn like qsos so that type of qso does not vary , and which is observed as type 1 regardless of the age of the starburst .",
    "here we have assumed that agn activity and the circumnuclear starbursts are simultaneous events . from an observational point of view , it seems to be reasonable , because it is revealed that agn events are frequently accompanied by starbursts in a variety of data ( scoville et al .",
    "1986 ; soifer et al . 1986",
    "; heckman et al . 1989 , 1995 ; marconi et al . 1994 ; neff et al . 1994 ; cid fernandes & terlevich 1995 ; genzel et al .",
    "1995 ; maiolino et al .",

    "; rodriguez - espinosa , rudy & jones 1987 ; elmouttie et al .",
    "1998 ; cid fernandes , storchi - bergmann , & schmitt 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , as a physical solution which links the two events , norman & scoville ( 1988 ) have suggested a model , whereby the interstellar medium which is released by post - main - sequence stars in starburst regions feeds a central black hole .",
    "also , the radiatively driven mass accretion onto a black hole due to the radiation drag , which is proposed by umemura , fukue , & mineshige ( 1997 , 1998 ) , fukue , umemura , & mineshige ( 1997 ) , and ohsuga et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , would link the two events .    in the present analysis , we have assumed the interstellar gas containing a large amount of dust which is inferred in qsos ( barvainis , antonucci , & coleman 1992 ; ohta et al .",
    "1996 ; omont et al . 1996",
    "; dietrich & wilhelm - erkens 2000 ) .",
    "however , the dust grains could be destroyed in shock - heated hot gas and they could be reproduced in cooled superbubble winds .",
    "the dust properties around agns are under debate also from an observational point of view .",
    "the destruction , formation , and growth of the dust grains would make obviously significant effects not only in the present picture but also in a generic problem of obscuration .",
    "thus , this issue should be considered more carefully in the future analysis .",
    "finally , we discuss the stabilities of the obscuring walls .",
    "first of all , the walls are unlikely to be subject to the rayleigh - taylor instability .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , the density gradient of the inner wall is positive inside the density peak and negative outside the peak .",
    "as shown in figure 3 , the acceleration works in the same directions as the density gradient in both sides .",
    "thus , the rayleigh - taylor instability does not occur at the inner wall . in the case of the outer wall ,",
    "the radiation force by the agn and the starburst ring , which pushes up the wall , is the dominant force at the inner surface , but the dusty gas is attracted by the gravity at the outer surface . as a result , both walls turn out to be stable to the rayleigh - taylor mode . however , the walls might be subject to the other instabilities . when the density perturbations occur in the walls , the thick parts of the walls",
    "go down by the gravity , whereas the radiation force lifts the less thick parts , since the radiation force is ineffective for heavily optically - thick parts .",
    "then , the walls are likely to have more complicated configurations . moreover",
    ", thermal instabilities might break out , because the radiative cooling works at the dense regions effectively , whereas the gas remains as warm as @xmath123 k in the optically thin regions due to radiative heating .",
    "simultaneously , the self - gravitating instability might grow at the cool and dense parts of the walls .",
    "also , the actual circumnuclear starburst is not perfectly ring - shaped but more or less clumpy and therefore makes non - axisymmetric radiation fields , although the wheel effects by the rotation could smear out non - axisymmetric effects to some degree ( see also ohsuga & umemura 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , the dusty walls are possibly damaged due to the collision of starburst winds or dusty gas expelled from mass losing stars inside the walls .",
    "consequently , the walls could be distorted and fragment into small pieces .",
    "how the gas clouds resulting from the fragmentation obscure the agn is an interesting issue , but the details are not clear before radiation - hydrodynamical simulations are performed .",
    "in the present analysis , by taking optical depth due to dust opacity into consideration , we have analyzed the stable equilibrium configuration of dusty gas in the circumnuclear regions in radiation fields by a starburst and an agn .",
    "it has been found that the radiation pressure by a circumnuclear starburst sustains an inner obscuring wall of several ten parsecs and an outer obscuring wall of several hundred parsecs .",
    "the total extinction of the obscuring walls has turned out to be around ten .",
    "then , the nucleus would be identified as type 2 .",
    "if a starburst is intrinsically faint or becomes dimmer owing to the stellar evolution there , neither an outer wall nor inner one would not form . then",
    ", the nucleus could be observed as a type 1 agn ( sy 1 ) .",
    "the results on outer and inner walls share a certain similarity in that the strong radiation force by the agn prevents the formation of an outer wall as well as an inner wall .",
    "these results provide a physical explanation for the correlation between agn type and host properties , whereby seyfert type 2 galaxies are more frequently associated with circumnuclear starbursts than type 1 galaxies , whereas qsos are mostly observed as type 1 even though vigorous star - forming activities are often observed in the host galaxies .",
    "also , the large - scale outer wall of several hundred parsecs is consistent with the observations on obscuring material extending up to @xmath8 pc around the nuclei .",
    "finally , this model predicts the time evolution of the agn type from type 2 to type 1 in several times @xmath4 yr as a circumnuclear starburst becomes dimmer due to stellar evolution .",
