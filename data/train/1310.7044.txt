    "glancing heavy ion collisions exchange strong photon fluxes with intensities driven by the charge of ions and the distance between then .",
    "this interactions turn heavy ion colliders into laboratories to study photo - production of vector meson @xcite as well as photon - photon colliders @xcite . these ultra - peripheral collisions ( upc ) need to be discriminated from the more abundant hadronic interaction events where the ions get close enough ( @xmath0 where b is the impact parameter defined a the distance between nuclei centers ) and produce abundant number of charged particles .",
    "such discrimination requires special triggers which at rhic and the lhc include rapidity gaps and low multiplicity in the rapidity region of interest .",
    "beam backgrounds and very peripheral hadronic interactions can reduce the efficiency of these triggers .",
    "both phenix and star have complemented their upc triggers using signal from neutrons showering in hadronic zero degrees calorimeters ( zdc ) placed at zero degrees with respect to the beam direction at interaction points .",
    "the interaction between a photon and the other ion is well described as the photon fluctuates into a vector meson which then scatters off the other ion",
    ". the scattering can be coherent where the probe sees the target as a single object or incoherent where the scattering happens at the level of individual nucleons .",
    "the transverse momentum of the scattered vector mesons is a good discriminator between these two interactions as the coherent scatterings accumulate at low transverse momentum , while the incoherent ones have a broad @xmath1 distribution .",
    "the phenix collaboration has focused in the detection of the j/@xmath2 meson both at mid and high rapidity making use of its electromagnetic calorimeters , ring imaging detectors and the muon arms to select events with electron or muon pairs .",
    "the star upc program focused on the lower mass @xmath3 mesons but with its bigger data sets is now able to extract a robust j/@xmath2 signal .",
    "phenix has analyzed data collected in the years 2007 and 2010 from au+au interactions at @xmath4=200 gev .",
    "the 2007 data focuses on j/@xmath2 mesons produced at mid - rapidity that decay into @xmath5 pairs detected in the central arms .",
    "those events include as well the emission of at least one beam neutron which is detected in any of the zdc detectors . figure [ phenixjpsi ] shows the background subtracted invariant mass distribution of electron pairs where the j/@xmath2 meson peak is clearly visible over the di - electron continuum .",
    "the events shown in that figure have the transverse momentum of the electron pair forming a well defined peak below @xmath6 mev / c , a clear indication that they scattered off the entire au nucleus .",
    "the cross section extracted from the measurement performed during the 2004 au+au run is equal to @xmath7 .",

    "gev a data set of 30 m events was collected with two triggers .",
    "both have rapidity gaps of similar widths on both sides but they differ on the conditions at mid - rapidity . the so called upc_topo trigger uses the azimuthal information from elements that fired in the time of flight ( tof ) detector to select back - to - back tracks .",
    "the second trigger called upc_main demands a minimum and a maximum number of hits in the tof detector ( @xmath11 tof hits @xmath12 ) and requires signal on the zdc detectors equivalent to @xmath13 beam neutrons @xmath12 .",
    "the analyses presented in this report have been done with events that fire this second trigger .",
    "events with only two tracks originating from the vertex are selected . both tracks in those pairs have to satisfy quality cuts and be identified as pions : the amount of ionization energy loss in the tpc gas along the track must be within 3 standard deviations away from the calculated value .",
    "the invariant mass of pair candidates with tracks having opposite charge are generated and pairs with masses between 0.500 and 1 gev are selected as @xmath3 mesons .",
    "it is estimated that most of the background in this measurement comes from very peripheral hadronic interaction as the au ions start to overlap . for these events with at most two tracks ,",
    "the best estimator of the background and its relevant distributions is obtained by generating them with pairs of equal charge . having those equal sign distribution",
    "the background is statistically subtracted . the coherent scattering off a nucleus",
    "is mainly concentrated at small angles ( measured with respect to the photon direction which is mostly parallel to the ion beams .",
    "the incoherent component is much harder and has a power law shape .",
