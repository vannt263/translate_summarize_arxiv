    "since the discovery of the first extra - solar planet by doppler velocity techniques in 1994 by @xcite , planetary detections have been dominated by northern hemisphere search programmes  most prolifically by the precision velocity programmes at lick ( e.g. @xcite ) and keck ( e.g. @xcite ) , but also complemented by lower precision programmes at ohp @xcite , mcdonald observatory @xcite , afoe @xcite , and programmes at la silla @xcite . of these programmes , only the latter have access to the sky south of @xmath5 , and these achieve precisions of @xmath610ms@xmath0 . in 1998 , therefore , the anglo - australian planet search was begun to complete the all - sky coverage of the brightest stars at precisions reaching 3ms@xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we present some first results from this programme . a companion paper ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) presents results for a further two new planets , along with a detailed description of our observational programme .",
    "the anglo - australian planet search is being carried out on the 3.92 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) , using the university college of london echelle spectrograph ( ucles ) and an i@xmath7 absorption cell .",
    "ucles is operated in its 31linesmm@xmath0 mode with an mit / ll 2048@xmath84096 15@xmath9 m pixel ccd .",
    "this lumogen - coated ccd ( denoted mitll2 ) underwent a serious failure at the end of 1999 , which required its read - out to be switched to the second of its working amplifiers in 2000 january ( following which it was denoted mitll2a ) . no change in the operation of the detector",
    "( apart from a flipped read - out format ) has been detected by our programme .",
    "our target sample of @xmath10200 stars with @xmath11 , includes f , g and k v - iv stars with v@xmath127.5 and mv stars with v@xmath1211.5 .",
    "where age / activity information is available from s or @xmath13 indices ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , target stars are required to have ages greater than 3gyr .",
    "our first observing run was in 1998 january , and the last run for which observations are reported here was in 2000 november .",
    "the observing and data processing procedure follows that described in @xcite , and is described in detail in paper ii . in particular , paper ii presents velocities for a number of stable stars illustrating that we reach a velocity precision floor of 3ms@xmath0  for the bright stars included in our programme .",
    "one of the stars presented here ( hd179949 ) has also had confirmatory observations acquired at three epochs in 2000 september 5 - 8 , as part of the keck planet search @xcite .",
    "hd179949 ( hr7291 , hip94645 , gj749 ) is an f8v star , which shows moderate rotation with a measured @xmath14 = 6.3@xmath150.9kms@xmath0@xcite .",
    "its hipparcos parallax puts it at 27.0@xmath150.5pc , with m@xmath16=4.09@xmath150.04 @xcite .",
    "there is no published evidence to indicate that hd179949 is a binary .",
    "the photometry of @xcite indicates hd179949 has roughly solar metallicity with [ fe / h]=+0.02@xmath150.1 .",
    "the @xmath17 calibration of @xcite and published photometry would indicate a more metal - rich [ fe / h]=+0.22@xmath150.07 .",
    "the latter is supported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "8) which indicates hd179949 is as metal - rich , if not more so , than the majority of disk main - sequence stars .",
    "hd179949 has a moderate x - ray luminosity as determined by rosat s pspc  @xcite determine a l@xmath18=41.0@xmath810@xmath19 ergs@xmath0 , while in an independent analysis @xcite determine l@xmath18/l@xmath20=(9.7@xmath153.3)@xmath810@xmath21 .",
    "both are some 10 times higher than the equivalent quantity in the quiet sun .",
    "the spectra acquired at keck have been used to derive a @xmath22 index of -4.72 for this star , using the same procedure as @xcite .",
    "figure [ hd179949_hline ] compares the h line with that seen in the sun .",
    "the mass of hd179949 is estimated to be 1.24@xmath150.1m@xmath4 , based on interpolation between evolutionary tracks of @xcite .",
    "hd164427 ( hip88531 , gl700a ) is an inactive g0v @xcite star , with a @xmath22 index of -4.95 @xcite .",
    "its hipparcos parallax puts it at a distance of 39.1@xmath151.4pc , and m@xmath16=3.91@xmath150.8 @xcite making it somewhat over - luminous for its spectral type .",
    "indeed @xcite classified it as a sub - giant , with luminosity class iv .",
    "the @xmath23 calibration of @xcite suggests a metallicity of [ fe / h]=+0.11@xmath150.07 .",
    "hd164427 was catalogued as a very wide binary ( gl700ab ) by @xcite ( though both have since dropped out of the nearby star sample @xcite due to better parallaxes placing them outside the 25pc limit ) .",
    "the binary identification is actually due to luyten ( 1957 ) who catalogued this pair as ltt7172 and ltt7173 ( respectively ) with common proper motion and a 28  separation at a position angle of 336 .",
    "there is no subsequent astrometry of this pair in the literature .",
    "examination of digital sky survey scans of a ukst plate from 1992.6 shows no evidence for an object with the magnitude difference indicated by luyten ( @xmath24 ) at this separation relative to hd164427 , leading us to conclude it may not be a common proper motion pair .",
    "even if the system were a binary , it would be a very wide system ( 1090au )  so wide as to be irrelevant for the purposes of high precision doppler velocities .",
    "the mass of hd164427 is estimated to be 1.05@xmath150.1m@xmath4 .",
    "both stars were seen to be photometrically stable over the life of the hipparcos mission at a 95% confidence level of @xmath120.015 magnitudes @xcite .",
    "twenty  three observations of hd179949 are listed in table [ vel179949 ] , where the column labelled `` uncert . ''",
    "is the velocity uncertainty produced by the least - squares fitting process , which simultaneously determines the doppler shift and the spectrograph point - spread function ( psf ) , given an iodine absorption spectrum , an `` iodine free '' template spectrum of the object , and an `` iodine '' spectrum of the object @xcite .",
    "this uncertainty includes the effects of photon - counting uncertainties , residual errors in the spectrograph psf model and variation in the underlying spectrum between the template and `` iodine '' epochs .",
    "only observations where the uncertainty is less than twice the median uncertainty are listed .",
    "these data are shown in figure [ hd179949_rv_curve ] phased with a period of 3.093 days .",
    "the figure shows the best - fit keplerian model for the data , with the resultant orbital parameters listed in table [ orbits ] .",
    "fit period from keplerian fitting is the same as the period found from the peak of the scargle periodogram , with a false alarm probability less than 0.001 . both aat ( dots ) and keck ( squares ) data are shown , with the keck data completely confirming the orbital fits derived from the aat data alone . like the previously observed giant planets in 3 to 5 day orbits",
    ", hd179949 appears to be in a circular orbit .",
    "table [ orbits ] includes the best ",
    "fit orbital solutions both for the case of a circular orbit and floating eccentricity .",
    "the resulting minimum companion mass is 0.84m@xmath2 , with an orbital semi - major axis of 0.045au .",
    "the residuals about the fit are at the level of `` jitter '' expected in an f8v star with hd179949 s level of rotation ( 6.3kms@xmath0 ) and activity ( @xmath22=@xmath25 ) .",
    "`` jitter '' here is used to refer to the scatter in the observed velocity about a mean vaue in systems observed over the long - term to have no keplerian doppler shifts .",
    "it is thought to be the combined effect of surface inhomogeneties , stellar activity and stellar rotation .",
    "@xcite have studied the correlations between `` jitter '' , and stellar rotation and activity in the lick precision velocity programme .",
    "they indicate we would expect hd179949 to show @xmath1010ms@xmath0  `` jitter '' due to activity , spots , etc .",
    "we measure a scatter of 10ms@xmath0  about our keplerian fit , which is consistent with this expectation .",
    "the twenty - seven observations of hd166427 are listed in table [ vel164427 ] , and they are shown in figure [ hd164427_rv_curve ] along with a keplerian fit to the data with the orbital parameters listed in table [ orbits ] .",
    "the rms scatter about this fit is 7.7ms@xmath0 , slightly larger than the median uncertainty from the fitting process of 5.6 ms@xmath0 .",
    "this is larger than the systematic precision limit of the anglo - australian planet search , as the earliest observations of this object were performed in very poor conditions .",
    "as soon as it was realised hd164427 was a velocity variable with large amplitude , it was `` pro - rated '' within the programme to only short exposures ( and so lower precision than the rest of the programme ) , though still more than sufficient to precisely determine the companion s orbit .",
    "the resultant minimum companion mass is 46m@xmath2 , or 0.043m@xmath4 , and the orbital semi - major axis is 0.46au .",
    "ten other `` 51 peg''-like planets are currently known with periods under 10 days , and eccentricities less than 0.1andb , @xmath26boo to be `` 51peg''-like , as well as 51peg itself . ] .",
    "the minimum masses of these planets span the range 0.24 - 3.87m@xmath2 , with orbital semi - major axes in the range 0.038 - 0.059au . in all respects ,",
    "hd179949 falls squarely into this class of objects .",
    "even its above - solar metallicity is similar to that seen in the other `` 51peg''-like planets ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .      as with all the other `` 51peg''-like planets",
    ", hd179949 is an excellent candidate for a transit search . the hipparcos magnitude , color index , and parallax of the star imply a radius of about 1.24 r@xmath4 , which , combined with the orbital radius of 0.045 au , places the probability of observable transits at 12.8% .",
    "successful transit observations ( already carried out for hd209458 by @xcite and @xcite ) not only tightly constrain orbital inclination , but provide planetary radii as well .    to search for transits in hd179949 , we obtained photometric observations between 2000 september 21 and october 1 with the t8 0.80 m automatic photoelectric telescope ( apt ) at fairborn observatory in southern arizona .",
    "the instrumentation and techniques used for this transit search are described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the observations were made differentially with respect to the comparison star hd178075 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , b9.5v ) .",
    "the precision of an individual observation is approximately 0.004mag , somewhat worse than the typical precision of 0.001mag obtainable with the apt due to observations being at air masses between two and three .",
    "no transit events were detected at the times predicted by the orbital parameters of table [ orbits ] .",
    "for an assumed planetary radius of 1.4r@xmath2(the measured radius of the planetary companion of hd209458 @xcite ) , the predicted transit depth is 0.014mag .",
    "the mean of our 16 photometric observations of hd179949 taken within the predicted transit window is 0.1058 @xmath15 0.0010mag ; the mean of the 38 observations outside the transit window is 0.1044 @xmath15 0.0007mag .",
    "thus , the two means agree within their respective errors and transits deeper than about 0.001mag are ruled out .",
    "this non - detection of transits limits the orbital inclination @xmath29 to less than 83 , and @xmath30 to less than 0.992 .",
    "furthermore , the photometric observations place a limit of about 0.001mag on any photometric variability of hd179949 on the radial velocity period .",
    "this confirms that neither starspots nor stellar pulsations can be the cause of the radial velocity variations ( see @xcite ) and so strongly supports the existence of the planet even in the absense of transits .",
    "recent work on the mass function of brown dwarfs in star clusters @xcite has failed to show that star formation processes can not form objects below the 13m@xmath2  deuterium burning limit .",
    "( though the same results can be interpreted - less straightforwardly - as implying the existence of free - floating sub-13m@xmath2  objects formed by dynamical evolution ejecting objects formed by planetary processes . ) certainly they provide no evidence that the deuterium burning limit is a useful demarcation boundary between star- and planet - formation processes .",
    "difficult as it may be , only an understanding of formation mechanisms ( and possible subsequent dynamical evolution ) can allow us to determine whether objects in the 5 - 20m@xmath2  range are planets or brown dwarfs .",
    "nonetheless , the minimum mass of the companion to hd164427 clearly lies in a range unlikely to be due to planetary formation processes  it is a brown dwarf or a star , not a planet .",
    "hipparcos astrometry , however , allows us to place some limits on the orbital inclination and mass for hd164427 s companion .",
    "the astrometric solution for hd164427 shows a good fit for the parallax and proper motion of a single star , with 1-@xmath31 residuals of @xmath103mas .",
    "the uncertainty on the derived parallax is 0.9mas .",
    "based on this we can assume an upper limit to the astrometric perturbation ( @xmath32 ) of hd164427 due to an unseen companion of @xmath33mas .",
    "then from the relationship between the spectroscopic and astrometric orbital elements ( e.g. @xcite , equation 1 ) we conclude that @xmath34 , or equivalently that the companion mass is less than 190m@xmath2  or 0.18m@xmath4 , making it either a brown dwarf , or a very low - mass star . with an orbital semi - major axis of 0.46au at 39pc ,",
    "such a companion will have an maximum apparent separation of 11.8mas .",
    "table [ companion_mag ] compares the absolute k magnitudes of hd164427 , with predicted magnitudes of the companion in the range of allowed masses . only at the very massive end of this range",
    "is the companion likely to be detectable by either ground - based adaptive optics or space - based imaging .",
    "nonetheless , such a challenging observation must be pursued .",
    "of the small number of brown dwarf candidates identified by precision doppler surveys to date ( around 11 ) , many have been shown to actually be stars @xcite , making _",
    "bona fide _ brown dwarf companions rare , and well worth unambiguously identifying .",
    "we present first results from the anglo - australian planet search , which is now the highest precision doppler planet search in the southern hemisphere .",
    "these include a new member of the `` 51peg''-like class of planets around the f8 dwarf hd179949 , and a new brown dwarf candidate companion to the g0 dwarf hd164427 .",
    "this programme has now been running on the aat for over 2 years and has demonstrated velocity precisions reaching 3ms@xmath0 .",
    "we confidently expect many more discoveries in the years to come  particularly as it extends its sensitivity toward the jupiter - like planet regime .",
    "the anglo - australian planet search team would like to gratefully acknowledge the support of the director of the aao , dr brian boyle , and the superb technical support which has been received throughout the programme from aat staff - in particular e.penny , r.patterson , d.stafford , f.freeman , s.lee , j.pogson and g.schafer .",
