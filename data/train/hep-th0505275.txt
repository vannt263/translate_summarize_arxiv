    "many current problems in particle physics as well as statistical physics demand for new nonperturbative field theoretic techniques .",
    "particularly , the treatment of strongly coupled fluctuations requires methods that go beyond standard perturbative techniques .",
    "conventionally , perturbation theory is understood as an expansion for both small coupling and small amplitude of the fields .",
    "the case of larger fields but small coupling can be addressed with effective - action techniques that take the coupling to all orders to an external field into account ; prominent examples are the heisenberg - euler effective action @xcite or the coleman - weinberg effective potential @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose a technique that has the potential to deal with the opposite limit : arbitrary coupling but weak external - field amplitude .",
    "the technique is based on the worldline formulation of quantum field theory that goes back to ideas of feynman @xcite ; it can be viewed as a mapping of field theoretic problems onto quantum mechanical path integrals , identifying the trajectory of a fluctuation in coordinate space with the path of a quantum mechanical particle .",
    "the approach had occurred rarely in the literature , see , e.g. , @xcite , until it was realized that certain perturbative computations simplify tremendously in the worldline approach @xcite ; the deep reason behind this observation is the fact , that the worldline formulation of field theoretic correlators can be understood as the infinite string - tension limit of string - theory amplitudes , giving rise to a higher level of organization of the expressions .",
    "important progress was made by generalizing the worldline techniques to effective - action computations @xcite . by now , the formalism has found a wide range of application , see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "the power of the worldline approach became particularly apparent in combination with numerical monte - carlo techniques @xcite ; _ worldline numerics _ in the form of efficient and fast algorithms is now available for the computation of effective actions or casimir energies for highly general forms of the external field . for instance , nonlocal phenomena and fluctuation - induced geometry - dependent interactions can now be computed reliably and straightforwardly @xcite .",
    "the majority of applications of the worldline approach remains perturbative in the coupling , even though formal all - order expressions can already be found in the early works @xcite .",
    "the present work aims at exploiting these and related formal expressions for a direct evaluation of all - order results by numerical monte - carlo means .",
    "we demonstrate the potential of worldline numerics for nonperturbative problems with the aid of a super - renormalizable model field theory involving a `` charged '' real scalar field @xmath2 coupled to a `` scalar photon '' @xmath3 . promoting the @xmath2 field formally to an @xmath0-component field ,",
    "we study the system by means of an expansion for small @xmath0 .",
    "already at leading nontrivial order , this expansion corresponds to an infinite set of feynman diagrams involving one open @xmath2 line or , alternatively , one closed @xmath2 loop but arbitrarily many scalar photon fluctuations .",
    "we refer to the leading nontrivial order as the `` quenched approximation '' .",
    "this approximation holds for arbitrarily large values of the coupling .",
    "although it also includes infinitely many couplings to the external field , we expect that the approximation is most reliable for weak field amplitudes . as a first concrete application",
    ", we compute the nonperturbative effective action for the scalar photon , @xmath4 $ ] , in the quenched approximation , concentrating on the induced interactions of soft photons . in this way",
    ", we obtain an effective action of heisenberg - euler type to leading order in @xmath0 but to all orders in the coupling .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to demonstrate that our method is capable of giving answers to nonperturbative problems with a computation from first principles . with regard to more realistic quantum field theories",
    ", our work serves as a feasibility study . nevertheless , even in the simple model we observe new phenomena that may generalize to other theories as well",
    "of special relevance is the following result : whereas the perturbative expansion is ill - defined for a massless @xmath2 field ( similar , e.g. , to massless qed ) , the nonperturbative effective action remains valid for massless fields , revealing the unexpected breakdown of perturbation theory ( and not of the theory itself ) in this limit .",
    "our work is related to other nonperturbative investigations of field theoretic problems based on the worldline approach : in @xcite , scalar qed ( scqed ) in quenched approximation was considered , and an instanton approximation of the path integral was used to compute all - order corrections to the schwinger pair - production rate in a constant electric field .",
    "furthermore , a comprehensive study of the worldline expressions for various quenched propagators has been performed in @xcite , employing a variational approach .",
    "therein , the nonperturbatively interacting path integrals are approximated by optimizing a trial action according to a variational principle . in @xcite ,",
    "the worldline approach was used to deduce information about the nonperturbative quenched propagator beyond the well - controlled infrared ( ir ) limit . a combination of monte - carlo techniques with the worldline approach has also been used in @xcite for the determination of bound - state properties from 4-point correlators ;",
    "see also @xcite for an approach to qcd bound states .",
    "moreover , non perturbative worldline methods have been used to calculate the chiral anomalies @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we start the presentation of our work in sect .",

    "let us consider a specific euclidean quantum field theoretic model in @xmath5 dimensional spacetime involving two interacting real scalar fields @xmath2 and @xmath3 with bare lagrangian @xmath6 this model meets our requirements in many respects : ( i ) it has a well - defined perturbative expansion , ( ii ) it will turn out to have also a well - defined nonperturbative expansion in the quenched approximation , ( iii ) the interaction @xmath7 is super - renormalizable in @xmath8 , since the coupling has positive mass dimension @xmath9=1 $ ] , and hence facilitates a simple analysis of the ( nonperturbative ) divergencies , ( iv ) the imaginary interaction imitates the interaction occurring in qed with @xmath3 being the scalar analogue of the massless photon field ; hence , @xmath3 will be called the `` scalar photon '' in the following .",
