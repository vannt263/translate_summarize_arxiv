    "the main goals in the physics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions are not only the discovery of a new state of deconfined nuclear matter , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , but also the investigation of thermodynamical aspects of its new phase , i.e. , the equation of state ( eos ) , the order of phase transition between the qgp phase and the hadron phase , or the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic model is appropriate for this purpose since thermodynamical variables such as temperature , energy density , and pressure are basic ingredients of the model .",
    "hydrodynamics is directly connected with the eos of nuclear matter , thereby we describe the phase transition phenomena in a straightforward manner in terms of hydrodynamics ; on the other hand , it is somewhat difficult to discuss the confinement - deconfinement phase transition by microscopic kinetic theories .",
    "therefore , if hydrodynamics is applicable to the description of space - time evolution of nuclear matter , it has some advantages over microscopic kinetic theories when we investigate the thermodynamics of the qgp .",
    "in addition , the hydrodynamic model enables us to analyze the collective flow of nuclear matter produced in heavy - ion collisions . in the central pb + pb collisions at 158 @xmath0 gev at the cern super proton synchrotron ( sps ) , the inverse slope parameters of the transverse mass spectra for the non - multistrange hadrons @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 are parametrized by the two common values , the freeze - out temperature and the radial velocity @xcite .",
    "this implies that these particles constitute the radial flow , and that the local thermalization among those particles is achieved in _ central _ collisions .",
    "the experimental results suggest the hydrodynamic description for the expansion of nuclear matter seems to be suitable in central collisions at the sps energy . on the other hand",
    ", it is an open question whether the hydrodynamic picture is valid even in _ non - central _ collisions .    as well as",
    "central heavy - ion collisions , non - central events contain many attractive phenomena ; these are important in understanding the phase transition between the qgp phase and the hadron phase . from the hydrodynamic point of view , there are two interesting topics in non - central collisions .",
    "one is the elliptic flow , which is one of the anisotropic collective flows on the transverse plane .",
    "fourier analysis of azimuthal distribution for measured particles is often used to discuss the anisotropic transverse flow quantitatively @xcite .",
    "the first and the second fourier coefficients stand for the directed and the elliptic flow respectively .",
    "ollitrault showed that the elliptic anisotropy is largely affected by the eos of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "sorge also showed that elliptic flow is highly sensitive to pressure at the early stage of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "heiselberg and levy discussed that the centrality dependence of elliptic flow may have an unusual structure when the matter at the early stage crosses the phase transition region as varying the impact parameter @xcite .",
    "voloshin and poskanzer showed that the centrality dependence of elliptic flow is a good indicator for the thermalization of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the elliptic flow was observed at cern sps @xcite .",
    "the na49 collaboration found that the second fourier coefficient of azimuthal distribution for charged pions is about 4 % around the midrapidity and the low transverse momentum @xcite .",
    "the wa98 collaboration also obtained a similar result for positive pions .",
    "in addition to this result , they observed a remarkable phenomenon for positive kaons ; only positive kaons are emitted out of the reaction plane at the sps energy @xcite .",
    "the other topic in non - central collisions is the  nutcrack \" phenomenon advocated by teaney and shuryak @xcite . according to their results",
    ", the unusual structure of nuclear matter can appear if the qcd phase transition occurs in non - central collisions at relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) energies .",
    "along the lines of these works , kolb _ et al .",
    "_  studied these two topics by using hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies mentioned above are , however , all based on the ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional hydrodynamic model @xcite or on microscopic kinetic theories @xcite",
    ". therefore , full ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional hydrodynamic simulations are indispensable for a comprehensive understanding of the expansion stage of heavy - ion collisions and the phase transition of nuclear matter in the full phase space . here",
    "we study non - central heavy - ion collisions by using a fully three - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic model . in this paper",
    ", we compare the numerical results of the rapidity distribution with the experimental data in non - central collisions at the sps energy , before discussing each topic mentioned above .",
    "this work is the first analysis by means of a full ( 3 + 1 ) dimensional hydrodynamic model . from a hydrodynamic standpoint",
    ", it is very important to choose the initial condition to reproduce the single particle spectra of hadrons since the predictive power of hydrodynamics is rather limited .",
    "the hydrodynamic analyses of flow , dilepton spectra , hbt , and so on , are really meaningful only after tuning the hydrodynamic model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ rhm ] , we briefly review the relativistic hydrodynamic model .",
    "the relativistic hydrodynamic equations with a relevant eos are introduced in this section .",
    "we also discuss the initial condition of the hydrodynamic model to describe the non - central heavy - ion collisions . in sec .",
    "[ pd ] , we show how to calculate the particle distribution within the hydrodynamic model . in particular , we focus on the contribution from resonance decays to the particle spectra . in sec .",
    "[ hs ] , we show the numerical results of hadron spectra in central and non - central collisions .",
    "we examine in this section whether the ansatz of wounded nucleon scaling , which is widely used in the two - dimensional hydrodynamic model @xcite , is really valid for the initial condition .",
    "our results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sd ] . in the appendix",
    ", we briefly show how to obtain the contribution from resonance decays by using a monte carlo method .",
    "assuming local thermal equilibrium for nuclear matter produced in heavy - ion collisions , we describe its space - time evolution by a relativistic hydrodynamic model .",
    "relativistic hydrodynamic equations for a perfect fluid represent energy and momentum conservations @xmath5u^\\mu(x ) u^\\nu(x)-p(x ) g^{\\mu \\nu},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and baryon density conservation @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are , respectively , energy density , pressure , baryon density , and local four velocity .",
    "when one analyzes central heavy - ion collisions , one can impose the cylindrical symmetry along the collision axis on the hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic model , with cylindrical symmetry , are relatively easy to perform due to the reduction of spatial dimension .",
    "hence some groups @xcite have studied the hadron spectra in central collisions at the sps energies by their own hydrodynamic models without using bjorken s scaling solution @xcite which helps to simplify the solution . on the other hand , in order to analyze non - central collisions , and moreover , to obtain the rapidity dependence of physical quantities , we numerically solve the hydrodynamic equations without assuming cylindrical symmetry along the collision axis or bjorken s scaling solution @xcite .",
    "we adopt cartesian coordinates and rewrite the hydrodynamic equations ( [ ep ] ) and ( [ n ] ) as follows : @xmath11 where @xmath12 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we can define the direction of @xmath13-axis as the impact parameter vector and that of @xmath14-axis as the collision axis .",
    "there are two spatial symmetries with respect to the transformations @xmath15 and/or @xmath16 for the system even in non - central collisions .",
    "because of the above symmetries , we numerically solve eq .",
    "( [ he ] ) only in the region @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "we take @xmath20 and @xmath21 to be sufficiently larger than the nuclear diameter .",
    "the longitudinal size in a numerical simulation depends on the lifetime of the fluid : @xmath22 .",
    "these spatial symmetries considerably reduce the computational time of hydrodynamic simulations . if needed , it is easy to obtain the solutions in the other region @xmath23 and/or @xmath24 by the above transformations .",
    "the algorithm we used to solve the hydrodynamic equations is the piecewise parabolic method ( ppm ) @xcite .",
    "this method is a kind of godunov scheme .",
    "the ppm is known as a very robust scheme for solving a non - relativistic gas equation with a shock wave .",
    "we have extended the ppm scheme of eulerian hydrodynamics to relativistic hydrodynamic equations .",
    "this enables us to describe precisely the space - time evolution of nuclear matter with phase transition .",
    "it should be noted that the ppm is a higher order extension of the piecewise _ linear _ method such as the rhlle algorithm @xcite .      in order to solve the hydrodynamic equations , we need to specify the equation of state , especially , pressure as a function of energy density and baryon density @xmath25 .",
    "since the hydrodynamic flow is accelerated by the pressure gradient , the space - time evolution of fluid is governed by the model eos .",
    "if the qgp phase appears in nuclear collisions , the quark matter expands , cools down , and crosses the softest point @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of a fluid element is considerably suppressed near the softest point since the ratio of the pressure to the energy density takes its minimum as a function of the energy density at this point .",
    "consequently , the hydrodynamic flow at freeze - out is expected to be reduced .",
    "the softest point usually lies on the boundary between the qgp phase and the hadron phase on the @xmath26-@xmath27 plane .",
    "therefore it is expected that the hadronic observables concerning the hydrodynamic flow contain information about the eos of nuclear matter near the phase transition region @xcite .",
    "we numerically solve eq .",

    ", we adopt the resonance gas model for the hadron phase .",
    "the hadron phase is assumed to be composed of mesons and non - strange baryons up to the mass 2 gev @xcite .",
    "it is well known that pressure in the resonance gas model overcomes that of the qgp phase in high baryon density and low temperature region @xcite . to avoid this problem",
    ", we also adopt an excluded volume correction @xcite to suppress the pressure in the high baryon density region .",
    "we construct a first order phase transition model by the usual technique of gibbs phase equilibrium condition , @xmath33 ( thermal equilibrium ) , @xmath34 ( chemical equilibrium ) , and @xmath35 ( kinetic equilibrium ) .",
    "a bag constant @xmath36 mev is chosen so that the phase transition occurs at the critical temperature 160 mev at zero baryon density .",
    "the resultant pressure as a function of energy density and baryon density is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . due to the fermi energy of baryons",
    ", there exists a minimum energy density @xmath37 at a fixed baryon density . for an illustrative purpose ,",
    "we redefine the pressure as zero in the low energy density and high baryon density region in fig .",
    "the latent heat @xmath38 in our first order phase transition model is 1.4 gev/@xmath39 .",
    "the nuclear matter produced in pb + pb collisions may be isospin asymmetric since the lead nucleus is composed of 126 neutrons and 82 protons . as well as other works based on the hydrodynamic model",
    ", we assume that our model eos can be used for the isospin asymmetric matter produced in pb + pb collisions .",
    "it is difficult to describe initial hard @xmath40 collisions and pre - thermalization of the excited matter by using a one - fluid model , since hydrodynamics for a perfect fluid is applicable only to equilibrated matter .",
    "hence we apply the hydrodynamic model after the system is supposed to be thermalized .",
    "we can choose the initial time @xmath41 when the incident lorentz contracted nucleus finishes penetrating the target nucleus in the center of mass system .",
    "in the pb+pb 158 @xmath0 gev collision , we obtain @xmath42 fm . here",
    "@xmath43 is the velocity of incident nucleus in the center of mass system , @xmath44 is a radius of lead nucleus , and @xmath45 is a lorentz contracted nuclear diameter .    at the initial time @xmath41 , we suppose the initial energy density and baryon density are factorized into the longitudinal and transverse parts as follows : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is a impact parameter and @xmath48 is a transverse profile function .",
    "we can parametrize the @xmath14 dependence of the initial energy density as bjorken s solution @xcite : @xmath49 where we assume almost all the matter is in the qgp phase at @xmath41 and its phase obeys the ideal gas eos , @xmath50 .",
    "since bjorken s solution diverges on the light cone by definition , we introduce the additional factor @xmath51 so that the system has finite energy .",
    "an adjustable parameter @xmath52 is to be chosen so that we reproduce the rapidity distribution of negative hadrons .",
    "we emphasize that we have employed bjorken s solution as an initial condition .",
    "this is in contrast to refs .",
    "@xcite , in which bjorken s boost invariant solution was always assumed to be valid during expansion of nuclear matter . in bjorken s picture , the resultant physical variables do not depend on the rapidity @xmath53 anymore @xcite .",
    "we also suppose that the baryon density as a function of @xmath14 is represented by @xmath54 for the scaling solution , one takes @xmath55 ; while we take @xmath56 to be larger than unity in order to obtain the two peaks in the rapidity distribution of net proton , which are seen in the experimental data at the sps energy @xcite .",
    "initial longitudinal flow is parametrized by @xcite @xmath57 this parametrization for the longitudinal velocity is different from bjorken s solution : @xmath58 .",
    "as for the initial longitudinal velocity , this parametrization , rather than bjorken s solution , enables us to reproduce the rapidity distribution well .",
    "we also assume transverse flow vanishes at the initial time : @xmath59 .",

    "thus the transverse momentum of a decay particle @xmath124 is written in terms of @xmath89 and @xmath90 : @xmath125    the jacobian of the lorentz transformation is defined by @xmath126 the calculation of @xmath127 is straightforward , so that we do not represent it here .",
    "the normalization of momentum space volume for a decay particle in the resonance rest frame is @xmath128 we always average the decay probability over the spin of resonances , so that the decay probability does not depend on @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "thus the normalization in the resonance reference frame is @xmath131    the jacobian in eq .",
    "( [ jacobi ] ) has very narrow peaks when the resonance particle moves at a large velocity in the laboratory system @xcite . due to this singularity",
    ", it is very difficult to integrate the jacobian numerically .",
    "so we introduce a very simple monte carlo calculation to evaluate the momentum distribution from resonance decays .",

    "_ step 7 _ : if @xmath157 is positive , @xmath158 if @xmath157 is negative , @xmath159 here , @xmath160 ( @xmath161 ) is to be proportional to the number of @xmath133-mesons which are emitted from ( absorbed by ) the @xmath137-th fluid element .",
