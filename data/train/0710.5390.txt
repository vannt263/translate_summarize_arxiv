    "photonic entanglement is an essential resource for many quantum information processing applications , such as linear - optics quantum computing ( loqc ) @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , and quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite .",
    "the most widely used method for generating polarization - entangled photon pairs is spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) , which can be realized in a number of configurations and by using different crystals @xcite . a well optimized spdc source with high flux and high entanglement quality can be utilized to develop advanced enabling quantum technology such as a random number generator @xcite .",
    "certain applications such as quantum communications and loqc are often designed to operate with a system clock to allow for synchronization and , for that purpose , a pulsed source of entangled photons is needed .",
    "in other applications such as free - space entanglement - based qkd in the daylight , pulsed operation may be preferred to simplify signaling of the arrival times of the entangled photons and to provide temporal discrimination against undesirable background light .",
    "many spdc sources , however , are continuous - wave ( cw ) pumped which can not yield any timing information about when an entangled photon pair is generated .",
    "it is therefore of interest to develop an efficient pulsed source of entangled photons that can offer unique operational and application - specific advantages over a cw spdc source .",
    "we have previously developed a cw spdc source of polarization - entangled photons using a polarization sagnac interferometer ( psi ) configuration that is highly efficient and yields a high visibility in two - photon quantum interference @xcite .",
    "the sagnac source configuration is a phase - stable , single - crystal implementation of interferometrically combined outputs of two identical , coherently - driven down - converters @xcite .",
    "the psi configuration eliminates the need for spatial ( aperture ) , spectral ( interference filter ) , and temporal ( timing compensator ) filtering because the two down - converter outputs are completely indistinguishable @xcite .",
    "all the output photons are strongly polarization - entangled without the need for filtering , thus leading to a much higher generation efficiency than that of other approaches .    in principle",
    ", the sagnac configuration can be used for both cw and pulsed operation .",
    "shi and tomita have previously utilized a non - polarizing sagnac interferometer to realize a highly stable pulsed down - conversion entanglement source @xcite .",
    "the use of a non - polarizing beam splitter incurs a 50% reduction in the entanglement generation rate because when both photons exit the same port of the beam splitter ( half of the time ) it does not produce polarization entanglement . in this work",
    ", we employ a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) to eliminate this 50% loss , and we demonstrate the first pulsed operation of a sagnac down - conversion source pumped by a narrowband , mode - locked ultraviolet ( uv ) source . unlike most pulsed spdc sources that are pumped by femtosecond lasers @xcite , the pulsed sagnac source is pumped with @xmath550-ps pulses with a narrow spectral bandwidth . while the cw and pulsed sagnac sources share a common design , there can be major differences between the two types of sources . in cw",
    "down - conversion the output flux is often limited by available cw pump power , especially in the uv region .",
    "therefore cw sources are often characterized by a normalized generation efficiency in terms of the number of entangled pairs generated per second per nanometer of detection bandwidth for 1 mw of pump power . in general",
    ", the situation is different for pulsed pumping because high peak power is easily obtainable at many wavelengths , either directly from a laser or by efficient harmonic generation of a high power pulsed laser @xcite . the high peak pump power for pulsed down - conversion benefits applications that can take advantage of a substantial pair generation probability per pulse such as those requiring multiphoton coincidences for the generation of novel multipartite states in loqc @xcite . on the other hand , with high generation probabilities one must be careful with the impact of multiple - pair events on the system performance of some quantum information processing applications",
    "for instance , in free - space entanglement - based qkd the entanglement source may be strongly driven to achieve a desirable key generation rate but it should not exceed a level that may compromise the security of the generated secret keys @xcite .    we have developed a pulsed sagnac source based on type - ii phase - matched periodically poled ktiopo@xmath0 ( ppktp ) and pumped with a custom - built high - power mode - locked uv source at 390.35 nm @xcite .",
    "the sagnac source is capable of producing polarization - entangled photon pairs at 780.7 nm with a mean pair generation of as much as one per pulse , even in a small bandwidth of 0.15 nm .",
    "the narrowband pulsed sagnac source is particularly suitable for free - space entanglement - based qkd .",
    "pulsed operation affords synchronized detection of the entangled photons and provides temporal discrimination against temporally random background photons or detector dark counts .",
    "the narrowband outputs can be used with narrowband spectral filtering that is essential for blocking out ambient light during daylight operation .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe our experimental setup in the construction of the pulsed sagnac source . in section iii ,",
    "we characterize the entanglement quality of the psi output with three different types of measurements : two - photon quantum interference , violation of clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) form of bell s inequality @xcite , and quantum state tomography . in section iv",
    ", we focus on the strongly pumped sagnac source with its high - flux outputs and the accompanying visibility degradation due to occurrence of multiple - pair events , before concluding in section v.",
    "we develop the narrowband pulsed sagnac source for potential use in free - space entanglement - based qkd that must satisfy a number of operational constraints . for line - of - sight free - space qkd",
    "it has been suggested that the optimal operating wavelength is around 780 nm that takes into account atmospheric transmission and the characteristics of commercially available si avalanche photodiodes ( apds ) as single - photon counters @xcite .",
    "commercially available si apds typically have a detection quantum efficiency of @xmath550% and a rise time of @xmath5300ps .",
    "the pump for the sagnac source should have a pulse width that is small compared with the detector rise time so that the pump does not add to the timing uncertainty . at the same time",
    ", we prefer to operate the down - converter in a quasi - cw manner with a pump bandwidth that is small compared with the down - conversion phase - matching bandwidth or the spectral filter bandwidth . otherwise , some of the photon pairs generated by the broadband pump would be outside of the measurement bandwidth and the system throughput efficiency is reduced .",
    "we choose the pump requirements to have a pulse width of 100ps or less and a bandwidth of less than 0.1 nm .",
    "a narrowband down - conversion output allows the use of narrowband spectral filters inserted before the si apd detectors to screen out background light from the sky during daylight qkd operation .",
    "the pulse width and bandwidth requirements can accommodate a range of pump operating conditions and we note that transform limited pulses are not required .",
    "figure 1 shows the experimental setup for the pulsed sagnac source together with the measurement apparatus .",
    "we will briefly describe the psi configuration and more details can be found in previous cw implementations @xcite .",
    "the psi , as shown in the dashed box of fig .  1 ,",
    "is composed of two flat mirrors and a pbs that serves as the input and output optical element . within the interferometer is a nonlinear crystal for generating entangled photons by spdc .",
    "bidirectional pumping of the crystal in counter - propagating directions creates coherent superposition of the counter - propagating down - conversion outputs at the pbs , whose output photons are entangled in polarization .",
    "interferometric combination of two outputs is usually sensitive to path - length perturbations , but the psi configuration eliminates the need for path - length stabilization through its common path arrangement @xcite .",
    "moreover , the phase of the output state can be chosen by simply adjusting the relative phase between the horizontally ( @xmath6 ) and vertically ( @xmath7 ) polarized components of the pump .    for our pulsed sagnac source",
    ", we used a 10-mm long flux - grown ppktp crystal from raicol with a grating period of 7.85@xmath8 m for type - ii phase matching and degenerate wavelength output at 780.7 nm .",
    "the crystal was temperature stabilized at a phase - matching temperature of 28.6@xmath9c using a thermoelectric heater with a temperature stability of better than 0.1@xmath9c . using cw second - harmonic generation , we measured an effective nonlinear coefficient , @xmath10 of @xmath52.4pm / v . to ensure that the counter - propagating pump components reach the crystal at the same time , thus eliminating any temporal distinguishability between the two outputs , we positioned the crystal at the center of the interferometer within @xmath51 mm , which is much less than that spanned by the 50-ps pump pulse .",
    "the pulsed uv pump centered at 390.35 nm was a compact , home - built narrowband picosecond uv source based on frequency quadrupling of an amplified mode - locked fiber laser @xcite .",
    "it had a bandwidth of less than 0.1 nm , full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) .",
    "the passively mode - locked erbium - doped fiber laser with a narrowband intracavity filter was operated at 1561.4 nm at a repetition rate of 31.1mhz .",
    "the fiber laser output was amplified with a 5-w polarization - maintaining erbium - doped fiber amplifier and followed by two stages of single - pass second - harmonic generation to yield the pulsed uv output with a maximum average power of 400mw and a pulse width of @xmath550ps .",
    "because of the frequency quadrupling configuration , there was a significant amount of residual 780.7 nm light in the uv source output .",
    "as a uv pump for the sagnac source , it was necessary to filter this undesirable near - infrared ( near - ir ) light before reaching the psi .",
    "we used a pair of dichroic mirrors ( dms ) that were highly transmissive at 780.7 nm and highly reflective at 390.35 nm , and constructed a 7-bounce passage for the pump beam to filter the residual 780.7 nm light .",
    "we estimate that a suppression of 140db was achieved using this multiple - bounce dichroic mirror pair arrangement with negligible loss of uv power .",
    "the linearly polarized , collimated uv beam after the dm filter was passed through a half - wave plate ( hwp ) and a quarter - wave plate ( qwp ) to adjust the relative phase and amplitude between the @xmath6- and @xmath7-polarized components .",
    "we focused the pump into the psi using a plano - convex lens with a 15-cm focal length and with broadband anti - reflection ( ar ) coating that covered both uv and near - ir wavelengths .",
    "the ppktp crystal was centered at the pump focal spot that was measured to have a beam diameter of @xmath590@xmath8 m .",
    "the sagnac configuration calls for an input / output pbs that works at both the pump and down - conversion wavelengths .",
    "instead , we used a commercially available standard pbs cube designed and ar - coated for 780 nm but not for 390 nm .",
    "the pbs provided acceptable extinction ratio ( @xmath520:1 ) to separate the @xmath6 and @xmath7 components of the uv pump , with absorption and reflection losses of 35% at 390 nm .",
    "the pbs served to produce counter - propagating pumps for bidirectional pumping of the down - conversion crystal .",
    "an ar - coated dual - wavelength half - wave plate ( dw - hwp ) designed for 390.35 nm and 780.7 nm rotated the @xmath7-polarized pump to @xmath6 polarization that was required ( along the crystal s @xmath11-axis ) for type - ii phase matching .",
    "we note that the low extinction ratio pbs introduced a small amount of @xmath7-polarized pump at the crystal but it was not phase matched to generate any down - converted photon pairs .",
    "before the signal and idler outputs from the two bidirectionally pumped down - converters were combined at the pbs , the clockwise circulating output was rotated by 90@xmath9 with the dw - hwp such that the signal and idler beams after the pbs were spatially separated , as indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "each of the signal and idler outputs was collimated with a 15-cm focal length plano - convex lens and passed through a matching circular aperture for spatial - mode filtering .",
    "we sent the output beams to polarization analyzers each comprising a hwp and a high - extinction polarizer to measure the polarization states .",
    "a qwp could also be added for quantum state tomography measurements .",
    "we filtered both beams spectrally using interference - filters ( ifs ) with a fwhm bandwidth of @xmath50.15 nm centered at 780.7 nm and with peak transmission of 60% .",
    "the outputs were subsequently focused onto two perkinelmer si apds with @xmath550% detection efficiency .",
    "we recorded individual apd counts as well as coincidence counts and a 1.8-ns coincidence window was used @xcite .",
    "[ figure1 ]        we aligned the sagnac interferometer such that the two down - converter outputs for the signal ( and for the idler ) were spatially and temporally overlapped at the pbs output to erase any `` which - path '' information .",
    "this required symmetric positioning of the ppktp crystal inside the sagnac interferometer . at this point ,",
    "the pair generation rates from both paths were balanced and the necessary input pump polarization adjustments were made to generate a singlet - state output @xmath12 where the subscript @xmath3 ( @xmath13 ) refers to the signal ( idler ) photon . in the next two sections , we show the results of our source characterization in the low and high flux regimes .",
    "unlike most cw spdc sources , the combination of a high - power pulsed uv pump and the efficient psi source can lead to a substantial pair generation probability per pulse . in order to assess the entanglement quality of the pulsed sagnac source with minimal degradation due to multiple - pair events , we measured the characteristics of the psi output at low pumping powers .",
    "in particular , we made measurements of the two - photon quantum interference , the chsh form of bell s inequality , and quantum state tomography of the psi output state .",
    "we show that the three types of characterization methods are consistent with each other .",
    "the signal - idler quantum interference measurement in two incompatible polarization bases , @xmath6-@xmath7 and @xmath1445@xmath9 antidiagonal - diagonal ( @xmath15-@xmath16 ) , is a common and relatively simple method to assess the entanglement quality of the source . for each of the polarization measurement bases ,",
    "the signal polarization analyzer angle is set at one of the basis polarization axes and the coincidence counts are monitored as a function of the idler analyzer angle .",

    "the remaining reduction in the conditional detection probability can be attributed to spatial filtering that was provided by the 2-mm diameter aperture , which is a typical problem due to the multimode nature of spdc with an unfocused or weakly focused pump @xcite .",
    "we measured a si apd dark - count rate of @xmath550/s , and the non - parametric fluorescence counts were less than 5% of the measured singles which , at this pump level , did not contribute to any accidental coincidences .",

    "we will also concentrate on the effect of multiple pair generation on entanglement quality and how that effect can be utilized to measure the pair generation probability accurately .",
    "there are three main contributions to the observation of accidental coincidences in the typical measurement setup of fig .  1 .",
    "the first type of contribution is due to the generation of independent multiple entangled pairs from a multimode spdc source under strong pumping .",
    "if the detected coincident photon pair originates from two different signal - idler pairs , there is no polarization correlation and therefore an error may occur .",
    "considering the case of two - pair events , the production rate is proportional to the square of the pump power .",
    "the second type of contribution is caused by the detection of one photon from a down - converted photon pair and a uv - induced fluorescence photon emitted by the ppktp crystal which we measured to have a generation rate of less than 5% of the singles count rate .",
    "since the fluorescence varies linearly with the pump power , the accidental coincidence rate is proportional to the square of the pump power .",
    "there is also the possibility of an accidental coincidence due to the detection of two fluorescence photons , but the probability is much lower than the case when one of the detected photons belongs to a down - converted pair .",
    "the third contribution comes from background photons from stray light and from detector dark counts .",
    "both events are independent of the pump power and generally the background and dark counts are low enough that accidental coincidences caused by them are negligible .",
    "the above discussion on accidental coincidences applies to both cw and pulsed spdc .",
    "however , more accidental coincidences are observed in the pulsed case than in the cw case for the same average pumping power .",
    "if we assume the same spdc setup , then the same average input power yields the same number of down - converted pairs per second for the cw and pulsed cases . in cw operation , the spdc pair or fluorescence photon generation probability within a coincidence window of duration @xmath48 is proportional to @xmath48 . the cw accidental coincidence rate resulting from two - pair events",
    "is then given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is a proportionality constant .",
    "on the other hand , for pulsed spdc with a repetition rate of @xmath51 , the pair or fluorescence emission is localized within each pump pulse duration , whose width is typically smaller than @xmath48 , as in our setup . therefore , the spdc pair ( or fluorescence photon ) generation probability per pulse ( alternatively , per coincidence window ) is proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "the accidental coincidence probability per pulse is then proportional to @xmath53 , and the accidental coincidence rate is @xmath54 .",
    "note that the cw and pulsed cases have the same proportionality as long as the same type of accidental coincidences is considered . for the same input power ,",
    "the ratio of their accidental rates is    @xmath55    using a typical value for the coincidence window duration @xmath56ns , the repetition rate of @xmath57mhz for our pulsed pump implies that @xmath58 .",
    "that is , our pulsed system is much more susceptible to visibility degradation due to accidental coincidences compared with a cw source with the same entangled pair generation rate .",
    "equivalently , the cw source can tolerate a much higher average pump power than a pulsed source ( @xmath518@xmath59 in our case ) for the same amount of accidental coincidences .",
    "this problem can be minimized by increasing the repetition rate until it is comparable to @xmath60 . increasing the repetition rate , however , has its own problems .",
    "for instance , typical si apds are not able to handle detection rates much higher than a few mhz .",
    "also , it is not desirable to have @xmath61 because of the need for temporal separation of the pulses . for a pulsed source designed for a specific application such as qkd , one must be aware of the trade - offs between the need for a high pair generation rate and the desire for high entanglement quality , and strike an application - specific balance for the appropriate combination of pump powers , repetition rates , detector speeds , and error budget .",
    "the uv - induced fluorescence rate was measured by detuning the phase matching temperature so that only fluorescence photons were detectable and we found that it was only a small fraction ( @xmath55% ) of the detected singles rate . therefore multiple - pair generation is the main contributor to accidental coincidences in our setup .",

    "consider an ideal pulsed spdc source that generates singlet - state polarization - entangled photon pairs , and there are no background or fluorescence photons .",

    "that is , each mode has an occupation number of either 0 or 1 .",
    "we note that the assumption of the poisson distribution is not valid for single - mode outputs , but we have found that the results below do not change significantly when we replace it with a thermal distribution .",
