    "a quantum simulation protocol called  boson sampling \" , proposed by aaronson and arkhipov  @xcite , represents a serious challenge to the extended church - turing thesis , which asserts that a turing machine ( i.e. , a classical computer ) , is capable of simulating all physical systems ( including quantum systems ) _ efficiently_. in boson sampling , indistinguishable and non - interacting photons are injected into a linear optical network , which results in a  combinatorial explosion \" that leads to the failure of all known classical simulation algorithms .",
    "compared with a fully - working quantum computer , boson sampling consumes less physical resources for implementation ; it requires only passive optical devices and photon detectors .",
    "recently , successful small - scale experimental realizations of boson sampling have been reported  @xcite . however , the current technique is still far from demonstrating the quantum supremacy with large - scale implementations of boson sampling .",
    "for example , the preparation of the initial fock states can only be achieved with an exponentially - small probability , without a reliable single - photon source .    several generalized boson sampling schemes , sharing similar computational complexity , have been reported .",
    "for example , the scattershot boson sampling  @xcite using two - mode squeezed states was suggested to overcome the difficulty in preparing the initial fock states , and is experimentally demonstrated  @xcite .",
    "non - classical quantum optical states like displaced fock states , photon - added or subtracted squeezed vacuum states , and cat states have been considered  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a time - domain boson sampling method has been proposed  @xcite for a scalable implementation of boson sampling .    apart from photons , non - optical boson sampling , including trapped - ion  @xcite and superconducting circuits  @xcite",
    "have been proposed theoretically , which aims to overcome the state - preparation problem , and can be readily extended to gaussian input states  @xcite , including squeezed vacuum and squeezed coherent states for molecular applications  @xcite .    in particular ,",
    "rahimi - keshari and coworkers  @xcite considered the gaussian boson sampling , where the input states for the optical network are a product of single - mode gaussian states e.g. thermal states and squeezed vacuum states .",
    "it was found that , similar to the original version of boson sampling , simulating gaussian boson sampling is still a hard problem for classical devices .",
    "moreover , the molecular problem proposed by huh et al .",
    "@xcite represents an application of gaussian boson sampling for sampling molecular transitions at zero temperature .",
    "therein , quantum simulation of the molecular spectroscopy can be achieved by passing through uncorrelated single - mode squeezed coherent or squeezed vacuum states through an optical network",
    ".    however , to simulate molecular transitions at finite temperatures , the boson modes are in general correlated .",
    "therefore , the molecular problems belong to a generalized gaussian boson sampling problem , which involves the preparation of general gaussian states , with mode correlation in general , as the input for boson sampling . to distinguish it from the gaussian boson sampling studied in the literature  @xcite",
    ", we refer to it as  vibronic boson sampling \" , as the study is motivated by the molecular sampling problem .",
    "because vibronic boson sampling captures the initial correlation not included in gaussian boson sampling , the term may be used interchangeably with  generalized gaussian boson sampling \" .    here",
    "we present a hierarchical structure relating gaussian boson sampling and vibronic boson sampling , and providing a framework to unify scattershot boson sampling with gaussian boson sampling .",
    "specifically , we present an explicit procedure to show how the initial correlation in vibronic boson sampling can be absorbed into the operations of gaussian boson sampling with the cost of doubling the number of modes , in a way similar to scattershot boson sampling . however , in scattershot boson sampling , the original modes are correlated with ancillary modes .",
    "furthermore , there exists a thermal - state decomposition for every gaussian state , which implies an explicit procedure of preparing gaussian state from a thermal state . in our approach",
    ", we can avoid sampling the initial thermal distribution by replacing the procedure with a squeezing operation acting jointly on the original modes and a set of ancilla modes in the vacuum state .",
    "moreover , we show that such a squeezing operation can be absorbed through a multi - dimensional bogoliubov transformation in the extended hilbert space , the joint operation consists of sequential operations of displacement - rotation - squeezing - rotation operators  @xcite .",
    "in general , the probability @xmath0 of a projective measurement @xmath1 for sampling bosons , with the scattering operator @xmath2 and an input state @xmath3 , is given by , @xmath4 .",

    "one of the main goals of this work is to introduce the idea of sampling bosons with the most general gaussian state , referred to as vibronic boson sampling , which is motivated by the problem of sampling molecular vibrational transitions at finite temperatures .    besides",
    ", the connection between boson sampling and molecular transitions was first made in huh et al .",
    "@xcite , where the mode correlation can be absorbed into local operations .",
    "however , such a procedure is possible for gaussian states associated with the vacuum state ( i.e. , zero temperature ) only . in other words ,",
    "the vibronic boson sampling problem at zero temperature is an instance of the gaussian boson sampling , where the input gaussian states are associated with finite temperatures in general .",
    "we now address the problem of thermal state preparation in gaussian boson sampling , which is relevant in the thermal extension of the sampling problem  @xcite for vibronic transitions in molecular spectroscopy .",
    "boson sampling with thermal input states , as an instance of gaussian boson sampling , has been considered  @xcite , where it is shown that the distribution can be simulated by a classical computer efficiently . as a result",
    ", such a problem belongs to the complexity class @xmath42 , which is , supposedly , less complex than the counting problems in the complexity class @xmath43p .    instead of sampling the thermal distribution ,",
    "our approach starts with a purification of the mixed initial states , which is a standard method for studying thermo - field dynamics  @xcite , to prepare and identify the thermally excited fock states given in the boltzmann distribution .",
    "our work constructs the hierarchy relation between the gaussian state boson samplings  @xcite and generalize the concept of the gaussian boson sampling via allowing the correlation of input bosons .",
    "specifically , the transition probability for obtaining the final fock state @xmath44 from the distribution of a thermal state @xmath24 , applied by a ( generally - defined ) scattering operator @xmath2 , is given by @xmath45 \\ .\\ ] ] in this work , we extend the idea of scattershot boson sampling  @xcite for the problem of sampling thermalized bosons .",
    "this is possible because we can always consider the sampling problem with an initial distribution as sampling a pair of fock states , @xmath46 \\ .\\ ] ] the key idea of scattershot boson sampling is to send half of entangled photons through the optical network , followed by a post - selection for projecting out the single - photon states at the end .",
    "the main purpose is to overcome the experimental difficulty of preparing single - photon states required in boson sampling .",
    "the resulting probability of getting the desired outcomes is significantly lower than the original boson sampling .",
    "however , the computational - hardness argument remains the same .    in order to extend the idea of scattershot boson sampling for thermal initial states ,",
    "we first consider the purification of every thermal state with ancillary modes , i.e. , @xmath47 where the ancillary hilbert space b has been introduced again .",
    "note that the original thermal state @xmath24 can be obtained after tracing away the ancillary modes , i.e. , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",

    "@xmath57 is a mean quantum number of the @xmath58-th mode .",

    "\\label{eq : probthermal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the scattershot boson sampling  @xcite represents a similar approach .",
