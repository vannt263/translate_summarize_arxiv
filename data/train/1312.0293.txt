    "plane can be expected . and this kind of anisotropy will lead to a strong spin coupling along @xmath6 axis , and therefore plays an essential role for the emergency of spontaneous polarization  @xcite . according to the observation of the low temperature magnetic structure , sato et al.@xcite have confirmed that the relation @xmath38@xmath39 holds in licu@xmath0o@xmath0 compound , where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the ferroelectric polarization , the modulation vector and the helical axis of the ordered spins .",
    "this indicates that the theories derived by phenomenological@xcite and microscopic models  @xcite are also applied for polarization of licu@xmath0o@xmath0 .",

    "after that , the thermodynamic properties concerned in this paper are collected in a warming process with @xmath66 along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "the purpose of the poling procedure is to produce a single magnetoelectric domain with magnetic modulation vector along the chain .",

    "the choice depends on the sets of parameters . in the present simulation , due to a large negative magnetic anisotropy @xmath35=@xmath685 in the diagonal of @xmath7 plane , the ground state composed of the spiral spin structure with spiral axis along the [ 110 ] direction",
    "is generated .",
    "figure 3(a ) presents the typical snapshot for the spin configuration at lowest temperature , demonstrating the formation of the spiral order at ground state . in order to analyze the spiral spin state accurately",

    "the sharp characteristic peaks appear at @xmath76 and its equivalent position in @xmath77 , which confirm a good spiral spin order formed in ground states , as shown in fig .",
    "in addition , it is worth noted that the wavelength of spin structure will be limited by the periodic boundary condition , therefore the lattice size dependence of wave vector @xmath78 is examined to verify the perfect spiral spin structure . as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the value of @xmath78 vibrates with @xmath62 varying , and the amplitude of vibration decreases as @xmath62 increases .",
    "when @xmath62 exceeds 80 , the wave vector remains in the same position and the vibration disappears , indicating the negligible size effects under this circumstance .",

    "it can be seen that the results obtained with lattice size @xmath74 are almost identical with those obtained from larger lattice size .      in the following ,",
    "we will concentrate on the magnetoelectric properties of licu@xmath0o@xmath0 from two aspects : the macroscopic thermodynamic behaviors and microscopic magnetic and ferroelectric structures . for the former",
    ", the simulation results on the bulk properties will be made a detail comparison with those of experimental results to reveal the spiral spin order nature of the ferroelectricity .",
    "as for the latter , our focus is on the influences of the exchange couplings and anisotropies on the spiral spin states , which will be explored by evaluating the spin structure factors .    in fig . 5 ,",
    "the temperature dependence of magnetization @xmath81 and susceptibility @xmath82 under a small magnetic field are presented .",
    "it can be seen that our simulation result is qualitatively in good agreement with experimental data in two aspects .",
    "first , @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) for @xmath83 exceeds that for @xmath84 , reproducing the anisotropic behaviors observed in licu@xmath0o@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the negligible differences in the magnetization data between @xmath3 and @xmath5 axis are also in accord with recent report on untwinned crystals  @xcite .",
    "second , at intermediate temperature , for all three field directions , a broad maximum presents in the @xmath81 and @xmath82 curves , indicating the short - range antiferromagnetic correlations of the low - dimensional system . with the temperature increasing ,",
    "a high - temperature curie - weiss susceptibility is exhibited .",
    "in addition , it is worth noted that the ratio of @xmath85 here is great than 1 , suggestive of a strong `` rung '' coupling in this compound .    to make a full comparison , in fig .",
    "6 we present the results of the spontaneous polarization @xmath40 and its electric susceptibility @xmath86 along the @xmath6 axis , as well as the specific heat @xmath60 of the system .",
    "similar to the experimental discovery , the two magnetic phase transitions are also observed in our specific heat data .",
    "for convenience and uniformity , the lower - temperature phase is marked as @xmath13 and the other is marked as @xmath11 . as shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) , the main characteristics of @xmath87 observed in licu@xmath0o@xmath0 are qualitatively reproduced based on the spin - current model .",
    "below the transition temperature @xmath13 , @xmath87 gradually emerges and is accompanied by the sharp peak arising in electric susceptibility @xmath88 ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) and specific heat ( fig .",
    "6(c ) ) , and then rises rapidly and almost reaches saturation below a lower temperature .",
    "when the system is polarized by an opposite electric field , @xmath87 is reversed as well , indicating the ferroelectric nature of spiral order phase  @xcite .",
    "however , the reported remarkable field effects on the electric polarization  @xcite have not been exhibited in our results . as shown in figs .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) , @xmath87 and @xmath88 display the negligible responses for the field applied along different directions .",
    "this discrepancy implies the profound effects of the quantum fluctuations in licu@xmath0o@xmath0 . in the specific heat data ,",
    "the phase transition at @xmath11 is exhibited and indicated by the smaller and round peak .",
    "experimentally , it is found that this transition is associated with collinear spin structure with the spins sinusoidally modulated along the @xmath6 axis .",
    "its origin has not been explored yet . in the following , a conjecture and corresponding analysis on the possibilities that induce this transition will be given .",
    "in multiferroic system , spiral spin order is a common way to induce the ferroelectricity and always yields some surprising physical properties , such as flop , reversal and rotation of the electric polarization in an external magnetic field .",
    "it usually generated by the frustration in the magnetic materials , which origins from the competition of various interactions .",
    "therefore , analyzing the impacts of different couplings on the spiral spin states is helpful to understand the magnetoelectric properties in multiferroics .",
    "figure 7(a ) displays the influences of the `` rung '' coupling @xmath31 on the two transitions of the magnetic specific heat @xmath60 . from a general view",
    ", the two transition temperatures suffer the slight affections and almost keep at the original positions , while their corresponding peak values present the different responses .",
    "the transition of @xmath11 shows the ignorable variations , but the transition of @xmath13 exhibits the complex dependent relation on @xmath31 . for the sake of discussion ,",
    "a parameter @xmath53=@xmath85 is introduced here .",
    "one can see that for @xmath89 , an evident suppression on the peak of @xmath13 is presented .",
    "the ability of the system resisting the thermal fluctuations is enhanced as well . while below @xmath53=1 , the transition at @xmath13 has no response to the variation of @xmath31 .",
    "these phenomenon are confirmed by the spin structure factors in figs .",
    "7(b ) and ( c ) . at @xmath53=1 , the peak of @xmath69 moves towards large @xmath72 with its intensity decreasing , indicating the modulated period of the incommensurate spin structure shortened by enhancing @xmath31 .",
    "these variations also demonstrate the fact that the spiral order can be significantly modified under the strong rung coupling .",
    "as @xmath53 continues increasing , @xmath69 shows very subtle decrease on its peak value , suggestive of a balance of the energy competition between the items of @xmath31 and @xmath29 .",
    "however , it is worth noted that a non - zero value appears at @xmath90 for @xmath89 , and it acts in a more obvious way with the increase of @xmath53 , as shown inset of fig .",
    "this unusual dependence implies the arise of the low - temperature weak ferromagnetism .      for a classical spin chain ,",
    "when @xmath30 is larger than a critical value 1/4 , an incommensurate spiral spin structure with pitching angle @xmath91 can be expected at ground state  @xcite . and",
    "therefore the changes of @xmath29 will evidently modify the magnitude of @xmath92 and are macroscopically reflected in the variations of magnetic phase patterns . as shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) , the two magnetic phase transitions both shift towards high temperature with the increasement of @xmath29 .",
    "the peak at @xmath13 transition becomes sharp and is greatly strengthened , indicating the major adjustment of the spiral spin order , while the one at @xmath11 remains in a round shape and its almost constant height .",
    "this is also vividly demonstrated in the picture of the spin structure factors ( fig .",
    "8(b ) ) . when the value of @xmath29 is very close to that of @xmath31 , the peak of @xmath69 is remarkably enhanced and moves towards large @xmath72 .",
    "as @xmath29 further increases , the peak of @xmath69 continues shifting to large value of @xmath72 with its intensity invariant .",
    "this implies the reduction of the modulated period and the improvement of spirality between nearest - neighbor spins . in other words , it means the increasement of the pitch angle and macroscopically enhancement of the polarization , which is also well confirmed by our simulation results @xmath87 ( not shown here ) . in addition , at @xmath90 , @xmath69 starts at a small value and approaches to zero finally , reflecting the furious competition between @xmath29 and @xmath31 , which has been analyzed in fig .",
    "easy - plane anisotropy can enhance chiral correlation and is expected to exist in the edge - sharing spin - chain compounds . for example , in licuvo@xmath1 , a prominent of easy - plane anisotropy is probed by esr  @xcite .",
    "this anisotropy is expected to pin the spins to the @xmath7 plane , which is also verified in experiment . in our simulation",
    ", we find that it is also an indispensable factor for the occurrence of two phase transitions . in fig .",
    "9 , the temperature dependence of @xmath60 for different anisotropies @xmath25 are presented . here",
    "the `` rung '' coupling @xmath93 is made as the effects of the anisotropy are more obvious in this way and the results are qualitatively similar to those of @xmath94 . as is shown , two humps appear with the anisotropy introduced . with the increase of @xmath25 , one of the two humps",
    "becomes sharp and moves to a higher temperature while the other keeps almost at the original place . at @xmath95 ,",
    "the two subpeaks merge into one , implying the existence of the quasi - long - range spiral order and also indicated in the electric susceptibility ( not shown here ) .",
    "in fact , even though the easy - plane anisotropy enhanced the spiral order , it suppresses the coupling between spin along the @xmath6 axis , which is disadvantage for the formation of the polarization .",
    "however , because of the large magnitude of magnetic anisotropy @xmath35 chosen in this simulation , it makes sure the strong spin coupling along the @xmath6 axis , stabilizing the electric polarization arising at low temperature .",
    "worth to mentioned , we find that the easy - plane anisotropy is a critical factor of inducing phase transition at @xmath11 , as it can generate the competition of energies from the @xmath7 plane spin coupling and the @xmath6 axis spin coupling . certainly , whether the spin configuration is sinusoidal modulation at this phase transition is still need further investigation . and",
    "we will discuss it in somewhere else .    to analyze the variations of the microscopic magnetic and ferroelectric structures ,",
    "the @xmath72 dependence of @xmath69 for different @xmath25 is calculated as shown in fig .",
    "10 . at @xmath25=0.4 ,",
    "the maximum and sharp peak at @xmath72=0.32@xmath96 indicates the domination of spiral order at @xmath13 .",
    "it worth noted that another two tiny peaks also appear at @xmath72=0.02@xmath96 and @xmath72=@xmath96 respectively , which suggestive of the existence of other possible magnetic phases at ground state .",
    "since our focus is on the spiral order in this paper , the reason on the appearance of these two phases will not be discussed here . with the increase of @xmath25 , the magnetic phase at low temperature manifests as enhanced spiral order mixed with weak ferromagnetism . as @xmath970.7",
    ", only two characteristic sharp peaks appearing at @xmath78 and its equivalent position 2@xmath96-@xmath78 signify the formation of the quasi - long - ranged spiral order . to have a close view , the magnified of the collective behaviors of @xmath69 for various @xmath25",
    "are presented in fig . 11 . as @xmath25 increases ,",
    "the tiny and round peak is enhanced and become sharp with a shift towards small value of @xmath72 , indicating the increasement of the modulated period of spiral order . at @xmath25=0.7 and @xmath25=0.8 ,",
    "the peak height keeps constant and in the same position .",
    "a stable spiral order seems to be formed under this circumstance .",
    "however , when @xmath25 continues increase , the peak of @xmath69 with its invariant height shifts to large @xmath72 , demonstrating the complexity of @xmath25 on the magnetic ordered states .",
    "in summary , based on the ellipsoidal spiral structure at ground state , we qualitatively reproduce the complicated magnetoelectric behaviors observed in licu@xmath0o@xmath0 by performing monte carlo simulation .",
    "our results indicate that the spin current model or the inverse dzyaloshiskii - mariya mechanism still works even though large quantum fluctuation exists in this compound .",
    "the spin structure factors have been evaluated to confirm the spiral spin order at lowest temperature and detect the variations of the microscopic magnetic structure .",
    "the divers effects of the different exchange couplings and exchange anisotropies on the magnetic patterns have been vividly demonstrated in this simulation .",
    "it turns out that the `` rung '' coupling @xmath31 can not be simply neglected , and the exchange anisotropy has a complicated influences on the magnetic order .",
    "besides , the deviation of the field responses of the polarization from the experiment implies the importance of quantum fluctuation in this s=1/2 spiral magnet , which requires further studies on this interesting ferroelectric cuprate .",
