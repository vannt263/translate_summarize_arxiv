    "atom chips built by lithographically patterned evaporated gold wires  @xcite on si substrates on the contrary can show edge roughness smaller than the scale of the gold grains .",
    "the observed disorder potential in these chips can be orders of magnitude smaller and is caused by the local properties of the conductor ; edge effects are negligible in many cases  @xcite .",
