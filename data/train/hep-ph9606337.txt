    "the problem of computing the distribution functions for gluons at very small x is an old one  @xcite .",
    "the gluon ( and quark ) distribution functions are computable in perturbation theory at large values of x , but at small x one encounters a so called lipatov enhancement .",
    "the precise computation of this enhancement is subject to much uncertainty primarily because at some point in the evolution the density of gluons becomes so large that there are mutual interactions of the gluons which are ignored in the bfkl equation .",
    "in addition , the behavior at small x also involves knowing the distribution function at small @xmath0 , and again non - perturbative information seems to be needed .",
    "recently a different framework was advocated for the computation of the gluon distribution functions @xcite .",
    "the starting point of this approach is to view a hadron not as a collection of a small number of partons , but rather as a system with finite parton density . in the high density situation the natural way to describe the soft gluons is not as quasi - free particles , but as classical fields with large amplitude .",
    "these classical fields are generated by classical color charges which represent the valence partons .",
    "once the high density effects are resummed into the classical fields one may apply weak coupling methods to calculate quantum corrections . in this approach ,",
    "high gluon densities which prove so problematic in the bfkl context are a prerequisite for the description of the parton content of a nucleus wave function via classical gluon fields .",
    "a consistent separation in field and particle like degrees of freedom can be performed most easily in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "the object of computation is the intrinsic @xmath1 and @xmath2 contributions to the infinite momentum hadronic wavefunction in the light cone gauge .",
    "distribution functions are given as @xmath3   = \\int_0^{q^2}\\hspace{-0.2em }          d^2p_\\perp { { dn } \\over { dxd^2p_\\perp}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the intrinsic parton distributions as computed by taking the expectation value of the number operator in the state of interest .",
    "in the infinite momentum frame the valence partons are strongly lorentz contracted .",
    "if we then look for spread out gluon fields at @xmath4 interactions between valence partons and soft gluon fields eikonalize which indeed allows us to take the particle limit for the fast moving partons . here",
    "a is the baryon number of a nucleus . for a hadron , @xmath5 .",
    "the hadron will indeed appear as an infinitesimally thin sheet on the scale of wavelengths associated with the momentum fraction @xmath1 .",
    "( we will later see that we will have to regularize this source by giving it a large but finite momentum and a longitudinal extent of order @xmath6 where @xmath7 is its size in the rest frame and @xmath8 is its lorentz gamma factor .",
    "we will find that nothing in leading order of our computations depends upon the details of this regularization . ) in addition , for a thick nucleus , since the number of sources of charge per unit area scales as @xmath9 , we may view the valence partons ( quarks ) as classical color charges .",
    "therefore , somewhat paradoxically the simplest problem to start with is computing the gluon distributions for a very large nucleus .",
    "we will find later that at very small x , the glue as well as valence quarks contribute to the charge density seen by a gluon .",
    "the gluons which contribute to the charge density are all gluons with an x larger than the x of the gluon whose structure function is being measured .",
    "therefore the consideration discussed above for nuclei will apply to hadrons when at sufficiently small x so that the number of gluons at larger values of x is large .",
    "the advantage of nuclei is that large densities of charge are generated at larger values of x , and therefore lower energy per nucleon , than is the case for a single hadron",
    ".    a solution of this problem would be useful in a variety of contexts .",
    "the approach we advocate involves knowledge of the nuclear wave function and is somewhat related to the approach of mueller for heavy quarkonia  @xcite .",
    "our approach in principle allows the resolution of various phenomenological problems which arise in the parton cascade model of particle production in heavy ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "these models provide the initial condition for hydrodynamic calculations  @xcite .",
    "a model which builds in the space - time structure we advocate and uses the information we have generated for the infinite momentum frame wave functions is given in ref .",

    "the parameter @xmath14 is the valence color charge per unit area ( scaled by a factor @xmath15 ) . in leading order ,",
    "the expectation value is given by a classical field which is a solution of the yang - mills equation @xmath16 which is then averaged over different values of @xmath17    in the limit where the gluon field generated by these valence quarks is treated classically , the gluon field is a non - abelian weizscker - williams field , and has the form @xmath18 and @xmath19 the field @xmath20 is a two dimensional `` pure gauge '' @xmath21    the physical justification for the non - abelian weizscker - williams field is that because the source of charge is confined to a thin sheet , the solution must solve the free equations of motion everywhere but on the sheet .",
    "the solution is therefore a gauge transform of zero field on either side of the sheet .",
    "the discontinuity of the fields across the sheet gives the charge density .",
    "it was suggested by mclerran and venugopalan that this simple model should give a decent approximation for the soft glue distribution function .",
    "it turns out , however that the corrections to the distribution function calculated in this way are large at small @xmath1 .",
    "technically there are two sources for these corrections , although both have the same physical origin .",
    "first , as we will show the behavior of the correlation function calculated in this simple minded approach is singular at small @xmath2 .",
    "the flaw in the treatment of ref .",
    "@xcite was that the source of charge was not treated as an extended distribution which tends to a delta function only in the infinite momentum limit  @xcite .",
    "physically it is clear that the charge density is indeed spread out on the scale of the characteristic longitudinal momentum of the hard particles which generate this density .",
    "the second source of large corrections is basically the same small @xmath1 enhancement as in standard perturbative calculations .",
    "as was shown in  @xcite the quantum corrections to the distribution functions calculated in terms of the classical fields become large at small @xmath1 , the enhancement factor being the infamous @xmath22 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that the two corrections are physically related and to outline a solution to both problems .",
    "we will show that the small @xmath1 enhancement arises from quantum fluctuations with large longitudinal momentum .",
    "we show that such configurations may be successively integrated out by using renormalization group techniques reminiscent of the wilson block spin method .",
    "this approach can also be interpreted in terms of the adiabatic or born - oppenheimer approximation extensively used in atomic physics .",
    "integrating out hard quantum fluctuations is equivalent to including the harder gluons into what we call the charge density @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ mv ] ) while calculating the distribution of the softer glue .",
    "it therefore leads to `` renormalization '' of the charge density and endows it with nontrivial and calculable longitudinal structure .",
    "this modified , momentum dependent distribution of source strengths leads to infrared non - singular correlation functions .",
    "we argue that the result is sensitive only to the average charge squared per unit rapidity per unit transverse area of the source .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows :    in section [ sec : extstruct ] we study the classical problem of computing the fields associated with a source of charge which is extended in @xmath23 .",
    "we find the general solution to this problem in light cone gauge .",
    "we compute the resulting distribution functions assuming that the source is random in @xmath24 and @xmath23 , but with a weight of charge squared per unit rapidity per unit area which is specified .    in section [ sec : rgcharge ]",
    ", we show by using the renormalization group techniques how to generate classical fields at some rapidity scale @xmath25 .",
    "this involves perturbatively integrating out modes at larger values of rapidity ( smaller values of @xmath23 ) .",
    "this integration generates an effective lagrangian which has a self similar form , namely that at each step of the procedure it is similar to the mclerran - venugopalan model but with a charge per unit area which is rapidity dependent .",
    "we show that this effective theory is equivalent to that discussed in section [ sec : extstruct ] .",
    "we derive the renormalization group equations for the charge squared per unit area per unit rapidity as measured at some transverse momentum scale @xmath0 and rapidity @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the nucleus rapidity , and @xmath28 . the calculations in this section",
    "rely on several simplifying approximations , which we discuss .    in section",
    "[ sec : rgchi ] , we study the renormalization group equations for the charge squared per unit rapidity per unit area as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath25 . this equation is closely related to the usual evolution equations for distribution function which appear in standard perturbative treatments .",

    "we show that for @xmath2 much larger than the momentum scale associated with the charge squared per unit rapidity integrated over all rapidities larger than that at which we measure the structure functions ( which we will refer to as @xmath29 ) , the nonlinearities in the rg equation become unimportant . in this regime",
    "the equation basically describes the double log dglap evolution . at lower momenta our equation",

    "we discuss the consistency issues which are necessary for a solution of this equation within the set of approximations for which our derivation is valid .    in the final sections we summarize our results .",

    "ignoring the commutator term is however not justified .",
    "it is clear that this term in eq.([eom ] ) is very singular and involves a product of @xmath49 and @xmath50 . to make sense of this structure",

    "this can only be done if we know the structure of the source in @xmath23 .",

    "this is parameterized by some strength of charge squared per unit area per unit space - time rapidity @xmath56 , and by the charge per unit area at rapidities greater than @xmath25 @xmath57 the parameter @xmath0 appears because we must specify at what value of @xmath0 we are measuring the distribution function .",

    "( [ chi ] ) , ( [ rhoint ] ) are therefore effectively cutoff at this upper limit . ] . in the previous work we took great pain to argue that the charge could be treated classically on transverse scales which are large compared to the density of partons per unit area .",
    "this was because on this scale there is a large number of partons contributing to the source , and therefore the charges were in a large dimensional representation of the color group .",
    "this allowed a classical treatment .",
    "the longitudinal structure is a new ingredient .",
    "why can we still approximate the partons ( gluons ) that couple to soft glue by a classical source ? the physical reason is easy to understand : for these high momentum gluons the coupling is weak , so that to change the field ( the soft glue ) by a correction of order one , one must have many ( hard ) gluons contributing . in the next section , we will see that the induced source of gluons is in fact slowly varying in rapidity @xmath61 again , we will see this justified in more detail in the next section .",
    "therefore these sources of charge come from an extended region of space - time rapidity with a typical contribution at a rapidity far greater than that of the field we are computing .",
    "the source will therefore appear to be infinitesimally thin in the variable @xmath23 .",
    "we must solve eq .",

    "this non - perturbative regime is nevertheless a weak coupling regime .",

    "there is saturation , and there is again no dependence upon @xmath107 .",
    "the dependence is really only in the region of very small momenta ( @xmath109 ) , where our approximation is in any case not valid .",
    "this result is almost consistent with the structure which was advocated by mclerran and venugopalan  @xcite .",
    "they had argued that at small transverse momentum , the above correlation function should approach a constant .",
    "it does up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "( the line of reasoning in  @xcite was however incorrect since it was based on an analysis of an equation that did not properly handle the induced charge associated with the gluon field , that is the @xmath110 $ ] term in the equation which determines the gluon field in terms of the external charge density ) .",
    "in previous work , it was shown that radiative corrections to the distribution functions computed in the mclerran - venugopalan model are large  @xcite .",
    "the first order correction comes from the diagram , fig.[fig : twolegs ] .",
    "the modification of the distribution function is of order @xmath111 at large @xmath102 and small @xmath1 . for @xmath112 , the natural @xmath102 scale in the problem , the corrections are of order @xmath113 . in any case , for small values of @xmath1 , these corrections become large and can not be ignored .",
    "0.5=4.5 cm    in this section , we will set up a renormalization group procedure that sums up these corrections .",
    "the method of analysis is the following : we first consider the bare mclerran  venugopalan model at a fixed valence charge density , and a fixed ultraviolet cutoff in the longitudinal momentum @xmath114 .",
    "physically @xmath114 is of the order of the longitudinal momentum of the nucleus .",
    "it sets the scale of size for the longitudinal extent of the nucleus .    the renormalization group is implemented by considering the effective lagrangian at a scale of momentum @xmath115 much less than @xmath114 but where @xmath116 . to generate this effective lagrangian",
    ", we integrate out quantum fluctuations with momentum @xmath117 .",
    "this procedure , as will be seen generates a new effective lagrangian of the same form as the original one , but with an additional charge squared per unit area .",
    "the typical scale of fluctuation of this additional charge squared per unit area is @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath0 is a typical transverse momentum resolution scale at which the gluon distribution is ultimately measured .",
    "since the form of the lagrangian is unchanged under integration of these high momentum modes , except for the overall scale factor @xmath14 , the procedure can then be repeated and yet lower momentum modes can be integrated out .",
    "importantly , as long as the coupling constant is small and also @xmath120 is small the quantum fluctuations can be integrated out perturbatively , so that the computation is controlled .",
    "this perturbative treatment considers fluctuations around the classical solution in the region of the phase space which is being integrated out , as small .",
    "it is important to realize , however that the classical solution itself in this region of momenta is changed relative to the one at the previous step of the rg procedure .",
    "this is because it solves classical equations in the presence of the additional charge @xmath118 .",
    "this allows us to generate an effective lagrangian at some scale of @xmath5 .",
    "this is in a region where the naive mclerran - venugopalan model would have broken down .",
    "analogously , we can also allow the transverse momentum cutoff @xmath0 to be changed independently by a renormalization group transformation .",
    "this corresponds to perturbatively integrating out quantum modes in a phase space region with transverse momenta between @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "this latter rg transformation is the counterpart in our approach of the standard perturbative renormalization group scaling .    in the process of doing these transformations",
    "we develop a set of renormalization group equations for @xmath123 .",
    "these equations determine the rapidity and @xmath0 dependence of this parameter .",
    "we also determine the equation for the gluon field .",
    "it will turn out that this equation is a little more complicated than that in the previous section , since the induced charge depends upon the gluon field strength squared at the previous step of the renormalization group analysis .",
    "we argue that it should be a reasonable approximation to replace this field strength squared by its average value , in which case the equations described in the previous section can be derived .",
    "there are corrections to this approximation which are in principle computable .",
    "it is precisely this approximation which makes the fluctuations in the charge density uncorrelated in space - time rapidity .",
    "inclusion of these corrections will induce correlations .",
    "these correlations will however on the average not contribute to building up the charge density .",
    "it should be noted that there are other sources of correlation in longitudinal phase space .",
    "these arise from the classical field itself which is recomputed at each stage of the renormalization group analysis .",
    "although it is true that the source of the color field is largely uncorrelated , for a given source , there are still long range correlations built into the color field which would yield non - trivial multiplicity correlations in rapidity .",
    "since the process closes under iteration , it is sufficient for us to show how we integrate the degrees of freedom as the lagrangian changes scales in the nth to the n+1st step of the renormalization grouping .",
    "this is what will be demonstrated below .",
    "we begin our analysis with the mclerran - venugopalan action @xmath124 where @xmath125 we are of course working in @xmath43 gauge .",
    "now suppose we have a solution to the classical equations of the form @xmath126    it is understood in the above expressions that the longitudinal delta function ( as well as theta function ) is regularized on the scale @xmath127 . here",
    "@xmath128 is the typical longitudinal momentum of the fluctuations which have been integrated out in the previous step of the rg . at the very first step ,",
    "of course @xmath114 is the typical momentum associated with the nucleus or hadron .",
    "clearly , the knowledge of the precise structure of the charge density on the scales of order @xmath127 is necessary to determine the behavior of the classical solution at these scales .",

    "this is so even though we will integrate over the fluctuations in the entire momentum range @xmath129 where @xmath130 , but is still large enough so that @xmath131 ( here @xmath132 is evaluated at the scale @xmath133 and @xmath133 is assumed to be @xmath134 ) .",
    "the reason is that the dependence on the upper cutoff is only logarithmic , and the bulk of the contribution comes from much smaller momenta .",

    "we therefore have three types of fields to consider .",
    "there is the classical background field , the small fluctuation field at the scale of interest and the fields at lower momentum scale .",
    "we need only keep terms in the action which are at most quadratic in the small fluctuation field .",

    "the label @xmath138 refers to the @xmath139 step in the renormalization group procedure .",
    "this classical background field will be modified as the renormalization group procedure iterates .",
    "we will also write @xmath140 in this equation , as mentioned before the step function is a step function on distance scale larger than that which we have previously integrated out .",

    "the terms we neglected are suppressed by factors @xmath149 and are sub - leading in the small @xmath1 region .",
    "it is also understood that the transverse momenta of all the fields in eq .",

    "this is consistent with both , the bfkl approach , where all transverse momenta are roughly the same , and the leading log ( or double log at small @xmath1 ) altarelli - parisi evolution , where the momenta are bounded by the momentum of the external probe . by imposing such a cutoff",
    "we restrict ourselves to transverse momenta which are not parametrically large .",
    "this point can be appreciated by examining the feynman diagrams .",
    "consider for example the diagram that gives the leading correction to the distribution function beyond the classical field approximation .",
    "it is depicted in fig.[fig : twolegs ] .",
    "the corrections of this type with arbitrary number of insertions of the background field have been calculated in  @xcite . for our present purposes",

    "the propagator depends only on the minus component of the vector potential . on the classical solution discussed in the previous section ,",
    "this component vanishes .",

    "again , these corrections too are important at low transverse momentum .",
    "this point will be addressed in section [ sec : summary ] .    with these approximations",
    "the fluctuation propagator becomes very simple .",
    "the fluctuation of the charge density @xmath179 is time ( @xmath64 ) independent and local in the transverse directions @xmath180    note , that since our fields have a built in cutoff on the transverse momentum , the @xmath181 actually should be understood as averaged on a transverse scale size @xmath182 .",

    "in addition , the region of large @xmath0 where our classical methods no longer apply is probably correctly treated even though the derivation above breaks down . in this region , the fields are weakly coupled , and our expression derived by classical means appears to be correct even in this region , to leading order in coupling .",
    "the renormalization group equation may be formulated in the dglap form by first integrating over @xmath25 as @xmath210 it may be written in the bfkl - like form as @xmath211    note that this is a nonlinear equation .",
    "the dependence of its right hand side on @xmath133 is determined by the solution of classical equations .    at this point",
    "we want to return to discussion of the terms that we have neglected in deriving eq .",

    "those correspond to modifications of the gluon distribution due to mixing between the two particle and multi - particle ( higher twist ) operators .",
    "these diagrams can in principle be taken into account by using instead of the free propagator in eq .",
    "( [ deltachi ] ) the full propagator in the external field as calculated in  @xcite .",
    "although this calculation has yet to be performed , it is easy to understand qualitatively the main modifications it will bring about",
    ". first , even with the inclusion of the background field the additional charge density @xmath158 will remain static .",
    "this is due to the fact that all the internal lines in the diagram fig.[fig : hardlegs ] have the frequency ( @xmath212 ) of the order of the on - shell frequency corresponding to the longitudinal momentum @xmath213 .",
    "it is much smaller than the on - shell frequency of the external line with momentum @xmath115 . from the point of view of the emitted particle ,",
    "therefore the coupling is always to the static source .",

    "the density - density correlation which is given by the diagram fig.[fig : twolegs ] , in momentum space is a very slowly varying function of the transverse momentum at @xmath268 .",
    "it depends on the momentum logarithmically . in this range of momenta one",
    "can therefore approximate it by a constant .",
    "in our calculation precisely this is achieved by introducing the cutoff @xmath150 and using the eikonal approximation for the propagator @xmath269 , which results in a local correlator of density in the transverse coordinates . at momenta of order @xmath226",
    ", however the correlator changes rapidly . approximating it by a constant with some transverse cutoff should therefore result in an error of order one .",
    "a more careful treatment will bring about nontrivial transverse correlations of the charge density .",
    "one should therefore expect , that an improved treatment of low transverse momenta region will modify the distribution for density fluctuations such that nontrivial transverse as well as longitudinal correlations will appear .",

    "we believe , that although quantitatively it should be significant , the qualitative picture presented here will be confirmed .",
    "if the above issues can be answered in a satisfactory way , then one can proceed to a detailed computation of hadronic interactions within this approach .",
    "deep inelastic scattering from nuclei and drell - yan production in heavy ion collisions might be computed .",
    "the initial conditions for nucleus - nucleus collisions might be found in detail , the fluctuation spectra and correlations between fluctuations would also do much to verify the above picture .",
