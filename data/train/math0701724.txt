    "the theory of consensus or agreement problems for multi - agent systems has emerged as a challenging new area of research in recent years .",
    "it is a basic and fundamental problem in decentralized control of networks of dynamic agents and has attracted great attention of researchers .",
    "this is partly due to its broad applications in cooperative control of unmanned air vehicles , formation control of mobile robots , control of communication networks , design of sensor networks , flocking of social insects , swarm - based computing , etc .    in @xcite , vicsek et al .",
    "proposed a simple but interesting discrete - time model of finite agents all moving in the plane .",
    "each agent s motion is updated using a local rule based on its own state and the states of its neighbors .",
    "the vicsek model can be viewed as a special case of a computer model mimicking animal aggregation proposed in @xcite for the computer animation industry . by using graph theory and nonnegative matrix theory , jadbabaie et al .",
    "provided a theoretical explanation of the consensus property of the vicsek model in @xcite , where each agent s set of neighbors changes with time as system evolves .",
    "the typical continuous - time model was proposed by olfati - saber and murray in @xcite , where the concepts of solvability of consensus problems and consensus protocols were first introduced .",
    "the authors used a directed graph to model the communication topology among agents and studied three consensus problems , namely , directed networks with fixed topology , directed networks with switching topology , and undirected networks with communication time - delays and fixed topology . and it was assumed that the directed topology is balanced and strongly connected . in @xcite ,",
    "ren and beard extended the results of @xcite and presented mathematically weaker conditions for state consensus under dynamically changing directed interaction topology .",
    "in the past few years , consensus problems of multi - agent systems have been developing fast and many research topics have been addressed , such as agreement over random networks @xcite , asynchronous information consensus @xcite , dynamic consensus @xcite , networks with nonlinear consensus protocols @xcite , consensus filters @xcite , and networks with communication time - delays @xcite . for details , see the survey @xcite and references therein .    by long - time observation of animal aggregations , such as schools of fish , flocks of birds , groups of bees , and swarms of social bacteria ,",
    "it is believed that simple , local motion coordination rules at the individual level can result in remarkable and complex intelligent behavior at the group level .",
    "we call those local motion coordination rules _ distributive protocols_. in the study of consensus problems , they are called _",
    "consensus protocols_.    in the analysis of consensus problems , convergence rate is an important performance index of the proposed consensus protocol . in @xcite ,",
    "a linear consensus protocol was given and it was shown that the second smallest eigenvalue of interaction graph laplacian , called algebraic connectivity of graph , quantifies the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm . in @xcite , kim and",
    "mesbahi considered the problem of finding the best vertex positional configuration so that the second smallest eigenvalue of the associated graph laplacian is maximized , where the weight for an edge between two vertices was assumed to be a function of the distance between the two corresponding agents . in @xcite , xiao and boyd considered and solved the problem of the weight design by using semi - definite convex programming , so that algebraic connectivity is increased .",
    "if the communication topology is a small - world network , it was shown that large algebraic connectivity can be obtained @xcite .",
    "although by maximizing the second smallest eigenvalue of interaction graph laplacian , we can get better convergence rate of the linear protocol proposed in @xcite , the state consensus can never occur in a finite time . in some practical situations",
    ", it is required that the consensus be reached in a finite time .",
    "therefore , finite - time consensus is more appealing and there are a number of settings where finite - time convergence is desirable .",
    "the main contribution of this paper is to address finite - time consensus problems and discuss two effective distributed protocols that can solve consensus problems in finite times .",
    "furthermore , the method used in this paper is of interest itself , which is partly motivated by the work of @xcite , in which continuous finite - time differential equations were introduced as fast accurate controllers for dynamical systems , and partly by the results of finite - time stability of homogeneous systems in @xcite .",
    "the proposed protocols in this paper are _ continuous _ state feedbacks , but they do not satisfy the lipschitz condition at the agreement states , which is the least requirement for finite - time consensus problems because lipschitz continuity can only lead to asymptotical convergence . to prove that the two protocols effectively solve finite - time consensus problems , we adopt the theory of finite - time lyapunov stability @xcite .",
    "although for systems under general communication topology , it is difficult and even impossible to find the valid lyapunov functions , we have succeeded in reducing the general case into several special cases , in which appropriate lyapunov functions can be found .",
    "this paper shows that the convergence time is closely related to the underlying communication topology , especially , the algebraic connectivity for the undirected case . large algebraic connectivity can greatly reduce the convergence time .",
    "we also compare the convergence rates of two systems under the same protocol but with different protocol parameters and draw the conclusion that one converges faster when agents states differ a lot while the other converges faster when agents states differs a little .",
    "this conclusion encompasses the case when one of the two systems adopts the linear consensus protocol presented in @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to get shorter convergence time , we can change those adjustable parameters in the proposed protocols according to agents states . by the same method",
    ", we also study the case where the topology is dynamically changing .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the preliminary results in algebraic graph theory .",
    "section iii sets the basic setting in which the problem is formulated .",
    "the main theoretical results are established in section iv and the simulation results are given in section v. finally , concluding remarks are provided in section vi .",
    "in this section , we list some basic definitions and results in algebraic graph theory .",
