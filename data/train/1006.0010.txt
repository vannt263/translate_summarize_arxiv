    "the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite has a long history in nuclear physics .",
    "its virtues include applicability to many types of excitation across the isotopic chart , preservation of energy - weighted sum rules , and elimination of spurious motion .",
    "in addition , the qrpa has several appealing interpretations ; it is both a boson approximation for collective modes and the small - amplitude limit of the time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) approximation .",
    "its downside , traditionally , has been a limited ability to describe large - amplitude motion and complicated non - collective states , deficiencies that prompted the development of several more complicated methods , as , e.g. , in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "recent years , however , have seen a revival of the qrpa , despite its drawbacks .",
    "the primary reason is the increasing connection between nuclear mean - field theory and density - functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "the notion that hartree - fock or hfb calculations can be relevant beyond their naive range of validity has motivated attempts to describe a wide - range of nuclear properties in mean - field theory and extensions .",
    "the qrpa is the most straightforward extension that fits into the dft paradigm ; to the extent that the energy functional used in hfb calculations is exact , the qrpa provides the exact linear ( i.e.  small - amplitude ) response function in the adiabatic limit @xcite .",
    "combined with its other features , its connection with dft makes the qrpa an important tool in attempts both to develop a `` universal nuclear energy - density functional '' ( unedf ) , and to apply the functional to , e.g.nuclear astrophysics @xcite .",
    "the prototype energy - density functional is of skyrme form , corresponding roughly to effective interactions that have zero range , with derivatives simulating finite - range effects . in the last five or ten year",
    ", a number of groups have developed self - consistent ( q)rpa codes for use with these functionals or similar finite - range and relativistic versions , first in spherical nuclei , ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) , and then in axially symmetric deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "heavy deformed nuclei are still problematic , however . though the deformed rpa , without pairing , is now tractable in heavy nuclei @xcite , a separable approximation to the skyrme - qrpa equations has been applied in such nuclei @xcite , and efficient new methods for solving the full qrpa equations are promising @xcite , the numerical complexity of deformed systems has so far limited fully self - consistent skyrme - qrpa calculations to nuclei with @xmath8 . in this paper , we present a highly parallelized version of the skyrme qrpa that we are beginning to apply to heavy deformed nuclei . after discussing the structure of the code and demonstrating its accuracy",
    ", we present a preliminary application to the nucleus @xmath3yb .",
    "we focus on results here , postponing most of the formalism to a later publication .",
    "our qrpa code comes in several versions , developed successively as we progressed from tests in light nuclei to full - fledged calculations in heavy nuclei .",
    "all versions treat the entire skyrme + coulomb functional in a way that is completely consistent with hfb calculations ( restricted for the time being to `` volume '' pairing ) .",
    "in addition , all the versions preserve axial and parity symmetries and the time - reversal invariance of the ground state , and therefore require an hfb code that produces single - quasiparticle wave functions of the two variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 , with @xmath11 a good quantum number . finally , all diagonalize the traditional qrpa @xmath12 , @xmath13 matrix @xcite in the `` @xmath14-scheme '' , and use the rigid - rotor approximation @xcite , with the deformed qrpa solutions as intrinsic states , to calculate transition strength .",
    "the versions differ , however , in the basis in which the hfb equations are solved , in the basis in which the qrpa matrix is constructed , and in the way wave functions are represented numerically .",
    "version a ) takes quasiparticle - basis wave functions from the transformed - oscillator code hfbtho @xcite ( though we use the ordinary harmonic - oscillator basis ) , represents the wave functions on an equidistant mesh , and constructs the qrpa matrix in the quasiparticle representation .",
    "version b ) substitutes the vanderbilt `` cylindrical - box '' @xmath13-spline - based hfb code @xcite for hfbtho .",
    "version c ) modifies the qrpa part of version b ) by using the canonical - quasiparticle basis , represented with @xmath13-splines , in place of the quasiparticle basis to speed calculation and save memory .",
    "the vast majority of the computing time in all versions is in the construction of the qrpa matrix , each element of which requires a series of two - dimensional integrals for the skyrme interaction , and an additional multipole expansion for the coulomb interaction .",
    "the set of matrix elements can be divided among many thousands of processors so that the calculation is manageable on fast supercomputers .",
    "section ii below describes tests in relatively light systems .",
    "section iii presents an application to heavy nuclei .",
    "to display the accuracy of our codes , we show the results of several tests in nuclei with @xmath15 .",
    "we start with spurious states .",
    "a fully self - consistent and numerically perfect qrpa will completely separate spurious states from physical ones , and put them at zero energy .",
    "small numerical errors can spoil the treatment of spurious states , however , so any calculation that separates them well has passed a serious test .",
    "figure [ fig_nstr ] shows transition matrix elements of the number operators , @xmath16 with @xmath17 labeling excitations and @xmath18 protons / neutrons , to states with @xmath19 in a calculation of @xmath20 mg . to obtain the qrpa wave functions",
    ", we use version a ) of our code with the skyrme interaction skp @xcite , restricting ourselves to three harmonic oscillator shells . the hfb calculation yields pairing gaps of @xmath21 mev ( protons ) , @xmath22 mev ( neutrons ) and no quadrupole deformation in this small single - particle space .",
    "this result does not imply that a calculation in a larger space also gives @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "we use a small space to allow a complete qrpa treatment of two - quasiparticle excitations ; a full separation of the spurious @xmath24 strength associated with the particle - number violation requires no less .",
    "and we indeed achieve essentially perfect separation .",
    "the figure shows negligible strength to all excitations except the two spurious states , which come out at @xmath25 mev and 0.024 mev .",
    "next , we turn to spurious rotation , arising in the @xmath2 = 1@xmath5 channel . here",
    "the nucleus must be deformed .",
    "our hfb solution , again with skp but for @xmath28 mg in five oscillator shells , yields @xmath29 = 0.28 , @xmath30 = 0.034 mev , and @xmath31 = 0.131 mev . figure [ fig_jm1str ] displays the resulting transition strengths for the operator @xmath32 .",
    "most of the strengths are four order of magnitude smaller than that of the spurious state at @xmath6 = 0.045 mev .",
    "finally , we examine spurious translational motion . here , an oscillator basis for hfb is not optimal , and so we employ versions b ) and c ) of our code ( they give identical strength functions ) , which use wave functions in a large cylindrical box . for these calculations , in @xmath20 mg , we choose the box to have size @xmath35 = @xmath36 = 10 fm and use the skyrme functional sly4 @xcite .",
    "we take a pairing strength @xmath37",
    "= @xmath38140.348 mev @xmath39 and include quasiparticle states with energy @xmath40 300 mev in the density and pairing tensor .",
    "these parameters yield @xmath29 = @xmath380.27 , @xmath30 = 1.365 mev , and @xmath31 = 0.002 mev .",
    "figure [ fig_e1k0-str ] shows isoscalar ( is ) @xmath61 transition strengths , for which the excitation operator is @xmath41 , to states with @xmath34 .",
    "the figure contains two sets of lines , the second of which adds a correction term to the is operator ( via the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite ) to remove residual spurious strength from physical excitations .",
    "the difference between the two sets is very small in all the physical states shown , and completely negligible in higher - energy states . in sum",
    ", our code is accurate enough to handle spurious states in this mass region extremely well .",
    ".[tbl_e_str_jm ] comparison of energies and ( corrected ) is @xmath33 strengths for the three lowest - lying @xmath42 states in @xmath1o , calculated with spherical ( @xmath43-scheme ) code and the current ( @xmath14-scheme ) code and sly4 .",
    "the correction barely changes the strength for the two physical excited states , but reduces that of the spurious ( lowest ) state by many orders of magnitude .",
    "[ cols= \" > , < , > , < \" , ]     the accuracy of the energy - weighted sums in the @xmath19 and @xmath7 channels indicates that our approach is reliable for low - lying quadrupole shape vibrations .",
    "table [ tbl_be2 ] shows the energies and @xmath44 s of both the @xmath4-vibrational @xmath45 state and a low - energy @xmath2 = 0@xmath5 state with a significant @xmath46 that we denote by  @xmath29-vib \" .",
    "the quotation marks indicate that , unlike the clearcut @xmath4-vibrational state , the @xmath47 state has a somewhat smaller @xmath46 than is typical of vibrational modes .",
    "both states have been studied experimentally , e.g.  in ref .",

    ", width=302 ]    in summary , we have developed a box - based skyrme - qrpa code for axially - symmetric even - even nuclei aimed at calculations throughout the isotopic chart .",
    "we rigorously tested the accuracy of the code in mg isotopes , paying particular attention to spurious states .",
    "though the code does not do quite so well with spurious states in heavier nuclei under the restrictions on space size that we currently impose , the agreement of energy weighted sums with sum rules indicates that a ) in channels with no spurious modes ( e.g.@xmath56 ) our code is quite accurate , b ) in the @xmath19 channel , spurious admixtures are negligible , and c ) in the is @xmath2=@xmath52 , and @xmath53 channels ( and the @xmath57 channel in the future ) , admixtures are larger but can be effectively removed .",
    "in addition , calculations with larger spaces should be possible .",
