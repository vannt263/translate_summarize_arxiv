    "in this paper , we discuss a momentum - space , green s function , formulation of partial magnetic ordering . our study is motivated phenomenologically by the problem of high-@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite , where the superconducting phase appears in between anti - ferromagnetism ( af ) and the metallic phase .",
    "we ordinarily address magnetism ( other than through phenomenological models ) in terms of local models ( e.g. , the heisenberg model ) or hamiltonians ( e.g. , the hubbard model ) , which start from the picture that the electrons are almost localized at individual lattice sites . their interaction , e.g. , the @xmath3 term in the hubbard model , is written under this assumption .",
    "one fundamental problem which comes with this conventional approach is that when the magnetic order is weak and the electrons are relatively free , the assumption of locality is no longer viable .",
    "specifically , the @xmath3 term of the hubbard model is written in a spin - dependent form in accord with the pauli exclusion principle imposed on local wavefunctions .",
    "this is no longer the case when the wavefunctions are non - local .",
    "one would then ask , how would one formulate the origin of magnetic order , which is something that arises at the spatial scale of neighbouring lattice sites , in terms of something as delocalized as bloch waves .",
    "the answer is that we do nt .",
    "instead of having a full description of the short - range effects , we parametrize them in terms of the energy difference @xmath4 between the spin states , and one magnetic condensate : @xmath5 i.e. , the density of occupation of electrons with magnetically favourable spin , minus the density of occupation of electrons with magnetically unfavourable spin .",
    "@xmath6 is obviously a function of @xmath4 , and is , at least in principle , calculable for a given dispersion relation and total electron density . in later discussions",
    ", we shall omit the subscript @xmath7 ( which stands for ` ground ' ) and retain the subscript @xmath8 ( which stands for ` excited ' ) .",
    "thus @xmath9 @xmath10 is the average spin per unit cell and @xmath11 is the volume of a unit cell . for af , @xmath10 should be understood as referring to staggered spin .",
    "the interaction that is responsible for magnetic order is a short - distance and short - time effect , and is generally irrelevant when discussing long range effects .",
    "all that we require to know is how the condensate enters into the quantities that are relevant to the description of long - distance effects , in particular , the goldstone bosons which correspond physically to the magnons@xcite .",
    "the method by which we shall discuss the goldstone boson interaction is through the electron green s functions since , on one hand , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are related to the integrals of the electron green s functions and , on the other hand , the green s functions are constrained@xcite by ward  takahashi - like identities ( which , in the following , shall loosely be called the ward  takahashi identities ) through the requirement of spin current conservation .",
    "there is also a higgs mode , because the high - energy ( high - temperature ) restoration of spin symmetry implies the presence of a mode which becomes degenerate with the goldstone bosons in the limit of zero magnetic order .",
    "the case of fast ( large spin - wave velocity @xmath14 ) magnons with linear dispersion relation ( i.e. , like anti - ferromagnetism ) in three spatial dimensions is of special interest as a model case to illustrate our approach .",
    "when these conditions hold , we can write down a coupled system of gribov equations . a gribov equation @xcite is a non - perturbative self - consistency equation for the electron green s function , which sums the leading overlapping divergences ( which plague perturbation theory ) to all orders .",
    "we then solve the gribov equations .",
    "the solution exhibits singular behaviour of the form @xmath15 .",
    "we interpret this as an indication of the bosonic nature of the electronic excitations .",
    "there is , furthermore , an infinite tower , with equal separation , of such excitations .",
    "this is a hint of the presence of a geometrical string ( as opposed to the string - theory string which is a dynamical object with internal vibrational excitations ) of variable lengths .",
    "we do not know how to handle the more general case of magnons with arbitrary velocity , but the perturbative correction to the electron green s function is not singular at the thresholds in the limiting case of infinitesimally small spin - wave velocity .",
    "thus there is some transition from correlated to uncorrelated behaviour , depending on the value of @xmath16 , where @xmath14 is the magnon velocity and @xmath17 is some typical value ( @xmath18 ) of the electron velocity .",
    "the limit of fast magnons corresponds to the case where the vacuum responds collectively , and the electronic degrees of freedom is more aptly described as being due to string - like objects , whereas the limit of slow magnons corresponds to the case where the vacuum does not respond fast enough to cause significant alteration to the behaviour of individual electrons .",
    "let us turn our attention to the case of two spatial dimensions , still with linear dispersion relation for the magnons .",
    "since the infrared divergence is now stronger than in the case of three spatial dimensions , we expect the long - distance magnetic correlation effect to be quite radical and dominant when @xmath14 is large .",
    "superconductivity , in the form of electron pair condensation , thus requires @xmath14 to be small .",
    "we demonstrate that this is usually the case , unless magnetization @xmath10 is large , @xmath17 is small and the carrier density @xmath19 is small , i.e. , the system is near the mott insulator state .",
    "however , the simple exchange of magnons between electrons is unlikely to lead to pair formation . specifically , magnon exchange is attractive between electrons of opposite spin .",
    "thus spin singlet pairs can form , if the pair binding energy is greater than the energy that is required to flip the spin of one of the electrons .",
    "this spin flip goes against the magnetic order which is responsible for the appearance of the goldstone magnons which mediates the attractive interaction , and hence pair formation is unlikely . in short",
    ", we expect that the pair binding energy never exceeds the spin flip energy .",
    "on the other hand , this restriction may be lifted for the case of an electron which is borrowed from a neighbouring site . as an illustration ,",
    "the excitation of an @xmath20 electron with an up - type spin , let us say , ostensibly costs energy , but one may borrow an @xmath21 electron with an up - type spin from a site where up - type spin is favourable , i.e. , a site belonging to a different sub - lattice , at a lower cost in energy .    upon some reflection , we notice that such an effect is an instance of goldstone - boson condensation .",
    "this then causes an effective higgs ",
    "goldstone interaction which , in turn , makes the af ground state unstable against the formation of a superconducting condensate . in view of this , we propose that the analysis should proceed through the computation of the higgs boson green s function to all orders",
    ". the instability should then appear in the form of an imaginary part of the higgs boson green s function .",
    "the behaviour of the higgs boson green s function is then analyzed by summing the finite short - distance contribution to the self - energy to all orders using a dyson ",
    "schwinger formalism .",
    "this leads to an ordinary differential equation governing the behaviour of the self - energy as a function of the relevant higgs ",
    "goldstone three - point coupling .",
    "we solve this equation using a power expansion and borel summation .",
    "some words of caution are necessary here .",
    "first , an imaginary part of a green s function is ordinarily interpreted as leading to the decay of the particle .",
    "this is not the case here since there are no final state particles to which the higgs boson can decay .",
    "the higgs boson ostensibly decays into a collective state of goldstone ",
    "higgs mixture , or , the vacuum itself decays .",
    "second , the instability of the vacuum does not guarantee that the stable new vacuum is superconducting .",
    "this statement is quite true in general , but we find that the expression for the imaginary part of the green s function turns out to be of the following bcs - like @xcite form : @xmath22 @xmath23 is the 4-point interaction strength .",
    "@xmath24 is a suitable density of states .",
    "such an exponential form is expected in general in the case of pair - wise condensation , and hence we believe , even though this statement may not be rigorous , that the ground state is superconducting .",
    "third , it may appear strange that the formation of superconducting pairs ( which have charge @xmath25 ) may be described by an imaginary part of the higgs boson green s function , when the higgs boson is an object without electric charge .",
    "the point here is that the goldstone  higgs mixing represents the movement of electrons between the sub - lattices , and hence what we are summing to all orders is actually the behaviour of the electronic condensate . in other words ,",
    "a higgs boson is not an exciton - like electron ",
    "hole object but the fluctuation in the number density of electrons .",
    "fourth and last , when we discuss short - distance physics , we should in general be wary of the effect of short - distance interaction which , as we discussed earlier , are hidden and neglected",
    ". however , this applies primarily to the electrons , and not to the goldstone and higgs bosons which are collective excitations .",
    "furthermore , the short - distance contributions which we are summing to all orders are not necessarily as short as the neighbouring lattice sites .",
    "the calculated mean - magnetization dependence of the energy gap is consistent with the observed doping dependence of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 in high-@xmath0 compounds .",
    "our analysis suggests the co - existence of partial af order with superconductivity in the under - doped region .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "in this section , we adapt gribov s analysis of axial current conservation @xcite to the context of spin current conservation in systems with partial magnetic order .    consider the fermionic ( quasi-)electron field which is an su(2)@xmath26 doublet @xmath27 let us define the four - vector currents .",

    "@xmath4 depends on the energy @xmath42 in principle . in particular , at the threshold , @xmath51 would , in general , have a singular structure corresponding to the emission and absorption of the goldstone boson @xmath1 through the process @xmath54 .",

    "however , the calculation is messy , and it can depend on the threshold behaviour of @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath4 .    a simpler and more intuitive way to obtain the spin - wave velocity , for a given form of the dispersion relation , is to equate the excitation energy @xmath103 of the @xmath104 magnon mode with the excitation energy of @xmath21 to @xmath20 at @xmath104 , because these are equivalent .",

    "the above discussion is for the case of fast magnons with linear dispersion relation in three spatial dimensions .",
    "this case is special in that the leading overlapping divergences can be dealt with by using the gribov equation framework .",

    "first , we do not know what the situation may be with respect to changing the linear dispersion relation to a quadratic dispersion relation .",
    "second , the infra - red divergence is stronger in 2-d .",
    "we thus expect the long - distance correlations to be even more dominant than in the 3-d case . on the other hand , we know that there is no long - distance correlation in the 1-d case because of the strong quantum fluctuations . our intuitive guess ( which is only a wild guess ) is that the string picture is valid both for 3-d and 2-d , because the string is a one - dimensional object which can be embedded in both 3-d and 2-d .",
    "the 1-d case is obviously different in this picture .",
    "third and last , let us consider the case of very slow magnons .",

    "this finding , that @xmath205 , and @xmath115 by a similar calculation , are almost independent of @xmath39 , is quite intuitive .",
    "a slow magnon field tends to stay fixed at a point in space - time , and therefore its interaction is independent of @xmath43 .",
    "when @xmath115 is independent of @xmath43 , there is no divergence at thresholds ( which depend on @xmath43 ) and , equivalently , no singularities at thresholds in @xmath42 .",
    "the divergent integral of eqn .",
    "( [ eq : electron_self_energy_slow ] ) can therefore be treated as a constant to a good approximation .",
    "this gives rise to the renormalization of @xmath209 .",
    "@xmath4 is unaffected , and therefore there are no other corrections to @xmath115 at any order ( consider the dyson  schwinger equations ) .",
    "the above argument is for the limiting case of zero spin - wave velocity .",
    "this is also intuitive from considering the bcs theory , where the electron - pair interaction is governed both by the coupling constant and the cut - off at the debye frequency @xmath210 which corresponds to @xmath211 in the above case .",
    "there is no superconductivity in the limit of zero @xmath210 .",
    "what , then , will be the case when @xmath211 is small but non - zero ?",
    "we shall argue in the next section that even in that case , we can not have electron - pair formation due to magnon exchange .",
    "therefore electrons remain more or less free .",
    "note that the formation of an electron - pair condensate should reflect in the electron green s function through its imaginary part ( and possibly also the real part ) .",
    "thus , at least for the case of linear spin - wave dispersion relation , the behaviour of the electrons changes qualitatively depending on whether the spin - wave velocity is fast or slow .",
    "for fast magnons ( @xmath212 ) , the response of the ( magnetic ) vacuum is fast and collective , and the electrons are under its influence . for slow magnons ( @xmath213 ) , the response of the vacuum is slow and partial , and the electrons move around more freely .",
    "these results are quite intuitive , because according to eqn .",
    "( [ eq_linear_spin_wave_velocity ] ) , @xmath14 is large when @xmath10 is large and @xmath19 is small .",
    "if the electron dispersion relation goes as @xmath214 , one can see that the @xmath215 when @xmath216 is small and @xmath10 is large . in other words , the case of fast spin - wave velocity occurs only near the mott insulator state or some such state with large @xmath10 and small electron velocity .",
    "spin - wave velocity is slow when @xmath10 is small , i.e. , when the magnetic order is broken , so that the electrons move around more freely .",
    "since high-@xmath0 cuprates are to a good approximation 2-d systems with af interaction , let us focus on the case corresponding to these conditions .",
    "we saw at the end of the previous section how electrons start to become more free when the magnetic order is weakened .",
    "we then consider how superconducting pairs may be formed .    in the exchange of a magnon between two electrons ,",
    "the interaction is attractive between @xmath21 and @xmath20 , but is repulsive between @xmath21 and @xmath21 , or @xmath20 and @xmath20 .",
    "this implies that for the formation of an @xmath217 pair , the binding energy must exceed @xmath4 , as otherwise there is insufficient energy to excite @xmath21 to @xmath20 .",
    "but it would be unnatural that the interaction strength is so large as to allow such pairs to form .",
    "for instance , the bcs binding energy is expected to be less than the cut - off energy ( the debye frequency in bcs theory ) which is given by @xmath4 .",
    "if such an interaction arises at all , it can only be due to something like overscreening , and this circumstance is more naturally associated with sdw ( spin - density wave ) or some such magnetic structure .",
    "we thus believe that superconductivity through magnetic exchange occurs through a different mechanism , and this is through , let us say , the mixing between the two ( e.g. , spin - up and spin - down ) sub - lattices that constitute the af ground state ( but note that a completely analogous argument can be made for ferromagnetism : this argument is not specific to af ) .    through this mechanism ,",
    "it is possible to ` borrow ' an @xmath20 electron from a neighbouring site to form spin - singlet pairs without paying the excitation energy @xmath4 .",
    "let us estimate the size of the superconducting gap due to this mechanism , using the bcs expression quoted in the introduction ( eqn .",
    "( [ eqn_electron_magnon_delta_naive ] ) ) : @xmath218 where @xmath23 is the effective 4-point interaction strength , and is estimated by @xmath219 times some function @xmath220 of a ` mixing - angle ' for the ` mixing ' between the borrowed electrons and the initial electrons .",
    "the cut - off , @xmath221 , is estimated by @xmath4 .",

    "altogether , we thus expect @xmath223 the expression which we shall obtain later on corresponds to @xmath224 , up to a possible constant factor .",
    "this is the number density of higgs bosons if the chemical potential were exactly at the excitation energy of a @xmath225 higgs boson .",
    "there is one conceptual problem with this approach , namely that this mixing between the sub - lattices is not an electronic excitation but essentially an alteration of the af ground state , in the sense that the flipping of the spin due to this effect is associated with the local modification of the vacuum from , say , @xmath226 to @xmath227 , where @xmath78 is an order parameter . in other words ,",
    "the phenomenon that we are describing here is , we believe , goldstone - boson condensation .",
    "what we need to discuss then is the stability of the af ground state after goldstone - boson condensation has taken place .",
    "this instability appears via the higgs ",
    "goldstone coupling which is due to the mixing of the goldstone boson with the higgs boson",
    ". this mixing is , as we shall see , a direct consequence of the goldstone - boson condensation .",
    "a physical picture for this effect is as follows . in the af state ,",
    "moving an electron to its neighbouring site , without disturbing the af order , requires flipping the spin of the electron .",
    "this takes place via the emission of a magnon .",
    "however , moving the electron without raising it to the spin - excited state corresponds to the higgs boson , and so the higgs boson couples to the goldstone boson , or there is effectively a mixing between the higgs boson and the magnon .",
    "we know how one might go about calculating this effect , but the full description is cumbersome , and we shall parametrize it by an effective mixing angle @xmath228 .",
    "this allows us to calculate the corrections to the higgs boson green s function .      in our picture ,",
    "goldstone - boson condensation by itself costs energy , which is compensated by the superconducting condensation energy .",
    "@xmath1 condensation can at least formally be parametrized by a negative @xmath1 mass squared @xmath229 .",
    "this leads to the mass matrix : @xmath230    but a goldstone boson is necessarily massless , and so the physical modes are obtained by rotating @xmath1 and @xmath2 by a mixing angle @xmath231 such that @xmath1 becomes massless .",

    "the exchange of goldstone magnons induces non - analyticity in the higgs - boson green s function .",
