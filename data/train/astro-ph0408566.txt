    "the w49 giant molecular cloud extends more than 50  pc in diameter and weighs in at @xmath7 m@xmath8 @xcite , the most massive in our galaxy outside of the galactic center .",
    "embedded within this cloud , w49a is one of the most luminous galactic giant radio h  ii regions ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the w49a star - forming region lies in the galactic plane at a distance of 11.4@xmath101.2 kpc @xcite , has @xmath1140 well studied uc  hii regions ( e.g. depree et  al . 1997 ) , associated with a minimum of that number of central stars earlier than b3 @xcite .",
    "about 12 of these radio sources are arranged in the well known welch `` ring '' @xcite .",
    "a few other young galactic clusters have a large number of massive stars , e.g. , the carina nebula ( e.g. rathborne et  al . 2002 ) , ngc  3603 ( e.g. drissen et  al .",
    "1995 ) , and the arches cluster ( e.g. figer et  al .",
    "2002 ) , or are very young , e.g. ngc  3567 @xcite , w42 and w31 ( e.g. blum et al . 2001 ) but no other known region has a large number of massive stars in such a highly embedded and early evolutionary state . for this reason w49a is unique in our known galaxy .",
    "our images contain many stars along the line of sight , but we can use the reddening within the galactic disk to our advantage .",
    "we identify a stellar population associated with the w49a region by first selecting objects with @xmath12 colors red enough to be consistent with a distance of @xmath13  kpc along the galactic plane , estimated by assuming an exponential distribution of galactic dust .",
    "we arrive at a@xmath14 and @xmath15 ( rieke  &  lebofsky  ( 1985 ) reddening law ) .    to get an unbiased luminosity function for the stars associated with w49 , so we select an extinction - limited sample of stars , with limits set by the extinction and completeness limits ( see homeier & alves 2004 ) as the sample suffers from severe non - uniform extinction , we corrected for this effect assuming an intrinsic color of @xmath16 .",
    "this was chosen based on the knowledge that all stars without hot dust are intrinsically nearly colorless in the near - infrared , with @xmath12 ranging from 0.0 to 0.3 .",
    "we expect objects associated with the w49a star - forming region to be early - type stars with intrinsic @xmath12 near 0.0 , whereas giant stars should have intrinsic @xmath12 up to 0.3 .",
    "we convert the extinction - limited extinction - corrected @xmath17 luminosity function for our entire field into a mass function by transforming each magnitude bin to a mass .",
    "the relationship between mass and absolute magnitude is taken from the @xmath18  yr isochrones of lejeune  &  schaerer ( 2001 ) .",
    "we extrapolated the magnitude - mass relation to infer masses for the most luminous stars , which are more luminous than the 120  m@xmath4 models .",
    "the error in the slope is large and there are many sources of uncertainty in our measurement , but we can say that we do not see evidence for a top - heavy imf . we find a mass function slope of @xmath19 , which is consistent with salpeter .",
    "we estimate the total stellar mass of the w49a star cluster by counting stars with masses greater than @xmath20  m@xmath4 and using a salpeter slope , with upper and lower mass limits as 120  m@xmath4 and 1  m@xmath4 . for cluster  1 ,",
    "we find 54 stars within @xmath21 , implying a total mass of @xmath22  m@xmath4 . in our entire field , we count 269 stars with masses @xmath23  m@xmath4 , implying a total mass of @xmath24  m@xmath4 .",
    "the stars we have identified as massive stars are certainly contaminated by background obejcts , but we are also certainly incomplete in our census of massive stars due to extinction and angular resolution . even if the stellar mass estimate for w49a is a factor of 2 too high , w49a is as or more massive than any known young galactic star cluster .",
    "it is important to note that this is a _ lower limit _ to the final stellar mass , as there is circumstantial and direct evidence for ongoing star formation in this region",
    ". there is abundant molecular gas , and hot cores near the ring of uc  hii regions @xcite .",
    "we obtained @xmath26 adaptive optics imaging observations with naco on the vlt of the @xmath27 ( 3pc@xmath283pc ) region surrounding the cc object @xcite , which is appears to be a single ( to 600  au ) massive star , @xmath25 m@xmath4 , ionizing a compact hii region .",
    "our objective is to search for the occurence of low - mass star formation in the vicinity of this high mass star . to accomplish this",
    ", we look for evidence for clustering of sources with extinction consistent with association with the w49a star - forming region .",
    "we find tentative evidence for an excess of sources within @xmath29  pc of the cc star , however , this is a work in progress and needs to be mroe carefully examined for the statistical significance .",
    "the radius of the compact hii region surrounding the cc star is @xmath30  pc .",
    "our naco nir images show that the hii region has broken out of the confining material on the eastern side .",
    "we detect diffuse emission extending away from the star and hii region , which is most likely due to strong nebular lines of h in the @xmath31 and @xmath17 passbands .",
    "this is supported by the 3.6 cm radio observations by de  pree et  al . (",
    "1997 ) , in which the ionized gas shows the same morphology .",
    "this ionized emission extends over 10 times the radius of the hii region , to @xmath32  pc .",
    "some of the nir sources associated with w49a were detected by conti & blum ( 2002 ) , but they did not have a large enough fov to identify a nir cluster with the radio hii region .",
    "our observations clearly show a massive star cluster adjacent to the uc  hii regions ( 2  pc distant ) @xcite .",
    "this means that the w49a region began forming stars earlier than previously thought , and that the ultra - compact hii  regions which have been long - known to radio astronomers are not the first generation of massive stars .",
    "we use these data to estimate a total stellar mass of @xmath33  m@xmath4 .",
    "since molecular gas is abundant , this is a lower limit to the final stellar mass of the cluster . with these observations ,",
    "w49a joins the list of galactic giant radio hii regions with the coexistence of two or more phases of massive star formation .",
    "this means that the formation of massive stars in clusters is not completely synchronized , but there is some spread in age .    what does the core of cluster  1 hold",
    "given the high internal extinction , we are certainly incomplete in our near - infrared census of star formation and therefore any mass or density estimates .",
    "the core is very crowded ; high spatial resolution observations are needed .",
    "taken at face value and without correcting for the large extinction , the cluster core appears to be significantly less dense than the arches , ngc  3603 , or 30  doradus . if it is truly less dense , then the different formation environment of w49a may be an important clue for understanding the processes which drive clustered star formation .",
    "the subclustering phenomenon is useful in describing the star formation pattern in the w49a molecular cloud .",
    "when the cloud has ceased forming stars , the resulting stellar group will likely be called a cluster , but at the time of current observation , the massive star formation does not appear to be distributed uniformly throughout the region , or with a radial dependence relative to a cluster center. rather it is better described as occuring in subclusters. in this sense we could count @xmath34 subclusters within @xmath35  pc using the combined nir and radio observations : cluster  1 , the ( welch ) `` ring '' of uc  hii regions , w49a south , the rq complex , and perhaps the cc source .",
    "we speculate that star formation within a subcluster is essentially synchronized , and a massive star cluster is a collective of several ( or many ) subclusters .",
    "there is also evidence for subclustering in lower - mass star - forming regions @xcite , which can be reproduced in star formation simulations @xcite .",
    "possible examples of subclustering in extragalactic star clusters are : ssc - a in ngc  1569 and ngc 604 in m33 .",
    "ssc - a in ngc  1569 has a stellar concentration with red super giants and another with wolf - rayet stars .",
    "the massive stars in ngc 604 are certainly subclustered , but the region itself it is of sufficiently low density to be termed a scaled ob association ( soba ) rather than a star cluster @xcite .",
    "the applicability of the subclustering description to other young massive galactic star clusters remains to be seen , but we conclude that it is a useful concept to describe and understand massive star formation in w49a ."
