    "in the last few years , the study of topological degrees of freedom has become one of the most actively pursued topics in condensed matter physics . in terms of materials ,",
    "this stream of researches has been triggered by the discovery of the two dimensional ( 2d ) topological insulator ( ti ) , the hgte / cdte quantum well,@xcite and followed by the outbursting discovery of various 3d ti crystals starting with bi tellurides ( selenides).@xcite these materials have non - degenerated spin - polarized dirac fermion bands on their surfaces,@xcite which are protected by the time - reversal symmetry . in the 2d case",
    ", these bands correspond to quantum spin hall ( qsh ) states , which bear important potentials for spintronic applications and the quantum computing.@xcite    in sharp contrast to various different types of 3d ti materials discovered , 2d material systems to realize the qsh state have been extremely limited to hgte / cdte and inas / gasb.@xcite moreover , while the existence of metallic edge states was confirmed directly by spin- and angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) for 3d ti s , no such study is available for 2d ti s ; the qsh states of hgte and inas were revealed only by the transport measurements.@xcite in this respect , recent progress in the growth and characterization of one bilayer ( bl ) bi(111 ) films , which were theoretically suggested as a 2d ti,@xcite deserves particular attention.@xcite so far , the arpes and transport measurements on this film could only probe the bulk 2d property without providing any information on the edge electronic state,@xcite which is the essential feature of 2d ti , due to the extremely low density of edges in the film .",
    "on the other hand , a very recent scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and sts study claimed that the edge - localized density of states ( dos ) of a bi(111 ) bl island were resolved.@xcite however , the dos enhancement itself was marginal and the corresponding energy was not clearly separated from other spectral features nor consistent with the calculation based on a freestanding bi layer .",
    "more importantly , a strong hybridization of the electronic bands of the bi bl and the substrate , bi@xmath0te@xmath1 , was observed in both arpes and first - principles calculations to drive the bl apparently _",
    "metallic_.@xcite therefore , _ the ti nature of the bi bl film grown on bi@xmath0te@xmath1 is not clear _ at present .    in this paper , through stm , sts , and arpes measurements and extensive first - principles calculations , we investigated the electronic states of bi(111 ) one bl islands with well - defined zigzag edges grown on fresh cleaved surfaces of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se .",
    "the strong interaction between the bi layer and the substrate is unraveled .",
    "the calculation reveals that the topological edge state ( tes ) of the bi bl is preserved even after the the strong hybridization with the substrate , which replaces the band gap of the pristine bi bl with a small hybridization gap .",
    "this gap , playing an important role to make the epitaxial bi(111 ) bl a 2d ti , is confirmed by the sts measurements .",
    "more importantly , the edge electronic state was clearly distinguished from other spectral feature of the bi(111 ) bl including the characteristic interfacial states , in good quantitative agreement with first - principles calculations for a bi(111 ) bl film and bl nanoribbons on top of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se .",
    "we suggest that the edge enhanced sts feature observed previously could be due to the edge modulation of the interfacial state.@xcite this work makes clear the 2d ti nature of a bi(111 ) bl on a _ strongly interacting substrate _ of a 3d ti bi@xmath0te@xmath1se and opens up the possibility for microscopic studies of a quantum spin hall channel .",
    "the present system is also unique due to the coexistence of the 2d and 3d topological insulators in proximity although its implication is largely unknown .",

    "single crystals were cleaved in uhv , and well ordered surfaces were confirmed by atomically resolved stm measurements .",
    "our sts ( @xmath7 ) curves for the cleaved surface of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se are fully consistent with the previous work.@xcite ultrathin bi(111 ) films were grown at room temperature by evaporating bi from a knudsen cell and samples were cooled down to @xmath878 k for stm and sts measurements .",
    "topography imaging was performed at several sample biases and currents , mainly 1 v and 100 pa .",
    "sts spectra were acquired using the lock - in technique with a bias - voltage modulation of 1 khz at 1030 mv@xmath9 and a constant tunneling current of 0.81na .",
    "the energy band positions of both the substrate and the bi(111 ) films were determined by arpes measurements using xe discharge radiation ( 8.4 ev ) and a high performance hemispherical electron energy analyzer ( gamma - data , sweden ) .",

    "we used the experimental lattice constant of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se , 0.436 nm.@xcite the bi(111 ) and three bi@xmath0te@xmath0se qls were relaxed fully . in order to investigate edge states",
    ", we carried out similar calculations for bi(111 ) bl nanoribbons ( bnrs ) of different widths with zigzag edges on top of a three - ql - thick bi@xmath0te@xmath0se slab .",
    "the thickness is not thick enough to secure the topological surface state of bi@xmath0te@xmath0se but affects little the electronic structure of the bi(111 ) bl on top and its interaction with the substrate as confirmed by the calculations with a thicker film .",

    "2(c ) , 2(d ) and 3 , the degenerate valence bands and conduction bands of bi(111 ) bl are split due to the inversion symmetry breaking by the interaction with the substrate .",

    "our calculations reproduce clearly the edge - state bands , whose dispersion is surprisingly consistent with that of a free - standing bi(111 ) bl qualitatively.@xcite the overall band dispersion , the dirac cone at the zone boundary and the helical spin texture of the edge states are preserved while its energy shifts substantially to a higher binding energy by about 0.3 ev .",
    "this shift reflects the formation of the new hybridization gap ; the cbm shifts from @xmath170.5 to @xmath170.15 ev and the edge state emerges from this new cbm .",
    "the energy shift is crucial to locate the edge state in the experiment as discussed below .",

    ". however , even for the floating bl , the edge state dos at this energy is very low .",
    "moreover , for the epitaxial bl , this energy is well out of the band gap due to the closing of the original gap and the formation of the hybridization gap .",

    "could be reproduced in the present measurement as the intensity modulation of @xmath15 , the interfacial state .",

    "the strong interfacial interaction with the substrate induces a large splitting of the degenerate valence bands of bi(111 ) and the band hybridization with those of the substrate .",
    "the hybridization leads to the formation of a characteristic interfacial state and a small hybridization energy gap above the fermi level for the bi film .",
    "irrespective of such a strong interaction with the substrate , the band inversion of the bi film and the edge state are shown to be robust .",
    "the edge state along the zigzag edge exhibits a substantial energy shift .",
    "this edge state signature was unambiguously resolved in the sts spectra and spatial maps . the interfacial state is also affected near the edges , which were misinterpreted as the sign of the edge state in the previous work.@xcite while our work may represents the clear real space observation of the edge electronic state of a 2d ti , which corresponds to a qsh state , the topological or helical nature of the edge state has to be confirmed further , for example , by a spin - polarized tunneling experiment.@xcite microscopic understanding of the nature of the edge states will help explore exotic low dimensional physics such as the helical luttinger liquid and emerging physics from the coexistence of the 2d and 3d ti with their 1d and 2d tes s in proximity",
