    "the properties expected of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) neutrinos make them attractive targets for probing the high - energy universe . unlike the highest energy photons and cosmic rays , a flux of neutrinos will not seriously suffer attenuation either at its source or during propagation .",
    "being uncharged , the paths of neutrinos will remain unbent by galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields , so any detected neutrino should point back to its source .",
    "additionally , any uhe neutrino flux should be very sensitive to the nature and evolution of the sources of the highest energy cosmic rays , providing a powerful discriminant between models of uhe cosmic ray production @xcite .",
    "the lunar cherenkov technique is a method by which uhe neutrinos may in principle be detected .",
    "@xcite described how a particle cascade in a dense medium produces coherent cherenkov radiation .",
    "if the medium is transparent at radio frequencies , the radiation can escape and be detected remotely as a narrow pulse of a few nanoseconds duration , corresponding to decimetre and greater wavelengths .",
    "the lunar regolith ( the outer layer of pulverised rock on the moon s surface ) is such a radio - transparent medium , and as suggested by @xcite , observations of the moon with ground - based radio - telescopes can be used to search for cascades produced by uhe neutrino interactions .",
    "this technique works in principle for both uhe cosmic rays and neutrinos , although formation - zone effects are expected to significantly reduce the cosmic ray signature @xcite . at uhe",
    "the neutrino - nucleon cross section is such that neutrinos traversing the lunar diameter are severely attenuated .",
    "together with subsequent shower and cherenkov emission geometry , and refraction at the lunar surface , this causes ghz - regime cherenkov signals to appear to originate almost entirely from the limb of the moon .",
    "the first attempt to use the lunar regolith in the search for uhe neutrinos was made at parkes , australia by @xcite .",
    "the 64-m parkes radio telescope was used to observe the moon for approximately 10.5 hours using a wide - bandwidth dual - polarisation receiver .",
    "no real events could be identified .",
    "subsequently , two independent experiments utilising the technique also recorded null results , the first by @xcite being the goldstone lunar ultra - high energy neutrino experiment ( glue ) that ran from 2001 - 2003 at nasa s goldstone deep space communications complex , usa , and the second by @xcite conducted from 2002 to 2004 at the kalyazin radio astronomical observatory , russia .",
    "importantly , both groups developed detailed simulations of the technique ( see , respectively , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these were used to place limits on the uhe neutrino flux , with the published glue limit producing severe constraints on z - burst uhe neutrino production models @xcite .",
    "the search for uhe neutrinos now encompasses a wide range of experiments , including the anita balloon experiment @xcite , low - frequency lunar observations with westerbork and lofar @xcite , and the pierre auger air - shower array @xcite .",
    "though no uhe neutrinos have so far been detected , limits placed on the uhe neutrino flux from various experiments , in particular the anita - lite limit @xcite , have already ruled out the more optimistic z - burst models , and severely constrained the remainder .    to ensure continuing competitiveness with these other efforts , future lunar cherenkov observations should aim to utilise ` next generation ' radio - telescopes , in particular those designed as large arrays of smaller stations with broad - bandwidth receivers such as the planned ska ( square kilometre array ; @xcite ) , as discussed by @xcite . in order to improve real - time discrimination of cherenkov pulses from background noise and terrestrial radio - frequency interference ( rfi )",
    ", the full capabilities offered of such instruments in nano - second pulse detection will have to be exploited .",
    "this will require the latest in signal processing technology .",
    "in parallel , sophisticated simulations should be used to optimise observation parameters such as frequency , beam pointing position , and bandwidth . a first step in this process",
    "is an analysis of the broad - bandwidth techniques developed at parkes , the effectiveness of which we present here .",
    "the experiment at parkes is described more fully by @xcite .",
    "observations were on the nights of 16@xmath0 , 17@xmath0 , and 18@xmath0 of january , 1995 . at the time of observation ,",
    "the significant limb - brightening effect had not been predicted and , unfortunately , only 2 hours out of the total 10.5 hours of observation time were spent pointing at the lunar limb .",
    "the remaining 8.5 hours , spent pointing at the centre , are not expected to contribute significantly to the sensitivity , as the entire limb was then outside the fwhm of the parkes beam ( @xmath1 at the central frequency of 1.5 ghz ) .    in the experiment ,",
    "data from two polarisation channels ( lcp and rcp ) for a 500-mhz band centred at 1.425 ghz were recorded .",
    "triggering required a coincidence between two 100-mhz bandwidth sub - bands , centred at 1.325 and 1.525 ghz , extracted from either the lcp or rcp channel . the ionospheric delay between these sub - bands ( estimated at 10 ns )",
    "was corrected for by artificially delaying the 1.525 ghz sub - band .",
    "triggering occurred when the individual voltages in both the sub - bands simultaneously exceeded an @xmath2 level ( eight times the measured standard deviation of the oscilloscope voltage ) for between 7.5 and 20 ns .",
    "this produced a trigger event approximately every two minutes .",
    "the recorded data were processed to remove dispersion within each band .",
    "this also helped filter out terrestrial interference , which experiences no ionospheric delay ( except any signals bounced off the moon , which experience twice the dispersion ) . pulses of coherent cherenkov radiation were expected to be both 100% linearly polarised ( and thus be received equally in both the lcp and rcp channels ) and broad - band ; these properties have since been verified in a series of experiments @xcite .",
    "the recorded data enabled candidate events to be tested for all these criteria , assuming a dispersion in the range of zero to twice that expected , a process which eliminated all of the @xmath3700 triggered events .",
    "thus it was concluded that no cherenkov pulse had been observed .",
    "only two 100mhz sub - bands could be used to form the trigger due to the limitations of signal processing technology in the mid 90s , where , ideally , the full 500mhz bandwidth with dual polarisation would have been used .",
    "this proved to be the limiting sensitivity as the remaining data ( not used in triggering ) proved more than adequate for discriminating rfi and thermal fluctuations . to demonstrate the usefulness of improved technology",
    ", it is useful to speculate about what the parkes sensitivity might have been had the entirety of both data streams been de - dispersed in real - time and used to form a trigger .",
    "a proper estimate requires a knowledge of the precise effect of dedispersion on the amplitudes of rfi , which was responsible for the observed trigger rate and the setting of the @xmath2 level .",
    "a conservative estimate , however , for the sensitivity can be obtained by assuming an identical trigger rate due to rfi , knowing that de - dispersion will act to reduce the amplitudes of the ( undispersed ) rfi signals .",
    "therefore , we also present results for an otherwise identical parkes experiment in which a signal strength of @xmath2 in both of the full 500 mhz bands is required for detection .",
    "it should be possible to reduce this down to a @xmath4 level on each channel in coincidence , which is the requirement to eliminate events from normally distributed thermal noise with 99.98% confidence at 1 ghz sampling over a 10.5 h period .",
    "a monte carlo program was created to simulate the interactions of uhe neutrinos with the moon , the production and propagation of coherent cherenkov radiation , and the reception and triggering of the signal by the parkes antenna .",
    "the program instantiates similar physics to the programs developed for the glue and the kalyazin experiments . for uhe neutrinos at discrete energies a lunar impact parameter , @xmath5 ,",
    "was sampled from @xmath6 for @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the lunar radius .",
    "the proportion of neutrinos detected by the simulated experiment was recorded and used to give an estimate of the detection probability per incident neutrino as a function of neutrino energy . to estimate the effective experimental aperture ,",
    "the detection probability was multiplied by the physical lunar aperture ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 km@xmath11-sr ) .",
    "both charged - current ( cc ) and neutral - current ( nc ) interactions of uhe neutrinos were modelled , with energy - dependent cross - sections taken from @xcite .",
    "these interactions may initiate two kinds of showers .",
    "electromagnetic showers consist entirely of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and are initiated only by the @xmath14/@xmath15 produced in a @xmath16/@xmath17 cc - interaction , ( bremsstrahlung photons from the @xmath18/@xmath19 produced in @xmath20 cc - interactions will be of insufficient energy to begin detectable cascades ) .",
    "hadronic showers develop from both cc and nc interaction and consist of a hadronic core surrounded by an electromagnetic component ( see @xcite for a discussion of the relationship between cherenkov radiation and shower phenomenology ) . the interaction inelasticity , @xmath21 ( fraction of neutrino energy given to hadronic showers ) , was sampled from the distributions used in @xcite . in the case of @xmath22/@xmath17 cc interactions , where both electromagnetic and hadronic showers are present , only the shower with the strongest emission at a given angle to the shower axis was taken into account , because the relative phase between the two components is unknown .",
    "neutrinos and anti - neutrinos were treated identically , as were @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "one in three incident neutrinos was assumed to be a @xmath16/@xmath17 as we expect complete flavour mixing during oscillation over extragalactic distance scales @xcite .",
    "the lunar density was modelled with five distinct density layers , with the densities of the inner four normalised so as to produce the correct lunar mass as in @xcite .",
    "the outer shell  nominally the regolith  was modelled with 10 m depth , for consistency with both the simulations used by @xcite and the results of radar and optical studies discussed by @xcite .",
    "a density of @xmath25 g/@xmath26 , and refractive index @xmath27 , was used for consistency with the cherenkov parameterisations of @xcite .    of these layers , only the regolith was treated as a suitable medium for the production of coherent cherenkov radiation because of its known low attenuation at radio - frequencies .",
    "it appears reasonable to assume that the mega - regolith  a layer of ejecta blankets between the regolith and underlying bedrock in the lunar highlands , distinguished from the regolith as outlined by @xcite , with an expected mean depth of @xmath28 kms @xcite  may also exhibit low radio - attenuation properties .",
    "this region is treated by @xcite as an extended regolith down to 500 m depth .",
    "detailed modelling of the production of cherenkov radiation and radio - transmission through these surface layers of the moon , including the depth dependence of their electromagnetic properties , is left to a future paper .",
    "neutrino interaction points were considered as point sources of cherenkov radiation , with the cherenkov cone axis being in the direction of the incoming neutrino .",
    "previous simulations @xcite parameterized this radiation according to the results of @xcite and @xcite in ice and scaled these results to the regolith according to the prescription of @xcite . recently , @xcite obtained results for purely electromagnetic showers by simulating the regolith directly , using a refractive index of @xmath27 , density @xmath29 g/@xmath26 , radiation length @xmath30 g / cm@xmath11 , and critical energy @xmath32 mev ( below which ionisation losses dominate bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "the value of the field strength at the cherenkov angle was fitted as : @xmath33    for shower energy @xmath34 ( tev ) , frequency @xmath35 ( ghz ) , and observation distance ( i.e.  earth - moon distance ) @xmath36 ( m ) .",
    "the decoherence frequency @xmath37 ghz , and the scaling parameter @xmath38 , have both been revised by @xcite from their former values of @xmath39 ghz and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "notably , the normalisation of @xmath41 is approximately @xmath42% lower than the simple scaling relationships @xcite would suggest , implying that the glue and kalyazin apertures were over - estimated , particularly to lower neutrino energies ( as discussed in sec .  [ results ] ) .",
    "away from the cherenkov angle , @xcite found the simple scaling relationships to be adequate to model the decoherence .",
    "however , these authors note the new parameterisation for radiation far from the cherenkov angle is unreliable for shower energies at which the landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect becomes important .",
    "this effect suppresses both the bremsstrahlung and pair - production cross - sections when the characteristic length of the interaction becomes comparable to distance between scattering centres ( the atoms in the medium ) , and is important at particle energies above the lpm energy , @xmath43 . for the regolith , @xmath43@xmath44770 tev , which covers",
    "the entire uhe range , and therefore this new parameterisation for angular spread will be inappropriate for cascades initiated by uhe neutrinos .",
    "simulations are currently in progress with showers in regolith for shower energies above the lpm energy . in the meantime , we have used eqn .",
    "[ peak ] to describe the peak field strength at the cherenkov angle for electromagnetic showers , and take the angular dependence of purely electromagnetic showers from @xcite , with the addition of the @xmath45 term from @xcite .",
    "the characteristic width @xmath46 we assumed to scale with @xmath47 ( @xmath48 the radiation length ; @xmath49 g / cm@xmath11 here ) .",
    "thus we assume the cherenkov cone to be approximately 3.4 times as wide in the regolith as in ice .",
    "the cherenkov radiation from hadronic showers is derived almost entirely from electromagnetic sub - showers resulting from @xmath50-decay into @xmath12-rays .",
    "because of the similar phenomenology , the peak pulse strength for hadronic showers can be derived by multiplying the purely electromagnetic result , eqn .",
    "[ peak ] , by an energy - dependent correction function , which is approximately the fraction of energy going into electromagnetic sub - showers @xcite .",
    "originally calculated for cascades in ice , the medium - dependence of this function has yet to be investigated , and so to calculate the peak pulse strength for hadronic showers we used it unmodified with the electromagnetic result for the regolith described above .",
    "the cone - width for hadronic showers was also taken from @xcite , extrapolated above 10 eev as per @xcite , and scaled to the regolith as with the electromagnetic shower width .    in the monte carlo code the cherenkov emission is represented as bundles of `` rays '' , each ray having associated with it a direction , solid angle , field strength and polarisation .",
    "ray - tracing was used to propagate the radiation to earth , at distance @xmath51-m .",
    "modelled effects included the electric - field attenuation length @xmath52 in the regolith ( @xmath53-m at 1 ghz ; @xmath54 ) , refraction at the lunar surface using the fresnel transmission coefficients for each component of the polarisation , and the solid - angle - stretching factor applicable to a point source .",
    "surface roughness was simulated by randomly deviating the local surface normal from the perpendicular .",
    "the deviation angle ( the adirectional slope ) was calculated by generating the slope tangents ( unidirectional slopes ) in orthogonal directions , which are gaussian - distributed with mean 0 and variance @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the rms surface roughness used in @xcite .",
    "this accounted for large- scale surface roughness , such as hill - sides and crater walls , with dimensions larger than the shower size .",
    "the effects of intermediate - scale surface roughness , on scales between the wavelength and shower size , is not currently understood sufficiently to be included .",
    "as with previous simulations , dispersion in the ionosphere was assumed negligible within each 100 mhz sub - band , and the height of the pulse was calculated by summing the contributions across the bandwidth .",
    "the signal was assumed to retain its 100% polarisation , and thus be received with 50% power efficiency by each of the circularly - polarised receivers . as lunar thermal emission was the dominant source of noise , the ratio of total signal ( true uhe neutrino signature plus a random noise component ) to mean thermal noise is preserved by the electronics ; hence , detection could be determined without the need to simulate the response of the parkes receiver system .",
    "this simplification is justified by the low background noise recorded when pointing off the moon .",
    "the simulation was run for energies in the range @xmath57-@xmath58 ev .",
    "the calculated aperture for both centre - pointing and limb- pointing configurations of the parkes experiment is plotted in fig .  1 , together with the simulation results for the glue experiment .",
    "no aperture has been published for the kalyazin experiment which had a threshold of 13,500-jy .",
    "however , the simulation results of @xcite , in which an otherwise identical experiment with an assumed threshold of 3,000-jy is modelled , have been included , together with estimates for the improved parkes experiment described in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] .    in comparing the apertures , note that the parameters we used to simulate the parkes experiment , such as depth of regolith , amplitude of cherenkov radiation , and mean surface roughness , are at least as pessimistic as those of either @xcite or @xcite .",
    "furthermore , perhaps because of parameter differences , these two previous simulations produce apertures which differ by an order of magnitude at @xmath59 ev , as first noted in @xcite .",
    "this is surprising , firstly because of the similarity of the modelled experiments , as opposed to the actual experiments , and secondly because the greater difference is at high energies where naively one would expect the results to be less sensitive to differences in the modelling .    in more detail ,",
    "consider lowering the simulated signal strength by 10% .",
    "this will produce a much lower effective aperture to neutrinos near the threshold energy for neutrino detection , where all simulated detections are marginal .",
    "however , a neutrino of @xmath60 times this energy will produce a coherent cherenkov signal with @xmath61 times the power , so that simulated detections include only a very small fraction of marginal events .",
    "hence , the effect of lowering the modelled signal strength will be relatively smaller for higher energy neutrino events .",
    "this is why the calculated apertures have a stronger energy dependence at low neutrino energies : the parkes limb aperture at @xmath62 ev is 13.8 times that at @xmath63 ev , but the aperture to @xmath58 ev neutrinos is only 3.9 times that at @xmath59 ev ( noting that a factor of 2.3 per decade arises naturally from the increasing neutrino cross - section ) .",
    "[ apertures ]    putting these concerns aside , fig .",
    "1 clearly demonstrates the benefits of the wide - bandwidth system used at parkes .",
    "the effective energy threshold of @xmath64 ev for the limb - pointing configuration is similar to that achieved by both glue ( which utilised two antennae ) and kalyazin ( basing this on the simulation of @xcite , which assumed a sensitivity of 3,000-jy instead of the eventual 13,500-jy ) . above threshold energies , the parkes aperture consistently lies below that from glue and above that of kalyazin , a comparison which could only be improved by the use of identical simulation methods .",
    "an unambiguous result is the desirability of pointing at the limb .",
    "compared to the limb - pointing , the centre - pointing configuration of the parkes experiment exhibits an order of magnitude higher effective energy threshold ( @xmath65 vs @xmath66 ev ) , and even at @xmath59 ev the effective aperture is less than half that at the limb .",
    "this effect was partially off - set in the glue experiment by defocussing the 70-m dish when not pointing at the limb , which accounts for the smaller difference in apertures between configurations at @xmath62 ev . for experiments utilising lower frequencies and smaller dishes ,",
    "in which the fwhm of the beam is comparable to , or greater than , the apparent size of the moon , the effect will likely be negligible .",
    "the importance of developing signal processing techniques is shown by the lower detection threshold and greater aperture which would have resulted if the experiment at parkes had been able to utilise all available data in forming a trigger .",
    "as expected , the difference is most pronounced at low energies , with the increased sensitivity effected by the use of a wider bandwidth in triggering shifting the effective aperture to the left .",
    "methods to increase the aperture at higher energies include the use of multiple beams to cover the entire limb , and/or smaller antennas to cover the entire moon with a single beam .",
    "these will be discussed in a future paper the effect of the lower observation frequency at parkes is also evident . as discussed in detail by @xcite ,",
    "cherenkov radiation escapes the moon more readily at low frequencies , and the increase in beam size also allows more of the moon to be observed .",
    "the disadvantage is a lower sensitivity because the cherenkov signal is weaker at low frequencies , and the lower noise power per beam solid angle from lunar thermal emission is mostly offset by the increased beam size .",
    "the result is a steeper increase in aperture with energy as is evident from fig .  1  at @xmath63 ev , the parkes aperture is 1.5 times that of beresnyak s result for kalyazin , whereas at @xmath59 ev it is three times larger .    the limit on the uhe neutrino flux we derive for the parkes experiment is plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "the contribution from the 8.5 hours spent pointing at the lunar centre is negligible and , with only 2 hours of useful limb observations , the uhe neutrino flux limit from the parkes experiment is much weaker than that from either the kalyazin experiment ( 31.3 h @xcite ) or goldstone experiments ( 73.45 h limb , 40 h half - limb @xcite ) .",
    "we have calculated the effective aperture of the parkes experiment , and found that in the limb - pointing configuration it was a competitive experiment as the exposure to uhe neutrinos per hour of observation time was greater than the single - dish experiment at kalyazin , and it achieved an effective neutrino detection energy threshold equal to that of the two - telescope experiment at goldstone .",
    "unfortunately , the centre - pointing configuration , where most of the observation time was spent , had negligible sensitivity at all but the highest energies .",
    "the resulting limits on the uhe neutrino flux from the present parkes experiment are therefore not competitive with those from either glue or kalyazin .",
    "clearly , using the broad - band techniques at parkes with modern signal processing technology would greatly improve the sensitivity of future searches for lunar cherenkov emission , even without improved rfi discrimination .",
    "this could be provided by utilising multiple antennas , as in glue , or by using intelligent hardware which incorporates the discriminants currently used in off - line processing into a real - time trigger .",
    "future experiments should aim to use both .",
    "the next generation of radio - telescopes , such as lofar and the ska , both of which will use large arrays of antennae linked by high speed connections , will prove ideal instruments for the uhe neutrino search , and may give the best chance to detect these elusive particles .",
