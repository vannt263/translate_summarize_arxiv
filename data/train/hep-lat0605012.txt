    "in two seminal papers svetitsky and yaffe have tentatively linked the finite - temperature phase transitions in ` hot ' gauge theories to the simpler order - disorder phase transitions of spin models @xcite . in the general case",
    "their conjecture may be stated as follows : the effective theory describing finite - temperature yang - mills theory with gauge group @xmath3 in @xmath4 dimensions is a spin model in @xmath5 dimensions with a global symmetry group given by the centre @xmath6 of the gauge group .",
    "a somewhat stronger version of the conjecture can be formulated if the phase transitions in questions are of second order . in this case",
    "yang - mills theory and spin model fall into the same universality class and the critical exponents coincide .",
    "this has been convincingly demonstrated for @xmath7 @xcite in @xmath8 .",
    "however , continuous phase transitions in hot gauge theories are not generic and hence the universality statement is almost empty  at least in 3 + 1 dimensions @xcite . on the other hand , the more general version of the statement has already been used by svetitsky and yaffe to argue that the phase transition for @xmath9 yang - mills theory must be first order for @xmath8 as there is no @xmath0 rg fixed point in this case . since then",
    "this has been firmly established by a number of lattice calculations @xcite .",
    "the conjecture implies that the effective theories may be formulated as ` polyakov loop models ' @xcite . for @xmath3",
    "this means that the macroscopic dynamical variables have to reflect the complete gauge invariant information contained in the ( untraced ) polyakov loop , which in lattice notation is given by @xmath10 \\equiv \\prod_{t=1}^{n_{\\tau } } u_{t,{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath$x$}};0 } \\ ; .\\ ] ] this is a temporal holonomy winding around the compact euclidean time direction of extent @xmath11 . for gauge groups with nontrivial centre the traced polyakov loop , @xmath12 with the trace being taken in the defining representation for the ease of later notation . ]",
    "serves as an order parameter for the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the phase transition goes along with spontaneous breaking of the centre symmetry resulting from _ non - periodic _ gauge transformations under which @xmath13 the deconfined broken - symmetry phase at sufficiently large wilson coupling @xmath14 is characterised by @xmath15 ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "recently it has been found that gauge groups with trivial centre may also lead to a deconfinement transition depending on the _ size _ of the gauge group @xcite .    at this point",
    "the choice of dynamical variables needs to be addressed . under",
    "_ periodic _ gauge transformations @xmath16 the holonomy ( [ eq : utrpoldef ] ) transforms as @xmath17 which leaves its eigenvalues and , as a consequence , its trace ( [ eq : trpoldef ] ) invariant .",
    "the eigenvalues are permuted arbitrarily by gauge transformations corresponding to weyl reflections @xcite .",
    "this invariance is taken into account by constructing symmetric polynomials in the @xmath18 eigenvalues . from unimodularity the product of the eigenvalues",
    "is @xmath19 and there are only @xmath20 independent polynomials , for example the traces @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "these in turn are in one - to - one correspondence with the characters of the @xmath23 fundamental representations ( see below ) .",
    "hence , for @xmath7 @xmath24 ( which is real ) is sufficient while @xmath9 requires @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the latter being a linear combination of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "only for @xmath28 traces of higher powers of @xmath29 are needed as independent dynamical variables @xcite .",
    "in two recent papers @xcite we have studied polyakov loop models on the lattice for the simplest non - abelian gauge group @xmath7 .",
    "the models have been derived using strong - coupling techniques at small wilson coupling @xmath30 and a newly developed inverse monte carlo ( imc ) method which works for arbitrary values of @xmath30 .",
    "the latter method allows for a mapping of yang - mills theory at a certain value of @xmath30 to any appropriately chosen polyakov loop model of the form @xmath31 where the summation is over nearest neighbours and group representations @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the group character @xmath34 is the trace of the polyakov loop in representation @xmath32 , @xmath35 \\equiv { \\text{tr}}_i \\ , { \\mathfrak{p}_{{\\mbox{\\footnotesize\\boldmath$x$ } } } } \\ ; .\\ ] ] all characters @xmath34 are polynomials in the characters corresponding to the fundamental representations . for @xmath7",
    "the simplest model is of ising type , @xmath36 as first suggested in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the output of the imc routines are the @xmath30-dependent effective couplings @xmath37 . even without particular knowledge of these",
    "one may study the models ( [ eq : polmodel ] ) in their own right as statistical field theories .",
    "the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture may then be utilised to deduce information about the yang - mills phase transition .",
    "for @xmath7 we have been able to show that the mean - field analysis of the effective models yields a surprisingly good agreement with the monte carlo analysis of both the model itself and the underlying yang - mills dynamics .",
    "it should be stressed at this point that the models ( [ eq : polmodel ] ) are not just simple scalar field theories with a linear target space as all characters ( [ eq : chars ] ) take values in a compact space parametrised by the @xmath38 fundamental characters .",
    "hence , in the lattice path integral each lattice site is endowed with the reduced haar measure on the gauge group rather than a lebesgue measure .",
    "this paper presents our first steps to generalise the results of @xcite to the gauge group @xmath9 .",
    "we label the characters by two integers @xmath39 and @xmath40 which count the numbers of fundamental and conjugate representations ( ` quarks ' and ` antiquarks ' in the @xmath9 flavour language ) required to construct the representation @xmath41 .",
    "equivalently , these integers characterise the horizontal extensions of @xmath9 young tableaux ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pq ] ) .     character labels and @xmath9 young tableaux . ]    under the @xmath0 centre transformations the characters transform according to the rule @xmath42 so that the most general centre - symmetric effective action with nearest - neighbour interaction may be written as @xmath43 = \\sum_{\\substack{{\\langle}{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath$x$ } } { \\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath$y$}}{\\rangle } , \\ ,",

    "localised at single sites .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec",
    ": sce ] we confirm the ansatz ( [ eq : ssu3 ] ) by means of a strong coupling ( small-@xmath30 ) expansion for @xmath47 $ ] . for a restricted set of couplings ( and hence representations )",
    "we investigate the resulting @xmath0 models by minimising the classical action ( section  [ sec : qca ] ) followed by an improved mean field analysis in section  [ sec : mf ] . in agreement with the svetitsky - yaffe conjecture",
    "we find a first order phase transition from the symmetric to a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "our improved mean field analysis already reveals an interesting phase structure with four different phases : two distinct ferromagnetic phases , one symmetric and one anti - ferromagnetic phase . besides the first order transitions we detect second order transitions from the symmetric to an anti - ferromagnetic and to a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the continuous transition from the symmetric to the anti - ferromagnetic phase is to be expected since the models reduce to the @xmath48-state potts model for polyakov - loops having values in the centre of the gauge group .",
    "section  [ sec : mcsim ] contains the results of our extensive monte carlo simulations performed on a linux cluster where we have implemented the powerful package jenlatt .",
    "similarly as for @xmath7 the mean field and numerical results are in surprisingly good agreement .",
    "this is presumably due to the existence of ( three ) tricritical points .",
    "depending on the order of the transition we localise the critical lines with either a metropolis , a multicanonical or a modified cluster algorithm .",
    "in addition we have checked that the critical exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 at the second order transition to the anti - ferromagnetic phase agree with those of the @xmath48-state potts model in @xmath48 dimensions .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : so ] we wrap up with discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly recapitulate the strong - coupling ( small-@xmath30 ) expansion for the @xmath9 wilson action at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "it is known that the leading order result ( @xmath49 ) stems from ladder diagrams that wind around the temporal lattice extension and corresponds to an ising type model analogous to ( [ eq : su2ising ] ) . by going beyond the leading order we will encounter higher group representations / characters and",
    "hence have an independent confirmation of the ansatz ( [ eq : ssu3 ] ) for the effective action .",
    "our starting point is the standard wilson action , @xmath50 where the summation over plaquettes contains both temporal and spatial links .",
    "the effective action @xmath51 $ ] is introduced as usual by inserting an appropriate ( group valued ) delta function in the path integral , @xmath52 } \\\\    & \\equiv   \\int { \\mathfrak{dp}}\\ , e^{-{s_{\\text{\\tiny eff}}}[{\\mathfrak{p } } ] } \\ ; . \\end{split}\\ ] ] while it is not known how to perform the final integration analytically for the full wilson action one can straightforwardly integrate order by order in @xmath30 .",
    "thus we expand the boltzmann weight @xmath53 and integrate separately over temporal and spatial links , @xmath54 . adopting temporal gauge",
    "we set all temporal links equal to unity apart from the links in the first timeslice which according to ( [ eq : utrpoldef ] ) may be identified with the polyakov loop . integrating out all spatial link variables we obtain the partition function @xmath55 \\right ) \\ ; , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where we have introduced the operators @xmath56 .",
    "the effective action may finally be written as @xmath57 where the coefficients @xmath58 are related to the operators @xmath59 via the linked - cluster theorem . in the remainder of this section we are going to determine the explicit form of the effective operators @xmath58 .",
    "we first rewrite the wilson - boltzmann weight ( [ eq : boltzmann1 ] ) as @xmath60 and expand the single - plaquette contribution in terms of @xmath9 characters , @xmath61 with @xmath62 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pq ] ) .",
    "all @xmath30 dependence now resides in the generalised fourier coefficients @xmath63 which accordingly may be further expanded , @xmath64 an explicit computation of the @xmath65 shows that these vanish whenever the representation labels become sufficiently large , namely if @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this yields the important intermediate result that to any given order @xmath67 in the strong - coupling expansion only a _ finite _ number of characters contributes , @xmath68 the integrations over the spatial links are standard group integrals which can be found in the texts @xcite .",
    "the upshot is that only connected link arrangements ( ` polymers ' ) wrapping around the temporal extent of the lattice yield nonvanishing contributions . the leading term is a ladder diagram consisting of @xmath69 plaquettes",
    "each of which contributes a factor of @xmath30 implying a total contribution of @xmath70 .",
    "the associated operator is explicitly found to be @xmath71 a typical operator of order @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 in terms of which the wilson - boltzmann weight ( [ eq : boltzmann2 ] ) becomes @xmath74 expanding this to next - to - leading order ( @xmath75 ) yields the simple expression @xmath76 note , however , that some care has to be taken in interpreting products such as @xmath77 which by also contain disconnected pieces . upon expanding the logarithm by means of the linked - cluster theorem we are led to keep only connected contributions of the form @xmath78 making use of the character reduction formula @xmath79 products of characters at the same site may be reduced to single characters . as a consequence ,",
    "the connected part of ( [ eq : s2n ] ) takes the explicit form @xmath80 for what follows it is useful to introduce the short - hand notation @xmath81 with the obvious term - by - term identifications as compared to ( [ eq : effactionlong ] ) .",
    "our conventions are such that all couplings in ( [ eq : effactionlong ] ) and ( [ eq : effactionshort ] ) are real functions of @xmath30 , the single leading one being @xmath82 ( as noted already in @xcite ) while the subleading ones are @xmath83 .",
    "it is straightforward to include higher - order terms the number of which increases rapidly . at order @xmath84 ,",
    "for instance , there are already 11 terms so that we refrain from going beyond next - to - leading order in @xmath30 .    for later purposes it is useful to express the operators appearing in ( [ eq : effactionshort ] ) in terms of the fundamental loops @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "octet and sextet characters ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively ) are eliminated via the standard reduction identities @xmath89 which are equivalent to the character relations ( recall that @xmath90 ) @xmath91 making use of the latter the different terms in ( [ eq : effactionshort ] ) become @xmath92 from these expressions it is obvious that each operator @xmath93 is manifestly real . under charge conjugation @xmath94 ,",
    "hence @xmath95 , whereupon all terms in @xmath96 are charge conjugation invariant as required @xcite .",
    "note that the orders included correspond to terms that are quadratic , cubic and quartic in @xmath85 and/or @xmath86 .",
    "higher powers will arise upon taking into account higher representations .",
    "thus , in this respect @xmath97 is somewhat singled out being of only cubic order .",
    "this will become important in a moment .",
    "it has already been pointed out by svetitsky and yaffe @xcite that effective actions with @xmath0 centre symmetry are closely related to the 3-state potts model which shows a first order phase transition from a symmetric to a ferromagnetic phase @xcite . to make the relation manifest we restrict the polyakov loop to the centre elements",
    "@xmath98 introduced in ( [ eq : centre ] ) .",
    "setting @xmath99 we find the general formula @xmath100 where @xmath101 denotes the dimension of the representation @xmath41 , @xmath102 applying this to the effective action in ( [ eq : effactionshort ] ) we find , up to an additive constant , @xmath103 =    \\lambda \\sum _ { { \\langle}{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath$x$ } } { \\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath$y$ } } { \\rangle}}\\cos \\left (    \\frac{2\\pi}{3}(k_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath$x$ } } } - k_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath$y$ } } } ) \\right ) \\ ;    ,   \\quad k_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath$x$}}}\\in\\{0,1,2\\}\\ ; , \\label{eq : pottsm}\\ ] ] with effective coupling @xmath104 the action ( [ eq : pottsm ] ) is precisely the one of the 3-state potts model @xcite .",
    "we thus expect that our effective polyakov loop models will have a phase structure generalising the one of the 3-state potts model .",
    "the latter is known to have a ferromagnetic phase for large negative @xmath105 and an anti - ferromagnetic phase for large positive @xmath105 @xcite . as a preparation for the discussion of later sections it is hence useful to obtain some qualitative understanding of the phase structure of the polyakov loop models viewed as generalisations of the 3-state potts model . for the reason mentioned at the end of the previous section we choose as a minimal generalisation the following effective action , @xmath106 which in terms of the fundamental loops may be written explicitly as @xmath107 note that there are also quadratic contributions stemming from @xmath97 .",
    "the action ( [ eq:2cmodel ] ) is manifestly @xmath0 centre symmetric under @xmath108 .",
    "it is important to realise that ( [ eq:2cmodel ] ) differs from the standard lattice actions for scalar fields in several respects .",
    "first , the field @xmath24 is dimensionless , being the trace of a unitary matrix .",
    "this allows for the presence of cubic hopping terms connecting neighbouring sites .",
    "even more important is the fact that the target space of @xmath24 is compact . introducing the eigenvalues of @xmath109 via @xmath110 and writing @xmath111",
    "we find for the real and imaginary part of @xmath85 , @xmath112 the target space of @xmath85 may then be sketched in the complex @xmath85-plane ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : domain ] ) .",
    "the boundary corresponds to the points with @xmath113 , the singular ` corners ' being given by the three centre elements @xmath114 .",
    "target space of the polyakov loop @xmath85 in the complex @xmath85-plane .",
    "the corners represent the three centre elements .",
    "the intermediate points ( denoted anti - centre elements ) will also become relevant for the discussion of the phase structure . ]",
    "let us try to get some first rough idea of the phase structure associated with the two - coupling model ( [ eq:2cmodel ] ) in the @xmath115-@xmath116 plane by looking at the extrema of the classical action . if we vary the couplings these will trace out a certain ( possibly discontinuous ) trajectory in the target space given by the triangle of fig .",
    "[ fig : domain ] .",
    "as we argued earlier , for centre - valued polyakov loops the effective action ( [ eq:2cmodel ] ) reduces to the action of the potts model ( [ eq : pottsm ] ) with coupling @xmath117 .",
    "thus we expect a ferromagnetic phase ( f ) for large negative @xmath118 and an anti - ferromagnetic phase ( af ) for @xmath118 large and positive . in a region around the origin in the coupling plane entropy",
    "dominates energy and we can not expect to actually obtain the correct phase - structure in this region by purely classical reasoning based on minimising the energy . qualitatively we expect a symmetric phase in a neighbourhood of the origin .",
    "this is represented schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : clphases ] by the central rectangle .    in order to study the ordered phases ( in particular af ) we divide the lattice in two sub - lattices ( denoted ` even ' and ` odd ' ) where the polyakov loop takes values @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "two nearest neighbours belong to different sub - lattices .",
    "the absolute minima of the classical action @xmath121 will then be located at certain values @xmath122 and @xmath123 of the polyakov loop which are identified with its ` expectation values ' .",
    "we trust this reasoning as long as we are sufficiently far from the origin of the coupling plane i.e. from the disordered , entropy - dominated phase .",
    "any _ ferromagnetic _ ordering will be characterised by a minimum with @xmath124 while in an _ anti - ferromagnetic _ phase @xmath125 .",
    "quite interestingly we find two distinct ferromagnetic phases , one for which the polyakov loop is near a centre element or @xmath126 in the vicinity of @xmath127 and a different ferromagnetic phase with @xmath126 taking values near the intermediate points marked by triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : domain ] .",
    "we call this an _ anti - centre _ phase ( ac ) .",
    "we expect a phase transition line separating the ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic phases at vanishing potts - coupling @xmath118 .",
    "the resulting qualitative phase diagram is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : clphases ] .     qualitative prediction of the phase diagram in the coupling constant plane for the effective action ( [ eq:2cmodel ] ) .",
    "the ferromagnetic ( f ) , anti - centre ( ac ) and anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) phases are obtained by looking for classical minima .",
    "the symmetric , disordered phase ( s ) is located where entropy is expected to dominate over energy . ]    to discuss the ferromagnetic phases it suffices to minimize the action ( [ eq : smin ] ) with @xmath128 , in which case @xmath129 this can be done analytically . to localise the anti - ferromagnetic phase we have calculated the absolute minima of ( [ eq : smin ] ) on the target space depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : domain ] numerically .",
    "the combined analytical and numerical results are summarised as follows .",
    "for negative @xmath116 we have a transition @xmath130 while for positive @xmath116 there is a richer structure , @xmath131     behaviour of the order parameter @xmath132 defined in ( [ eq : defprojector ] ) as a function of @xmath115 for fixed @xmath133 . for comparison",
    "we have added the result from the mean field analysis to be developed in the next section . ]",
    "the behaviour of a suitably projected order parameter @xmath132 ( the precise definition of which will only be needed later on ) for positive @xmath133 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : classicafer ] . upon inspection one",
    "notes that for @xmath115 sufficiently negative the system starts out with the polyakov loop at a centre element .",
    "increasing @xmath115 beyond @xmath134 the order parameter drops monotonically until , at a critical coupling @xmath135 , there is a jump to the ac phase with @xmath126 near a anti - centre element .",
    "the jump of @xmath132 is due to a centre - transformation and does not imply that the polyakov loop itself jumps . indeed , @xmath136 changes smoothly and arrives at an anti - center element for @xmath137 .",
    "the system stays there until @xmath138 , where it jumps again , this time to the af phase .",
    "as expected , we see no symmetric phase in a purely classical analysis .",
    "actually , for @xmath139 there is just no symmetric phase .",
    "the next step of refinement to be presented in this section is a mean field ( mf ) analysis of the effective action ( [ eq:2cmodel ] ) .",
    "this will serve as a basis for a comparison with results from direct monte carlo simulations to be discussed later on .",
    "due to the peculiarities of the model as compared to standard scalar field theories the application of the mf approximation is not entirely straightforward . for the benefit of the reader",
    "we will set the stage by giving a brief outline of the necessary modifications .",
    "for further details the reader is referred to our earlier paper @xcite . to keep the discussion sufficiently general",
    "we will first treat the effective action ( [ eq : effactionshort ] ) with five couplings focussing on simpler examples later on .",
    "we are interested in expectation values which are computed by evaluating integrals of the form @xmath140 } \\int \\mathcal{d}{\\mathfrak{p}}\\ ,    e^{-{s_{\\text{\\tiny eff}}}[{\\mathfrak{p } } ] } \\ , a[{\\mathfrak{p } } ] \\ ; , \\\\",

    "we solve the variational problem ( [ eq : definfimum ] ) on the space of product measures with fixed expectation values of the characters .",
    "this is done by introducing appropriate lagrange multipliers @xmath153 . for ferromagnetic systems",
    "one may assume that the weight functions @xmath154 at each site are identical , @xmath155 .",
    "this assumption corresponds to a translationally invariant ground state .",
    "according to the discussion of the previous section we expect anti - ferromagnetic phases and hence we must refine our choice for @xmath154 .",
    "we therefore introduce different weight functions on the even and odd sub - lattices , respectively , @xmath156 defining the sign of a lattice point as @xmath157 as a consequence , expectation values of characters will subsequently have two values depending on the sub - lattice where they are evaluated , @xmath158 the sources are taken constant as well when restricted to the even and odd sub - lattices , @xmath159 or @xmath160 , respectively . like the characters the sources are complex .",
    "the action couples only nearest - neighbour sites so that its expectation value entering ( [ eq : definfimum ] ) may be written as @xmath161 with @xmath162 denoting the lattice volume in @xmath5 spatial dimensions .",

    "for instance , by varying @xmath177 with respect to @xmath178 we obtain @xmath179 where we have used that the current is given as @xmath180 the first term in ( [ eq : distrsolution ] ) derives directly from the effective action ( [ eq : effactionshort ] ) and hence contains four couplings to which the potential coupling @xmath181 has to be added .",
    "a complete mf analysis of this system becomes very awkward . in what follows ,",
    "we therefore specialise to effective actions with only one or two couplings .",
    "the action ( [ eq : s10 ] ) defines what we call the ` minimal model ' with one coupling only , @xmath182 identifying @xmath183 and inserting ( [ eq : sgp ] ) the mf potential simplifies to @xmath184 it is useful to define the generic mf potential @xmath185 so that ( [ eq : simplesolution_2 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath186 this expression clearly shows that for negative @xmath105 configurations with @xmath187 are favoured making the distinction between even and odd sub - lattices obsolete . the remaining unique expectation value",
    ", @xmath188 thus serves as an order parameter for the ferromagnetic phase transition . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath189 @xmath119 and @xmath120 will cease to be positively correlated and we expect an anti - ferromagnetic phase transition . in this case , a reasonable order parameter is given by @xcite @xmath190 let us also introduce the absolute values of the order parameters , henceforth denoted by @xmath191 if we assume for the moment that the occurring phase transitions are second order the corresponding mf critical couplings can be computed analytically as we are going to demonstrate next .",
    "the consistency condition reduces for the case at hand to @xmath192 as both @xmath119 and @xmath120 may be assumed small near the critical coupling @xmath193 the corresponding sources will also be small .",
    "thus , we may expand @xmath194 which again holds separately on each sublattice , @xmath195 and @xmath196 . plugging this into yields @xmath197 and hence the critical couplings @xmath198    for arbitrary order parameters we have solved the gap equations ( [ eq : gap ] ) numerically .",

    "the contradiction will be finally resolved by monte carlo simulations showing that near the f - ac transition the peaks of the probability distribution for @xmath215 are off the real axis . apart from this fairly small region in parameter space",

    "we have performed a large number of monte carlo simulations to quantitatively check the mf predictions and obtain a precise picture of the critical behaviour .",
    "as before , to avoid excessive complexity , we have concentrated on the action ( [ eq:2cmodel ] ) with two couplings @xmath115 and @xmath116 .    at the beginning of section  [ sec : mf ] we have already noted that both the action and the reduced haar measure depend only on the conjugacy class of the ( untraced ) polyakov loop .",

    "the updating algorithm for the polyakov loop models has to be fast and versatile .",
    "it turns out that the standard metropolis algorithm favourably matches both requirements if we aim at an accuracy of about @xmath229 . on the other hand , because of the highly nontrivial probability measure involved , a heat bath algorithm does not seem applicable or , in any case , would be too time consuming .",
    "in addition , its local nature should not yield any enhancement of statistics near a first order phase transition .",
    "we have thus refrained from implementing a heat bath update scheme but rather decided to optimise the metropolis algorithm as described in the following two paragraphs .",
    "when a system undergoes a first order phase transition , the histogram associated with the order parameter will generically display a multi - peak structure .",
    "depending on the total volume of the system the peaks can be very pronounced .",
    "in other words , the configuration space is decomposed into distinct sectors between which local algorithms can hardly mediate .",
    "one way to overcome the resultant failure in sampling the total configuration space is to make use of the multicanonical algorithm , see e.g.@xcite .",
    "the crucial improvement step consists in the replacement of the measure used in ( [ eq : haarphi ] ) according to @xmath230 the new improved measure on the right - hand side has a weight @xmath231 which depends on the ( modulus of the ) order parameter .",

    "a slight problem with this approach , however , still has to be overcome .",
    "one actually needs right at the beginning what one set out to compute originally , namely the distribution @xmath240 .",

    "the coupling is very close to critical . ]    in summary , the multicanonical algorithm yields substantial improvements compared to the standard metropolis algorithm and allows for very accurate simulations .",
    "lattices with volumes up to @xmath252 could thus be studied near the first order phase transition . however , as the implementation is very involved we applied it only to the minimal model ( @xmath253 ) . in principle , the generalisation to incorporating further couplings is straightforward , being merely a matter of having sufficient computing time available .",
    "the multicanonical algorithm is best suited for studying first order transitions .",
    "this is no longer true for second order transitions where it is outperformed by cluster algorithms  at least if there is one available . for our purposes",
    ", none of the algorithms on the market could be immediately put to use .",
    "we therefore decided to modify the well - known wolff algorithm @xcite , an extension of the swendsen - wang @xcite algorithm originally proposed for discrete spin systems .    before actually describing our modifications",
    "let us briefly recall the main idea of @xcite .",
    "suppose the action ( and the measure ) are invariant under a certain global symmetry which acts on the fields according to @xmath254 typically , the symmetry operator @xmath255 will depend on some parameters which we collectively denote by @xmath256 ( continuous or discrete ) so that @xmath257 .",
    "it is important to note that the operator @xmath255 has to be idempotent , @xmath258 , in order to ensure detailed balance .",
    "the algorithm then works according to the following list .    1 .",
    "fix some parameter @xmath259 and hence some transformation @xmath260 . randomly choose a lattice point @xmath261 and apply the symmetry transformation @xmath262 which may be viewed as flipping the field variable @xmath263 .",
    "the point @xmath261 is checked and added to the cluster .",
    "[ it : flipnn ] repeat the following for all unchecked neighbours @xmath264 of @xmath261 : + let @xmath265 denote the contribution to the action from the link @xmath266 and compute @xmath267 which may be rewritten as @xmath268 since @xmath269 is already invariant under @xmath255 .",
    "the decision to add @xmath264 to the cluster is subject to an accept / reject step so that the probability to flip @xmath270 becomes @xmath271 if @xmath272 is flipped , check the point @xmath264 .",
    "3 .   go back to step  ( [ it : flipnn ] ) for all sites added to the cluster in the previous step .",
    "note that measures whether it is advantageous to flip @xmath270 once @xmath263 has been flipped . from the very construction of the algorithm",
    "it should be already clear that the clusters will increase with the correlation length of the system . in this way one suppresses the phenomenon of critical slowing down observed with local algorithms .",
    "this makes the cluster algorithm particularly suited for the study of second order phase transitions .",
    "the first step in adapting the cluster algorithm to our needs is to find suitable symmetries of the action .",
    "being a polyakov loop model the symmetry in question is the discrete @xmath0 symmetry , @xmath273 .",
    "in addition , the action has to be real which implies constraints on the way complex conjugation acts .",
    "from these symmetries one can construct three operators @xmath274 , @xmath275 , acting on the polyakov loop according to @xmath276 as required the @xmath274 square to unity .",
    "furthermore , it is easy to see that both the operators @xmath93 appearing in and the domain of the polyakov loop @xmath85 are left invariant by the action of @xmath274 .",
    "the latter is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : reflections ] for a particular value of @xmath85 .",
    "illustration of the @xmath0 reflections @xmath274 used in our modified cluster algorithm . ]    for the actual algorithm the transformations are not immediately applicable since the simulation is based on the angular variables @xmath277 introduced in ( [ eq : defangulardecomp ] ) .",
    "however , it is just a matter of a little algebra to show that the @xmath274 act on the angles @xmath277 via @xmath278 whereas in the original cluster algorithm flipping along randomly chosen lattice sites is sufficient to guarantee ergodicity this is no longer true in the present case .",
    "hence , we have to augment the update scheme by standard metropolis sweeps to make the algorithm ergodic . for",
    "one monte carlo step our cluster algorithm finally can be summarised as follows :    1 .   choose a random number @xmath279 between @xmath280 and @xmath250 .",
    "2 .   do @xmath279 standard metropolis sweeps at randomly drawn lattice points .",
    "3 .   for a suitable fixed number @xmath281 repeat the steps for building a cluster as described above .",
    "do @xmath282 additional metropolis sweeps , again at randomly chosen lattice sites .",
    "from several test runs we have found that the number @xmath281 should be chosen such that total number of flipped sites after performing step ( 3 ) is approximately half the number of all lattice sites .",
    "thus , if @xmath283 denotes the typical size of a cluster , the following equation should hold ( at least approximately ) , @xmath284 one of the most interesting questions of course is the gain in performance compared to e.g.  the standard metropolis algorithm .",
    "we have found that the autocorrelation time for the order parameter @xmath285 is independent of both the lattice extent ( at least in the range @xmath286 ) and the coupling constant ( if close to the second order phase transition ) implying a dynamical critical exponent of @xmath287 .",
    "moreover , for an optimal choice of @xmath281 the autocorrelation time is of order unity . as a result , our cluster algorithm outperforms the metropolis algorithm even for small lattices . on the largest lattices we have considered the cluster algorithm reduces autocorrelation times by two orders of magnitude as compared to metropolis updating",
    "this improvement comes at the cost of a slightly increased complexity , specifically a factor of 1.5 in computing time which clearly is negligible . on the other hand , in line with our expectations",
    ", no significant improvement has been found near the first order transition .",
    "we present the results of our monte carlo simulations in the same two steps as for the mf approximation .",
    "hence , we first report on the minimal model ( [ eq : sgp ] ) and switch on @xmath116 later on . with only @xmath115 different from zero",
    "it is reasonably cheap to perform highly accurate measurements so that a precise quantitative comparison with the 3-state potts model is possible .    for the model ( [ eq:2cmodel ] ) with two couplings",
    "we determine the phase diagram in the @xmath115@xmath116 plane and compare with our expectations as laid out in the previous two sections .",
    "we conclude with a careful study of the nature of the phase transitions , in particular their continuity properties .      to determine the ferromagnetic phase transition for @xmath288 we have used standard techniques which need no further explanation .",
    "it suffices to note that in order to study the first order ( s - f ) transition we performed @xmath289 sweeps on a @xmath290-lattice in the multicanonical ensemble for each value of the coupling constant .",
    "this led to highly accurate statistics until we approached the close vicinity of the critical coupling itself . in this regime",
    "our statistics is restricted to @xmath291 independent samples due to large correlation times of the order of @xmath292 sweeps . as fig .",

    "moreover , as soon as the maxima of the broken ( ordered ) phase emerge the maximum at the origin has dissolved .",
    "hence , there is no coexistence of different phases as in the previous case but rather a continuous appearance of new maxima , branching away from the origin towards the corners of the fundamental domain .",
    "these features characterise a second order phase transition .",
    "analogous behaviour can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : histothree ] with the maxima now moving in roughly the opposite directions indicating a transition to the ac phase . still different is the s - af transition of fig .",
    "[ fig : histoeight ] . by the same reasoning as given above this transition is of second order as well .",
    "however , the probability function emerging in the broken phase does not display the usual three - fold symmetry we have observed for the previous transitions . although the figures seemingly look rotationally invariant one actually finds a six - fold degeneracy rather than a continuous one . the symmetry enhancement by a factor of two has a simple explanation .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ fig : histoeight ] shows the probability distribution of the af order parameter @xmath214 which is defined in terms of even and odd sub - lattices . interchanging the latter accounts for the additional factor of two .",
    "let us conclude this section with a short remark concerning figs .",
    "[ fig : histotwo ] and [ fig : histothree ] .",
    "we have seen that our numerical data seem to indicate the possibility of second order transitions from the disordered phase s to f or ac ordering .",
    "this is at variance with the folklore claiming the absence of a @xmath0 universality class in @xmath8 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "it is not excluded that the observed second order characteristics near the tricritical point ( s - f - ac ) derive from artifacts due to our algorithms . at the moment , however , we can not make a definite statement about this issue .",
    "obviously , the puzzle deserves further investigation in the future .",
    "as outlined in the introduction the original motivation for polyakov loop models lies in their status as effective theories for finite - temperature gluodynamics .",
    "however , our investigation of the statistical mechanics involved should have made it clear that they are interesting in their own right . in support of this statement",
    "we mention the 3-fold @xmath0 symmetry shared with the 3-state potts model , the nontrivial complex target space and the enormously rich phase structure resulting thereof .",
    "as we have seen , the latter can be understood qualitatively by simple energy - entropy considerations which predict a symmetric phase s close to the origin in coupling space ` surrounded ' by broken phases .",
    "these can exhibit ferromagnetic ( f ) , anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) or anti - centre ( ac ) ordering .",
    "this picture has been confirmed quantitatively both within a mean - field ( mf ) approximation and by extensive monte carlo simulations .",
    "both methods find a first order transition for s - f and a second order one for s - af . in order to capture the details of the phase diagram a total number of 8000 simulations ( corresponding to roughly 3000 hours of cpu time )",
    "was required .",
    "naturally , this has added further refinements to our classical and mf analysis like precise values for critical couplings and exponents .",
    "the agreement between mf and monte carlo result is much better than naively expected for a statistical model in @xmath8 .",
    "the s - f critical couplings agree to within 1% , the discontinuity @xmath325 within 10% and the s - af critical coupling within 20% .",
    "the precise agreement for the s - f transition suggests that the point where the s - f and s - ac critical lines merge is actually a _",
    "tricritical _ point where two first order transitions merge into a second order one .",
    "it is known that the upper critical dimension for a tricritical point is three @xcite so that in @xmath8 the mf approximation actually is exact apart from logarithmic corrections @xcite .",
    "this observation is corroborated by the fact that the polyakov loop model with two couplings is somewhat similar to the spin - one blume - capel @xcite model which apart from an ising term has an addition @xmath326 , @xmath327 , with 3 spin states .",
    "the model is known to have a tricritical point and is closely related to the 3-state potts model @xcite .",
    "the second order phase transition line is characterised by 3@xmath5 ising critical exponents .",
    "obviously , one should test the analogous exponents for our ac - f transition at the very left of our phase diagrams .",
    "one may also address the spatial localisation of the phases .",
    "on the 3@xmath5 lattice the coexisting phases should be separated by interfaces the tension of which can be measured ( see e.g.@xcite and references therein ) .    in the end one",
    "is of course interested in matching the effective couplings to the underlying microscopic theory , i.e. finite - temperature yang - mills .",
    "the resulting curve @xmath328 in the space of effective couplings should stay in the symmetric and ferromagentic phases .",
    "we have already solved the matching - problem for the ( simpler ) case of @xmath7 using inverse monte carlo methods based on schwinger - dyson equations . for @xmath9",
    "this is considerably more difficult ( at least technically ) due to the increased complexity of the haar measure .",
    "the problem is actually similar to one encountered in strong - coupling expansions where @xmath7 group integrals can be performed analytically which is no longer true for @xmath9 .",
    "nevertheless , we have been able to derive the relevant schwinger - dyson equations and hope to report on their applications in the near future .",
    "we thank guy buss for his contributions to the strong coupling expansion and georg bergner , wolfhard janke and erhard seiler for valuable hints .",
