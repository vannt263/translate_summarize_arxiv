    "minimal hypersurfaces on spheres with exactly two principal curvatures everywhere were studied by otsuki in ( @xcite ) , he reduced the problem of classifying them all , to the problem of solving an ode , and the problem of deciding about their compactness , to the problem of studying a real function given in term of an integral that related two periods of two functions involved in the immersions that he found . in this paper",
    "we changed the minimality condition for the constant mean curvature condition and using a slightly different point of view , we got similar results . as pointed out by do carmo and dajczer in ( @xcite ) , these hypersurfaces are rotations of a plane profile curve .",
    "the existence of these hypersurfaces as immersions have been established in ( @xcite ) and in ( @xcite ) .",
    "partial result about the condition for small values of @xmath2 that guarantee embedding were found in ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main work in this paper consists in studying these profile curves and in deciding when they are embedded .",
    "lemma ( [ the lemma ] ) and its corollary ( [ cor of the lemma ] ) played an important role in the understanding of the period of these profile curves for they were responsible of getting explicit formulas for these two numbers    @xmath27    with the property that every @xmath2 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be realized as the mean curvature of a non isoparametric embedded cmc hypersurface in @xmath5 , such that its profile curve is invariant under the group of rotation by an angle @xmath30 , and therefore the hypersurface admits the group @xmath6 in its group of isometries .",
    "one of the differences between the analysis of the profile curve in this work and otsuki s , is that otsuki used the supporting function of this profile curve .",
    "we , instead , studied the radius and the angle separately , and we proved that the angle function is increasing , which helps us to decide when this curve is injective and consequently , when the immersion is an embedding . in order to understand this angle function we got some help from the understanding of three vector fields defined in section ( [ section vector fields that lie on a planes ] ) .",
    "since we can obtain a similar formula for the angle of the profile curve for cmc hypersurfaces in the hyperbolic space , we also extend the result in this case in order to explicitly exhibit embedded examples the hyperbolic space .",
    "also , similar results are obtained in euclidean spaces .",
    "these results on embedded hypersurfaces on hyperbolic spaces and euclidean spaces where proven in ( @xcite ) with different techniques .    as a consequence of the symmetries proven for all compact constant mean curvatures in @xmath5 with two principal curvatures everywhere",
    ", we proved that all these examples with @xmath31 , have stability index greater than @xmath26 . in this direction",
    "there is a conjecture that states that the only minimal hypersurfaces in @xmath5 with stability index @xmath26 are the isoparametric with two principal curvatures .",
    "some partial results for this conjecture were proven in ( @xcite ) .",
    "also , since it is not difficult to prove that these examples can be chosen to be as close as we want from the isoparametric examples , we proved that some of otsuki s minimal hypersurfaces are examples of non isoparametric compact stable minimal truncated cones in @xmath25 for @xmath32 .",
