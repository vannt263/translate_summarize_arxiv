    "strontium titanate ( srtio@xmath0 ; sto ) is a complex oxide perovskite of great technological interest for its superconductivity,@xcite blue - light emission,@xcite photovoltaic effect,@xcite and so on . under normal conditions ,",
    "bulk srtio@xmath0  crystallizes in a cubic perovskite structure ; it subsequently undergoes a second order phase transition at @xmath1=105 k to a tetragonal structure with slightly rotated oxygens around the z - axis , known as the antiferrodistortive  ( afd ) phase ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stocell ] ) .",
    "many of the interesting properties of sto , either in bulk or in superlattices formed with other metal oxides , are believed to be caused by the cubic to afd phase transition .",
    "examples of this attribution are sto s superlattice s high t@xmath2 superconductivity  @xcite and its colossal magnetoresistivity .  @xcite first - principles calculations ( see ref .   and",
    "references therein ) have indicated that the strain - induced competition between octahedral rotation modes and the lattice distortion in metal oxide superlattices are behind these interesting properties .",
    "thus , there is a considerable need  @xcite for precise theoretical calculations of the structural and electronic properties of complex oxides , as well as accurate estimation of the phase transition order parameters , to understand and eventually exploit these phenomena .",
    "unit cells for the a ) cubic phase and b ) antiferrodistortive phase ; b ) shows the tio@xmath3 octahedra s rotation around the [ 001 ] axis .",
    "sr atom are in green , ti are in blue and o are in red . the o@xmath4 ( equatorial ) and o@xmath5 ( axial ) labels denote the non - rotating and rotating oxygens , respectively . , width=297 ]    the phase transition of sto is governed by two order parameters .",
    "the primary order parameter is the rotation angle of the tio@xmath3 octahedra ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the experimentally measured  @xcite octahedral rotation of afd sto is 1.4  at 77 k and increases as the temperature drops toward the maximum measured value of 2.1  at 4.2  k. the octahedron s rotation is believed to be almost complete  @xcite at around 50  k , where @xmath6=2.01@xmath70.07  was reported .",
    "the secondary order parameter is the tetragonality of the unit cell ( @xmath8 ) , which increases from 1.00056  @xcite to 1.0009  @xcite as the temperature decreases from 65  k to 10  k. the afd phase can also appear in thin films of sto  @xcite at much higher t@xmath2 than the bulk , depending on the substrate used , the thickness of deposited sto film , the strain and the lattice mismatch .",
    "for example , 10 nm of sto deposited on laalo@xmath9 ( lao ) undergoes a transition to the afd phase at  332  k.    as the simplest metal oxide perovskite , sto has been extensively studied in the last decades with different _ ab initio _",
    "schemes.@xcite however , it is still a challenging material for theory ; only a few of the previously published works have been able to accurately describe the structural and electronic properties of the both phases of sto .",
    "the balance of this section will consist of a brief review of the theoretical work performed to date .",
    "sai and vanderbilt  @xcite carried out one of the first lda calculations on sto using a plane - wave basis and ultra - soft pseudopotentials .",
    "lda predicted an exaggerated tetragonal afd phase of sto , with octahedral rotation angles of 6 ,  significantly overestimating the 2.1  rotation measured experimentally .",
    "@xcite using lda with other basis sets  @xcite shows similar issues , predicting rotations up 8.4 .",
    "wahl et al .",
    "@xcite used a plane - wave basis while simulating sto with lda@xcite , pbe  @xcite and pbesol.@xcite ( see section [ sec : comp ] for further descriptions of these density functionals ) .",
    "lda underestimated experimental lattice constants , while pbe overestimated them ; both methods had band - gaps that were seriously underestimated compared to experiment .",
    "this underestimation is well known for these functionals ; see _ e.g. _ ref .   and references therein .",
    "pbesol was found to reproduce accurately the experimental structure , but considerably underestimated the band gaps .",
    "for the afd phase , the octahedral angle @xmath6 was found to be very sensitive to the functional used ; all three overestimate the afd deformation , with lda worse than pbe and pbesol splitting the difference .",
    "rondinelli et al .",
    "@xcite applied the lsda+@xmath10 correction to cubic sto and found that while it corrects the band gap , the calculated octahedral rotation angle remains overestimated at 5.7 .",
    "to date , none of the post - dft corrections which benefit band - gaps have successfully corrected the octahedral rotation overestimation , and many authors attribute this to the argument proposed by sai and vanderbilt  @xcite stating that this can be caused by the exchange and correlation terms in dft not capturing quantum point fluctuations .",
    "piskunov et al .",
    "@xcite conducted one of the most complete and comprehensive _ ab initio _ studies of sto , using gaussian basis sets specifically optimized for modeling sto crystals .",
    "this study of sto showed problems when modeling with pure dft or pure hf , namely underestimated and overestimated band gaps , respectively ; this is a well known problem.@xcite hybrid functionals , specifically b3pw@xcite and b3lyp,@xcite gave more reasonable results , with direct band gaps overestimated by 5% for b3pw and 3.5% for b3lyp compared to experiment and indirect band gaps overestimated by 12% for b3pw and 10% for b3lyp .",
    "( we will demonstrate that an important part of this overestimation can be attributed to the basis set employed ; see section  [ sec : basis ] . )",
    "the hybrid functionals also gave the best agreement with experiment for the lattice constant and the bulk modulus , and generally did better than semilocal functionals in all categories .",
    "this success of hybrid functionals motivated more detailed calculations  @xcite of the properties of the cubic and afd phases of sto , again using the optimized basis set of piskunov et al .",
    "@xcite and the b3pw functional .",
    "next , wahl et al .",
    "@xcite applied the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof  @xcite screened coulomb hybrid density functional ( hse ) in a plane - wave basis set .",
    "hse performed exceptionally well , doing much better than any of semilocal functionals , as it gave a very accurate estimate of both the structural and electronic properties of the cubic phase .",
    "hse also showed excellent agreement with the experimental octahedral angle and tetragonality of the unit cell which constitute , to our knowledge , the most accurately computed sto properties available in the literature for both phases , prior to the current study .",
    "as noted above , hybrid functionals have proved their effectiveness in studying metal oxides , but they are computationally much more demanding than semilocal functionals . while it would be ideal to do high accuracy _ ab initio _ on metal oxide superlattices using complete basis sets and large supercells ,",
    "this is prohibitively expensive at the current level of computer power . screened hybrid functionals with only short range exact exchange are computationally less demanding ; they allow the use of large supercells , especially when used with localized basis sets such as gaussian functions .",
    "we hope to use the most effective methods / basis sets from this study on more complicated metal oxide systems , and thus we have concentrated on methods and basis sets that would be practical for those systems as well as the systems currently under consideration .",
    "this paper focuses on two tightly linked problems .",
    "we are interested in the degree of completeness ( or size ) of the localized basis set necessary to correctly simulate both phases of sto , and in the efficacy of recently developed functionals ( including screened hybrids ) in predicting the properties of sto . to discuss these issues , the paper proceeds as follows : in section [ sec : comp ] , we briefly describe the technical details before turning in section [ sec : basis ] to the basis set optimization / modification technique we used to make standard basis sets pbc - compatible . in section  [ sec : results ] , we report the results of semilocal and range separated hybrid functionals applied to the cubic and the afd phases of sto .",
    "we show also how the quality of basis set affected the accurate prediction of the octahedral rotation angle in the afd phase of sto .",
    "finally , we discuss the results of our best functional / basis set combination for sto , comparing them with previously published theoretical and experimental data , with special emphasis on the effect of varying the range separation parameter in the screened functionals .",
    "all calculations were performed using a development version of the gaussian suite of programs,@xcite with the periodic boundary condition ( pbc)@xcite code used throughout .",
    "a wide array of functionals were applied , including : the local spin density approximation  @xcite ( lsda ) , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) corrected functional of perdew , burke and ernzerhof  @xcite ( pbe ) , the reparametrization of pbe for solids , pbesol ,  @xcite the revised meta - gga of tao , perdew , staroverov and scuseria@xcite ( revtpss ) , and finally a modern and highly parametrized meta - gga functional , m06l .",
    "@xcite two screened hybrid functionals were also tested , namely the short - range exact exchange functional of heyd , scuseria , and ernzerhof  @xcite ( hse , with the 2006 errata , also referred to as hse06 ) and the exact exchange in middle - range functional of henderson , izmaylov , scuseria , and savin ( hiss).@xcite because regular hybrids with unscreened exact exchange like b3lyp and b3pw have higher computational cost compared to screened hybrids we decided to exclude them from this test .",
    "gaussian basis sets of different quality have been tested for their ability to simulate the properties of sto ; the details of these tests and the modification of the basis set was detailed enough to merit its own section , section  [ sec : basis ] .",
    "a few numerical considerations should be mentioned here . during the initial ( or exploratory ) calculations for the afd phase",
    ", we found some dependence of octahedral rotation angle ( @xmath6 ) on initial atomic positions .",
    "after further investigation , this can be attributed to the geometric optimization convergence criteria .",
    "since @xmath6 is so small , very stringent convergence criteria is required .",
    "hartrees / bohr . using `` verytight '' convergence ,",
    "this becomes 1@xmath11 .",
    "] another modified ( versus the default ) setting was that a pruned integration grid for dft of ( 99 , 590 ) was employed , which corresponds to the gaussian option `` ultrafine '' .",
    "note that this grid is big enough for this system to avoid any of the instabilities with m06l reported in the literature with small grids.@xcite to ensure this , we tested m06l with a larger grid , without noticing any modification in the calculated properties .",
    "thus while `` ultrafine '' is sometimes insufficient for m06l , it is not for this system .",
    "other numerical settings in gaussian were left at the default values , _",
    "e.g. _ integral cut - offs , k - point meshes12@xmath1212 _ k _ -point mesh for the cubic unit cell , while for the larger afd supercell , the default _ k _ -point mesh of 8@xmath128@xmath126 was found to be sufficient . ] , scf convergence criterion , . ] and the like .",
    "finally , the geometry of each phase is worth discussing briefly .",
    "the starting configuration for the cubic phase ( see figure  [ fig : stocell](a ) ) consisted of the perovskite primitive cell containing 5 atoms at the experimental lattice constant  @xcite ( @xmath13= 3.890  ) .",
    "for the afd phase , we could nt simply use the 5 atom tetragonal unit cell with rotated oxygens and the lattice parameters set to @xmath14 .",
    "a 20 atoms supercell / simulation cell was necessary , as the phase transition requires a rotation of every pair of neighboring tio@xmath3 octahedra in opposite directions ( figure  [ fig : stocell](b ) ) .",
    "thus , the volume of the afd supercell is about four times the volume of the cubic phase with tetragonal lattice constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 being the lattice parameters of the 5 atoms tetragonal unit cell in the afd phase .",
    "the starting afd structure of sto was taken from the experimental structure of jauch et al .",
    "@xcite obtained at 50  k and downloaded as cif file from the icsd,@xcite with @xmath19    and @xmath20   .",
    "the starting rotation angle for tio@xmath3 octahedra was 2.1  while the @xmath21 .",
    "please note the geometries were only starting points ; as mentioned above all geometries were optimized with the method / basis set under consideration . in order to avoid introducing any errors coming from size effects or k - space integration , the calculated properties of the afd supercell",
    "are always compared with a 20 atoms supercell constructed from four cubic primitive cells ( without octahedral rotation or tetragonality ) fully relaxed using the same _ k _ -point mesh .",
    "it should be noted that the supercell in the cubic phase is a local minimum and is higher in energy than the supercell in the afd phase for all reported calculations .",
    "the final ( reported ) @xmath6 values were determined from ti - o@xmath5-ti angle measurements , and any octahedral tilts can be estimated by measuring the ti - o@xmath4-ti angles ( o@xmath22 s subscript was defined in figure  [ fig : stocell ] ) .",
    "finally , all geometric visualization was done using gaussview .",
    "the challenge in selecting a basis set is always balancing accuracy with computational cost . in molecular calculations , the computational cost of a gaussian basis set is determined by the number of functions used , while in pbc calculations the spatial extent or diffuseness of the basis set also plays a major role .",
    "the more diffuse a basis set is , the larger the chunk of matter that must be included in the calculations to avoid numerical issues .    coupled with the argument that the long density tail is more necessary for molecular work than work in extended systems , it becomes obvious that basis sets developed for non - periodic calculations can require modification for pbc use .",
    "this section describes the basis set optimization / modification procedure we employed to find the appropriate gaussian basis sets to simulate periodic sto while keeping within reasonable computational expense .",
    "we based our evaluations of a basis set s accuracy on cubic sto results using the heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof  @xcite screened coulomb hybrid density functional ( hse06 ) .",
    "@xcite    the obvious starting point was the basis sets used in previous calculations / studies of bulk sto , including :    * gaussian - type basis sets published by piskunov et al .",

    "both * p1 *  and * p2 *  reproduce the experimental equilibrium lattice constants  @xcite ( see table  [ tab : basis ] ) almost perfectly .",
    "cubic sto modeled with * p1 *   has a slightly higher bulk modulus compared to * p2 * , although the difference between the two basis sets in fairly minimal for structural properties .",
    "a more important effect is observed for the electronic properties : * p1 *  and * p2 *  overestimate the direct band gap of sto by 0.12 and 0.05 ev respectively , and seriously overestimate the indirect band gap by 0.28 and 0.21 ev .",
    "it is easy to see that the * p2 *  basis set employed with hse06 lead to results that are closer to experiment than * p1 * , a fact noted by piskunov@xcite for a number of functionals .",
    "the more important point is that increasing the size / quality of the basis set made a noticeable change in the results ; the immediate question is whether another increase in basis set size would bring about similar improvement . in other words , using polarization _",
    "d_-orbitals for o and diffuse functions for ti improved the hse06 results , and imply that further improvement could potentially be achieved if more basis set improvements are implements , _",
    "e.g. _ including titanium core electrons and/or adding more diffuse functions for oxygen .",
    "we decided to optimize some of the * def2- *  @xcite series of gaussian basis sets for use in bulk sto calculations .",
    "the original * def2- * basis sets for the atoms of interest in this project included small - exponent diffuse functions ( @xmath26 less than 0.10 ) that are spatially quite extended ; as stated above , this long tail is necessary to improve the dft results for molecules but not necessary for crystals .",
    "@xcite basis sets with large spatial ranges dramatically slow down the calculation of coulomb contributions to the total energy of crystals .",
    "thus , to be useful in pbc calculations , * def2- * basis sets must be modified by removing some of the most diffuse functions .    the series of * def2- * basis sets are available up to quadruple zeta valence quality for a large set of elements.@xcite in the original optimizations , the oxygen , strontium and titanium basis sets were optimized ( using hf and dft ) versus the properties of sro , tio and tio@xmath5 molecules",
    "strontium has the inner shell electrons replaced with small core pseudopotentials ,  @xcite while the other two atoms utilize all electron basis sets ; this differs from * p1 *  and * p2 *  which uses pseudopotentials on titanium as well . in general , * def2- * basis sets are larger and more expensive than * p1 *  and * p2 *  basis sets , but are expected to give a better representation of both phases of sto due to greater `` completeness . ''    to make a * def2- * basis set applicable to pbc , the first step is selecting a maximum allowable diffuseness , or equivalently the smallest acceptable gaussian orbital exponent , @xmath26",
    ". the larger the value of @xmath26 , the faster the calculations become , but if @xmath26 is set too high , significant degradation of physical property prediction results .",
    "after the threshold is defined , one pass is made through the basis set to reset all @xmath27 to @xmath26 , and then a second pass is made through the basis set to remove any redundancies .",
    "note that after modifying or deleting an element of a contracted basis set , we rely on the code s internal renormalization code , _",
    "i.e. _ no attempt is made to reoptimize contraction coefficients .",
    "we first began with the largest * def2- * basis sets , def2-qzvp and def2-qzvpp , but these were found to be computationally intractable for bulk sto even for @xmath26 as big as 0.2 , and previous experience have shown that @xmath26 larger than 0.2 causes physically unacceptable results .",
    "we then moved to the smaller basis sets , def2-tzvp and def2-szvp .",
    "we first set @xmath26=  0.12 , but found this made the calculations very slow .",
    "our tests showed that @xmath26=  0.15 constitutes a more computationally efficient choice without important loss in accuracy .",
    "henceforth , the def2-tzvp and def2-szvp , with @xmath26 modified and redundant _ s _ functions removed , will be denoted * tzvp * and * szvp * , respectively .    table  [ tab : basis ] summarizes the calculated electronic and structural properties of cubic sto using our basis set modifications as well as the aforementioned * p1 *  and * p2*. the optimized basis sets * szvp * and * tzvp * give an overall excellent agreement with experiment :  @xcite direct band gaps are now underestimated by 0.16 ev while indirect band gaps are now underestimated by @xmath280.05 ev .",
    "these two new basis sets are larger than the previously utilized * p1 *  and * p2 * , are more accurate for indirect gaps , as well for other measured properties , and due to their greater size are expected to be closer to the upper limit of hse06 accuracy for this system .",
    "note also that the electronic properties of sto remain almost unchanged by moving from a * szvp * to * tzvp * basis set .",
    "the deviation from the experimental lattice constant do not exceed 0.07 and 0.3% for * szvp * and * tzvp * respectively but is more substantial for the bulk modulus reaching 14% for * szvp * and 8% for * tzvp*. finally , the same series of basis set optimizations were also performed using hiss and m06l functionals , which lead to the same conclusions regarding the basis set efficiency ; these are not presented here for space reasons .    before moving on to the results section",
    ", a brief mention of the expense of the various basis sets should be included . in term of relative cpu time",

    "focusing first on the * tzvp * results , we observe that the screened hybrids hse06 and hiss give lattice parameters in excellent agreement with experiment .",
    "the calculated bulk modulus using hse06 is fairly close to the experimentally reported values , although overestimated by 8% .",
    "( the same magnitude of overestimation have been also reported in the hse planewave calculations of wahl et al .",

    "this is an example of pbesol meeting its purpose , as it improves the pbe lattice constant and bulk modulus for the cubic phase , approaching very closely the experimental data .",
