    "for the insulated unit sphere @xmath4 in @xmath5 of total charge + 1 on which particles interact according to the riesz-@xmath1 potential @xmath6 , @xmath7 , where @xmath3 is the euclidean distance between two particles , the equilibrium distribution of charge is uniform ; that is , given by normalized surface area measure @xmath8 on @xmath4 .",
    "however , in the presence of an `` external field '' due to a nearby point charge the equilibrium distribution changes .",
    "a positive external field repels charge away from the portion of the sphere near the source and may even clear a spherical cap of charge , whereas a negative external field attracts charge nearer to the source , thus ` thinning out ' a region on @xmath4 opposite to the direction of the source . in the coulomb case @xmath9 and @xmath10",
    "this is a well - studied problem in electrostatics ( cf .",

    "[ sec : gonchar.s.question ] we introduce and discuss a problem ( _ gonchar s problem _ ) concerning the critical distance from a unit point charge to @xmath4 such that the support of the @xmath1-equilibrium measure on the sphere ( for riesz @xmath1-potential @xmath6 , @xmath11 ) is no longer all of the sphere when the point charge is at any closer distance .",
    "we shall make this more precise below .",
    "our starting point is the solution to the `` signed equilibrium problem '' for a positive charge outside the sphere , which is intimately connected with the solution of this external field energy problem . using similar methods , we are able to extend the results in @xcite to external fields due to a positive / negative point charge inside / outside the sphere",
    ". we shall analyze gonchar s problem for different magnitudes and for both positive and negative charges which , in turn , will provide a more comprehensive picture than presented in @xcite and @xcite , and will reveal some interesting new phenomena . for example , in the case when @xmath12 is an even positive integer , a logarithmic term appears in the formula for the critical distance ; and for a negative external field due to a source inside the sphere , a crucial issue is whether the riesz kernel is strictly subharmonic ( @xmath13 ) or strictly superharmonic ( @xmath14 ) .    for the logarithmic potential , we are able to provide a complete answer for gonchar s problem . in the classical ( harmonic ) case @xmath15 ( and",
    "more generally , when @xmath16 is an odd positive integer ) the critical distance appears as a zero of a certain family of polynomials indexed by the dimension @xmath0 .",
    "the classical case and the associated polynomials are discussed in some detail in @xcite . by allowing a negative as well as positive charge @xmath17 and allowing this charge to be inside or outside the sphere , we derive a family of polynomials for each of the four combinations : ( i ) @xmath18 and @xmath19 , ( ii ) @xmath20 and @xmath19 , ( iii ) @xmath18 and @xmath21 , and ( iv ) @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in section  [ sec : polynomial.families ] , we investigate these four families of polynomials arising from gonchar s problem .",
