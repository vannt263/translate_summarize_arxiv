    "the @xmath3 decay mode of most candidate nuclei has been observed and its half - life determined .",
    "thus , the corresponding nuclear matrix elements @xmath5 are known .",
    "these matrix elements , of dimension energy@xmath6 , vary abruptly between nuclei with different @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; they exhibit pronounced shell effects .",
    "in contrast , the fundamentally more important @xmath1 decay mode have not been reliably observed so far .",
    "therefore , the corresponding dimensionless nuclear matrix elements @xmath9 must be evaluated theoretically .",
    "these calculated quantities , whether based on the qrpa @xcite , nuclear shell model @xcite , or the interacting boson model @xcite , do not show such a variability ; instead they vary relatively smoothly between nuclei with different @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "evaluation of the @xmath9 using the generator coordinate method @xcite or the projected hartree - fock - bogolyubov method @xcite vary smoothly with @xmath7 and @xmath8 as well .    however , the calculated values of the matrix elements @xmath9 using different approximations do not agree with each other perfectly , differences of a factor of about two exist .",
    "moreover , given the fundamental importance of these quantities for the planning and interpreting the @xmath1 decay experiments , it would be good to have independent observables that could be linked to their magnitude . in that context",
    "we wish to address in this work several questions :    * can one understand intuitively the different behavior of @xmath9 and @xmath5 when of @xmath7 and @xmath8 are varied ?",
    "* is there a formal relation between @xmath9 and @xmath5 ? * if such relation exists can it be used to test the calculated values of the @xmath1 matrix elements ?    in discussing these problems",
    "we basically follow the work published by us and our collaborators earlier in ref . @xcite .",
    "assuming that the @xmath1 decay is caused by exchange of the light majorana neutrinos , the nuclear matrix element consists of gamow - teller , fermi and tensor parts , @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are matrix element ratios that are smaller than unity and , presumably , less dependent on the details of the applied nuclear model .    in the following we concentrate on the gt part , @xmath13 ,",
    "which can be somewhat symbolically written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the neutrino potential and @xmath16 is the relative distance between the two neutrons that are transformed in the decay into the two protons .",
    "the dependence of @xmath9 on the distance @xmath16 is described by the function @xmath17 ( first introduced in @xcite see also @xcite ) @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the dirac delta function .    in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eq : c(r ) ] ) we can define for the case of the @xmath3 decay a new function @xmath20 this function , therefore , is related to the dimensionless _ closure _ matrix element for the @xmath3 decay , not the true , dimension energy@xmath6 matrix element @xmath5 that contains the corresponding energy denominators . while the matrix elements @xmath5 and @xmath2 get contributions only from the @xmath21 intermediate states , the function @xmath22 gets contributions from all intermediate multipoles .",
    "this is the consequence of the @xmath23 function in the definition of @xmath22 . naturally ,",
    "when integrated over @xmath4 only the contributions from the @xmath21 are nonvanishing .",
    "it is now clear that , by construction , @xmath24 which is valid for any shape of the neutrino potential @xmath25 .",
    "thus , if @xmath22 is known , @xmath26 and therefore also @xmath0 can be easily determined since the neutrino potential @xmath27 is known and only weakly dependent on the average excitation energy @xmath28 .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : basic ] ) represents the basic relation between the @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31-decay modes .     for different selected candidate nuclei . ]",
    "examples of the function @xmath22 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c(r ) ] . note that while the function @xmath22 has a substantial negative tail past @xmath32 fm , these distances contribute very little to @xmath26 and , therefore also to @xmath9 .",
    "this is a consequence of the shape of the neutrino potential @xmath27 that decreases fast with increasing values of the distance @xmath4 .",
    "remembering that in a nucleus the average distance between nucleons is @xmath331.2 fm we can somewhat schematically separate the range of the variable @xmath4 in the functions @xmath26 and @xmath22 into the region @xmath34 2 - 3 fm governed by the nucleon - nucleon correlations , while the region @xmath35 2 - 3 fm is governed by nuclear many - body physics . from the form of @xmath26",
    "it follows that the matrix elements @xmath0 are almost independent of the  nuclear \" region of @xmath4 and hence one does not expect rapid variations of their value when @xmath8 or @xmath7 of the nucleus is changed . on the other hand , the @xmath30 closure matrix elements @xmath2 depend sensitively on that region of @xmath4 since there is a substantial cancellation between the positive part at @xmath36 fm and the negative tail at @xmath37 fm .",
    "hence one expects sizable shell effects , i.e. a significant variation of @xmath5 and @xmath2 with @xmath8 and @xmath7 , in agreement with observations .",
    "we have thus answered the first two questions posed in the introduction .    but",
    "answering the third question is not so simple .",
    "while the nuclear matrix elements @xmath5 are simply related to the @xmath30 half - life @xmath38 , and are thus known for the nuclei in which @xmath38 has been measured , the closure matrix elements @xmath2 need be determined separately .",
    "one can rely on a nuclear model ( e.g. qrpa or nuclear shell model ) , adjust parameters in such a way that the experimental value of @xmath5 is correctly reproduced , and use the model to evaluate @xmath2 .",
    "alternatively , one could use the measured @xmath39 and @xmath40 strength functions and assume coherence ( i.e. same signs ) among states with noticeable strengths in both channels . in this way an upper limit of @xmath2 can be obtained . obviously , neither of these procedures is exact . in the following",
    "we leave temporarily aside the important question to which extent the function @xmath22 is strongly constrained by its integral value @xmath2 .",
    "we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , within qrpa , the quantities @xmath2 are negative in many cases , contrary to simple expectations ( because one obviously expects that the average excitation energy is positive ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the second method , mentioned above , leads to the positive @xmath2 by definition .",
    "thus , the two methods disagree with each other .     for different selected nuclei as a function of the excitation energy of the @xmath21 states in the intermediate odd - odd nucleus .",
    "]    since there is a substantial experimental activity devoted to the determination of the @xmath41 strengths @xcite , it is worthwhile to examine in more detail the somewhat unexpected finding that in many cases @xmath5 and @xmath2 have opposite signs .",
    "obviously , this has to do with the different weights of the individual @xmath21 intermediate states in @xmath5 and @xmath2 . because of this the higher energy excited @xmath21 states contribute substantially more to @xmath2 than to @xmath5 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stairs ] we plot the running sums of @xmath2 as the function of excitation energy in the intermediate nucleus .",
    "one can see that there are negative contributions to the @xmath2 values that arise from excitation energies @xmath42 mev where it is difficult to explore experimentally the corresponding @xmath40 strength .",
    "note , moreover , that this is the region of the giant gt resonance , with substantial @xmath39 strength .",
    "hence even a relatively small @xmath40 strength can have a sizable effect .",
    "the negative contribution to @xmath5 and @xmath2 from relatively high lying @xmath21 states seems to be a generic effect present in essentially all nuclei .",
    "( note that analogous effect is present in the shell model evaluation of @xmath5 for @xmath43ca , see ref .",
    "@xcite , fig . 1 . ) .",
    "thus , it appears that in many cases when the matrix elements @xmath5 ( with energy denominators , see @xcite ) are evaluated as a function of the intermediate state excitation energy , the final correct value is reached twice ; once at relatively low excitation energy and the second time asymptotically .",
    "these negative contributions to @xmath5 and @xmath2 , coming from the vicinity of the giant gt state , clearly exist only in calculations that are able to describe the giant gt resonance . in the restricted shell model calculations ( without the full set of the spin - orbit partners ) such high lying @xmath21",
    "will be absent .",
    "thus , we need to make sure that a noticeable @xmath40 strength connecting the final nucleus with the @xmath21 states in the vicinity of the gt resonance really exists and is not an artifact of our qrpa evaluation .",
    "unless and until this dilemma is resolved it is premature to proceed further in our original program of finding connection between the nuclear matrix elements of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 @xmath31-decay modes .    nevertheless , we have established a formal relation between the nuclear matrix elements @xmath0 of the neutrinoless @xmath31 decay and the @xmath2 , the closure matrix element for the @xmath3 decay .",
    "we also pose a challenge to both experimentalists studying the charge exchange reactions of the @xmath44 type , and to theorists using methods alternative to qrpa to establish whether a noticeable @xmath40 strength at energies near the giant gt resonance exists or not .",
