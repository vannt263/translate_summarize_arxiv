    "the @xmath25 penguin loop process plays an important role in rare @xmath26 meson decays  @xcite",
    ". it could be sensitive to new physics beyond the standard model due to additional contributions from as yet - unknown heavy virtual particles in the loop .",
    "recently the study of the penguin dominated baryonic @xmath26 decays @xmath27  @xcite and @xmath28  @xcite gave intriguing results .",
    "the proton polar angular distributions in the baryon - antibaryon helicity frame disagree with the expectations for short distance @xmath25 weak decays  @xcite .",
    "however , in @xmath29 decays  @xcite , the @xmath30 seems to be fully polarized in the helicity zero state in agreement with the @xmath25 weak decay hypothesis .",
    "the theoretical hierarchies , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , from the pole model  @xcite are experimentally established although the predicted branching fraction @xmath33 is about a factor of 20 smaller than the experimental measurement .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study the corresponding branching fractions for @xmath34 decays , the counterparts with protons replaced by @xmath35 s .    in this paper",
    ", we study the charmless three - body decays @xmath0 , where @xmath1 stands for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , or @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the mode @xmath36 has been previously observed  @xcite and presumably proceeds through a @xmath37 process .",
    "this decay process can be related to @xmath27 as shown in fig .",

    "[ fg : feyn](b ) .",
    "one can simply replace the @xmath38 diquark pair with an @xmath39 pair to establish a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath40 and @xmath41 decays .",
    "a common feature of these decays is that the baryon - antibaryon mass spectra peak near threshold as conjectured in refs .",
    "the @xmath3 meson carries the energetic @xmath42 quark from the @xmath43 transition so that a threshold enhancement of the baryon and antibaryon system is naturally formed .",
    "however , there is another possibility shown in fig .",

    "since the branching fractions of @xmath45 and @xmath46 decays are theoretically expected at a level  @xcite that is detectable with our present data sample , we attempt to determine the branching fractions of the various @xmath0 decays and compare with the latest measurements for @xmath40 . we also examine the low mass @xmath24 enhancements near threshold and the related angular distributions in order to investigate the underlying dynamics .    -7.4",

    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter composed of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a super - conducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
