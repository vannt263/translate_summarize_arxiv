    "the gravitational microlensing surveys toward the galactic bulge ( gb ) have been shown to be useful for exoplanet searches , the study of the structure , kinematics and dynamics of the galaxy , and measurement the stellar and sub - stellar mass functions , as the event rate and timescale distributions are related to the masses and velocities of lens objects ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . to date , several thousands of microlensing events have been detected in the gb by the microlensing survey groups : ogle ( @xcite ) , moa ( @xcite ) , macho ( @xcite ) and eros ( @xcite ) .",
    "thousands of detections are expected in the upcoming years from the moa - ii , ogle - iv , and wise @xcite surveys , which are currently in operation .",
    "these surveys will soon be joined by the kmtnet survey @xcite .",
    "the magnification of a microlensing event is described by ( @xcite )    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the projected separation of the source and lens in units of the einstein radius @xmath24 which is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the lens mass , @xmath27 is the normalized lens distance and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the observer - lens and the observer - source distances .",
    "the time variation of @xmath30 is    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are , respectively , the minimum impact parameter in units of @xmath24 , the time of maximum magnification , the einstein radius crossing time ( or timescale ) , and the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the line of sight toward the source star . from light curve alone",
    ", one can determine the values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath36 , but not the values of @xmath26 , @xmath37 or @xmath35 .",
    "the microlensing optical depth , @xmath38 is the fraction of the sky covered by the einstein ring disks of the lenses for a given source population , and it is directly related to the mass density of compact objects along the line of sight ( @xcite ) .",
    "theoretically , it is simpler than the microlensing event rate , @xmath39 , because it does nt depend on the lens and source velocity distribution . practically , it is difficult to measure , however , because long duration events give a large contribution to @xmath38 , and it is difficult to ensure that there is not a significant contribution from events with a duration longer than the maximum @xmath36 for a given analysis .",
    "because of this , we present observed values of the optical depth with a subscript , which indicates the maximum @xmath36 value allowed by the analysis of each observational sample .    despite this ambiguity due to long duration events , previous galactic bulge microlensing optical depth results have been somewhat controversial . @xcite and @xcite first predicted the optical depth of @xmath40 , assuming that all events were associated with known disk stars .",
    "after the first several bulge events were reported by ogle ( @xcite ) and macho @xcite , the high event rate prompted @xcite to evaluate the contribution of bulge stars in addition to the disk stars .",
    "they estimated @xmath41 and concluded that the value could be about twice as large , if the bulge were elongated along the line of sight .",
    "nevertheless , the first measurements of the optical depth , @xmath42 by ogle ( @xcite ) and @xmath43 by macho ( @xcite ) , were well above the predictions .",
    "the later studies based on difference image analysis ( dia ) , which is less sensitive to the systematics of blending in crowded fields , also found relatively large optical depths : @xmath44 centered at @xmath45 from 99 events by macho ( @xcite ) and @xmath46 centered at @xmath47 from 28 events by moa ( @xcite ) ( where the dubious adjustment factor to  correct \" for foreground disk stars has not been uesed . )",
    "this macho dia analysis had one known @xmath48-day event that was removed by the @xmath49day cut , and the inclusion of this single event would have raised the measured @xmath38 value by @xmath50% .    to explain high optical depths",
    "a number of authors have suggested the presence of a bar oriented along our line of sight to the gb ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and have adopted various values of the bar orientation and mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting values are in the range @xmath51 .",
    "@xcite have shown that high optical depth measurements available at the time could not be easily reconciled with our general understanding of the galactic dynamics , and that the standard models of the galaxy would need to be revised .",
    "@xcite raised the possibility of a systematic bias in the optical depth measurement due to the difficulties of measuring @xmath36 associated with blended unresolved sources .",
    "when the actual source base - line flux is unknown , @xmath36 and @xmath32 are degenerate in relatively low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) events ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite postulated that optical depth may be estimated without a bias due to blending by using only events with bright source stars , such as red clump giants , in which they thought that the blending might be negligible , rather than using all stars including the faint sources as in previous studies .",
    "although the first measurements by @xcite gave a high value @xmath52 , the later measurements based on events with bright sources have returned lower optical depths : @xmath53 at @xmath54 from 16 events by eros ( @xcite ) , @xmath55 at @xmath56 from 42 events by macho ( @xcite ) , and @xmath57   \\times 10^{-6}$ ] , with @xmath58 based on 120 eros events @xcite .",
    "all the bright star analyses discussed above have one drawback compared to the dia analyses of @xcite and @xcite . in each case",
    ", the analysis implicitly assumes that the events that occur at the approximate location of a bright star are due to lensing of the bright star and not some much fainter star at almost the same location .",
    "actually , @xcite and @xcite realized that lensing of a fainter star that is unresolved from the bright star would be relatively common .",
    "however , they presented arguments that this would increase the apparent number of bright star events , but it would also lead to shorter apparent event durations . they argued that these two effects would nearly cancel , so that these apparently severe blending effects would not lead to a large bias in the optical depth . a comparison with theory seemed to support this conclusion .",
    "these values are consistent with predictions based on the revised cobe bar model by @xcite , which has a mass of @xmath59 and the viewing angle @xmath60,and the latest cobe elongated bar model by @xcite with @xmath60 .",
    "although the optical depth results from the bright rcg sources and the fainter sources from the dia analyses are generally consistent within their error bars , the dia optical depth values are about 25% larger than the rcg values .",
    "the reason for this is not well understood .",
    "one possibility is that the difference is simply statistical , and it is just a coincidence that the two all - source analyses have given larger optical depths than the rcg analyses . @xcite and @xcite conducted detailed image level simulations on systematics due to the blending , and found that the bright rcg samples do suffer from systematic errors and suffer biases although the biases do tend to cancel at the level of the statistical uncertainties in previous work , in agreement with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite measured the galactic bulge optical depth from ogle - ii data for rcg sources with high signal - to - noise light curves , which allowed the source brightness to be determined from the microlensing light curve fit .",
    "this allowed the source brightness to be determined so that rcg  impostor \" events , with faint sources , could be excluded .",
    "this yielded an optical depth value , @xmath61 at @xmath62 , slightly higher than , but quite consistent with the macho and eros values .",
    "this value is also slightly lower than the analyses using dia photometry of events with fainter sources .",
    "this suggests that this difference in the optical depth for the bright and faint star samples might be due to some physical effect , as was seen in the models of @xcite .",
    "however , another possibility is that there is a problem with estimating the number of sources as a function of position in the bulge .",
    "while the previous discussion has focused on the microlensing optical depth , due to its simpler theoretical interpretation , the microlensing rate has a number of advantages .",
    "it is a more direct measure of the number of microlensing events that will be seen by a future space - based microlensing survey @xcite , like the exoplanet microlensing survey planned for wfirst @xcite or euclid @xcite the event rate has smaller uncertainties because it is not dominated by a small number of very long duration events .    in this paper",
    "we present a measurement of the microlensing event rate and optical depth toward the gb based on the first two years of the moa - ii survey , the second phase of the moa experiment .",
    "our analysis makes use of only high s / n events with well constrained model parameters to avoid the ambiguities due to parameter degeneracies caused by blending .",
    "we present the photometric data in section  [",
    "sec : data ] and the selection of microlensing events in section  [ sec : select ] . in section ",
    "[ sec : eff ] , we present the computation of the detection efficiency , and we present the event rate and optical depth results in section ",
    "[ sec : opt ] . in section ",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss models of the variation of the event rate and optical depth with galactic coordinates , and we discuss out results and present our conclusions in section ",
    "[ sec : summary ] ,",
    "the data set used in this analysis is same as used by @xcite .",
    "that is , it was taken in the 2006 and 2007 seasons by the moa - ii survey , with the 1.8-m moa - ii telescope located at the mt .",
    "john university observatory , new zealand .",
    "the telescope is equipped with the wide field camera , moa - cam3 , which consist of ten 2k @xmath63 4k pixel ccds with @xmath64 m pixels . with the pixel scale of 0.58 arcsec / pixel scale @xcite , this gives a 2.18 deg@xmath3 field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the median seeing for this data set was @xmath65 .",
    "the moa - ii survey is a high cadence photometric survey of millions of stars in 22 gb fields .",
    "the centers of these fields are listed in table  [ tbl : fld ] , although field 22 was not used in this analysis , due to its distance from the bulge .",
    "the data consists of @xmath66 images of each of the two most densely sampled fields , gb5 and gb9 , with a 10 minute sampling cadence , and 1660 - 2980 images of each of the 19 other fields , which were sampled with a 50 minute cadence , as indicated in table [ tbl : fld ] .",
    "this high cadence strategy is designed to detect very short events with @xmath67 days , which are expected due to lensing by free - floating planets @xcite and short planetary anomalies in the light curves of stellar microlensing events @xcite , this high cadence also increased the fraction of the events in which the lensing parameters are well constrained by the light curve fit , which is very important for precise measurements of the microlensing rate and optical depth .",
    "the images were reduced with moa s implementation @xcite of the difference image analysis ( dia ) method @xcite . in the dia method , a high quality , good seeing , reference image is subtracted from each observed image after transforming the reference image to give it the same seeing and photometric scaling as the observed image .",
    "this method generally provides more precise photometry in the very crowded galactic bulge fields than psf - fitting routines , such as dophot @xcite .",
    "this is , in part , due to the fact that the gb fields are so crowded that virtually all the main sequence stars are not individually resolved . as described in section [ sec : eff ] , the identification of a clear rcg population in the data is needed to match the observed moa luminosity function to the much deeper hubble space telescope ( hst ) luminosity function @xcite that describes the source stars .",
    "this is similar to the ogle - ii optical depth analysis @xcite that makes use of the ogle - ii extinction map @xcite , which is based on the rcg position in the color magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of each field .    each field",
    "is divided into 80 subfields and each subfield is individually calibrated using the rcg feature in each subfield cmd . for the gb22 field and some fraction of other fields , totaling about 12% of the area , a clear rcg population could not be identified in the cmd , and these regions were excluded from the analysis for this reason . the number of subfields used in the final analysis is 1536 in total and also given in table  [ tbl : fld ] for each field , where the maximum is 79 as one subfield is not useful for a technical reason . the coordinates and other information of subfields are listed in table  [ tbl : sub_eff_all ] .",
    "this lack of a clear rcg feature in field gb22 is because it is relatively far from the center of the galaxy . for the other fields , it is generally regions of very high interstellar extinction that prevented the identification of the rcg cmd feature in some of the subfields .",
    "the images were taken using the custom moa - red wide - band filter , which is equivalent with the sum of the standard kron / cousins @xmath68 and @xmath69-bands .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the moa reference images were calibrated to the kron / cousins @xmath69-band using ogle - ii photometry map of the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "the mean magnitude zero - point were estimated from the 30% of moa - ii fields which overlap with the ogle - ii map .",
    "we applied this mean zero - point to all fields .",
    "the uncertainty in the magnitudes calibrated by this procedure is estimated to be @xmath700.25 mag from the standard deviation of zero - points in overlap fields .",
    "although this calibration is approximate , it does not affect following analysis at all because the luminosity functions , which is the only part of our analysis requiring calibrated magnitudes , are calibrated by using the rcg cmd feature , as discussed in section [ sec : eff ] .",
    "we make use of the same microlensing events selected in the analysis of @xcite . the processes and criteria for event selection",
    "have been developed for that paper and are reused for the current analysis .",
    "event selection details are summarized in table s2 and section 2 of the @xcite supplementary information ( si ) .    in short ,",
    "we have selected light curves with a single instantaneous brightening episode and a flat constant baseline , which can be well fit with a point - source , point - lens ( pspl ) microlensing model given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : amp - u ] ) , with separate parameters for both the source and blend fluxes .",
    "we required that the lensing parameters are well constrained by the light curve model , including both the source and blend fluxes , with the minimum impact parameter of @xmath71 .",
    "binary lens events are excluded from this analysis with a strict cut on the @xmath72 of the pspl model .",
    "although we have identified more than a thousand microlensing candidates in this data set , only 474 high quality microlensing events have passed our relatively strict cuts on the error bars of the event parameters as determined by the microlensing model fit .",
    "these strict criteria ensure that @xmath36 is well constrained for each event and that there is no significant contamination by mis - classified events .",
    "thus , they ensure that the event rate and optical depth measurements are not significantly biased by low - level systematic errors in the event parameters .",
    "the agreement of the observed and simulated @xmath73 distributions , shown in fig .",
    "s4 in the si of @xcite support the conclusion that systematic errors or contamination by non - microlensing variability are negligible .",
    "s5 of the si indicates that the systematic bias between input and the fit @xmath36 of simulated events is @xmath74% level regardless of @xmath36 as seen in fig .",
    "s5 of si in @xcite , which also support the negligible bias in our optical depth estimates .    the number of selected events , @xmath75 , in each field and subfield are listed in tables  [ tbl : fld ] , [ tbl : sub_eff_all ] and [ tbl : sub_eff_rcg ] , respectively . in table",
    "[ tbl : candlist ] , we list the microlensing events with the best fit parameters , with the complete list available in the online , electronic edition , and a sample available in the print edition .      for the microlensing rate and optical depth estimates , we use two subsamples of events : ( 1 ) the all - sources sample , with events brighter than @xmath11 mag , and ( 2 ) the red clump giant ( rcg ) sample , the stars in the `` extended rcg region '' as shown in figure [ fig : cmd ] , which is a similar definition as previous works .",
    "this will allow us to see if there is a discrepancy as was seen in previous studies .",
    "\\(1 ) the `` all source '' sample uses all 474 events mentioned above . in this sample ,",
    "the events with the best fit source magnitude of fainter than @xmath76 mag have been rejected to avoid the possible contamination from the events with degenerate parameters .",
    "\\(2 ) the rcg sample uses 83 events with source magnitudes of @xmath77 mag and the source colors of @xmath78 mag , where @xmath79 is the @xmath80 color of rcg centroid .",
    "the rcg centroid ( @xmath80 , @xmath69)@xmath81 was identified in each subfield by a method very similar to that of @xcite .",
    "this rcg sample is similar to the ones in the previous rcg microlensing optical depth paper papers @xcite , which contain not only the bulge rcg , but also contain other bulge red giants in the `` extended rcg region '' of the cmd as shown in figure [ fig : cmd ] . because we do nt have @xmath82-band source magnitudes from the light curve models , we use the @xmath82 and @xmath69 photometry of stars on the reference image at the position of the event for the source color , @xmath83 .",
    "our event detection method on the difference images does not require the star to be associated with an apparently resolved reference image star , but we do require that fit source magnitudes are @xmath77 mag .",
    "so , in almost all cases , the bright star will be the source or the source blended with another bright star .",
    "a fraction of these bright stars and events do not have @xmath80 photometry , mostly due to high extinction , which renders the stars undetectable in the @xmath82-band .",
    "since a blue star would have to be intrinsically very bright to pass the @xmath77 mag cut in these high extinction regions , these stars are very likely to satisfy our color requirement , even though we are unable to verify that they do . in practice",
    ", we have rejected only stars that have a clear measurement of @xmath80 with @xmath84 .",
    "we have kept the rest of them , because the purpose of color cut is to reduce the contamination from foreground disk stars as much as possible .",
    "we have used this condition for both selecting events and counting source stars for our rcg sample .",
    "we use the detection efficiency determined by @xcite , as described in sections s4 of the si of that paper , but we briefly summarize our method here .",
    "the detection efficiency of our survey was determined with monte carlo simulations following @xcite .",
    "artificial microlensing events were added at random positions to the observed images , using psfs derived from nearby stars in each field .",
    "the parameters of these artificial events were uniformly generated at random in the following ranges for the impact parameter , @xmath73 , time of peak magnification , @xmath85 , einstein radius crossing time , @xmath36 , and source magnitude , @xmath86 : @xmath87 , @xmath88 jd , @xmath89days , and @xmath90 mag .",
    "( the @xmath85 range is the range of observations in this data set . )",
    "although we select only events with @xmath91 mag , we simulate stars down to @xmath92 mag in our detection efficiency calculations to take account the fact that some events with sources magnitudes that are fainter than @xmath93 mag can be selected , due to the fit uncertainty in the source magnitude values . we simulated events with up to @xmath94 for the same reason .",
    "the source magnitudes were weighted by the combined luminosity function ( lf ) from moa - ii and the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) @xcite .",
    "this uses the moa - ii lf at a subfield of gb13 - 5 - 4 for bright stars and hst for faint stars down to @xmath95 mag .",
    "( subfield gb13 - 5 - 4 is the one that contains the @xcite baade s window field . )",
    "this combined lf is calibrated to the extinction and galactic bulge distance for each subfield using the position of the rcg centroid in each cmd , because rcg stars serve as a good standard candle ( @xcite ) .",
    "subfields where the rcg feature in the cmd could not be clearly identified were not used in this analysis .",
    "once the images with artificial events were created , they were processed with the same analysis pipeline and selection criteria used for the analysis of the actual data .",
    "we evaluated our detection efficiency as a function of @xmath36 , @xmath96 , in each field by simulating 20 million artificial events as shown in figure [ fig : eff ] . for einstein radius crossing times of 1 - 50 days , the rcg efficiency is higher , as one would expect , but the rcg efficiency drops steeply for events with @xmath97days .",
    "this is an artifact of the original purpose of this analysis , which was to study the short timescale tail of the @xmath36 distribution in order to search for a population of free - floating planets @xcite .",
    "the original event selection procedure included a cut on the @xmath72 for a constant brightness fit for data outside of a 120-day window centered on the peak of the event .",
    "long duration events with bright sources are much more likely to fail this cut .",
    "in addition to the detection efficiency for each field as a function of the event timescale , @xmath96 , we have also determined the detection efficiency , averaged over @xmath36 , in each subfield , @xmath98 } { \\sum_i \\gamma(t_{{\\rm e},i})},\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is the @xmath36 distribution appropriate for each subfield .",
    "because we do not know the true @xmath36 distribution for each subfield , we use a gaussian weighted average of the observed detection efficiency corrected @xmath36 distribution for all the other subfields within 1 degree around the subfield in question .",
    "the gaussian weighting uses @xmath100 for the all - star sample , and for the rcg sample , we use @xmath101 for all sub - fields out to @xmath102 from the subfield in question .",
    "the average efficiencies for each subfield are listed in tables [ tbl : sub_eff_all ] and [ tbl : sub_eff_rcg ] for the all - star and rcg samples , respectively .",
    "these @xmath103 will be used for analysis of event rates in the next section .",
    "the average timescales for all source with 1 degree radius and @xmath104 degree are also shown in these tables and in the first panel of figure [ fig : fieldmaps ] .",
    "the microlensing event rate , @xmath39 , can be determined observationally from the following expression , @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the total number of source stars monitored for microlensing , @xmath107 is the duration of the survey in days , @xmath108 is the einstein radius crossing time for the @xmath109-th event , and @xmath110 is the detection efficiency at that time - scale .",
    "the optical depth , @xmath38 , is the probability that a random star is microlensed with the impact parameter @xmath111 at any given time .",
    "this is equivalent to the fraction of the total observing time per star that a lens is within the angular einstein radius of one of the source stars .",
    "this depends on the impact parameter , @xmath32 , but since the distribution in @xmath32 is uniform , we can use the average event duration ( defined as the time when @xmath112 ) , which is given by @xmath113 .",
    "we can substitute this average event duration into equation  [ eq : gamma ] to obtain the following expression for @xmath38 , @xmath114    a potential problem with equations  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : opt ] ) occurs if @xmath115 for some @xmath116 values . in this case , the uncertainty in @xmath39 or @xmath38 can diverge simply because we ca nt detect events for some range in @xmath36 . this problem can be corrected if we have some knowledge of the @xmath116 distribution . in practice , the main difficulty occurs when trying to measure the optical depth , where a substantial fraction of the total optical depth can come from very long duration events . for the optical depth",
    ", the uncertainty is exacerbated by the large weight given to events with large @xmath36 .",
    "some bulge events have been observed with durations of @xmath117days or more @xcite , so we add a subscript the measured values of @xmath38 to indicate the maximum duration of the events in the sample .    in our event rate and optical depth analyses for this 2006 - 2007 data",
    "set , @xmath118 days and the number of source stars is ( 1 ) @xmath119 for all star sample and ( 2 ) @xmath120 for the rcg sample .",
    "these numbers were determined as follows :    \\(1 ) for the all star case , we estimated the center of rcg @xmath69-band magnitude , @xmath121 , and the number of rcg , @xmath122 by fitting the luminosity function of the reference images in each subfield with equation ( 4 ) of @xcite .",
    "the combined lf , which is based on lf in baade s window field ( gb13 - 5 - 4 ) , are scaled and shifted so that its @xmath121 and @xmath122 are same as the values in each subfield .",
    "then the number of stars @xmath106 are counted down to @xmath93 mag by this scaled - combined lf and shown in table  [ tbl : fld ] and [ tbl : sub_eff_all ] .",
    "the advantage of this method is that @xmath122 is less affected by the blending as they are bright and the shape of lf around this range is roughly symmetric .",
    "the disadvantage is that it assumed the lf in all fields are same as that of baade s window @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) for the rcg case , we counted the the number of stars in the reference images in the extended rcg region with @xmath123 mag and @xmath124 mag , @xmath125 .",
    "they are shown in table [ tbl : fld ] and [ tbl : sub_eff_rcg ] .",
    "the advantage of this method is that we are not assuming that the lf in all fields are same as that of baade s window .",
    "the disadvantage is that , as discussed in @xcite , the number of sources that can be lensed is slightly overestimated due to blending .",
    "the blending makes the stars to be looked brighter overall , however more fainter stars are coming into the the magnitude range than brighter stars going out because the lf is the increasing function towards the fainter stars at @xmath126 mag . @xcite",
    "estimated @xmath125 is overestimated by @xmath127% by image level simulations .",
    "we rescaled @xmath125 down by @xmath128% .",
    "due to our event selection criteria ( e.g. , small @xmath72/d.o.f . for pspl fit ) , all events with significant binary lens features were removed from the sample of event used to determine the event rate and optical depth . the fraction of binary lens events among all microlensing events has been estimated at 8% ( @xcite ) , 6% ( @xcite ) , 3% ( @xcite ) , 6% ( @xcite ) .",
    "we use 6% to correct our optical depth measurement for binary lens events excluded from the sample .",
    "the event rate can be corrected by the ratio between the number of events with binary lenses and single lenses is @xmath129 . assuming that the lens system consists of two stars having the same typical time scale , the optical depth contribution of a binary lens event is @xmath130 times that of a single lens event .",
    "it follows that the optical depth values and their errors have to be rescaled by a factor 1.09 .",
    "individual optical depth estimates for all sources in each field are listed in table  [ tbl : fld ] , and shown in figure  [ fig : field ] .",
    "the second panel of figure  [ fig : fieldmaps ] shows a smoothed version of the optical depth centered at the location of each subfield .",
    "we also estimated the average optical depth in all fields combined , and found @xmath131 with 474 events for all source sample and @xmath132 with 83 events for rcg sample at @xmath133 .",
    "the effective line of sight was computed by weighting the number of subfields used .",
    "the errors were estimated using the bootstrap monte - carlo method of @xcite .",
    "the event rate formula given in equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) has the apparent advantage that it does not have any dependence on the event @xmath36 distribution to estimate the @xmath39 .",
    "but this is a bit of an illusion , because we do need to know something about the @xmath36 distribution to estimate the uncertainty in @xmath39 . with the bootstrap monte - carlo method of @xcite , we assume that the true @xmath36 distribution is just the observed @xmath36 distribution corrected for detection efficiencies .",
    "but , if we do know the @xmath36 distribution , then we can use a simpler formula for @xmath39 , @xmath134 where @xmath75 is the number of events in the sample , and @xmath135 , is the detection efficiency , @xmath136 , averaged over the assumed @xmath36 distribution , @xmath99 appropriate for each subfield as defined by equation  ( [ eq : epsilon ] ) .",

    "the `` @xmath141 '' in the above equation is because we would construct the @xmath36 distribution in the area where we can assume @xmath142 .",

    "imply that only the detection efficiency of the detected events in the subfield in question are used .",
    "so we have to enlarge the area of the subfield itself to reduce the statistical uncertainty on @xmath36 distribution , by which the signal should also be smoothed out .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : gamma - effav ] ) also has the advantage over equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) that it obeys poisson statistics , whereas equation  ( [ eq : gamma ] ) implies an unequal weighting of the different events .",

    "there are two problems with this procedure , however .",
    "first , the binning necessarily smooths out the intrinsic spacial distribution in @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",

    "this leads to large fitting errors if there are bins with 0 , 1 , or 2 events .",
    "in order to avoid these problems , we introduce a method for fitting with poisson statistics , and this allows us to fit to the raw , subfield data , even though the average number of events per subfield is @xmath147 .",

    "the faint star analyses have shown systematically larger @xmath38 values .",
    "some of the previous rcg analyses @xcite have implicitly assumed that all events occurring in the proximity of rcg stars actually had rcg sources , and then argued that blending caused relatively large errors of both signs , which happened to nearly cancel in the measurement of @xmath38 .",

    ", we have performed the photometry at the locations of the events as identified in difference images . as a result",
    ", we avoid a systematic photometry error for blended events that might affect the @xcite analysis , and our analysis method should be considered to be an improvement over the methods used for previous rcg optical depth measurements .",

    "our rcg sample gives @xmath38 values that are 30 - 40% below their predictions , but as we explain below , this is likely to be due to the dearth of long timescale events in out rcg sample .    unfortunately , there are no theoretical predictions for the event rates per star , @xmath39 , and per square degree , @xmath180 . as discussed above section  [ sec : model ] and shown in figures [ fig : fieldmaps ] , [ fig : gamma_vs_b ] , and [ fig : gamma_sq_vs_b ] , @xmath39 and @xmath180 can be measured more precisely than @xmath38 .",

    "if there are more faint stars than predicted by the @xcite luminosity function , there would be more microlensing events and a larger @xmath39 would be inferred .",
    "another significant difference between the all - source and rcg samples is their ( efficiency corrected ) @xmath36 distributions , which are shown in figure [ fig : tedistribution ] .",
    "the mean timescale of the all - source sample is larger than the mean timescale of the rcg sample .",
    "since @xmath226 , this is the reason why the all - source @xmath163 value is larger than the rcg @xmath163 value , while the @xmath39 values are consistent with each other . this may be largely due to the low detection efficiency at @xmath227 days for the bright sources in the rcg sample , which is caused by our requirement that the light curve be well fit by a constant brightness model outside of a 120-day window centered on the event peak .",
    "long duration events with bright sources will deviate significantly from a constant baseline brightness at relatively low magnification , but fainter sources can pass this cut because their photometric error bars are larger .",
    "for the all - source sample , events with @xmath228days contribute 21% to the measurement of @xmath163 , but the rcg sample has no events with @xmath229days .",

    "the cumulative histogram of figure  [ fig : tedistribution2 ] is also shown in figure  [ fig : tedistribution3 ] .",
    "this is proportional to the contribution to @xmath163 for each @xmath36 bin , and it is clear that the handful of events with @xmath229days contribute significantly to @xmath163 .",
    "this issue will be addressed in a future analysis with a much longer time baseline .",
    "it is also possible that the low latitude fields have an excess of faint stars due to contamination from stars on the far side of the galactic disk , that might also contribute the larger @xmath36 and @xmath163 values for the all - source sample .",
    "it is our goal to measure @xmath39 and @xmath38 in various directions around the galactic bulge to constrain the model parameters of the barred galactic bulge .",
    "currently moa - ii detects about 700 event per year and ogle - iv finds about 1700 events a year . in the near future , we plan to expand this analysis to include thousands of events which have been observed since the end of the 2007 observing season , which is the last season included in this paper .",
    "another goal of this work is to predict the event rate in the inner galactic bulge for the future infrared space microlensing survey of the wide field infrared space telescope ( wfirst ) @xcite , which was the top ranked large space mission in the new worlds , new horizons ( nwnh ) 2010 decadal survey .",

    "this is partly due to the relatively small area of sky covered by some of the previous microlensing surveys @xcite , but also because some of the previous surveys were designed for lmc observations and did not use a very red passband @xcite .",
    "the moa - ii survey improves this situation somewhat due to its very wide field and custom red passband that covers combined wavelength range of both the cousins @xmath68 and @xmath69-bands , but an infrared microlensing survey would be preferable .",
    "nevertheless , the measurements we present in this paper do provide the best estimate of the event rate in the inner galactic bulge to date . for @xmath14 of the moa - ii survey area inside @xmath15 and @xmath16 , centered at @xmath17 , we find @xmath230 for sources with @xmath231 .",
    "this is a factor of 1.3 larger than the rate model used for the report of the wfirst science definition team ( sdt ) @xcite evaluated at this position .",
    "however , the wfirst sdt used a different model to extrapolate to the lower latitude fields , @xmath232 , that wfirst will observe .",
    "so , the model with @xmath233 presented in figure  [ fig : gamma_vs_b_l ] predicts a 60% higher event rate than assumed in the report of the wfirst sdt @xcite .",
