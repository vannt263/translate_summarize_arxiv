    "higher gradient elasticity models are nowadays increasingly used to describe mechanical systems with underlying micro- or nano - structures ( see e.g. among many others @xcite ) or to regularize certain ill - posed problems with higher gradient contributions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "such higher gradient models , together with the more general class of micromorphic models @xcite , have been also proved to be a useful tool for the description of micro - structured materials showing exotic behaviours in the dynamic regime ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one among such higher order models which was introduced at the very beginning is the so called _ indeterminate couple stress model _ in which the higher gradient contributions only enter through gradients on the continuum rotation .",
    "we place ourselves in the context of the linear elastic , isotropic model by choosing a specific form of the quadratic free elastic energy density .",
    "the question of boundary conditions in higher gradient elasticity models has been a subject of constant attention .",
    "the matter is that in a higher gradient model , it is not possible to independently vary the test function and its gradient .",
    "some sort of split into tangential and normal parts is usually performed ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is well known in general higher gradient models .",
    "the boundary conditions in the general case of gradient elasticity and strain gradient elasticity have been settled in the paper by bleustein @xcite , see also @xcite . however , as it turns out , the boundary conditions obtained by tiersten and bleustein in @xcite with respect to the special case of the indeterminate couple stress model are not the only possible ones in the framework of the indeterminate couple - stress model .",
    "while the strain gradient framework necessitates to work with a third order hyperstress tensor , the indeterminate couple stress model is apparently simpler : it restricts the form of the curvature energy and allows to work with a second order couple - stress tensor work - conjugate to gradients of rotation . for this apparent simplification",
    "the indeterminate couple stress model has been heavily investigated and is still being heavily used as well . a first answer as regards boundary conditions has been given by mindlin and tiersten as well as koiter @xcite who established ( correctly ) that only 5 geometric and 5 traction boundary conditions can be prescribed .",
    "their format of boundary conditions has become the commonly accepted one for the couple stress model @xcite , all these papers using the same set of ( incomplete ) boundary conditions .",
    "it seems , to us , however , that the state of the art in general strain gradient theories @xcite is much more advanced as far as boundary conditions are concerned .",
    "this paper has been motivated by our reading of @xcite , in which the form of traction boundary conditions in the indeterminate couple stress model , together with an apparently plausible physical postulate lead to unacceptable conclusions , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , there had to be an underlying problem which we believe to have tracked down to the hitherto accepted format of boundary conditions .",
    "the main result of this paper , consisting in setting up a `` stronlgy independent '' set of boundary conditions for the couple stress model , has been announced in @xcite .",
    "this contribution is now structured as follows : after a subsection fixing the notations used throughout the paper , we outline some related models in isotropic second gradient elasticity and we give a brief digression concerning differential geometry . in section [ directsection ] , we present the equilibrium equations and the constitutive equations of the indeterminate couple stress model as they have been derived in the literature",
    ". we also present the classical `` weakly independent '' boundary conditions proposed by mindlin and tiersten @xcite and the main arguments of their proposal . since we remark that these boundary conditions are not the only possible ones , in section [ fromgradientbc ] we obtain the novel set of boundary conditions in the indeterminate couple stress model . to this main aim of our paper ,",
    "we follow two different paths . on the one hand , we consider the indeterminate couple stress model as a special case of the second gradient elasticity model and we derive the `` strongly independent '' boundary conditions which follow naturally as restriction of such general framework , see subsection [ sub : the - full - approach ] .",
    "this kind of approach involves the third order hyperstress tensor as a reminiscence of the second gradient elasticity approach .",
    "however , in subsection [ sub : identification-1 ] , we prove that the equilibrium equations and the boundary conditions may all be rewritten in terms of mindlin s second order couple stress tensor . on the other hand ,",
    "following the line of mindlin s argument in combination with some calculations specific to second gradient elasticity model , we set up a `` direct approach '' which leads to the same set of boundary conditions with those coming from second gradient elasticity , see section [ sectionincomplete3 ] .",
    "however , these boundary conditions do not always coincide with those proposed by mindlin and tiersten and which are accepted and used until now in the literature .",
    "we explain this fact in subsection [ newsubsectionmadeo ] where we explicitly show that , if an `` a priori '' equivalence can be found in most cases between our approach and mindlin s one , this is not the case when considering `` mixed '' boundary conditions , simultaneously assigning the force and the curl of displacement ( mindlin ) or the force and the normal derivative of displacement ( our approach ) on the same portion of the boundary .    in the appendix , we give some explicit or alternative calculations which are used in the main text and we answer again to the question : what are the missing steps in mindlin and tiersten s approach ? ( see appendix [ sectionincomplete2 ] ) .",
    "we do so by using all the arguments provided throughout the paper and pointed out in different circumstances .",
    "we end our paper by some concluding diagrams summarizing our findings .      in this paper , we denote by @xmath0 the set of real @xmath1 second order tensors , which will be written with capital letters .",
    "we denote respectively by @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 a simple and double contraction and the scalar product between two tensors of any suitable order , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 etc . ] .",

    "@xmath353 depends on the displacement field @xmath57 through the couple - stress tensor @xmath354 defined in .",
    "this means that , actually , formula does not allow to calculate _ a priori _ the force @xmath355 in our model which is equivalent to an assigned @xmath356 in mindlin and tiersten s model . of course , one could think to assign , e.g.",
    ", the boundary conditions ( ii ) and ( a ) on the same boundary , solve the associated boundary value problem so finding its solution @xmath357 and then calculate the quantities @xmath207 and @xmath358 to be assigned in our model in order to give rise to the same solution @xmath357 .",
    "the converse operation of imposing our boundary conditions ( iv ) and ( c ) in our model and then calculate _ a posteriori _ the quantities @xmath356 and @xmath359 to be assigned in mindlin and tiersten s model to obtain the same solution , can also be envisaged . in other words , we are saying that only an _ a posteriori _ equivalence is eventually possible in the case that the considered force/@xmath335 boundary conditions are applied on the boundary .",
    "this fact poses , at least , some philosophical problems by giving rise to the question : _ how to chose among mindlin and tiersten s or our mixed boundary conditions?_. this indeterminacy leaves many questions open concerning the physical transparency of higher gradient theories .",
    "the present paper gives a comprehensive analysis of the indeterminate couple stress model and of the boundary conditions arising in this theory .",
    "we have seen the indeterminate couple stress model as a special case of the full strain gradient elasticity , we have directly derived the equilibrium equations and the boundary conditions in the same spirit as in the general strain gradient elasticity approach and we have compared our approach with that proposed by mindlin and tiersten @xcite .    as a balance for the present paper we can state that an apparent inconsistency is found between the classical ( mindlin and tiersten s ) approach and our direct approach to the indeterminate couple stress model .",
    "indeed , if an `` a priori '' equivalence can be found in most cases between the two models , we point out that this is not the case when considering `` mixed '' boundary conditions for which `` forces '' and suitable combinations of first order derivatives of displacement are simultaneously assigned on the same portion of the boundary .",
    "it turns out that for such particular mixed boundary conditions an `` a priori '' equivalence can not be established between the two models .",
    "this fact poses serious conceptual and philosophical problems concerning the transparency of the physical meaning of the boundary conditions in higher gradient models .",
    "the question remains open whether the use of one model would be preferable to the other , at least for the quoted case of mixed boundary conditions .",
