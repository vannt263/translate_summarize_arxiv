    "the observation and manipulation of a few individual particles are at the core of many present experiments in atomic and molecular physics , quantum optics , quantum information , as well as in biology and chemistry . quite often , these experiments rely on high numerical aperture optics which collect a very weak fluorescence signal emitted by the particles .",
    "these optics generally operate at the diffraction limit , in order to image small objects with a high spatial resolution . as a few examples , the objects may be single ions in a paul trap  @xcite , single neutral atoms in microscopic optical dipole traps  @xcite , bose - einstein condensates in a double well potential  @xcite , or single fluorophores in a biological membrane  @xcite .",
    "the high resolution of the imaging optics allows the observation of periodic chains of ions  @xcite or arrays  @xcite of microscopic objects , with distances between them as small as a few microns .",
    "many of these experiments rely on the ability not only to observe , but also to trap and manipulate the particles .",
    "large numerical aperture optics , when diffraction limited , can focus laser beams down to sub - micron spots that can be used as sharp optical tweezers  @xcite . in atomic physics",
    ", this strong confinement can be used to trap exactly one atom in the tweezer  @xcite , with high oscillation frequencies due to the sharp focussing .",
    "using independently controlled optical tweezers simultaneously , one can control the collision between two ( or more ) individual particles  @xcite .",
    "this approach has already been implemented to investigate interactions between moving biological objects  @xcite , and offers an interesting perspective to realize quantum logic operations between few cold neutral atoms or ions  @xcite .    in the case of atoms or ions",
    ", the design of large numerical aperture optics requires to take into account the ultra - high vacuum environment that is necessary to produce and manipulate them",
    ". the optics may be either inside the vacuum chamber - and then must be bakable and vacuum compatible - or outside - but then the focussed beam must go through a vacuum window , which generally creates significant aberrations .",
    "another constraint arises from the arrangement of the trapping system surrounding the particles ( e.g. electrodes for an ion trap or laser cooling beams ) , which usually requires a long enough working distance of at least a few millimeters .",
    "these constraints add up to the requirements of large numerical aperture and diffraction limited performance , and often lead to a rather complicated design and manufacturing of vacuum compatible custom objectives .    in this article , we describe and characterize a simple optical system , based on the combination of a large numerical aperture aspheric lens placed inside the vacuum chamber , and a few standard lenses placed outside . this system combines the powerful techniques of optical tweezers and confocal microscopy to trap , manipulate and observe single ultra - cold @xmath3rb atoms .",
    "the simplicity and low cost of the design compare favorably with custom objectives based on spherical lenses  @xcite and suggest broad applicability to other fields of research where excellent spatial resolution is critical .",
    "the numerical aperture is @xmath5 and , for a fixed working distance on the order of a centimeter , it performs at diffraction limit over a large spectral range , from 700  nm up to 880  nm  @xcite .",
    "we take advantage of this property to both focus the tweezer beam at a wavelength of 850 nm , and collect fluorescence light at 780  nm through the same lens .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ section : requirements ] details the requirements of the system and describes the optical setup . in section  [ section : optical_characterization ] the performance of the tweezer",
    "is characterized using optical techniques .",
    "section  [ section : single_atom_detection ] explains how to trap and detect a single atom at the focal point of the tweezer , and section  [ section : oscillation_frequency ] how to measure the oscillation frequency of one atom in the trap .",
    "this method provides a way to probe the light field locally , and to perform an independent measurement of the laser beam waist at the focal spot .",
    "trapping a single atom in an optical tweezer leads to the following requirements for our objective lens .",
    "first , controlling the evolution of the atom , or its interactions with another atom , requires that the trap size be smaller than a few microns , i.e. that the objective be diffraction limited while having a numerical aperture as large as possible .",
    "in particular , our method for single atom trapping relies on a  collisional blockade mechanism \"  @xcite : in a very small trap , the two - body loss rate is so high that if an atom is already trapped , a second atom entering the trap leads to a fast inelastic collision and , eventually , to the loss of the two atoms .",
    "second , loading of the tweezer is performed by focussing the laser beam into a reservoir of laser cooled atoms , an optical molasses in our case . in practice , this implies that the focussing lens has a large enough working distance to allow for optical access of the cooling beams , typically at least 5 to 10  mm is desirable .",
    "third , the laser used to produce the optical tweezer is far off - resonance at 850  nm , in order to avoid heating and decoherence of the trapped atom due to spontaneous emission . on the other hand ,",
    "the atom is probed by exciting the d@xmath6 transition and collecting the fluorescence at 780  nm , with a dichroic plate separating the two radiations .",
    "since it is convenient to have both beams going through the same aspheric lens , a third requirement is that the system be diffraction limited over a broad spectral range while keeping the working distance constant @xcite .",
    "fourth , in view of future experiments using several single atoms trapped in adjacent tweezers , it is also desirable that the objective remains diffraction limited off axis , which requires a large enough transverse field .",
    "for instance , a field of view of @xmath2 m and a resolution of 2  @xmath7 m ( see below ) allows one to easily address several hundreds of traps . designing arbitrary arrays",
    "could be achieved for example by combining our large n.a .",
    "lens and a spatial phase modulator placed on the incoming laser beam  @xcite , or by using appropriate optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the requirements enumerated above can be fulfilled by combining a sufficient number of spherical lenses .",
    "this is the case for the microscope objective that we designed for our first generation experiment dedicated to single atom manipulation  @xcite .",
    "this objective consists of nine spherical lenses and has a numerical aperture @xmath8 .",
    "tight mechanical constraints and careful alignment of the lenses resulted in a diffraction limited performance with spatial resolution of @xmath9 m .",
    "the transverse field is @xmath10  @xmath7 m .",
    "the working distance is 10  mm and the objective operates under ultra - high vacuum .    for simplification and scalability purposes",
    ", we have built a second generation apparatus that uses a single commercial molded aspheric lens  @xcite with @xmath0 , a working distance of @xmath11  mm and a focal length of 8  mm .",
    "this lens is manufactured by lightpath technologies ,  inc .",
    "@xcite and is diffraction limited at 780  nm for an object plane at infinite distance , with a @xmath12  mm thick glass plate between the lens and the image focal plane .",
    "the absence of this glass plate results in an enhanced spherical aberration when operating the lens at an infinite conjugate ratio .",
    "however , we noticed that aberration - free operation can be restored by slightly defocussing the aspheric lens , and operating with weakly non - collimated beams .",
    "low numerical aperture lenses can provide such beams without introducing aberrations .",
    "this beam shaping , which is crucial for our system , was optimized by using an optical design software  @xcite .",
    "the optical setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ schema_optique_aspherix ] .",
    "the source used for the tweezer is a single mode laser diode operating at 850  nm . we focus this light into a single mode polarization maintaining fiber with an output @xmath13 .",
    "the beam at the output of the fiber is shaped by using a triplet  @xcite outside the vacuum chamber that provides a slightly converging beam .",
    "then it is injected into the vacuum chamber and onto the lens mounted under ultra - high vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the same aspheric lens is then used as an imaging system , to collect the fluorescence emitted by the atoms trapped in the optical tweezer .",
    "the collection solid angle is @xmath14 . a polarization independent dichroic plate separates fluorescence light at 780  nm from the tweezer light at 850  nm .",
    "imaging of the atomic samples is performed by using a doublet and a singlet  @xcite outside the vacuum chamber .",
    "the overall transverse magnification of the imaging system is @xmath15 , which allows imaging of our 1  @xmath7 m diameter dipole trap onto a 2  pixels@xmath16  pixels area of a ccd camera ( pixel size is 13  @xmath7m@xmath1713  @xmath7 m ) .",
    "we also use a polarization beam - splitter to collect part of the fluorescence onto an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) .",
    "once the working distance between the aspheric lens and the focal point has been fixed , the distances between the lenses shown in fig .",
    "[ schema_optique_aspherix ] can be varied along the optical axis by a few centimeters , whilst keeping the system diffraction limited .",
    "likewise , the transverse alignment of the lenses and the fiber source is tolerant within @xmath18  mm .",
    "in practice , aberrations of the optical system deform the wave front and result in energy being spread away from the central lobe of the diffraction image , thus leading to a peak intensity attenuation and to a shallower dipole trap .",
    "we quantify the amount of aberrations of the optical system by considering the ratio of the peak intensity @xmath19 in presence of aberrations to the intensity @xmath20 which would be obtained if the optical system were perfectly stigmatic ( i.e. free of aberrations ) .",
    "this ratio is called the strehl ratio  @xcite and is related to the deformation of the wave front as follows : @xmath21 here , @xmath22 denotes the root - mean - square departure of the actual wave front with respect to the ideal one , and @xmath23 is the wavelength of the radiation propagating through the system .",
    "a practical criteria is that the peak intensity attenuation @xmath24 is larger than the arbitrary value @xmath25 for the amount of aberrations to be acceptable ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "this sets an upper limit to the amount of aberrations that we tolerate in our system ( @xmath27 ) . for a system free of aberrations , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "experimentally , the optical tweezer was characterized in three steps .",
    "first , we tested the performance of the triplet and the aspheric lens separately by using a wavefront analyzer ( fizeau interferometer  @xcite ) .",
    "we find that both exhibit diffraction limited performance : @xmath30 for the triplet ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 for the aspheric lens ( @xmath0 ) , the latter being remarkable for such a large numerical aperture .",
    "the residual deformation of the wave front is due mainly to a small spherical aberration .    for the second step in characterizing the optical tweezer",
    ", we aligned the triplet and the aspheric lens and evaluated the strehl ratio @xmath24 of the ensemble by analyzing point spread functions of the system and comparing them to the ideal case , i.e. with no aberrations present . in order to record the point spread function",
    ", we used a back - illuminated sub - micron pinhole in the focal plane of the aspheric lens , in place of the cold atoms .",
    "the pinhole being much smaller than @xmath33  @xmath7 m , its intensity diagram is flat over the full aperture of the aspheric lens .",
    "the optical response of the system to this point source illumination was observed on a linear 16  bits ccd camera after magnification by a factor @xmath34 by an aberration - free objective .",
    "figure  [ psfcut](a ) shows a cross - section of the point spread function measured on axis in the best focus plane , corrected for the @xmath35 magnification of the observation objective and for the @xmath36 magnification of the @xmath37 system .",
    "the corresponding ccd image is shown on fig .",
    "[ psfimages](a ) .",
    "reversal of light propagation ensures that this actually is the point spread function of the system , had it been illuminated by an isotropic point source in the focal plane of the triplet ( see  fig .",
    "[ schema_optique_aspherix ] ) .",
    "it should be compared to the @xmath38 airy function predicted by diffraction theory .",
    "here @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the radial coordinate , @xmath0 , and @xmath41  nm . the full width at half maximum of the measured point spread function is @xmath42 m and the radius of the first dark ring is 1.06  @xmath7 m , which is in agreement with diffraction theory within a few percent .",
    "normalizing the peak intensity of the airy function to 1 , we measure a peak intensity of @xmath43 for our system ( the total flux is kept constant in both cases ) , which is a measure of the strehl ratio @xmath24 on axis . for a full characterization of the light potential that the atomic samples will explore , we also scanned the magnifying objective along the axis around the best focus position .",
    "figure  [ onaxis ] shows the measured on - axis intensity variation , corrected for the longitudinal magnification of the objective and @xmath44 system .",
    "the on - axis intensity vanishes symmetrically @xmath45 m away from the best focus position , and bright rings appear off - axis , in place of the previous dark rings ( contrast inversion ) .",
    "the full width at half maximum of the longitudinal intensity distribution is @xmath46 m , which again is in good agreement with diffraction theory .",

    ", width=302 ]    our final step in characterizing our optical tweezer was investigating the off - axis performance of our system by moving the pinhole perpendicular to the optical axis .",
    "figure  [ psfimages ] shows the point spread functions measured for a pinhole respectively on - axis and off - axis by @xmath47 m .",
    "the latter displays the characteristic v - shaped flare of a comatic aberration . since our system is nearly free of aberrations on axis , we determine its strehl ratio by directly comparing the peak intensities of images taken with an off - axis and on - axis pinhole , provided the total flux is kept constant [ see fig .  [ psfcut](b ) ] . the performance of the optical tweezer can be equivalently evaluated by plotting its optical modulation transfer function ( mtf ) that characterizes the attenuation of the various spatial frequencies present in a test object , due to the optics  @xcite .",

    "[ psfimages ] , and compares them to the frequency response of an aberration - free system with similar numerical aperture : the 2d - autocorrelation function of a circular aperture .",

    "m ( crosses ) are compared to the theoretical frequency response of an aberration - free system ( solid line ) .",
    "strehl ratio is @xmath48 on - axis , and @xmath49 off - axis.,width=302 ]    it should be noted here that the results described above were obtained by illuminating the system with spherical wavefronts , issued from a sub - micron pinhole .",
    "the situation is slightly different for our single atom tweezer , because the system is illuminated with a gaussian beam provided by an optical fiber , with a beam waist equal to the aspheric lens radius .",
    "this has two consequences  : first , the diffraction rings structure shown above is significantly damped , due to the gaussian apodization effect .",
    "second , the point spread function becomes slightly broader , with a @xmath50 increased by @xmath51 , and is neither an airy function nor purely gaussian .",
    "the optical tweezer described above is a powerful tool for manipulating single neutral atoms .",
    "the alignment of the optical tweezer onto the center region of an optical molasses of cold @xmath3rb atoms indeed results in the trapping of a single atom in the microscopic dipole trap as shown below .",
    "the optical molasses  @xcite is produced by six counter - propagating cooling beams at @xmath52  nm and a zeeman slowed beam of rb atoms  @xcite , providing a large reservoir of cold atoms ( with typical size @xmath53  mm ) surrounding the microscopic optical tweezer .",
    "we observe the fluorescence of the trapped atoms with an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) used in single photon counting mode , as well as a ccd camera with low read - out noise ( see fig .",
    "[ schema_optique_aspherix ] ) .",
    "we use an interference filter ( centered at 780  nm , with 10  nm bandwidth ) and a 400  @xmath7 m diameter pinhole in confocal configuration to reduce the background signal . the residual scattering of the 780  nm cooling beams in the vacuum chamber and on the optical table contributes for @xmath54 of this background signal , the remaining @xmath55 coming from the background fluorescence at 780  nm by the molasses itself .",
    "we estimate the overall collection efficiency of our system to be @xmath56 , taking into account the angular collection efficiency of the lens ( @xmath57 ) , the transmission of the optics and the quantum efficiency of the apd .",

    "the molasses beams and the dipole trap are continuously on .",
    "the sudden jumps in the fluorescence signal correspond to a single atom entering the optical tweezer , while the sudden drops of the fluorescence signal correspond to the atom leaving the trap due to an inelastic collision with another entering atom .",
    "the collision process occurs because it is light - assisted by the molasses beams at 780  nm ( collisional blockade mechanism ) and results in the two atoms being ejected from the trap .",
    "the absence of two - atom steps is by itself an indication that the waist of the trapping beam is no more than a few microns , since this condition is required for the collisional blockade mechanism  @xcite . in that case",
    ", the loss rate due to two - body collisions becomes huge when the trapping volume is very small , and pairs of atoms are never observed .    for the data of fig .",

    "is limited by the light - assisted collision with a second atom .",
    "it can be varied from 100  ms up to about 10  s , depending on the density of the molasses cloud .",
    "we have also measured the lifetime of the atom in the absence of the cooling light and found a @xmath69 decay time of @xmath70  s. this was measured by varying the duration @xmath71 during which the cooling beams are switched off , and measuring the probability to detect the atom fluorescence again right after @xmath71 .",

    ", we produce two tweezers by sending a second trapping beam at 850  nm at a small angle in the aspheric lens . an angle of 0.25  mrad , together with the focal length of 8  mm of the aspheric lens , results into a 2  @xmath7 m distance between the two traps .",
    "the loading of the two traps is not deterministic but we can easily find periods of time during which two atoms are present at the same time in the two optical tweezers . figure  [ doubleatomeunique ] shows a cross - section of a ccd image taken when such an event occurs .",
    "a gaussian fit to the peak signal produced by each single atom indicates a waist of @xmath76 m , which validates the performance of the tweezer system and the performance of the imaging system altogether .",

    "<S> we present an optical system designed to capture and observe a single neutral atom in an optical dipole trap , created by focussing a laser beam using a large numerical aperture ( @xmath0 ) aspheric lens . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally evaluate the performance of the optical system and show that it is diffraction limited over a broad spectral range ( @xmath1  nm ) with a large transverse field ( @xmath2 m ) . </S>",
    "<S> the optical tweezer created at the focal point of the lens is able to trap single atoms of @xmath3rb and to detect them individually with a large collection efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the oscillation frequency of the atom in the dipole trap , and use this value as an independent determination of the waist of the optical tweezer . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we produce with the same lens two dipole traps separated by @xmath4 m and show that the imaging system can resolve the two atoms . </S>"
