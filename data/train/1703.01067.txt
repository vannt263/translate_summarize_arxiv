    "the remarkable differences between the classical theories and quantum theories have long been a captivating and fruitful area of study for physicists , culminating in recent decades in the realization that such differences can used to perform a variety of useful informational tasks  @xcite .",
    "subsequent developments have led to the identification and quantification of nonclassical quantum properties such as quantum entanglement  @xcite , nonlocality  @xcite and quantum discord  @xcite .",
    "these remain intense areas of research , with new applications that exploit these nonclassical properties still being found  @xcite .",
    "a fairly recent development in the quantum resources arena is the introduction of a resource theory of quantum coherence by baumgratz _",
    "et al . _",
    "this resource theory draws its primary inspiration from a similar program that was successful in the study of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "adopting this approach for quantum coherence necessarily requires the assumption of some natural basis which is assumed to form an orthonormal set @xmath1 where states @xmath2 are typically considered to be  classical \" . since the initial proposal by baumgratz _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , other variations of such resource theories have also been explored  @xcite . for our purposes , we will limit our attention to the version originally proposed in  @xcite .",
    "recent literature have applied this resource theory to the study of a diverse range of topics , such as quantum correlations  @xcite , interferometric experiments  @xcite and quantum estimation  @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned resource theory of coherence typically considers finite dimensional quantum systems . at the opposite end of the spectrum",
    ", we may also consider its application in the infinite dimensional ( or continuous variable ) regime , of which quantum systems of light is a prime example .",
    "recent attempts to quantify the coherence in such systems have mainly focused their attention on the fock basis @xmath3 , assuming that fock diagonal states are the free  classical \" resource in the infinite dimensional regime  @xcite .",
    "this approach is however , in diametric opposition to the traditional notions of classical light based on the glauber - sudarshan p representation of the state of the electromagnetic field .",
    "indeed , fock states are decidedly nonclassical  @xcite .",
    "the most general notion of classical light have already been extensively studied since the 1960s  @xcite , and it is well established that the quantum states of light that most closely resemble classical light fields , both in photon statistics and dynamics , are the so - called coherent states  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore desirable that any quantification of quantum coherence for quantum states of light involves the set of coherent states .",
    "unfortunately , the set of coherent states is overcomplete ; in particular , the coherent states do not form a mutually orthonormal set , and therefore do not permit the direct application of the resource theoretical approach outlined in  @xcite .",
    "the question is then the following : suppose we would like to consider the coherence with respect to the set of coherent states @xmath4 , how do we quantify this and in what sense is it nonclassical ?",
    "in this paper , we propose a resolution to this problem . in so doing",
    ", we will demonstrate that the quantum resource identified by baumgratz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite is essentially the same as the notion of nonclassicality identified by glauber  @xcite .",
    "we will also demonstrate that this nonclassical resource is closely related to what we refer to as a resource theory of linear optics .",
    "we will adopt the axiomatic approach for coherence measures as shown in ref .",
    "the essential ingredients are as follows .    for a fixed basis @xmath1",
    ", the set of incoherent states @xmath5 is the set of quantum states with diagonal density matrices with respect to this basis . given this",
    ", we say that @xmath6 is a measure of quantum coherence if it satisfies following properties : ( c1 ) @xmath7 for any quantum state @xmath8 and equality holds if and only if @xmath9 .",
    "( c2a ) the measure is non - increasing under incoherent completely positive and trace preserving maps ( icptp ) @xmath10 , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "( c2b ) monotonicity for average coherence under selective outcomes of icptp : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 $ ] for all @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "( c3 ) convexity , i.e. @xmath18 , for any density matrix @xmath8 and @xmath19 with @xmath20",
    ".    we will also frequently make reference to the set of coherent states which we denote by @xmath4 .",
    "( for an overview , see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that every quantum state of light @xmath8 permits a representation that is diagonal with respect to coherent states , i.e.    @xmath21    where the coefficient @xmath22 is called the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0 distribution  @xcite .",
    "the p distribution always sums to 1 but may display negativities , in which case it is considered nonclassical . on the other hand , @xmath0 distributions that exhibit the properties of a classical ,",
    "nonnegative probability distribution are considered to have classical analogues .",
    "finally , we will also make references to _ linear optical operations _",
    ", which will require some clarification . here",
    ", we specifically take this term to refer to the set of passive unitary optical operations that can be performed using basic building blocks of beam splitters , phase shifters , half and quarter wave plates as described in ref  @xcite supplemented with displacement operations , defined by @xmath23 . in contrast , the most general linear transformation of the bogoliubov type includes operations such as squeezing operations , that can give rise to highly nonclassical light . in our context , the defining property of such a linear optical operation is that if the input quantum state is given by pure , classical light of the form @xmath24 , then the output state is also pure and classical , i.e. , if @xmath25 is a unitary linear optical operation , then @xmath26 .",
    "the key idea that we will present here is to preprocess a general quantum state using an orthogonalization procedure which shares some superficial similarities with the gram - schmidt orthogonalization procedure from linear algebra .",
    "we first illustrate the process using some orthogonal basis states , and show that this procedure , when applied to an orthogonal basis , can be interpreted as a generalization of the concept of coherence proposed by baumgratz _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "consider some orthogonal basis @xmath1 with @xmath27 in some @xmath28 dimensional hilbert space and some arbitrary quantum state @xmath29 . without any loss in generality ,",
    "we assume that the coefficients are in decreasing order , so @xmath30 .",
    "we now describe a preprocessing procedure .",
    "we define a cnot type operation performing the operation @xmath31 .",
    "suppose we perform a series of such cnot type operations starting from the basis state with the largest overlap with @xmath32 , so @xmath33 . applying this unitary , the final result is the state @xmath34 .",
    "we note that the coherence with of @xmath35 in the basis @xmath36 is the same as the coherence of @xmath32 in the basis @xmath37 .",
    "therefore , from the perspective of coherence , the preprocessing procedure is completely superfluous , and the coherence before and after the process is completely described by the same coefficients @xmath38 .    in the above example",
    ", the unitary procedure turned out to be extraneous because the initial basis states are chosen to be orthonormal .",
    "however , when the initial reference set of states is not an orthonormal set , such as when the set of states considered are the coherent states @xmath4 , then we see that the operation may not be trivial .",
    "suppose we have some initial pure state @xmath39 .",
    "if one were to similarly define a series of cnot type operations as before , with the exception that the control states are drawn from the non - orthonormal set @xmath4 , we see that the resulting state will have the form @xmath40 , where the set of states @xmath41 will be orthonormal so long as @xmath42 .",
    "we note that this orthogonality condition can always be strictly enforced by an encoding across multiple spatial / polarization modes , but for notational simplicity , we will instead use some set of sufficiently well separated coherent states within a single mode , @xmath43 , which can be chosen to be arbitrarily close to orthonormal .",
    "we now describe the orthogonalization procedure with respect to the set of coherent states in detail .",
    "following the same argument as above , let us define @xmath44 through the recursion relation @xmath45 , where the coherent state @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 and the initial state @xmath48 is some given pure quantum state of interest .",
    "given some finite series of vectors @xmath49 where @xmath50 , let the cnot type unitary be defined to be @xmath51 .",
    "this definition essentially performs the map @xmath52 . from this",
    ", we can construct the unitary map just as before : @xmath53 .",
    "we will call @xmath54 the gram - schmidt unitary , since it performs an orthogonalization process .",
    "the end result is some orthogonal subspace spanned by @xmath55 where @xmath56 . within this @xmath28 dimensional subspace",
    ", the discrete finite dimensional formulation of coherence will then apply .",
    "the following is a construction of @xmath54 which will appropriately generalize the definition for mixed states :    [ gram - schmidt unitary ] [ def::gsunitary ] for a given density matrix @xmath57 , let @xmath58 .",
    "we now define @xmath59 to be some coherent state achieving the optimal value @xmath60 , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 is a cnot type unitary .",
    "we assume that @xmath63 forms some set of mutually orthonormal vectors .",
    "let @xmath64 be some integer .",
    "then the following unitary :    @xmath65    is called the @xmath28th gram - schmidt unitary .",
    "note that in general , @xmath66 depends on the state @xmath57 .    in the case of degeneracy , where more than one coherent state may achieve @xmath67 ,",
    "the choice of unitaries above is not necessarily unique . to accommodate this",
    ", we will also define the set of all possible choices of such unitaries @xmath68 .",
    "we can also generalize to the case of multimode states by considering @xmath69 in place of @xmath46 , so that our treatment here can be made as general as possible .",
    "after the orthogonalization process , a pure state will have the form @xmath70 , where the set of states @xmath55 will be orthogonal .",
    "the vector @xmath71 represents the portion of the vector space that is not orthogonalized by the @xmath28th gram - schmidt unitary .",
    ", which we can always remove by projecting onto the subspace spanned by @xmath55 .",
    "we introduce the following quantity :    [ @xmath28-coherence ] for some discrete finite dimensional coherence measure @xmath6 , we define the @xmath28-coherence @xmath72 for a pure state @xmath32 to be :    @xmath73\\ ] ]    where @xmath74 is called the @xmath28th gram - schmidt map .",
    "the projector @xmath75 is the projection onto the @xmath28 dimensional subspace spanned by @xmath76 where the vectors @xmath49 and @xmath77 are the same vectors previously defined in definition  [ def::gsunitary ] .",

    "@xcite , with only one additional requirement .",
    "the coherence measure @xmath6 should be asymptotically continuous in the sense that if some state @xmath8 has infinitesimally small coherence , then it is infinitesimally close to some incoherent state @xmath19 .",
    "that is , if we have some sequence of states @xmath81 such that @xmath82 then for every @xmath83 , there is some @xmath84 such that for every @xmath85 , there exists some incoherent state @xmath86 such that @xmath87 .",
    "this is satisfied , for instance , by both coherence measures introduced in ref .",
    "this is because both the @xmath88 norm  @xcite and the relative entropy  @xcite are lower bounded by the trace norm .",
    "next , we define the @xmath89 smoothed version of the above quantity so as to consider states in the immediate vicinity of the state of interest .",
    "[ @xmath89 smoothed @xmath28-coherence ]    the @xmath89-smoothed @xmath28-coherence for some @xmath90 is the quantity :    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the @xmath89 ball centred at @xmath57 with respect to the trace norm .",
    "finally , the main figure of merit that we consider is the following :    [ @xmath93-coherence ] [ def::alphacoherence ]    the @xmath93-coherence is the limiting value of the @xmath89 smoothed @xmath28-coherence :    @xmath94    in definition  [ def::alphacoherence ] , we have combined the finite dimensional formulation of coherence with that of non - classical systems of light .",
    "the @xmath93-coherence may therefore be interpreted as the limiting case of the coherence identified by baumgratz _",

    ", we will argue that the @xmath93-coherence is closely related to non - classicality in the sense of negative glauber - sudarshan p distributions .",
    "here , we present the main properties of the @xmath93-coherence and its relation to traditional notions of coherence in the quantum optics literature . we first prove that , for a given state @xmath95 , a vanishing value of the @xmath93-coherence is equivalent to the existence of a glauber - sudarshan p distribution ( referred to hereafter simply as the p distribution ) for @xmath95 which is a probability density on the complex plane .",

    "we can then consider the following :    [ negativity ] let the p distribution of the of the state @xmath8 be given by @xmath226 where @xmath226 is a regular function .",
    "let @xmath227 , then then the quantity :    @xmath228    is called the negativity of the p distribution .    the following result shows that both the @xmath93-coherence and the negativity of the p distribution belong to similar resource theories , which further supports the argument that the @xmath93-coherence is closely related to negativities in the p distribution .",
    "suppose for some @xmath8 , @xmath229 is finite integrable .",
    "then @xmath230 is a non - classicality measure with respect to the set of states with positive p distributions .",
    "it is obvious that if @xmath231 for all @xmath93 , then the p distribution is classical and @xmath232 .",
    "so the first condition is automatically satisfied .    for weak monotonicity ,",
    "observe that a linear map always maps a state with classical p distribution to another state with classical p distribution .",
    "therefore , we must have @xmath233 where @xmath234 is some classical p distribution .",
    "let @xmath235 where @xmath236 is a signed measure with density @xmath226 ( the existence of such an expression follows from the fact that the set of finite linear combinations @xmath237 is trace norm dense in the set of quantum states @xcite ) .    by the hahn decomposition theorem , we define the positive subset @xmath238 and the negative subset as @xmath239 , so @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "since @xmath234 is classical and hence always non - negative , we must have that @xmath242 , which proves weak monotonicity .",
    "we now prove strong monotonicity .",
    "recall the definition of a linear optical measurement .",
    "let @xmath243 where @xmath226 may be nonclassical .",
    "any linear optical measurement may be performed by a linear optical unitary operation with classical ancilla : @xmath244 .",
    "@xmath245 is a classical non - negative distribution over @xmath156 modes .",
    "since @xmath136 is a linear optical unitary , it always maps a product of coherent states to another product of coherent states , so we can write @xmath246",
    ". since @xmath136 implements a linear optical measurement , there must exist projectors @xmath247 on the subsystem @xmath248 such that @xmath249 . expanding this expression",
    ", we get @xmath250 .",
    "we see that since the terms @xmath245 and @xmath251 in the integral are both non - negative , we can upper bound the negativity of @xmath252 by simply integrating over the entire negative subset of @xmath226 , regardless of the measurement outcomes @xmath141 . as a result , we can write    @xmath253    where the last inequality is because the sum @xmath254 is a sum of probability outcomes .",
    "this is proves strong monotonicity .",
    "convexity is also guaranteed .",
    "let @xmath226 and @xmath255 be the p distributions of @xmath8 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the p distribution of the mixture @xmath256 is @xmath257 . since @xmath258 , @xmath230",
    "must be convex .",
    "the inequality occurs because the the largest negative set @xmath259 for for mixture may be suboptimal for the individual states @xmath8 and @xmath19 .",
    "still other possible measures of nonclassicality measures can also be constructed .",
    "for instance , we can also consider geometric measures of nonclassicality .",
    "suppose we have some distance measure @xmath260 over the hilbert space that is monotonically decreasing under quantum operations over both its arguments .",
    "then it is immediately clear that the quantity @xmath261 , where the optimization is over all classical states , will satisfy at least the weak monotonicity condition laid out in definition  [ def::monotonicity ] .",
    "in this paper , we described a general procedure that allows us to quantify the superposition amongst any complete set of quantum states , whether they are orthogonal or not .",
    "the key insight here is that the scheme laid out by by baumgratz _",
    "_  @xcite can be generalized via a reasonably motivated orthogonalization procedure .",
    "this orthogonalization procedure is then applied to the set of coherent states as a special case and the resulting coherence measure , the @xmath93-coherence , is shown to identify incoherent states with nonclassical states in the sense of the glauber - sudarshan @xmath0 distribution .",
    "this demonstrates that states with nonclassical @xmath0 distributions are essentially the limiting case of the same quantum resources identified in  @xcite , when the incoherent basis is chosen as the set of coherent states .",
    "the @xmath93-coherence also belongs to a class of resource theoretic nonclassicality measures that we refer to as a linear optical resource theory .",
    "this strongly implies that linear optical monotones are appropriate measures of the nonclassicality of light .",
    "the results also suggest possible deeper connections between incoherent operations and linear optical elements that opens up potentially interesting new lines of investigation .",
