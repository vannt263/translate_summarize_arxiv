    "@xcite and @xcite have recently suggested that a class of type iil supernovae ( sne ) may be powered by the birth of a magnetar during the sn event .",
    "these sne include sn  1961f , sn  1979c , sn  1980k , and sn  1985l .",
    "in particular , @xcite argue that for a supernova with ejecta mass @xmath6 that forms a magnetar with an initial period of @xmath7 ms , the supernova can reach peak luminosities consistent with what was observed in these events . they also show that even brighter ( m@xmath8 = -21 ) events can occur , such as the ultra - bright type iil sne 2005ap and 2008es .",
    "motivated by @xcite and @xcite , we compared the time evolution of the x - ray luminosity of sn  1979c to the form expected from a magnetar - powered sn . in   2 ,",
    "we discuss sn 1979c and examine its x - ray luminosity .",
    "we find that contrary to the expectation of these papers , the evolution of this sn is not consistent with the magnetar model .",
    "additionally , we show that the x - ray emission spectrum exhibits evidence for hard x - ray emission , possibly originating from a central source .",
    "we show that the x - ray luminosity has been steady over the lifetime of the sn evolution and argue that this is due to an accreting stellar - mass black hole remnant at the center of sn  1979c .",
    "the type iil sn  1979c , discovered on april 19 1979 by g.  johnson @xcite and its host galaxy ngc 4321 ( m100 , at a distance of @xmath9 mpc ; @xcite ) have been extensively observed in the radio @xcite , optical @xcite and x - ray @xcite bands . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the h@xmath10 flux has decreased by @xmath4 35% between 1993 and 2008 , while forbidden line emission from lines such as [ ] has increased @xmath4 50% ( see figure  3 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the increase in the forbidden line emission is evidence of shock heating of the ejecta by the reverse shock .",
    "similar to the h@xmath10 emission , the radio emission also shows a decline of a factor of @xmath4 5 over the lifetime of the sn @xcite , though early observations provided evidence for quasi - periodic oscillations that may be the result of a modulation in the progenitor s circumstellar environment by a binary companion @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite noted that the in conjunction with a decrease in the radio luminosity the spectrum has begun to flatten .",
    "they note that the flattening spectrum would be expected for a supernova with emission from a compact remnant that is beginning to appear in the shell as the expanding remnant becomes increasingly transparent .",
    "they point out , however , that the flattened spectrum could also be due to synchrotron emission from the shell as electrons are accelerated to gev energies .",
    "we note that in this scenario , it would be reasonable to expect an increasing hard x - ray flux as electrons are accelerated to tev energies .",
    "more recently , @xcite presented a revised analysis of the radio expansion of sn  1979c and found that the expanding blastwave is in near free expansion with @xmath11 = 0.91@xmath120.09 for @xmath13 .",
    "this seems contrary to x - ray observations which suggest that the blastwave has been strongly decelerated by a dense circumstellar interaction @xcite .",
    "while the optical and radio emission have showed evolution over @xmath4 25 years , x - ray observations of sn  1979c show a markedly different behavior .",
    "as seen in table  [ tab:79c ] , the x - ray luminosity has remained remarkably constant over its 30 yr lifetime .",
    "@xcite suggest that type iil sne such as sn  1979c may have been magnetar powered . in the context of a magnetic dipole model , one can write the spindown luminosity as @xmath14 erg s@xmath3 for a magnetar with magnetic field b@xmath15 ( in units of 10@xmath16 gauss ) and period @xmath17 ( in units of 10 ms ) , or as    @xmath18    the observed x - ray luminosity , @xmath19 , can be expressed as some fraction , @xmath20 , of the magnetar spindown luminosity , i.e. @xmath21 . in figure",
    "[ fig : x1979c ] we plot the evolution of the x - ray luminosity for a dipole magnetar - powered sn assuming that 1 , 3 , or 10% of the spindown power is transferred into x - rays , with @xmath22 and @xmath17 = 1 .",
    "we also indicate the x - ray luminosity ( from table  [ tab:79c ] ) as observed by the _ rosat _ , _ xmm  newton _ , _ chandra _ , and _ swift _ observatories , as well as the early upper limit from the _ einstein _ observatory hri , where the model predicted x - ray luminosity is more than two orders of magnitude above the _ einstein _ upper limit . as seen in figure  [ fig : x1979c ] and also in table  [ tab:79c ] , the observed x - ray luminosity = 2.4@xmath110@xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 = 0.5 kev . ]",
    "is remarkably constant over time , with l@xmath26 = ( 6.5@xmath120.1)@xmath110@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "most importantly , even if the magnetar powered the sn only at early times , it would have likely resulted in a clear detection by the _ einstein _ observatory .",
    "the above equation applies to a magnetic dipole spindown .",
    "more generally , the magnetar luminosity can be written as    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the initial spindown time and @xmath29 for magnetic dipole spindown . at late times , @xmath30 , and for all physical values of @xmath31 the luminosity decreases with time .",
    "if the x - ray luminosity is some fraction of the spindown luminosity , the fraction will need to increase with time , potentially up to unphysical values greater than unity , in order for the observed x - ray luminosity to remain constant .",
    "the combined _ chandra _ acis - s spectrum of sn  1979c is shown in figure  [ fig:79c_acis ] .",
    "@xcite fit the _ xmm - newton _ observation to a two component thermal plasma model ( mekal model in xspec ) , with @xmath32 = 0.77@xmath33 kev and @xmath34 = 2.31@xmath35 kev .",
    "they did not find any evidence for strong absorption , with a fitted hydrogen column density @xmath36 2.5 @xmath1 10@xmath23 @xmath24 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and attribute the low temperature component to recently shocked ejecta , and the high temperature component to emission from swept  up circumstellar material ( csm ) . in their model , the shocked circumstellar emission arises from a dense wind , with densities of @xmath37 10@xmath38 @xmath39 out to radii of 0.13 pc , yielding column densities @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite argue that vlbi imaging at @xmath41 = 22 yr show no evidence for clumping in the csm , indicating that the csm is remarkably uniform .",
    "if this were the case , then both the _ xmm  newton _ and _ chandra _ acis - s spectrum would show strong absorption at low energies .",
    "we fitted the _",
    "acis - s spectrum to a two component thermal plasma model , and found that the spectrum can be described by two thermal plasmas with temperatures @xmath42 and 1.86@xmath43 kev , which shows no evidence for the level of absorption expected from the above properties of a hypothetical dense smooth csm .",
    "we note that our fitted parameters and those of @xcite are consistent .",
    "recently , @xcite reported on vlbi detection of a central source in sn  1986j .",
    "they argue that the small proper motion of the source ( 500 @xmath12 1500 km s@xmath3 ) provides evidence that the source is either a central neutron star or black hole , but they do point out that it might also be a dense csm condensate seen along the line of sight , as similar clumped regions appear in the northeastern region of the sn  1986j shell . additionally , as previously pointed out , @xcite showed that the blastwave of sn  1979c is still in free expansion , and @xcite argued that the flattening radio spectrum could be evidence for emission from a central compact remnant .",
    "we thus chose to fit the x - ray spectrum of sn  1979c as a combination of shocked plasma , either arising from shocked csm or ejecta , along with a component associated with a central source .",
    "the resultant fits are shown in figure  [ fig:79c_acis ] . in both cases",
    ", we found that the thermal component is well described by a plasma with @xmath25 = 1.1@xmath44 kev in collisional ionization equilibrium .",
    "we first modeled the hard emission as a power - law ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig:79c_acis ] ) , and found a power - law index for the flux per unit energy @xmath45 = 2.2@xmath46 .",
    "we also fit the data to a model for an accreting central black hole , using the ` kerrbb ` model in xspec , shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig:79c_acis ] .",
    "we found that the hard component of the spectrum can be well fit for a black hole mass of @xmath47 .",
    "we do note , however , that while the x - ray spectrum is well described by a spectrum from an accreting black hole , we do concede that a powerlaw fit such as that shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig:79c_acis ] is still consistent with emission from either a central compact source such as a pulsar wind nebula , or from synchrotron emission arising from shock accelerated electrons .",
    "while a two component thermal model can describe the x - ray spectrum for sn  1979c , with the hard component having a @xmath25 @xmath48 2 kev , as seen in figure  [ fig:79c_acis ] , the data are equally well described by a thermal component , either from shocked csm or shocked ejecta , and a hard spectral component , possibly from a central source .",
    "@xcite modeled the x - ray emission as arising from the expansion of the blastwave into a dense circumstellar wind , with values ranging from 10@xmath49 ",
    "10@xmath50 @xmath39 out to radii of 4@xmath110@xmath51 cm .",
    "ahead of the blastwave , the circumstellar density in their model is still 10@xmath52 @xmath39 at a distance of 1 pc ( c.f .",
    "figure  6 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which would add an absorbing column density of @xmath53 @xmath24 , well in excess of the measured absorption in the spectrum of sn  1979c .    additionally , in models for supernova remnant ( snr ) evolution where the blast wave is expanding into a wind , the x - ray ( and optical and radio ) emissivity _ from the expanding blast wave _ should decrease with increasing blast wave radius .",
    "this is because the blast wave encounters the densest material at small radii , and sweeps over less dense material as it expands to a larger volume . at the late times of interest here , the ejecta is optically thin @xcite .",
    "the free - free emission measure scales quadratically with the particle number density @xmath54 and linearly with the volume @xmath55 , so that for the typical @xmath56 radial profile of a wind , @xmath57 decreases with time .",
    "other sn remnants ( snrs ) do show evidence for a strong interaction with a circumstellar medium ( _ c.f . , _",
    "sn  1994i and sn  1993j ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sn  1993j was observed with _",
    "chandra _ in 2000 and again in 2008 .",
    "analysis of these data show that the x - ray luminosity has dropped from @xmath58 in 2000 to @xmath59 in 2008 .",
    "this sharp drop in x - ray luminosity is inconsistent with the near steady x - ray emission from sn  1979c .    a plausible explanation for the constant luminosity would be to associate it with eddington - limited accretion onto a central compact object of mass @xmath60 . based on the eddington luminosity value ,    @xmath61    with a modest bolometric correction ( _ e.g. _ l@xmath62 = 1.6@xmath110@xmath63 , l@xmath64 = 9@xmath110@xmath65 and l@xmath66 = 1.6@xmath110@xmath65 erg s@xmath3 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this implies that the accreting object has a mass of @xmath67@xmath68 , which is within the typical range associated with stellar - mass black holes @xcite .",
    "the hard component of the x - ray spectrum of the source shown in figure  [ fig:79c_acis ] is consistent with the spectrum of an eddington - limited black hole in an x - ray binary such as lmc x-3 ( see fig .  1 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and our spectral fits to the data imply a black hole mass of @xmath48 5m@xmath5 .",
    "it is plausible to expect that a black hole forms in a type iil sne . according to figure  2 of @xcite , solar metallicity stars with progenitor masses @xmath69",
    "25@xmath70 can follow a track that leads to black hole formation . @xcite also point out that 25% of low mass ( m @xmath4 20m@xmath5 ) progenitors with solar metallicity will produce black hole remnants by fallback .",
    "since @xmath4 3% of core - collapse sne are type iil @xcite , this implies that some type iil s will form a black hole remnant , consistent with predictions for theoretical black hole mass distributions from core - collapse sne @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite also suggest that type iil / b sne are produced in binaries , which would avoid the need for a fallback accretion disk in the sn @xcite as the binary companion would provide the accreting material .",
    "there has been some evidence for a binary companion to the progenitor of sn  1979c , seen as a modulation of the early time radio light curve .",
    "the existence of an accreting black hole remnant at the center of sn  1979c is consistent with the upper limit on the early x - ray luminosity established by the _",
    "einstein _ observatory . for supernova models with 25m@xmath5 of ejecta and explosion energies of 2@xmath110@xmath71 ergs ,",
    "the expanding ejecta bubble becomes optically thin to kev x - rays on a timescale of 15 yrs .",
    "the upper limit on the _ einstein _ observation may reflect that early phase of the snr evolution when the ejecta is optically thick or the time delay required to establish a stable accretion flow around the black hole remnant , which is calculated to be about twice the recombination timescale , @xmath4 1 yr @xcite .",
    "@xcite note the presence of a wolf ",
    "rayet `` bump '' in the optical emission spectrum of sn  1979c which may be associated with the progenitor .",
    "they mention that several metal  rich regions in m100 have been observed to possess wr stars @xcite , and _ hst _ imaging shows several young blue stars of age 46 myr in the vicinity of sn  1979c .",
    "photometry of the clusters stellar population yields an estimate of the progenitor s mass to be ( 18)@xmath123 m@xmath5 .",
    "this is consistent with the expected progenitors for type iil sn and with the required progenitor mass to form a black hole during the sn explosion , possibly from a fallback disk .",
    "we have also analyzed _ chandra _ and _ rosat _ observations of other two other type iil sne , sn  1980k and sn  1985l .",
    "we have found that the x - ray luminosity of sn  1979c is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of sn 1980k ( l@xmath26 @xmath72 5.5@xmath110@xmath63 erg s@xmath3 ) and sn  1985l ( l@xmath26 @xmath73 4@xmath1 10@xmath63 erg s@xmath3 ) .",
    "interestingly , the latter luminosities from these type iil sne are more consistent with a pulsar origin in young sne , such as sn  1968d , sn  1941c , and sn  1959d @xcite , in line with @xcite who point out that not all type iil s will form a black hole remnant .",
    "our analysis of archival x - ray observations of sn  1979c indicate that the x - ray luminosity has been remarkably steady .",
    "we find that the x - ray light curve is not consistent with either a model for a supernova powered by a magnetar or a model where the x - ray emission arises from a blast wave expanding into a dense circumstellar wind . in the latter case ,",
    "the observed decline in the optical and radio bands should be accompanied by a decline in the x - ray flux . the x - ray spectrum for sn  1979c",
    "can be modeled by a combination of a thermal x - ray component and emission from an accreting black hole with a mass @xmath4 5m@xmath5 .",
    "the accreting material likely originates from either a fallback disk after the supernova , or possibly from material accreted from a binary companion which is suggested by the radio light curve at early times @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the formation of a black hole in sn  1979c might have also imprinted a feature in the optical supernova light curve .",
    "@xcite recently showed that the supernova light curve can be fit by a two component model which includes a grb afterglow followed by supernova ejecta .",
    "they argued that the grb optical afterglow is produced when a jet , from the formation of the central @xmath4 2@xmath74 black hole , penetrates through the stellar envelope .",
    "we note that sn  1979c appears to be the first example of a historic supernova where there is possible evidence for a black hole remnant .",

    "we note that a deep _ chandra _ or _ xmm  newton _",
    "observation of sn  1979c could settle the issue , as it would allow for both a detailed spectral analysis of the emitted spectrum as well as a search for short term variations in the x - ray light curve , which could be seen as evidence for ongoing accretion .",
