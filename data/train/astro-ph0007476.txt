    "the derivation of the distribution of masses in gravitationally bound objects is one of the principle goals of the theory of the structure formation ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "comparing the theoretical mass function with observations provides important constraints on the cosmological models ( see e.g. bond & myers 1996 , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "rich clusters of galaxies represent a particular interesting class of objects for two reasons .",
    "firstly , they are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe and therefore represent rare events .",
    "as one of the consequences of being rare events clusters are particularly sensitive to some parameters of the cosmological models ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) . secondly , the formation of clusters is relatively simple process since it is primarily determined by the gravitational dynamics while other processes ( hydro , thermal , etc ) are less important than e.g. in the process of galaxy formation . as a result the numerical simulations of clusters of galaxies are more realistic and reliable than simulations of galaxy formation .",
    "measuring the mass function of galaxy clusters is not easy but recently a certain progress has been achieved for both optically ( see e.g. @xcite ) and x - ray ( @xcite ) selected samples .",
    "although there are systematic differences between mass functions obtained by different groups there is a general agreement in a broad sense .",
    "most of theoretical derivations of the cosmological mass function are based on the ideas of @xcite that can be summarized as follows :    * the mass fraction ( @xmath2 ) in gravitationally bound objects with masses greater than @xmath3 can be estimated as the fraction of mass satisfied the collapse condition at this scale ( @xmath4 ): @xmath5 . *",
    "the collapse condition is local i.e. it can be expressed in terms of the quantities at one point . *",
    "the quantity that determines the collapse is the linearly extrapolated filtered density contrast @xmath6 at a given point . * the value of the threshold @xmath7 that corresponds to the collapse of a spherical top - hat model with the similar initial density contrast .",
    "it was assumed that the collapse of the spherical top - hat model approximately corresponded to the virialization of the gravitationally bound clump .",
    "the mathematical aspects of the press - schechter formalism is outlined in the following section . here",
    "i would like to discuss briefly some of ideas suggested since the formalism was proposed in 1974 .",
    "the excursion set approach ( @xcite , @xcite ) justified the assumption that @xmath5 in the case of a sharp @xmath8-space filter .",
    "many realized that the threshold @xmath9 does not provide the best fit to n - body simulations .",
    "although some authors used the canonical value ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) others preferred the lower values : @xmath10 ( bond & myers 1996 ) , @xmath11 ( @xcite ) , or even as low as @xmath12 ( @xcite and @xcite ) . recently shapiro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the virialization of the top - hat model occurs when linear extrapolation of the density contrast reaches @xmath13 .",
    "one of the major efforts in reduction of the discrepancy of the theory with simulations has been related to incorporating the anisotropic character of gravitational collapse .",
    "@xcite developed a model that incorporated both the zeldovich approximation on large scales and the collapse of a homogeneous ellipsoid on the nonlinear scale .",
    "@xcite suggested a different collapse condition that corresponded to the collapse along the first axis in the zeldovich approximation .",
    "@xcite incorporated some of the nonlinear effects into an anisotropic collapse model .",
    "@xcite suggested to use the collapse condition corresponding to the collapse along all three axes as described by the extrapolation of the zeldovich approximation .",
    "@xcite obtained an analytic fit to the numerical mass function in the scdm , ocdm and @xmath14cdm models and then @xcite provided a semianalytic derivation of the formula assuming an anisotropic collapse an incorporating some nonlocal effects .",
    "all but one models mentioned above assumed that the formation of a gravitationally bound object is related to the collapse along three axes .",
    "only @xcite assumed the collapse condition corresponding to the collapse along only the first axis .    in this",
    "talk i briefly review the press - schechter formalism .",
    "then i describe the derivation of the mass function ( @xmath15-function ) in the zeldovich approximation .",

    "i briefly discuss the results of comparison of the @xmath15-function with n - body simulations .",
    "finally , i discuss the effect of the initial gravitational potential on the cosmological mass function and show that the clusters have a significant tendency to form in the troughs of the initial gravitational potential .",
    "the mass function @xmath16 is the number density of gravitationally bound clumps with masses between @xmath3 and @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath2 be the fraction of the mass contained in the gravitationally bound objects with masses greater than @xmath3 .",
    "press and schechter ( 1974 ) suggested the fraction @xmath2 and the mass function @xmath16 can be related as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the mean mass density in the universe and the minus sign reflects the fact that @xmath20 is a decreasing function of @xmath3 .",
    "press and schechter also made the assumption that the fraction of mass @xmath2 can be estimated as a fraction of mass @xmath4 in the initial density field filtered with the window function @xmath21 ( corresponding to @xmath22 in @xmath8-space ) @xmath23 satisfying the collapse condition @xmath24 . here",

    "press and schechter argued that a fluid element becomes a part of a gravitationally bound object of mass @xmath3 when its linearly extrapolated density contrast @xmath38 reaches the critical value @xmath39 .",
    "this corresponds to the collapse of the top - hat spherical perturbation having the initial density contrast similar to the fluid element in question .",
    "the collapse of a spherical top - hat model has been assumed approximately to correspond the virialization of the clump .",
    "recently shapiro et al .",
    "( 1999 ) showed that the virialization corresponds to @xmath40 rather than to @xmath41 .",

[ mf - f ] ) .",
    "one obvious problem with this result is that the normalization integral @xmath45 meaning that only a half of the mass is contained in the gravitationally bound clumps .",
    "press and schechter renormalized @xmath16 by introducing an additional factor of 2 ( @xmath46 ) @xmath47}.",
    "\\label{ps_function}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    later , the normalization problem was correctly resolved in the frame of the excursion set model ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the derivation of press and schechter did not take into account the so called cloud - in - cloud problem .",
    "function @xmath4 in eq.[mass_fr ] gives the fraction of mass that satisfies the collapse condition at the filtering scale @xmath3 .",
    "however , some of the fluid particles may satisfy the collapse condition at larger filtering scales . in the correct model the fluid elements",
    "must be assigned to the clumps of mass @xmath48 being equal to the largest filtering mass at which the collapse condition is fulfilled . in the excursion set formalism",
    "this corresponds to the first crossing of the collapse threshold @xmath49 while @xmath50 evolves with the growth of @xmath51 .",
    "an elegant method to normalize the mass function was suggested by @xcite ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) who derived the integral equation @xmath52 that relates the fraction of the fluid elements firstly crossed the collapse threshold at the filtering scale @xmath48 ( @xmath53 ) and the fraction of mass satisfying the collapse condition at filtering scale @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "function @xmath54 is the probability that a fluid particle firstly crossed the collapse threshold at the scale @xmath48 satisfies the collapse condition at the scale @xmath3 . in the case of the sharp k - space filter and gaussian @xmath55",
    "this probability is exactly equal to @xmath56 for all @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the integral equation ( [ int_eq ] ) can be immediately solved for the mass function @xmath16 .",
    "the solution is the correctly normalized mass function of eq .",
    "[ ps_function ] .",
    "the simplest theory describing the anisotropic character of the gravitational collapse in a generic case of random initial condition is the zeldovich approximation ( @xcite , see also @xcite for a discussion ) . in particular",
    ", the zeldovich approximation provides a formula for an anisotropic collapse of a fluid element @xmath58[1 - d(t ) \\lambda_{2}({\\bf q})][1 - d(t)\\lambda_{3}({\\bf q } ) ] } , \\label{z_appr}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the linear growth function and @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the eigenvalues of the initial deformation tensor . using the ordering convention @xmath61 and @xmath62 the condition",
    "@xmath63 has been interpreted as a collapse of a fluid particle along one principle axis ( @xcite ) .",
    "similarly the conditions @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) can be interpreted as collapses along the second and third principle axes .",
    "@xcite showed that the formation of gravitationally bound clumps was the best correlated with the maxima of the smallest eigenvalue ( @xmath15 ) of the initial deformation tensor .",
    "although the formation of the clumps may be also related to other pointlike singularities ( @xcite ) here we assume that a fluid particle becomes a part of a gravitationally bound clump of mass @xmath3 when its smallest eigenvalue @xmath15 reaches the critical value @xmath66 at the largest filtering scale @xmath3 ( lee & shandarin 1998a ) . the zeldovich approximation ( eq.[z_appr ] ) predicts that the collapse condition is @xmath67 ( it is assumed that @xmath26 normalized to @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the present time ) .",
    "however , because of multistreaming effect all fluid particles ( except the set of measure zero ) enter the multi - stream flow regions before they collapse .",
    "we approximately incorporate this complex effect by reducing the threshold @xmath66 to a smaller value .",
    "the comparison with the press - schechter mass function as well as with the numerical mass function suggests that @xmath70 is a reasonable choice .",
    "the derivation of the mass function in the zeldovich approximation is similar to the press - schechter derivation except that the collapse condition is @xmath71 instead of @xmath72 .",

    "[ variance ] . integrating @xmath77 over two eigenvalues one can obtain the pdf of one of the eigenvalues .",
    "we are interested in the collapse along the third axis and therefore @xmath78 is of primary interest @xmath79 repeating the derivation of the previous section using the pdf of eq.[p_lam3 ] instead of eq.[p_del ] one arrives to an analog of the normalization integral equation ( eq.[int_eq ] ) @xmath80 here @xmath81 is the fraction of mass where @xmath82 on the filter scale @xmath3 .    solving exactly eq.[int_eq_l ]",

    "@xcite used the limiting value @xmath86 and analytically derived the mass function in the zeldovich approximation @xmath87    in the following sections i compare the obtained result with the press - schechter and sheth - mo - tormen mass functions as well as with numerical simulations .",
    "both the press - schechter and @xmath15-mass functions have a common factor @xmath88 which depends on the initial spectrum and @xmath89 that completely characterizes a model .",
    "thus , comparing different models is convenient by comparing @xmath90 as functions of @xmath51 .",
    "the press - schechter and @xmath15-functions are @xmath91 sheth and tormen ( 1999 ) and sheth , mo and tormen ( 1999 ) derived a new mass function that fits better the results of the n - body simulations @xmath92 \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}\\frac{\\sqrt{a}\\delta_c}{\\sigma^2 } \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a\\delta_c^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right),\\ ] ] here @xmath93 , @xmath94 and the constant @xmath95 found from the normalization condition @xmath96 choosing @xmath97 , @xmath98 and the constant @xmath99 one obtains the press - schechter function .",

    "the scale of the initial potential @xmath123 does not depend on any ad hoc scale ; the dependence on @xmath124 is extremely weak ( @xmath125 for the harrison - zeldovich spectra assumed here ) .",
    "the geometry of the gravitational potential does not evolve much on large scales ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the potential at present is very similar to the primordial one on scales much greater than the scale of nonlinearity .",
    "a simple explanation to this in the frame of the standard scenario of the structure formation is due to the fact that the mass has been displaced by the distance about @xmath126 ( @xcite ) .",

    "in the talk i discussed new modifications of the press - schechter theory of the cosmological mass function . one assumes a different collapse condition that implies that a fluid particle becomes a part of a gravitationally bound object after it experiences collapses along three axes . the comparison with other models ( fig .",
    "1 ) shows that it predicts about 25% more gravitationally bound clumps than the sheth - mo - tormen model in the range @xmath142 where the comparison with the n - body simulations has been done . a direct comparison with the n - body simulations ( fig",
    ". 2 and 3 ) shows a quite good agreement although not as good as the sheth - mo - tormen model .",
    "the @xmath15-function based on the zeldovich approximation has been obtained analytically similarly to the press - schechter function .",
    "a drawback of the derivation is a quite crude approximation of the probability function @xmath54 in the normalization integral eq.[int_eq_l ] .",
    "a more accurate normalization will be reported separately .",
    "the sheth - mo - tormen model also suffer from a normalization problem : the shape of the mass function has been derived but the normalization has been enforced by demanding equality of eq.[norm ]    another modification is the conditional mass function showing that the clusters of galaxies tend to form in the troughs of the initial gravitational potential and avoid the peaks of the potential .",
    "the gravitational potential field has a typical scale of about @xmath143 and as a result has an advantage of being independent of the arbitrariness of the smoothing scale ( if the filter scale is smaller than roughly @xmath144 ) and at present it has almost same geometry as at the epoch of decoupling .",
