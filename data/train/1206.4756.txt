    "as explained in @xcite , the periodicity of the floquet propagator in @xmath9 allows us to map the dynamics of a kicked particle on a line onto the dynamics of a fictitious ensemble of kicked particles each on a circle , with every such particle representing the dynamics for a different @xmath15-component of the kicked particle on the line .",
    "each such particle on the circle is thus referred to as a @xmath15-rotor .",

    "( [ betapropagator ] ) lacks translational invariance in momentum , so the entire derivation in the previous section will not apply and we hence do not expect to see quantized momentum transport in the @xmath15-rotor dynamics",
    ". however , for small @xmath15 values , it is reasonable to expect that evolution of the special initial state in eq .",
    "( [ specialstate ] ) will still show quantized transport up to a good approximation .",
    "we find that this is indeed the case , as evidenced in fig .",
    "5(a ) , where we see that for @xmath15 values up to @xmath214 , the quantized transport still survives for @xmath215 , @xmath94 . experimentally , however , the initial states prepared are typically a mixture of states with @xmath15 values following a narrow gaussian distribution peaked at @xmath14 . hence , to gauge the experimental feasibility of our proposal , we computed the transport values for a range of @xmath15 values near @xmath47 and took the average of these values weighted with a gaussian peaked at @xmath47 .",
    "we found that for a gaussian distribution with standard deviation of @xmath214 , the change in momentum expectation value divided by @xmath216 for the 3 bands at @xmath217 for a 100-period adiabatic cycle are @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath218 for bands 1,2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "in other words , the quantization of transport is still observable even with a realistic spread over @xmath15 values .",
    "this indicates that the small @xmath15 spread in current cold - atom experiments based on bose - einstein condensates should not hinder the observation of quantized transport in momentum space .",
    "next , we briefly consider the effects of small deviations in the planck constant @xmath31 for the same 3-band case considered above with @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "certainly , even a slight change in @xmath31 should cause the floquet - band structure to change entirely ( recall that the floquet band structure depends on whether @xmath31 is rational or irrational ) , but physical observables should not be as sensitive as the band structure itself . indeed , as seen in fig .",

    "this does not alter the original state significantly because its probability is tightly concentrated about @xmath226 ( more than @xmath227 % of the original state s probability lies within @xmath225 $ ] ) . with this truncated state as our starting point , we consider two noise models . in the first model ,",

    "we now present in fig .",
    "6 two simple numerical examples for band 1 and band 3 , with @xmath95 , @xmath232 , and @xmath233 .",
    "it is seen that in both models , the total momentum transport over one cycle ( divided by @xmath216 ) , when averaged over the 1000 realizations of the random noise , changes only slightly from the quantized value ( @xmath234 ) despite the rather strong noise . the fair robustness to imperfection to initial state shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) is partially due to the fact that our initial state is dominated by very few momentum components .",
    "indeed , the fluctuations in the total momentum transport from realization to realization , as manifested by the plotted error bars for band 3 , are much smaller than those for band 1 , consistent with the fact that our initial state for band 3 turns out to be more localized than that for band 1 .",

    "note the unusually big changes of chern numbers across some critical points.,width=529,height=272 ]    in this section , we wish to emphasize that our topological characterization of the floquet bands using chern numbers is equally applicable to cases with more bands . here",
    "we show a case with 7 bands , with @xmath237 .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "7 the chern number results as the kicking strength increases .",
    "the associated chern numbers are found to be symmetric about the central band , so we need only display 4 bands .",
    "the same qualitative features as we observed in the 3-band case are seen here .",
    "in particular , all bands other than the central band have chern number @xmath234 for low kicking strength , with the central band having a chern number equal to the negative of the sum of the chern numbers of all other bands . at band collisions ,",
    "the chern number of each band jumps by a multiple of @xmath238 for @xmath239 . for this reason",
    "we see that the chern numbers can rapidly become very large integers , which is a quite interesting feature for our system .",
    "we have also carried out adiabatic transport studies for this case . due to the smaller band gaps for the 7-band case ,",
    "we need to have longer @xmath6-cycles ( i.e. , @xmath6 must be varied from @xmath47 to @xmath24 over a larger number of periods ) in order for effective adiabatic following to take place . experimentally speaking ,",
    "this case is hence of less interest .",
    "however , in our numerical studies , other than the longer adiabatic cycles , the results are qualitatively the same as the 3-band case presented in the main text .",

    "<S> our study is much different because ( i ) this work is based on an explicit physical implementation of momentum - space periodicity , ( ii ) here the bloch phase in position space is fixed at @xmath14 in theory ( so as to obtain hofstadter s butterfly floquet spectrum ) , and ( iii ) our floquet bands are defined on a 2-torus that involves one experimental parameter , a key starting point for our theory below .    </S>",
    "<S> we now seek the implications of the floquet - band chern numbers by considering an adiabatic cycle during which @xmath6 increases from @xmath47 to @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> we first construct an initial state of the following form , @xmath48 which represents an equal - weight superposition of all the floquet eigenstates of band @xmath41 with @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> this coherent superposition state , which can be interpreted as a wannier function in momentum space , uniformly samples all the bloch eigenstates with different values of @xmath38 ( but all with @xmath30 ) , with a profile localized in the momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , each eigenstate @xmath49 is infinitely extended in momentum space , but @xmath50 is normalized to unity ( localized in momentum space with gaussian - like tails in all the cases we studied ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that because each eigenstate @xmath51 is defined only up to a global phase , one is free to choose an overall phase convention of @xmath52 such that the superposition state in momentum space tends to be well - localized , thus making experimental preparation of the initial state easier . </S>",
    "<S> such states can be highly localized so long as @xmath7 is not too large . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the shown superposition state in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) mainly occupies one momentum eigenstate , with small weights distributed over only a few nearby components . given previous experiments where momentum superposition states in the same context were prepared @xcite , states as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) should be reachable in experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> consider then an adiabatic change in @xmath6 , through a discretized protocol @xmath53 for @xmath54 , so that @xmath6 completes one adiabatic cycle at @xmath55 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> assuming adiabatic following of the floquet states , the state evolved from @xmath50 [ see eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ initialstate ] ) ] should stay as a superposition state at @xmath56 , with each component still being the eigenstate of @xmath37 , with @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , at @xmath58 , under adiabatic approximation the associated time - evolving state of the system becomes @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the sum of a dynamical phase and a geometrical phase accumulated by the component starting from @xmath49 . as a consequence of choosing @xmath49 to be a periodic function of @xmath38 , @xmath60 is also necessarily periodic in @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> next we evaluate @xmath61 , namely , the momentum expectation value on the state @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> to proceed we first write floquet eigenstates @xmath63 as the product of two parts using the bloch theorem , namely , @xmath64 , with @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we then define @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the @xmath27-element state @xmath67 is an eigenstate of the following @xmath68 reduced floquet matrix @xmath69 with @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> lengthy but straightforward calculations @xcite then yield a compact expression for @xmath71 , i.e. , @xmath72 . to compare this expectation value with its preceding value for @xmath73 </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a first - order perturbation theory so as to rewrite @xmath74 in terms of @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , to the first - order of @xmath76 , we have @xcite @xmath77 the change in momentum expectation value ( denoted by @xmath78 ) over the period from @xmath79 to @xmath80 can now be calculated to the first order of @xmath81 , @xmath82 further substituting eq .   into eq .   </S>",
    "<S> yields @xmath83 where @xmath84 is identified as the berry curvature @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 on @xmath6 and @xmath38 all suppressed for brevity .    </S>",
    "<S> the total change in momentum expectation value from @xmath88 to @xmath80 is denoted by @xmath89 . because @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 where we have used @xmath25 and @xmath92 is exactly the chern number of the @xmath41th floquet band , whose surface integral expression is @xmath93 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , eq .  ( [ finaleq ] ) reveals that the net change in the momentum expectation value over one adiabatic cycle of @xmath6 ( starting from state @xmath50 ) is quantized : it should be proportional to the chern number of the @xmath41th extended floquet band . </S>",
    "<S> this is our central theoretical result .    </S>",
    "<S> c +   +    it is necessary to numerically verify our theoretical insights above . </S>",
    "<S> detailed results are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ transport_numbers ] , again for the case of @xmath94 , with the adiabatic cycle lasting for @xmath95 periods ( in this case , see also fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) for the final momentum space profile ) or @xmath96 periods . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , apart from the regime of @xmath46 values near the critical point @xmath97 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) , our numerical values of @xmath98 almost perfectly match the chern numbers . </S>",
    "<S> this is the case before or after the jumps of the chern numbers . </S>",
    "<S> the insets of both panels depict how @xmath99 builds up with time and eventually reaches integer values that match the chern numbers . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we have checked numerically that if we repeat the adiabatic cycle , then the same quantized increase in momentum expectation value is obtained @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are thus witnessing a clear quantization effect in acceleration as an outcome of floquet band topology . </S>",
    "<S> note however , in the vicinity of phase transition points , e.g. , @xmath100 , momentum space transport is no longer quantized . </S>",
    "<S> this is because if a topological phase transition is about to occur , then the associated band gaps are not large enough to guarantee adiabaticity . supporting this understanding , a comparison between fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ transport_numbers ] ( b ) and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ transport_numbers](a ) shows that a longer adiabatic cycle indeed significantly narrows down the non - quantization window . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical data suggests that at least for the 3-band case here , if the driving field strength @xmath46 is far away from the phase transition points , then only 50 - 100 kicking periods ( depending on @xmath46 ) will be needed to observe quantized acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> this is experimentally motivating , because floquet state manipulation itself is a topic of much theoretical interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the robustness of this quantization against perturbations is also examined in appendix @xcite . in short , for the 3-band case above </S>",
    "<S> , the quantization effect can tolerate about 0.5% uncertainty in @xmath31 and a nonzero @xmath15 around 0.01 , which should be achievable in light of previous experiments @xcite .    in conclusion , based on extended floquet bands </S>",
    "<S> , we have exposed topological phase transitions in driven quantum systems and demonstrated how quantized adiabatic transport in momentum space may emerge from floquet band topology . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results based on a cold - atom - based dynamical model suggest that future experimental verification of our results is possible in terms of initial state preparation , adiabatic cycle implementation , and the robustness of quantization .    </S>",
