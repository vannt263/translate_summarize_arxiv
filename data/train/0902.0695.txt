    "@xcite , many information / disturbance tradeoffs have been derived in a wide range of frameworks @xcite . despite this variety ,",
    "all tradeoffs were derived based on figures of merit defined as average over some ensemble , e.g. the uniform ensemble of all transformations .    in this paper , following the suggestions contained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we study the behavior of a _ single _ quantum operation in some simple cases , along the following lines . after reviewing the probability of transforming a pair of pure states to another given pair @xcite , we extend it to mixed target states , and then we provide a tradeoff between the probability and the fidelity of such a transformation",
    ". finally , we present the probability - fidelity tradeoff in the inversion of an atomic ( i.  e. single - kraus ) quantum operation .",
    "we are given an ensemble @xmath0 of two pure states @xmath1 with equal _ a priori _ probabilities @xmath2 , and a pair of ( generally mixed ) target states @xmath3 .",
    "we want to find a quantum operation which realizes the transformation @xmath4 maximizing the mean probability of success over the ensemble .    for pure final states @xmath5",
    "the problem has been solved in ref .",
    "@xcite :    [ thm - pairtrans ] the maximum mean probability is @xmath6 moreover , this probability is achieved with a balanced transformation , i.e. a transformation occuring with equal probability on both initial states .",
    "indeed , the above proposition can be extended also to final mixed states .",
    "[ thm - pairmixtrans ] for generally mixed final states @xmath3 the maximum mean probability is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the uhlmann fidelity @xcite .",
    "moreover , the probability is achieved with a balanced transformation .",
    "suppose we have a quantum operation @xmath9 realizing the transformation @xmath10 with certain probabilities @xmath11 .",
    "using the ozawa dilation theorem @xcite for quantum instruments we can realize the quantum operation in the following way @xmath12\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is any pure state of an anciallary system , @xmath14 is a unitary system - ancilla interaction , @xmath15 is an orthogonal projector , and we take the trace on the ancilla .",
    "since unitaries and projectors can not turn a pure state into a mixed one , the quantum operation @xmath9 , when applied to the our initial states @xmath1 , will have the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 are joint ancilla - system states and @xmath11 are the success probabilities .",
    "note that @xmath17 are actually purifications of the final states @xmath3 .    in this way we proved that every state transformation @xmath18 can be realized with a transformation between pure states @xmath19 followed by a partial trace .",
    "thus , in order to maximize the probability of @xmath20 it is not restrictive to search only among those transformations which take @xmath1 into purifications of the final states @xmath3 .    from uhlmann s theorem",
    "@xcite we have that @xmath21 for all the purifications of @xmath3 , and thus @xmath22 from the previous proposition we already know that the maximum probability for @xmath19 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn - chefles ] ) and thus the upper bound holds @xmath23 this bound can be achieved by choosing the purifications @xmath24 which give the equality in equation ( [ eqn - uhl ] ) .",
    "the transformation is balanced by the previous proposition .",
    "let us consider now the transformation @xmath25 by proposition [ thm - pairtrans ] we know that it can be realized _",
    "exactly _ only probabilistically .",
    "but if we allow also _ approximate _ transformations , realized by quantum operations which transform @xmath1 into states @xmath3 _ close _ to @xmath26 @xmath27 we may be able to implement the transformation with greater probability , or even deterministically .",
    "in general , there are two figures of merit characterizing the transformation : ( 1 ) the probability of success , ( 2 ) the fidelity between the target states and the states actually obtained .",
    "intuitively , the more we try to tilt the pair @xmath1 towards the target states , the less the transformation is likely to happen .",
    "the figures of merit are defined as follows @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the minimum probability and @xmath30 is the minimum fidelity over the two states ( a _ worst - case _ criterion ) .",
    "each transformation is characterized by a pair @xmath31 , the set of all transformations thus being in correspondence with a subset of @xmath32 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] .",
    "our task is to determine the frontier of this permitted subset , thus finding the transformations maximizing both figures of merit .",
    "we can restrict our attention to approximated target states @xmath3 having the same two - dimensional support , equal to the linear span of the target states @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , exploiting the kraus representation for @xmath9 @xcite ( with kraus operators @xmath34 ) and defining the unnormalized states @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 we note that we can apply unitary operators @xmath37 after the kraus operators @xmath34 without altering the probabilities , obtaining new states @xmath38 @xmath39 whose fidelity with the target states is @xmath40 thus , in order to have @xmath41 for @xmath42 supported on the span of @xmath43 , we only need to show that , given a pair of vectors @xmath44 , there is always a unitary transformation @xmath14 moving @xmath44 in the span of @xmath33 such that @xmath45 the operator @xmath14 can be costructed in the following way .",
    "let us consider the component of @xmath46 orthogonal to @xmath47 .",
    "we rotate it into the one - dimensional subspace of @xmath48 orthogonal to @xmath47 . in this way",
    ", we have moved the four vectors in a three - dimensional space without changing the relevant scalar products @xmath49 .",
    "the intersection @xmath50 is one - dimensional , thus we can rotate the components of @xmath44 orthogonal to @xmath51 into the one - dimensional subspace of @xmath52 orthogonal to @xmath51 .",
    "this rotation leaves all vectors in a two - dimensional space and increases the modulus of the scalar products @xmath53 .    the section of the bloch ball containing the initial pair @xmath1 and the target pair @xmath33 .",
    "the shadowed area contains all the states @xmath3 with fidelity @xmath54 . ]",

    "@xmath62 denotes a point in the unit ball @xmath63 and @xmath64 is the vector of pauli matrices . in the bloch representation",
    "the fidelity between the states @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( with bloch vectors @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) becomes @xcite @xmath69 which , when one of the two states is pure simplifies as follows @xmath70    the angle between vectors @xmath71 @xmath72 and the angle between vectors @xmath73 @xmath74 are both minimized for the pair @xmath75 coplanar with the pair @xmath76 , and with the same symmetry axis .",
    "this relative position of the couples of vectors can be achieved by a rotation of the couple @xmath75 in the bloch sphere , corresponding to a unitary transformation which leaves the probabilities @xmath11 invariant .",
    "now , for each operation @xmath9 realizing a certain transformation @xmath77 where @xmath78 are coplanar with @xmath33 , we can construct an operation @xmath79 acting in the following way @xmath80 where we have chosen the basis of the representation such that @xmath81 is the @xmath82-rotation around the symmetry axis of the pair @xmath83 , i.  e. @xmath84 . the second term in r.h.s .",
    "is simply the `` mirror image '' of @xmath9 .",
    "this new quantum operation is symmetric since @xmath85 and behaves better than the original one w.r.t both figures of merit in eqs .",
    "( [ p ] ) and ( [ fidel ] ) , since @xmath86    thus , the frontier of the set of permitted couples @xmath31 can be determined considering only symmetric transformations .",
    "notice that w.l.o.g .",
    "we can assume the initial states @xmath1 to be in the symmetric configuration coplanar with @xmath33 ( with @xmath87 close to @xmath88 and @xmath89 close to @xmath90 ) , since this can be always achieved by a rotation of the pair , corresponding to an additional unitary transformation , which does nt change probabilities . in the @xmath31 plane this configuration corresponds to the point @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "now , let @xmath93 be the fidelity we want to achieve , with @xmath94 . then",

    "[ fig - circle ] , where @xmath96 are pure states such that @xmath97 .",
    "we claim that among such states , the most probably attainable final configuration is the pair @xmath96 . in order to prove the claim , we need to prove that the probability @xmath98 reaches the maximum at the pair @xmath96 , over any symmetric pair @xmath3 inside the area . the fidelity @xmath99 for states compatible with the constraints @xmath100",

    "the remaining part of the optimal tradeoff curve can now be completed quite easily ; we only need to sweep the pure states in the arc between @xmath1 and @xmath33 to obtain the points in the @xmath31-plane connecting @xmath91 and @xmath104 , where @xmath105 . after a little trigonometry",
