    "the habitats of animal populations are often geographically divided into many small patches , either because of human interference or because natural habitats are patchy .",
    "understanding the dynamics of such populations is a problem of great theoretical and practical interest .",
    "isolated small patches are often extinction prone , for example because of inbreeding in combination with demographic and environmental stochasticity @xcite . when the patches are connected into a network by migration , local populations may still be prone to extinction , but the whole population may persist because empty patches are re - colonised by migrants from surrounding occupied patches . moreover ,",
    "when the migration rate is sufficiently large , local populations can be stabilised by an inflow of immigrants ( the rescue effect ) . given a model of such a population ,",
    "the main concern is usually to find out how the different parameter values in the model affect the growth and persistence of the metapopulation .    in levins model , the metapopulation dynamics",
    "is simplified by treating each patch as either occupied or empty @xcite .",
    "the rates of patch colonisation and extinction are expressed as functions of the total fraction of occupied patches in the population . in its simplest form levins model",

    "spatially explicit models the parameters are chosen to be functions of for example the number of occupied neighbouring patches @xcite .",

    "many of the mechanisms that can be observed in natural populations ( e.g. allee and rescue effects ) can be represented by suitable modifications of eq .  , and",
    "the qualitative behaviour of such models is well understood @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "models that describe the metapopulation dynamics in terms of the fraction of occupied patches have no explicit connection to the population dynamics within each patch . in other words , it is not apparent how individual births , deaths , and migration events translate into colonisation and extinction rates @xcite .",
    "an alternative line of analysis focuses on the population dynamics within a single patch @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that birth and death processes , emigration , and immigration can be modelled explicitly in terms of the number of individuals in the patch .",
    "this makes the model much more immediate in terms of biological processes ( such as density dependence and allee effects ) , but the rest of the metapopulation is reduced to a background source of immigrants ( assumed to be stationary ) and is not explicitly modelled .",
    "several authors have attempted to bridge the gap between detailed local population dynamics and the dynamics at the overall population level . @xcite estimated rates of colonisation and extinction events in levins equation from individual - based simulations .",
    "this method rests on the assumption that eq .",
    "( [ eq : levinsmodel ] ) is an appropriate description of the metapopulation dynamics .",
    "@xcite has investigated the extinction risk of metapopulations subject to strong dispersal , that is , in a limit where migration is faster than the local population dynamics within patches .",
    "as pointed out above , the converse is commonly assumed in writing eq .  . within his model",
    ", @xcite addressed the question of how the degree of fragmentation of the metapopulation affects its risk of extinction .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and others have analysed the equilibrium states and possible persistence of metapopulations in models consisting of infinitely many patches with local dynamics coupled via a migration pool ( reviewed in * ? ? ?",
    "the assumption that there are infinitely many patches is crucial in these studies , as it makes it possible to pose the question under which circumstances the metapopulation persists _ ad infinitum _ , that is , for which choice of parameters the metapopulation dynamics reaches a non - trivial stable equilibrium . for finite metapopulations , by contrast , there is no stable equilibrium corresponding to persistence ( for a review of stochastic extinctions in biological populations , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as is well known , finite populations must eventually become extinct ( unless they continue to grow ) .",
    "this fact is referred to as the merciless dichotomy of population dynamics by @xcite .",
    "moreover , it remains unclear how the equations employed in these studies are related to eq .",
    "( [ eq : levinsmodel ] ) .",
    "in this paper we characterise the dynamics of metapopulations with a large , but finite , number of patches .",
    "we derive , from first principles , how the stochastic metapopulation dynamics determines the distribution of individuals over patches .",
    "the only critical assumption in our derivation is that the number of patches is large enough .",
    "especially , it is not necessary to assume that the typical number of individuals per patch is large .",
    "neither is it necessary to assume a time - scale separation between local and migration dynamics .",
    "we show that our results represent the typical transient of the metapopulation towards a quasi - steady state ( if such a state exists ) .    on the brink of extinction ,",
    "that is , close to the bifurcation point where an infinite metapopulation ceases to persist , we use a systematic expansion of an exact master equation in powers of @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the number of patches ) to find the most likely path to extinction , as well as the leading contribution to the time to extinction . in this case",
    "( close to the bifurcation ) the metapopulation dynamics simplifies considerably : it can be approximated by a simple , one - dimensional dynamics .",
    "this fact is a consequence of a general principle @xcite stating that a dynamical system close to a bifurcation exhibits a ` slow mode ' : a particular linear combination of the dynamical variables is found to relax slowly , and the remaining degrees of freedom relax much more quickly and may be assumed to be in local equilibria .",
    "in other words , when the dynamical system is in a perturbed state , the slow mode evolves towards the equilibrium state on a longer time - scale than the fast variables do .",
    "this renders the dynamics effectively one - dimensional .",
    "we find the slow mode of the metapopulation dynamics and show how it depends on the properties of the local dynamics ( given by the local growth rate and the local carrying capacity ) .",
    "the slow mode determines the stochastic dynamics of finite metapopulations as well as the deterministic dynamics of metapopulations consisting of infinitely many patches . in the latter case",
    "we find that the slow mode obeys eq .",
    "( [ eq : levinsmodel ] ) .",
    "we derive how the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 depend on the parameters determining the life history of the local populations .",
    "we show , however , that the variable @xmath0 is in general not given by the fraction of occupied patches as envisaged by levins .",
    "but it turns out that @xmath0 approaches the fraction of occupied patches in the limit of large carrying capacities and large local growth rates ( this is the limit of time - scale separation mentioned above ) .    in other words , we have derived levins model , eq .",

    "( [ eq : levinsmodel ] ) is still valid ( close to the bifurcation ) even when there is no time - scale separation between the local and the migration dynamics .",
    "this is the consequence of the existence of a slow mode .",
    "@xcite have suggested an elegant stochastic generalisation of levins model , in an attempt to compute how the local patch dynamics affects the properties of the quasi - steady state of the metapopulation ( and the average time to extinction of this population ) . their main idea is to connect the extinction and colonisation rates in eq .",
    "( [ eq : levinsmodel ] ) to local processes .",
    "the extinction rate is calculated as the inverse expected time to extinction of a single patch at the carrying capacity ( which is determined self - consistently ) , and colonisation is defined as the rate of a single migrant arriving to an empty patch , seeding a population that grows to the carrying capacity .",
    "this scheme is persuasive but not rigorous .",
    "the predictions of @xcite have , to our knowledge , never been tested by comparisons to results of simulations of stochastic , individual - based metapopulation models .",
    "therefore it is important that our approach allows us to compute the rates of extinction and colonisation from first principles . in the limit of large patch",
    "carrying capacities and close to the bifurcation we obtain expressions ( exact in the limit we consider ) that are very similar , but not identical , to the relations proposed by @xcite .    in summary , we characterise the stochastic dynamics of metapopulations on the brink of extinction . using an expansion of the exact master equation describing the stochastic dynamics with the number @xmath5 of patches as a large parameter",

    "the dynamics reduces to a deterministic model .",
    "the equilibrium properties of this model were analysed by @xcite , and by @xcite .",

    "@xmath11 the parameter @xmath12 is the birth rate per individual , @xmath13 is the density - independent per capita mortality , and @xmath14 determines the carrying capacity of a single patch . for simplicity , we take @xmath15 hereafter ( this corresponds to measuring time in units of the expected life - time of individuals in the absence of density dependence ) . the parameters occurring in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rates],[eq : dr ] ) are listed in table  [ tab:1 ] , which summarises the notation used in this article .",
    "in addition to the local population dynamics , the number of individuals in each patch can change because some individuals emigrate from their patch to other patches , or because immigrants arrive from other patches .",
    "following @xcite , the migration process is modelled as follows : individuals emigrate from a patch at rate @xmath16 , where @xmath9 is the population size in the patch in question ( @xmath17 ) . if the individuals migrate independently and with constant rates , @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath9 : @xmath18 more complex migration patterns can be incorporated .",
    "if for example individuals moved to avoid overcrowding , the emigration rate would be density dependent .",
    "the emigrants enter a common dispersal pool , containing the migrants from all patches that have not yet reached their target patch .",
    "each migrant stays an exponentially distributed time in the pool , with expected value @xmath19 , before reaching the target habitat , which is chosen with equal probability among all patches .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "migration may fail if the individuals die before reaching the new habitat ; this is modelled by the rate @xmath20 of dying during dispersal . in practice ,",
    "the probability of successful migration depends on the background mortality of the individuals , on the time the migrating individual spends in the dispersal pool , and on additional perils individuals may be exposed to during dispersal ( e.g. increased risk of predation due to lack of cover , etc . ) . in summary",
    ", if there are @xmath21 migrants , @xmath22 individuals leave the dispersal pool per unit of time , and the rate of immigration to a given patch is @xmath23 .      in the direct numerical simulations",
    ", the population evolves in the following manner .",
    "first , at any given time , the local rates , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rates]-[eq : rates2 ] ) , sum to a rate of the next locally generated event , @xmath24 , for patch @xmath25 .",
    "this rate is simply the sum of the local rates , eqs .",

    "if patch @xmath25 contains @xmath9 individuals then we have : @xmath26 the sum of these rates over all patches , @xmath27 , for @xmath28 , yields the rate for the next event occurring in the population .",
    "thus the simulation proceeds by generating an exponentially distributed random number with expected value @xmath29 .",
    "second , at each time step , a patch is chosen with probability @xmath30 .",
    "third , the type of event is chosen randomly : birth with probability @xmath31 , death with probability @xmath32 or emigration with @xmath33 .",
    "fourth , the numerical experiments described below were performed in the limit @xmath34 and for @xmath35 .",
    "this means that emigrating individuals are immediately assigned to a randomly chosen patch ( possibly the one they come from ) .",
    "a natural and commonly adopted approach to describe stochastic population dynamics is to derive a master equation @xcite for the change in time of the probability @xmath36 of observing @xmath37 individuals in the first patch , @xmath38 individuals in the second patch , @xmath39 and of observing @xmath21 individuals in the migrant pool .",
    "recently this approach was adopted by @xcite to describe the dynamics of local birth - death processes coupled by nearest - neighbour interactions ( diffusion ) .    in the following",
    "we pursue a different approach . since the local population dynamics is assumed to be the same within all patches , it is sufficient to count the number of patches with a given number of individuals rather than keeping track of the number of individuals in each patch",

    "the time derivative of the probability @xmath43 of observing the system in a given state @xmath44 at time @xmath45 , is the rate of arriving to a given state from other states , minus the rate of transitions to other states .",
    "thus , we find the master equation for the probability @xmath46 by considering all possible transitions between the states of the population , contributing to the change of @xmath46 .    for example , consider the effect of local births on the probability of finding the system in a given , focal state @xmath44 at time @xmath45 .",

    "such an approach was suggested by @xcite . in the following",
    "we briefly describe the similarities and differences between our asymptotic result and the approach suggested by @xcite .",
    "as already pointed out in the introduction , their analysis rests on four main assumptions : first , @xcite consider the limit of fast local dynamics and slow migration ( time - scale separation ) . in our model",
    ", this corresponds to the limit @xmath264 and to large values of @xmath12 .",
    "second , @xcite argue that the extinction rate in the stochastic model for the evolution of the number of occupied patches is given by the inverse time to extinction of a single patch , initially at carrying capacity .",
    "third , it is assumed that the rate of successful colonisation is given by the product of the expected number of migrants and the probability that an empty patch invaded by one migrant grows to its ( quasi-)steady state .",
    "fourth , @xcite allow for the possibility that the number of individuals per patch in occupied patches changes as the metapopulation approaches extinction , and argue that this effect can be incorporated in terms of @xmath0-dependent rates @xmath398 and @xmath399 .",
    "here we have shown , however , that in the limit of small values of @xmath60 the dynamics of @xmath76 on the most likely path to extinction is rigid : @xmath76 does not change its shape , just its normalisation .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the average number of individuals on occupied patches must remain unchanged as extinction is approached .",
    "this is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : colorprob]a .",
    "we note , however , that fig .",
    "[ fig : colorprob]b shows that for larger values of @xmath60 , @xmath76 does change its shape ( and the average number of individuals in occupied patches decreases as extinction is approached ) .",
    "a first - principles theory for this effect is lacking .",
    "we refer to this point in the conclusions .",
    "let us now consider the parameterisations of the rates @xmath3 and @xmath2 suggested by @xcite , eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in their paper .",
    "we have obtained analytical results in the vicinity of the bifurcation ( that is , for small values of @xmath60 ) . in order to compare our results to the choices adopted by @xcite",
    "we must take the limit @xmath264 . in this limit , it turns out , that the terms of order @xmath249 ( and higher ) in the second and third rows of eq .",
    "( [ eq : le0 ] ) are negligible compared to the terms in the first row . in the limit of large values of @xmath14",
    "we therefore conclude : @xmath400 the asymptotic expressions for @xmath251 and @xmath252 are given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : a11_a12_asy ] ) . in appendix",
    "[ app : c ] we have shown that these relations correspond precisely to the asymptotic @xmath14-dependence of the time @xmath401 to extinction for a single isolated patch at carrying capacity . in the limit of large @xmath14 (",
    "which is the limit @xcite consider ) we thus have : @xmath402 this equation implies that the rate of extinction of patches in the coupled system does not depend upon @xmath60 to leading order in @xmath60 . in other words ,",
    "patches go extinct independently in the limit @xmath264 .",
    "( [ eq : etk ] ) closely resembles eq .",
    "( 4 ) in @xcite .",
    "now consider the rate of successful colonisation . in the limit of @xmath268 ,",
    "the probability of a single patch growing from one migrant to carrying capacity is @xmath403 ( see appendix [ app : c ] ) .",
    "immigration is irrelevant in this context since the local patch dynamics is assumed to be much faster than migration . using this expression for @xmath404 and ( [ eq : mcexpand ] ) for @xmath160 we find the following expression for @xmath2 @xmath405 this result closely resembles eq .",
    "( 3 ) in @xcite .",
    "we emphasise that our results are exact in the limit of small values of @xmath60 and large values of @xmath5 and @xmath14 .",
    "a further but minor difference is that @xcite employ the diffusion approximation to evaluate their eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "this approximation fails unless @xmath12 is close to unity .",

    "most results presented in this paper concern metapopulation dynamics close to the critical line shown in the left panel of fig .  [ fig : mc ] .",
    "the reason is that the metapopulation dynamics simplifies substantially in this regime , as shown in the preceding sections .    in this section",
    "we briefly discuss another limit of the metapopulation dynamics in the model introduced in section  2 , the limit of large emigration rates .",
    "this limit corresponds to the top part of the @xmath103-@xmath14 plane shown in the left - most panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : mc ] .",
    "the limit is interesting for two reasons .",
    "first , in this limit too the metapopulation dynamics simplifies substantially .",
    "we show that the dynamics can be represented in terms of a one - dimensional process ( just as eq .",
    "( [ eq : levinsmodel ] ) and the corresponding stochastic dynamics ) .",
    "but now the variable is the total number of individuals in the metapopulation and not @xmath237 , or @xmath0 .",
    "second , the results allow us to connect the subject and the results of the present paper to recent results by @xcite .    in the limit of infinite emigration rate ( @xmath410 ) and no mortality during migration ( @xmath35 ) , the metapopulation behaves as a single large patch with modified birth and death rates that depend only on the total number of individuals in the metapopulation .",
    "this makes it possible to compute the average time to extinction exactly .",
    "this limit could describe , for example , biological populations in which larvae disperse randomly to all patches ( e.g. pelagic marine species ) .",
    "we start from the individual - based , stochastic metapopulation model introduced in section  2 , in the limit @xmath411 and for @xmath35 .",
    "there are @xmath5 patches .",
    "it is convenient to characterise the state of the metapopulation by the number of individuals in each patch @xmath412 ( rather than by the numbers @xmath74 denoting the fraction of patches with @xmath41 individuals as in the preceding sections ) .",
    "since migration is infinitely faster than any other process , migration instantly brings the distribution of @xmath413 to multinomial form . denoting the total number of individuals in the metapopulation by @xmath414",
    ", we see that after a birth ( @xmath415 ) or death ( @xmath416 ) , the distribution instantaneously relaxes to the multinomial distribution : @xmath417 0 & \\mbox{otherwise . }",

    "( [ eq : rates ] ) and ( [ eq : dr ] ) , conditional upon @xmath414 . for the birth rate",
    "we find @xmath420 by virtue of @xmath421 .",
    "for the death rate we find : @xmath422 these rates ( we take @xmath423 as before ) define a one - dimensional , one - step birth - death process , that can be written in terms of a one - dimensional one - step master equation @xmath424 for the probability @xmath425 of finding @xmath414 individuals in the metapopulation at time @xmath45 .",

    ", it was necessary to employ a large-@xmath5 expansion before the dynamics could be reduced to the one - dimensional form ( [ eq : levinsmodel ] ) on the brink of extinction .",
    "the results ( [ eq : bn]-[eq : masterminf ] ) allow us to investigate the question addressed by @xcite , namely how the risk of extinction depends upon the degree of fragmentation of a metapopulation , in the limit of infinite emigration rate .",
    "we define the total carrying capacity of the metapopulation @xmath427 and ask how the average time of extinction depends upon @xmath5 , keeping @xmath428 constant . in other words , we fragment the metapopulation into @xmath5 patches of equal size , such that the total carrying capacity remains the same . figure  [ fig : textinfm ] shows how the average time to extinction depends on the degree of fragmentation , for three different values of @xmath428 ( 100 , 500 , and 1000 ) , for @xmath429 ( other parameter values give qualitatively similar results ) . the initial number of individuals is taken to be @xmath430 ( the average time to extinction depends only weakly on the initial number of individuals , provided this number is larger than @xmath428 ) .",
    "the analytical results ( lines ) are in good agreement with results , for large emigration rates , of direct numerical simulations of the model introduced in section  2 .",

    "( symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : textinfm ] ) is estimated from @xmath204 independent simulations .",
    "we find that the time to extinction decreases monotonically as the degree of fragmentation increases . for small degrees of fragmentation , the time to extinction is approximately independent of the number of patches , but for larger levels of fragmentation , the time to extinction decreases markedly as fragmentation increases .",

    "error bars correspond to 95% confidence intervals . ]    since the time to extinction is approximately exponentially distributed , this implies that the probability of extinction during a given time span increases monotonically as the metapopulation becomes more and more fragmented .",
    "this result is in qualitative agreement with the findings of @xcite for intermediate and large degrees of fragmentation .",
    "by contrast , when the number of patches is small , @xcite observes a decrease in the extinction risk with increasing fragmentation .",
    "a possible reason for this difference is that @xcite considers local environmental fluctuations that would increase the local rate of extinction compared to demographic fluctuations alone @xcite .",
    "this could be important when the number of patches is low , but when the number of patches is large the fluctuations are averaged over and may become less important .",

    "we have derived explicit expressions for the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 in terms of the parameters describing the local population dynamics , and migration .",
    "we have shown that levins model is valid independently of whether or not there is a time - scale separation between local and migration dynamics .",
    "the crucial condition is that the metapopulation is close to extinction .",
    "we note that in the absence of time - scale separation , the interpretation of the variable @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : levinsmodel ] ) is no longer the fraction of occupied patches .",
    "more precisely , @xmath0 corresponds to the fraction of occupied patches if the growth rates and local carrying capacities are large enough ; otherwise it has a different meaning , in particular , for small growth rates and carrying capacities it approximately corresponds to the average number of individuals per patch .",
    "the deterministic limit of our model corresponds to metapopulation models discussed by @xcite and @xcite , who have studied the persistence of infinitely large metapopulations by analysing the stability of steady states .",
    "the corresponding persistence criteria ( which we discuss in detail ) do not allow to characterise the persistence of finite metapopulations .",
    "by contrast , the stochastic dynamics derived and analysed in this paper makes it possible to characterise the most likely path to extinction and to estimate the average time to extinction of the metapopulation .",
    "we have discussed differences and similarities between a particular asymptotic limit of our results , and the results obtained by @xcite .",
    "[ fig:15 ] summarises different limiting cases of our results , and connections to earlier studies .    while our approach results in a comprehensive description of metapopulation dynamics for the model we consider ,",
    "many open questions remain .",
    "a technical point is that we have not yet been able to compute the pre - factor @xmath145 in the expression ( [ eq : expns ] ) for the average time to extinction .",
    "this is a difficult problem requiring matching the solutions found in this paper with corresponding solutions valid for small values @xmath40 ( the number of patches with @xmath41 individuals ) .",
    "such solutions are outside the scope of our large-@xmath5 treatment .",
    "many results derived in this paper are valid close to the critical line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc ] , that is on the brink of extinction .",
    "the reason is that the metapopulation dynamics simplifies considerably in this regime , as we have shown in this paper .",
    "further work is required in order to understand metapopulation dynamics for emigration rates much larger than the critical value . in this case , especially when the number of migrants is large , we have observed deviations from levins model : the shape of the distribution of local patch population sizes is no longer rigid on the path to extinction .",
    "biologically this reflects , for example , the rescue effect , whereby immigration from colonised patches extends the time to local extinction . a quantitative theory of this effect based on the life history of the individuals in the metapopulations is currently lacking .",
    "there is , however , a second limit of our individual - based , stochastic metapopulation model that can be analysed in a simple fashion .",
    "this is the limit of very large emigration rates , @xmath410 , where the metapopulation is well mixed , so that , in the absence of mortality during migration , it can be modelled as a single large patch . in this limit",
    "it is possible to analyse the question posed by @xcite , namely how the risk of extinction of a metapopulation depends on the degree of its fragmentation .",
    "in the limit of large emigration rates , we have derived the expected time to extinction for our individual - based stochastic metapopulation model .",
    "we find that the time to extinction decreases as the degree of fragmentation of the population increases .",
    "there is excellent agreement between this prediction and results of direct numerical simulations of the model introduced in section  2 , for large but finite emigration rates . for highly fragmented populations , our conclusions are consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "when the number of patches is small , by contrast , @xcite observes a different behaviour ( discussed in sec .",
    "[ app : d ] ) .",
    "a possible reason for this difference is that @xcite considers local environmental fluctuations .",
    "these would increase the local rate of extinction compared to demographic fluctuations alone @xcite .",
    "this could be important when the number of patches is low .",
    "but when the number of patches is large the fluctuations are averaged over and are thus expected to be less important . to understand the differences and similarities between the models ( and their biological implications )",
    "requires further work .",
    "the approach described in this paper allows us to address many other important questions in metapopulation dynamics .",
    "consider for example the dynamics of structured metapopulations .",
    "core - satellite models @xcite of metapopulations have two types of patches , large and small .",
    "large patches have more persistent populations , while populations in smaller patches are relatively ephemeral .",
    "thus , the large patches are , on average , sources and the small patches are sinks for the metapopulation as a whole .",
    "such models can be treated by suitable generalisations of the approach described in the present paper .",
    "another important question is the role of environmental fluctuations .",
    "the within - patch population dynamics in our model takes demographic fluctuations into account , but does not explicitly incorporate the effect of local environmental fluctuations .",
    "such fluctuations may be due to , for example , yearly fluctuations in growth rates , mortality , or carrying capacity @xcite .",
    "the environmental fluctuations may be local , affecting patches independently .",
    "alternatively the fluctuations of the rates may be global , that is , the same for all patches ( or at least highly correlated ) .",
    "what is the effect of local environmental fluctuations ? consider the set of patches with @xmath41 individuals .",
    "one may expect that , when the number of patches is large , only average rates enter into the deterministic equations of motion ( [ eq : det ] ) .",
    "but the environmental noise gives rise to fluctuations , and therefore leads to shorter persistence times of individual patches .",
    "this in turn implies higher patch turnover @xcite .",
    "when the patches are few , the destabilising effect of local environmental fluctuations on patches can significantly affect the time to extinction @xcite .",
    "the tendency of local environmental fluctuations to increase patch turnover could be represented in our model by introducing a separate process to the local population dynamics , whereby patches go extinct at a fixed rate , independently of the local population size , for example in terms of the ` killing ' process @xcite .",
    "the theory outlined in this paper then makes it possible to determine the effect of this process upon the time to extinction of the metapopulations .    global environmental fluctuations , affecting all patches simultaneously ,",
    "can be incorporated in our model by introducing a time - dependent contribution @xmath438 to the death rate in eq .",
    "( 3 ) , the same for all patches . taking this to be a random piecewise - constant function of time",
    "makes it possible to employ the approach described by @xcite .",
    "last but not least , it is necessary to compare the predictions summarised here with those of models with an explicit spatial structure .",
    "we expect that the predictions summarised here should be the more accurate the wider the spatial scale of migration is .",
