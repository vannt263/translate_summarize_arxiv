    "what is a quantum state ?",
    "since the earliest days of quantum theory , the predominant answer has been that the quantum state is a representation of the observer s knowledge of a system  @xcite . in and of itself , the quantum state has no objective reality  @xcite .",
    "the authors hold this information - based view quite firmly  @xcite . despite its association with the founders of quantum theory , however , holding this view does not require a concomitant belief that there is nothing left to learn in quantum foundations .",
    "it is quite the opposite in fact : only by pursuing a promising , but incomplete program can one hope to learn something of lasting value .",
    "challenges to the information - based view arise regularly , and dealing with these challenges builds an understanding and a problem - solving agility that reading and rereading the founders can never engender  @xcite . with each challenge successfully resolved , one walks away with a deeper sense of the physical content of quantum theory and a growing confidence for tackling questions of its interpretation and applicability .",
    "questions as fundamental and distinct as `` will a nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics be needed to quantize gravity ? ''  @xcite and `` which physical resources actually make quantum computation efficient ? ''",
    "@xcite start to feel tractable ( and even connected ) from this perspective .    in this paper",
    ", we tackle an understanding - building exercise very much in the spirit of these remarks .",
    "it is motivated by an apparent conundrum arising from our own specialization in physics , quantum information theory .",
    "the issue is that of the _ unknown _ quantum state .",
    "there is hardly a paper in the field of quantum information that does not make use of the idea of an `` unknown quantum state . ''",
    "unknown quantum states are teleported  @xcite , protected with quantum error correcting codes  @xcite , and used to check for quantum eavesdropping  @xcite .",
    "the list of uses , already long , grows longer each day .",
    "yet what can the term `` unknown quantum state '' mean ?",
    "in an information - based interpretation of quantum mechanics , the term is an oxymoron : if quantum states , by their very definition , are states of knowledge and not states of nature  @xcite , then the state is _ known _ by someone  at the very least , by the describer himself .",
    "this message is the main point of our paper .",
    "faced with a procedure that uses the idea of an unknown quantum state in its description , a consistent information - based interpretation of quantum mechanics offers only two alternatives :    * the owner of the unknown state  a further decision - making agent or observer  must be explicitly identified . in this case , the unknown state is merely a stand - in for the unknown _ state of knowledge _ of an essential player who went unrecognized in the original formulation . * if there is clearly no further decision - making agent or observer on the scene , then a way must be found to rexpress the procedure with the term `` unknown state '' banished from the formulation . in this case , the end - product of the effort is a single quantum state used for describing the entire procedure  namely , the state that captures the describer s state of knowledge .    of course ,",
    "those inclined to an objectivist interpretation of quantum mechanics  @xcite  that is , an interpretation where quantum states are more like states of nature than states of knowledge  might be tempted to believe that the scarcity of existing analyses of this kind is a hint that quantum states do indeed have some sort of objective status . why would such currency be made of the unknown - state concept were it not absolutely necessary ? as a rejoinder , we advise caution to the objectivist : tempting though it is to grant objective status to all the mathematical objects in a physical theory , there is much to be gained by a careful delineation of the subjective and objective parts .",
    "a case in point is provided by e.  t. jaynes @xcite insistence that entropy is a subjective quantity , a measure of ignorance about a physical system .",
    "one of the many fruits of this point of view can be found in the definitive solution @xcite to the long - standing maxwell demon problem @xcite , where it was realized that the information collected by a demon and used by it to extract work from heat has a thermodynamic cost at least as large as the work extracted @xcite .",
    "the example analyzed in detail in this paper provides another case .",
    "along the way , it brings to light a new and distinct point about why quantum mechanics makes use of complex hilbert spaces rather than real or quaternionic ones  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the method we use to prove our main theorem employs a novel measurement technique that might be of use in the laboratory .",
    "we analyze in depth a particular use of unknown states , which comes from the measurement technique known as _ quantum - state tomography _  @xcite .",
    "the usual description of tomography is this .",
    "a device of some sort , say a nonlinear optical medium driven by a laser , repeatedly prepares many instances of a quantum system , say many temporally distinct modes of the electromagnetic field , in a fixed quantum state @xmath0 , pure or mixed .",
    "an experimentalist who wishes to characterize the operation of the device or to calibrate it for future use might be able to perform measurements on the systems it prepares even if he can not get at the device itself",
    ". this can be useful if the experimenter has some prior knowledge of the device s operation that can be translated into a probability distribution over states .",
    "then learning about the state will also be learning about the device .",
    "most importantly , though , this description of tomography assumes that the precise state @xmath0 is unknown .",
    "the goal of the experimenter is to perform enough measurements , and enough kinds of measurements ( on a large enough sample ) , to estimate the identity of @xmath0 .",
    "this is clearly an example where there is no further player on whom to pin the unknown state as a state of knowledge .",
    "any attempt to find a player for the pin is entirely artificial : where would the player be placed ? on the inside of the device the tomographer is trying to characterize @xcite ?",
    "the only available course for an information - based interpretation of quantum - state tomography is the second strategy listed above  to banish completely the idea of the unknown state from the formulation of tomography .",
    "to do this , we take a cue from the field of bayesian probability theory  @xcite , prompted by the realization that bayesian probability is to probability theory in general what an information - based interpretation is to quantum mechanics  @xcite . in bayesian theory ,",
    "probabilities are not objective states of nature , but rather are taken explicitly to be measures of credible belief , reflecting one s state of knowledge .",
    "the overarching bayesian theme is to identify the conditions under which a set of decision - making agents can come to a common belief or probability assignment for a random variable even though their initial beliefs differ  @xcite . following that theme is the key to understanding tomography from the informational point of view .",
    "the offending classical concept is an `` unknown probability , '' an oxymoron for the same reason as an unknown quantum state .",
    "the procedure analogous to quantum - state tomography is the estimation of an unknown probability from the results of repeated trials on `` identically prepared systems , '' all of which are said to be described by the same , but unknown probability .",
    "the way to eliminate unknown probabilities from the discussion , introduced by bruno de finetti in the early 1930s @xcite , is to focus on the equivalence of repeated trials , which means the systems are indistinguishable as far as probabilistic predictions are concerned and thus that a probability assignment for multiple trials should be symmetric under permutation of the systems . with his _ classical representation theorem _ , de finetti @xcite showed that a multi - trial probability assignment that is permutation - symmetric for an arbitrarily large number of trials  de finetti called such multi - trial probabilities _",
    "exchangeable_is equivalent to a probability for the `` unknown probabilities . ''",
    "thus the unsatisfactory concept of an unknown probability vanishes from the description in favor of the fundamental idea of assigning an exchangeable probability distribution to multiple trials .",
    "this cue in hand , it is easy to see how to reword the description of quantum - state tomography to meet our goals .",
    "what is relevant is simply a judgment on the part of the experimenter  notice the essential subjective character of this `` judgment''that there is no distinction between the systems the device is preparing . in operational terms , this is the judgment that _ all the systems are and will be the same as far as observational predictions are concerned_. at first glance this statement might seem to be contentless , but the important point is this : to make this statement , one need never use the notion of an unknown state  a completely operational description is good enough . putting it into technical terms",
    ", the statement is that if the experimenter judges a collection of @xmath1 of the device s outputs to have an overall quantum state @xmath2 , he will also judge any permutation of those outputs to have the same quantum state @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , he will do this no matter how large the number @xmath1 is .",
    "this , complemented only by the consistency condition that for any @xmath1 the state @xmath2 be derivable from @xmath3 , makes for the complete story .",
    "the words `` quantum state '' appear in this formulation , just as in the original formulation of tomography , but there is no longer any mention of _ unknown _ quantum states .",
    "the state @xmath2 is known by the experimenter ( if no one else ) , for it represents his state of knowledge .",
    "more importantly , the experimenter is in a position to make an unambiguous statement about the structure of the whole sequence of states @xmath2 : each of the states @xmath2 has a kind of permutation invariance over its factors .",
    "the content of the _ quantum de finetti representation theorem _",
    "@xcite  a new proof of which is the main technical result of this paper  is that a sequence of states @xmath2 can have these properties , which are said to make it an _ exchangeable _ sequence , if and only if each term in it can also be written in the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a fixed probability distribution over the density operators .",
    "the interpretive import of this theorem is paramount .",
    "it alone gives a mandate to the term unknown state in the usual description of tomography .",
    "it says that the experimenter can act _ as if _ his state of knowledge @xmath2 comes about because he knows there is a `` man in the box , '' hidden from view , repeatedly preparing the same state @xmath0 .",
    "he does not know which such state , and the best he can say about the unknown state is captured in the probability distribution @xmath6 .",
    "the quantum de finetti theorem furthermore makes a connection to the overarching theme of bayesianism stressed above .",
    "it guarantees for two independent observers  as long as they have a rather minimal agreement in their initial beliefs  that the outcomes of a sufficiently informative set of measurements will force a convergence in their state assignments for the remaining systems  @xcite .",
    "this `` minimal '' agreement is characterized by a judgment on the part of both parties that the sequence of systems is exchangeable , as described above , and a promise that the observers are not absolutely inflexible in their opinions .",
    "quantitatively , the latter means that though @xmath6 might be arbitrarily close to zero , it can never vanish .",
    "this coming to agreement works because an exchangeable density operator sequence can be updated to reflect information gathered from measurements by a quantum version of bayes s rule for updating probabilities .",
    "specifically , if measurements on @xmath7 systems yield results @xmath8 , then the state of additional systems is constructed as in eq .",
    "( [ jeremy ] ) , but using an updated probability on density operators given by @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the probability to obtain the measurement results @xmath8 , given the state @xmath11 for the @xmath7 measured systems , and @xmath12 is the unconditional probability for the measurement results .",
    "equation  ( [ qbayes ] ) is a kind of _ quantum bayes rule _ @xcite . for a sufficiently informative set of measurements ,",
    "as @xmath7 becomes large , the updated probability @xmath13 becomes highly peaked on a particular state @xmath14 dictated by the measurement results , regardless of the prior probability @xmath6 , as long as @xmath6 is nonzero in a neighborhood of @xmath14 .",
    "suppose the two observers have different initial beliefs , encapsulated in different priors @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the measurement results force them to a common state of knowledge in which any number @xmath1 of additional systems are assigned the product state @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 independent of @xmath19 , for @xmath7 sufficiently large .",
    "this shifts the perspective on the purpose of quantum - state tomography : it is not about uncovering some `` unknown state of nature , '' but rather about the various observers coming to agreement over future probabilistic predictions  @xcite . in this connection",
    ", it is interesting to note that the quantum de finetti theorem and the conclusions just drawn from it work only within the framework of complex vector - space quantum mechanics . for quantum mechanics based on real and quaternionic hilbert spaces  @xcite , the connection between exchangeable density operators and unknown quantum states does not hold .",
    "the plan of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - classical ] we discuss the classical de finetti representation theorem  @xcite in the context of bayesian probability theory .",
    "it was our familiarity with the classical theorem  @xcite that motivated our reconsideration of quantum - state tomography . in sec .",
    "[ sec - quantum ] we introduce the information - based formulation of tomography in terms of exchangeable multi - system density operators , accompanied by a critical discussion of objectivist formulations of tomography , and we state the quantum de finetti representation theorem .",
    "section  [ sec - proof ] presents an elementary proof of the quantum de finetti theorem .",
    "there , also , we introduce a novel measurement technique for tomography based upon generalized quantum measurements . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec - outlook ] we return to the issue of number fields in quantum mechanics and mention possible extensions of the main theorem .",
    "as a preliminary to the quantum problem , we turn our attention to classical probability theory . in doing",
    "so we follow a maxim of the late e.  t. jaynes  @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ we think it unlikely that the role of probability in quantum theory will be understood until it is generally understood in classical theory  . indeed ,",
    "our [ seventy - five - year - old ] bemusement over the notion of state reduction in [ quantum theory ] need not surprise us when we note that today , in all applications of probability theory , basically the same controversy rages over whether our probabilities represent real situations , or only incomplete human knowledge .",
    "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    as jaynes makes clear , the tension between the objectivist and informational points of view is not new with quantum mechanics .",
    "it arises already in classical probability theory in the form of the war between `` objective '' and `` subjective '' interpretations  @xcite .",
    "according to the subjective or bayesian interpretation , probabilities are measures of credible belief , reflecting an agent s potential states of knowledge . on the other hand , the objective interpretations  in all their varied forms , from frequency interpretations",
    "to propensity interpretations ",
    "attempt to view probabilities as real states of affairs or `` states of nature . ''",
    "following our discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec - intro ] , it will come as no surprise to the reader that the authors wholeheartedly adopt the bayesian approach . for us ,",
    "the ultimate reason is simply our own experience with this question , part of which is an appreciation that objective interpretations inevitably run into insurmountable difficulties .",
    "we will not dwell upon these difficulties here ; instead , the reader can find a sampling of criticisms in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will note briefly , however , that the game of roulette provides an illuminating example . in the european version of the game , the possible outcomes are the numbers @xmath20 . for a player without any privileged information ,",
    "all 37 outcomes have the same probability @xmath21 . but suppose that shortly after the ball is launched by the croupier , another player obtains information about the ball s position and velocity relative to the wheel . using the information obtained ,",
    "this other player can make more accurate predictions than the first  @xcite .",
    "his probability is peaked around some group of numbers .",
    "the probabilities are thus different for two players with different states of knowledge .",
    "whose probability is the true probability ?",
    "from the bayesian viewpoint , this question is meaningless : there is no such thing as a true probability .",
    "all probability assignments are subjective assignments based specifically upon one s prior information .    for sufficiently precise data  including precise initial data on positions and velocities and probably also including other details such as surface properties of the wheel ",
    "newtonian mechanics assures us that the outcome can be predicted with certainty .",
    "this is an important point : the determinism of classical physics provides a strong reason for adopting the subjectivist view of probabilities  @xcite . if the conditions of a trial are exactly specified , the outcomes are predictable with certainty , and all probabilities are 0 or 1 . in a deterministic theory ,",
    "all probabilities strictly greater than 0 and less than 1 arise as a consequence of incomplete information and depend upon their assigner s state of knowledge .    of course",
    ", we should keep in mind that our ultimate goal is to consider the status of quantum states and , by way of them , quantum probabilities .",
    "one can ask , `` does this not change the flavor of these considerations ? '' since quantum mechanics is avowedly _ not _ a theory of one s ignorance of a set of hidden variables  @xcite , how can the probabilities be subjective ? in sec .",
    "[ sec - quantum ] we argue that despite the intrinsic indeterminism of quantum mechanics , the essence of the point above carries over to the quantum setting intact .",
    "furthermore , there are specifically quantum - motivated arguments for a bayesian interpretation of quantum probabilities .    for the present ,",
    "though , let us consider in some detail the general problem of a repeated experiment  spinning a roulette wheel @xmath1 times is an example .",
    "as discussed briefly in sec .",
    "[ sec - intro ] , this allows us to make a conceptual connection to quantum - state tomography . here",
    "the individual trials are described by discrete random variables @xmath22 , @xmath23 ; that is to say , there are @xmath1 random variables , each of which can assume @xmath24 discrete values . in an objectivist theory ,",
    "such an experiment has a standard formulation in which the probability in the multi - trial hypothesis space is given by an independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "distribution @xmath25 the number @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) describes the objective , `` true '' probability that the result of a single experiment will be @xmath28 ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath29 , on the other hand , is the number of times outcome @xmath28 is listed in the vector @xmath30 .",
    "this simple description  for the objectivist  only describes the situation from a kind of `` god s eye '' point of view . to the experimentalist ,",
    "the `` true '' probabilities @xmath31 will very often be _ unknown _ at the outset .",
    "thus , his burden is to estimate the unknown probabilities by a statistical analysis of the experiment s outcomes .    in the bayesian approach",
    ", it does not make sense to talk about estimating a true probability .",
    "instead , a bayesian assigns a prior probability distribution @xmath32 on the multi - trial hypothesis space , which is generally not an i.i.d . , and then uses bayes s theorem to update the distribution in the light of measurement results .",
    "a common criticism from the objectivist camp is that the choice of distribution @xmath32 with which to start the process seems overly arbitrary to them . on what can it be grounded",
    ", they would ask ? from the bayesian viewpoint ,",
    "the subjectivity of the prior is a strength rather than a weakness , because assigning a prior amounts to laying bare the necessarily subjective assumptions behind _ any _ probabilistic argument , be it bayesian or objectivist . choosing a prior among all possible distributions on the multi - trial hypothesis space is , however , a daunting task .",
    "as we will now see , the de finetti representation theorem makes this task tractable .",
    "it is very often the case that one or more features of a problem stand out so clearly that there is no question about how to incorporate them into an initial assignment . in the present case ,",
    "the key feature is contained in the assumption that an arbitrary number of repeated trials are equivalent .",
    "this means that one has no reason to believe there will be a difference between one trial and the next . in this case , the prior distribution is judged to have the sort of permutation symmetry discussed briefly in sec .",
    "[ sec - intro ] , which de finetti @xcite called _",
    "exchangeability_. the rigorous definition of exchangeability proceeds in two stages .",
    "a probability distribution @xmath32 is said to be _ symmetric _ ( or finitely exchangeable ) if it is invariant under permutations of its arguments , i.e. , if @xmath33 for any permutation @xmath34 of the set @xmath35 .",
    "the distribution @xmath32 is called _ exchangeable _ ( or infinitely exchangeable ) if it is symmetric and if for any integer @xmath36 , there is a symmetric distribution @xmath37 such that @xmath38 this last statement means the distribution @xmath39 can be extended to a symmetric distribution of arbitrarily many random variables",
    ". expressed informally , an exchangeable distribution can be thought of as arising from an infinite sequence of random variables whose order is irrelevant .",
    "we now come to the main statement of this section : if a probability distribution @xmath32 is exchangeable , then it can be written uniquely in the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and the integral is taken over the probability simplex @xmath42 furthermore , the function @xmath43 is required to be a probability density function on the simplex : @xmath44 equation  ( [ eq - repr ] ) comprises the classical de finetti representation theorem for discrete random variables . for completeness and",
    "because it deserves to be more widely familiar in the physics community , we give a simple proof ( due to heath and sudderth @xcite ) of the representation theorem for the binary random - variable case in an appendix .",
    "let us reiterate the importance of this result for the present considerations .",
    "it says that an agent , making solely the judgment of exchangeability for a sequence of random variables @xmath45 , can proceed _ as if _ his state of knowledge had instead come about through ignorance of an _ unknown _ , but objectively existent set of probabilities @xmath46 .",
    "his precise ignorance of @xmath46 is captured by the `` probability on probabilities '' @xmath47 .",
    "this is in direct analogy to what we desire of a solution to the problem of the unknown quantum state in quantum - state tomography .    as a final note before finally addressing the quantum problem in sec .",
    "[ sec - quantum ] , we point out that both conditions in the definition of exchangeability are crucial for the proof of the de finetti theorem .",
    "in particular , there are probability distributions @xmath32 that are symmetric , but not exchangeable .",
    "a simple example is the distribution @xmath48 of two binary random variables @xmath49 , @xmath50 one can easily check that @xmath48 can not be written as the marginal of a symmetric distribution of three variables , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq - marginal ] ) .",
    "therefore it can have no representation along the lines of eq .",
    "( [ eq - repr ] ) .",
    "( for an extended discussion of this , see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) indeed , eqs .",
    "( [ hocuspocus ] ) and ( [ hiroshima ] ) characterize a perfect `` anticorrelation '' of the two variables , in contrast to the positive correlation implied by distributions of de finetti form .",
    "the content of this point is that both conditions in the definition of exchangeability ( symmetry under interchange and infinite extendibility ) are required to ensure , in colloquial terms , `` that the future will appear much as the past '' @xcite , rather than , say , the opposite of the past .",
    "let us now return to the problem of quantum - state tomography described in sec .",
    "[ sec - intro ] . in the objectivist formulation of the problem",
    ", a device repeatedly prepares copies of a system in the same quantum state @xmath0 .",
    "this is generally a mixed - state density operator on a hilbert space @xmath51 of @xmath52 dimensions .",
    "we call the totality of such density operators @xmath53 . the joint quantum state of the @xmath1 systems prepared by the device is then given by @xmath54 the @xmath1-fold tensor product of @xmath0 with itself .",
    "this , of course , is a very restricted example of a density operator on the tensor - product hilbert space @xmath55 .",
    "the experimenter , who performs quantum - state tomography , tries to determine @xmath0 as precisely as possible .",
    "depending upon the version of the argument , @xmath0 is interpreted as the `` true '' state of each of the systems or as a description of the `` true '' preparation procedure .",
    "we have already articulated our dissatisfaction with this way of stating the problem , but we give here a further sense of why both interpretations above are untenable .",
    "let us deal first with the version where @xmath0 is regarded as the true , objective state of each of the systems . in this discussion",
    "it is useful to consider separately the cases of mixed and pure states @xmath0 . the arguments against regarding mixed states as objective properties of a quantum system are essentially the same as those against regarding probabilities as objective .",
    "in analogy to the roulette example given in the previous section , we can say that , whenever an observer assigns a mixed state to a physical system , one can think of another observer who assigns a different state based on privileged information .",
    "the quantum argument becomes yet more compelling if the apparently nonlocal nature of quantum states is taken into consideration .",
    "consider two parties , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , who are far apart in space , say several light years apart .",
    "each party possesses a spin-@xmath58 particle .",
    "initially the joint state of the two particles is the maximally entangled pure state @xmath59 .",
    "consequently , @xmath56 assigns the totally mixed state @xmath60 to her own particle .",
    "now @xmath57 makes a measurement on his particle , finds the result 0 , and assigns to @xmath56 s particle the pure state @xmath61 .",
    "is this now the `` true , '' objective state of @xmath56 s particle ? at what precise time does the objective state of @xmath56 s particle change from totally mixed to pure ? if the answer is `` simultaneously with @xmath57 s measurement , '' then what frame of reference should be used to determine simultaneity ?",
    "these questions and potential paradoxes are avoided if states are interpreted as states of knowledge . in our example , @xmath56 and @xmath57 have different states of knowledge and therefore assign different states . for a detailed analysis of this example ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite ; for an experimental investigation see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "if one admits that mixed states can not be objective properties , because another observer , possessing privileged information , can know which pure state underlies the mixed state , then it becomes very tempting to regard the pure states as giving the `` true '' state of a system .",
    "probabilities that come from pure states would then be regarded as objective , and the probabilities for pure states within an ensemble decomposition of a mixed state would be regarded as subjective , expressing our ignorance of which pure state is the `` true '' state of the system .",
    "an immediate and , in our view , irremediable problem with this idea is that a mixed state has infinitely many ensemble decompositions into pure states @xcite , so the distinction between subjective and objective becomes hopelessly blurred .",
    "this problem can be made concrete by the example of a spin-@xmath62 particle .",
    "any pure state of the particle can be written in terms of the pauli matrices , @xmath63 as @xmath64 where the unit vector @xmath65 labels the pure state , and @xmath66 denotes the unit operator .",

    "the lesson is that if a density operator is even partially a reflection of one s state of knowledge , the multiplicity of ensemble decomposition means that a pure state must also be a state of knowledge .",

    "imagine that the tomographic reconstruction results in the mixed state @xmath0 , rather than a pure state , as in fact all actual laboratory procedures do . now there is a serious problem , because a mixed state does not correspond to a well - defined procedure , but is itself a probabilistic mixture of well - defined procedures , i.e. , pure states .",
    "the experimenter is thus trying to determine an unknown procedure that has no unique decomposition into well defined procedures .",

    "the upshot of the theorem , as already advertised , is that it makes it possible to think of an exchangeable quantum - state assignment _ as if _ it were a probabilistic mixture characterized by a probability density @xmath6 for the product states @xmath107 .",
    "just as in the classical case , both components of the definition of exchangeability are crucial for arriving at the representation theorem of eq .",
    "( [ eq - qdefinetti ] ) .",
    "the reason now , however , is much more interesting than it was previously . in the classical case ,",
    "extendibility was used solely to exclude anticorrelated probability distributions . here",
    "extendibility is necessary to exclude the possibility of bell inequality violations for measurements on the separate systems .",
    "this is because the assumption of symmetry alone for an @xmath1-party quantum system does not exclude the possibility of quantum entanglement , and all states that can be written as a mixture of product states  of which eq .",
    "( [ eq - qdefinetti ] ) is an example  have no entanglement  @xcite .",
    "a very simple counterexample is the greenberger - horne - zeilinger state of three spin-@xmath69 particles  @xcite , @xmath108 , where @xmath0 is the state of the fourth particle ; such states clearly can not be symmetric .",
    "these considerations show that in order for the proposed theorem to be valid , it must be the case that as @xmath100 increases in eq .",
    "( [ hounddog ] ) , the possibilities for entanglement in the separate systems compensatingly decrease  @xcite .",
    "to prove the quantum version of the de finetti theorem , we rely on the classical theorem as much as possible . we start from an exchangeable density operator @xmath2 defined on @xmath1 copies of a system .",
    "we bring the classical theorem to our aid by imagining a sequence of identical quantum measurements on the separate systems and considering the outcome probabilities they would produce . because @xmath2 is assumed exchangeable , such identical measurements give rise to an exchangeable probability distribution for the outcomes .",
    "the trick is to recover enough information from the exchangeable statistics of these measurements to characterize the exchangeable density operators .",
    "with this in mind , the proof is expedited by making use of the theory of generalized quantum measurements or positive operator - valued measures ( povms )  @xcite .",
    "we give a brief introduction to that theory . the common textbook notion of a measurement  that is",
    ", a von neumann measurement  is that any laboratory procedure counting as an observation can be identified with a hermitian operator @xmath109 on the hilbert space @xmath51 of the system . depending upon the presentation ,",
    "the measurement outcomes are identified either with the eigenvalues @xmath110 or with a complete set of normalized eigenvectors @xmath111 for @xmath109 .",
    "when the quantum state is @xmath0 , the probabilities for the various outcomes are computed from the eigenprojectors @xmath112 via the standard born rule , @xmath113 this rule gives a consistent probability assignment because the eigenprojectors @xmath114 are positive - semidefinite operators , which makes the @xmath115 nonnegative , and because the projectors form a resolution of the identity operator @xmath66 , @xmath116 which guarantees that @xmath117 .",
    "povms generalize the textbook notion of measurement by distilling the essential properties that make the born rule work .",
    "the generalized notion of measurement is this : _ any _ set @xmath118 of positive - semidefinite operators on @xmath119 that forms a resolution of the identity , i.e. , that satisfies @xmath120 and @xmath121 corresponds to at least one laboratory procedure counting as a measurement .",
    "the outcomes of the measurement are identified with the indices @xmath122 , and the probabilities of those outcomes are computed according to the generalized born rule , @xmath123 the set @xmath124 is called a povm , and the operators @xmath125 are called povm elements . unlike von neumann measurements ,",
    "there is no limitation on the number of values @xmath122 can take , the operators @xmath125 need not be rank-1 , and there is no requirement that the @xmath125 be mutually orthogonal .",
    "this definition has important content because the older notion of measurement is simply too restrictive : there are laboratory procedures that clearly should be called `` measurements , '' but that can not be expressed in terms of the von neumann measurement process alone .",
    "one might wonder whether the existence of povms contradicts everything taught about standard measurements in the traditional graduate textbooks  @xcite and the well - known classics  @xcite .",
    "fortunately it does not .",
    "the reason is that any povm can be represented formally as a standard measurement on an ancillary system that has interacted in the past with the system of main interest .",
    "thus , in a certain sense , von neumann measurements capture everything that can be said about quantum measurements @xcite .",
    "a way to think about this is that by learning something about the ancillary system through a standard measurement , one in turn learns something about the system of real interest .",
    "indirect though this might seem , it can be a very powerful technique , sometimes revealing information that could not have been revealed otherwise  @xcite .    for instance , by considering povms , one can consider measurements with an outcome cardinality that exceeds the dimensionality of the hilbert space .",
    "what this means is that whereas the statistics of a von neumann measurement can only reveal information about the @xmath52 diagonal elements of a density operator @xmath0 , through the probabilities @xmath126 , the statistics of a povm generally can reveal things about the off - diagonal elements , too .",
    "it is precisely this property that we take advantage of in our proof of the quantum de finetti theorem .",
    "our problem hinges on finding a special kind of povm , one for which any set of outcome probabilities specifies a unique operator .",
    "this boils down to a problem in pure linear algebra .",
    "the space of operators on @xmath51 is itself a linear vector space of dimension @xmath127 .",

    "two distinct density operators @xmath0 and @xmath130 must give rise to different measurement statistics .",
    "such measurements , which might be called _ informationally complete _ , have been studied for some time  @xcite .    for our proof",
    "we need a slightly refined notion  that of a _ minimal _ informationally complete measurement .",
    "if an informationally complete povm has more than @xmath127 operators @xmath125 , these operators form an overcomplete set .",
    "this means that given a set of outcome probabilities @xmath131 , there is generally _ no _ operator @xmath56 that generates them according to @xmath132 .",
    "our proof requires the existence of such an operator , so we need a povm that has precisely @xmath127 linearly independent povm elements @xmath125 .",
    "such a povm has the minimal number of povm elements to be informationally complete .",
    "given a set of outcome probabilities @xmath131 , there is a unique operator @xmath56 such that @xmath132 , even though , as we discuss below , @xmath56 is not guaranteed to be a density operator .",
    "do minimal informationally complete povms exist ?",
    "the answer is yes .",
    "we give here a simple way to produce one , though there are surely more elegant ways with greater symmetry .",
    "start with a complete orthonormal basis @xmath133 on @xmath51 , and let @xmath134 .",

    "hence the de finetti representation theorem does not hold in real - hilbert - space quantum mechanics .",
    "similar considerations show that in quaternionic quantum mechanics ( a theory again precisely the same as ordinary quantum mechanics except that it uses hilbert spaces over the quaternionic field  @xcite ) , the connection between exchangeable density operators and decompositions of the de finetti form  ( [ eq - qdefinetti ] ) breaks down .",
    "the failure mode is , however , even more disturbing than for real hilbert spaces . in quaternionic quantum mechanics , most operators of the de finetti form  ( [ eq - qdefinetti ] )",
    "do not correspond to valid quaternionic quantum states , even though the states @xmath0 in the integral are valid quaternionic states .",
    "the reason is that tensor products of quaternionic hermitian operators are not necessarily hermitian .    in classical probability theory",
    ", exchangeability characterizes those situations where the only data relevant for updating a probability distribution are frequency data , i.e. , the numbers @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ eq - repr ] ) which tell how often the result @xmath28 occurred .",
    "the quantum de finetti representation shows that the same is true in quantum mechanics : frequency data ( with respect to a sufficiently robust measurement ) are sufficient for updating an exchangeable state to the point where nothing more can be learned from sequential measurements ; that is , one obtains a convergence of the form  ( [ hanniballecter ] ) , so that ultimately any further measurements on the individual systems are statistically independent . that there is no quantum de finetti theorem in real hilbert space means that there are fundamental differences between real and complex hilbert spaces with respect to learning from measurement results .",
    "the ultimate reason for this is that in ordinary , complex - hilbert - space quantum mechanics , exchangeability implies separability , i.e. , the absence of entanglement .",
    "this follows directly from the quantum de finetti theorem , because states of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq - qdefinetti ] ) are not entangled .",
    "this implication does not carry over to real hilbert spaces . by the same reasoning used to show that the de finetti theorem itself fails , the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq - real ] ) can not be written as _",
    "any _ mixture of real product states . interpreted as a state in real hilbert space , the state in eq .",
    "( [ eq - real ] ) is thus not separable , but entangled  @xcite . in a real hilbert space ,",
    "exchangeable states can be entangled and local measurements can not reveal that .    beyond these conceptual points , we also believe that the technical methods exhibited here might be of interest in the practical arena .",
    "recently there has been a large literature on which classes of measurements have various advantages for tomographic purposes  @xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", the present work is the only one to consider tomographic reconstruction based upon minimal informationally complete povms .",
    "one can imagine several advantages to this approach via the fact that such povms with rank - one elements are automatically extreme points in the convex set of all measurements  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the classical de finetti theorem is only the tip of an iceberg with respect to general questions in statistics to do with exchangeability and various generalizations of the concept  @xcite .",
    "one should expect no less of quantum exchangeability studies .",
    "in particular here , we are thinking of things like the question of representation theorems for finitely exchangeable distributions  @xcite . just as our method for proving the quantum de finetti theorem was able to rely heavily on the the classical theorem , so one might expect similar benefits from the classical results in the case of quantum finite exchangeability ",
    "although there will certainly be new aspects to the quantum case due to the possibility of entanglement in finite exchangeable states .",
    "a practical application of such representation theorems could be their potential to contribute to the solution of some outstanding problems in constructing security proofs for various quantum key distribution schemes  @xcite .",
    "in general , our effort in the present paper forms part of a larger program to promote a consistent information - based interpretation of quantum mechanics and to delineate its consequences .",
    "we find it encouraging that the fruits of this effort may not be restricted solely to an improved understanding of quantum mechanics , but also possess the potential to contribute to practical applications .",
    "we thank ben schumacher for discussions .",

    "in this appendix we reprise the admirably simple proof of the classical de finetti representation theorem given by heath and sudderth @xcite for the case of binary variables .",
    "suppose we have an exchangeable probability assignment for @xmath100 binary random variables , @xmath223 , taking on the values 0 and 1 .",
    "let @xmath224 , @xmath225 , be the probability for @xmath226 1s in @xmath1 trials .",
    "exchangeability guarantees that @xmath227 we can condition the probability on the right on the occurrence of @xmath228 1s in all @xmath100 trials : @xmath229 given @xmath228 1s in @xmath100 trials , exchangeability guarantees that the @xmath230 sequences are equally likely .",
    "thus the situation is identical to drawing from an urn with @xmath228 1s on @xmath100 balls , and we have that @xmath231 where @xmath232 the result is that @xmath233    what remains is to take the limit @xmath234 , which we can do because of the extendibility property of exchangeable probabilities .",
    "we can write @xmath224 as an integral @xmath235 where @xmath236 is a distribution concentrated at the @xmath100-trial frequencies @xmath237 . in the limit @xmath234",
    ", @xmath238 converges to a continuous distribution @xmath239 , and the other terms in the integrand go to @xmath240 , giving @xmath241 we have demonstrated the classical de finetti representation theorem for binary variables : if @xmath224 is part of an infinite exchangeable sequence , then it has a de finetti representation in terms of a `` probability on probabilities '' @xmath239 .",

    "the existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector by the schrdinger equation on the one hand and by the process of measurement ( sometimes described as the `` reduction of the wave packet '' ) on the other , is a classic subject for discussion in the quantum theory of measurement .",

    "the `` reduction of the wave packet '' does take place in the consciousness of the observer , not because of any unique physical process which takes place there , but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system .",

    "<S> the classical de finetti theorem provides an operational definition of the concept of an unknown probability in bayesian probability theory , where probabilities are taken to be degrees of belief instead of objective states of nature . the quantum de finetti theorem , in a closely analogous fashion , deals with exchangeable density - operator assignments and provides an operational definition of the concept of an `` unknown quantum state '' in quantum - state tomography . </S>",
    "<S> this result is especially important for information - based interpretations of quantum mechanics , where quantum states , like probabilities , are taken to be states of knowledge rather than states of nature . </S>",
