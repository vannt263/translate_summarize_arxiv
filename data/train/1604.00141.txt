    "<S> the conventional slow - roll approximation is broken in the so - called `` ultra slow - roll '' models of inflation , for which the inflaton potential is exactly ( or extremely ) flat . </S>",
    "<S> the interesting nature of ( canonical ) ultra slow - roll inflation is that the curvature perturbation grows on superhorizon scales , but has a scale - invariant power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we study the ultra slow - roll inflationary dynamics in the presence of noncanonical kinetic terms of the scalar field , namely ultra slow - roll g - inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we compute the evolution of the curvature perturbation and show that the primordial power spectrum follows a broken power law with an oscillation feature . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that this could explain the lack of large - scale power in the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies . </S>",
    "<S> we also point out that the violation of the null energy condition is prohibited in ultra slow - roll g - inflation and hence a blue tensor tilt is impossible as long as inflation is driven by the potential . </S>",
    "<S> this statement is , however , not true if the energy density is dominated by the kinetic energy of the scalar field . </S>"
