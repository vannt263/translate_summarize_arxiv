    "the central @xmath1 pc of the galaxy host a phenomenon that is unique within the galaxy : narrow , `` vertical '' ( i.e. @xmath0 to the galactic plane ) filaments of radio emission that are typically a few tens of parsecs long and only a fraction of a parsec wide ( morris 1996 ) .",
    "polarization measurements indicate that the magnetic fields in the radio arc and northern thread are parallel to these filaments ( tsuboi et  al .",
    "1986 , reich 1994 , tsuboi et  al .",
    "1995 , lang et  al .",
    "1999b ) , and this alignment is presumed to be typical of the other filaments as well .",
    "in virtually all cases the filaments appear to be in contact with a molecular cloud at some point along their length . the absence of bending of these filaments by the randomly moving clouds has been interpreted as evidence of a milligauss lower limit to the field strength in the filaments ( yusef - zadeh & morris 1987a  this point is discussed further in section [ sec : review ] ) . the apparent impossibility of forming or confining narrow filaments with such tremendous magnetic pressures ",
    "well in excess of the thermal pressure of the medium  suggests that if a mg vertical field is present , it pervades the central @xmath1 pc of the galaxy , and the filaments are simply those flux tubes that possess large populations of relativistic electrons ( morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "a strong pervasive magnetic field at the galactic center would be a natural consequence of radial inflow in the galactic disk ( sofue & fujimoto 1987 , morris & serabyn 1996 ) , and magnetic - pressure forces would over time cause the volume - filling magnetic flux tubes to rise buoyantly away from the galactic mid - plane , forcing field lines that penetrate the mid - plane into a vertical orientation ( chandran et  al .",
    "it is not clear , however , that such a scenario is inevitable , as the rate of radial inflow in the galactic disk is not well known and since sufficient turbulent resistivity can inhibit the central concentration of the field ( lubow , papaloizou , & pringle 1994 ) .",
    "alternative explanations of the filaments have been explored by a number of authors ( chudnovsky et  al .",
    "1986 , benford 1988 , heyvaerts , norman , & pudritz 1988 , lesch & reich 1992 , rosso & pelletier 1993 , shore & larosa 1999 ) .",
    "if a pervasive mg field is present , it would play a dominant role in the dynamics of the interstellar medium near the galactic center , and would suggest that the galaxy was born with a magnetic field @xmath24  g ( chandran et  al 2000this point is discussed further in section  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "one of the most pressing questions regarding the pervasive - mg - field hypothesis is whether such a strong magnetic field could be stably confined .",
    "the volume - dominant phase of the central region is hot plasma at a temperature @xmath25  k which fills an elliptical region @xmath26 pc ( fwhm ) with a major axis that is tilted @xmath27 with respect to the galactic plane ( yamauchi et  al .",
    "the density of this plasma was estimated to be @xmath28 by yamauchi et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) and @xmath29 by koyama et  al .",
    "the mass - dominant phase of the central region is molecular gas with @xmath30 , @xmath31  k , a filling factor in excess of 0.1 , and a vertical thickness of @xmath32 pc ( bally et  al .  1988 ,",
    "morris & serabyn 1996 ) . if the magnetic field strength is 1  mg , then the magnetic pressure @xmath33 is @xmath34 , which far exceeds the thermal pressure of both the hot plasma , @xmath35 , and the molecular material , @xmath36 .",
    "the thermal pressure of the ambient medium is thus unable to confine mg fields , whether they are ubiquitous or in the form of isolated narrow flux tubes .",
    "the only force capable of confining a pervasive vertical mg field is the weight of the molecular material .",
    "interestingly , the polarization of dust emission indicates that the molecular material is threaded by horizontal ( i.e. , @xmath2 to the galactic plane ) magnetic fields ( morris & serabyn 1996 ) . because this horizontal field is perpendicular to the vertical magnetic field in the hot plasma , it is difficult for the two types of material to interpenetrate , which suggests that the weight of the molecular material may be able to stably prevent a strong vertical field from expanding .",
    "although the molecular clouds are clumpy , it is expected that the horizontal magnetic field completely encloses the central region . in this paper , the equilibrium of figure  [ fig : equil ] is proposed as a starting point for investigating the confinement of vertical fields at the galactic center .    to make a compact analytic treatment possible",
    ", the stability of this equilibrium is explored under a number of additional simplifying approximations .",
    "it is assumed that the fractional ionization within the molecular clouds is sufficiently large and the frequencies of any instabilities sufficiently small compared to the neutral - ion collision frequency that ambipolar diffusion can be ignored .",
    "the partially ionized clouds then behave as a single - species fluid to which the magnetic field is frozen , or , in other words , as a dense plasma described by the equations of magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "the equilibrium is taken to be infinite and invariant along the spin axis ",
    "the @xmath3 axis in cylindrical coordinates @xmath4 as depicted in figure  [ fig : equil_picture ] .",
    "a constant angular velocity @xmath21 is assumed , which removes the magneto - rotational instability from the problem ( balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "an axial magnetic field and low - density plasma are assumed for @xmath5 pc , and an azimuthal magnetic field and dense plasma for @xmath37 pc .",
    "the equilibrium density @xmath38 , pressure @xmath39 , and field strength @xmath40 are assumed to be proportional to powers of  @xmath41 within the dense plasma , and @xmath42 is taken to be constant and small , which implies that the sound speed  @xmath22 and alfvn speed  @xmath43 are proportional to  @xmath41 .",
    "the gravitational acceleration  @xmath44 is taken to be proportional to  @xmath41 and to be directed in the  @xmath45 direction .",
    "if @xmath44 arises from stars , this amounts to assuming a constant mass density of stars throughout the region occupied by the plasma .",
    "it is also assumed that the plasma is supported primarily by rotation , so that @xmath46 in the dense plasma , where @xmath47 . although some of these assumptions are extreme , a number of the key ingredients are retained : compressibility , the coriolis force , the suspension of dense plasma `` above '' low - density plasma , and the orthogonal orientations of the magnetic fields in the low- and high - density plasmas .",
    "the analysis then focuses on modes which perturb the sharp boundary between the high- and low - density plasmas .",
    "such perturbations are to some extent stabilized by magnetic tension , since short - wavelength disturbances involve significant field - line bending of either the axial or azimuthal magnetic fields .",
    "uniform rotation also plays a stabilizing role ( e.g. , talwar 1960 , chandrasekhar 1961 , gilman 1970 , acheson & gibbons 1978 ) .",
    "normal modes of the form @xmath48 with @xmath18 and @xmath15 are studied analtyically .",
    "such modes avoid bending or compressing the axial magnetic field at @xmath49 pc and also allow compressions of the dense plasma along the azimuthal magnetic field that enhance the destabilizing effects of gravity .",
    "it is shown in sections  [ sec : diffeq ] through  [ sec : bc ] that the necessary and sufficient condition for stability to @xmath18 modes is @xmath50 when @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the effective gravity , and @xmath22 and @xmath43 are evaluated in the dense plasma . a physical explanation of equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit0 ] ) is given in section  [ sec : stability ] . since the effective gravity is proportional to the partial support of the plasma by the magnetic field , equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit0 ] ) can be re - written as an upper limit on the strength of the vertical field [ equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit3 ] ) ] . for galactic - center parameters , the upper limit is @xmath53  mg .",
    "if equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit0 ] ) is the approximate criterion for the stability of the boundary between the high and low - density plasmas in systems with differential rotation , a finite extent along the @xmath3 axis , and more general radial profiles  say by evaluating the terms in equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit0 ] ) near the inner edge of the dense plasma  then a pervasive mg vertical magnetic field can be confined at the galactic center .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit0 ] ) would then also be relevant to other accreting systems with strong poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "global instabilities with @xmath54 , local quasi - interchange modes , and instabilities of the two - dimensional plasma of figure  [ fig : equil ] are discussed in section  [ sec : local ] . in section  [ sec : review ] , observational constraints on the field - strength in the galactic - center filaments are reviewed .",

    "how this instability mechanism affects the stability criterion of the rotating equilibrium of figure  [ fig : equil_picture ] is left for future work .",
    "newcomb ( 1961 ) showed that the convective stability criterion for a compressible stratified magnetized slab when @xmath389 is less stringent than the stability criterion in the limit @xmath390 , where @xmath391 is the component of the wave vector along the magnetic field .",
    "this is because when @xmath392 , newcomb s type  2 modes , which involve motion primarily along the magnetic field , become pure translations which are neutrally stable ( @xmath393 ) .",
    "the @xmath394 stability criterion is thus the one that applies to newcomb s type  1 modes , which involve motion primarily across field lines",
    ". on the other hand , when @xmath395 is small but nonzero , the type  2 modes allow destabilizing compressions of the plasma along the magnetic field and can be unstable even when type  1 modes are stable .",
    "the distinction between @xmath394 and @xmath396 in newcomb s work is not directly analogous to the distinction between @xmath397 and @xmath398 in the equilibrium of figure  [ fig : equil_picture ] , in that @xmath391 corresponds to @xmath60 since it is the dense plasma that dominates the dynamics of the unstable modes .",
    "the two - dimensional equilibrium of figure  [ fig : equil ] is subject to instabilities not present in the one - dimensional infinite - cylinder equilibrium .",
    "if the vertical ( along @xmath3 ) stratification does not satisfy the schwarzchild criterion for a static non - magnetized gas , then the plasma is unstable to local non - axisymmetric quasi - interchange modes with @xmath399 and @xmath400 ( terquem & papaloizou 1996 ) .",
    "the displacements in such modes are essentially parallel to the spin axis , and thus the coriolis force vanishes , preventing the type of rotational stabilization that occurs for quasi - interchange modes in the one - dimensional infinite - cylinder equilibrium .",
    "if there is differential rotation with @xmath401 , the plasma is subject to the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) ( ogilvie & pringle 1996 , terquem & papaloizou 1996 , balbus & hawley 1998 ) .",
    "global three - dimensional numerical simulations suggest that turbulence excited by the mri will be present quite generally in astrophysical disks ( hawley , balbus , & stone 2001 ) .",
    "it is thus interesting to ask how the stability of the sharp boundary in figure  [ fig : equil ] is affected by differential rotation in a quiescent equilibrium flow as well as by differential rotation with turbulence .",
    "these questions are left for future work .",
    "lang et  al .  ( 1999b ) found that if the magnetic energy density in the northern thread is equal to the relativistic - particle energy density , and if the relativistic protons and electrons have equal energies , then the field strength is @xmath402 g .",
    "comparable equipartition field strengths have been found for the radio arc ( tsuboi et  al.1986 , yusef - zadeh & morris 1987b , reich 1994 ) .",
    "however , the equipartition estimate may lead to an underestimate of the field strength , particularly since the geometry of the filaments allows relativistic particles to stream directly out of the galactic - center region .",
    "all of the radio filaments that have been studied in detail near the galactic center appear to be interacting with at least one randomly moving molecular cloud , and yet most are undeformed at the sites of interaction ( morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "if the magnetic field were dynamically insignificant , one would expect the turbulent motions of the clouds to cause turbulent bulk motions in the hot plasma that would deform the frozen - in magnetic field lines .",
    "the lack of deformation gives a lower limit on the field strength in the filaments that depends upon how many independently moving clouds ( or clumps within a cloud ) interact with a single filament .",
    "if a vertical filament interacts with a single molecular cloud at a single point along its length , then the lower limit on its field strength is fairly small . since the vertical field @xmath87 threads the very tenuous hot plasma",
    ", there is very little mass to anchor the ends of the vertical field line above and below the galactic disk .",
    "any deformation in the field line in the galactic plane by an interaction with a molecular cloud is carried away along the field line at the alfvn speed of the hot medium , @xmath403 . in order for the visible deformations in the filaments to be small",
    ", the alfvn speed in the hot medium must be much larger than the turbulent speed of the the clouds @xmath404 with respect to the ends of the filament .",
    "the angle at which a field line is bent will be @xmath405 , as depicted in figure  [ fig : deformation ] . the condition @xmath406 can be written @xmath407 where @xmath408 is the number density of the hot plasma in @xmath409 . if @xmath410 km / s , and @xmath411 , then @xmath412 g .",
    "as pointed out by yusef - zadeh & morris ( 1987a ) and morris & serabyn ( 1996 ) , if a filament interacts with clouds at more than one point along its length , as happens in the radio arc ( morris 2001 ) , then the lower limit on the field strength may be considerably greater than in equation  ( [ eq : b1 ] ) . for certain cloud shapes",
    ", a filament could conceivably avoid the appearance of deformation by rapidly slipping around the moving clouds .",
    "for some cloud shapes , however , this would not be possible , and to avoid deformation a filament would have to dynamically oppose the force applied by the clouds . if this requires that the magnetic pressure in the filament exceed the ram pressure in the clouds , then @xmath413 mg ( yusef - zadeh & morris 1987a ) .",
    "if a single cloud consists of independently moving clumps , then a similar argument would apply to a filament interacting with a single cloud ( morris & serabyn 1996 ) .",
    "because of the simplifying assumptions made in this paper , further work is needed to determine the extent to which the stability criterion given by equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit ] ) applies to more realistic equilibria , and to extend the analysis to modes with @xmath414 .",
    "if equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit ] ) does describe , even approximately , the stability of the boundary between the high and low - density plasmas in systems with differential rotation , a finite extent along the @xmath3 axis , and more general radial profiles  say by evaluating the terms in equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit ] ) near the inner edge of the dense plasma  then it appears that a pervasive mg vertical magnetic field can be confined at the galactic center .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : stabcrit ] ) would then also be relevant to other accreting systems with strong central poloidal magnetic fields .",
    "a pervasive mg vertical magnetic field in the inner 150 pc of the galaxy would have important implications for the origin of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "if the vertical field originated from radial inflow over the lifetime of the galaxy , then the strength of the average vertical magnetic field in the galactic disk at the time of galaxy formation , @xmath415 , can be estimated by magnetic - flux conservation . if the average mass accretion rate into the galactic - center region is 0.3 @xmath416/yr ( morris & serabyn 1996 ) , and if the surface density of gas in the disk has remained constant over the lifetime of the galaxy , then all the gas that was within roughly 10 kpc of the galactic center at the time of galaxy formation has been accreted into the galactic - center region . if the magnetic field was frozen in to the interstellar plasma , then the vertical magnetic flux that initially threaded the central 10 kpc of the disk , @xmath417 , is now concentrated near the galactic center .",
    "if there is a pervasive vertical magnetic field at the galactic center today , it is unlikely that it contains regions of oppositely directed vertical fields , since the parallel geometry of field lines would permit rapid destruction of the oppositely directed fields by turbulent diffusion and reconnection . the current magnetic flux through the galactic - center region corresponding to such a pervasive field , @xmath418 ,",
    "can thus be estimated by multiplying field strength times area . if there is a mg vertical field throughout the central 150 pc of the galaxy , then @xmath419 .",
    "setting @xmath420 yields @xmath421  g ( chandran et  al 2000 ) , which would be consistent with a turbulent dynamo operating in the protogalaxy ( kulsrud et  al .  1997 ) .",
    "in this case , the boundary conditions are that the lagrangian total - pressure perturbation vanishes at @xmath149 and that the behavior as @xmath423 is such that the kinetic energy of the mode is finite . as in section",

    "<S> observations of narrow radio - emitting filaments near the galactic center have been interpreted in previous studies as evidence of a pervasive vertical ( i.e. @xmath0 to the galactic plane ) milligauss magnetic field in the central @xmath1 pc of the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> a simple cylindrically symmetric model for the equilibrium in this central region is proposed in which horizontal ( i.e. @xmath2 to the galactic plane ) magnetic fields embedded in an annular band of partially ionized molecular material of radius @xmath1 pc are wrapped around vertical magnetic fields threading low - density hot plasma . the central vertical magnetic field , which has a pressure that significantly exceeds the thermal pressure of the medium , is confined by the weight of the molecular material . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of this equilibrium is studied indirectly by analyzing a uniformly rotating cylinder of infinite extent along the @xmath3 axis in cylindrical coordinates @xmath4 , with low - density plasma and an axial magnetic field at @xmath5 pc , high - density plasma and an azimuthal field at @xmath6 pc , and a gravitational acceleration @xmath7 directed in the @xmath8 direction . </S>",
    "<S> simple profiles are assumed for the density @xmath9 , pressure @xmath10 , and field strength @xmath11 , with the sound speed and alfvn speeds @xmath12 within the dense plasma . </S>",
    "<S> the density profile and gravity tend to destabilize the plasma , but the plasma tends to be stabilized by rotation and magnetic tension  since the interface between the high and low - density plasmas can not be perturbed without bending either the horizontal or vertical field . </S>",
    "<S> normal modes proportional to @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 are studied . </S>",
    "<S> such modes neither bend nor compress the axial field at @xmath16 pc but allow compressions of the dense plasma along the azimuthal magnetic field that enhance the destabilizing role of gravity . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown analytically that when @xmath17 is small and the dense plasma is supported against gravity primarily by rotation , the necessary and sufficient condition for stability to @xmath18 modes is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the effective gravity , @xmath21 is the uniform angular velocity , and @xmath22 is the sound speed in the dense plasma . since the effective gravity is determined by the degree to which magnetic ( and to a lesser degree pressure ) forces support the dense plasma , the stability criterion gives an upper limit on the strength of the axial magnetic field , which is @xmath23 mg for galactic - center parameters . </S>"
