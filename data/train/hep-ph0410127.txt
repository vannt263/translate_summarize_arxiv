    "the most fundamental way to compute properties of strongly interacting matter and , in particular , its equation of state ( eos ) is provided by lattice qcd calculations @xcite . the technique of these calculations rapidly progresses .",
    "recently , lattice data on the eos at finite baryon chemical potential became available @xcite .",
    "interpretation of these data within the _ straightforward _ qcd perturbation theory @xcite is hardly possible in view of its extremely poor convergence for any temperature of practical interest . to overcome this poor convergence ,",
    "resummation schemes were developed .",
    "a scheme based on hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) effective action @xcite have been proposed , with alternative formulations in the form of so - called htl perturbation theory @xcite or based on the @xmath0-derivable approximation @xcite .",
    "this approach justified a picture of weakly interacting quasiparticles , as determined by the htl propagators , and resulted in remarkably good agreement with lattice data above @xmath1 , with @xmath2 being the critical temperature of the phase transition .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this quasiparicle picture emerges directly from the qcd dynamics , although treated within the thermal framework .",
    "recently , a new resummation scheme based on dimensionally reduced screened perturbation theory ( drspt ) was proposed @xcite . in certain sense , the efficiency of this drspt scheme even surpasses that of the htl perturbation theory .",
    "however , it still gives reliable results only above @xmath3 .",
    "to extend this perturbative description below @xmath1 , various phenomenological quasiparticle models @xcite were proposed .",
    "these models are formulated in terms of massive quarks and gluons and are constructed in such a way that at high temperatures they match the perturbative results and then extend them down in temperature .",
    "it is not clear , if a quasiparicle picture is relevant below @xmath1 at all .",
    "therefore , all these models are purely phenomenological .",
    "nevertheless , interpretation of lattice data within these quasiparticle models turned out to be very successful . with few phenomenological parameters it was possible to reasonably reproduce all lattice thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the feature of all above cited quasiparticle models , which still looks slightly irritating , is that they are formulated in terms of thermodynamic quantities ( i.e. temperature @xmath4 and baryon chemical potential @xmath5 ) rather than dynamical ones , like various densities . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the quasiparticle picture should be formulated in dynamical terms .",
    "the thermal equilibrium is only a particular case of this general picture . from the practical point of view , if the quasiparticle is introduced as a dynamical object , it would be possible to use a quasiparticle model for extending the equilibrium lattice description to ( at least , slightly ) nonequilibrium configurations , relying on reasonable reproduction of equilibrium properties by this model .",
    "such kind of extension is really required for analyzing heavy - ion collisions , where the thermalization is still a debating problem .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a simple quasiparticle model formulated in dynamical terms . in construction of this model , we proceed from properties of the perturbative solution to qcd , justifying the quasiparticle picture , rather than from first principles of qcd .",

    "this lagrangian is written proceeding from general features of the perturbative solution to qcd , which claims that quarks and transverse gluons are weakly interacting quasiparticles . here",

    "this implies that a strong interplay between quark  gluon and hadronic degrees of freedom occurs near @xmath2 , which actually determines the @xmath2 value itself .",

    "we have presented a simple quasiparticle model aimed to interpret the lattice qcd data . similarly to existing quasiparticle approaches @xcite , this model is motivated by the lowest - order perturbative qcd . however , contrary to those models , it is formulated in dynamical rather than thermodynamical terms . presently we have succeeded only for the case @xmath132 , where @xmath8 and @xmath133 are numbers of quark flavours and colors , respectively .",

    "the only problem with the `` 1-loop '' version is that it overestimates all lattice quantities by approximately 10% ( and slightly more for the baryonic density ) .",
    "however , since the overall normalization of the lattice data is indeed somewhat uncertain because of the poor extrapolation of these data to the continuum limit , this misfit is quite acceptable .    in spite of the difference in absolute values , `` internal '' quantities of the model , like effective quark and gluon masses and coupling constant ,",
    "reveal very similar behaviour as functions of temperature and chemical potential in both `` 1-loop '' and `` 2-loop '' versions .",
    "moreover , this behaviour is also similar to that in thermodynamic quasiparticle models @xcite .",
    "apparently , precisely this general trend is essential for reproduction of lattice data within both thermodynamic and present quasiparticle models .",
    "the presented model simulates the confinement of the qcd . in the equilibrium case considered here",
    ", the solution to the model equations simply does not exist below certain combination of the temperature and the chemical potential .",
    "in particular , this is the reason why we are able to fit the lattice quantities only above @xmath2 . in @xcite it is argued that below @xmath2 these quantities are quantitatively well described by the resonance hadronic gas . from this point of view",
    ", we can not count on proper description below @xmath2 , since the hadronic degrees of freedom are completely disregarded by the model .",
    "from both theoretical and practical points of view , it is desirable to include hadronic degrees of freedom in this model",
    ". then we could count on reproduction of eos in the whole range of temperatures and chemical potentials .",
