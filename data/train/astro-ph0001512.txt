    "the absorption components arising within 200  pc must first be identified and understood before attempting to study the kinematics of more distant ism structures .",
    "this work is the first attempt to three dimensionally ( l , b , d ) place components of interstellar gas in a localized region on the sky using optical absorption spectroscopy , and is preliminary to mapping clouds and extended structures at larger distances .",

    "_ 1985 and welsh _ et al .",
    ". there has be no localized , systematic study of the local gas toward puppis - vela until now .",
    "one implication of this lack of information is that lism data must be obtained from all sky surveys ( welsh it et al .",
    "1998 , gnova it et al . 1997 ) whose velocity and column density generalizations may not be indicative of the nature of lism gas in a specific direction . the identification of local velocity components toward puppis - vela performed here will allow local absorption features to be distinguished from more distant absorption features in any subsequent study of the ism in puppis - vela .",
    "questions posed by puppis - vela ism studies that are addressed here include : what is the contribution of the lic in this direction ? does the local bubble ( or cavity ) extend beyond @xmath6 70  pc in this direction ?",
    "are there any neutral velocity components in the lism in puppis - vela ?",
    "we investigate the kinematics and structure of the lism gas in puppis - vela using absorption line data of 11 stars with hipparcos - based distances @xmath4 200  pc , in conjunction with data for five previously studied lines of sight .",
    "the spectra presented here form a subset of a larger sample containing absorption spectra toward @xmath6 75 more distant stars in puppis - vela , which corroborate the conclusions made here , and will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "it is helpful to review the structures contained in the lism to more fully understand the puppis - vela lines of sight .",
    "the three known components of the lism include the local interstellar cloud ( lic ) , the g cloud , and the local bubble .",
    "the sun is moving through a warm ( t @xmath6 7000  k ) , low density ( n ( ) @xmath6 0.1@xmath17 ) , partially ionized interstellar cloud termed the lic ( lallement & ferlet 1997 , lallement & bertin 1992 ) .",
    "figure  1 shows a schematic diagram of the components of the lism as viewed from above the plane of the galaxy .",
    "the lic is observed in projection toward most but not all nearby stars , and extends approximately 3  8  pc .",
    "the lic is the only interstellar cloud where _ in situ _ measurements of interstellar dust grains ( baguhl _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) and interstellar gas ( witte _ et al .",
    "_ 1992 ) have been performed through _ ulysses _ & _ galileo _ spacecraft observations .",
    "models of the lic ( redfield & linsky 1999 ) place the sun just inside the lic , in the direction of the galactic center and toward the north galactic pole .",
    "the solar wind is carving out a cavity in the lic which is slightly elongated in the direction of relative motion of the sun in the lic . in the direction of the galactic center ,",
    "another cloud termed the g cloud is seen .",
    "this cloud is colder ( t @xmath6 5400  k ) ( linsky & wood 1996 ) and is approaching the sun at about 29 kms@xmath9 . from figure 1 , it is clear that the g cloud is not expected to be seen in the puppis - vela direction .",
    "since the sun is within the lic , interstellar sight lines in all directions contain absorption from gas associated with the lic , but these features are not always strong enough to be detected in absorption . specifically toward puppis - vela ,",
    "very low column densities of @xmath6 10@xmath18 to 10@xmath19 @xmath20 can be estimated using the empirical n(h)/n ( ) formula given by ferlet _",

    "the local bubble is an irregularly shaped region that radially extends approximately 70 pc from the sun ( welsh _ et al .",
    "the local bubble appears to protrude toward @xmath13 cma [ @xmath0 = 226 , @xmath2 = @xmath314 ] , forming an extention called the @xmath13 cma tunnel and borders the sight lines to puppis - vela .",
    "the extent of the tunnel is not well determined , and is discussed in detail in  6.3 .",
    "it is not yet known whether the local bubble is a bounded region created from a cataclysmic event such as a supernova explosion , or if the local bubble is an intercloud region , isolated by the boundaries of neighboring structures ( snowden _ et al .",
    "the majority of the volume of the local bubble is filled with hot x - ray emitting plasma with a characteristic temperature of t @xmath6 10@xmath23k , while most of the mass in the local bubble is cool and diffuse ( t @xmath6 100  k ) .",

    "estimates on the extent , distance , velocity and column density of previously undocumented components containing neutral gas are presented in  6 .",
    "the most abundant species in the lism is ; however , is more difficult to observe since space based instruments must be employed to measure its column density .",

    "_ 1978 , diplas & savage 1994 ) , and the ratio of n(h):n ( ) ( hobbs 1974a , 1974b , 1976 , stokes 1978 , and ferlet _ et al . _ 1985 ) .",
    "neither of these two methods of empirically calculating n ( ) are suitable for the study of the lism toward puppis - vela .",
    "the first method of calculating atomic hydrogen column densities given the color excesses of stars does not produce accurate results for sight lines with very low reddening since the uncertainties associated with the mk spectral type are large compared to the observed values of ( b@xmath3v ) .",

    "in addition to the lack of data points in the low column density limit , welty _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) have also noted that several of the low column density data points are incorrect .",
    "the large uncertainty in n(h):n ( ) in the low column density limit makes it useful for only order of magnitude estimates . as a point of reference , however , direct observations along several lines of sight in puppis - vela at d @xmath6 100 pc exhibit log n ( ) @xmath5 18.1 to 20.1 @xmath20 ( table 5.1 , dring 1997 ) .",

    "a standard data reduction procedure was followed that first included bias subtraction and flat - fielding of the science spectra .",
    "a thorium - argon arc lamp was the wavelength calibration source , and the stability of the ces yielded unchanging calibration exposures throughout each night .",
    "the calibration spectra were used in conjunction with the th - ar line list by willmarth ( 1987 ) to visually identify the emission lines , fit a second degree polynomial to the resulting pixel vs. wavelength arrays , and thereby convert our absorption line spectra from pixel to wavelength space .",

    "the instrumental resolution determined using the fwhm of the thorium lines for both observing runs was 3.1 kms@xmath9 , equivalent to @xmath33 @xmath5 95,000 .",
    "in addition to the interstellar absorption features , the raw spectra were contaminated by many telluric absorption lines which are abundant at wavelengths surrounding the d doublet .",
    "multiple observations of @xmath16 vir ( hd116658 ) were made since it is a nearby star with a high rotational velocity ( v sin i = 159 kms@xmath9 , hoffleit & jaschek 1982 ) and little interstellar absorption .",
    "these spectra were used as templates to remove telluric absorption lines contaminating the spectra . to normalize the template spectra ,",
    "the continuua were fit with cubic splines then divided by the fits .",
    "the optical depths of the atmospheric absorption lines in @xmath16 vir were adjusted by a multiplicative factor for each star so that the strength of the well separated telluric lines at wavelengths of 5883@xmath35901   matched those in each object spectrum .",
    "next , the object spectra were divided by the scaled @xmath16 vir template spectra to eliminate telluric absorption lines .",
    "the observed spectra were continuum normalized by fitting a cubic spline and dividing the object spectrum by the fit .",
    "the resulting spectra had signal - to - noise ratios of 110 to 250 .",
    "to fit the spectral lines and infer physical properties about the interstellar velocity components along each line of sight , we used the profile fitting method and software developed by welty , hobbs , & kulkarni ( 1994 ) .",
    "this technique assumes that the components have maxwellian velocity distributions .",
    "each line was fit with the fewest number of components necessary , and additional components either increased the @xmath34@xmath11 statistic or required that one or more components have unphysical b values .",
    "the parameters describing each component were adjusted by an iterative , non - linear , least - square method to achieve an rms deviation of the absorption line fit that was comparable to the rms deviation in the stellar continuum , and reduced the value of the @xmath34@xmath11 statistic .",

    "fs94 note that a _ copernicus _ spectrum toward @xmath10@xmath11 vel reveals h@xmath24 absorption which may be assigned to either component 4 or a blend of components 2 and 5 .",
    "although fs94 assign region origins to component 4 absorption because of the presence of species such as and , it is difficult to reconcile neutrals and molecules coexisting with such highly ionized species .",
    "fs94 propose that the region containing the component 4 gas is the @xmath6 40 pc surrounding a @xmath6 60 pc - radius stellar wind blown bubble centered on @xmath10@xmath11 vel .",
    "we suggest that there are two distinct regions of gas with velocities matching component 4 .",
    "first , the ionized region extending  100 pc from the star described in fs94 contains ionized gas at v@xmath8 @xmath5 13 kms@xmath9 .",
    "second , the neutral gas absorption along the line of sight to @xmath10@xmath11 vel at v@xmath8 @xmath5 13 kms@xmath9  occurs at d @xmath5 115 pc , corresponding with our component b. if the h@xmath24 spectrum is fit by component 4 , then it is consistent to place the h@xmath24 gas with the in component b , thereby providing a unique example of h@xmath24 gas near the edge , or possibly within , the local bubble .    not only is the mapping of the nearby gas essential in the characterization of the lism itself , this data clarified the complex absorption signature along the @xmath10@xmath11 vel line of sight , and should prove useful for other puppis - vela sight lines .",
    "caution must be observed , however , since it has been shown here and in other papers ( watson & meyer ( 1996 ) ; frail _ et al . _",
    "( 1994 ) ; lauroesch _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 , 1999 ) ) that interstellar is patchy , as evidenced by the subparsec - scale structures that appear to be ubiquitous in the diffuse ism , but this focused study will detect most components specific to the puppis - vela lism which previous all - sky local gas surveys ignored .      of the 27 absorption features detected ( excluding the ultra - high resolution data of dunkin & crawford ( 1999 ) ) along 16 lines of sight , 9 features have velocities outside of velocities a , b , and c. the peculiar velocities of all but three components can be understood with simple explanations .",
    "a total of three absorption components toward hd61831 and hd72232 lie just outside of the velocity ranges a , b , and c. it is likely that these absorption features are blends of multiple narrow lines that are unresolved at r @xmath6 100,000 , as evidenced by the many components distinguished in the ultra - high resolution data towards hd81188 cited in table  4 .",
    "three additional components toward hd65575 and hd106490 have peculiar velocities , but these stars are located at the periphery of the sample , and it is natural that at some point the characteristics of the gas change and components a , b , and c cease being detected .    in total , only 3 of 27 components can not be simply accounted for , and they include the v@xmath8 = + 132.3 kms@xmath9  and @xmath310.6 kms@xmath9  lines toward hd62226 and the v@xmath8 = @xmath3139 kms@xmath9  line toward hd74146 .",

    "the d@xmath24 absorption is plotted at the top , the d@xmath26 absorption is plotted in the middle of the panel . the residual to the best fit to the d@xmath24 spectrum is on the bottom , plotted with the y - axis ranging from @xmath30.015 to + 0.015 . unlike the spectra of the other lism sight lines in this region , that of hd62226 contains three components at three distinct velocities .",
    "the absorption at v@xmath8 = + 22.2 kms@xmath9  is consistent with the gas observed towards adjacent sight lines in the region , but the absorption features at v@xmath8 = @xmath310.6 kms@xmath9  and + 132.2 kms@xmath9  are not observed towards any other stars in the area .",
    "although lines of sight adjacent to hd62226 were also observed , namely hd61878 , hd64503 , and hd61831 , the spectra toward these stars do not show absorption at either v@xmath8 = @xmath310.6 kms@xmath9  or + 132.2 kms@xmath9 . because the sight line towards hd62226 is fortuitously flanked by these three nearby lines of sight that have also been observed ,",
    "it may be concluded that the gas producing the v@xmath8 = @xmath310.6 kms@xmath9  and + 132.2 kms@xmath9  components are confined to a small region projected on the sky at d @xmath4 190 pc .",
    "the v@xmath8 = @xmath310.6 kms@xmath9  component is very weak , but is clearly visible in both the d@xmath24 and d@xmath26 spectra .",
    "the d@xmath24/d@xmath26 ratio of equivalent widths for the + 132.2 kms@xmath9  lines equals 2.2 , which is close to the expected ratio of 2 for unsaturated d@xmath24 and d@xmath26 lines .",
    "the other sight line with unexplained components is that of hd74146 which also contains an absorption component at a high velocity , but here the feature is a broad ( b = 16.7 kms@xmath9 ) line at negative velocity , v@xmath8 = @xmath3139 kms@xmath9 , and d@xmath24/d@xmath26 = 0.8 .",
    "the breadth of the line and the low d@xmath24/d@xmath26 ratio are atypical of unsaturated interstellar lines , and it is unlikely that such a weak line could be saturated . additionally , several sight lines adjacent to hd74146 were also observed ( hd76805 , hd74071 , and hd74560 ) though their spectra did not reveal absorption at high negative velocities .    a literature search for information regarding whether or not circumstellar material has been observed around hd62226 or hd74146 yielded nothing . additionally , we attempted to use _ international ultraviolet explorer _",
    "( iue ) spectra to determine the origin of the high velocity absorption features .",
    "hd74146 was not observed with iue , and only one high dispersion spectrum of hd62226 was obtained .",
    "the single spectrum toward hd62226 had a low signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n @xmath4 10 ) , so the presence or absence of high velocity features associated with characteristic circumstellar or interstellar absorption could not be ascertained . with the data available , we were _ not _ able to determine whether the high velocity features in the spectra of hd62226 and hd74146 were of circumstellar or interstellar origin .",
    "in  2 it was mentioned that the extension of the local bubble ( or cavity ) known as the @xmath13 cma tunnel is adjacent to puppis - vela when projected on the sky .",

    "for instance , column densities of n ( ) @xmath6 10@xmath39 cm @xmath40 measured toward the 153@xmath1215 pc line of sight to @xmath13 cma are thought to arise primarily in gas along the first @xmath65 pc  within the lic ( gry _ et al .",
    "_ 1985 ) . in this section",
    ", previous estimates of the tunnel s extent will be reviewed and a new measurement of the size of the tunnel , within the first 150 pc , will be presented .",
    "after the low gas densities towards several stars in the direction of @xmath13 cma were noticed , subsequent studies of the lism probed adjacent sight lines to ascertain the size of the tunnel . using optical absorption spectroscopy to observe the d doublet , three estimates of the extent of the tunnel",
    "were made .",
    "first , welsh ( 1991 ) assigned minimum angular dimensions to the tunnel : an elliptical hole located at 226  @xmath14 @xmath0 @xmath14 242 , @xmath311  @xmath14 @xmath2 @xmath14 @xmath320 , extending to a depth of @xmath6300 pc .",

    "( 1999 ) included the @xmath13 cma tunnel in their maps of the neutral gas associated with the local bubble , but used only a few data points to confine the low gas density tunnel .",
    "their data is inconclusive regarding the depth of the tunnel and they proposed that the tunnel is either terminated at a distance of @xmath6 250 pc by absorbing gas producing equivalent widths of @xmath6 50 m , or that the boundary of the tunnel is closer but contains several perforations .    the maps illustrating the tunnel in welsh _ et al . _",

    "( 1999 ) do not represent differences in the stars galactic latitude , however .",
    "both papers show the tunnel on plots of distance versus galactic longitude with the stars projected onto the galactic plane , thus obscuring information regarding the galactic latitude of the target stars .",

    "our observations add a new dimension to the tunnel boundary since the target stars in our sample are concentrated within @xmath2 @xmath6 @xmath310  to 0 .",
    "in addition to the column density measurements given in tables  2 and 4 for stars toward puppis - vela , n ( ) measurements along sight lines in and around the @xmath13 cma tunnel were compiled .",

    "there is no observational evidence to determine whether the @xmath13 cma tunnel extends past @xmath0 @xmath5 250at lower galactic latitudes , since no sight lines have been observed there .",
    "the lower galactic longitude boundary also appears to encompass sight lines with high column densities , and should be relocated to @xmath0 @xmath36 215 . from the compilation of data on almost 40 lines of sight , it appears that outside the local bubble ( d @xmath35 70 pc ) , low neutral gas densities are to be found between @xmath0 @xmath5 215  to 250  and @xmath2 @xmath5 @xmath321  to @xmath39 .",
    "the arc drawn in figure  7 at d @xmath6 150 pc illustrates the extent in galactic longitude over which low column density lines of sight with @xmath2 @xmath14 @xmath310  have been observed .",

    "there is a region of low density towards @xmath13 cma , but it is not clear whether the tunnel is present in the plane of the galaxy .",
    "additional observations along sight lines 0  to 30  below the galactic plane are needed to clarify the three dimensional extent of the @xmath13 cma tunnel .",
    "we have presented high resolution spectra toward 11 early type stars plus kinematic data for 5 lines of sight taken from the literature to study the lism in the direction of puppis - vela .",
    "additionally , we have compiled a list of column density measurements made toward nearby ( d @xmath4 200 pc ) sight lines in the @xmath13 cma tunnel .",
    "our conclusions are stated below :    \\1 .",
    "observations of in the lism toward puppis - vela revealed absorption at three distinct velocities with the following properties : component a[@xmath0 @xmath5 276  to 298 , @xmath2 @xmath5 @xmath35  to + 4 ] , v@xmath8 = + 6 to + 9 kms@xmath9 , and d @xmath6 104 pc ; component b[@xmath0 @xmath5 264  to 276 , @xmath2 @xmath5 @xmath37  to + 3 ] , v@xmath8 = + 12 to + 15 kms@xmath9 , and d @xmath6 115 pc ; component c[@xmath0 @xmath5 252  to 271 , @xmath2 @xmath5 @xmath38  to @xmath36 ] , v@xmath8 = + 21 to + 23 kms@xmath9 , and d @xmath6 131 pc .",
