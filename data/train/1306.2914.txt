    "solution of sturm - liouville equations and of a wide range of related direct and inverse spectral problems is at the core of modern mathematical physics and its numerous applications . since the work of j. fourier on the theory of the heat and his method of separation of variables the properties and methods for solving different kinds of sturm - liouville spectral problems were studied in thousands of publications .",
    "one of the important mathematical tools for approaching problems related to sturm - liouville equations was introduced in 1938 by j. delsarte @xcite and called delsartelions1956 the transmutation operator .",
    "it relates two linear differential operators and allows one to transform a more complicated equation into a simpler one . nowadays",
    "the transmutation operator is widely used in the theory of linear differential equations ( see , e.g. , begehrgilbert , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "very often in literature the transmutation operators are called the transformation operators .",
    "it is well known that under certain regularity conditions the transmutation operator transmuting the operator @xmath0 into @xmath1 is a volterra integral operator with good properties .",
    "its integral kernel can be obtained as a solution of a certain goursat problem for the klein - gordon equation with a variable coefficient . in spite of their attractive properties and importance there",
    "exist very few examples of the transmutation kernels available in a closed form ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in the recent work @xcite it was observed that the kernel of the transmutation operator relating the schrdinger operator @xmath2 with @xmath3 is a complex component of a bicomplex - valued pseudoanalytic function of a hyperbolic variable @xcite , a solution of a hyperbolic vekua equation of a special form .",
    "the other component of that pseudoanalytic function is the transmutation kernel corresponding to a darboux associated schrdinger operator @xcite .",
    "this observation combined with some new results concerning such hyperbolic pseudoanalytic functions allowed us to obtain @xcite a new and extremely convenient representation for the transmutation kernel in terms of so - called generalized wave polynomials kktt .    in the present work",
    "we develop this result into a practical method for solving a wide spectrum of initial value , boundary value and spectral problems for the one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath4 .",
    "the mentioned above convenience of the representation of the kernel consists in the fact that with respect to the variable of integration the kernel results to be a polynomial . since to obtain solutions of the schrdinger equation",
    "the transmutation operator is applied to the functions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , solutions of the simplest such equation @xmath7 , all the involved integrals are calculated explicitly .",
    "the coefficients of the polynomial are functions of another independent variable @xmath8 .",
    "due to the developed theory they can be found as a result of approximation of the pair of functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 in terms of a specially constructed family of functions . here",
    "@xmath11 is a constant defined below .",
    "the family of functions is the family of traces of the generalized wave polynomials on the lines @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the plane @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the method developed and presented in this paper for solving spectral problems for the schrdinger operator consists in the following steps .    1 .",
    "construction of a particular solution for the equation @xmath15 .",
    "2 .   construction of certain recursive integrals which serve for calculating the family of traces of the generalized wave polynomials .",
    "approximation of the pair of functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 by a linear combination of the traces .",
    "computation of the solution of the schrdinger equation or of a characteristic function of the spectral problem in a domain of interest as a function of the spectral parameter @xmath18 .",
    "localization of the eigenvalues as zeros of the characteristic function .",
    "several advantages of the method should be emphasized .",
    "* the error of the computed eigendata does not increase for higher eigenvalues .",
    "one can compute , e.g. , the @xmath19th eigenvalue and eigenfunction with roughly the same accuracy as the first ones . * a quite simple a - priori control of the accuracy of",
    "the computed eigendata is available .",
    "as we show , the accuracy of the computed eigendata is entirely linked to the accuracy of approximation of the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 on step 3 .",
    "this error of approximation is easily calculated .",
    "if it is inadmissible , more approximating functions should be taken . *",
    "the method works equally well in the case of complex - valued coefficients and spectral parameter dependent boundary conditions . *",
    "the method allows one to obtain highly accurate eigendata .",
    "for example , for a standard test problem ( the paine problem @xcite ) we present eigendata corresponding to @xmath20 computed with the accuracy of the order @xmath21 . for the coffey - evans problem well known for being extremely difficult for numerical computation due to neatly clustered eigenvalues",
    "the achieved accuracy is of the order @xmath22 .",
    "note that even for @xmath23 the solution of the coffey - evans equation delivered by the built - in mathematica s function ndsolve was computed at best with an absolute error greater than @xmath24 .",
    "the main results presented in this paper are aimed to give a rigorous justification of the developed method .",
    "we prove that the central object of the transmutation kernel representation , the set of traces of the generalized wave polynomials is complete in the required functional spaces and therefore the set can be used for approximating the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we obtain corresponding estimates for the accuracy of approximation of the transmutation kernel .",
    "further estimates concerning the accuracy of the resulting approximation of solutions of the schrdinger equation and the independence of the accuracy of largeness of @xmath18 are proved as well .",
    "we show that the same approximation coefficients obtained on step 3 can be used to obtain a related approximation for the transmutation kernel for the darboux associated schrdinger operator .",
    "this is important for considering problems involving derivatives in boundary conditions .",
    "the numerical experiments were performed in mathematica with multiple - precision arithmetic .",
    "the main reason for not restricting our computations to the machine precision consists in a fuller exploration of the method , its capabilities and features .",
    "for example , the results of involved computations obtained with a high precision allow us to study more completely the link between the accuracy of the approximation ( step 3 ) and of the resulting computed eigendata .",
    "this study reveals that the absolute error of the approximation essentially coincides with the final error in the eigendata and decays exponentially with respect to the number @xmath25 of traces used , which for practical purposes means that an accurate approximation of the functions @xmath16 and @xmath17 by the system of traces of generalized polynomials guarantees the computation of arbitrarily high eigendata with the same accuracy .",
    "however the complete description of the class of potentials for which the approximation and eigendata errors decay exponentially and rigorous proofs of the observed relation between approximation errors and eigendata errors remain for the future research .    due to the difficulties with construction of the kernels of transmutation operators",
    "there were very few attempts for their practical use in numerical solution of spectral problems . in this relation",
    "we mention the paper @xcite where certain analytic approximation formulas for the transmutation kernels were obtained . to our knowledge",
    "the present paper is a first publication offering an efficient and highly accurate ( and to our opinion clearly promising ) numerical algorithm based on the transmutation operators for solving spectral problems for the schrdinger operator .",
    "one of the direct applications requiring a large number of eigendata computed with a considerable and non - decreasing accuracy arises from the fourier method of separation of variables .",
    "according to the method the solution admits an analytic expression in the form of a series which in practice is known to be slowly convergent .",
    "the method presented here allows one to calculate partial sums of such series containing large numbers of terms in a fast and accurate manner .    in the next section [ section2 ] we recall some definitions and properties concerning the transmutation operators . in section [ section3 ]",
    "we introduce the system of generalized wave polynomials . in section [ section4 ]",
    "we prove the completeness of their traces in appropriate functional spaces . in section [ sectapprox ]",
    "we construct the approximate kernels of the transmutation operators and obtain corresponding estimates for their accuracy . in section [ section6 ]",
    "we obtain the main result of the paper , the formulas for approximate solutions of the schrdinger equation @xmath26 as well as for their derivatives and prove corresponding estimates for their accuracy .",
    "section [ section7 ] is dedicated to the description of the algorithm and its numerical implementation , the proof of the uniform error bounds for the approximate zeros of characteristic functions of sturm - liouville spectral problems as well as to the presentation of numerical results .",
    "we give a definition of a transmutation operator from @xcite which is a modification of the definition proposed by levitan @xcite , adapted to the purposes of the present work .",
    "let @xmath27 be a linear topological space and @xmath28 its linear subspace ( not necessarily closed ) .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be linear operators : @xmath29 .

    "one of the possibilities to introduce a transmutation operator on @xmath27 was considered by lions @xcite and later on in other references ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and consists in constructing a volterra integral operator corresponding to a midpoint of the segment of interest . as we begin with this transmutation operator",

    "it is worth mentioning that other well known ways to construct the transmutation operators ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) imply imposing initial conditions on the functions and consequently lead to transmutation operators satisfying ( [ attb ] ) only on subclasses of @xmath28 .",
