    "observations with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) have provided a large data base of  absorption lines at low and intermediate redshifts , in particular those from the hst quasar absorption lines key project ( bahcall et al .",
    "1991 , 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "for the lower redshift  absorbers , several optical identification searches have been conducted with ground - based telescopes to determine their nature , their cross - section and their link with galaxy populations .",
    "two complementary approaches have been pursued , one based on extensive local galaxy - redshift surveys , the other on large , homogeneous  absorption line samples .",
    "the first approach was adopted by morris et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , stocke et al . ( 1995 ) and shull et al . ( 1996 ) and requires to obtain high - resolution and signal - to - noise ratio spectra of nearby quasars located behind or within the regions sampled by the cfa redshift surveys ( e.g. 3c  273 , mrk 501 ) .",
    "there are usually only a few  absorption lines per sightline , furthermore with very low rest - frame equivalent widths ( @xmath4 20 - 300  m ) , and the above authors have used complete galaxy catalogs to characterize the locations of the  absorbers relative to galaxies ( including dwarf galaxies ) .",
    "a crucial result is the discovery of three  absorbers in voids of large - scale structures and , for the most extreme case ( definite  absorption ) , the nearest known neighboring galaxy lies 8.8 @xmath5  mpc ( where @xmath6 is the hubble constant in units of 50 km s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 and adopting @xmath8 ) away from the absorber ( stocke et al . 1995 ) .",
    "this implies that some  absorbers ( mainly those of low column densities ) are not tightly linked to galaxies , or even to regions of matter overdensities .",
    "however , for the majority of these low - redshift  absorbers ( 7/10 in the shull et al.s sample ) , there is a galaxy within @xmath9  mpc .    in the other approach ,",
    "studies of fields around quasars observed with the hst faint object spectrograph ( fos ) aim at identifying  absorbers at intermediate redshifts , @xmath10 , with larger  equivalent widths , @xmath11  m .",
    "lanzetta et al .",
    "( 1995 , hereafter referred to as lbtw ) have found that the majority of the absorbers are directly associated with extended gaseous galactic halos , a result not confirmed by le  brun et al .",
    "( 1996 , hereafter referred to as lbb ) who used a more homogeneous sample of  lines .",
    "the main conclusion reached by lbb is consistent with the results obtained for absorbers at lower redshift : the majority of  absorbers arise in gaseous regions spread along the large - scale structures of the galaxy distribution and only a small fraction of them trace extended galactic halos ( @xmath12  kpc ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the evolution of the gaseous content of the universe ( petitjean et al .",
    "1995 , mcket et al .",
    "1996 ) are also consistent with this picture .",
    "the nature of these absorbers is more easily established at low redshift . if the  absorbers are then shown to primarily trace large - scale structures , their study over a large redshift range ( up to 4 - 5 ) will provide information on the evolution of large - scale structures and will thus constrain cosmological models .    in this paper , we present further observations from our identification programme of intermediate redshift  absorbers and report on our results for the field around the quasar 3c  286 .",
    "we have analyzed in details the uv spectrum of this quasar , for a study of the @xmath13 damped  system ( boiss et al .",
    "1998 ) , as well as deep hst / wfpc2 images of the field surrounding the quasar .",
    "we have also obtained the spectra of 31 galaxies within 4  to the quasar sightline , successfully measuring 25 redshifts .",
    "this data set increases the existing sample of galaxy/-absorber pairs , and helps to further constrain the nature of the  forest .",

    "the galaxies without associated  absorption can therefore be easily separated from the sample of absorber - galaxy associations .",
    "furthermore , the relative velocity distribution between a galaxy and the nearest   absorber is highly peaked for the  absorber - galaxy associations whereas it is flat for the non - associations .",
    "this strengthens the suggestion that , even if the absorbers are not directly linked to galaxies , they are not distributed at random with respect to large - scale structures as traced by galaxies since the @xmath155 distribution strongly departs from uniformity .",
    "the cumulated fraction of  absorber - galaxy associations as a function of impact parameter is shown in fig .",
