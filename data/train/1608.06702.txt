    "the search for life elsewhere has been a very fascinating area in recent years .",
    "a lot of efforts have been channeled in this direction in the form of space missions in search for the potential habitable planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "analysis of huge volume of collected planetary data from space missions such as corot and kepler is directed at finding a planet similar to earth ",
    "the earth s twin , and answering the question of exo - habitability .",
    "the challenge here is to determine which exoplanet parameter(s ) are important in finding this similarity . in order to address this challenge , the earth similarity index ( esi ) , a parametric index to analyze the exoplanets data ,",
    "was introduced to assess the earth likeness of exoplanets @xcite .",
    "this multi - parameter esi scale depends on radius , density , escape velocity and surface temperature of a planet .",
    "the esi index is used by the planetary habitability laboratory ( phl ) , university of puerto rico , arecibo , to estimate the potential habitability of all discovered to date exoplanets .",
    "here , the total esi ranges from 1 ( identical to earth ) to 0 ( totally dissimilar to earth ) . a planet with esi @xmath0",
    "is considered an earth - like , but even planets with esi @xmath1 ( e.g. mars ) are optimistically called potentially habitable planets ( php ) . as of now ( june 2016 ) , there are 42 assumed phps .",
    "we focus on indexing the exoplanet data taken from the online exoplanets catalog ( phl - ec ) maintained by the phl .",
    "the esi is subdivided into the interior esi , depending on radius and density , and exterior esi , depending on escape velocity and surface temperature of a planet ; and the total ( global ) esi is their geometric mean .",
    "our objective is to establish how the individual parameters entering the interior esi and surface esi , are contributing to the global esi , using graphical analysis approach .",
    "presently , one of the esi parameters , the mean surface temperature , is estimated for the rocky planets in phl - ec by following a correction factor of 30 - 33 k , based on the earth s greenhouse effect .",
    "the main objective of our work in calculations of the global esi is to try to introduce a better estimate of the surface temperature of rocky exoplanets , because it may be a crucial element in the search for habitable planets ( carone et al .",
    "2016 ) . in addressing the habitability question",
    ", we shall not ignore the good quality data available within our own solar system . from graphical analysis of the known data for some of the solar system objects , we establish the calibrated relation between surface and equilibrium temperatures .",
    "this relation is extended to estimate the surface temperatures of exoplanets from their equilibrium temperatures .",
    "though earth is currently the only place where life as we know it exists , there is a good probability that life could have existed on mars in the past ( abramov & mojzsis , 2016 ) .",
    "indeed , mars is technically inside the sun s habitable zone ( hz ) , though its esi is only 0.73",
    ". however , mars - like conditions may be suitable for the extremophile life forms , such as the ones living in extreme environments on earth ( numerous experiments have proven several organisms to survive the simulated martian conditions , e.g. onofri et al .",
    "reports on the presence of methane in the martian atmosphere ( webster et al .",
    "2015 ) raise the possibility of the existence of a methane - specific extremophile life forms ; in fact , on earth methanogens thrive in conditions similar to martian environments : in dry desert soils and in 3-km deep glacial ice ( see hu et al .",
    "2016 and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , we are interested in mars similarity to look for planets potentially habitable by extremophiles , say extreme phps .",
    "we introduce the new indexing formulation , called mars similarity index ( msi ) , where the range is 1 ( present mars ) and 0 ( no similarity to present mars ) .",
    "mars here represents a sort of test - bed that can indicate the potential habitability of small rocky planets . a planet with msi @xmath2",
    "is recognized to be mars - like , e.g. earth , which is a habitable planet .",
    "we find from our data analysis six mars - like planets ( mars , earth , kepler-186  f , kepler-442  b , kepler-438  b , kepler-62  f , gj 667c  c , gj 667c  f ) , which are also included in the php list .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  2 , we give the detailed derivation of the esi and msi scales .",
    "data analysis is presented in section  3 , which includes esi analysis , surface temperature analysis , and msi analysis as subsections .",
    "finally , discussion and conclusions are given in section  4 .",
    "distance / similarity measurements are widely used in , for example , classification of objects , clustering and retrieval problems , or to compute the overlaps between quantitative data . here",
    ", the distance @xmath3 is represented as dissimilarity , and proximity is equivalent to similarity @xmath4 .",
    "mathematically , the concept of distance is a metric one  a measure of a true distance in euclidean space @xmath5 .",
    "this problem can be addressed by using minkowski s space of @xmath6 form @xcite , in which @xmath7-norm stands for finite @xmath8-dimensional vector space , @xmath9 where the city - block , or manhattan , @xmath10 distance @xmath11 and euclidean @xmath12 distance @xmath13 are the special cases . here , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the coordinates of @xmath7 and @xmath16 in dimension @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath10 form has an advantage that it can be decomposed into contributions made by each variable being the sum of absolute differences ( e.g. for the @xmath12 form , it would be the decomposition of the squared distance ) .",
    "we are interested in finding similarities between different planets based on their various characteristics , in other words , a multivariate data sets . in such cases , especially abundant in ecological and environmental studies to quantify the differences between samples collected at different sampling locations ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the bray - curtis distance is the most used scale @xcite .",
    "bray - curtis is a modified manhattan distance , where the summed differences between the variables are standardized by the summed variables of the objects , @xmath19 here @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two different precisely measurable quantities between which the distance is to be measured , and @xmath8 is the total number of variables .",
    "the assumption in the bray - curtis scale is that samples are taken from same physical measure , e.g. mass , or volume .",
    "it is because the distance is found from the raw counts , so that if there is a higher abundance in one sample comparing to the other , it is a part of the difference between the two samples .",
    "the advantage of the bray - curtis scale is its simplicity in interpretation : @xmath20 means the samples are exactly the same , and @xmath21 means they are completely disjoint .",
    "it shall be kept in mind that bray - curtis distance is not the true metric distance , it is a semi - metric distance ( in which the distance between two distinct points can be zero ) , which is usually called dissimilarity , or ecological distance @xcite .",
    "the advantages in using the ecological distance is that differences between datasets can be expressed by a single statistic .",
    "the intersection between two distributions is more widely used form of similarity ( as opposed to distance ) .",
    "most similarity measures for intersection can be transformed from the distance measure by the transformation technique ( see bloom 1981 , but not exclusively ) , @xmath22 here , the value of @xmath20 means complete absence of relationships , and the value of @xmath21 shows a complete matching of the two data records in the @xmath8-dimensional space @xcite .",
    "distances / similarities based on heterogeneous data can be found after a process of standardization  balancing of the contribution of different types of variables in an equitable way @xcite .",
    "one way to do that is to calculate the similarity for each set of homogeneous variables and then combine them using various methods ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : esi calculation ] ) .",
    "higher values in one set may impact the result of the bray - curtis similarity more dominantly and imply that these variables are more likely to discriminate between sets .",
    "therefore , user - defined weighting is a convenient ( though subjective ) method for down - weighing the differences for a set of variables .    in our case , we would like to compare sets of different variables of one planet with that of the reference value , for example , earth , to find planets that are similar to earth . rewriting eq .",

    "they would have adapted to the currently existing conditions and just like the terrestrial extremophiles would need such conditions for the survival ; for example , terrestrial methanogens have developed biological mechanism that allows them to repair dna and protein damage to survive at temperatures from @xmath45c to @xmath78c @xcite .",

    "carbon and water have the dominant role as the backbone molecule and a solvent of biochemistry for earth life .",
    "however , the abundance of carbon may not be a useful indication of the habitability of an exoplanet .",
    "the earth is actually significantly depleted in carbon compared with the outer solar system . here ,",

    "we have introduced the mars similarity index to study the mars - like planets as potential planets to host extremophile life forms . in this scale , moon has the msi of @xmath79 , earth has the msi of @xmath80 , and the next closest exoplanet is kepler-186 f ( msi=0.69 ) , which is listed as potentially habitable planet in the hec . mars - like planets",
    "can tell us about the habitability of small worlds rather than planets that are far from their star .",
    "for example , earth at mars distance would most probably still be habitable @xcite . given constant exchange of impact ejecta between the planets , it is possible that biota from the earth reached and survived on mars , which thus could have been ` extremophile'-habitable throughout all its history .    based on the above work",
    ", we conclude that it is necessary to arrive at the a multiparameter calculator without any confinement to the number of input parameters ( e.g. orbital properties , temperature , escape velocity , radius , density , activation energy and so on ) .",
    "we would like to call this future calculator a life information score ( lis ) , which shall be used as an overall calculator to detect life itself .",
    "the lis is almost similar to the anthropic selection , which basically deals with the preconditions for the emergence of life and , ultimately , intelligent observers @xcite .",

    "<S> the challenge here is to determine which exoplanet parameter(s ) is important in finding this similarity ; how exactly the individual parameters entering the interior esi and surface esi are contributing to the global esi . since the surface temperature entering surface esi is a non - observable quantity </S>",
    "<S> , it is difficult to determine its value . using the known data for the solar system objects , we established the calibration relation between surface and equilibrium temperatures to devise an effective way to estimate the value of the surface temperature of exoplanets for further analysis with our graphical methodology .    </S>",
    "<S> esi is a first step in determining potential exo - habitability that may not be very similar to a known life . a new approach , called mars similarity index ( msi ) , </S>",
    "<S> is introduced to identify planets that may be habitable to the extreme forms of life . </S>",
    "<S> msi is defined in the range between 1 ( present mars ) and 0 ( dissimilar to present mars ) and uses the same physical parameters as esi . </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in mars - like planets to search for planets that may host the extreme life forms , such as the ones living in extreme environments on earth ; for example , methane on mars may be a product of the methane - specific extremophile life form metabolism .    </S>",
