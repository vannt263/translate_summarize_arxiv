    "measurements of metallicity combined with accumulated stellar mass and gas content therefore provide stringent constraints on the baryonic processes relevant to galaxy formation .",

    "this is commonly attributed to outflows of metal - enriched gas driven by intense star formation , supported by observations that such feedback is ubiquitous among galaxies with high densities of star formation @xcite .",
    "the _ spatial _ distribution of metallicity within a galaxy further constrains the baryonic assembly history , in particular the effects of outflows and dynamical evolution .",
    "star - forming disk galaxies in the local universe have negative radial metallicity gradients ( higher metallicity in the central regions ; see @xcite and @xcite for large samples ) .",
    "this has been explained by models of chemical evolution in which galaxies grow _ inside - out _ such that outer regions have younger characteristic ages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gradients typically flatten at large radii indicating efficient mixing in those regions , possibly due to secular dynamical evolution or recycling of metal - enriched gas which was previously ejected in outflows ( so - called  galactic fountains  ; e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "this work is concerned with using time evolution of metallicity gradients as a probe of galaxy formation .",
    "we seek to measure how gradients evolve , and to understand what processes drive that evolution .",
    "a variety of predictions have been made based on numerical models of inside - out growth , ranging from steeper to flatter to inverted ( positive ) gradients at higher redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "cosmological simulations have recently begun to address this issue , with several groups arguing that gradient evolution depends strongly on star formation feedback : stronger feedback is predicted to cause flatter gradients due to rapid gas recycling @xcite .",

    "data reaching @xmath4 kpc resolution with adaptive optics ( and up to @xmath5100 pc in the case of lensed galaxies ) have revealed negative radial gradients with slopes often steeper than local descendants , suggesting that gradients flatten as galaxies grow with time @xcite .",
    "larger surveys with seeing - limited resolution of @xmath55 kpc have reported mostly flat gradients with a significant fraction of positive slopes @xcite .",

    "high spatial resolution is clearly an advantage ; @xcite demonstrate how degraded resolution can dramatically bias gradient measurements . for typical - size galaxies at high redshift ,",

    "these results demonstrate the potential of the full glass survey to obtain dozens of such measurements at @xmath9 and thus reliably determine the average evolution of metallicity gradients over the past 11 gyr .    throughout this paper",

    "the precision of the inversion was evaluated by comparing for each set of multiple images the promixity of the inferred source position , and the agreement beetween source plane flux and morphology . however",
    ", even the best global model produced significant residual differences between the reconstructed sources , requiring an additional step , as described in the next paragraph .    in order to take full advantage of the multiple images of each arc system",

    "this allows us to reduce the lensing - related uncertainties and combine the data from multiple images to increase the signal - to - noise ratio of emission line maps .",
    "the full details of our methodology will be presented by wang et al .",
    "( 2014 , in prep ) ; here we give only a brief overview .",
    "essentially , we are considering the global cluster model as an approximate first solution and we are seeking corrections to the potential to improve the reconstruction .",
    "we assume that the corrections are small and can thus be described by a local correction to the lensing potential up to the first two orders of derivatives .",
    "the first order term consists of a correction to the deflection angle for each image .",
    "the second order term yields corrections to the shear and convergence .",
    "the procedure has thus five free parameters per image .",
    "the optimal parameters are found by requiring the source plane reconstructions of each set of multiple images to be as similar to each other as possible .",
    "we note that a direct byproduct of this formalism is a correction to the magnification of each image .",
    "we have applied this method to the arc systems 3 , 4 , and 14 , using the least distorted ( i.e. , least magnified ) image of each system as a reference .",
    "figure  [ fig : lenscorr ] shows multiple images of arc 14 reconstructed with and without the lens model corrections to illustrate the advantage .",
    "the source plane positions are offset by @xmath30 kpc using the original model , while the model corrections produce consistent positions and morphologies for all three reconstructed images .",
    "the second order correction is thus sufficient for our purposes . in all cases",
    "the correction is relatively small , amounting to @xmath31% of the total lensing deflection angle . in the following analysis",
    "we combine emission line maps from multiple images in the source plane in order to increase the measurement precision .",
    "however , including less highly magnified images provides a marginal improvement at the cost of degraded spatial resolution .",
    "we therefore use arcs 3.1@xmath323.2 , arc 4.1 only , and arcs 14.1@xmath3214.3 to optimize resolution and sensitivity .",
    "final results are consistent with measurements from individual images , as well as with results derived from the original lens model .",
    "combining multiple images improves the precision in metallicity gradients by an impressive factor of @xmath33 for arcs 3 and 14 by enabling finer spatial sampling and detection of more extended low surface brightness emission .",
    "we derive a conservative uncertainty of 13% rms in the magnification factors ( prior to second order correction ) by comparing measured flux ratios of multiple images with model - predicted magnification ratios .",

    "the high sfr surface density of arc 3 is sufficient to drive outflows with high mass loading factors @xcite as required by these simulations .",
