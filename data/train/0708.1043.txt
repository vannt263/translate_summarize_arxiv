    "the evaluation of correlation functions has been one of the challenging problems in research on quantum many - body systems in one - dimension , since most of the intriguing phenomena induced by underlying strong quantum fluctuations are theoretically described through correlation functions . in these systems",
    ", it is widely known that the existence of models which are solvable by means of bethe ansatz ( see @xcite for example ) . though the exact computation of correlation functions , of course , is still tremendously difficult even in such models , several analytical methods have been recently developed to derive manageable expressions for correlation functions , especially in the spin-1/2 heisenberg xxz chain .    in 1990s , correlation functions of the spin-1/2 xxz chain at zero temperature and for zero magnetic field",
    "have been expressed as multiple integral forms derived by the @xmath1-vertex operator approach @xcite .",
    "an alternative method combining the algebraic bethe ansatz with solutions to the quantum inverse problem has been provided for the xxz chain in arbitrary magnetic fields @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "this method can be generalized to the finite - temperature and/or the time - dependent correlation functions @xcite .    in general , one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum spin systems",
    "are mapped to 1d fermion systems through the jordan - wigner transformation . for the spin-1/2 xxz chain ,",
    "the corresponding system is a spinless fermion model with the nearest neighbor hopping and interaction . in the thermodynamic limit , the bulk quantities in the xxz chain are exactly the same as those in the spinless fermion model .",
    "namely , in the 1d quantum systems , the difference of the statistics between the spin and the fermion does not show up , as long as we concentrate on their bulk quantities .",
    "the situation , however , is radically changed when the quantities accompanying a change of the number of particles are considered .",
    "for instance , let us consider the ( equal - time ) one - particle green s function @xmath2 for the spinless fermion model and the transverse spin - spin correlation function @xmath3 for the xxz chain , which are intuitively the same .",
    "in fact , due to the difference of the statistics , or equivalently the nonlocality of the jordan - wigner transformation , both the correlation functions exhibit completely different behavior .",
    "for instance , one observes an oscillatory behavior for the one - particle green s function ( referred to as the @xmath4-oscillation , where @xmath4 is the fermi momentum ) , which is peculiar to the fermion systems .",
    "in contrast , for the transverse spin - spin correlation function , such an oscillatory behavior does not appear .",
    "as mentioned above , exact expressions for the correlation functions of the xxz chain have already been proposed in the form of multiple integral representations .",
    "unfortunately , once the jordan - wigner transformation is performed and the xxz chain is considered instead of the spinless fermion model , it is difficult to trace the difference of the statistics in the framework of multiple integral representations .",
    "namely , to derive a manageable expression of correlation functions for the spinless fermion model , we must directly treat the fermion system from the very beginning .    in this paper",
    ", introducing the fermionic @xmath0-operator @xcite which acts on the fermion fock space , we directly treat the spinless fermion model without mapping to the xxz chain . combining the method provided in the xxz chain @xcite with solutions to the inverse scattering problem of local fermion operators @xcite",
    ", we derive a multiple integral representing the equal - time one - particle green s function and the density - density correlation function at zero temperature both for any interaction strengths and for arbitrary particle densities .",
    "our formulae reproduce the known results for the free fermion model .",
    "in addition to the correlation functions , we also compute form factors for local fermion operators , which might be useful for systematic evaluations of the spectral functions for the spinless fermion model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the subsequent section ,",
    "we introduce the fermionic @xmath0-operator and the transfer operator constructed by the @xmath0-operator",
    ". then we briefly review the algebraic bethe ansatz for the spinless fermion model .",
    "the scalar product of a bethe state with an arbitrary state is presented in section 3 .",
    "combining solutions of the inverse scattering problem with the scalar product , we compute form factors of local fermion operators .",
    "multiple integral representations for correlation functions are derived in section 4 . in section 5 , using the multiple integral representations , we explicitly evaluate correlation functions for the free fermion model .",
    "section 6 is devoted to a brief conclusion .",

    "the difference between the spinless fermion model and the corresponding xxz chain lies only in the difference of boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , in the thermodynamic limit , the quantities without accompanying a change of the number of particles such as the density - density correlation function @xmath21 are exactly the same as those such as a longitudinal spin - spin correlation function @xmath22/4 for the xxz chain . as mentioned in the preceding section , however , the quantities changing the number of particles such as the one - particle green s function @xmath23 exhibit completely different behavior from those such as the transverse spin - spin correlation function @xmath3 , due to the nonlocality of the jordan - wigner transformation .",
    "though the exact expression of @xmath24 for the xxz chain has already been presented in @xcite , it is difficult to convert it to the expression for the spinless fermion model , as long as we concentrate on the xxz chain",

    "hence the same method described in @xcite can be applied to derive the exact expression of @xmath214 . here",
    "we derive it by using and .",
    "set @xmath271 .",
    "then @xmath272 in is factorized as @xmath273 , which significantly simplifies the integral representation . after taking the derivative of with respect to @xmath235 and setting @xmath274",
    ", one finds all the terms except for @xmath275 vanish . substituting @xmath276 , and taking the lattice derivative",
    ", one obtains @xmath277 where @xmath278 the integral on @xmath222 can be evaluated by considering the residues outside the contour @xmath222 i.e. at the points @xmath279 and @xmath50 .",
    "it immediately follows that @xmath280 changing the variables @xmath281 ( @xmath282 $ ] ) , where @xmath283 $ ] is the fermi momentum determined by @xmath284 ( see section 2 ) , and identifying @xmath285 , one arrives at @xmath286,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath287 is the particle density given by .",
    "this expression agrees with the well - known result . at zero chemical potential @xmath102 , where the fermi momentum corresponds to @xmath288 ,",
    "one finds @xmath289    next let us discuss the one - particle green s function @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath290 for @xmath265 , only the term corresponding to @xmath291 survives in . namely @xmath292.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to evaluate the above integral explicitly , we shift the @xmath50-contour @xmath250 to @xmath86 .",
    "since the integrand is antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , the resulting integral vanishes : we only have to take into account the poles surrounded by the @xmath50-contour @xmath252 i.e. @xmath293 . after evaluating the integral with respect to @xmath294 by the method used in the calculation for the density - density correlation function",
    ", one has @xmath295 changing the variables as explained before , one finally obtains @xmath296.\\ ] ] this also coincides with the well - known result .",
    "in particular at zero chemical potential @xmath102 ( @xmath297 ) , one sees @xmath298",
    "in this paper , correlation functions for the spinless fermion model have been discussed by using the fermionic @xmath0-operator and the algebraic bethe ansatz . applying solutions of the inverse scattering problem , we derived determinant representations for form factors of local fermion operators .",
    "in addition , multiple integrals representing the density - density correlation function and the equal - time one - particle green s function were obtained both for arbitrary interaction strengths and particle densities . in particular for the free fermion model ,",
    "these formulae reduce to the known exact results .    before closing this paper",
    ", we would like to remark possible generalizations of our formulae .",
    "a generalization to the finite temperature case is of importance .",
    "in fact , the quantum transfer matrix , which is a powerful tool for study of finite - temperature properties for strongly correlated systems in one - dimension , has already been provided for the spinless fermion model @xcite . because the algebraic relations among the elements of monodromy operators in the quantum transfer matrix approach are completely the same as , the relations derived in this paper are applicable without essential changes .",
    "it will also be very interesting to compute the spectral function for the spinless fermion model .",
    "considering several excited states and inserting the corresponding bethe roots into the determinant representations for the form factors and the scalar product , one can explicitly compute the spectral function for a finite system . the method developed in the study of the dynamical structure factors for the xxz chain",
    "( see @xcite for example ) will also be useful in computations of the spectral function of the spinless fermion model .",
    "comparison with the arguments in @xcite is also interesting .",
