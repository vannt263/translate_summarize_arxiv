    "planetesimal formation in the solar nebula is one of unresolved issues in the theory of planetary formation . in the solar nebula , micron - sized dust particles which float uniformly at first",
    "are considered to stick each other by non - gravitational forces ( e.g. , the van der waals force ) to form dust aggregates .",
    "if the solar nebula is laminar , the dust aggregates settle toward the midplane , and simultaneously they stick each other by collisions due to differential settling velocities .",
    "thus , a thin dust layer is formed around the midplane . the dust density around the midplane increases gradually due to the dust settling . when the dust self - gravity exceeds the tidal force of the central star , that is , the density exceeds the critical density @xmath0 , the dust layer becomes gravitationally unstable and fragments into a lot of km - sized planetesimals ( safronov 1969 , goldreich and ward 1973 , coradini _",
    "_ 1981 , sekiya 1983 ) .",
    "formerly the above mentioned gravitational instability model was considered to be the most promising process of planetesimal formation .    however , if the solar nebula is turbulent , dust aggregates are stirred up , and it may be difficult for the dust density to exceed the critical density of the gravitational instability .",
    "several causes of turbulence in the solar nebula have been proposed : the thermal convection ( lin and papaloizou 1980 , cabot _ et al .",
    "_ 1987a , b , ruden _ et al .",
    "_ 1988 ) , the hydrodynamic instability due to radial shear in the disk ( papaloizou and pringle 1984 , goldreich and narayan 1985 , narayan _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 , nakagawa and sekiya 1992 , sekiya _",
    "1993 ) , and the magneto - rotational instability ( balbus and hawley 1991 ) , and so on .",
    "this work concentrates on investigating the instability due to vertical shear in the dust layer , which arises by the dust settling itself as explained in the following . if the drag force did not work",
    ", dust aggregates would revolve with the kepler velocity balancing the centrifugal force and the gravitational force of a central star . on the other hand ,",
    "a gas fluid would revolve slightly slower than the kepler velocity because only gas is partially supported by a gas pressure gradient .",
    "thus , when gas and dust drag each other , their velocities depend on the dust to gas mass ratio and the frictional time .",
    "in particular , when the frictional time is much shorter than a kepler period , namely that dust aggregate is small and/or fluffy , a dust aggregate and gas fluid move approximately with a same velocity .",
    "then , the revolution velocity @xmath1 in the co - ordinate system which moves with the local kepler velocity @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the total fluid density defined by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the gas density and @xmath7 is the dust density .",
    "the non - dimensional parameter @xmath8 represents the effect of the radial pressure gradient : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distance from the rotation axis of the disk and @xmath11 is the gas pressure ( adachi _ et al .",
    "_ 1976 , weidenschilling 1977 , nakagawa _ et al .",
    "_ 1986 , sekiya 1998 ) .",
    "this vertical shear may cause the shear instability , which may develop turbulence in the dust layer ; thus dust aggregates may be stirred up and dust density may not exceed the critical density of the gravitational instability ( weidenschilling 1980 ) .",
    "cuzzi _ et al . _",
    "( 1993 ) have performed numerical simulations of two fluids , gas and dust , in order to examine whether the above mentioned turbulence is strong enough to prevent the gravitational instability of the dust layer .",
    "they assumed single - sized compact aggregates ( 10 cm or 60 cm ) .",
    "they obtained the quasi - equilibrium density distributions balancing the turbulent diffusion and the settling of aggregates .",
    "they showed that the density does not reach the critical density of the gravitational instability .",
    "( 1995 ) extended this model to multi - fluids where different sized dust aggregates existed in the gas .",
    "( 1999 ) made calculations including the dissipation due to the friction between dust aggregates and the gas .",
    "the results of these papers are almost same as cuzzi _",
    "the parameters used in the turbulence model of these papers were estimated from the laboratory experiments without the density stratification and the effects of the coriolis and the tidal forces .",
    "sekiya ( 1998 ) obtained the quasi - equilibrium distributions of dust density , including the effect of the density stratification , but neglecting the effects of the coriolis and the tidal forces .",
    "the vertical shear rate @xmath12 increases as dust aggregates settle toward the midplane , where @xmath13 is the distance from the midplane . eventually , the shear rate exceeds the critical value of the shear instability , _",
    "i.e. , _ the richardson number becomes less than 0.25 .",
    "the richardson number is defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the vertical gravitational acceleration . then turbulence may be developed .",
    "if dust aggregates are small enough , very weak turbulence can stir up the dust aggregates and prevent them from settling further .",
    "thus , the dust density distribution regulates itself so that the shear rate is marginally above the critical value @xmath16 .",
    "sekiya ( 1998 ) calculated analytically this density distribution with the critical shear rate .",
    "he has concluded that the dust density hardly exceeds the critical density of the gravitational instability , as long as the dust to gas mass ratio inferred from the solar abundance is assumed .",
    "he has shown that if the dust to gas mass ratio increases one order of magnitude by gas escape or dust concentration , the dust density at the midplane exceeds the critical value of the shear instability , and planetesimal can be formed through gravitational fragmentation of the dust layer .",
    "youdin and shu ( 2002 ) also found the critical ratio of the surface density ratio of dust and gas using the density distribution with the critical shear rate .",
    "in addition , they suggested a dust concentration mechanism through radial drift of chondrule - sized dust by gas drag in the nebula .",
    "this mechanism enables the density ratio of dust and gas to exceed the critical value in @xmath17 few @xmath18 year .",
    "the derivation of dust density distribution by sekiya ( 1998 ) , and youdin and shu ( 2002 ) was somewhat intuitive .",
    "more elaborate calculations of the shear instability are needed in order to conclude that the gravitational instability model of planetesimal formation is denied .",
    "for the first step , sekiya and ishitsu ( 2000 , 2001 ) ( hereafter papers i and ii ) investigated the shear instability of the dust layer using the linear analysis , neglecting the effects of the coriolis and the tidal forces .    in paper",
    "i , we assumed that the unperturbed density had the constant richardson number density distributions by sekiya ( 1998 ) .",
    "the results show : ( a ) the flow is stable for the richardson number @xmath19 .",
    "( b ) the growth time of the shear instability is much longer than the kepler period , as long as the richardson number @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    ", the coriolis and the tidal forces would affect the flow in time scale on the order of the kepler period .",
    "thus the neglect of these forces is not good for the constant richardson number density distribution with @xmath20 .    in paper ii",
    ", the linear stability analysis was performed using the following density distribution which will be called the _ hybrid density distribution _ ( an inner constant density distribution , plus outer sinusoidal transition regions ) : @xmath21\\}/2 &   \\mbox{for $ z_d-2h_d<|z|<z_d$ , } \\\\ 0 & \\mbox{for $ z_d\\le |z|$ } , \\end{array } \\right .",

    "the half - thickness of the dust layer is given by @xmath25 and the surface density of the dust is given by @xmath26 where @xmath7 is the dust density defined by the total dust mass floating in a unit volume , and @xmath27 is a parameter ( @xmath28 for the hayashi model ) .",
    "we used hayashi s solar nebula model ( hayashi 1981 , hayashi _ et al .",
    "_ , 1985 ) at 1au as the dust surface density @xmath29 in the most of calculations except for figs .",
    "[ fig : fd ] , [ fig : tfig15 ] , and [ fig : tfig16 ] .    in the following ,",
    "we explain the reason why the hybrid density distribution is used .",
    "dust particles which are distributed uniformly at first stick together to form dust aggregates . in a laminar nebula ,",
    "the settling velocity @xmath30 of a dust aggregate is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the frictional time of the dust aggregate .",
    "dust aggregates grow faster in regions with larger @xmath33 , since the principal relative velocity of dust aggregates is induced by difference of settling velocities of dust aggregates with different frictional times ( weidenschilling 1980 , nakagawa _ et al .",
    "as dust aggregates grow , their settling velocities increase if the dust aggregates are compact .",
    "thus , dust aggregates accumulate in a certain region with an intermediate value of @xmath33 ( see 1000 yrs and 1300 yrs density distribution in fig . 2 of nakagawa _ et al . _ ( 1981 ) ) .",
    "this state is unstable for the rayleigh - taylor instability , and the dust density distribution is considered to be adjusted as to be constant in the dust layer ( watanabe and yamada 2000 ) .",
    "thus , the constant distribution in the dust layer as given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho0 ] ) for @xmath34 is considered to be a natural consequence of the dust settling in a laminar disk . for simplicity",
    ", the sinusoidal density distribution is assumed in the transition region ( @xmath35 ) .    according to results of paper",
    "ii , if @xmath36 , the growth rate of the instability is on the order of the keplerian angular frequency . on the other hand , if @xmath37 , the growth rate is much larger than the keplerian angular frequency .",
    "thus , we have expected that the coriolis and tidal forces might not have an important effect as long as @xmath37 .",
    "ishitsu and sekiya ( 2002 ) ( hereafter paper iii ) , carried out calculations taking the coriolis force into account , but neglecting the tidal force .",
    "the results showed that the coriolis force had little effects .",
    "however , we found a new type of resonances which resembles the lindbland resonances if the growth rate is similar to or smaller than the keplerian angular frequency .",
    "the energy source of the instability is this resonance and different from that of the shear instability .",
    "these results will be reviewed in section 4 .    in this paper",
    ", we solve linearized perturbation equations with the tidal and the coriolis forces under the following assumptions : ( 1 ) the self - gravity is neglected . ( 2 ) a mixture of gas and dust is treated as one fluid , which is a good approximation in the case where dust aggregate sizes are small ( @xmath38 1 cm ) .",
    "( 3 ) the gas is incompressible since the dust layer which is much less than vertical scale height of the gas disk @xmath39 is treated . ( 4 ) the effects of the radial density and the pressure gradient of the unperturbed state are only incorporated in the unperturbed rotation velocity distribution @xmath40 .",
    "( 5 ) local cartesian coordinates ( @xmath41 ) are used and we neglect the curvature of a circle with constant values of @xmath10 and @xmath13 .",
    "( 6 ) the hybrid dust density distribution used in papers ii and iii is adopted as the unperturbed dust density distribution .",
    "when the dust layer with the hybrid dust density distribution becomes unstable for a linear perturbation , the linear mode grows .",
    "eventually , nonlinear effects become important , and a quasi - equilibrium state between settling and turbulent diffusion of dust aggregates would be realized .",
    "this paper treats the first linear growth of the instability .",
    "of course , it is very important to obtain quasi - equilibrium state with taking account of the coriolis and the tidal forces , which is left in future works .",

    "[ fig : tfig3 ] and [ fig : tfig11 ] ) , although the oscillation for @xmath59 seems different from that for @xmath60 at the early phase due to relicts of initial conditions .",

    "the results of the previous section show that the peak growth rate of the instability for @xmath189 is much larger than the case @xmath190 as long as the effect of the tidal force is not taken into account , _ i.e. _ @xmath60 ( see fig . [ fig : dcfig2 ] ) .",
    "figures [ fig : hdpe ] and [ fig : hdgr ] show the time evolutions of components of energy and the growth rate , respectively . reflecting analytical results in the case of @xmath60 ,",

    "a bold solid curve denotes the richardson number distribution .",
    "the vertical velocity @xmath194 is omitted because it is of two orders smaller than @xmath195 and @xmath196 ( see fig [ fig : hdpe ] ) .",

    "[ fig : dcfig4 ] for @xmath60 , a small initial growth rate of the instability is also expected for a large value of @xmath146 .",

    "this growth rate rises at first and then begins to vibrate , like the case where @xmath190 and @xmath199 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : dcfig2 ] , the growth rate in the case @xmath60 is obviously very large when dust settling proceeds and @xmath200 .",
    "we calculated numerically the time evolutions in the cases @xmath201 with @xmath59 , @xmath202 and @xmath162 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tfig9 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath201 , we found @xmath203 for @xmath60 , and then we have @xmath204 from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : crit ] ) .",
    "the estimated value of the time for stabilization is displayed by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : tfig9 ] , which is consistent with the stabilization time of the numerical solution . during several keplerian periods , the perturbed kinetic energy increases by more than 100 orders for @xmath202 in this linear calculation in the case @xmath201 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tfig10 ] ) .",
    "our results indicate that the perturbation increases sufficiently , so that the nonlinear effect would be important , before the mode is stabilized .",
    "thus , the tidal force is effective only in early phase of the dust settling where @xmath205 .",
    "the shear instability eventually grows to nonlinear phase when @xmath167 becomes on the order of @xmath206 by the dust settling as long as @xmath207 ( @xmath208 the dust - gas surface density ratio is given by the solar elemental abundance ) .",
    "last , we consider the case where @xmath209 and @xmath210 to see the dependency of the shear instability on @xmath27 , that is , the dust surface density enhancement relative to that the solar abundance ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : tfig15 ] and [ fig : tfig16 ] ) .",
    "the shear instability is stabilized before the perturbed kinetic energy grows largely in this case . according to results without the tidal force , the peak growth rate in this case is about a kepler frequency and comparable to that in the case with @xmath211 and @xmath28 ( compare fig . [",
    "fig : dcfig2 ] and [ fig : fd ] ) . thus , even though @xmath212 increases , the shear instability is stabilized and planetesimals can be formed by the gravitational instability if dust concentrates to some regions in the solar nebula .    as stated in ",
    "iv , decrease of @xmath84 is idntical to increase of @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that the local dissipation of gas also causes stabilization of the shear instability .",
    "the linear stability analysis of the dust layer in the solar nebula is done including the effects of both the coriolis and the tidal forces .",
    "the hybrid density distribution of the dust is assumed where the dust density is constant in the dust layer and the transition region has a sinusoidal density distribution . the calculations with both the coriolis and the tidal forces show that the tidal force has a stabilizing effect .",
    "the tidal force causes the radial shear in the disk .",
    "this radial shear changes the radial wave number of the mode which is at first unstable , and the mode is eventually stabilized .",
    "thus the behavior of a mode is divided into two stages : ( 1 ) the first growth of the unstable mode which is similar to the results without the tidal force , and ( 2 ) the subsequent stabilization due to an increase of the radial wave number by the radial shear . if @xmath213 , the stabilization occurs before the unstable mode grows largely . on the other hand",
    ", the mode grows more than hundreds orders of magnitude , if @xmath214 .",
    "since @xmath215 is much larger than 20 , the linear hydrodynamic instability calculated in this paper grows largely before dust settling proceeds enough for the dust layer to be gravitationally unstable .",
    "if this instability develops turbulence in the transition region between the dust layer and the gas layer , the overshoot of the turbulence would widen the transition region , and the transition region would be stabilized , because the growth rate of the shear instability decreases as the half - thickness of the transition region increases . then",
    ", the dust aggregates settle further , and the transition region becomes unstable again .",
    "repeats of this cycle would eventually lead the whole of the dust layer to be a quasi - equilibrium state where the dust settling and turbulent diffusion balance each other .",
    "note that this equilibrium state is not necessarily given by @xmath216=constant distribution derived by sekiya ( 1998 ) , because the constant @xmath216 distribution is derived by neglecting the effects of the coriolis and tidal forces .",
    "if this equilibrium state is realized before the density exceeds the critical density of the gravitational instability , planetesimals can not be formed by the gravitational instability .",
    "further nonlinear calculations on the evolution of the dust layer should be done in the future in order to see whether turbulence really develops and an equilibrium state is realized .",
    "we have assumed that the surface density distribution is given by the hayashi model ( _ i.e. _ @xmath217 , @xmath85 ) for most parts of calculations in this paper .",
    "our results show that the shear instability is stabilized by the tidal force if the ratio of the dust surface density @xmath29 to the gas surface density @xmath82 is hundreds times as large as that calculated from the solar elemental abundance , even if @xmath218 .",
    "the shear - induced instability does not grow largely when the dust density reaches the critical density of the gravitational instability in this linear calculation if dust concentrates to some locations , or gas dissipates from the nebula .",
    "for example , dust concentration due to radial migration induced by the gas drag in the laminar disk could increase the dust to gas mass ratio ( youdin and shu 2002 ) .",
    "then the planetesimal formation due to gravitational instability may occur . in this case , the effect of the self - gravity , e.g. midplane cusp of the vertical density distribution ( sekiya 1998 , youdin and shu 2002 ) should be taken into account .",
    "lastly , we discuss the dust concentration by eddies in a protoplanetary disk .",
    "( 2001 ) assumed a turbulent disk and showed that the dust concentrates to preferential positions between eddies , even if the dust aggregates are as small as 1 mm . in their analysis ,",
    "the effects of the solar gravity are not included . if dust concentrated to some positions , they revolve around the central star with the keplerian velocity .",
    "on the other hand , the residual gas rich parts revolve with smaller mean velocity due to the radial pressure gradient .",
    "thus , the dust aggregates may be removed from the preferential positions between eddies and the concentration may be suppressed .",
    "there are also models of dust concentration by large eddies .",
    "klahr and henning ( 1997 ) assumed large scale eddies whose rotation axis are parallel to the midplane .",
    "they showed that dust concentration away from the midplane . on the other hand ,",
    "another  vortex capture \" model ( barge and sommeria 1995 , tanga _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , godon and livio 1999 , 2000 , chavanis 2000 , de la fuente marcos and barge 2001 ) assumes eddies whose rotational axis is parallel to the rotation axis of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "these eddies preferentially concentrate dust aggregates which have stopping time due to gas drag on the order of the keplerian period .",
    "these models give an additional possibility to reach the gravitational instability .",
    "however , it is not clear what kind of eddies are really probable in the protoplanetary disks .",
    "full hydrodynamic simulation including interactions between gas and dust and the solar gravity should be performed in future to elucidate whether the dust concentration by eddies really occurs in the protoplanetary disks .",
