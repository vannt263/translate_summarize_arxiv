    "one of the oldest problems in quantum physics is also conceptually the simplest .",
    "how does one calculate the quantum dynamical time evolution of many - body or strongly interacting systems ? in this paper",
    ", we will treat some recent progress towards solving this problem .",
    "this uses a novel technique of stochastic gauge fields .",
    "we will focus here on a relatively simple example , which allows us to compare numerical results with an exact solution .",
    "the present results show dramatic improvements in sampling error compared to the previous positive - p @xcite distribution methods .",
    "the chief difficulty in many - body quantum dynamics , is that the relevant hilbert space of all but the most trivial cases is typically enormous .",
    "for example , the formation of a small bose - einstein condensate @xcite may easily involve @xmath0 atoms with @xmath1 modes , giving @xmath2 participating quantum states .",
    "similar problems also occur in the static calculation of many - body ground states and thermal equilibrium ensembles .",
    "these problems have been solved by the use of methods called quantum monte - carlo techniques @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that the difficulty of a large hilbert space is exactly the same in both the dynamic and static calculations .",
    "thus , we have to conclude that dimensionality is not an insuperable barrier .",
    "the main technique treated here is a class of stochastic methods which sample the hilbert space , rather than storing every element of a quantum dynamical problem .",
    "provided sampling errors can be controlled , there is no reason why stochastic methods should nt be used for quantum dynamics , just as they are in qmc @xcite methods used for calculating ground - state or thermal equilibrium properties .",
    "we present methods that are a great improvement on the previously used positive - p simulation method @xcite , which is most useful for open systems coupled to damping reservoirs . in comparison to an earlier approach of modifying the noise terms dynamically @xcite",
    ", we focus on methods that allow the drift terms responsible for the deterministic evolution , to be changed .",
    "the approach used here is to expand the quantum density matrix using non - orthogonal coherent state projection operators , together with a phase term .",
    "this allows a choice of time - evolution equations to be made in a way that minimizes the phase - oscillations that would otherwise occur in a direct path - integral approach , while still preventing the phase - space oscillations that can occur in the positive - p method .",
    "a very successful method for time - domain simulations of damped quantum systems is the positive p - representation used in quantum optics . in this method",
    ", the quantum state is expanded using non - orthogonal coherent states .",
    "this allows multi - boson and multi - mode interacting quantum systems to be simulated as stochastic processes in the time - domain .",
    "these methods have been applied to quantum solitons @xcite , bec phase fluctuations @xcite , and to the theory of evaporative cooling @xcite  where the theory correctly reproduces the formation of a bec , as observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "however , the positive p - representation usually has large sampling errors for times after the bec has condensed .",
    "this is typical for this method , which is most effective for open systems coupled to reservoirs .",
    "for this reason , the remainder of the research presented here has been into methods of minimizing the sampling error for a very simplified , one - mode version of the bec hamiltonian : @xmath3 here @xmath4 is the creation operator for a single mode of the boson field , with a positive scattering length constant .",
    "the exact solutions for some observables can be found directly for this simple case , which is clearly very helpful while investigating errors .",
    "we will focus on the evolution of the y - quadrature observable : , given an initial coherent state .",
    "the positive - p expansion of the density matrix @xmath5 uses a kernel of non - hermitian coherent - state projection operators . instead , consider a p - like distribution with a hermitian kernel : @xmath6 with kernel : @xmath7=2e^{n_{r}}\\cos ( \\theta + n_{i}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here",
    ", @xmath8 is an un - normalized coherent state , @xmath9 is a real variable representing a quantum phase , and @xmath10 .",
    "any state can be represented with a positive hermitian p - distribution , and expectation values of an observable like @xmath11 can be calculated according to averages over @xmath12 .",
    "for example , in the one - mode case , if the initial condition is a coherent state with @xmath13 , then we expect that : @xmath14}/ {    \\mbox{tr}[\\widehat{\\lambda } ] } \\right > _ { \\mbox{traj.}}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\mbox{im } \\left(\\alpha_0 \\exp\\left[|\\alpha_0|^2(e^{-it } -1)-it/2\\right]\\right ) \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "let us now apply the hermitian p - distribution to the case of the anharmonic oscillator . the master equation is @xmath15.\\ ] ]",
    "the next step is to note that there are a number of operator identities between terms in the hamiltonian and differential operations on the kernel .",
    "the ones of interest for this system are @xmath16 and its adjoint . by using this identity ,",
    "it is possible to transform the operator equation into a corresponding fokker - planck equation for @xmath17 .",
    "first , we change to the more convenient variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 defined by : @xmath20 , \\vspace{0.3cm}\\\\ \\beta   & = & \\exp \\left [ \\displaystyle\\left ( \\frac{1-i}{2}\\right ) \\psi \\right ] \\,.\\end{array}\\ ] ]    to take advantage of the new phase variable @xmath9 , consider that the hermitian p - distribution kernel @xmath21 also obeys a number of additional differential identities in @xmath9 . in particular : @xmath22 since these are equal to zero , any multiple of them can be added to the master equation with no effect , so we have multiplied them by the completely arbitrary functions @xmath23 , which can be dependent on @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in the fokker - planck equation formalism , these become correspondences for _",
    "zero_. for example , defining @xmath26 we have : @xmath27 ( e^{2}p).\\ ] ] these correspondences can be added in any amount without disturbing the dynamics , as long as the boundary terms from partial integration vanish @xcite .",
    "we now wish to convert the fokker - planck equation to stochastic langevin equations . to do this",
    ", the diffusion must be positive , and hence we choose : @xmath28 .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath29 , and to introduce the functions @xmath30 and @xmath31@xmath32;\\vspace{0.3cm}\\\\ \\bar{g}&=&\\bar{f}+\\frac{1}{2}[n_{i}+n_{r } ] \\ , .\\end{array}\\ ] ] when these are zero the equations are identical to those obtained using the positive p - distribution . converting the differential equation in @xmath17 to ito stochastic equations ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath33 dt+\\sqrt{2}dw,\\nonumber \\\\ d\\psi   & = & \\left [ { n}^{*}(1-i)-2\\bar{g}(t - i)\\right ] dt+\\sqrt{2}d\\bar{w } ,   \\\\",
    "d\\tilde{\\theta } & = & -2t\\left [ g^{2}+\\bar{g}^{2}\\right ] dt+\\sqrt{2}\\left ( \\bar{g}d\\bar{w}-gdw\\right ) .\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the noises @xmath34 and @xmath35 are random , gaussian , mutually uncorrelated , and uncorrelated for different times , with variance @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath37 and @xmath38 are _ completely arbitrary _ , they can be used to tailor the equations to our liking , without changing the final results .",
    "this is akin to what is done with electromagnetic gauges , which is why we refer to the @xmath37 s as itstochastic gauges .",
    "a suitable gauge , with a free parameter @xmath39 is as follows : @xmath40,\\nonumber \\\\ \\bar{g}=\\frac{\\mu}{2}[n_{i}+n_{r}-|\\beta |^{2 } ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the results of simulating the one - mode anharmonic oscillator with this gauge ( with two different values of @xmath39 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ yfig ] , together with the positive p results .",
    "it can be seen that the sampling error in the quadratures has been contained and reduced by _ over twenty orders of magnitude ! _    closer inspection of fig .",
    "[ yfig ] , reveals that the simulated expectation value of the @xmath11 quadrature , does not quite match the analytically predicted value for @xmath41 for large times .",
    "this systematic error is due to non - vanishing boundary terms in the @xmath42 variable , making the change from master to fokker - planck equations inexact .",
    "the discrepancy can be reduced by using the optimized gauge with @xmath43 , given by the solid line , although the sampling error increases .",
    "it is clear that further investigation into the trade - offs between reducing sampling error and reducing boundary term error is required .",
    "the successful control and immense reduction of sampling error in the above one - mode example gives us confidence that the sampling error in the many - mode calculation can also be reduced using this method , and bec s can be simulated after the point of condensation reached in   @xcite .",
    "the particular realization of the stochastic gauge idea discussed above is aimed toward the simulation of a bec .",
    "however the approach is quite general , and may also be fruitful for simulations of many - mode higher dimensional bosonic systems .      m. h. anderson , j. r. ensher , c. e. wieman and e. a. cornell , science 269 , 198 ( 1995 ) ; c. c. bradley , c. a. sackett , j. j. tollett , and r. g. hulet , phys .",
