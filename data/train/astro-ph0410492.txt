    "pq and was discovered by mcadam on 21 march 1988 @xcite at a visual magnitude of 10 .",
    "examination of the palomar sky survey plates showed a precursor object with a blue magnitude between 18 - 19 and a red magnitude of about 20 @xcite . within 19 days",
    "the light curve had declined by 2 magnitudes .",
    "the large outburst amplitude and rapid decline led to the initial classification of a classical nova but spectra taken 3.5 months after the outburst by @xcite lacked the nebular features typically observed in classical novae .",
    "instead , the spectra had strong balmer emission surrounded by broad absorption similar to the quiesent spectra of the dwarf nova wz sge .",
    "the strong absorption indicated that the energy distribution was primarily from the white dwarf ( wd ) and implied an extremely low accretion rate .",
    "recently , it has been shown that systems with this type of spectra are good candidates for containing non - radially pulsating da wds or zz cet stars @xcite .",
    "wz sge is a dwarf nova whose outbursts occur on timescales of tens of years and with amplitudes of 7 - 8 magnitudes",
    ". cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) of this type are also known as toads or tremendous outburst amplitude dwarf novae @xcite .",
    "these characteristics are thought to be due to the very close binary separation and the extremely low accretion rate in these systems .",
    "toad orbital periods are all below the period gap and are typically of order 90 minutes .",
    "the mass transfer rates implied by the models are only 10@xmath1m@xmath2 yr@xmath3 @xcite .    given pq and s similarities to a dwarf nova",
    ", @xcite searched archival plates for evidence of previous outbursts .",
    "two other outbursts with maximum magnitudes of @xmath4 11 were found on 23 august 1938 and 7 march 1967 . with decades",
    "long superoutburst timescales , an outburst amplitude of @xmath4 9 mag , and a wz sge like quiescent spectrum , pq and clearly has toad characteristics . in this paper",
    "we show that the orbital period _ appears to be _ below the period gap and that the system likely contains a wd in the instability strip .",
    "we obtained 10 spectra of pq and on the 6.5 m multiple mirror telescope ( mmt ) on 16 september 2003 .",
    "we used the blue channel ccd spectrograph with a 500 grooves per millimeter grating and a 1   wide slit for a spectral resolution of 3.6 .",
    "spectral coverage extends from 4100  to 7200 .",
    "the exposure time was set to 480 seconds in order to resolve an orbital period as low as 80 minutes .",
    "the seeing ranged from 10 - 15 during the night .",
    "biases and flat fields were obtained at the beginning and end of each night and a henear comparison lamp spectrum was obtained after each pq and observation for optimum wavelength calibration .",
    "standard stars were also observed throughout the night for flux calibration .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard iraf routines .",
    "the combined spectrum is shown in figure [ modelfit ] ) = 0.06 , none of the spectra shown in this paper have been dereddened nor have they been doppler corrected . ] .",
    "the combined spectrum has narrow emission lines flanked by broad absorption similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "the equivalent widths , fluxes , and fwzi values of the observed emission lines in the combined spectrum are given in table [ tab : emission ] .",
    "all the emission lines have a red and a blue component whose strength and peak vary with time .",
    "the evolution of these components can best be seen in h@xmath0 and is shown in figure [ evolve ] .",
    "radial velocities from the line wings were measured by convolving the line profiles with a pair of gaussian bandpasses ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) whose width is set to the resolution and whose separation is varied . for each separation , the velocities are fit to a sine function of the form @xmath5\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the systemic velocity , k is the semiamplitude , and @xmath7 is the offset from superior conjunction of the wd . the best solution is chosen as the one producing the smallest errors in the individual parameters and the total @xmath8 of the fit .",
    "we fit both the h@xmath0 and h@xmath9 lines with this method but unfortunately not all the observed line profiles were useful .",
    "two h@xmath0 and one h@xmath9 profiles were discarded due to cosmic rays or noise at a particular separation .",
    "even with one less data point the h@xmath0 fit was significantly better than that determined for h@xmath9 thus we adopt the h@xmath0 separation and period as the best solution and force h@xmath9 to match .",
    "the best fit period is 1.7@xmath100.1 hours where this is the formal uncertainty from the analysis .",
    "the true uncertainty in the period is greater since the derived period is longer than the sampling time .",
    "figure [ radvel ] shows the radial velocity data for h@xmath0 and h@xmath9 fits .",
    "the radial velocity data is provided in table [ tab : rv ] .",
    "the orbital parameters of the lowest total @xmath8 fit are given in table [ tab : parms ] along with other parameters of pq and .",
    "to quantify the component changes , we calculated the ratio of the blue ( violet ) to red components ( v / r ) for each spectrum that shows h@xmath0 .",
    "the v / r ratios were calculated with the iraf program splot with two gaussians which had the same fwhm and were centered at 6554and 6574 . in each spectrum",
    "the gaussians were only allowed a single wavelength shift provided that the separation was always 20 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ ratio ] .",
    "superior conjunction of the wd is defined as the red to blue crossing point of the emission lines . in figure",
    "[ ratio ] we have fit the v / r data with a sine wave of the form : @xmath11\\ ] ] to determine the crossing point .",
    "with p@xmath12 = 1.7 hours the best fit gives a superior conjunction date of hjd 2,452,898.902 .",
    "the other model parameters are provided in table [ tab : parms ] .      as an added check on the derived period we utilized differential photometry of pq and from a cv orbital period survey taken in early 1999 .",
    "the data were obtained at the steward observatory 1.6 m kuiper telescope on mount bigalow with the 2k@xmath132k back - illuminated ccd imager .",
    "the ccd was set at 2@xmath132 binning giving an image scale of 0.3@xmath14/pixel .",
    "the seeing varied during the run between 1@xmath14  and 2@xmath14 .",
    "the observations were carried out in the @xmath15 band where the accretion disk and secondary star are typically of comparable brightness .",
    "the exposure time in the pq and field was 600 seconds .",
    "biases and flats were taken at the beginning and end of each night and the data were reduced in iraf . the only night that we spent sufficient time to confirm a 1.7 hour period was 19 january 1999 . on that night pq and was observed 18 times over 3 hours .",
    "a differential light curve of the results is shown in figure [ lightcurve ] .",
    "the observed changes are suggestive of a variation similar to our derived spectroscopic period .",
    "the normalized periodogram @xcite of the photometry gives a longer period of 2.1 hours but at a low confidence level of only 50% .",
    "we emphasize that these are not definitive orbital period solutions since the derived periods are similar in length to the total time that pq and was observed .",
    "more data are necessary to reach a more definitive orbital period for this object .",
    "however , the fact that the radial velocities and the changes in the blue and red components show sine wave like behavior on the timescale of our observation runs imply that the period must be short .",
    "a firm upper limit on the orbital period can be established since the accretion disk would overwhelm the wd at periods @xmath16 3 hours and there are no known dwarf novae in the gap .",
    "thus for the remainder of the paper we will assume an orbital period range between 1.7 and 2.1 hours .",
    "the wd effective temperature and gravity were determined by comparing the observed spectrum to a grid of synthetic spectra computed using the phoenix model atmosphere code .",
    "details of the modeling can be found in @xcite .",
    "the grid includes models with @xmath17 = 9,000k  15,000k ( in steps of 1000k ) , @xmath18 = 6.5 , 7.0 , 7.5 , 8.0 , and 10@xmath3 , 10@xmath19 and solar metallicities . after masking the balmer emission lines due to the accretion disk , @xmath17",
    "was first determined using least - squares minimization across the full observed spectral range .",
    "fixing @xmath17 , the surface gravity was found by fitting only the wings of h@xmath20 , h@xmath6 , and h@xmath9 since these were the only features available that are reasonably sensitive to gravity .",
    "the models with sub - solar metallicities gave only marginally better fits ; however , models with solar metallicities indicate that several metal absorption lines should have been detected but clearly were not observed .",
    "consequently , the metallicity is likely less than 10@xmath3 solar .",
    "overall , varying metallicity had little effect on the final @xmath17 and @xmath18 values .",
    "the final best - fitting model had @xmath17 = 12,000k @xmath10 1000k and @xmath18 = 7.7 @xmath10 0.3 ( cgs units ) with 10@xmath19 solar metallicity .",
    "estimates for the wd mass and radius were found by using theoretical cooling tracks on a @xmath17  @xmath18 plane @xcite .",
    "figure [ wdplot ] shows that the best fit @xmath17 and @xmath18 values give @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "note that this is only a mass estimate since the wds in cvs are heated by accretion .",
    "the wd in pq and might not follow this exactly",
    ".    there was residual flux red - ward of 6000  between the observed and the best fit wd model spectra .",
    "this red excess is from the secondary . to improve the model fit , a synthetic spectrum of an m dwarf",
    "was added to the best - fitting wd synthetic spectrum .",
    "since the secondary in cvs fill their roche lobe , their characteristics are determined by the properties of the binary system .",
    "equation 2.101 in @xcite , @xmath23 relates the orbital period and secondary radius . applying this equation to our derived periods gives a range of @xmath24 .",
    "the best fit effective temperature of the secondary from visual inspection was 2500 k , however , this should not be taken as definitive since the uncertainty is easily @xmath10 500 k. even this range and the short orbital period still imply a late m dwarf as the secondary star .",
    "the best fit wd plus secondary model spectral energy distribution is shown in figure [ modelfit ] .",
    "an attempt was made to extract the secondary spectrum by subtracting the best - fitting wd synthetic spectrum from the observed spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting spectrum was too noisy and did not cover enough of the tio and vo bands to make a reliable determination of the spectral type .",
    "the only reported infrared color for pq and , ( @xmath25 ) = 0.85@xmath100.49 @xcite , is consistent within the uncertainty with a late m spectral type .",
    "pq and is too faint have been detected by the 2mass survey @xcite .",
    "the mass equation , equation 2.100 in @xcite , @xmath26 is valid for p@xmath12 between 1.3 and 9 hours and provides a secondary mass range of 0.13 - 0.16 m@xmath2 for periods between 1.7 and 2.1 hours . given the derived wd mass the binary system mass ratio , @xmath27 , is 0.28 - 0.34 .",
    "using the derived wd radius , an absolute magnitude was computed for the best - fitting wd synthetic spectrum ; m@xmath28 = 11.2 . with an apparent magnitude , m@xmath28 = 19 @xcite and e(b - v ) = 0.06 , the distance to pq and",
    "was found to be @xmath29 pc .",
    "this distance places pq and 110 pc below the galactic plane .",
    "the only other distance estimate in the literature is from @xcite .",
    "they use the observed @xmath30 band magnitude to determine the absolute magnitudes .",
    "their method depends on knowledge of the secondary s size and its fractional contribution to the @xmath30 band flux . without",
    "any period information @xcite obtained a large range in distance for pq and by assuming orbital periods between 80 minutes and 6 hours . using their same method but",
    "now with our derived period range gives a distance between 319 - 817 pc .",
    "this estimate is still only an lower limit since it assumes that the secondary contributes 100% of the @xmath30 band flux however it is consistent with the distance from our wd analysis .",
    "the best fit phoenix wd model puts pq and in the region of the zz ceti instability strip @xcite .",
    "the low accretion rate implied by the strong balmer absorption makes pq and an ideal candidate for follow - up observations for non - radial pulsations .",
    "if found , an analysis of the oscillations will provide information on important wd parameters including mass , composition , magnetic field , rotation , temperature , and luminosity @xcite .",
    "gw lib @xcite , sdss j161033.64 - 010223.3 @xcite , sdssj013132.39 - 090122.3 and sdssj220553.98 + 115553.7 @xcite are other wz sge type dwarf novae of similar wd temperature that have already been shown to exhibit non - radial pulsations .",
    "pq and has characteristics similar to wz sge type variable stars .",
    "its quiescent spectra show little indication of an accretion disk implying a low mass transfer rate .",
    "pq and had three known superoutbursts of amplitude @xmath4 9 magnitudes in the 50 years prior to 1988",
    ". fits to spectra give p@xmath12 = 1.7 hours while the period derived from photometry is slightly longer at 2.1 hours .",
    "more observations are required to confirm the true period but the available evidence strongly supports an orbital period below the orbital gap .",
    "the best fit wd model gives t@xmath31 = 12,000 k , log(g ) = 7.7 , and a distance of 330 pc .",
