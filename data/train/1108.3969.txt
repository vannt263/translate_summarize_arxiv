    "recent anomalous measurements of a number of observables at the fermilab tevatron , such as the forward - backward asymmetry in top - quark pair production  @xcite , the like - sign dimuon charge asymmetry in semileptonic @xmath2-hadron decays  @xcite , and the invariant mass distribution of jet pairs produced in association with a  @xmath3  boson  @xcite , give us possible hints on physics beyond the standard model  ( sm ) .",
    "one of the candidates that have been proposed to explain these anomalies is a  massive spin - one electrically neutral gauge particle , the @xmath0 boson , which may be associated with an additional abelian gauge symmetry , u(1)@xmath4 , that is broken at around the tev scale and has a  mass of @xmath5150 gev  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the desired @xmath0 boson would need to have sufficiently sizable flavor - changing neutral - current  ( fcnc ) interactions in the quark sector .",
    "one way to induce @xmath0-mediated fcnc s is to introduce exotic fermions having u(1)@xmath4 charges different from those of the sm fermions  @xcite , as occurs in models with the e@xmath6 grand unified group . in this case , mixing of the right - handed ordinary and exotic quarks , all su(2)@xmath7 singlets , gives rise to fcnc s mediated by a heavy @xmath0 or due to small @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing .",
    "another possibility involves family - nonuniversal interactions of the  @xmath0 . in string - inspired model building , it is natural for at least one of the gauge bosons of the extra u(1 ) groups to possess family - nonuniversal couplings to ordinary fermions  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the fcnc couplings appear when one transforms the sm fermions into their mass eigenstates , without the necessity to introduce new fermion states . furthermore",
    ", both left- and right - handed fermions can have significant flavor - violating interactions with the @xmath0 , as well as small family - nondiagonal couplings to the @xmath1 boson caused by @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing .",
    "in fact , @xmath0 models with tree - level quark fcnc s have been studied extensively in low - energy flavor physics phenomena , such as neutral meson ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , or @xmath10 ) mixing , @xmath10 meson decays involving the @xmath11 transition in particular , and single top production  @xcite . in principle , one can consider the possibility of fcnc s in the lepton sector as well  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we focus on family - nonuniversal interactions of the @xmath0 with the charged leptons and explore constraints on its relevant couplings from various experiments involving only leptons in the initial and final states .",
    "such processes suffer less from qcd corrections and hadronic uncertainties than the above - mentioned hadronic systems .",
    "we assume that the @xmath0 boson arises from an extra u(1 ) gauge symmetry , but otherwise adopt a model - independent approach .",
    "we take into account the effect of @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing , of both kinetic and mass types , which modifies theoretical predictions of the electroweak @xmath12 parameter and various @xmath1-pole observables . due to the family nonuniversality ,",
    "such a  @xmath0 boson would feature flavor - changing leptonic couplings , as would also the @xmath1 boson through the mixing .",
    "we therefore examine a  number of flavor - conserving and flavor - changing processes to evaluate constraints on the leptonic @xmath0 couplings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present the interactions of the @xmath0 boson with the charged leptons in section  [ sec : interactions ] .",

    "the pertinent observables include those in leptonic @xmath1 decays from the @xmath1-pole data and the cross sections of @xmath13 collisions into lepton - antilepton pairs measured at lepii .",
    "we separate the analysis of the flavor - changing couplings into two parts .",
    "the constraints from transitions generated by tree - level diagrams are treated in section  [ sec : flavorchanging ] .",
    "we place upper bounds on the couplings from the rates of flavor - violating @xmath14 decays , @xmath15 , several flavor - violating @xmath16 decays into 3 leptons , muonium - antimuonium conversion , as well as the cross sections of flavor - changing annihilations  @xmath17 .",
    "the constraints from processes induced by loop diagrams are given in section  [ sec : loopflavorchanging ] .",
    "the considered processes or observables are the flavor - changing radiative lepton decays @xmath18 , the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons , and their electric dipole moments .",
    "we will make use of the existing experimental information on all these transitions , including new measurements from the babar , belle , and meg collaborations  @xcite .",
    "based on the allowed coupling ranges , we make predictions for various flavor - conserving and -violating processes in section  [ sec : predictions ] .",
    "these predictions can serve to help guide experimentalists in future searches for @xmath0 signals .",
    "our findings are summarized in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the mass lagrangian for the interaction eigenstates @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the massive neutral gauge bosons after electroweak symmetry breaking , which leaves the photon massless , can be expressed  as @xmath21 where @xmath22 denote the masses of the gauge bosons and @xmath23 represents the mixing between them . as discussed in appendix  [ lag ] ,",

    "one can see from eq.([lint ] ) that the presence of nonzero off - diagonal elements of @xmath57 , due to the nonuniversality of the diagonal elements of @xmath58 and to the charged - lepton mixing , gives rise to flavor - changing couplings of the @xmath0 to the leptons at tree level .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1-@xmath0 mixing introduces not only family nonuniversality , but also flavor violation into the tree - level interactions of  the  @xmath1 .",

    "this translates into @xmath319 the first one of these was also evaluated in ref.@xcite , and their result is roughly similar to ours .",
    "this @xmath320 constraint appears much stricter than the one inferred from eq.([et2 ] ) .",
    "but the comparison is actually less clear here due to the presence of a phase difference between @xmath321 and @xmath322 in the former .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath323 limit is weaker at least by 3 orders of magnitude than that implied by  eq.([mt2 ] ) .",
    "we summarize here the strongest limits on the @xmath0 couplings which we have determined . defining @xmath324 , we have for @xmath69gev @xmath325 while for @xmath123  -  2  tev @xmath326 where all the numbers are in units of  gev@xmath126 .",
    "the @xmath1-pole and lep - ii measurements together have supplied the constraints on the flavor - conserving couplings .",
    "the numbers for the flavor - changing couplings have come from @xmath15 , @xmath327 , and @xmath328 data .",
    "in addition , from @xmath329 @xmath330 complementary to the individual limits on  @xmath331 . based on the results above , we now make predictions for the largest values of a number of observables , including some of those discussed in the preceding two sections .",
    "our results below can serve the purpose of guiding experimentalists in future searches for @xmath0 signals .    with these couplings",
    ", one can obviously get the decay rates of the @xmath0 into a pair of charged leptons , although not their branching ratios , as we have left its couplings to other fermions unspecified . since @xmath332 , for the flavor - conserving modes we seek values of the couplings which maximize the rates , but simultaneously satisfy the @xmath1-pole and lep - ii requirements discussed in section  [ sec : flavorconserving ] . for most of the @xmath0 masses considered , the results can roughly be represented by @xmath333 the exceptions being @xmath334 and @xmath335 in the @xmath69gev case .",
    "for each of the flavor - violating modes , we simply choose the largest of the relevant set of @xmath336 numbers in eqs .",
    "( [ ll1 ] ) and  ( [ ll2 ] ) to arrive at @xmath337 for @xmath69gev and their @xmath123 - 2  tev counterparts with @xmath338 ratios which are about 5 times smaller .",
    "next are the flavor - changing @xmath1-boson decays @xmath339 . since @xmath340 and @xmath341",
    ", we again take for each mode the largest one of @xmath342 from eqs .",
    "( [ ll1 ] ) and  ( [ ll2 ] ) , but employ the maximal values of @xmath62 consistent with the procedure to determine the couplings in  section  [ sec : flavorchanging ] .",
    "thus , we find that the @xmath343 numbers for @xmath69gev yield the largest branching - ratios , namely @xmath344 the latter two predictions are , respectively , only less than 25 times away from the existing limits @xmath345 and @xmath346  @xcite .    turning to the decays of the leptons into 3 lighter leptons , we will address only the modes that we did not use to derive the strictest constraints . for @xmath347 , if the upper bounds on @xmath194 are used and their coefficients in the @xmath185 expression are maximized , the resulting prediction for the branching ratio turn out to exceed its experimental limit .",
    "a similar situation arises in  @xmath348 , as can be deduced from its branching - ratio formula .",
    "consequently , we can not make useful predictions in these cases .",
    "nevertheless , this also means that they may be potential means for probing the  @xmath0 within specific models .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath349 and @xmath350 we obtain @xmath351 which come from the @xmath352 results for @xmath69gev and are much smaller than the current bounds .",
    "the predictions would only double if all the couplings were allowed to contribute at the same time .",
    "hence the @xmath0 effects on these 2 modes are unlikely to be detectable in the near future .",
    "the largest impact of the @xmath0 on the effective coupling parametrizing the muonium - antimuonium conversion is also from the @xmath353 bound for @xmath69gev , @xmath354 far below its experimental counterpart .",
    "accordingly , we expect that this transition is not sensitive to the @xmath0 signal .",
    "since the flavor - violating annihilation @xmath17 depends on the center - of - mass energy , we will only give predictions for @xmath355 at @xmath243gev in the @xmath69gev case to illustrate how sensitive these observables might be to the @xmath0 signals .",
    "thus , searching for the maximal rates , we get @xmath356 these numbers are less than the corresponding measured bounds by about 3 orders of magnitude or more .    for the radiative decays , we deal with the rates of @xmath357 and @xmath358 , as @xmath329 was employed to produce one of the strictest constraints . incorporating eq .",
    "( [ slt ] ) in ( [ l2lg ] ) and dropping the @xmath251 terms , we try to acquire the biggest rates by maximizing the coefficients of @xmath359 in the branching ratios , in a way consistent with the procedure in section  [ sec : flavorchanging ] to extract their upper - limits , and subsequently applying the upper limits , one at a time .",
    "this yields @xmath360 which are close to the current limits @xmath282 and @xmath283  @xcite",

    "we have considered a @xmath0 boson with family - nonuniversal couplings to charged leptons and mixing of kinetic and mass types with the @xmath1 boson . employing current experimental data and taking a  model - independent apporach",

    "such an analysis was done for a @xmath0 mass of 150gev , as inspired by recent tevatron anomalies , as well as higher masses of 0.5 - 2  tev .",
    "we found that the @xmath1-pole and lep - ii measurements together formed the strongest constraints on the flavor - conserving couplings .",
    "the most stringent bounds on the flavor - changing couplings came from the measured upper - limits of the branching ratios of the @xmath361 , @xmath362 , and @xmath328 processes .",
    "the radiative decay @xmath329 supplied complementary information on the flavor - changing @xmath161-@xmath16 and @xmath206-@xmath16 couplings .",
    "we also commented on which conditions would be relaxed if there was no mixing between the  @xmath1 and  @xmath0 .",
    "detailed results are summarized in the beginning of section  [ sec : predictions ] .    with the most restricted of the extracted couplings , we computed the maximum rates of both flavor - conserving and -changing decays of the  @xmath0 into a pair of charged leptons as functions of the @xmath0 mass .",
    "we further predicted the rates of flavor - changing @xmath363 , which are not far below the existing measured bounds .",
    "we found that @xmath185 or @xmath207 are potentially good observables to probe the @xmath0 within specific models .",
    "in contrast , the rates for @xmath364 and @xmath350 were calculated to be too small to detect in the near future .",
    "our predictions for @xmath365 and @xmath366 are both very close to their current experimental limits .",
    "finally , we commented that the @xmath0 boson have relatively less impact on the anomalous magnetic moments and electric dipole moments of the electron and muon because of the stringent constraints on its couplings .",
    "our results could also serve to constrain the rates of other @xmath0-mediated processes involving both quarks and leptons , such as the @xmath367 and @xmath368 decays , that have been of great interest recently .",
    "this would require extending the analysis to the quark sector .",
