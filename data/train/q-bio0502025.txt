    "but an analysis of the influence of this parameter in each model confirms that chemical coupling is overall more efficient than the electrical one in enhancing coherence .",
    "this is evidenced by fig .",
    "[ newfig3](a ) , which plots the minimum coefficient of variation @xmath53 ( _ i.e. _ its value for optimal noise ) versus the coupling coefficient @xmath56 for the two types of coupling in the 2-neuron case .",

    "when choosing the right values of the coupling coefficient that make chemical and electrical coupling comparable , one also needs to take into account the synchronization between the different elements in the array .",
    "this can be accomplished via the average membrane potential @xmath58 over all the array . in the case of perfect synchronization , this quantity will exhibit spikes identical to , and simultaneous with , those of the individual neurons . in the case of partial synchronization , spikes in the average potential ( defined beyond a given threshold , in our case @xmath34  mv ) only occur when a sufficient number of neurons fire within a time window smaller than the spike width .",
    "given these considerations , we determine the interspike interval series of the average potential and compute its statistical properties , namely its mean @xmath49 and its normalized standard deviation @xmath59 .    figure [ newfig3](b ) plots the minimum value of @xmath53 ( for optimal noise ) corresponding to the average potential , for increasing coupling strengths .",
    "on the basis of these results , we can establish that the best choices for coupling strengths are @xmath40  ns for electrical coupling and @xmath60  ns for chemical .",
    "these values are valid not only for two neurons , but for all analyzed system sizes .",
    "we have seen so far that chemical coupling is more effective at enhancing stochastic coherence than electrical coupling .",
    "we now discuss the relationship between array - enhanced coherence and synchronization .",
    "array - enhanced coherence is absent for low levels of synchronization , because in that case every neuron behaves as basically uncoupled from all others , so that no constructive effects of coupling ( such as array - enhanced coherence ) can arise . in the opposite limit ,",
    "large synchronization levels are not useful in promoting coherence either , since in that case the whole system behaves as a single neuron . however , in the intermediate regime of imperfect synchronization , neighboring neurons can `` remind '' each other to spike at the right times ( i.e. , right after the refractory period ) for an optimal noise level , so that coherence is globally enhanced .",
    "this can not happen if the neurons are perfectly synchronized .",
    "we now test the efficiency of the two coupling schemes in leading to synchronization .",
    "we can already expect , from the functional form of the corresponding coupling term , eqs .",
    "( [ syn])-([receptor ] ) , that chemical synapses will never lead to perfect isochronous synchronization in neuronal arrays . to begin with , the dynamics of the fraction @xmath24 of bound receptors introduces a delay in the interneuronal communication that is absent in the electrical coupling case , eq .",
    "( [ linsyn ] ) .",
    "the diffusive form of the latter , furthermore , is compatible with the identical synchronization solution , @xmath61 , whereas this is not so for chemical coupling .    to check the previous hypothesis , fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] compares the mean interspike interval and coefficient of variation of the average potential for the two types of coupling .",
    "this figure should be contrasted with the corresponding results for the local membrane potential , fig .",
    "again , the situation is qualitatively similar in both cases , although there are quantitative differences . the mean time interval between spikes of the average potential increases noticeably for large system sizes ( _ cf _ stars in the top row of fig .  [ fig3 ] ) , but much more for chemical coupling .",
    "also , the coefficient of variation of the interspike interval series becomes more degraded ( _ i.e. _ the system response is worst at the same system sizes ) in the chemical synapse case .",
    "these facts indicate that synchronization is worse for chemical than for electrical coupling .",

    ", height=219 ]    figure  [ fig4 ] plots the spike diagram for the two types of coupling discussed so far and for @xmath65 and @xmath52 neurons . by comparing the two columns we can observe that the system with chemical synapses has a charateristic delay time in the propagation of spikes between neurons larger than the corresponding to the electrical coupling . due to this delay",
    ", synchronization is rapidly lost in the case of chemical coupling . for electrical coupling",
    "the spikes also show slight propagation delays , but much smaller than in the chemical case . with the values of coupling constants chosen here ,",
    "both systems lose synchronicity at similar sizes .",
    "if we increased the value of the @xmath66 in the electrical coupling case , the system would remain synchronized for higher system sizes .",
    "this would not happen in the chemical case , because there the delay is intrinsic to the synapses and does not depend on the coupling strength .",
    "this is a fundamental , qualitative difference between chemical and electrical coupling , which is worth being highlighted .",
    "there are two main differences between coupling via chemical synapses and gap junctions .",
    "first , electrical coupling occurs continuously whereas chemical synapses are only active when the presynaptic neuron spikes .",
    "second , chemical coupling is intrinsically nonlinear , because beyond a certain threshold for the presynaptic neuron , the coupling signal has always the same shape .",
    "which one of these two features leads to enhancement of stochastic coherence reported above for the chemical coupling ?",
    "we postulate that the relevant feature that makes the chemical synapses more efficient to help neurons to fire is that chemical coupling is only effective when the presynaptic neuron fires .",
    "otherwise , two neighboring neurons are uncoupled .    to test this hypothesis we couple the neurons with an artificial synaptic current proportional to the difference between the voltages of the coupled membranes ( as in the usual linear coupling described in sect .",
    "[ subsec : lin ] ) , but just during a time @xmath67 after the presynaptic neuron has fired .",
    "this model , that we can call _ linear pulsed coupling _ , is a hybrid of the two models used above : the coupling is linear with the membrane potential , but the neurons are uncoupled as far as the presynaptic neuron does not fire .    the synaptic current affecting neuron @xmath20 due to the interaction with its neighboors can be written as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a pulse of width @xmath67 that turns on when the membrane potential of neuron @xmath33 is larger that a certain threshold ( @xmath70 in the present case ) . with this model ,",
    "a neuron is uncoupled from its neighbors if they are silent , and coupled during a time @xmath67 after one of them fires .",
    "we also calculate in this case the average time between consecutive spikes , @xmath49 and its normalized standard deviation @xmath59 , both for the spikes produced by the membrane potential of one neuron and for the average membrane potential .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .",
    "mean time between spikes @xmath49 ( upper plot ) and coefficient of variation @xmath54 ( lower plot ) for the membrane potential of one neuron ( lef panel ) and for the average membrane potential ( right panel ) .",

    "parameters are those of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( @xmath71  ns).,height=219 ]    analyzing the results for the local membrane potential ( left panel of fig .  [ fig5 ] )",
    ", we can see that the behavior in this case is similar to ( even better than ) the case of full chemical coupling : the response of a neuron to a purely noisy excitation is clearly enhanced already when only two neurons are coupled , and rapidly improves with system size , saturating after @xmath72 neurons .",
    "also , the coefficient of variation @xmath53 is as low as for chemical synapses .",
    "this happens even though coupling is linear when active .",
    "if we analyze the behavior of the average potential ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) , we can see that synchronization holds at even larger system sizes than for the previous natural coupling schemes . in this hybrid model ,",
    "the @xmath73 term enhances synchronization for large coupling strengths , but without losing enhancement as in the linear coupling model , due to the inactivation of the coupling in the time elapsed between spikes .    in summary ,",
    "array - enhanced stochastic coherence is present for linear pulsed coupling .",
    "the fact that , in this hybrid type of coupling , this term only turns on when presynaptic neurons fire , supports the hypothesis that the most important feature underneath the efficiency of the coupling is that the neurons remains uncoupled in absence of firing .",
    "the behavior exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] by the coefficient of variation @xmath53 of the average membrane potential in the chemical - coupling case displays a relevant feature : for small enough noise levels ( such as @xmath45  mv / ms ) , as the system size increases the regularity of the system increases ( _ i.e. _ the coefficient of variation decreases ) , only to degrade again for even larger system sizes .",
    "this is a system - size resonance effect .",

    "we report it for chemically coupled neurons .",

    "whereas in both cases , the lowest coherence is found for an optimal system size , the effect is more pronounced , and occurs at the same system size for the values of @xmath66 chosen .",
    "recent studies have shown that gap junctions are more efficient than chemical synapses in leading to synchronization @xcite .",
    "the evidence presented in this paper shows that chemical synapses are substantially more efficient than gap junctions in enhancing stochastic coherence in coupled neuron systems .",
    "this difference in efficiency stems from the fact that electrical coupling enhances correlations among neurons during interspike time intervals , which prevents neighboring elements to `` remind '' each other to fire at the right time .",
    "chemical coupling , on the other hand , has an intrinsic transmission delay and an intrinsic electrical isolation that degrades this correlation , making that cooperative effect possible .",
    "this is also reflected in the different behavior of both types of coupling versus coupling strength ( fig .",
    "[ newfig3 ] ) : for electrical coupling coherence is low only for a narrow window of coupling strengths ; for chemical coupling , on the other hand , low coherence arises even if coupling is large .",
    "clearly this difference arises from the fact that for diffusive coupling , large coupling levels lead to high synchronization ; for chemical coupling , on the other hand , synchronization does not improve even if coupling strength increases , due to the intrinsic delay .",
    "interneuron communication via chemical synapses is ubiquitous .",
    "its role must therefore be properly assessed when studying stochastic effects in neuronal dynamics .",
    "the results presented here show that this type of coupling is in fact beneficial for the system coherence .",
