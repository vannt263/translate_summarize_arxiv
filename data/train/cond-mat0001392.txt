    "the interaction between the periodicity of vortex lattices ( vl ) and periodic pinning potentials in superconductors has raised a great interest both in equilibrium systems @xcite and in driven non - equilibrium systems.@xcite several techniques have been used to artificially fabricate periodic pinning in superconducting samples : thickness modulated films,@xcite wire networks , @xcite josephson junction arrays , @xcite magnetic dot arrays,@xcite sub - micron hole lattices @xcite and pinning induced by bitter decoration .",
    "@xcite    the ground states of these systems , which result from the competition between the vortex - vortex and the vortex - pinning interactions , can be either commensurate or incommensurate vortex structures depending on the vortex density.@xcite these conmensurability effects in the ground state vortex configurations lead to enhanced critical currents and resistance minima for the `` matching '' and for the `` fractional '' ( submatching ) vortex densities where the vl is strongly pinned . at finite temperatures",
    ", it has been shown that there are both a depinning and a melting transition , which can occur either sequentially or simultaneously depending on the magnetic field .",
    "@xcite    very recently , the physics of driven vortices under periodic pinning has been studied numerically both at zero temperature @xcite and at finite temperatures.@xcite at @xmath6 there is a complex variety of dynamic phases .",
    "@xcite at finite @xmath7 there are two dynamic transitions when increasing temperature at high drives : there is first a transverse depinning and second a melting transition of the moving vortex lattice .",
    "most of the effects of periodic pinning that have been studied are related to conmensurability phenomena and the breaking of translational symmetry in these systems .",
    "less studied is the effect of the breaking of rotational symmetry in periodic pinning potentials , in particular regarding transport properties .",
    "one question of interest is how the motion of vortices changes when the direction of the driving current is varied .",
    "if there is rotational symmetry , the vortex motion and voltage response should be insensitive to the choice of the direction of the current .",
    "however , it is clear that in a periodic pinning potential the dynamics may depend on the direction of the current .",
    "for example , in square josephson junction arrays ( jja ) it has been found that the existence of fractional giant shapiro steps ( fggs ) depends on the orientation of the current bias . when the jja is driven in the [ 11 ] direction the fggs",
    "are absent , while they are very large when the drive is in the [ 10 ] direction.@xcite another example of more recent interest is the phenomenon of transverse critical current in superconductors with pinning.@xcite it has been found that for a vl a driven with a high current there is a transverse critical current when an additional small bias is applied in the perpendicular direction.@xcite furthermore , when the transverse bias is increased it is possible to have a rich behavior with a devil s staircase in the transverse voltage.@xcite    in this paper we will study in detail the breaking of rotational invariance in square jja . in this case , the discrete lattice of josephson junctions induces a periodic egg - carton potential for the motion of vortices.@xcite we will study here how the voltage response depends on the angle of the current with respect to the lattice directions of the square jja .",
    "we will show that there are preferred directions for vortex motion for which there is orientational pinning .",
    "this leads to an anomalous transverse voltage when vortices are driven in directions different from the symmetry directions .",
    "an analogous effect of a transverse voltage due to the guided motion of vortices has been observed in ybco superconductors with twin boundaries.@xcite another related case is the intrinsic breaking of rotational symmetry of d - wave superconductivity which causes an angle - dependent transverse voltage for large currents.@xcite here we will show the differences and similarities of the square jja with these problems .",

    "in particular , we will present experiments corresponding to the orientation for which the effect of a transverse voltage is maximum . finally in sec .",
    "v we will compare our results with other similar effects and discuss future directions of study .",
    "we study the dynamics of jja using the resistively shunted junction ( rsj)model for the junctions of the square network.@xcite in this case , the current flowing in the junction between two superconducting islands in a jja is modeled as the sum of the josephson supercurrent and the normal current : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the critical current of the junction between the sites @xmath10 and @xmath11 in a square lattice [ @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the normal state resistance and @xmath15 is the gauge invariant phase difference with @xmath16 the thermal noise fluctuations @xmath17 have correlations @xmath18    in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath19 we have @xmath20 @xmath21 and @xmath22 is the array lattice spacing .",

    "copper , and subsequently lead , were thermally evaporated onto a silicon substrate within the same evaporator .",
    "an array of @xmath58 lead islands were defined by photolithographic patterning followed by an ar ion etching .",

    "this mask was manually aligned in the [ 10 ] and [ 11 ] directions for different samples .",
    "the six - terminal measurements were made using a programable dc current source and a two channel nanovoltmeter ( hp 34420a ) .",
    "each channel measuring the longitudinal and transversal voltage respectively .",
    "the arrays were coooled up to 1.25 k in a pumped @xmath62he cryostat shielded by @xmath59-metal .",
    "a superconducting solenoid was used to null the remaining ambient magnetic field ( @xmath63 mg ) , and apply fields to the sample . the typical periodic - in - field response in the resistance were observed extending in a large number of periods , which was used to determine the frustration applied to the sample .",
    "the square lattice has two directions of maximum symmetry : the [ 10 ] and the [ 11 ] directions ( and the ones obtained from them by @xmath64 rotations ) , which correspond to the directions of reflection symmetry .",
    "when the current bias is in the [ 10 ] direction , the angle of the current is @xmath4 , and we call it a  parallel \" bias .",
    "when the current bias is in the [ 11 ] direction , the angle of the current is @xmath65 , and we call it a  diagonal \" bias .    in the case of the parallel bias we find that the transverse voltage is zero ( in agreement with the reflection symmetry ) .",
    "this corresponds to vortex motion in the direction perpendicular to the current ( @xmath66 ) . in the iv curve for the longitudinal voltage",
    "we find a critical current corresponding to the single vortex depinning @xmath67}=0.1 $ ] , @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "above @xmath68 it is possible to distinguish three regimes : @xcite ( * a * ) a single vortex regime for @xmath69 , where the iv is quasi - linear and dissipation is caused by vortex motion ; ( * b * ) an intermediate crossover regime for @xmath70 and ( * c * ) a resistive regime for @xmath71 where dissipation is caused by the ohmic shunt resistance and the iv curve is linear . the vortex regime * a * can be described by the dynamics of a single collective degree of freedom : an overdamped particle moving in the periodic  egg - carton \" potential,@xcite although with a non - linear viscosity.@xcite the resistive regime * c * is also very simple , it can be represented by the behavior of a single junction at large currents , @xmath72 . the crossover regime * b * is characterized by a complex collective dynamics with an interplay of the vortex degree of freedom with spin waves excitations , and at finite temperatures there is also a steep increase of vortex - antivortex excitations in this regime .    in the case of the diagonal bias ,",
    "we obtain similar results as in the parallel bias case .",
    "the transverse voltage is zero and therefore the vortex moves perpendicular to the current ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the iv curve for @xmath73 has a critical current of @xmath74}=\\sqrt{2}i_c^{[10]}=0.1414 $ ] .",
    "the onset of the resistive regime * c * is also multiplied by a factor of @xmath75 , while the crossover regime * b * starts at nearly the same current as in the parallel bias case , see fig .",
    "2(b ) .    for orientations different than the symmetry directions",
    ", we always find a finite transverse voltage . in order to see this",
    ", we study the voltage response when varying the orientation @xmath3 of the drive while keeping fixed the amplitude @xmath48 of the current . in fig .",
    "3(a ) we plot the transverse angle @xmath76 as a function of the angle of the current @xmath3 .",
    "we find that @xmath77 vanishes only in the maximum symmetry directions corresponding to angles @xmath78 , as discussed before .",
    "furthermore , we see that for orientations near @xmath4 , the transverse angle basically follows the current angle : @xmath79 .",
    "this is an indication that vortex motion is pinned in the lattice direction [ 10 ] , since @xmath80 , meaning that the voltage angle is @xmath81 . whenever the voltage response is insensitive to small changes in the orientation of the current",
    ", we will call this phenomenon _ orientational pinning_. on the other hand , near @xmath82 the transverse angle changes rapidly .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3(b - c ) the behavior of @xmath83 for different currents and temperatures .",
    "the @xmath83 vs. @xmath84 curves become smoother around @xmath85 for increasing current as well as for increasing @xmath7 . at the same time , the magnitude of the transverse angle decreases when increasing the current for @xmath86 , or when increasing @xmath7 .",
    "a more direct evidence of the breaking of rotational symmetry can be seen in the parametric curves of @xmath87 vs. @xmath88 . in fig .",
    "4 we plot the values of the voltages @xmath89 and @xmath90 when varying the orientational angle @xmath84 for different values of the current amplitude @xmath48 and the temperature . in the case of rotational symmetry we should have a perfect circle . in the set of plots of fig.4(a - c ) , the current amplitude is fixed and the temperature is varied . in fig.4(a ) we have @xmath91 , near the onset of single vortex motion in the regime * a*. in this case most of the points are either on the axis @xmath92 or on the axis @xmath93 , indicating strong orientational pinning in the lattice directions [ 10 ] or [ 01 ] . when increasing @xmath7 the orientational pinning decreases and the length of the `` horns '' in the @xmath30 and @xmath31 axis decreases .",
    "fig.4(b ) corresponds to @xmath94 , near the end of regime * a * when the vortex is moving fast . in this case",
    "the horns have disappeared and orientational pinning is lost .",
    "however , the breaking of rotational symmetry is still present in the star - shaped curves that we find at low @xmath7 .",
    "the dip at @xmath95 in the stars are because in this direction the voltages are minimum , since the critical current is maximum in this case , @xmath74}=0.1% \\sqrt{2}$ ] . when increasing the temperature , the stars tend to the circular shape of rotational invariance .",
    "the parametric curves in the crossover regime * b * also have star shaped behavior at low @xmath7 which tends to circles when increasing @xmath7 . above the onset of the resistive regime *",
    "c * the `` horned '' curves reappear [ fig .",
    "4(c ) ] . in this case the orientational",
    "pinning corresponds to the locking of ohmic dissipation in the junctions in one of the lattice directions , either [ 10 ] or [ 01 ] . once again , when increasing @xmath7 the horned structure shrinks , and the curves evolve continuously from square shapes to circular shapes .",
    "the variation with current of the rotational parametric curves for a fixed temperature is shown in figs.4(d - f ) . at a low temperature , @xmath96",
    ", we clearly see the horned structure of the curves for almost all the currents and even for large currents the circular curves have `` horns '' , see fig.4(d ) . at an intermediate temperature , @xmath97 , there are still some signatures of the orientational pinning [ fig .",
    "4(e ) ] , while for @xmath98 all the curves are smooth and rounded with a slightly square shape [ fig .",
    "4(f ) ] .",
    "the orientational pinning characterizes the breaking of rotational symmetry in square arrays at low temperatures , as we have seen in the previous section . when the jja is driven in any of the `` parallel '' directions , @xmath99 both vortex motion and dissipation",
    "are pinned along these directions . when the current is rotated a small angle , for example from the [ 10 ] direction ,",
    "the dissipation remains pinned along the [ 10 ] direction ( @xmath100 , @xmath101 ) .",
    "this effect causes a finite transverse voltage , measured with respect to the direction of the current , @xmath102 and a transverse angle @xmath103 .",
    "the orientational pinning is lost at a given critical angle @xmath104 which depends on temperature and current . as we can see in fig .",
    "3(a ) , for very low @xmath7 and for certain values of the current , the critical angle can reach values very close to @xmath105 .",
    "this leads to a large transverse voltage in arrays driven near the [ 11 ] direction as we will discuss later in sec .",
    "let us analyze now the behavior of the critical angle for orientational depinning , @xmath106 .",
    "this can be studied by looking at the angle of the voltage with respect to the [ 10 ] direction , @xmath107 . for @xmath108",
    "we have orientational pinning and therefore @xmath109 , while for @xmath110 we have @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , the onset of a finite @xmath112 defines the critical angle @xmath106 . in fig .",
    "5 we plot @xmath112 as a function of @xmath84 for different currents and temperatures .",
    "there are two cases of interest : for a current in the single vortex regime * a * [ fig .",
    "5(a ) ] and for a current in the resistive regime * c * [ fig .",
    "we find that in both cases there is clearly a finite @xmath106 which decreases with temperature . in the case of the single vortex regime",
    "* a * , we see that @xmath113 tends to vanish at a crossover temperature corresponding to the energy scale for vortex depinning,@xcite @xmath114 .",
    "the notion of `` transverse critical current '' @xmath115 has been introduced recently by giamarchi and le doussal for driven vortex lattices in random pinning .",
    "@xcite when a vortex structure is moving fast , it can still be pinned in the transverse direction . after applying a current in the direction perpendicular to the drive",
    ", a finite transverse critical current may exist at @xmath6 . in the case of periodic",
    "pinning , a finite @xmath115 was also proposed due to conmensurability effects.@xcite in particular , in the periodic `` egg - carton '' pinning of josephson junction arrays it was found in ref . that @xmath115 is finite in a wide range of temperatures for a system driven in the [ 10 ] direction . here",
    "we see that due to the orientational pinning , a transverse critical current is finite only when the jja is driven either in the [ 10 ] or [ 01 ] directions . in any other case",
    "it will be zero .",
    "moreover , the critical angle in the regime * a * can be interpreted as corresponding to a transverse critical current @xmath116 for a vortex driven by a longitudinal current @xmath117 .    in fig .",
    "5(b ) we see that for a current in the resistive regime * c * there is also a critical angle for the onset of transverse ohmic dissipation . in this case",
    "@xmath118 tends to vanish at a higher temperature above the kosterlitz - thouless transition , @xmath119 .",
    "the other lattice symmetry direction of interest corresponds to the case of `` diagonal '' bias , i.e. the [ 11 ] directions of @xmath120 . in this case , we have shown previously that the transverse voltage also vanishes . in agreement with this , we see both in fig .",
    "5(a ) and fig .",
    "5(b ) that all the curves cross in the point @xmath121 , which corresponds to @xmath122 . however , there is no orientational pinning in the [ 11 ] direction . on the contrary , in this direction",
    "any small deviation in the orientation of the current can cause a fast increase of the transverse voltage . in order to show this effect , we study the `` diagonal voltage angle '' , which is measured with respect to @xmath123 : @xmath124 @xmath125 , as a function of the deviation from the [ 11 ] direction , @xmath126 , see fig .  6 .",
    "we find that , in contrast with the case of fig .  5 ,",
    "a small deviation from the symmetry direction leads to a large change in the voltage angle for any current and temperature .",
    "this shows that the [ 11 ] direction is highly unstable against small changes in the orientation of the current , leading to an anomalously large transverse voltage .      in fig .",
    "7(a ) we show our experimental voltage - current characteristics for an array of @xmath127 junctions at a low temperature @xmath128 and at a low magnetic field .",
    "the current is applied nominally in the [ 11 ] direction , but a small misalignment is possible in the setup of electrical contacts , therefore @xmath129 .",
    "we see that for low currents there is a very large value of the transverse voltage @xmath130 , which is nearly of the same magnitude as the longitudinal voltage @xmath131 .",
    "the transverse voltage is maximum at a characteristic current @xmath132 . above @xmath132 ,",
    "@xmath130 decreases with increasing current while @xmath131 increases .",
    "it is remarkable that these results are very different from the iv curve of fig .  2 , where @xmath133 at @xmath134 .",
    "however , if we assume a misalignment of a few degrees with respect to the [ 11 ] direction we can reproduce the experimental results . in fig .",
    "7(b ) we show the iv curves obtained numerically for @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "we see that for low currents @xmath130 is close to @xmath137 : @xmath138 , similar to the experiment , and later @xmath130 has a maximum at a current @xmath139 .",
    "this corresponds to the current for which the junctions in the @xmath30-direction become critical ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "the range of currents we can measure experimentally is limited to the regimes * b * and * c * , since we can not fully access the regime * a * of single vortex motion due to the small voltages involved in this case .",
    "of course , in the simulations we can study the full range of currents , which is shown in fig .",
    "7(c ) . here",
    "we see that near the vortex depinning current the transverse voltage is also very close to @xmath73 in a small range of currents , then when increasing @xmath48 they separate first inside the regime * a * , and later in the regime * b * the transverse voltage approaches the longitudinal voltage again .    as we saw in fig .",
    "3 the highest transverse voltage can be obtained for orientations near @xmath141 .",
    "therefore a slight misalignment of the array from the [ 11 ] direction is useful for studying both experimentally and numerically the behavior of the transverse voltage as a function of current and temperature .    in fig .",
    "8 we show the dependence of @xmath77 with current for different temperatures .",
    "the experimental results are shown in fig.8(a ) where we find that @xmath77 first increases with current , it reaches a maximum value @xmath142 and then for large currents @xmath77 tends to zero . in fig .",
    "8(b ) we show that the simulations with the rsj model with @xmath143 reproduce this behavior . here",
    "we see that the maximum of the transverse angle is reached inside the regime * b * well before the onset of the resistive regime .",
    "we also find that , when going deep into the regime * c * , @xmath77 decreases with current : @xmath144 for @xmath145 . in fig .",
    "8(c ) we show that a similar behavior is obtained for other values of @xmath3 close to @xmath105 .",
    "we also observe here the full range of currents .",
    "we see that at the critical current the transverse angle @xmath77 first has a maximum , then it decreases rapidly in a small range of currents , after which , for most of the regime * a * , @xmath77 is increasing with @xmath146 before reaching a second maximum value in the crossover regime * b*. this shows that there are two regimes where the effect of anomalous transverse voltage is maximum : near the vortex depinning current , due to orientational pinning of vortex motion ; and near the josephson junction critical current due to the orientational `` pinning '' of ohmic dissipation .",
    "regretfully , we can not measure the small voltages of the low current regime , therefore we were not able to observe experimentally the first maximum of @xmath77 .    in fig .  9",
    "we analyze the behavior of the transverse angle as a function of temperature .",
    "we plot the value of @xmath77 for a current near the maximum value of the transverse voltage at low @xmath7 .",
    "we observe experimentally that @xmath147 decreases with temperature and in particular it has a sharp decrease at @xmath148 , as we show in fig .",
    "on the other hand , in the simulation results we see a smooth decrease of @xmath77 with temperature [ fig .",
    "the transverse angle becomes small at the depinning crossover temperature @xmath149 .",
    "the fact that our experimental results show a sharper decrease with temperature than the simulations is possibly due to vortex collective effects .",
    "the simulation results presented here are focused in the motion of a single vortex in the periodic pinning of a square jja .",
    "the vortex collective effects , which have to be studied for fields @xmath150 , will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "in the egg - carton potential of a square jja there are pinning barriers for vortex motion in all the directions .",
    "the direction with the lowest pinning barrier is the [ 10 ] direction .",
    "therefore the strong orientational pinning we find here is in the direction of the lowest pinning for motion , i.e. the direction of easy flow for vortices .",
    "the presence of a strong orientational pinning leads to a large transverse voltage when the systems is driven away from the favorable direction , to the existence of a critical angle and to a transverse critical current . on the other hand , the [ 11 ] direction",
    "is the direction of the largest barrier for vortex motion in the egg - carton potential . in this case , the behavior is highly unstable against small variations in the angle of the drive , leading to a rapid change from zero transverse voltage to a large transverse voltage within a few degrees .",
    "this explains the transverse voltage observed in our experimental measurements in jja  driven near the diagonal [ 11 ] orientation .",
    "an analogous effect of orientational pinning has also been seen in experiments on ybco superconductors with twin boundaries .",
    "@xcite in this case , due to the correlated nature of the disorder , the direction for easy flow is the direction of the twins . a similar effect of horns in the parametric voltage curves",
    "are therefore observed in the direction corresponding to the twins .",
    "also transport measurements when the sample is driven at an angle with respect to the twin show a large transverse voltage .",
    "it is interesting to compare with the angle - dependent transverse voltage calculated for d - wave superconductors.@xcite also in this case , the transverse voltage vanishes only in the [ 10 ] and [ 11 ] directions .",
    "however the @xmath83 vs. @xmath84 curves are smooth in this case , since @xmath151.@xcite this is because there is no pinning and the transverse voltage is caused only by the intrinsic nature of the d - wave ground state .",
    "on the other hand , the breaking of rotational symmetry studied here is induced by the pinning potential , and it results in non - smooth responses like `` horned '' parametric voltage curves , critical angles , transverse critical currents , etc .    in superconductors with a square array of pinning centers ,",
    "typically the pins are of circular shape and the size of the pins is much smaller than the distance between pinning sites.@xcite in this case , the pinning barriers that vortices find for motion are the same in many directions .",
    "therefore it is possible to have orientational pinning in many of the square lattice symmetry directions .",
    "this explains the rich structure of a devil s staircase observed recently in the simulations of reichhardt and nori , where each plateau corresponds to orientational pinning in each of the several possible directions for orientational pinning .",
    "this interesting behavior is not possible in jja , however , since the egg - carton pinning potential corresponds to the situation of square - shaped pinning centers with the pin size equal to the interpin distance . in this case",
    "the only possible directions for orientational pinning are the [ 10 ] and [ 01 ] , as we have seen here .",
    "it is worth noting that many experiments in jja in the past have been done in samples with a diagonal bias .",
    "for example , van wees _",
    "et al._@xcite have observed the existence of a transverse voltage in their measurements , which was unexplained .",
    "a small misalignment of their direction of the current drive could easily explain their results , since we have learned here that the [ 11]-direction is unstable against small changes in the angle of the bias .",
    "also chen _",
    "et al._@xcite have reported a transverse angle in measurements in jja driven in the diagonal direction . in their case",
    "the effect has a strong component that is antisymmetric against a change in the direction of the magnetic field , which means that they have a hall effect possibly due to quantum effects .",
    "however , they report that their transverse voltage had also a component which was even with the magnetic field ( which was discounted in their computation of the hall angle ) .",
    "this particular spurious contribution can also be attributed to a small misalignment of the direction of the bias . from this",
    "we conclude that in order to study the hall effect in jja the most convenient choice would be a current bias in the [ 10 ] direction where the effect of transverse voltages at small deviations is minimum .",
    "when this work was upon completion , new studies of the effect of the orientation of the bias in driven square jja have appeared .",
    "fisher , stroud and janin @xcite have studied some of the effects of the direction of current in a fully frustrated jja ( @xmath152 ) at @xmath6 . in their case",
    "a transverse critical critical current and the dynamics as a function of @xmath153 and @xmath154 has been described .",
    "their results are in part complementary to our work with a single vortex ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "yoon , choi and kim @xcite find differences in the iv characteristics of jja at @xmath155 when comparing the parallel current bias with the diagonal current bias .",
    "their results are in agreement with our fig .  2 results .",
    "in this paper we have considered the dynamics of a single vortex in a square jja .",
    "we were able to characterize in detail the orientational pinning and breaking of rotational symmetry in this case .",
    "furthermore , with the results of the rsj numerical calculation we were able reproduce and interpret most of our experimental measurements for a quasi - diagonal bias .",
    "it remains for the future to study the behavior of a driven vortex lattice ( vl ) when the current is rotated , since the vl has also its own periodicity and symmetry directions . as we saw recently in ref .",
    ", a moving vortex lattice in a jja shows different dynamical phases as a function of temperature and current .",
    "therefore we expect that the characteristics of the breaking of rotational invariance , orientational pinning and transverse voltages will depend on the dynamical phase under consideration .",
