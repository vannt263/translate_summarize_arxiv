    "a consensus is now forming that quasar activities are triggered through mergers of gas - rich massive galaxies .",
    "the evidence accumulated in the past decade includes the presence of tidal tails in their host galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and signatures of a recent starburst in the off - nuclear spectrum ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the composite spectrum of less luminous agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the merger of gas - rich galaxies also leads to starburst in the nuclear as well as outskirt regions .",
    "as such , most of these systems appear as luminous or ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( @xmath4 , ulirgs ) .",
    "the connection between ulirgs and quasars has been widely discussed , and there is evidence for an evolution sequence between the two ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "vigorous starburst and nuclear activity will result in a strong negative feedback to the host galaxy .",
    "massive winds have been observed in starburst galaxies , ulirg and agn with mass outflow rates from 10 to 1000 m  yr@xmath5 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it was proposed that such a feedback will quench gas supply to the agn and the star - formation region , and result in a sudden halt of the star - formation process in the galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the passively evolved galaxies will first appear as e+a in the subsequent @xmath6 1 gyr , and then as red galaxies .",
    "the latter can explain the red colors of massive early type galaxies @xcite .",
    "if quasar activity is going - on for sometime after the star - formation essentially ceased , the object will show characteristics of q+a .",
    "q+a s have been detected now with a large number in the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "most of these systems show weak [ ] emission , likely from the narrow line region ( nlr ) , indicating that major star - forming activity has ceased@xcite , or , at least , is greatly suppressed .",
    "indeed , ho ( 2005 ) found that the ratio of sfr to mass accretion rate in pg quasars is well below that required for sustaining the @xmath7 relation for nearby spheroid galaxies .",
    "it was further suggested that this is due to that star formation is suppressed rather than that cold gas is exhausted .",
    "it should be noted that the author used the [ ] emission - line luminosity to infer sfr , for which the reddening correction is largely uncertain , however .",
    "gas outflows are thought to play an important role in the galactic scale feedback .",
    "outflows on scales of tens to hundreds parsecs have been observed in nearby seyfert galaxies and radio galaxies with velocities of a few hundreds to thousand  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "however , modeling the absorption and emission lines for well - studied nearby seyfert galaxies suggested a relative low mass loss rate and small kinetic power in these outflows ( crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ) .",
    "even higher velocity outflows , from a few @xmath8 to @xmath9 , are detected in broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the scale and the total mass in bal outflows are still not clear , neither the relation between the bal region ( balr ) and the narrow / broad emission - line region ( n / belr ) .",
    "the recent intensive starburst in the circum - nuclear region has also significant implications for the gas phase metallicity .",
    "massive stars evolve very fast and produce a chemical pollution in the circum - nuclear ism primarily with @xmath10-elements via s , while less massive stars evolve much slowly and make their chemical contribution of iron peaked elements , mainly through snia , with a delay of at least 1 gyr .",
    "the detail abundance pattern depends on both the history of star - formation and the stellar initial mass function .",
    "supersolar metallicity has been suggested by analyzing the broad line and broad absorption line spectra ( e.g. , hamann 1997 ; baldwin et al .",
    "2003 ) , which are produced in a relative small region enclosed the active nucleus .",
    "however , it is still not clear whether this reflects an over - all high metallicity or only these elements concerned .    in this paper",

    "however , it was not detected by xmm - newton @xcite , which led these authors to propose that it is a compton - thick , type ii object . the optical image taken with hubble space telescope ( hst ) showed a strong disturbed morphology possibly with a double nucleus of separation less than 1 kpc , suggesting a recent merger of two gas - rich galaxies @xcite .",
    "darling & giovanelli ( 2002 ) detected an oh megmaser with a multi - peaked profile , which they interpreted as possible multiple masser nuclei .",
    "here we show that its broad band properties are consistent with an obscured quasar .",

    "the ssp spectra @xmath26 was taken from starburst99 models @xcite . the high resolution ssp models are only available for the solar abundance with a wavelength coverage of @xmath27 , and with ages from 1 to 20 myr for either an instantaneous burst or a continuous star formation . to extend to the full wavelength range of the fos spectrum , we use the interpolated low resolution model of starburst99 for @xmath281870 .",
    "this is reasonable since the extrapolated wavelength range is rather small ( @xmath29 ) and free from strong stellar absorption lines .",
    "the uv continuum can be reasonably well fitted with this simple model ( fig [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "we use both smc and calzetti s extinction curves . but the best fitted model with calzetti s extinction curve predicts an optical flux well above the sdss spectrum , thus will not be discussed further .",

    "the derived stellar mass is 9@xmath34 m. using the smc extinction curve , we obtain a similar reddening ( @xmath35 ) and a slightly younger stellar population ( 0.64 gyr ) with a somewhat smaller total stellar mass ( 13%  less ) . with those exercises ,",
    "albeit with some uncertainties , we conclude that a few @xmath36 mstellar mass has been built within the last gyr in the host of q 132 + 058 .",
    "note the older stellar population has a negligible contribution to the uv flux .",
    "the power - law model yields a fit to uv spectrum as good as the ssp model .",
    "therefore , we can not distinguish two models from the uv fit alone . if both power - law index and reddening vary freely , they are poorly constrained . for an unreddened power - law",

    "not only such a flat uv spectrum has never been observed in quasars , but also the reddened corrected uv flux around 1400   is a factor of 3600 times the observed value , which gives an uv luminosity well larger than the total infrared luminosity estimated in ",

    "the strong 191 emission in component 2 is a puzzle .",
    "first , its emission region can not be reddened as severely as indicated by the apparent balmer decrement , which suggests an intrinsic dust reddening of e(b - v)=1.2 mag using calzetti s extinction curve for an intrinsic h@xmath10/h@xmath11=3.0 .",
    "this indicates either a large intrinsic h@xmath10/h@xmath11 or a separated 191 emission region .",
    "second , because of lack a similar component in other uv lines , 191 must be produced in a region shielded from intensive uv ionizing radiation .",
    "while whether this can be consistent with the prominent emission in [ ] and [ ] needs to be further studied , a large column density may explain this .",
    "third , 191 is strong while optical emission is weak .",
    "the dominance of emission from high excitation levels indicates that either it is formed in a high temperature and dense hi region or / and through uv photon excitation by the continuum radiation ( pcr ) .",
    "a high temperature and dense hi region may help to explain h@xmath10/h@xmath11 ratio in this component through collisional enhancement of h@xmath10 emission . because this component is blueshifted by  350 km  s@xmath5 with respect to the systematic velocity , interaction between the outflow and interstellar medium",
    "may be a viable heating source .",
    "pcr process had been suggested for the emission from the wind of spectroscopic binary kq puppis ( redfors & johansson 2000 ) . in order to make photon - pumping effective",
    ", the gas must see a strong soft uv photons and has large internal velocity gradient .",
    "we speculate that an ionizing continuum filtered by a thin partial ionized source may mimic the soft uv photons ( see a similar idea in collins et al .",
    "the pcr process would also produce 193 emission lines at 1459 , 1465 , 1474   but the spectrum quality does not allow us to assess their existence .    therefore , we tentatively interpret this component as from a dense region : the large balmer decrement is interpreted as due to radiation transfer effect or caused by collisional excitation in the warm dense hi region , rather than dust reddening ; 191 is produced either in a high temperature warm hi region or through pcr process ; [ ] , [ ] are suppressed by collisional de - excitation .",
    "the blueshift of c2 ( 350 ) relative to the systematic velocity can be readily interpreted as from an outflow with the far - side , redshifted counter - flow being obscured .",

    "this may be explained in terms of at least two emission line regions with different densities .",
    "such models , however , have certain drawbacks as the following .",
    "if the high and low density gases are at the same distances and see the same continuum , the large difference in density would result in an ionization parameter for the low density gas being three orders of magnitude higher than that for the high density gas ; this would lead to strong coronal emission lines , such as [ fe vii ] , which are not seen in the observed spectrum .",
    "a single zone model can be constructed if si element is enhanced relative to c. overabundance of @xmath10-elements relative to c is predicted by the starburst chemical evolution models for quasar host galaxies ( haimann & ferland 1993 ) .",
    "considering the fact that q1321 + 058 experienced a recent starburst ( see next section ) , this chemical enrichment route is plausible . in their models ,",
    "more massive stars are produced with respect to star formation in the galaxy , thus leads to both fast metal enrichment and a high final metal abundance ( @xmath64 10 z ) .",

    "we only want to point out here that once such an ionizing continuum is adopted , the ionization parameter will be close to , but substantially larger than , the higher ionization paramter estimate based on ] / ratio . therefore , we interprete c4 as a dense outflow drivening by agn .",
    "in q 1321 + 058 , we have detected emission lines from two outflow components , c2 and c4 .",
    "the broad component c4 with a radial velocity 1650 has been interpreted as dense , metal enriched outflow photoionized by agn continuum , probably filtered by an ionized absorber in last section .",

    "the mass of the outflow can be estimated from the h@xmath10 luminosity as follows @xmath84 assuming case - b recombination with a temperature of 10@xmath85 k ( table 4.2 of osterbrock 1989 ) .",

    "the mass loss rate is small compared to the mass accretion rate onto the supermassive black hole .",
    "the emission line gas is visible for a dynamic time scale of @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the visible radial length of the outflow , and @xmath95 is the observed radial velocity . by combining with the mass in eq [ massestimate ] ,",

    "[ emissiongas ] , the corrections due to hi gas are within a factor of two .",
    "the mass loss rate is order of 0.03 m  yr@xmath5 if @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the mass loss rate for these outflow is not important with respect to the mass accretion rate onto the supermassive black hole ( see next section )",
    ".    the c4 outflow does not provide sufficient kinetic power to account for the feedback that is supposed to heat the cold gas in the host galaxy up to the escape velocity .",
    "the kinetic power with the line emitting gas is only on the order of @xmath98  m @xmath99  yr@xmath5 , or 10@xmath100 of the agn bolometric luminosity according to the mass loss rate in eq [ rate ] and the observed outflow velocity , while a few percent is required for the flow to be energetically important ( e.g. , di matteo et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a similar conclusion has been reached by modelling absorption lines for nearby seyfert galaxies ( crenshaw , kraemer & george 2003 ) .",
    "however , instead to conclude that outflows are energetically un - important for agn - galaxy feedback , we argue below that there is an indication for much larger kinetic power than the above estimate . as we have seen in the last section that the column density of the emission gas is fairly low , of order of @xmath101  @xmath46 .",
    "a gas cloud with such column density , density and typical temperature of photoionized gas is not bounded by self - gravity , thus it will either disperse away on the time scales of only 10 years ( i.e. , @xmath102 pc ) or be confined by external pressure . in the former case , continuous formation of the line emitting gas is required , and the mass outflow rate would be 40 m  yr@xmath5 , and total kinetic power would be three magnitude higher than the above estimate , which is sufficient to explain agn - galaxy feedback . in the latter case , the confined medium can be hot phase gas .",
    "since the filling factor of the warm gas is extremely small ( @xmath103 ) , the bulk of the gas will be in the hot phase , and both the mass loss rate and the kinetic power may be much larger than above estimate . hot gas has been detected in nearby ultra - luminous infrared agn including ngc 6240 ( komossa et al . 2003 ) .",
    "future high spatial resolution x - ray observations can be used to examine if such a hot x - ray component presents in this quasar as well .",
    "the covering factor of the emission line regions can be estimated from the ratio of h@xmath10 to the ionizing photon flux assuming case - b recombination if the emission line region is optically thick to the ionizing photons .",
    "it turns out that the covering factor of c4 is as small as 6@xmath104 .",
    "similar numbers ( order of @xmath105 ) are also obtained by comparing the ] 1909 , [ ] @xmath25007 or h@xmath10 luminosity with the best photoionization model in the last section in combination with above distances . for comparison ,",
    "the covering factor of the nlr in quasars is typically a few percent according to simple photon - counting estimation ( e.g. , netzer &  laor 1993 ) .",
    "thus , the agn outflows in q 1321 + 058 has a covering factor 100 times smaller than a typical nlr .    in passing , with a maximum velocity extending to @xmath64000   and",
    "emission lines of a wide ionization range , q1321 + 058 would appear as a lobal quasar if the line of sight to the nuclear continuum is intercepted by the outflow .",
    "we speculate that q 1321 + 058 is an obscured , high luminosity version of mkn 231 , an extensively studied infrared luminous low ionization bal qso with an extended outflow region on kpc scale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the requirement of a soft ionizing continuum for c4 is also consistent with weak x - ray emission from bal qsos .",
    "we would like to point out that the properties of outflow in c2 component is very uncertain .",
    "first , emission requires an extensive warm hi region , but its column density can not be properly constrained without extensive modelling of the feii emission .",
    "thus , eq ( [ rate ] ) will give only a lower limit to the mass loss rate .",
