    "adoption of leds as lighting source can significantly reduce energy consumption and at the same time offering high speed wireless communication , which is the primary focus of visible light communication ( vlc ) research @xcite .",
    "most of the existing schemes employ blue leds with a yellow phosphor coating , while with red / green / blue ( rgb ) leds higher data rate is possible because of wavelength division multiplexing .    with rgb leds , color - shift keying ( csk )",
    "was recommended by the ieee 802.15.7 visible light communication task group @xcite .",

    "considered the constellation design for csk to minimize the bit error rate ( ber ) subject to some lighting constraints @xcite .",
    "despite the fact that the three - dimensional constellation design problems have been formulated in @xcite , a few important questions have not been addressed .",
    "they include how to compare a system with csk employed and a conventional decoupled system , the constellation design , and the peak - to - average power ratio ( papr ) reduction  @xcite . in this paper , we propose a novel constellation design scheme in high dimensional space , termed csk - advanced . in our design , arbitrary number of red , blue , and green leds can be selected . with any average optical intensity and average color selected",
