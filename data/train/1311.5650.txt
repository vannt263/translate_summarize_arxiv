    "functorial invariants of 3-manifolds , more commonly referred to as topological quantum field theories , or tqfts , have opened up a new view in low - dimensional topology and spurred much research since their axiomatic formulation by atiyah in @xcite .",
    "recall that a tqft is a functor @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the category of 2-framed cobordisms between standard surfaces , up to homeomorphism .",
    "numerous non - trivial constructions began to emerge around 1990 , including those of dijkgraaf - witten , reshetikhin - turaev , turaev - viro , witten , and others .",
    "for some examples , see @xcite .    for a finite - dimensional , quasi - triangular , ribbon hopf algebra @xmath2",
    ", we can construct a tqft @xmath3 using tangle presentations of @xmath1 and a calculus of planar diagrams of links decorated with elements of @xmath2 .",
    "this construction , in the case of closed 3-manifolds , was introduced by hennings in @xcite , reformulated by kauffman and radford in @xcite , and extended to a tqft by kerler in @xcite .",
    "the main result of this paper is an extension of this construction to the case where @xmath2 is a quasi - triangular ribbon quasi - hopf algebra in the sense of drinfeld @xcite .",
    "the main complication with using a quasi - hopf algebra is that the coassociativity condition is relaxed in the following way : there exists some element @xmath4 so that @xmath5 for every @xmath6 .",
    "we also require some additional normalization conditions such as @xmath7 for a right cointegral @xmath8 , and that the monodromy element @xmath9 is nondegenerate in the sense of definition [ mnondegen ] .",
    "see definition [ assumptions ] for specifics .    for technical reasons , we will use @xmath10 , the category of once - punctured cobordisms , instead of @xmath1 . see @xcite .",
    "the main theorem will then be the following .",
    "( theorem [ thisisthemainidea ] ) given a normalized unimodular quasi - hopf algebra @xmath2 , there exists a well - defined hennings tqft @xmath11 extending the usual hennings construction .",
    "an important note is that all of our constructions will reduce to those in @xcite in the case that the cocycle is trivial , and will further reduce to the case of @xcite in the case that the cocycle is trivial and we work only with links .",
    "some algebraic elements of the construction were discussed in 1992 by altschuler and coste in @xcite , but they do not give a full definition of the tqft .",
    "the two main technical challenges we face in proving theorem [ thisisthemainidea ] are handling integrals and cointegrals in the quasi - associative situation , and developing a calculus on tangles that contains information about the coassociator . to address the former difficulty , we have the following lemma in section [ quasiint ] , extending results in @xcite .",

    "the pentagon axiom corresponds exactly to the group cocycle condition .",
    "it is generally believed that this quasi - hopf algebra is related to the tqft of dijkgraaf and witten @xcite , or its reformulations by wakui @xcite or freed and quinn @xcite , as this tqft is defined using the same 3-cocycle @xmath17 .",
    "a precise correspondence between the two notions is difficult to formulate without a tqft defined from @xmath15}$ ] .",
    "the hennings tqft provides this equivalence in the case where the cocycle is trivial or @xmath18 @xcite . using the formulation of the hennings tqft for quasi - hopf algebras",
