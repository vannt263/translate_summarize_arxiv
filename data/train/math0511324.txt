    "localised analyses in one dimension have proven to be remarkably successful ",
    "notably so wavelet analyses . the latter is based on the idea that observed signals varying over an increasing argument , time say , exhibit disparate and highly localised behaviour associated with variations at a particular scale and at particular time points .",
    "analysis is based on the wavelet transform , given for signal @xmath1 using wavelet @xmath2 via @xmath3 where @xmath4 is referred to as the _ scale _ , @xmath5 the _ translation _ and @xmath6 denotes conjugation .",
    "this allows for the recognition of patterns specific to time localisations @xmath5 and length scales associated with scale @xmath7 if the function @xmath8 is chosen such that the support of @xmath8 is essentially limited to a region near the origin , and the support of the fourier transform of @xmath9 is essentially limited to a region near some non - zero reference frequency @xmath10 a function can not be perfectly compact in time and frequency simultaneously , and so other criteria have been specified to determine the localisation properties of @xmath11 of particular note is the idea of a localisation operator , generalizing the truncation in time or frequency operators @xcite to _ simultaneously _ localising in time and frequency / scale @xcite .",
    "the eigenfunctions / eigenvectors of such operators are optimally localised with respect to the operator and in one dimension the problem of defining appropriate operators and calculating their eigenfunctions has been considered in detail @xcite .",
    "+ the choice of extension of decomposition to two dimensional analysis is not trivial since variation in the spatial variable is associated with a direction , as well as a scale . this direction can not be assumed to be aligned with the observational coordinate axes , and thus analysis using a simple tensor product of one - dimensional wavelets is , in general , not suitable . in two dimensions",
    "localisation is made to spatial point @xmath12^t,$ ] in scale to @xmath4 and in orientation to angle @xmath13 _ cf _ @xcite .",
    "the two dimensional continuous wavelet decomposition of image @xmath14 using wavelet @xmath15 is constructed via @xmath16 where ( @xmath17 ) represents a dilation , ( @xmath18 ) a translation and ( @xmath19 ) a rotation of @xmath15 giving @xmath20 with @xmath21 given as the rotation matrix .",
    "the decomposition will , with an appropriate choice of wavelet function , uncover / disentangle behaviour across specific spatial points , scales and orientation .",
    "local two dimensional patterns in general may be intrinsically one dimensional , i.e. after a suitable rotation all variation is along a single axis , or intrinsically two dimensional , i.e. there is variation in several directions , operating at the same scale emanating from one spatial point .",
    "following remarks by @xcite we focus on wavelet analysis of discontinuities and oscillatory structure .",
    "note that edges , or spatial discontinuities , have an orientation if they locally correspond to ( one dimensional ) curved discontinuities whilst ( two dimensional ) point discontinuities have no associated orientation .",
    "oscillations may structurally take the form of one dimensional objects such as repeated lines with an even spacing that , if rotated to the appropriate axes , can be locally described as constant in one variable and as a sinusoid in the other .",
    "two dimensional oscillations , circularly emanating from a single point , when considered locally at a distance from their source may be described approximately as one dimensional oscillations . +",
    "thus the structure of an image is highly orientation dependent , and analysis methods should disentangle both locally one dimensional and two dimensional structures operating at many different orientations . a well known feature of wavelet analysis , @xcite is that genuinely two dimensional structure , _",
    "i.e. _ point discontinuities , are well represented in a wavelet decomposition , and so in this paper we focus instead on the treatment of locally one dimensional structures by adjusting the wavelet transform suitably .",
    "we shall discuss two existing strategies for considering oriented scale - based decompositions , and construct a new method corresponding to a synthesis of the two methods discussed .",
    "this method can extract the local orientation of the image explicitly , in a multi - scale framework .",
    "+ existing continuous wavelet methods that deal with the orientation of the image explicitly are based on directionally selective filters , or _ directional wavelets .",
    "_ antoine & murenzi @xcite define complex directional wavelets with a preferred orientation in the frequency domain , as their frequency support is limited to a pre - defined cone , parameterised via the opening and closing angles of the cone @xcite . defining highly directional wavelets will necessitate an elongation of the wavelets in the spatial frequency domain , and this affects their spatial and spatial frequency resolution capacity  along a specific orientation in the frequency domain , the wavelets localise badly in frequency , and for this reason we do not use directional wavelets .",
    "directional wavelets will localise in scale _ and _ direction , whilst spatially isotropic wavelets only separate features at different scales .",
    "we shall use an isotropic wavelet decomposition to separate out disparate components occurring at either different scales and the same spatial locations , or at the same scales at different spatial locations . to facilitate this separation of structure , wavelets that are optimally concentrated in radial space and radial frequency",
    "are required , as in two dimensions the notion of spatial distance is naturally associated with the cartesian metric .",
    "we define a family of radial two - dimensional localisation operators and find the radial eigenfunctions of any given operator in this family , denoted the isotropic morse wavelets .",
    "any operator in this family is characterised via two parameters that determine the spatial / spatial frequency structure of the isotropic eigenfunctions .",
    "any choice of the parameters fixes a particular operator that in turn possesses a family of eigenfunctions .",
    "these functions are orthogonal and indexed via @xmath22 the eigenvalues explicitly give the radial concentration of the eigenfunctions .",
    "these eigenfunctions are related ( but not equivalent ) to the eigenfunctions of the one dimensional morse localisation operator @xcite . for every fixed value of @xmath23 and given radial eigenfunction",
    ", we define an additional pair of functions , whose joint norm may be considered to have the same localisation in space and spatial scale as the original radial function , but when combined with the original radial function will disentangle the local orientation of the image analysed .",
    "these extra pairs of functions are constructed explicitly to consider local orientation and phase . +",
    "a method for considering local phase structure is to extend the notion of instantaneous frequency @xcite ; @xcite give extensions to instantaneous frequency and local phase structure in the spatial domain , and for each spatial point retrieve a local phase / variational structure .",
    "these extensions correspond to the calculation of several additional images , or quadrature components , at each spatial point , where each additional set of components is considered to have the same local spatial energy and variational structure as the original image .",
    "the full set of components is used to calculate the local orientation and variational structure .",
    "the additional components are ill - defined when constructed from multi - component images , as then a single component with a spatially varying phase function is not an appropriate model for the original image .",
    "it thus becomes necessary to combine the calculation of a local phase with scale - localised methods such as the wavelet transform .",
    "for each fixed value @xmath24 , for each morse wavelet , we define two extra real functions to complement the isotropic morse wavelets .",
    "the triplet of real valued functions form a monogenic signal @xcite .",
    "two of the triplet of functions should be thought of as a single vector valued object , where their vector structure characterises the orientation of the local variations .",
    "the monogenic wavelets and wavelet transform are best represented using quaternion @xcite , rather than , real or complex numbers .",
    "each triplet is therefore considered as a positive real valued amplitude , a pure unit quaternion specifying a direction , and a phase .",
    "the real amplitude characterises a local energy , the pure unit quaternion an orientation , and the phase a local variational structure @xcite .",
    "the quaternion algebra allows for easy parameterisation of phase and orientation structure .",
    "+ in one dimension analytic wavelets , _ i.e. _ cauchy or morlet wavelets @xcite , are used to identify local oscillatory structure , of a real image @xmath25 the monogenic morse wavelets are the natural two - dimensional extension of the analytic morse wavelets @xcite , and they define a local phase and orientation structure at each spatial / spatial scale point for a two dimensional oscillatory image , yielding a natural , and more elegant , structure for wavelet ridge analysis @xcite .",
    "oscillatory images are the complements of discontinuous images , where the two kinds of images appear as either oscillatory or discontinuous depending on if they are analysed in the fourier or spatial domain .",
    "we consider line , or curved , discontinuities that may locally be thought of as one dimensional structures , and discuss the retrieval of their local features .",
    "analyses using the separable discrete wavelet transform in addition with local phase structure characterisations , have been previously considered @xcite .",
    "however , in contrast to their procedure , we define _ multiple orthogonal continuous _ wavelets , based on a different two dimensional extension to the analytic signal . the morse wavelets are additionally optimally concentrated with respect to a radial position / scale region @xmath26 other quaternion valued decompositions includes the work of @xcite , however this decomposition is only suitable for deterministic images .",
    "+ we briefly discuss the discrete implementation of the two dimensional monogenic morse wavelet transform , and in more depth the statistical properties of the transform .",
    "unavoidably , most observed signals are contaminated by noise , and so robust methods that can deal with noise must be designed .",
    "as the operator problem yields solutions of multiple orthogonal monogenic wavelets , we may use the notion of averaging uncorrelated estimates @xcite to retrieve estimates of the space - scale energy as well as other quantities of the image with reduced variance .",
    "multiple orthogonal filters have been considered in several dimensions for stationary processes @xcite , and non - stationary processes @xcite using the windowed fourier transform and tensor product windows , but our wavelets are in contrast to these methods orthogonal , _ non - separable monogenic _",
    "wavelet functions .",
    "finally , the methods are illustrated on typical examples , showing the power of the multiple monogenic morse wavelets .",
    "we denote the 1d fourier transform of @xmath27 @xmath28 and the two dimensional fourier transform of @xmath14 as @xmath29 we denote an arbitrary quaternion via @xmath30 where @xmath31 and note that @xmath32 whilst @xmath33 @xmath34 and finally @xmath35 the algebra is non - abelian .",
    "we additionally define the two dimensional fourier transform in terms of any unit quaternion as @xmath36 so that the regular fourier transform corresponds to @xmath37 for more notes on quaternion algebra see @xcite .",
    "we retain here only the briefest possible usage of the quaternion algebra , necessary for clarity of exposition , and stress that all implementation is discussed in terms of real vector quantities .",
    "the rotation operation is implemented using matrix @xmath38 we shall extensively use polar coordinates , and define : @xmath39,$ ] @xmath40,$ ] and @xmath41.$ ]",

    "the translated and dilated wavelets are chosen in one dimension to be mainly supported near time point @xmath5 and frequency point @xmath46 and the obvious extension to two dimensions would be to find functions that are mainly supported at spatial point @xmath44 and spatial frequency point @xmath47.$ ] to measure the localisation of a given wavelet function , commonly its spread in time and frequency or scale is calculated , and both quantities are desired to be low  their product is bounded below , thus restricting possible joint localisation .",
    "a function s spread in time and frequency should be considered simultaneously in the two domains @xcite , rather than combining two separate marginal properties : for this purpose localisation operators were defined , denoted @xmath48 the localisation of a function @xmath49 to region @xmath50 is measured by the ratio of energy @xmath51 and the eigenfunctions of @xmath52 achieve optimal ratios @xcite . naturally extending analysis to two dimensions",
    "requires the appropriate definition of a two - dimensional localisation operator .",
    "we consider localisation in scale and spatial location , which requires localisation in radial spatial frequencies of spatially radial functions , as we wish to associate a notion of distance to the cartesian two dimensional metric .",
    "this produces functions optimally concentrated in a radial space and scale @xmath7 but that have no orientation .",
    "we then construct a set of functions capable of extracting local orientation information based on the monogenic signal @xcite .",
    "@xcite have shown that with an appropriate definition of scale , orientation and spatial spread , the orientation and scale may be considered separately when finding optimally concentrated functions . in a slightly different setting",
    "they demonstrate that radial functions have optimal scale versus position localisation properties , for appropriately chosen families of functions .",
    "this , in combination with a cartesian metric in the plane , motivates the study of radial localisation .",
    "the construction of a coherent radial state , required for the construction of a radial projection operator , is not straightforward .",
    "we commence with radial function @xmath53 and in theory wish to construct a family of radial functions that have been shifted in scale and position .",
    "obviously this is impossible , as once we shift in position , we no longer have a radial function , but we may relax our requirements as the family only needs to act in a similar fashion to a direction averaged spatial shift , based on an appropriate domain @xmath50 chosen . to construct a generic two - dimensional non - radial coherent state we would use the full set of parameters @xmath54,$ ] but intend to use the sub - set @xmath55.$ ] working with radial functions the act of rotation , represented by @xmath45 will have little importance , and is not included .",
    "the dilation by @xmath4 will act correspondingly in the world of radial operations , to one dimensional analysis , and a substitute for a shift in position by @xmath44 must be defined .",
    "we reconstruct the function using building blocks of @xmath56 that are averaged over suitably defined domains .",
    "the localisation domain will be defined in terms of @xmath5 and range over @xmath57 this implies that any shift in @xmath44 will be averaged over the full range of @xmath58 and so rather than multiplying @xmath59 by @xmath60 we could multiply this by its angular average of @xmath61 that after implementing the operator projection , yields the same results as the former strategy .",
    "unfortunately , this choice of coherent state leads to a mathematically intractable operator , and so we define a radial coherent state for @xmath62 and @xmath63 that has similar properties to the suggested state via @xmath64 based on the morse coherent state @xcite of @xmath65 note that @xmath66 for @xmath67 and for future reference define @xmath68 in equation ( [ cohhy2 ] ) the dilation of @xmath4 is implemented as in @xcite and requires no further discussion .",

    "<S> we find the eigenfunctions of this operator and thus define a non - separable orthogonal set of radial wavelet functions that may be considered optimally concentrated over a region of radial space and radial scale space , defined via a doublet of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we give analytic forms to their energy concentration over this region . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the radial function localisation operator can be generalised to an operator , localising any @xmath0 function . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the latter operator , with an appropriate choice of localisation region , approximately has the same eigenfunctions as the radial operator . </S>",
    "<S> + based on the radial wavelets we define a set of quaternionic valued wavelet functions that can extract local orientation for discontinuous signals and both orientation and phase structure for oscillatory signals . </S>",
    "<S> the full set of quaternionic wavelet functions are component wise orthogonal ; hence their statistical properties are tractable , and we give forms for the variability of the estimates of the local phase and orientation , as well as the local energy of the image . by averaging estimates across wavelets , a substantial reduction in the variance is achieved .    </S>",
