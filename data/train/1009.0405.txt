    "common chronic diseases , such as cardiovascular diseases , are a major public health problem and consume large amounts of scarce healthcare resources @xcite . in order to use limited healthcare resources to best effect for local populations ,",
    "there is a need for decision - support tools when considering different medical and public health approaches to chronic diseases .",
    "this is a complex area beyond the information resources of most healthcare commissioning organisations .",
    "so we consider how commissioners might explore the potential impacts of different policy options via a flexible and accessible model .",
    "in particular , we shall present a coronary heart disease ( chd ) simulation model that is both flexible and useful to commissioners and providers .",
    "we build a discrete event simulation model that accounts for the population evolution over time to better understand the process behind chd .",
    "ideally , the model would be inferred from complete longitudinal data for a relevant population via a likelihood or bayesian approach .",
    "unfortunately , such data is not readily available and innovative ways are needed to combine information from different sources . therefore , a graph representation and survival analysis methods have been combined with a novel application of simulated annealing in order to learn the temporally dependent distributions of the model .",
    "our work incorporates and extends several aspects of previous chronic disease modelling approaches .",
    "the impact i model @xcite was the case study for the model described in this paper .",
    "it is a population - level , spreadsheet - based model using simple epidemiological and economics methods to estimate the number of deaths prevented or postponed ( dpp ) .",
    "the model is theoretically simple , and has undergone extensive validation , highlighting limitations that gave rise to the work presented here .",
    "similar to our model , the weinstein model , @xcite , is divided into a population health ( primary - side ) and a patient disease module ( secondary - side ) .",
    "the weinstein model also includes a _ bridge _ module which controls an individual s fate in the first 30 days after developing chd . despite being a relatively old , discrete time model ,",
    "this is one of the more sophisticated in this field .",
    "similar to the weinstein model , the chd life expectancy model considers individuals in discrete time .",
    "it is , however , less sophisticated that the weinstein model in the sense that there are fewer states and the time periods are fixed .",
    "closest to our modelling approach is the chd policy analysis model @xcite .",
    "again , it is divided in to a primary side and a secondary side , with model parameter estimates derived directly from the literature .",
    "the archimedes model is a micro - simulation model , which simulates patients to a high level of detail by focusing on the underlying pathophysiological processes that determine disease @xcite .",
    "the model has predicted the outcomes of notable clinical trials well , and has significant potential generalisability .",
    "archimedes is closed proprietary work , therefore it is not possible to examine the details of the model implementation .",
    "this is concerning given the model complexity and the public health interest involved .",
    "an epidemiological review of chd policy models is given in @xcite .",
    "this document is structured as follows . in section  [ section : background ] , the mathematical preliminaries are given .",
    "then , in section  [ section : model_description ] we describe how these ideas are used to build the general policy model",
    ". section  [ section : baseline ] then specifies a baseline scenario and the context of the paucity of relevant data available . in section  [ section :",
    "fitness ] , we explain how the model is fit in light of the data .",
    "section  [ section : interventions ] investigates how the model is modified under certain interventions .",
    "section  [ section : example ] applies the approach to a specific motivating chd example .",
    "finally , sections  [ section : discussion ] and [ section : conclusions ] summarise and draw conclusions with ideas for future work .",
    "in this section , we introduce existing theory and define the notation necessary for the subsequent sections .    letting @xmath0 denote event time ,",
    "a hazard function is defined as a limiting probability , @xmath1 further , consider collections of _ competing _ hazards or causes of failure , indexed by integers 1 to @xmath2 and with corresponding latent failure times @xmath3 .",
    "the _ marginal hazard _ is defined as the hazard of event @xmath4 occurring , ignoring the possibility that another event @xmath5 may have occurred first .",
    "suppose that each event has an associated marginal hazard function given by @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "calculation of the overall hazard assumes independence between the competing hazards .",
    "specifically , this is , ` the time of failure from cause @xmath8 under one set of study conditions in which all @xmath2 causes are operative is precisely the same as under an altered set of conditions in which all causes except the @xmath9 have been removed ' @xcite .",
    "from ( [ eqn : general_hazard ] ) , the marginal hazards are defined as @xmath10 the first failure occurs at time @xmath11 . let the corresponding cause of failure at time @xmath0 be denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "then , we are interested in the joint distribution of @xmath13 .",
    "note that we do not observe the full set of failure times @xmath3 , we only observe the one actual failure time @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , if we had real data , it would not be possible to estimate the model @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is impossible to identify the dependence structure from data . on the other hand ,",
    "any collection of competing hazards with any dependence structure can be generated from a related collection of independent competing hazards @xcite .",
    "a _ sub - hazard _ distribution ( also known in the literature as a cause - specific hazard ) will be of central importance .",
    "the sub - hazard distribution describes the hazard of failing specifically from a given cause ( rather than any of the competing causes ) . from  ( [ eqn : general_hazard ] ) , this is defined as @xmath14 finally , under independence of competing hazards , the _ overall hazard _ is given by @xmath15 the difference between the sub - hazard and the marginal hazard is that the marginal hazard describes the failure from a particular cause _ ignoring any other causes _ , in contrast to the sub - hazard which describes the failure from a particular cause _ rather than any other cause_. under independent competing hazards , though , these are equal in distribution , @xmath16 .    in the interest of brevity , for the remainder of this paper ,",
    "the  sub \" superscripts will be suppressed and we will assume reference to the sub - distributions , sub - densities and sub - hazards unless otherwise stated .",
    "the model is constructed as a graph consisting of edges @xmath17 and vertices @xmath18 , which represents possible states and transitions between states .",
    "we shall fix the vertices ( states ) and edges ( possible transitions ) in advance .",
    "the graph is used as a framework for a discrete event simulator such that for each individual a sequence of events , from a possible set of events defined by the graph , occur chronologically @xcite .",
    "the topology of the graph determines that competing risks exist .",
    "further , this can be thought of as a multi - state model , an extension of the standard competing risks model @xcite .",
    "revisiting a previous state is possible , so loops in the graph may exist .",
    "a subset of states are specified as entry states , where an individual has presented with chd symptoms , and another ( possibly overlapping ) subset of states are defined as sink states , corresponding here to death events .",
    "a continuous time multi - state model is developed here , which allows higher fidelity simulation and more flexible , realistic intervention policies than a discrete time analogue .",
    "the hazard functions used in this model are combinations ( or mixtures ) of @xmath19 component hazard functions , @xmath20 using a mixture hazard function enables us to better fit the model to data .",
    "different individual hazard functions may have contrasting properties , so when combined together provide a flexible distribution .",
    "note that we can even think of the combinations of hazards as competing hazards themselves .",
    "the choice of the number of components in the mixture is part of the model fitting process .",
    "we shall assume that the mixture hazard function has the proportional hazards property ; that is , multiplying the hazard function by a constant leads to a hazard function of the same form .",
    "this will be exploited when interventions are included in the model .",
    "subsequently , we shall investigate different intervention strategies , but first we produce a baseline model which describes the current progression or trajectory of each individual .",
    "that is , we wish to describe the patient journeys under existing healthcare protocols .",
    "ideally , we would want to specify a natural progression baseline model where no healthcare interventions are made . however , this data is not available since whenever an individual presents with chd symptoms treatment is offered and rarely refused .    to determine the model , approximations to the true underlying functions",
    "have been produced from a range of data types from various different sources , and expert elicitation .",
    "these approximations are specified through edge and node _ constraints _ which are used in the model fitting process . in principle",
    ", these constraints may be specified on any of the ( sub- ) distribution , density , hazard or survival functions .",
    "we thus define a generic constraint function @xmath21 to include all of these , where the total number of constraints is @xmath22 , the constraint index is @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the initial time and @xmath25 is the time period .    in practice ,",
    "the majority of the constraints are specified on the sub - distribution functions . in this case , we assume that these approximate the transition probabilities , usually with time period of one year .",
    "the transition probabilities essentially constitute a discrete - time markov jump process .",
    "it is only acceptable to treat transition probabilities as sub - distribution functions if a reasonable amount of time is spent in each state . to this end",
    ", one - year transition probabilities are used in states that patients are expected to spend a considerable amount of time in , whilst shorter time periods are used in acute states .",
    "the sub - distribution constraints are usually generated at approximately ten year age intervals .",
    "for example , a constraint may be specified on the transition from state @xmath26 to @xmath27 as @xmath28 , with another constraint at @xmath29 , and so forth .",
    "we shall also assign different importances to each constraint by allocating a weight @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "this weight is designed to reflect the amount of data , or strength of opinion , upon which a given constraint is based .",
    "this section details how the constraints , derived from expert elicitation and data , are used to approximate underlying continuous functions .",
    "this is achieved through a novel application of simulated annealing and an established entropy measure derived from information theory .",
    "constraints can be thought of as a list of conditions that we wish the model to satisfy .",
    "define the generic fitted functions @xmath32 to be continuous functions on @xmath33 which assume some parametric form according to the modelling assumptions .",
    "for example , the fitted sub - hazard functions are of the form given in ( [ eqn : general_mixture ] ) and are defined on each edge .",
    "a constraint is satisfied exactly when @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "the model fitting procedure is a trade - off between satisfying a series of constraints , and conforming to a desired model structure .",
    "this can be thought of as a compromise between fit ( through the constraints ) and avoiding excessive complexity ( through specifying a simple model structure ) . for flexibility",
    ", there are separate models for males and females , which are fitted separately .",
    "suppose the fitted values for the constraints computed from the model @xmath36 are @xmath37 , @xmath35 .",
    "the dependence on the model @xmath36 is explicit here  if we change the model , the fitted values change also .",
    "we are required to specify a model space that we are allowed to work over ; call this model space @xmath38 , by which we mean @xmath39 we call a specific model @xmath36 , so each @xmath40 .",
    "the reason that the constraints can not usually be satisfied exactly is that the chosen mixture distribution usually has only four free parameters , and each mixture needs to satisfy more than four constraints .    in the model fitting procedure ,",
    "we want to find the optimal model @xmath41 , such that the difference between the supplied and fitted constraints are minimised , i.e. @xmath42{}{\\textrm{argmin } } \\sum_{j=1}^n w_j d \\left\\ { \\tilde{\\phi}^j(t_j,\\delta_j ) , \\widehat{\\phi}^j(t_j,\\delta_j)(m ) \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is chosen as the jensen - shannon distance measure .",
    "a simulated annealing algorithm is used to minimise the given criterion function .",
    "the fundamental idea is to change the scale , or temperature , to allow different moves on the surface of the objective function , thus avoiding being trapped in local minima @xcite .",
    "a detailed exposition of this application will appear in a companion paper .",
    "a step - by - step algorithm description is given in the appendix .",
    "an important reason for developing the model was to support the investigation of different intervention strategies in policy scenarios which can not be feasibly tested in the real world , due to population , financial , or ethical reasons .",
    "the model interventions affect patients indirectly , meaning that the results of a simulated intervention do not immediately alter the state of an individual but rather alter the probabilities of entering a given state .",
    "that is , an intervention , such as a change in medical treatment , is designed to alter the disease trajectory of a patient .",
    "the incorporation of an intervention is transparent .",
    "a given intervention has proportional hazards adjustments associated with it for transitions from one state to another .",
    "it is an assumption of the model that the adjustment in the hazard should be proportional .",
    "these are incorporated into the model by simply scaling up or down the marginal hazard function by the relevant amount .",
    "define this relative risk reduction by @xmath44 .",
    "each intervention has a given uptake level @xmath45 , which may depend on age and gender . upon entry to a state",
    ", an individual receives a given intervention with probability @xmath45 .    for example , suppose that an individual enters state acute myocardial infarction , ` ami ` .",
    "immediately , we decide whether any of the possible interventions will be applied .",
    "suppose there is only one intervention to consider , ` in hospital cpr ' .",
    "assume that we have _ a priori _ specified the proportion of the population that has this intervention in this state as @xmath45 .",
    "if the intervention is applied , let the auxiliary variable @xmath46 , otherwise @xmath47 .",
    "thus , sample @xmath48 $ ] and if @xmath49 then set @xmath46 and apply the intervention , otherwise do not apply the intervention and set @xmath47 . if we intervene , then suppose that the specified hazard adjustment factor for a transition ` ami ` @xmath50 ` chd death ` is @xmath51 .",
    "thus , we would have @xmath52 for that particular marginal hazard function",
    ".    the proportional hazard adjustment depending on a bernoulli random sample can be thought of in terms of a frailty model  @xcite , a natural extension to the basic cox model .",
    "the notion of a frailty model is a convenient way to introduce random effects in to the model .",
    "simply , frailty is an unobserved random proportionality factor that modifies the hazard function of an individual .",
    "thus , it is a way of transferring the random selection directly on to the hazard .",
    "we do not assume that the population is homogeneous but rather a heterogeneous sample , where different individuals have different hazards , in our case either adherent or not .",
    "the univariate frailty model is such that the hazard of an individual depends in addition on an unobservable random variable @xmath53 , which acts multiplicatively on the baseline hazard function .",
    "analogous to ( [ twostep_adjustment ] ) , @xmath54 in particular , we have the simple case where the relative risk adjustment only takes one of two values , so setting @xmath55bernoulli(@xmath45 ) we obtain @xmath56 the expect adjusted hazard @xmath57 = \\{1+p(\\eta-1)\\ } h_k^{\\textrm{old}}(t)$ ] .",
    "this can be thought of as the associated proportional adjustment combining the uptake probability and the relative risk .",
    "when the variance @xmath58 = \\{(\\eta - 1 ) h_k^{\\textrm{old}}(t)\\}^2 p(1-p)$ ] , is small or the population size is large then using @xmath57 $ ] may be more practical whilst not adversely affecting accuracy .",
    "in this section , we will give a chd example implementation with interventions .      figure  [ fig : secondary ]",
    "shows the graph structure and table [ tab : nodenamestable ] gives the node descriptions from this graph .",
    "for ease of exposition , we shall assume that both males and females have the same graphical structure .",
    "the graph can be described as follows : both death states ( ` non chd death ` and ` chd death ` ) can be caused by any non - death state .",
    "early heart failure ( ` early hf ` ) can be caused by unstable angina ( ` ua ` ) , chronic angina ( ` ca ` ) or various stages of myocardial infarction ( ` ami ` , ` mi surv ` , ` mi recur ` ) .",
    "unstable angina can recur after acute myocardial infarction , which itself can result from either chronic angina or sudden death ( ` sd ` ) , and so forth ."
