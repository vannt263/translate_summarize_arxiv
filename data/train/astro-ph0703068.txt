    "supernova 1987a ( sn  1987a ) confirmed our basic theoretical understanding of a type ii supernova ( sn  ii ) as the core collapse of a massive star , which leaves behind a compact object ( neutron star or black hole ) and expels the outer mantle and envelope into the interstellar medium ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . while the explosion mechanism itself remains a subject of active research , the propagation of the shock wave through the mantle and envelope is reasonably well understood .",
    "theoretical models for the light curve do a good job of reproducing the observations @xcite and detailed radiation transport calculations verify that these models reproduce the observed spectra from the uv to the ir @xcite .",
    "unlike type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) where the actual compositions as a function of velocity are an important subject of current research @xcite , the compositions of the envelopes of red or blue supergiant stars is primarily hydrogen and helium and thus we show that the primordial compositions can be determined by the detailed spectral modeling of observed sn  ii spectra .",
    "of particular interest is the effect of cno processing on the composition of the ejected material .",
    "sne  ii have a very large spread in their intrinsic brightness , from the very dim sn  1987a , to the exceedingly bright sne  1979c and 1997cy . the observed spread in intrinsic",
    "luminosity is greater than a factor of 500 .",
    "this is not surprising given the fact that the progenitors span a wide range of initial stellar masses , possible binary membership , and prior star formation histories . clearly , sne  ii do not meet the astronomers requirement of being a _ standard candle _ ; however , since our models determine the stellar compositions and total reddening this provides evidence that their atmospheres can be well understood .",
    "these results increase the attractiveness of sne  ii as cosmological probes and in the future sne  ii will become complementary with sne  ia as distance indicators .",
    "both the seam ( spectral - fitting expanding atmosphere method ) ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) methods for determining distances to sne  ii ( and other supernova types for seam ) depend on the ability to model the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the supernova atmosphere accurately .",
    "clearly , quantities like the composition and total reddening play a role in the output sed and thus the work presented here helps to place both these methods on firmer footing .    while the average sn  ii has a luminosity several times less than a typical sn  ia , current ground - based searches and proposed future space - based searches for supernovae will easily detect these objects at cosmologically interesting distances . using an empirical relation between brightness and expansion velocity on the plateau portion of the light curve @xcite",
    "were able to construct a hubble diagram using 5 sne  ii out to a redshift @xmath0 .",
    "the explosion mechanism is thought to result in a non - spherically symmetric shock - wave ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and this has been confirmed by the detection of significant polarization in the spectra of sne  ii @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the large expansion of the ejecta before the supernova becomes visible leads to significant `` sphericalization '' @xcite , and asphericity effects may only be important at late times , or in sne  ii that are strong circumstellar interacters ( sne  iin ) .",
    "these supernovae are observationally clearly distinguishable from `` normal '' type ii supernovae .",
    "calculations @xcite indicate that sne  ii may in fact be the first stellar objects visible in the universe and hence they serve as important probes for the star formation rate , the rate of chemical evolution by measuring their primordial abundances , and directly for the cosmological parameters .",
    "we show that the primordial abundances of the progenitor star can be determined by detailed synthetic spectral modeling . in this work",
    "we do not seek to determine exact nucleosynthetic yields , but rather show that this is feasible given a large grid of models that will become available as more supernovae are analyzed and as computational resources become more plentiful .",
    "we have chosen to model sn  2005cs in detail because there are several high signal to noise spectra and @xmath1 photometry very near the time of explosion as well as at later times .",
    "sn  2005cs was discovered in m51 ( ngc  5194 ) on 2005 june 28.905 @xcite , the earliest detection was that of m.  fiedler on 2005 june 27.91 @xcite and nothing was visible on june 20.6 @xcite .",
    "moreover no other detections were found on june 26 by other amateur observers @xcite , thus the explosion date is known to within about 1 day . using the rather long distance of (",
    "* see below ) , @xcite classified sn  2005cs as moderately under - luminous compared to typical sne  iip and in the class of sn  1997d and sn  1999br .",
    "in addition a progenitor has been identified for sn  2005cs @xcite with a mass of about 10  @xmath2 .",
    "the calculations were performed using the multi - purpose stellar atmospheres program ` phoenix `  version 14 @xcite . `",
    "phoenix `  solves the radiative transfer equation along characteristic rays in spherical symmetry including all special relativistic effects .",
    "the non - lte ( nlte ) rate equations for many ionization states are solved including the effects of ionization due to non - thermal electrons from the @xmath3-rays produced by the radiative decay of @xmath4ni , which is produced in the supernova explosion .",
    "the atoms and ions calculated in nlte are : h  i , he  i  ii , c  i - iii , n  i - iii , o  i - iii , ne  i , na  i - ii , mg  i - iii , si  i  iii , s  i  iii , ca  ii , ti  ii , fe  i  iii , ni  i - iii , and co  ii",
    ". these are all the elements whose features make important contributions to the observed spectral features in sne  ii .",
    "each model atom includes primary nlte transitions , which are used to calculate the level populations and opacity , and weaker secondary lte transitions which are included in the opacity and implicitly affect the rate equations via their effect on the solution to the transport equation @xcite .",
    "in addition to the nlte transitions , all other lte line opacities for atomic species not treated in nlte are treated with the equivalent two - level atom source function , using a thermalization parameter , @xmath5 .",
    "the atmospheres are iterated to energy balance in the co - moving frame ; while we neglect the explicit effects of time dependence in the radiation transport equation , we do implicitly include these effects , via explicitly including the rate of gamma - ray deposition in the generalized equation of radiative equilibrium and in the rate equations for the nlte populations .",
    "the models are parameterized by the time since explosion and the velocity ( @xmath6 ) where the continuum optical depth in extinction at 5000  ( @xmath7 ) is unity , which along with the density profile determines the radii .",
    "this follows since the explosion becomes homologous ( @xmath8 ) quickly after the shock wave traverses the entire star . the density profile is taken to be a power - law in radius : @xmath9 where @xmath10 typically is in the range @xmath11",
    ". since we are only modeling the outer atmosphere of the supernova , this simple parameterization agrees well with detailed simulations of the light curve @xcite for the relatively small regions of the ejecta that our models probe .",
    "further fitting parameters are the model temperature @xmath12 , which is a convenient way of parameterizing the total luminosity in the observer s frame .",
    "we treat the @xmath3-ray deposition in a simple parameterized way , which allows us to include the effects of nickel mixing which is seen in nearly all sne  ii .",
    "detailed fitting of a time series of the observed spectra determines all the parameters .",
    "determining the extinction to sne  ii is difficult , since they are such a heterogeneous class , it is difficult to find an intrinsic feature in the spectrum or light curve that can be used to find the parent galaxy extinction .",
    "@xcite found that the ca ii h+k lines can be used as a temperature indicator in modeling very early observed spectra .",
    "this suggests that detailed modeling of sne  iip spectra can be used to determine the total reddening to the supernova . for sn  2005cs",
    "the reddening has been estimated in a variety of ways .",
    "@xcite used the relationship between the equivalent width of the na  i  d interstellar absorption line to obtain a color excess of @xmath13 , as well as the color magnitude diagram of red supergiants within 2 arcsec of sn  2005cs to obtain @xmath14 , and their final adopted @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite noted the large scatter in the relationships for equivalent width of the na  i  d line , obtaining a range of @xmath16 .",

    "d line @xcite found @xmath17 , but noting the uncertainty and comparing with the work of other authors they adopted @xmath18 .",
    "we began our work by adopting the reddening estimate of @xcite , since our spectra were obtained from these authors .",
    "figure  [ fig : t18_ebmv11 ] ( top panel ) shows our best fit using solar abundances @xcite where the observed spectrum has been dereddened using the reddening law of @xcite and @xmath19 .",
    "figure  [ fig : t18_ebmv11 ] ( bottom panel ) shows the same for the case of cno enhanced abundances @xcite . from the figure it is evident that the region around h@xmath20  is very poorly fit",
    ", there is a strong feature just to the blue of h@xmath20  and h@xmath20  itself is far too weak .",
    "we attempted to alter the model in a number of ways , changing the density profile , velocity at the photosphere , and gamma - ray deposition in order to strengthen h@xmath20 , however we were unable to find any set of parameters that would provide a good fit to h@xmath20  ( and the rest of the observed spectrum ) with this choice of reddening .",
    "these models have = 18000  k , @xmath6= 6000  @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . after careful analysis the strong feature too the blue of h@xmath20is due to c  iii and n  iii lines that become strong at these high temperatures .",
    "figure  [ fig : t12_ebmv035 ] shows that if  is reduced to 12000  k and the color excess is reduced to the galactic foreground value of @xmath23 @xcite the fit is significantly improved .",
    "our value of @xmath23 is in agreement within the errors of the lower values found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "clearly , the na d interstellar absorption indicates that there was some dust in the host galaxy , but we have chosen the value that gave the best fit for this epoch which was no dust extinction in the host galaxy . given our modeling uncertainties , @xmath24 , but we will adopt the value of 0.035 for the rest of this work . note that this lower value of the extinction will somewhat lower the inferred mass of the progenitor found by @xcite and @xcite , but other uncertainties such as distance and progenitor metallicity also play important roles in the uncertainty of the progenitor mass .",
    "comparing with the published results , the difference due to our distance and reddening estimates on the value of the progenitor mass obtained is quite small .",
    "using the value of @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite the change in @xmath27 is @xmath28  mag and @xmath29  mag .",
    "our derived distance is consistant with that adopted by @xcite and only somewhat smaller than that of @xcite .",
    "clearly the bluest part of the continuum is better fit with the = 18000  k models than with the = 12000  k models .",
    "we did not attempt to fine tune our results to perfectly fit the bluest part of the continuum since the flux calibration at the spectral edges is difficult and it represents our uncertainty in   and @xmath30 .",
    "none of the above models have he  i @xmath31 strong enough .",
    "it is well known that rayleigh - taylor instabilities lead to mixing between the hydrogen and helium shells thus our helium abundance is almost certainly too low , but we will not explore helium mixing further in this work .    . the observed spectrum on jul 02 , 2005 is compared to a model spectrum using solar abundances ( top panel ) and cno enhanced abundances ( bottom panel ) . the observed spectrum has been dereddened using @xmath18 . in this and",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) as well as the work of mazzali and collaborators ( for example * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , line identifications do not provide direct information on abundances , which are what are input into stellar evolution calculations and output from hydrodynamical calculations of supernova explosions and nucleosynthesis .",
    "line identifications are subject to error in that there may be another candidate line that is not considered in the analysis or there may be two equally valid possible identifications , the classic being he  i @xmath31 and",
    "na  i d , which have very similar rest wavelengths and are both expected in supernovae ( and have both been identified in supernovae ) .    here we focus on nitrogen and sodium .",
    "massive stars which are the progenitors of sne  ii are expected to undergo cno processing at the base of the hydrogen envelope followed by mixing due to dredge up and meridional circulation .",
    "this would lead to enhanced nitrogen and sodium and depleted carbon and oxygen . for our cno processed models",
    "we take the abundances used by @xcite .",
    "however , significant mixing of the hydrogen and helium envelope is expected to occur during the explosion due to rayleigh - taylor instabilities and mass loss will occur during the pre - supernova evolution .",
    "studies of the evolution of massive stars show that for an 11  @xmath2  model the mass fractions of cno are very close to solar , with significantly less depletion of carbon and oxygen than is obtained from cno processing ( a.  chieffi & m.  tavani , 2006 , in preparation ) . a detailed study of sn  2005cs spectra using the results of these hydro models will be a sensitive test of the predictions of stellar evolution theory .      in detailed line - blanketed models such as the ones presented here",
    "line identifications are difficult since nearly every feature in the model spectrum is a blend of many individual weak and strong lines .",
    "nevertheless , it is useful to attempt to understand just what species are contributing to the variations in the spectra . in order to do this",

    "this method suffers from uncertainties in determining the dilution factors , the difficulty of knowing which lines to use as velocity indicators , uncertainties between color temperatures and effective temperatures , and questions of how to match the photospheric radius used in the models to determine the dilution factor and the radius of the line forming region @xcite . in spite of this",
    "the epm method was successfully applied to sn  1987a in the lmc @xcite which led to hopes that the epm method would lead to accurate distances , independent of other astronomical calibrators .",
    "recently , the epm method was applied to the very well observed sn  iip 1999em @xcite .",
    "all three groups found a distance of 7.58.0  mpc .",
    "@xcite subsequently used _ hst _ to obtain a cepheid distance to the parent galaxy of sn  1999em , ngc 1637 , and found @xmath53  mpc , a value 50% larger than that obtained with epm .",
    "@xcite calculated updated values for the dilution factor and found good agreement with the cepheid distance using epm , but emphasized that dilution factors would have to be calculated for each supernova individually . using seam @xcite found a distance to sn  1999em of @xmath54  mpc .    with modern detailed nlte radiative transfer codes ,",
    "accurate synthetic spectra of all types of supernovae can be calculated .",
    "the * * s**pectral - fitting * * e**xpanding * * a**tmosphere * * m**ethod ( seam , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was developed using the generalized stellar atmosphere code ` phoenix ` ( for a review of the code see * ? ? ?",
    "while seam is similar to epm in spirit , it avoids the use of dilution factors and color temperatures .",
    "velocities are determined accurately by actually fitting synthetic and observed spectra .",
    "the radius is still determined by the relationship @xmath55 , ( which is an excellent approximation because all supernovae quickly reach homologous expansion ) and the explosion time is found by demanding self consistency . seam uses all the spectral information available in the observed spectra simultaneously which broadens the base of parameter determination .",
    "since the spectral energy distribution is known completely from the calculated synthetic spectra , one may calculate the absolute magnitude , @xmath56 , in any photometric band @xmath57 , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the response of filter @xmath57 , @xmath60 is the luminosity per unit wavelength , and @xmath61 is the zero point of filter @xmath57 determined from standard stars .",
    "then one immediately obtains a distance modulus @xmath62 , which is a measure of the distance @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the apparent magnitude in band @xmath57 , @xmath65 is the extinction due to dust along the line of sight both in the host galaxy and in our own galaxy , and @xmath66 is the k - correction @xcite . the seam method does not need to invoke a blackbody assumption or to calculate dilution factors .",
    "we calculate a seam distance to sn  2005cs using our first two early dates , day 5 and day 17 , since our best fit to day 34 was contradictory in that the photosphere moved out and the density slope was different at a previous time . with only two days we do nt have much leverage on the time of explosion , thus we adopt the explosion time of @xcite . using 5 photometric bands @xmath1 and our adopted reddening of @xmath23 we find @xmath67 which corresponds to a distance of @xmath68  mpc where the error is just the formal @xmath69 error and does not include systematic error . using the epm method @xcite found @xmath70  mpc , and using a standard candle method @xcite they found @xmath71  mpc . using the seam method on sn  1994i a type ic that is also in m51 we found @xmath72  mpc @xcite .",
    "given that sne  ic are much more difficult to model than sne  ii , the fact that the two seam results agree within the errors is strong evidence that not only is the seam method robust , but the errors can be reasonably well estimated .",
    "@xcite summarize the other distance estimates obtained to m51 and find an average value of @xmath73  mpc .",
    "given the wide range of distances obtained and the relative closeness of m51 , an effort should be made to obtain a cepheid distance to m51 .",
    "we have calculated a small grid of simple parameterized explosion models for sn  2005cs .",
    "we have shown that the reddening estimated in previous studies is likely too high and we adopted the lowest possible value , that of foreground reddening alone .",
    "additionally we have shown that while there is evidence for enhanced nitrogen and sodium as would be expected from cno processing in the pre - supernova envelope , the specific set of abundances that we adopted were too depleted in oxygen to match the observed spectrum .",
    "we have not attempted to exhaust the full parameter space and determine exact abundances in this work , merely to show that such an approach is feasible given sufficient computational resources . additionally , we had trouble obtaining a physically plausible fit to the final epoch we studied , 34 days past explosion .",
    "all of these shortcomings point that a better approach would be to run large grids using the best current stellar evolution models and compare the results to many well - observed sne  iip",
    ". this should be feasible in the near future . using the seam method we obtained a distance to m51 which is somewhat larger than the accepted distance .",
    "the seam method has been shown to be reliable in modeling sne  iip and our result is reliable enough that it should be calibrated with a cepheid distance to m51 .",
    "this could then be compared with the results from a larger more homogeneous grid .",
