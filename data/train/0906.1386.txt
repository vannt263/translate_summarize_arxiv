    "@xcite specifically to improve the poor integrated @xmath25 , @xmath28 convergence , are displayed in fig .",
    "the @xmath14-instability of the @xmath116 results is much greater than the theoretical uncertainty @xmath117 often quoted for the @xmath69 version of this analysis in the literature .",
    "the results corresponding to @xmath118 , in contrast , display a very good window of @xmath14-stability .",
    "a positive feature of the @xmath26 analysis is the fact that the results for all four weights appear to be converging towards the stable @xmath118 value as @xmath119 .",
    "the @xmath69 versions of the various analyses are @xmath120 where the first error is experimental ( dominated by @xmath34 spectral errors ) and the second the nominal theoretical error .",
    "the nominal theory error is obviously much smaller than the observed @xmath14-instability in the @xmath116 case , and hence unrealistically small .",
    "comparison to the results of earlier @xmath26 fesr analyses  @xcite shows the significant impact of recent , improved @xmath34 experimental results on the @xmath1 central values .",
    "the decreases represented by the remeasured @xmath34 branching fractions , lead to @xmath1 results @xmath2 below the 3-family - unitarity expectation , @xmath121  @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that several important strange decay modes have yet to be remeasured by either babar or belle , and that the level of consistency of the @xmath69 results for different weights could be significantly affected by such future remeasurements . as an illustration",
    ", we show , in figure  [ fig2 ] , the impact on @xmath1 as a function of @xmath14 of rescaling upward by @xmath122 the as - yet - unremeasured @xmath123 branching fraction , and hence also the @xmath123 component of the @xmath34 spectral distribution employed above . the issue of whether plausible shifts in the as - yet - unremeasured branching fractions are capable of restoring agreement with 3-family - unitarity expectations is less clear .",
    "in fact , it would take simultaneous @xmath122 upward rescalings of all currently unremeasured @xmath34 branching fractions to restore agreement .",
    "such a rescaling , moreover , does not produce a convincing @xmath14-stability plateau for any of the weights considered , as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] .    the results for @xmath1 for the @xmath48 fesrs based on @xmath112 , the weight @xmath115 displaying the best @xmath14-stability for the @xmath26 fesr , and the weights @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath126 , where @xmath127 , are displayed in fig .",
    "the weight @xmath128 produces a single surviving integrated @xmath129 ope contribution suppressed by the coefficient @xmath130 and scaling as @xmath109 , making it a useful choice in this case , where the slow integrated @xmath28 convergence found for the @xmath128 versions of the @xmath26 fesrs is no longer relevant .",
    "if it was poor @xmath28 convergence which was responsible for the @xmath14-instability of the @xmath116 @xmath26 fesr results , one would expect to see a much improved stability plateau for the corresponding @xmath48 fesr , as is indeed found .",
    "the very good stability for the @xmath128 results also indicates that the integrated @xmath131 contributions relevant to these cases become negligible in the upper part of the @xmath14 window displayed in the figure .",
    "since , however , @xmath108 contributions increase in going from @xmath26 to @xmath48  @xcite , one would expect the instability for weights like @xmath118 , which do not suppress these to the same extent as do the other weights considered , to be enhanced , as is indeed found to be the case .",
    "even so , the @xmath118 results converge well to the stable results for the other weights as @xmath119 .",
    "given the very good stability of the @xmath116 results , it is possible to quote a final result based on the @xmath69 version of the @xmath116 fesr , which allows us to take advantage of the improvements in the @xmath34 branching fraction errors .",
    "the result is @xmath132 where the first three errors are due to the uncertainties on the @xmath34 v+a , residual @xmath133 em and residual @xmath33 v / a spectral integrals , respectively , and the fourth is due to the @xmath28 and @xmath134 ope uncertainties ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) .",
    "we conclude by stressing that , for both the @xmath26 and @xmath48 fesrs , improved errors on @xmath67 are crucial .",
    "this requires both remeasurements of as - yet - unremeasured strange mode branching fractions , pursuit of higher multiplicity modes with branching fractions down to the few@xmath135 level , and , in particular , a full investigation of the @xmath136 and @xmath137 modes , which were not in fact measured , but rather estimated , in the earlier experimental analyses .    9 y .- s .",
