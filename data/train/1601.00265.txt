    "over the past few years , the majorana bound states ( mbss ) in topological superconductors ( tscs ) have attracted a lot of attention in the condensed matter research community@xcite .",
    "these exotic objects are basically the zero - energy quasiparticles which are the equal - amplitude superposition of particles and holes in tscs",
    ". one surprising characteristic of these mbss is that they obey non - abelian braiding statistics@xcite .",
    "furthermore , a widely separated pair of mbss forms a nonlocal fermionic state which is immune to local sources of decoherence .",
    "both features provide a potential for future applications in quantum computing and quantum information processes@xcite . up to now",
    ", there are several candidate systems that are promised to realize these mbss .",
    "typically , s - wave superconductors are put in proximity to other materials with strong spin - orbital coupling , in the presence or absence of external magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "there have already been several recent experiments investigating these kinds of systems@xcite .",
    "one way to reveal the existence of the mbss is through the @xmath0 ( or fractional ) josephson effect in a topological josephson junction@xcite , where the dc josephson current is a @xmath0-periodic function of the superconducting ( sc ) phase difference between the two tscs .",
    "this doubling of the period is tightly related to these zero - energy mbss .",
    "roughly speaking , the existence of zero - energy mbss allow the coherent single - particle tunneling between tscs . since the electron carries half of the sc phase , this results in the doubling of the period .",
    "however , in real experimental situations , there are many subtle effects , such as disorder , multiple bands , quasi - particle poisoning , coulomb charging energy for sc islands etc .",
    ", which have to be taken into account@xcite .",
    "therefore , it is extremely important to understand how this @xmath0 josephson effect survives these complications .",
    "there are several recent attempts in this research direction .",
    "for example , by coupling the topological josephson junction to an external normal - metal probe , the dynamics of the fermion - parity switch through the ejection of quasiparticles via the probe is analyzed in ref . . in ref",
    ", the effects of electromagnetic environments and an additional quantum dot ( qd ) on the charge transport between the tsc and a normal - metal lead are considered .",
    "interestingly , in the latter case , it is claimed that when two tscs are coupled via a qd , the resulting system is equivalent to a resonant - level model at low energy from which a coulomb oscillation in the conductance follows in both the weak and the strong tunneling regime .",
    "it is not clear how the josephson current , which is supposed to exist in the absence of the qd , is affected by the presence of the qd .",
    "the interesting situation where the tsc is coupled to a metallic lead through a qd has already been studied@xcite .",
    "there , the point is to analyze the competition between the andreev reflection and the coulomb blockade / kondo effect . in the present work",
    ", we would like to study the effects of coulomb blockade , introduced by a qd , on the dc josephson current .",
    "the tsc itself forms a ring with a gap , and the ring is threaded by a magnetic flux @xmath1 which determines the sc phase difference @xmath2 between the two ends of the tsc .",
    "the two ends of the tsc is coupled through a qd to form a tsc - qd - tsc junction .",
    "a schematic setup is shown in fig .",
    "we focus on the case where the bulk sc gap is the largest energy scale . in the weak tunneling limit",
    ", we consider the case where the dot is near the charge degeneracy point .",
    "this is because in this case the andreev spectrum , arising from the hybridization between the mbss at the ends of the tsc and the charge degrees of freedom of the qd , shows a simple structure , i.e. two andreev levels for each sector with fixed fermion parity .",
    "this results in a nontrivial current - phase relation with a @xmath0 periodicity .",
    "this simple structure of the andreev spectrum and its @xmath0 dependence on @xmath2 can be revealed as sharp peaks in the spectral function of the dot , which could be measured by stm@xcite or microwave - optical experiments@xcite .",
    "moreover , by changing the flux through the ring abruptly , the josephson current exhibits the behavior of rabi oscillation with the frequency being a @xmath0-periodic function of @xmath2 .",
    "this @xmath2 dependence of the rabi frequency is immune to quasiparticle poisoning . both features",
    ", the @xmath0 dependence of the peaks in the spectral function of the dot and the rabi frequency , can be viewed as the hallmark for the presence of the mbss . in the strong tunneling regime where the transmission between the qd and the sc electrodes is nearly perfect , the current - phase relation is the usual one , i.e. @xmath3 , provided that the fermion parity is conserved .",
    "we calculate the temperature and the gate - voltage dependence of the critical current @xmath4 by assuming that the temperature is much larger than the average level spacing in the dot .",
    "due to the coulomb charging energy of the dot , the backscattering at the interfaces between the qd and the sc electrodes is enhanced , which is revealed in the temperature dependence of @xmath4 .",
    "our main results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ sqdsi4 ] and [ sqdsi3 ] .    .",
    "the energy levels in the dot can be tuned by a capacitively coupled gate voltage @xmath5 .",
    "the couplings between the qd and the tsc can be adjusted by additional gate voltages , which are not shown in the figure . ]",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present our analysis on the andreev spectrum and the dc josephson current in the weak and the strong tunneling regimes in sec . [ weak ] and [ strong ] , respectively .",
    "the last section is devoted to a conclusive discussion .",

[ sqdsi4 ] .",
    "although our results hold only when @xmath77 , the dc josephson current already shows the oscillatory behaviour due to the charging energy .",
    "now we consider an abrupt change of the flux , i.e. @xmath98 and @xmath99 for @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "this amounts to giving an initial state , say @xmath102 , which is not the eigenstates of @xmath103 .",
    "we would like to calculate the resulting josephson current at @xmath101 .    the current operator @xmath104 is defined as @xmath105 with the choice of the initial state given above , the josephson current at @xmath74 for the sector with even fermion parity exhibits the behavior of rabi oscillation : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the current amplitude , @xmath108 is the rabi frequency , @xmath109 $ ] , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",

    "we would like to emphasize a few points on the above results .",
    "first of all , the josephson current will still exhibit the rabi oscillation even if the change of @xmath1 has a finite duration @xmath114 .",
    "the requirement is that @xmath115 .",
    "next , by taking into account the dissipation that we have ignored , the current will eventually decay into its equilibrium value given by eq .",
    "( [ sqdseq14 ] ) .",
    "however , the oscillatory behavior still exists before the equilibrium value is reached , and the frequency @xmath112 can be measured .",
    "finally , in the presence of quasiparticle poisoning , the states with even and odd fermion parity will both contribute to the josephson current .",
    "since the current operator @xmath104 commutes with the fermion - parity operator , the contributions from the states with different fermion parity will not mix , i.e. no interference appearing in the josephson current .",
    "therefore , the resulting current still exhibits an oscillatory behavior with two rabi frequencies @xmath112 and @xmath116 , where @xmath117 . both are @xmath0-periodic functions of @xmath2 . in this sense",
    ", the dependence of the rabi frequencies on @xmath2 is immune to quasiparticle poisoning .",
    "now we turn into the strong tunneling regime , i.e. @xmath118 or @xmath119 , where @xmath120 denotes the transmission coefficient of the left ( right ) contact . in this case",
    ", the dot is connected to the sc electrodes through a narrow constriction .",
    "we assume that the width of the constriction at its center allows only a single transverse state below the fermi level .",

    "the andreev spectrum becomes simple near the degenerate point of the qd .",
    "this simple structure should appear as sharp peaks in the spectral function of the dot , which could be observed by established experimental techniques .",
    "we also consider the abrupt change of the flux , which results in a rabi oscillation of the josephson current with frequencies being @xmath0-periodic functions of @xmath2 . we indicate that this feature is immune to the quasiparticle poisoning . far away from the degenerate point",
    ", the proliferation of andreev levels will complicate the behavior of the josephson current .",
    "therefore , we do not consider such a situation .",
    "we notice that the use of the rabi oscillation to extract the signature of the mbss has been proposed in a different setup@xcite . in that case ,",
    "the qd is side - coupled to one end of the tsc in a josephson junction , and it is the electron occupation of the dot which exhibits the rabi oscillation due to the dc josephson current .    in the strong - tunneling regime , we model the dot and the contacts as a one - dimensional electron liquid , following the work on the charge transport through an open qd@xcite . using the bosonization",
    ", we may calculate the free energy and the dc josephson current in a perturbative expansion in the reflection amplitudes .",
    "the resulting current - phase relation is of the form @xmath304 , identical to the short josephson junction .",
    "the difference lies at the critical current @xmath4 , which acquires a nontrivial dependence on the temperature and the gate voltage . in the absence of the backscattering terms",
    ", the critical current we obtained is identical to the one for the long topological sns junction in the temperature range @xmath188@xcite .    in the absence of the charging energy @xmath148 ,",
    "the low - energy effective hamiltonian is identical to the one for the long topological sns junction@xcite .",
    "the role of the charging energy is to enhance the effects of the backscattering at the contacts on low - energy properties .",
    "this has been shown in the study of the charge transport through the open qd@xcite . there , the backscattering terms become relevant perturbations and a non - perturbative method is warranted . in the present case , thanks to the superconductivity in the bulk , the backscattering terms turn into a marginal perturbation , and a perturbative expansion works .    in the weak tunneling regime , we only consider the case near the degenerate point of the qd so that only two levels of the dot are involved .",
    "it is interesting to study how the andreev spectrum and the resulting current - phase relation evolve upon moving far away from the degenerate point . on the other hand , our results in the strong tunneling regime",
    "hold only for @xmath188 .",
    "thus , the dc josephson effect at the temperature range @xmath305 requires further study .",
    "finally , as our analysis suggests , the current - phase relation of the tsc - qd - tsc junction depends on the transmission coefficients @xmath144 of the contacts .",
    "since the control of the critical current is important for the basic elements in large - scale integrated sc circuits@xcite , the dependence of the current - phase relation on @xmath144 is deserved to investigate .",
