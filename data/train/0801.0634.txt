    "in the classical theory of structure formation , it was generally believed that the gravity is fully responsible for the formation and evolution of the large scale structure in the universe .",
    "recently , however , it has been realized that the overall characteristics of the large scale structures can not be understood only in terms of the gravitational influence .",
    "it has been pointed out that the tidal field provides a driving force in establishing the observed large scale filamentary structures in the universe @xcite .",
    "the cosmic voids are most vulnerable to the tidal influence from the surrounding matter distribution due to their extreme low - density @xcite .",
    "the tidal squeezing and distortion effect tends to deviate the void shapes from spherical symmetry and could sometimes lead even to the collapse and disappearance of the voids @xcite .",
    "the presence of the filamentary structures in voids marks the most striking evidence for the strong tidal influence on voids .",
    "the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of void halos is induced by their alignments with the principal axes of the tidal tensors @xcite .",
    "since the void halos evolve very little and most particles remain primordial in voids @xcite , the void mini - filaments are pristine , keeping well the initial memory of the spatial coherence of the primordial tidal effect , unlike the large scale filaments which also originated from the large - scale coherence of the primordial tidal field but have undergone highly nonlinear processes in the subsequent evolution .",
    "hence , the void filaments are the most idealistic probe of the primordial tidal field and its effect on voids",
    ".    the size distribution of void filaments should be a function of the strength of the tidal effect and the host void sizes .",
    "the maximum size of a void filament can not exceed the size of its host void .",
    "but , even when a host void has a large size , it would not have long - size filaments if there is no tidal influence . here",
    ", we attempt to derive the size distributions of the void filaments at various redshifts and to explore their statistical properties . before presenting our results ,",
    "however , we would like to caution the readers for the difficulty in using the void filaments as a probe of the primordial tidal field .",
    "unlike the galaxy clusters , there is no unique way to define voids and their filaments .",
    "recently , the seminal work of @xcite compared thoroughly various void - finding algorithms and showed clearly that different void finders different void characteristics , under - density profiles , void galaxies etc",
    ". thus , our results are likely to be dependent on our specific choice of the void - finder .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ void ] , we briefly describe the void catalog was obtained from the millennium run simulations . in  [ filament ] , we explain how the void filaments are identified from the void catalog . in  [ result ] , we derive numerically the size distributions of void filaments and determine an analytic fitting formula for it . in ",
    "[ end ] , we discuss the final results and assess the future work .",
    "in our previous work @xcite , we have obtained a sample of voids at four different redshifts , @xmath5 and @xmath1 , from the millennium run simulation @xcite for a flat @xmath6cdm cosmology with the key cosmological parameters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , which we use throughout this paper . here",
    ", we briefly summarize the void - identification process as an overview .     vs. the minimum void - size threshold @xmath13 at @xmath5 and @xmath1.,width=317 ]    we first selected those halos in the millennium data which consist of more than @xmath14 particles since those halos composed of less than @xmath14 halos are statistically unreliable ( in private communication with v. springel ) .",
    "beside , it is interestingly found that when the particle number threshold of @xmath15 is used , the statistical properties of the halo voids are quite similar to that of the galaxy voids from the millennium sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) mock catalog with the magnitude completeness limit .",
    "we applied the void - finding algorithm developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hv02 ) to the sample of the selected halos at each redshift , separately .",
    "to apply the hv02 algorithm , it is required first to set the values of two parameters : the wall / field criterion @xmath16 and the minimum void - size threshold @xmath13 .",
    "the value of the wall / field criterion was calculated as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the mean distance to the third nearest neighbor halo and @xmath19 is its standard deviation . if is found that @xmath20 , and @xmath21mpc , at @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively . to determine the size threshold , we tested the statistical significance @xcite that is defined as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the numbers of the voids found in the real sample and in @xmath25 independent random samples , respectively .",
    "this test basically allows us to discriminate the true voids from the poisson gaps .",
    "[ fig : significance ] plots @xmath26 as a function of the size threshold , @xmath13 at @xmath5 and @xmath1 ( solid , dashed , dot - dashed and dashed line , respectively ) . noting that when @xmath27@xmath28mpc , @xmath26 reaches @xmath29 at all redshifts , we set the void size threshold at @xmath30@xmath28mpc .",
    "table [ tab : void ] lists the statistical properties of the voids at each redshift .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that these properties will depend on the void - finding algorithm .",
    "according to @xcite , the hv02 algorithm appears to identify as the void a much larger region ( and thus identify many more galaxies as void - galaxies ) than most of the other algorithms .",
    "thus , the mean effective comoving radius @xmath31 and the number of void galaxies @xmath32 listed in table [ tab : void ] are expected to be larger than for the cases of most of the other algorithms .",
    "it also indicates that the number of void filaments and their sizes would be larger when the hv02 algorithm is used .",

    "it is generally thought that the large scale structure of the universe provides a window on the initial condition of the early universe . in previous cosmological studies",
    ", it was the halo mass function that has been most highlighted as a statistical tool for probing cosmology with the large scale structure @xcite .",
    "the most advantageous aspect of the halo mass function is that it can be written in a simple universal form , independent of redshift @xcite .",
    "yet , the halo mass function has a generic weakness as a cosmological probe : its dependence on the cosmological parameters comes indirectly from the dependence of the halo mass on the rms fluctuation , @xmath34 , of the linear density field smoothed on a scale radius of @xmath35 .",
    "it is desirable to develop another statistical tool which can overcome the weakness of the halo mass function .",
    "recently , several authors have noted the possibility of probing cosmology with cosmic voids ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , no new statistical tool that can really compete with the halo mass function has been suggested so far .",
    "for instance , in our previous work @xcite , we have proposed that the cosmic voids provide another window on cosmology .",
    "given that the void ellipticities are induced by the primordial tidal effect which depends on the background cosmology , we have shown analytically that the void ellipticity distribution can be used to constrain the cosmological parameters .",
    "however , it has turned out that the void ellipticity distribution suffers from the same weakness that the halo mass function has .",
    "its dependence on cosmology is secondary , resulting from the dependence of the void scale on the linear rms density fluctuation , @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the void ellipticity distribution can not be written in a universal form unlike the halo mass function . therefore ,",
    "true as it is that the void ellipticity distribution provides another way to determine the cosmological parameters with the large scale structure , it is not competitively compared with the halo mass function .    in this work ,",
    "we have for the first time quantified the effect of the tidal field on cosmic voids by the sizes of the void filaments .",
    "it is shown that the size distribution of void filaments is almost independent of redshift , having a simple universal form .",
    "a crucial implication of our result is that the number density of long filaments in voids should depend very sensitively on the background cosmology since the sizes of the void filaments reflect the primordial tidal field .",
    "our result that the size distribution of void filaments is almost independent of redshift in spite of the well known fact that the sizes of voids grow very strongly with redshift can be understood as follows .",
    "it is true that the comoving sizes of voids keep growing as the voids expand faster than the rest of universe due to their extreme low density .",
    "however , the comoving sizes of void filaments should not necessarily keep growing with redshift .",
    "but for the effect of the tidal field , the spatial distribution of void halos would be isotropic due to the gravitational rarefaction effect caused by the fast expansion of voids .",
    "in other words , while the gravitational rarefaction effect tends to make the spatial distribution of void halos isotropic , the tidal effect on voids tends to increase the anisotropy in the distribution of void halos , resulting in growth of void filaments . therefore , as far as the tidal effect exists and counteracts the expansion effect , the sizes of void filaments will also grow as the sizes of their host voids grow with redshift .",
    "however , when the void size grows large enough to finally reach its threshold at which the expansion effect overcomes the tidal effect , the degree of anisotropy in the spatial distribution of void halos will diminish and accordingly the sizes of void filaments will stop growing .",
    "since this critical threshold of void size is determined by the single condition that the expansion effect overcomes the tidal effect , its value should be redshift - independent . at high - redshift when the sizes of voids were small , the strong dominant tidal effect increases the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of void halos , increasing the sizes of void filaments . at low - redshift",
    "when the sizes of voids are large , the strong expansion effect prevents the sizes of void filaments from keep growing .",
    "hence , the universal size distribution of void filaments reflects the fact that the sizes of void filaments are regulated by the counter - balance between the expansion effect and the tidal effect .    the fitting formula , eqs . ( [ eqn : fit1])-([eqn : fit2 ] ) ,",
    "indicate that the number density of void filaments , @xmath36 , behaves like a power - law with power index of @xmath11 in the short filament section while it decreases exponentially in the long filament section .",
    "a crucial implication of our result is that the exponential decrease of the abundance of long - size filaments in voids should be very sensitive to the key cosmological parameters .",
    "especially it is expected to depend sensitively on the amplitude of the linear power spectrum , @xmath37 . in our previous work",
    ", we have already shown that the void ellipticity caused by the tidal effect increases with the value of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we expect that the number density of long filaments in voids would increase as the value of @xmath37 increases .",
    "unlike the void ellipticity distribution whose dependence on @xmath37 is weak and indirect through its dependence on the rms density fluctuation , equation ( [ eqn : fit1 ] ) suggests that the size distribution of void filaments should depend strongly on the power spectrum amplitude .    to use the size distribution of void filaments as a cosmological probe",
    ", however , there should be some additional tasks to be done in the future .",
    "first , the mass - to - light bias and the redshift distortion effects have to be account for .",
    "what one can observe is not halos in real space but galaxies in redshift space .",
    "the size distribution of void filaments measured from the galaxy catalogs in redshift space could differ from the current result .",
    "thus , it will be very necessary to investigate how the bias and the redshift distortion effect change the size distribution of void filaments .",
    "it is expected that the sizes of void filaments may increase in redshift space since the redshift space distortion effect tend to increase the anisotropy in the spatial distribution of void galaxies . meanwhile",
    ", the matter - to - light bias might decrease the sizes of void filaments , compensating for the redshift distortion effect , since the massive halos are found to be distributed less anisotropically ( park & lee 2009 in preparation ) .",
    "henceforth , the overall size distribution of void galaxy filaments in redshift space might be similar to that in real space , due to the competition between the two effects ( in private communication with van de weygaert ) .",
    "second , a general analytic formula for the size distribution of void filaments in an arbitrary cosmology is desirable to derive from physical principles .",
    "if an analytic model is found , it would allow us to understand the true physical meaning of eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : fit1])-([eqn : fit2 ] ) .",
    "third , it should be worth examining whether the results depend on the choice of the filament - finding and the void - finding algorithms .",
    "as mentioned in  1 , it has been found that different void - finders provide different void properties and the hv02 algorithm that we used here has a tendency to find larger voids than most of the other void - finders @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our results are not general ones but valid only for the specific cosmology of the millennium run simulation .",
    "therefore , it is required to test the universality of the size distribution of void filaments with other void - finders and with other cosmologies as well .",
    "we plan to address these issues and report the results elsewhere in the near future .",
    "the authors would like to thank a referee for a constructive report .",
