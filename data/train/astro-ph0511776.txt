    "over the last twenty years the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm has become the standard model for structure formation in the universe .",
    "it assumes the cosmic mass budget to be dominated by cdm , whose gravitational effects build structure from an initially gaussian distribution of adiabatic fluctuations . important parameters specifying cdm models include the fraction of the critical density in matter , @xmath0 , and the fraction of the critical density in dark energy , @xmath7 ; these in part determine the expansion rate of the universe and the shape of the initial matter power spectrum .",
    "another important parameter is the amplitude of the power spectrum , conventionally quoted in terms of the rms linear mass fluctuation at @xmath5 in a sphere of radius 8 @xmath8mpc , @xmath1 ( @xmath9kms@xmath10mpc@xmath10 throughout ) .",
    "a series of exciting observations have been made in recent years which constrain these parameters , resulting in a concordance model @xcite  a spatially flat @xmath7cdm model with @xmath11 .",
    "these include measurements of the cluster mass function , the strong cluster correlation function , and the evolution of the cluster abundance with redshift @xcite ; the magnitude - redshift relation of type ia supernovae @xcite ; optical surveys of large scale structure @xcite ; anisotropies in the comic microwave background @xcite ; cosmic shear from weak lensing observations @xcite ; and lyman-@xmath12 forest absorption @xcite .",
    "a key concept in the build - up of structure in this model is the formation of dark matter halos quasi - equilibrium systems of dark matter , formed through non - linear gravitational collapse .",
    "galaxies and other luminous objects are assumed to form by cooling and condensation of baryons within these halos @xcite . thus understanding the evolution and development of dark matter halos is an important step toward understanding structure formation .",
    "the possibility of using internal cluster properties to place constraints on cosmological parameters has been explored in a variety of ways .",
    "for example @xcite suggested that the degree of substructure in clusters could constrain @xmath0 .",
    "different measures of substructure have been examined by @xcite and @xcite ; the power ratio method of the latter has been applied to chandra data by @xcite , showing that clusters had more substructure in the past , but without setting any cosmological constraints .    an interesting property",
    "to investigate is the ellipticity or axis ratio of clusters .",
    "observations suggest that cluster shapes , as traced by the distribution of galaxies @xcite , x - ray emission and/or sz decrement @xcite , and gravitational lensing @xcite , are usually not spherical .",
    "there is some indication that the mean ellipticity is evolving with redshift @xcite .",
    "dark matter and hydrodynamic simulations have also been utilized , resulting in cluster - sized halos which are triaxial @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the possibility of using cluster ellipticities as a cosmological probe , in particular of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the observed cluster samples are currently too small and too poorly characterized for strong constraints to be developed . however , with the ongoing optical , x - ray , weak lensing and sz surveys providing an ever - increasing sample of clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it will become possible to make more accurate statistical inferences concerning cluster ellipticities . in this paper",
    "we provide predictions of cluster ellipticities and their evolution for different cosmologies that could be directly compared with observations .",
    "we use numerical simulations of structure formation to generate clusters and determine their ellipticity evolution with redshift from @xmath5 to @xmath13 , systematically varying @xmath0 and @xmath1 in order to understand how these parameters affect cluster structure .",
    "the simulations , cluster selection , and derivation of cluster ellipticity are presented in  [ sec : ellip ] .",
    "the results of cluster ellipticities are shown in ",
    "[ sec : resellip ] , and we conclude in  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "a series of n - body lcdm cosmological simulations were run , with the only differences between runs being in the matter density and the power spectrum amplitude ; these were set to @xmath14 0.2 , 0.3 , and 0.5 , with @xmath15 0.7 , 0.9 , and 1.1 , for nine models in all .",
    "the linear cdm power spectrum was generated using the lingers.f code from the grafic2 package @xcite , with a hubble constant @xmath16 , baryon density @xmath17 , and spectral index @xmath18 .",
    "grafic2 was then used to generate the initial particle conditions , with the modification that the hanning filter was not used because it suppresses power on small scales @xcite .",
    "all of the runs contained @xmath19 particles in a periodic cube of size @xmath20mpc , making the particle mass @xmath21 .",
    "simulations were carried out using the tpm code @xcite with a @xmath22 mesh and a spline softening length of 20.35@xmath8kpc .",
    "the initial domain decomposition parameters in the tpm code were @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( tpm was modified slightly so that there was no lower limit to @xmath25 when it is reduced at later times , which improves the tracking of low mass halos ; for details on these parameters see @xcite ) .",
    "the particle positions were saved for every expansion factor interval 0.1 between @xmath26 and @xmath27 , i.e. from @xmath13 to the present .",
    "the fof ( friends - of - friends ) halo finder was run on each saved redshift , with a linking length @xmath28 times the mean interparticle separation @xcite .",
    "the resulting mass functions were in good agreement with the predictive formula of @xcite ( using @xmath28 ) for halos with 32 or more particles ( or mass above @xmath29 for @xmath30 ) .",
    "the center of mass of each fof halo thus identified was calculated , and all particles in a cube of size 4@xmath8mpc around this point were extracted .",
    "the most bound particle in this cube was identified , and all the particles within 1@xmath8mpc of this particle were selected to compute the ellipticity .",
    "all cluster ellipticities in this paper will refer to the ellipticity within a comoving radius of @xmath31mpc , as this radius should be easier to determine observationally .",
    "only halos with mass above @xmath32 ( 39 particles for @xmath30 ) within the 1@xmath8mpc radius were considered .",
    "varying @xmath33 from 0.14 to 0.2 had little effect on the final masses and ellipticities , because once a cluster center is chosen we use the mass within a specific radius of 1@xmath8mpc .",
    "the same set of random phases was used for all the runs ; we experimented with varying the seed used to generate these phases , and found this had no impact on the results .",
    "current observations indicate that the dark matter radial profile of clusters , obtained by gravitational lensing observations , follows the galaxy radial profile on the scale of 1@xmath8mpc @xcite .",
    "it is therefore expected that the observed distribution of galaxies will closely reflect the underlying mass distribution .",
    "the underlying mass distribution is also reflected in the observed distribution of the intracluster gas ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "further observations will shed additional light on this comparison .    to determine the ellipticity of a cluster",
    ", we find the best - fit ellipse using the matrix of second moments of particle positions about the center of mass : @xmath34 where the sum is over all the particles selected in the manner just described . given the normalized eigenvalues of @xmath35 , @xmath36",
    ", we use a common measure of ellipticity : @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the primary and secondary ellipsoid axes lengths respectively . since the 3-d ellipticity is not directly measured in observations , we also measure the projected 2-d cluster ellipticities on the x - y plane .",
    "the process of determining the projected cluster ellipticities is repeated as above and the 2-d ellipticity of each halo is : @xmath41 where @xmath42 .",
    "this 2-d ellipticity will be our definition of ellipticities in the paper , unless otherwise specified .",
    "after selecting the clusters as described above , we further separate the clusters into two groups : low mass clusters with masses @xmath43 in the range @xmath44 , and high mass clusters with @xmath45 ( @xmath43 denotes the mass within @xmath46mpc ) .",
    "this division was made because the mean cluster ellipticities have a small mass dependence .",
    "moreover , cluster surveys ( including act , apex , and spt ) which will produce larger cluster samples , will be best at detecting clusters with masses above @xmath47 @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "as it would be challenging to have accurate measures of mass for a large number of clusters , we have investigated the effect of a @xmath49 uncertainty in the mass determination in the threshold cut of @xmath47 @xmath48 ; this change affected the resulting mean ellipticities by less than 3% .",
    "in this section we investigate how cluster ellipticities depend upon the cosmological parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : e_z_hm ] presents the mean ellipticities as a function of redshift for high mass clusters ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the error bars show the variance of the mean : @xmath50 . the mean ellipticity increases with redshift for all models considered here .",
    "the dependence of cluster ellipticities on @xmath1 is significant : higher @xmath1 values ( i.e. clusters are forming earlier ) lead to lower ellipticities at @xmath5 .",
    "in contrast , the dependence on @xmath0 is relatively weak .",
    "an intriguing result is apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_s8_hm ] , which plots mean ellipticity at @xmath4 , @xmath3 , as a function of @xmath51 : there is an inverse linear relation between the two , nearly independent of @xmath0 ( except indirectly in that @xmath51 depends on @xmath0 ) .",
    "while the formation of clusters is a complex process , it appears that some average properties of clusters , such as ellipticities , can still be understood with a fairly simple picture : on average , the older the cluster , the more relaxed it is , and thus less elliptical .",
    "this is of course an over - simplified picture of the formation of clusters , but it does capture the general relation of fig .",
    "[ fig : e_s8_hm ] .    based on this figure",
    ", we fit the mean ellipticity @xmath3 of the high mass clusters ( @xmath52 ) to the following linear relationship : @xmath53 at @xmath5 this relation becomes @xmath6 .",
    "this relation of ellipticity as a function of redshift is shown by the lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : e_z_hm ] . while there are small variations from model to model ,",
    "the general trends are followed .",
    "the distribution of ellipticities can be fit reasonably well by a gaussian for all @xmath54 . for high mass clusters ,",
    "the standard deviation is nearly the same for all runs : a value of @xmath55 is within ten percent of the value measured at any redshift for all the models .",
    "thus , using the mean from eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hmfit ] , it is possible to characterize the complete distribution of ellipticities out to @xmath13 .",
    "also , as mentioned earlier , we have investigated including a @xmath49 uncertainty in the mass determination in the cut at @xmath47 @xmath48 ; this did not affect the resulting mean ellipticities at more than 3% .",
    "the results for cluster ellipticities of low mass clusters ( @xmath44 ) are presented in figures [ fig : e_z_lm ] and [ fig : e_s8_lm ] .",
    "these figures demonstrate that the low mass clusters show the same trend of increasing ellipticity with redshift , as well as increasing ellipticity with decreasing @xmath1 .",
    "however the dependence on @xmath0 is stronger than for the higher mass clusters .",
    "the fit corresponding to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hmfit ] for these clusters is : @xmath56 while the dependence on @xmath0 is more important for these smaller clusters , the dependence on @xmath51 is nearly the same for both samples : as with the higher mass clusters , for a given @xmath0 , the ellipticity decreases as @xmath51 increases .",
    "different definitions of the mass of the cluster and different methods of measuring the axis ratio will change the measured value of the mean ellipticity .",
    "it has generally been found in simulations that less massive objects are rounder ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this assumes that the ellipticity is measured using a fixed overdensity or fraction of the virial radius ; the outermost radius used thus becomes larger for more massive halos .",
    "here we instead employ a fixed annular radius of 1@xmath8mpc , which is more suitable for direct comparison with observations . this radius is less than the virial radius for the largest clusters , while extending beyond the virial radius for less massive systems .",
    "thus the low - mass sample , which includes more of the unrelaxed outlying regions of the clusters , actually has the same or a slightly higher mean ellipticity than the high - mass sample , where the relaxed cores dominate .",
    "interestingly , @xcite derived an analytic prediction that more massive halos are less elliptical , but concluded there were conceptual difficulties in comparing their work to simulations , concerning precisely this issue of how the axis ratios are to be determined .",
    "it is of course important when comparing observations to simulations that the same defintions and methods be followed in the comparison .",
    "we use large - scale cosmological simulations to determine the mean ellipticity of clusters of galaxies and its evolution with redshift to @xmath13 , in order to investigate the possible use of this quantity as a new tool in constraining cosmological parameters .",
    "nine lcdm cosmological models are studied , with @xmath0 ranging from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , and @xmath1 ranging from @xmath59 to @xmath60 .",
    "we provide predictions that can be directly compared with future observations of cluster ellipticities and can be used to place new independent constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "we find that the mean cluster ellipticity increases monotonically with redshift for all models .",
    "clusters were more elliptical at earlier times .",
    "the mean ellipticity of high mass clusters ( @xmath61 ) depends most strongly on @xmath1 : higher values of @xmath1 , i.e. , earlier cluster formation times , produce lower ellipticities than lower @xmath1 values .",
    "the dependence of ellipticity on @xmath0 is relatively weak .",
    "the high mass clusters exhibit an interestingly regular behavior for all the lcdm models : the mean ellipticity @xmath3 depends linearly on @xmath51 , the amplitude of fluctuations at the cluster redshift @xmath4 .",
    "the effect of @xmath0 is weak ( in the range @xmath2 ) for a given @xmath51 .",
    "the distribution of ellipticities for these clusters can be described by a gaussian , with a mean given by eqn .",
    "[ eqn : hmfit ] and a standard deviation of 0.09 .",
    "this simple description can be used for direct comparison with observations , as well as for constraining the cosmological parameters , especially @xmath62 .",
    "it can also be a useful input into the halo model @xcite of large - scale structure .",
    "the close connection between the mean ellipticity and @xmath51 , suggests that clusters form with similar high ellipticities at formation time and thereafter undergo relaxation , becoming more spherical with time e.g. , ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the amplitude @xmath51 reflects the cluster formation time : larger amplitudes correspond to earlier cluster formation , and hence to a lower relative ellipticity at a given redshift . in a low density universe ,",
    "furthermore , the merger rate is reduced at low redshift , allowing this relaxation to continue without much perturbation .",
    "both the formation time of clusters and the merger rate are linked with the amplitude of the spectrum of mass fluctuations and hence with the ellipticity . however , the exact time of cluster formation can not be easily defined @xcite , since a more accurate theoretical understanding of structure formation is necessary to explain the link .",
    "numerous large cluster surveys are currently underway or in planning stages , aimed at producing increasingly more accurate and complete samples of clusters .",
    "such surveys will enable the determination of cluster ellipticities for large and complete cluster samples using the galaxy distribution ( optical ) , the hot gas distribution ( x - ray and sz ) , and the dark matter distribution ( lensing ) in the clusters .",
    "these surveys include , among others , the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , the red sequence cluster survey @xcite , x - ray and sz cluster surveys @xcite , act @xcite , gravitational lensing surveys @xcite , and lsst .",
    "each method has different selection functions and selection biases , as is well known .",
    "the ability to measure and compare cluster ellipticities using several independent methods will enable not only an improved understanding of the internal structure and physical processes in clusters , but will also enable the use of cluster ellipticities in cosmology .",
    "the computations were run at princeton on facilities supported by nsf grant ast-0216105 , and at the national center for supercomputing applications with support of a grant of supercomputing time ( number mca04n002p ) .",
