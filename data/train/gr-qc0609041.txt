    "the problem of the effect of gravity on the electromagnetic field of a charged particle leading to the consideration of the einstein - maxwell equations has been one of the most extensively treated in the literature , resulting in exact solutions ( see @xcite and references therein ) as well as in a variety of approximation methods @xcite .",
    "we address in this article the problem of a massive charged particle of mass @xmath0 and charge @xmath1 in the field of a reissner - nordstrm geometry describing a static charged black hole , with mass @xmath2 and charge @xmath3 .",
    "we solve this problem by the first order perturbation approach formulated by zerilli @xcite using the tensor harmonic expansion of the einstein - maxwell system of equations .",
    "note that a similar approach was used by sibgatullin and alekseev @xcite to study electrovacuum perturbations of a reissner - nordstrm black hole . a manifestly gauge invariant ( hamiltonian )",
    "formalism was developed by moncrief @xcite .",
    "the relations between these two different treatments of perturbations have been extensively investigated by bik @xcite .",
    "both the mass and charge of the particle are described by delta functions .",
    "the source terms of the einstein equations contain the energy - momentum tensor associated with the particle s mass , the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor associated with the background field as well as additional interaction terms , to first order in @xmath0 and @xmath1 , proportional to the product of the square of the charge of the background geometry and the particle s mass ( @xmath4 ) and to the product of the charges of both the particle and the black hole ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "these terms give origin to the so called electromagnetically induced gravitational perturbation ",
    "on the other hand , the source terms of the maxwell equations contain the electromagnetic current associated with the particle s charge as well as interaction terms proportional to the product of the black hole s charge and the particle s mass ( @xmath6 ) , giving origin to the gravitationally induced electromagnetic perturbation  @xcite .",
    "we give in section ii the basic equations to be integrated in order to solve this problem .    before proceeding to the solution of the most general problem , we recall a variety of particular approaches followed in the current literature within the simplified framework of test field approximations @xcite . in section iii , the test field solutions for a charged particle at rest in the field of a schwarzschild as well as a reissner - nordstrm black hole are summarized , under the conditions @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the case of a test charge in the schwarzschild black hole is reviewed first in section iii a ; the corresponding solution is obtained by using the vector harmonic expansion of the electromagnetic field in curved space @xcite .",
    "the conditions above imply the solution of the maxwell equations only in a fixed schwarzschild metric , since the perturbation to the background geometry given by the electromagnetic stress - energy tensor is second order in the particle s charge . as a result ,",
    "no constraint on the position of the test particle follows from the einstein equations and the bianchi identities : any position of the particle is allowed , and the solution for the corresponding electromagnetic field has been widely analyzed @xcite .",
    "in section iii b we recall this same test field approximation applied to the case of a reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "this treatment is due to leaute and linet @xcite ; in analogy with the schwarzschild case , they used the vector harmonic expansion of the electromagnetic field holding the background geometry fixed .",
    "however , this test field approximation  is not valid in the present context .",
    "in fact , in addition to neglecting the effect of the particle mass on the background geometry , this treatment also neglects the electromagnetic induced gravitational perturbation terms linear in the charge of the particle which would contribute to modifying the metric as well . in section iii",
    "c we recall how , within this same approximation still neglecting these same feedback terms , bonnor @xcite studied the condition for the equilibrium involving the black hole and particle parameters @xmath11 as well as their separation distance @xmath12 .",
    "he finds the constraint @xmath13 if the black hole is extreme  or critically charged ",
    "satisfying @xmath14 , then the particle must also have the same ratio @xmath15 , and equilibrium exists independent of the separation . in the general non - extreme case @xmath16",
    "there is instead only one position of the particle which corresponds to equilibrium , for given values of the charge - to - mass ratios of the bodies . in this case",
    "the particle charge - to - mass ratio satisfies @xmath17 .",
    "this condition corresponds to the overcritically charged case for a reissner - nordstrm solution with the same parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 corresponding to a naked singularity .",
    "already the leaute and linet generalization modifies in a significant way the results obtained in the case of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "indeed a new phenomenon occurs in this case : as the hole becomes extreme an effect analogous to the meissner effect for the electric field arises , with the electric field lines of the test charge being forced outside the outer horizon @xcite .",
    "this result by itself justifies the need of addressing this problem in the more general zerilli approach duly taking into account all the first order perturbations .",
    "the correct way to attack the problem is , thus , to solve the linearized einstein - maxwell equations following zerilli s first order tensor harmonic analysis @xcite . in section [ schwpert ]",
    "we first consider the simplest special case of a massive neutral particle at rest near a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we first show explicitly that a perturbative solution for this problem free of singularities can not exist .",
    "we then give the explicit form of the perturbation corresponding to a stable configuration when there is the presence of a strut  between the particle and the black hole , corresponding to a conical singularity .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the classical work by einstein and rosen @xcite , who considered the weyl class double chazy - curzon solution @xcite for two point masses placed on the symmetry axis at a fixed distance .",
    "we find it very helpful to use a new gauge condition particularly adapted to this problem which differs from the corresponding regge - wheeler gauge in the schwarzschild case , by adding additional terms to the third regge - wheeler gauge condition to take into account the additional terms in the field equations .",
    "the resulting perturbed metric we obtain is the linearized form of the exact solution representing two collinear uncharged black holes in a static configuration belonging to the weyl class @xcite .",
    "we review some of their properties and peculiar features of these solutions in the appendix .",
    "we then turn to the general case of a charged massive particle at rest in a reissner - nordstrm background .",
    "this problem needs the simultaneous analysis of both the vectorial perturbation to describe the electromagnetic perturbation and the tensorial perturbation necessary to analyze the perturbation by the particle mass as well as the electromagnetically induced gravitational perturbation and the gravitationally induced electromagnetic perturbation .",
    "the einstein - maxwell equations reduce to a system of @xmath18 coupled ordinary differential equations for @xmath19 unknown functions determining both the gravitational and electromagnetic perturbed fields .",
    "then , by imposing the compatibility of the system ( or equivalently , requiring that the bianchi identities be fulfilled ) , we obtain an equilibrium condition for the system which coincides with the condition ( [ bonnoreqcond0 ] ) obtained by bonnor in his simplified approach .",
    "this is surprising , since our result has been obtained within a more general framework , and both the gravitational and electromagnetic fields are different from those used by bonnor .",
    "we then succeed in the exact reconstruction of both the perturbed gravitational and electromagnetic fields by summing all multipoles .",
    "the perturbed metric we derive is spatially conformally flat , free of singularities and thus can not belong to the weyl class two - body solutions , which are characterized by the occurrence of a conical singularity on the axis between the bodies .",
    "the asymptotic mass measured at large distances by the schwarzschild - like behaviour of the metric of the whole system consisting of black hole and particle is given by @xmath20 where the interaction energy turns out to be @xmath21\\ .\\ ] ]    recently perry and cooperstock @xcite and bretn , manko and snchez @xcite have used multi - soliton techniques to study exact electrostatic solutions of the einstein - maxwell equations representing the exterior field of two arbitrary charged reissner - nordstrm bodies in equilibrium .",
    "they have shown by numerical methods that gravitational - electrostatic balance without intervening tension or strut can occur for non - critically charged spherically symmetric bodies in the case of one black hole with @xmath16 and one naked singularity . however , they have not obtained an explicit dependence ( in algebraic form ) of the balance condition on the separation of the bodies , so we can not compare our analytical formula with their numerical results .",
    "attention is devoted also to the limiting case in which @xmath22 . in this case",
    "our solution coincides with the linearized form of the exact solution of majumdar and papapetrou @xcite , where equilibrium exists independent of the separation between the bodies .    within our approximation for @xmath16",
    ", we find that a horizon seems to form around the particle very close to it where the gravitational perturbation is not small compared to the background metric and hence the approximation is no longer valid .",
    "the study of the full nonlinear problem , namely the corresponding exact two - body solution of the einstein - maxwell equations is therefore required .",
    "attempts in this direction are being pursued by belinski and alekseev @xcite by using soliton techniques .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm solution is an electrovacuum solution of the einstein - maxwell field equations @xmath23 where @xmath24\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor . in standard schwarzschild - like coordinates , the corresponding metric",
    "is given by @xmath25 and the electromagnetic field by @xmath26 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the mass and charge of the black hole , in terms of which the horizon radii are @xmath27 .",
    "we consider the case @xmath28 and the region @xmath29 outside the outer horizon , with an extremely charged hole corresponding to @xmath30 ( which implies @xmath31 ) where the two horizons coalesce into one .",
    "let us consider a perturbation of the reissner - nordstrm solution due to some external source described by a matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath32 as well as an electromagnetic current @xmath33 .",
    "the combined einstein - maxwell equations are @xmath34 where the quantities denoted by the tilde refer to the total electromagnetic and gravitational fields , to first order of the perturbation : @xmath35\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde g_{\\mu \\nu } & = & \\tilde r_{\\mu \\nu } -\\frac12\\tilde g_{\\mu \\nu } \\tilde r\\ ; \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the covariant derivative operation makes use of the perturbed metric @xmath36 as well .",
    "the corresponding quantities without the tilde refer to the background reissner - nordstrm geometry ( [ rnmetric ] ) , and electromagnetic field ( [ rnemfield ] ) .    following zerilli @xcite",
    ", we then consider first - order perturbations ; the einstein tensor and the electromagnetic energy - momentum tensor ( [ pertrelations ] ) up to the linear order can be expanded as follows : @xmath37 where @xmath38-\\frac12 h_{\\mu\\nu}r\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\delta t_{\\mu \\nu } ^{(h)}&=&-\\frac1{4\\pi}\\left[\\left(f^{\\alpha}{}_{\\mu}f^{\\beta}{}_{\\nu}-\\frac12 g_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\alpha\\lambda}f^{\\beta}{}_{\\lambda}\\right)h_{\\alpha\\beta}+\\frac14 f^{\\rho\\sigma}f_{\\rho\\sigma}h_{\\mu\\nu}\\right]\\ , \\nonumber\\\\ \\delta t_{\\mu \\nu } ^{(f)}&=&-\\frac1{4\\pi}\\left[2f^{\\rho}{}_{(\\mu}f_{\\nu)\\rho}+\\frac12 g_{\\mu\\nu}f^{\\rho\\sigma}f_{\\rho\\sigma}\\right]\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the expansion of the quantity @xmath41 appearing in the maxwell equations turn out to be explicitly @xmath42 where the last term can be interpreted as an effective gravitational current and is given by @xmath43 as a result , the terms @xmath44 and @xmath45 symbolically represent the electromagnetically induced gravitational perturbation , while the term @xmath46 represents the gravitationally induced electromagnetic perturbation @xcite .",
    "we now specialize this general framework to the case of a perturbing source being represented by a massive charged particle at rest .",
    "a point charge of mass @xmath0 and charge @xmath1 moving along a worldline @xmath47 with 4-velocity @xmath48 is described by the matter energy - momentum tensor @xmath49 and electromagnetic current @xmath50 where the normalization of the delta functions is defined by @xmath51 the perturbation equations are obtained from the einstein - maxwell equations ( [ em ] ) , keeping terms to first order .",
    "there are two parameters of smallness of the perturbation : the mass @xmath0 of the particle and its charge @xmath1 , which can be expressed as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the charge to mass ratio of the particle .",
    "therefore , the perturbation will be small if @xmath0 and so @xmath1 are sufficiently small with respect to the black hole mass and charge , the charge to mass ratio which , instead , need not to be small .",
    "let us consider the special case of the charged particle at rest at the point @xmath54 on the polar axis @xmath55 .",
    "the only nonvanishing components of the stress - energy tensor ( [ tmunupartgen ] ) and of the current density ( [ jmupartgen ] ) associated with the charged particle are given by @xmath56 since @xmath57 is the corresponding 4-velocity .",
    "following zerilli s @xcite procedure , we must now expand the fields @xmath58 and @xmath59 as well as the source terms ( [ sorgenti ] ) in tensor and scalar harmonics respectively , obtaining a set of first order perturbation equations by linearizing the einstein - maxwell system ( [ einmaxeqs ] ) .",
    "zerilli showed that in the einstein - maxwell system of equations electric gravitational multipoles couple only to electric electromagnetic multipoles , and similarly for magnetic multipoles .",
    "the axial symmetry of the problem about the @xmath60 axis ( @xmath55 ) allows us to put the azimuthal parameter equal to zero in the expansion , leading to a great simplification in the solving procedure .",
    "furthermore , it is sufficient to consider only electric - parity perturbations , since there are no magnetic sources @xcite .",
    "before looking for a solution of the above general problem within the framework of first order perturbation theory it is interesting to recall the results in the simplest case of test field approximation , i.e. by neglecting the particle backreaction , namely the changes in the background metric due to the mass and charge of the particle .",
    "this test field approximation requires only the vector harmonic description of the electric field of the test particle alone .      for any elementary particle",

    "that leads to enormous simplification in the treatment of the perturbations of extreme black holes , and it is a powerful tool for the analysis of higher order perturbations , since one can stop in the perturbation theory at any order one desires .      although the spacetime of a black hole and a charged particle is not an electro - vacuum one , we start from an exact solution of the einstein - maxwell field equations without sources , and by linearizing it , we will obtain an exact solution of the coupled perturbation equations .",

    "the idea is to use an analogy such that the particle and a very small extreme black hole can be thought as the same kind of object and have the same fields at far distances from themselves . the majumdar - papapetrou solution is included in the class of electro - vacuum and conformally static solutions of the einstein - maxwell system .",
