    "decay daughters of resonances which decay inside the medium may also scatter with other particles from the medium , mostly pions for sps and rhic energies .",
    "this results in a non - reconstructable resonance from the decay daughters measured in the detector , because the invariant mass of the decay daughters no longer matches that of the parent .",
    "the reconstructed resonance signal from the scattered decay daughters is a few hundred mev broad in the urqmd model @xcite and is therefor not distinguishable from the background distribution .",
    "the rescattering and regeneration ( pseudo - elastic ) process for resonances and their decay particles depend on the individual cross sections and are dominant after chemical but before the kinetic freeze - out .",
    "these interactions can result in changes of the reconstructed resonance yields , momentum spectra and widths .",
    "rescattering will decrease the measured resonance yields while the mechanism of regeneration will increase the them .",
    "microscopic model calculations include every step in a heavy ion interaction in terms of elastic and inelastic interactions of hadrons and strings @xcite .",
    "they are therefore able to describe the rescattering and regeneration contribution on the resonances in a fireball .",
    "the prediction of this model ( urqmd ) is a signal loss for some of the resonances due to more rescattering than regeneration in the low momentum region p@xmath0  gev for the hadronic decays .",

    "a resonance is a particle with a higher mass than the corresponding ground state particle with the same quark content .",
    "it decays strongly and therefore the lifetime , @xmath1 , of the resonance is short ( within a few fm / c ) .",
    "this causes a wide spread in energy and a natural width , given by @xmath2 = @xmath3/@xmath1 .",
    "these broad states with finite @xmath2 and lifetime @xmath1 can be formed by collisions between the same particles into which they decay .",
    "the resonances can have hadronic and leptonic decay channels .",
    "since they have a short lifetime they can only be measured by reconstruction using the decay particles measured in the detector . at the beginning of the 1960 s",

    "the probability of rescattering is described by the ( energy averaged ) interaction cross section of the decay particles of the resonances within the medium , and depends on the radius , density and velocity of the fireball . a slower expansion of the fireball would lead to a higher suppression of the resonance signal due to the larger rate of rescattering .",
