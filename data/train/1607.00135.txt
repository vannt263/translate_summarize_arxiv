    "research into entanglement of quantum states has long history from the very beginning of quantum mechanics@xcite . at that time",
    "the main motivation for the study of entanglement was pure theoretical .",
    "it was to explore the non - local properties of quantum mechanics .",
    "recent considerable attention to the quantum entanglement@xcite has both theoretical and practical aspects .",
    "while the former is for understanding of quantum information theories more deeply , the latter is for developing the quantum technology .",
    "as shown for last two decades quantum entanglement plays a central role in quantum teleportation@xcite , superdense coding@xcite , quantum cloning@xcite , and quantum cryptography@xcite .",
    "it is also quantum entanglement , which makes the quantum computer outperform the classical one@xcite .",
    "thus , it is very important to understand how to quantify and how to characterize the entanglement .",
    "still , however , this issue is not completely understood .    for bipartite quantum system",
    "many entanglement measures were constructed before such as distillable entanglement@xcite , entanglement of formation ( eof)@xcite , and relative entropy of entanglement ( ree)@xcite . among them the closed formula for the analytic computation of eof were found in ref .",
    "@xcite via the concurrence @xmath10 as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a binary entropy function @xmath13 . for two - qubit pure state @xmath14 with @xmath15 , the concurrence @xmath16 between party @xmath17 and party @xmath18",
    "is given by @xmath19 where the einstein convention is understood and @xmath20 is an antisymmetric tensor . for two - qubit mixed state @xmath21 the concurrence @xmath22 can be computed by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 are eigenvalues of positive operator @xmath25 with decreasing order .",
    "thus , one can compute the eof for all two - qubit states in principle .",
    "generalization to the multipartite entanglement is highly important and challenging issue in the context of quantum information theories .",
    "a seminal step toward this goal was initiated in ref .",
    "@xcite by examining the three - qubit pure states .",
    "authors in ref . @xcite have shown analytically the monogamy relation @xmath26 this relation implies that the entanglement ( measured by the squared concurrence ) between @xmath27 and the remaining parties always exceeds entanglement between @xmath27 and @xmath28 plus entanglement between @xmath27 and @xmath29 .",
    "this means that if @xmath27 and @xmath28 is maximally entangled , the whole system can not have the tripartite entanglement .",
    "the inequality ( [ ckw ] ) is strong in a sense that the three - qubit w - state@xcite @xmath30 saturates the inequality .",
    "moreover , for three - qubit pure state @xmath31 the leftover in the inequality @xmath32 which we will call the residual entanglement is called the three - tangle",
    ". ] , has following two expressions : @xmath33 where @xmath34 from first expression one can show that @xmath35 is invariant under a stochastic local operation and classical communication ( slocc)@xcite . from second expression",
    "one can show that @xmath35 is invariant under the qubit permutation .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath35 is an entanglement monotone .",
    "thus , the residual entanglement ( or three - tangle ) can play a role as an important measure for the genuine three - way entanglement .    by making use of eq .",
    "( [ tangle3 ] ) one can compute the residual entanglement of all three - qubit pure states . for mixed state the residual entanglement",
    "is usually defined as a convex roof method@xcite @xmath36 where the minimum is taken over all possible ensembles of pure states .",
    "the ensemble corresponding to the minimum of @xmath35 is called optimal decomposition . for given three - qubit mixed state",
    "it is highly difficult , in general , to find its optimal decomposition except very rare cases@xcite .    in order to find the entanglement measures in the multipartite system",
    ", there are two different approaches .",
    "first approach is to find the invariant monotones under the slocc transformation . as ref.@xcite has shown , any linearly homogeneous positive function of a pure state that is invariant under determinant @xmath37 slocc operations is an entanglement monotone .",
    "thus , the concurrence @xmath16 and the three - tangle @xmath38 are monotones .",
    "it is also possible to construct the slocc - invariant monotones in the higher - qubit systems . in the higher - qubit systems , however , there are many independent monotones , because the number of independent slocc - invariant monotones is equal to the degrees of freedom of pure quantum state minus the degrees of freedom induced by the determinant @xmath37 slocc operations . for example , there are @xmath39 independent monotones in @xmath40-qubit system .",
    "thus , in four - qubit system there are six invariant monotones . among them , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite by making use of the antilinearity@xcite that there are following three independent monotones which measure the true four - way entanglement : @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and the einstein convention is introduced with a metric @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that there are following three maximally entangled states in four - qubit system : @xmath47 the measures @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 are summarized in table i. recently , @xmath55 and the corresponding linear monotones @xmath56 for the rank-@xmath4 mixtures consist of one of the maximally entangled state and @xmath57 are explicitly computed@xcite .        from eq .",
