    "high - contrast imaging of nearby stars is a powerful tool to acquire novel insights regarding the architecture and formation history of planetary systems .",
    "such observations are indeed sensitive to sub - stellar companions and faint planets in a separation regime ( @xmath1au ) difficult to reach using indirect methods @xcite .",
    "they also enable to survey the vicinity of young and adolescent stars @xcite and thus provide direct constraints on the early stages of planetary formation and evolution @xcite . over the past few years a handful of such objects",
    "have been directly imaged @xcite . because their near - infrared radiation is readily available for characterization , their discovery has spurred numerous follow - up photometric and spectroscopic observations @xcite .",
    "this wealth of information , only available in favorable configurations in the case of exo - planets detected with indirect methods , has in turn inspired discussions regarding their underlying bulk physical properties and atmospheric chemistry @xcite .",
    "their unique loci in the separation vs. age plane combined with their rich observable astrophysical content makes directly imaged exo - planets very compelling comparative exo - planetology objects .",
    "large observational programs , relying on new generation instruments , aimed at identifying more of such faint companions are currently underway or about to be started @xcite.the observation underlying this paper were obtained using one of such instruments : the project 1640 integral field spectrograph @xcite installed at the palomar hale telescope behind the palm 3000 adaptive optics system @xcite .    using an ifs one can reveal near - infrared spectroscopic features of sub - stellar companions to nearby stars , study their atmosphere and infer their bulk physical properties @xcite .",
    "however spectroscopic observations can not fully address uncertainties in the mass - luminosity relationship of sub - stellar objects at young ages ( @xmath2 myrs ) , since imaging does directly yield observables commensurate with dynamical masses .",
    "they are inferred by folding together estimated age ( based on stellar indicators ) and mass - luminosity relationships ( based on evolutionary models ) , onto their observed photometric points .",
    "calibrating this relationship at young ages is thus of the utmost importance .",
    "a key component of the upcoming large surveys will be to obtain , at least for a subset of the discovered objects , model independent dynamical mass estimates .",
    "for later type host stars this can be accomplished by obtaining three dimensional orbits that combine direct imaging and radial velocity observations @xcite . for low mass ratio binaries with physical small separations",
    "this is achieved via direct astrometric monitoring over a full orbital period of the binary pair @xcite .",
    "however for young sources with orbital periods",
    "@xmath3 yrs and high mass ratio , it is very difficult to observe the gravitational influence of the companion on its host star .",
    "one of the most promising avenue to obtain dynamical masses for such young benchmark objects is to use the companion orbital motion to constrain the second order dynamical interaction between the various components in a multiple system @xcite , or a single planet and a circumstellar disk . in all cases ,",
    "precise orbital characterization , and thus precise astrometry , is at the crux of this mass determination . because all future direct imaging campaigns will rely on",
    "an integral field spectrograph as the main survey camera , robust astrometric estimators with such instruments is of critical interest .",
    "the first goal of this paper is to introduce such a tool to the high - contrast imaging community . in section [ sec : data ]",
    "we discuss how to retrieve not only the spectra but also the relative position of faint planets with respect to their host star , in the regime where they are buried under quasi - static speckles .",
    "+      hr8799 is a nearby ( @xmath4 pc ) young star ( @xmath5 myrs ) , which harbors a multiple planetary system , with four planets orbiting at separations ranging from @xmath6 to @xmath7 au @xcite . in a parent paper by @xcite , we reported near - infrared ( @xmath8 ) spectroscopic observations ( @xmath9 ) of the four planets in this system .",
    "our results highlighted how the spectral energy distributions of these objects are different from known brown dwarfs , and established their spectral diversity , in spite of having formed in the same circumstellar environment .",
    "these spectra are also sensitive to a variety of molecular opacities in the atmosphere of each planet , and will thus be the observational foundation of future theoretical work aimed at understanding their complex atmospheric chemistry .",
    "the hr8799 system is extremely interesting from a dynamical mass determination standpoint because of its high multiplicity . since its discovery numerous epochs of this system",
    "have been reported .",
    "this provides a finely sampled orbital coverage starting in 2008 .",
    "moreover @xcite recently unravelled the three outermost planets in 1998 hst - nicmos archival data , yielding a sufficiently large temporal baseline to constrain the eccentricity of the second innermost planet .",
    "before the detection of hr8799e various authors considered the dynamical architecture of this system and suggested that the masses of hr8799bcd might be lower than estimated in the discovery paper @xcite in order for the system to have remained stable over its lifetime @xcite . recently combined the 1998 hst - nicmos points with an early estimate for the orbit of hr8799e ( @xmath10 yrs of temporal baseline ) and suggested that indeed the dynamical masses of these planets lie around @xmath11 .",
    "this paper reports the orbital position of hr8799bcde at our p1640 epoch , and then establishes the subspace of orbits allowable given the collection of epoch obtained over the past few years .",
    "we do so by resorting to a bayesian analysis using markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) .",
    "we carry out this work in a effort to complement recent orbit fitting efforts and dynamical investigations which assumed combinations of coplanarity , mean - motion resonances and/or circular orbits .",
    "these assumptions were necessary to constrain this degenerate problem to a sufficiently small orbital subspace .",
    "the priors in our analysis solely reside in the uncorrelated prior random distribution of each orbital keplerian elements of each planet .",
    "we present our results in section [ sec : astro ] and discuss them in the context of already published work in section [ sec : discuss ] . in a subsequent paper we will fold these constraints on the orbits of each planet into an comprehensive dynamical analysis of this system @xcite . +",
    "hr8799 was observed with p1640 on june 14th and june 15th 2012 under excellent conditions and on october 5th 2012 under median conditions .",
    "june 14 and 15 observations comprised a total of 46 and 31 minutes of exposure time , while 165 minutes of integration time were obtained on 5 october 2012 .",
    "details of the observations and conditions and instrumental setup are thoroughly described in @xcite and we refer to that paper for further details .",
    "these data took advantage of the interferometric calibration system @xcite . because of their high quality , and in particular their sensitivity to the two innermost planets we only consider the june 14 - 15th data in the present paper .",
    "when seeking to measure the position of faint companions with respect to their host star three main sources of uncertainties arise : uncertainties associated with intrinsic instrumental calibrations ( distortion , plate scale , and absolute north orientation ) , uncertainties associated with the actual location of the star in the focal plane , and biases induced by the speckle suppression algorithm that is required to disentangle the exo - planetary photons from light scattered by wavefront errors .",
    "we calibrated plate scale and absolute north using by observing the visual binary hd120476 , with a grade 2 orbit , , from the sixth catalog of orbits of visual binary stars @xcite on the night of june 14th .",
    "intrinsic distortions induced by both the palm 3000 adaptive optics system and p1640 are by design smaller than @xmath12  @xciteover the small p1640 field of view .",
    "their night to night variations have been measured to be of the same order @xcite .",
    "we could unfortunately not obtain images of the a globular cluster in order to empirically derive a geometric distortion map that is contemporaneous with our hr8799 observations @xcite .",
    "we mitigate this lack of an empirical distortion reference by nodding the position of our images of hd120476 over the p1640 detector and deriving a plate scale and pa offset at each location . when folding together these measurements we derived a plate - scale of @xmath13  , and a rotation of the focal plane array with respect to absolute north of @xmath14 .",
    "because the host star is hidden by the apodized pupil lyot coronagraph @xcite and the four planets have relative brightness respectively of 3.2% , 3.3% , 2.9% and 3.7% of the mean speckle brightness in their vicinity , the other two uncertainties require particular scrutiny .",
    "below we detail the methods our team developed to address potential systematic and quantify robust confidence intervals for these two sources of uncertainties .",
    "our dataset data is composed images in which the stellar position varies as a result of atmospheric differential refraction within a multi - wavelength cube and instrument tip tilt jitter between exposures .",
    "our first step is thus to make sure that this ensemble of point spread function ( psfs ) is co - aligned :    * due to the presence of quasi - static speckles , post - processing is needed to discriminate planets from speckles in these coronagraphic images .",
    "precise sub - pixel image registration is a necessary condition for the algorithms discussed in section 2.3 to yield optimal performances . *",
    "measuring orbital motion is the primary goal of the present paper .",
    "stellar location in the field of view thus ought to be estimated precisely either in each single slice of each cube or in co - added broadband images , composed of slices that have been first been aligned in the relative sense .    in this paper",
    "we follow the latter approach : we first compensate adr and tip - tilt jitter by registering all realizations of the psf in the observing sequence one to another .",
    "once relative alignment is achieved we combined all slices in all cubes in order to estimate stellar position ( see section 2.2.2 ) . + we achieve relative registration using cross - correlations between images @xcite .",
    "we found that this methods , solely based on the data at hand , did yield better registration on p1640 data when compared to methods based on psf models .",
    "we first start by retrieving the scaling relationship between slices in a cube .",
    "indeed , in an ifs data - cube the psf of the quasi - static speckle field stretches as the wavelength increases , and this feature can be used to reveal the presence of planets below the noise floor set by wavefront errors @xcite .",
    "however this scaling relationship prevents us from directly applying cross - correlation based image registration algorithms between cubes at different wavelengths .",
    "our first step towards adr correction thus consists of stretching / squashing all slices to the same scale , usually corresponding to the reference wavelength at the spectral channel of highest throughput in p1640 .",
    "while this scaling relationship is linear in theory , its behavior as a function of spectral channel can be altered by the earth s atmosphere or the instrument s dispersion .",
    "it is also preferable to retrieve it empirically based on the data at hand , using a method that is not sensitive to stellar position .",
    "this is achieved by correlating the absolute value of the fourier transform of two psfs obtained at separate wavelengths .",
    "indeed , the absolute value of the transformed psf in the u - v plane captures the information relative to the spatial scale of each image , and does not depend on the relative centering of the images or stellar location ( which is captured by the phase in the u - v plane ) .",
    "our procedure then goes as follows .",
    "the template psf is transformed using a matrix fourier transform of scaling unity ( equivalent to a fast fourier transform ) while the psf for which the relative scaling is sought is transformed using a matrix fourier transform of scaling @xmath15 ( see details in @xcite ) .",
    "we then proceed to find the value of @xmath15 which minimizes the cross - correlation of the modulus of the two transformed images .",
    "we find that , while the spatial scaling law deviates from the theoretical linear behavior over the full p1640 wavelength range ( @xmath16 m ) , it does not vary significantly from exposure to exposure and only needs to be updated on a night - to - night basis , or run to run , depending on observing conditions .",
    "once this scaling law is known , we proceed to either compress or stretch all the slices in an observing sequence to our chosen reference wavelength .",
    "+ in a second step , now that all slices are at the same scale , we carry out relative alignment by cross - correlating each slice to a reference images , chosen as the slice at our reference wavelength in the first cube of the observing sequence .",
    "we calculate the relative image alignment offsets of each channel using the sub - pixel alignment algorithm described in @xcite .",
    "finally we stretch / squash all cubes to their natural scale in order to obtain a new series of cubes that have been adr and tip - tilt corrected . in this set of aligned cubes ( in the relative sense ) all slices in all cubes of the observing sequence are registered so that their stellar location coincides as well as possible with the stellar location in the reference slices .",
    "this corresponds to an empirical correction of both the atmospheric dispersion across each given cube , and of the tip - tilt jitter between cubes .",
    "note that we compared the result of this relative alignment process with adr models and found good agreement within @xmath17 1/10 th of a pixel for this particular dataset and a variety of other p1640 observations ( nilson et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "however at this stage the * absolute stellar location in the focal plane is unknown*. this quantity is critical to constrain the orbital motion of planets around their parent star and we next show how to estimate it using this set of empirically registered slices .",
    "+      current direct imaging observations rely on deep images with the host star being saturated to identify the planets . the location of the star is estimated using short exposures , combined with the introduction of a neutral density filter , or using the location of the secondary support structures @xcite . in the presence of a coronagraph , and of a differential tip - tilt closed loop operating to ensure alignment of the star with focal plane occulting spot @xcite , there is no direct image of the star in the focal plane .",
    "this largely complicates the estimation of stellar position .",
    "to address this problem , a set of four fiducial stellar psfs can be introduced in outer radii of coronagraphic images @xcite , either using a pupil plane grid associated with the apodizer or by modulating the surface of the deformable mirror .",
    "these fiducial `` satellite spots '' then create an astrometric reference frame can be used to infer the location of the host star in occulted images . when using an astrometric grid or dm modulation we can take advantage of the broadband radial elongation of `` artificial speckles '' to infer the location of the star .",
    "the p1640 june observations of hr8799 were conducted without the pupil plane grid and without dm modulation .",
    "here we demonstrate how the stellar location can still be derived in such images based solely on the radial elongation of `` natural speckles '' in ifs data .",
    "our method can be applied to configurations for which fiducial astrometric spots are present , and we discuss both cases for the sake of generality .",
    "however it is important to notice that our method relies on the hypothesis that broadband speckles do point towards the stellar location . in general",
    "this is not true since adr , or adc residuals , does modify the stellar location across the bandpass and this hypothesis is not rigorously true .",
    "however because in the case of ifs data we reconstruct the broadband image based on narrow band slices that have already been registered one to another this effect is largely mitigated , whether or not the adr is corrected in the instrument , and the only residual source of uncertainty corresponds to the stellar motion due the earth atmosphere within the narrow bandpass of a p1640 slice .",
    "this uncertainty is much smaller than the one arising from the method herein .",
    "thus for the remainder of the paper we operate under the hypothesis that broadband speckles do point towards the stellar location . for non dispersed data , the chromatic stellar motion ought first to be estimated using adr , or adc residuals , models before the method described below can be carried out .",
    "we write a co - added broadband image as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denote focal plane coordinates .",
    "note that the relative alignment , between spectral channels , is necessary to create such broadband cubes ( e.g. we need a cube for which we have established that the star is on the same spaxel , albeit unknown , at each wavelength ) .",
    "in such an image both speckles and fiducial spots appear as radially elongated structures , which all point toward the stellar position , somewhere behind the focal plane mask .",
    "there are two sources of speckle ( either `` natural '' or satellite spot ) elongation beyond the characteristic scale of the airy dis : adr within each narrow band and low order wavefront errors . precisely estimating the location of a speckle in a narrow band slice would require to model both effects carefully and we did not pursue this avenue in this paper ( this is a complicated exercise that will receive its own scrutiny is an upcoming paper ) .",
    "instead we chose a global approach based on speckles elongation across the entire instrument bandpass .",
    "our radon approach does not estimate the point coordinates to which speckles point _ at a given wavelength _ , it measures the point coordinates from which each speckles move _ across a full cube of narrow band slices_. using p1640 data with satellite spots we compared the global approach discussed below , with more classical methods based on estimating stellar position based on spots centroid in each slices and we found good agreement within @xmath20 th pixel .",
    "+ our first step consists in using a wavelet filter to emphasize the radial structure due to speckles or satellite spots in a broadband image . the cutoff scale of this filter is tuned to the characteristic scale of the structures of interest in the broadband , as shown in the top two panels of figures [ fig : radonwithspots ] and [ fig : radonwithoutspots ] .",
    "+ in order to illustrate how we derive the position of the star based on the information contained in broadband radial structures , we consider the case of an image composed of a finite number of infinitely thin radial lines of length @xmath21 all converging onto the point @xmath22 : @xmath23\\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the slope angle of each line , and @xmath25 the top - hat function and @xmath26 the dirac distribution . in a coordinate system centered at @xmath27 , the radon transform of @xmath28",
    "is given by : @xmath29 = \\\\ & & \\int_{- \\infty}^{\\infty } b_{f}(t \\sin \\alpha + s \\cos \\alpha + x_0 , -t \\cos \\alpha + s",
    "\\sin \\alpha + y_0 ) dt \\nonumber,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the radon transform of the image with the set of radial lines is therefore : + @xmath30 = \\sum_{k = 1}^{n_{lines } } r_k(s,\\alpha)\\ ] ] where the radon transform of a single line is the two - dimensional image shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : radontheory ] and represents the projection of the object along the @xmath31 vector as a function of the angle @xmath32 . in the case of an image defined as a set of radial lines described by equation [ radiallines ] ( i.e. similar to a field of radially elongated speckles centered around the star ) ,",
    "the radon transform becomes a superposition of these patterns for a single line at different phase angles .",
    "the radon transform is therefore mostly concentrated along a suite of bright spots corresponding to the angles orthogonal to the radial features in the image .",
    "when the center of the coordinate system underlying the radon transform corresponds to the location of the star , i.e. @xmath33 , the transform of the ensemble of lines has all bright spots located along the @xmath34 line .",
    "otherwise , the radon transform takes the form of a suite of `` point - like '' bright spots distributed along a trigonometric curve ( see e.g. bottom three panels of figure [ fig : radontheory ] ) . in practice",
    "the radial lines are thick and of finite length ( elongated speckles or astrometric spots ) , but the radon transform remains very localized in the bright cores as shown in figures [ fig : radonwithspots ] and [ fig : radonwithoutspots ] .",
    "the fact that the radon transform maps lines onto points is exactly the property needed when seeking to use an ensemble of speckles to estimate the location of the star in a coronagraphic image .",
    "we thus estimate the location of the star by calculating the radon transform of a given broadband image over a grid of purported centers @xmath27 , and find the location that maximizes the modulus square of the radon transform over the @xmath34 horizontal axis : @xmath35 |^2 d \\alpha.\\ ] ] the bottom panel of figure [ fig : radonwithspots ] shows the contour map of this metric in the case of a generic data cube with fiducial spots .",
    "figure [ fig : radonwithoutspots ] illustrates the particular case useful for this paper , where the star location is solely derived using `` natural speckles '' . in this latter case , because of the noisier nature of the speckles , the constraint on stellar location is less tight than when fiducial spots are present .",
    "moreover , when only using `` natural speckles '' there exist local maxima outside of this region of interest as shown in figure [ fig : radonwithoutspots ] , while in the case of fiducial spots the cost function is monotonically decreasing in all directions away from its maximum .",
    "however , modern coronagraphs such as p1640 provide absolute tip - tilt telemetry that is precise enough to provide a good first guess for stellar location even in the absence of satellite spots . + figures [ fig : radonwithspots]-[fig : radonwithoutspots ] show that the radon transform of broadband images provides a systematic way to estimate stellar location in ifs broadband images and constrain the uncertainties associated with it .",
    "as upcoming direct imaging instruments will use an ifs behind a coronagraph for their high - contrast surveys , this method is relevant to all of these projects .",
    "more general methods for alignment of such instruments can be found in @xcite , who emphasized as well the usefulness of radon and hough transforms for high - contrast imaging calibrations and science .",
    "the radon method can be used both to test the instrument ( e.g. calibrate potential non - common path errors between the differential tip tilt channel and the final focal plane ) and to bolster the astrometric precision of scientific observations .",
    "note that while this method measures the point coordinates from which each speckles moves across a full cube of narrow band slices , residual uncertainties in the stellar locations can raise from speckle elongation within a narrow - band channel ( due to adr within each slice and low order wavefront errors ) .",
    "these effects broaden the thickness of the radial broadband speckles , which , in turn , transfers some energy from the core of the randon transform to its wings . as a consequence",
    "the peak of the cost function in figures [ fig : radonwithspots]-[fig : radonwithoutspots ] is broadened , thus impacting our uncertainties in stellar position .",
    "the comparison of both figures [ fig : radonwithspots]-[fig : radonwithoutspots ] shows why the introduction of fiducial spots is preferable : they constrain the uncertainty associated with stellar location much more firmly .",
    "the uncertainty with fiducial spots is @xmath36 pixel while it is only @xmath37 pixels when carried out with natural speckles .",
    "however the ability to constrain stellar location with such an accuracy without fiducial spots demonstrates the advantages of this promising technique .",
    "when folding the p1640 plate scale , our analysis of the hr8799 data using the `` radon star finder '' yields an uncertainty associated with stellar location of @xmath38 .        in our data",
    "the four planets have respective relative brightness of 3.2% , 3.3% , 2.9% and 3.7% of the mean speckle brightness in their vicinity , aggressive post - processing is required to unravel them in the p1640 data .",
    "contrast limitations due to quasi - static speckle were first discussed in @xcite and a solution involving image post - processing was initially introduced by @xcite , who devised the locally optimized combination of images algorithm ( loci ) . since then , several variations of this approach have been discussed in the literature , either to improve the contrast @xcite or to minimize biases on astrophysical observables potentially introduced by the aggressive speckle reduction algorithm .",
    "this second problem has received particular scrutiny since thorough characterization of the sub - stellar objects discovered by upcoming direct imaging campaigns will lead to significant advances in our understanding of exo - planetary systems .",
    "proposed solutions rely on two concepts : modifying the least - squares cost function that was introduced in @xcite in order to circumvent degeneracies associated with inverting an ill - posed problem , and/or calibrating the remaining biases by quantifying the effect of the speckle suppression on synthetic sources .",
    "three recent papers @xcite suggested that using principal component analysis ( pca ) to analyze direct imaging datasets can circumvent the problem of inverting a low rank matrix and also provides a framework to rigorously assess how much the astrophysical information is impacted by the speckle suppression algorithm . in @xcite",
    "we show two of these pca based methods can accurately retrieve the spectrum of the four hr8799 planets in p1640 data .",
    "since that paper was focused on the interpretation of the spectra we did not delve in the detail of either method , nor on their impact on astrometric estimates . in this section",
    "we describe how to conduct both photometric and astrometric characterization of faint point sources using the klip algorithm @xcite .",
    "the algorithms discussed above all rely on using a large collection of psfs , obtained using one or several observation strategies ( angular differential imaging , spectral differential imaging , reference difference imaging ) and subtracting out the quasi - static artifacts in images by fitting them in the least - squares sense to enhance the detectability of faint astrophysical signal .",
    "this process can lead to two types of biases on the photometric and astrometric estimates of the discovered sources :    * _ fitting bias _ : where some of the astrophysical source signal is considered as speckle noise by the fitting algorithm ( most severe when the inverse problem is ill - posed ) and is mistakenly subtracted , even when there is no astrophysical signal present in the reference psfs . * _ cross - talk bias _ :",
    "when astrophysical signal is actually present in the reference psfs then self - subtraction can occur , leading to further biases in the information associated with these companions .",
    "we identified these two sources of confusion in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we discussed how the fitting bias could be largely mitigated by first transforming the ensemble of reference psfs into an orthogonal basis - set using a karhunen love decomposition .",
    "however our argument relied on the assumption of an ensemble of reference images without any astrophysical signal .",
    "while this is true in the case of the hst - nicmos data discussed in @xcite it is not generally the case for most observations strategies . as a consequence cross - talk bias plays an important role in our p1640 data . in @xcite",
    "we showed how modifying the least - squares cost function and forcing positivity of the fitted coefficients reduces the impact of this bias .",
    "recently @xcite introduced a promising regularization strategy that is based on modeling astrophysical self - subtraction and including it as a penalty term in the least - squares speckles fitting problem . here",
    "we present an alternative approach that builds upon the decomposition discussed in @xcite .",
    "we illustrate its application to the case of point sources detection in integral field spectrograph data , but it can be generalized to any observation strategy and extended objects .",
    "ifs data is composed of a series of exposures obtained at times @xmath39 and at sequential wavelengths @xmath40 : we denote such a data - set as a collection of images @xmath41 , with @xmath42 $ ] , @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath44 is the number of exposures in the observing sequence and @xmath45 the number of spectral channels of the ifs .",
    "we assume here that all images have been centered ( e.g. the relative and absolute centering described above has been carried out ) .",
    "in @xcite we showed how the detectability of faint astrophysical signal could be enhanced in an image using the loci algorithm with a psf library based on rescaled images with the scaling factors resulting from the relative alignment routine . in this paper",
    "we use the klip algorithm @xcite in order to detect point sources in the p1640 data .",
    "we set up the least - squares problem associated with klip as follows :    * the image of interest at @xmath46 is partitioned in a series of search zones @xmath47 centered on pixel located at @xmath19 of radial extent @xmath48 and azimuthal extent @xmath49 . * a reference library associated to each search zone is created : for each radial location @xmath50 in the psf , only a subset of references wavelengths @xmath51 is kept in the library .",
    "this subset of is chosen such that @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the fwhm of the psf at @xmath46 and @xmath54 is a parameter tuned so that it is large enough to avoid self - subtraction ( in practice @xmath55 yields detection maps close to the photon noise associated with the speckles in the raw data ) . *",

    ", the main drawback of this method is that it significantly reduces the number of references available for characterization when compared to the detection algorithm . in the absence of field rotation , we mitigate this effect by choosing strategy ( i. ) described above for blue wavelengths @xmath71 and strategy ( ii . ) for red wavelength @xmath72 .",
    "when using all the cubes from the observing sequence in the reference library we find that in practice this approach yields levels of speckle suppression comparable to the detection pipeline , except for the few wavelengths near the middle of the spectral band - pass . in the case of p1640 , speckle suppression in these few channels are of lesser importance since the middle of p1640 s spectral band - pass is located in the atmospheric water band , for which telluric absorption can not be precisely calibrated given the moderate resolution of the spectrograph .",
    "for future instruments such as gpi or sphere this will be mitigated by the adi observing mode , which will enable to combine the radial offset of characterization @xmath62 zones described above with an azimuthal offset , and thus significantly enlarge the characterization `` companion - free '' reference library .      once an adequate psf library has been set up , with a minimal amount of companion signal in the reference psf characterization zone ,",

    "the reduced image is then : @xmath78 we assume a known model @xmath79 of a point source psf at wavelength @xmath46 with a normalized flux .",
    "under the assumption that the noise in the reduced image @xmath80 is gaussian and of zero mean , a least squares estimator yields unbiased values for the brightness and location of a point source . in order to accommodate for the fact that this assumption might not be true over the entire characterization zone @xmath62 , we can write this cost function over a fitting region @xmath81 .",
    "we find that for our hr8799 p1640 data , a fitting zone that spans the entire characterization zone yields unbiased single channel astrometry and photometry , ( figure [ fig : biases_at_point5mas ] ) . however this might not be the case for other instruments , or for fainter sources in p1640 data . in the general case of distinct fitting and characterization zones",
    ", we solve for the location of the point source @xmath82 and its flux @xmath83 by minimizing the least forward modeling cost function described in @xcite : @xmath84 and where the @xmath85 represents the dummy integration variable for the inner product . since this is a quadratic cost function , the point source coordinates",
    "can be estimated using a matched filter approach , as the location of maximum of the cross correlation between the reduced image and the psf model propagated though the pca filter : @xmath86 with @xmath87 where we have indicated the integration variables @xmath88 and @xmath89 in the terms where the explicit search variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 appear .",
    "once the true location of the point source @xmath82 has been estimated , its flux is then given by ratio of the reduced image - model psf correlation and the estimate of the flux loss due to the fitting bias : @xmath92 equations [ eq : maxcorr ] to [ eq : fluxest ] describe how to take advantage of the klip algorithm to derive the focal plane location and the brightness of a faint point source hidden in under speckles in high - contrast imaging data .",
    "the major conditions for these equations to be valid ( and yield astrophysical estimates that are un - biased ) are that no companion signal is present in the portion of the image used for characterization , and that the residual noise in the fitting zone is gaussian of zero mean . we earlier showed how to build a psf library using ifs data , which _ almost _ satisfies the former .",
    "the ability to reach gaussian noise after adi subtractions was demonstrated by @xcite ; this result remains true for loci- or klip - based subtractions , and can be achieved by choosing adequate geometries for characterization zones and tuning @xmath93 ( e.g. using a thorough parameter search to minimize residual speckle noise as in @xcite ) . in the following section , we test the accuracy of the approach described by equations [ eq : maxcorr ] to [ eq : fluxest ] using a synthetic dataset that strictly satisfies this condition .",
    "then , in section [ sec : astro ] we illustrate how to practically derive astrophysical observables and their uncertainties using our hr8799 dataset , for which the `` companion free psf library '' condition is not strictly true .",
    "in particular we discuss how to mitigate the residual biases that are introduced in this realistic case .      [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in a recent paper @xcite illustrated using hst - nicmos data how overly aggressive psf subtraction could substantially bias astrometric estimates .",
    "we showed on figure  [ fig : biases_at_point5mas ] that in the case of a companion free psf library and a reduced image with zero mean gaussian residual noise , astrometric biases were mitigated when using the klip algorithm . in reality , in spite of all the efforts described above , there is no guarantee that these assumptions will strictly hold .",
    "we thus resort to exploring the algorithmic parameter space in order to identify the configurations for which these assumptions are met as well as possible .",
    "our estimates for spectro - photometry and astrometry of the faint source correspond to the average of these observables over the ensemble of `` well behaved '' reductions .",
    "note however that this is not the same `` blind '' parameter search described in @xcite , since we have identified the main assumptions whose validity we are seeking to test or a given dataset .",
    "we thus vary :    * the geometry of the characterization zone @xmath62 in order to test the residual speckles statistics ( e.g whether or not they are gaussian of zero mean ) .",
    "note that the size of the fitting region @xmath94 could also be varied as well , however we find that for p1640 data changing the size of the geometry of the characterization zone is sufficient . * the parameters @xmath95 , in order to test the validity of the `` companion free '' assumption .",
    "note that varying @xmath54 also impacts the efficiency of the speckle suppression ( and thus the statistics of the residual speckles ) since having more correlated psfs ( e.g. corresponding to a wavelength as close as possible to science wavelength ) generally yields less noisy post - subtraction residuals . *",
    "the number of principal components utilized for the subtraction , @xmath96 which , will impact the statistics of the residual speckles and also provides a very insightful diagnostics tool .    in general , for a given characterization zone geometry and given @xmath95 the behavior of spectro - photometry and astrometry as a function of @xmath96",
    "can be divided in three regimes :    1 .",
    "when @xmath96 is small , the estimated companion s location varies both across wavelength and values of @xmath96 , which means that the psf subtraction is not aggressive enough and residual speckles are biasing the astrometric estimate .",
    "when @xmath96 is large then the companion flux substantially changes with @xmath96 .",
    "this means that some of the companion s flux in nearby spectral channels of interest is actually included in the principal components .",
    "this occurs because the psf library is not completely `` companion free '' . while the small contribution of the companion to the psf library is not captured by the first modes of the karhunen - love decomposition , its influence on the estimated spectrum starts to be more prominent when @xmath96 is large enough .",
    "when @xmath96 is in an intermediate regime then neither the astrometry nor the spectro - photometry vary with @xmath96 : this is the part of the parameter space that is useful to infer astrophysical estimates .",
    "the boundaries between these regimes is a function of the geometry of the characterization zone , of @xmath95 , and of course of the statistical significance of the companion s detection .",
    "we thus execute a parameter space search over 16 different combinations of @xmath97 near the detected location of the companion , and vary the number of eigenmodes in the psf subtraction from 1 to 130 .",
    "this parameter search results in @xmath98 2000 spectra and detector coordinates for each one of the hr8799 planets . from these @xmath98 2000 spectra",
    ", we discard any values that are either in regime ( a ) for which the astrometric position of the companion is not consistent between wavelength channels or ( b ) in which a sharp flux drop is detected with a small change in the number of modes .",
    "finally we further trim the subset ( c ) by only keeping the spectra associated with images that exhibit a _ local _ snr @xmath99 .",
    "note that for this paper focused on astrometry we only consider the h band data , since p1640 detections in that bandpass present the highest statistical significance for hr8799bcde .",
    "note that part of this parameter search could be alleviated by using the t - loci technique developed by @xcite , which adds a penalty term to the least - squares inversion problem to take into account the predicted location of companion s flux in the reference images .",
    "however this requires the use of a template spectrum in order to operate optimally : while it presents a substantial gain by reducing the algorithmic parameter search , it is hampered by the need to test a suite of hypothesis regarding the nature of the atmosphere of the astrophysical source .",
    "here we chose to limit ourselves to methods that _ do not make any assumption on the properties of the detected companion _ and to discuss the trade - offs associated with of spectro - photometry and astrometry in ifs data . while the boundaries of between the regimes ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) can seem ad hoc , the transition between each regime can be easily quantified and the above procedure can be automated .",
    "we have not done so in the early stages of project 1640 , in order to gain insights regarding the synergy between various observing scenarios pca based reduction methods .",
    "our team has now successfully extracted spectra and astrometry of a handful of faint sources four orders of magnitude fainter than their host star @xcite , and we will soon proceed to an automation of this process .",
    "figure [ fig : hr8799bcastrometry ] shows a sample of the ensemble of h band spectra and astrometry for hr8799bc that belongs to the regime ( c ) of `` well behaved '' astrophysical observables .",
    "since they are detected at snr @xmath3 the residual spectro - photometric scatter in this regime in this regime is of the order of @xmath100 which is more accurate than the precision reported by the d - loci algorithm at these levels of contrast @xcite .",
    "moreover , for the channels with the most signal , the astrometric scatter is below @xmath101 pixels ( @xmath102 for p1640 ) , which is quite remarkable given the flux ratios between planets and raw speckles .",
    "we conservatively derive our `` detector based '' astrometric error bars as the standard deviation of all estimates in the regime c ) , over all wavelength in the shaded regions .",
    "the spectro - photometric error bars in @xcite are also derived as the standard deviation of the all the spectra in ensemble ( c ) .",
    "the case of hr8799de illustrates how to estimate uncertainties when the astrometric scatter becomes larger due to lesser signal to noise in the detection .",
    "figure [ fig : hr8799deastrometry ] displays the ensemble ( c ) for the two inner planets in the hr8799 system : the variation of astrophysical observables across wavelength and @xmath103 is significantly larger in this `` well behaved regime '' than in the case of hr8799bc .",
    "this can be easily explained by the necessity to use small values of @xmath54 in order to detect these objects in our p1640 data , which yields a reference library that is more contaminated by residual planet flux at adjacent wavelength . as a final sanity check we overlay on top of the astrometric estimates the radial trace of a putative residual speckle at this location of the focal plane . using this information",
    "we can establish that these are only point sources in their respective neighborhoods of the focal plane whose astrometric signature as a function of wavelength does not follow the radial trace of a residual speckle .",
    "we derive error bars on the spectro - photometry and astrometry in a similar fashion as we did for hr8799bc .",
    "armed with the planets location in detector coordinates , the stellar location in the focal plane , the instrument s plate scale and position angle of absolute north we can estimate the position of the hr8799 planets relative to their host star at our epoch of observations .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the relative astrometry of our epoch are then derived as the root mean squared of the uncertainties associated with each one of these three quantities .",
    "our astrometric estimates , and the error budget associated with them , are shown respectively on tables [ tab : astromety ] and [ tab : errorbudget ] .",
    "for hr8799bc the largest uncertainty stems from our limited knowledge of stellar location in the focal plane ( due to the fact that we are deriving this quantity based on natural speckles elongation instead of using satellite spots ) .",
    "for hr8799de the largest uncertainty stems from the aggressiveness of the speckle suppression that necessary for a statistically significant detection .",

    "recent papers have estimated most likely orbital architectures assuming either a set inclination for the four planets , or coplanar and locked in mean motion resonances orbits @xcite .",
    "on the other hand dynamical analysis can constrain the dynamical mass of the planets ( upon finding orbital architectures stable over durations at least as long as the estimated stellar age ) and can predict near future orbital position . however , dynamical models are generally used in conjunction with strong assumptions regarding coplanarity and mean motion resonances .",
    "it was recently shown , under such assumptions , that one could also include planetary migration mechanisms into a dynamical analysis and thus deliver joint information regarding the planets formation history and masses @xcite . when invoking mean motion resonances to stabilize the system most authors identified the laplace 1:2:4:8 resonance as a promising architecture that is compatible with both the available astrometric epochs and masses in the planetary regime ( @xmath123 ) .",

    "moreover the duration of our calculation is conservatively limited to twice the period of hr8799b ( we assume that in such short time scales the secular perturbations of orbital elements are negligible ) , which is clearly not sufficient to explore all the possible geometries .    on the other hand we find that all of the orbit pair underlying the leftmost panel of figure [ fig : bounds ] feature a close encounter if the masses of hr8799d - e are above @xmath167 .",
    "while @xmath156 boundary might be artificially low due to orbital elements scatter , the lack of stable orbits above @xmath167 indicates that * it is very unlikely that orbits matching the astrometric history of this system will yield dynamically stable configurations unless the masses of at least hr8799de are below @xmath0 * ( unless there remain unidentified pathological biases in our bayesian analysis ) . note that here we adopt @xmath168 as `` planetary mass '' for the sake of the argument , in spite of the boundary in the planet / brown dwarf classification being truly tied to formation history , and thus still an active area of investigation",
    "this is , to our knowledge , the most `` assumption free '' constraint on the dynamical masses in the hr8799 planetary system , since our analysis only relies on the very weak assumptions regarding the _ uncorrelated _ prior distributions of keplerian elements for each planet .",
    "this approach complements the current literature which focused on identifying dynamically stable configurations while assuming coplanarity and/or circular orbits .",
    "in a future communication we will substitute this loose close encounter criterion by full n - body simulations and thus merge both approaches in order to shed further light on the orbital architectures of this planetary system @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have presented a new astrometric perspective on the the four sub - stellar objects orbiting hr8799 .",
    "we relied on the same project 1640 observations that lead to a parent publication focused on their spectral characterization @xcite . in that paper",
    "we demonstrated how the combination of state of the art coronagraphs and adaptive optics systems with an integral field spectrograph could provide tremendous insights on the atmospheric diversity of such purported planets .",
    "herein we first focused on the intricacies associated with astrometric estimation using such a complex system .",
    "in particular we introduced two new algorithms , which respectively retrieve the stellar focal plane position ( even when masked by a coronagraphic stop ) , and yield precise astrometry and spectro - photometry of faint point sources even when they are initially buried in the speckle noise .",
    "this latter algorithm was built upon a recent publication by @xcite and is now becoming a standard tool in the field of high contrast imaging . the principal component analysis underlying our klip algorithm",
    "can moreover be furthered to capture the true three dimensional stochastic nature of the speckles in ifu data , as demonstrated in a future publication reporting a novel method also developed by the p1640 team @xcite .",
    "we hope that our detailed discussions regarding the intricacies of incoherent speckle suppression in high contrast ifu s , and the tenuous tasks of estimating stellar location in the presence of a coronagraphs , will facilitate upcoming large scale surveys .",
    "the second part of our paper was devoted to the interpretation of the published astrometric history of the hr8799 , augmented with our project 1640 epoch . in order to complement the various interpretations currently in the literature we conducted a bayesian analysis based on markov chain monte carlo , using the methods described in . under the caveats associated with the sensitivity of such method to unaccounted astrometric biases",
    ", we were able to determine an ensemble of likely keplerian orbits for hr8799bcde without any prior assumptions on the overall configuration of the system .",
    "we then discussed the implications of our results in terms of orbital architecture , that can be summarized below :    * the four planets appear to be coplanar in the broad sense of our outer solar system .",
    "however hr8799d orbits slightly outside of the plane of hr8799bce , with a misalignment in relative inclination of @xmath169 .",
    "more data is necessary to unambiguously rule out coplanarity .",
    "* it is particularly interesting to note that planet d both appears to have a different inclination , and eccentricity .",
    "if confirmed in the future with additional orbital data , this result would be particularly interesting to help understand the history of the system dynamic , where some event might have pumped both the eccentricity and inclination in a system otherwise mostly circularized and coplanar .",
    "* the majority of recent publications discussing the orbital architecture and dynamical stability of the hr8799 system assumed strict coplanarity for the four planets .",
    "our results raises questions about the validity of this assumption and as a consequence yields updated eccentricities hierarchy and most likely period ratios different than previously thought . *",
    "based on the set of most likely orbits established by our analysis of the astrometric history and a loose dynamical survival argument based on geometric close encounters , we have established a very high likelihood of masses below @xmath0 for hr8799de and illustrated how future dynamical analyses will further constrain dynamical masses in the entire system .    in an upcoming publication",
    ", we will propagate our ensemble of likely orbits through n - body simulations in order to further constrain this likely subset of configurations to the few architecture that both are favored by the data .",
    "this effort will eventually provide robust dynamical mass estimates and , when combined with our low resolution spectroscopic observations will provide a critical piece to the current puzzle associated with the formation history of this system .",
