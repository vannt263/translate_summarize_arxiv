    "classical option pricing theory is based on the hypothesis of a frictionless market in which agents are price takers : there are no transaction costs and traders have no impact  neither temporary nor permanent  on prices .",
    "these assumptions are not realistic , but the resulting option pricing models ( for instance the black - scholes model or the heston model ) are widely used and provide useful results as long as the underlying asset is liquid and the nominal is not too large . however , for options on illiquid assets or for options with a large nominal compared to the volume commonly traded on the market of the underlying asset , execution costs and market impact can not be ignored .",
    "several improvements to the black - scholes model have been made to account for transaction costs .",
    "the basic idea is that high frequency hedging costs are prohibitive due to transaction fees , whereas low frequency hedging leads to large tracking errors .",
    "leland proposed in @xcite one of the first models to deal with transaction costs in the context of option pricing .",
    "other models of frictional markets with either fixed transaction costs or transaction costs proportional to the traded volume include @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "two other routes have been considered to account for market imperfections in option pricing models .    the first route is usually referred to as the `` supply curve '' approach . in this approach , introduced by etin , jarrow and protter @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , traders are not price takers , and the price they pay depends on the quantity they trade .",
    "although appealing , this framework leads to prices identical to those in the black - scholes model .",
    "etin , soner and touzi @xcite consider the same approach but they restrict the set of admissible strategies ( see also @xcite ) to obtain positive liquidity costs and prices that eventually depart from those in the black - scholes model .",
    "we model execution costs ( liquidity costs ) differently because our framework is inspired by the literature on optimal execution ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the second route has to do with the impact of @xmath0-hedging on the dynamics of the underlying asset , and the resulting feedback effect on the price of the option .",
    "an important amount of literature exists on this topic , therefore we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the different modelling approaches . to take account of this effect , we use the same linear form of permanent market impact as in most papers on optimal execution .",
    "in addition to these two routes , a new approach has recently emerged , in relation with the literature on optimal execution .",
    "rogers and singh @xcite and li and almgren @xcite consider approaches inspired by this literature , and similar to ours . in their settings , the authors consider execution costs that are not linear in the volume executed but instead are convex to account for liquidity effects .",
    "rogers and singh consider an objective function that penalizes both execution costs and the mean - squared hedging error at maturity .",
    "they obtain , in this close - to - mean - variance framework , a closed form approximation for the optimal hedging strategy when illiquidity costs are small .",
    "li and almgren , motivated by the swings observed in us stock prices in july 2012 , consider a model with both permanent and temporary impacts , whereas rogers and singh do not examine permanent market impact in @xcite .",
    "they use a mean - variance optimization criterion where the hedging error is the main variable .",
    "they consider the case of quadratic execution costs and use a constant-@xmath1 approximation in order to obtain a closed form expression for the hedging strategy .    instead of focusing on a special case that leads to closed form expressions ,",
    "our goal is to consider a general model .",
    "we use a general form for the execution costs and we examine the influence of permanent market impact .",
    "the optimization criterion we consider is an expected utility applied to final wealth .",
    "therefore , we characterize the optimal strategy with a partial differential equation ( pde ) , and we rely on numerical methods to approximate the solution of the pde and the optimal hedging strategy .",
    "another difference is that we account for interest rate .",
    "furthermore , neither @xcite nor @xcite distinguish physical delivery from cash settlement . in this paper , we show how hedging strategies and option prices are impacted by the type of settlement .    in terms of ( partial )",
    "hedging strategies , both @xcite and @xcite obtain optimal strategies that are mean reverting around the classical @xmath0 .",
    "this is not the case in our expected utility framework : our optimal strategy does not oscillate around a solution without execution costs and market impact .",
    "the optimal strategies in our model are smoother than classical @xmath0-hedging strategies because the trader seeks to avoid round trips on the stock , which entail execution costs upon purchase and sale of shares . in the case of a physical settlement , smooth strategies",
    "are also linked to the fact that the trader is averse both to price risk and to the binary risk of having to deliver versus not delivering . by comparing our strategies with classical @xmath0-hedging strategies for different frequencies of rebalancing ,",
    "we show that our approach makes it possible to reach very low levels of variance while mitigating execution costs .",
    "in particular , we observe that for the frequency of rebalancing that leads to the same level of execution costs , the variance of the pnl associated with our strategy is lower than the one obtained with a classical @xmath0-hedging strategy .",
    "in addition to optimal hedging strategies , our expected cara utility framework provides prices by using the indifference pricing approach .",
    "we compute the amount a client needs to pay to compensate , in utility terms , the payoff of the option when the trader uses the optimal hedging strategy .",
    "we find that the price of a call is higher in the presence of execution costs than in the classical model , and that this price is an increasing function of the illiquidity of the underlying asset and the nominal of the option .",
    "although we concentrate on the case of a call option throughout the paper , the same approach can be used for other types of options . in particular , a similar approach is used to price and hedge accelerated share repurchase contracts ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these contracts are asian - type options with bermudan - style exercise dates and a physical delivery .",
    "the remainder of the text is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the basic hypotheses of our model and we introduce the hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation associated with the problem . in section 3 , we solve the control problem without permanent market impact , and we show that the price of the option satisfies a nonlinear pde . in section 4 ,",
    "we then show how our solution can be extended to the case where there is a permanent market impact .",
    "in section 5 , we discuss numerical methods to solve the problem .",
    "in section 6 , we present the outcomes from several examples , and we compare our model with the bachelier model .",
    "we consider a filtered probability space @xmath2 that corresponds to the available information on the market , namely the market price of a stock up to the observation time . for @xmath3 ,",
    "we denote @xmath4 the set of @xmath5-valued progressively measurable processes on @xmath6 $ ] .",
    "the problem we consider is a bank ( or a trader ) selling a call option on a stock to a client .",

    ", we first introduce the market volume process @xmath10 , that is assumed to be deterministic , nonnegative , and bounded .",
    "the trading is constrained to not go too fast , relative to the market volume , by imposing a maximum participation rate @xmath11 .",
    "the number of shares in the hedging portfolio is therefore modelled as is the number of shares in the portfolio at inception . in illiquid markets , especially for corporate deals including options , the buyer of the call may provide an initial number of shares ( see the discussion in section 3 ) .",
    "we shall consider below the case where @xmath12 and the case where @xmath13 is set to the initial bachelier @xmath0 thanks to an initial trade with the buyer . ] : @xmath14 where the stochastic process @xmath15 belongs to the set of admissible strategies @xmath16 defined by : @xmath17    the market volume process can be used to model overnight risk by assuming @xmath18 when the market is closed .

    "we consider a linear form for the permanent market impact to avoid dynamic arbitrage ( see the analysis of gatheral @xcite ) . the more general framework proposed in @xcite could be another possibility",
    "but we believe it is more suited to intraday problems .",
    "we consider a drifted bachelier dynamics for the price instead of the classical black - scholes framework .",
    "this is also the case in almgren and li s paper @xcite .",
    "the underlying reason for this choice is that we consider a cara utility function which is , _ a priori _ , incompatible with a geometric brownian motion .",
    "the prices we obtain are therefore subject to criticisms when the option maturity is long ( see _ e.g. _ , @xcite for a comparison between the bachelier and the black - scholes option pricing models ) .",
