    "although it has been known for three decades that cosmic - ray spallation is important to the origin of the light elements li , be and b , neither the sources of the cosmic - rays nor their interactions with the interstellar medium are yet well understood ( see vangioni - flam et al . , 2000 , for a recent review ) .",
    "future observations with integral of the nuclear @xmath0-ray line emission that accompanies the light element production could shed new light on this non - thermal nucleosynthesis . the @xmath0-ray line emission at @xmath1450 kev from @xmath2li and @xmath2be production is often detected in solar flares and could be important in the interstellar medium as well . its intensity and profile are evaluated in ramaty et al .",
    "( 1979 ) and references therein . in this paper",
    ", we supplement the work of these authors with detailed calculations of the delayed line emission at 0.478 mev that follows the radioactive decay of @xmath2be to the first excited state of @xmath2li .",
    "we considered a steady state , thick target model ( e.g. ramaty et al . , 1996 ) in which @xmath3be is produced by nuclear interactions of accelerated ions with a neutral ambient medium of solar composition .",
    "we employed an ion source spectrum resulting from shock acceleration ( e.g. ramaty et al . , 1997 )",
    "@xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are , respectively , the momentum , velocity and kinetic energy per nucleon of the accelerated particle of type @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is a high - energy cutoff .",
    "we used @xmath10=2 , which applies to strong shocks .",
    "we considered two different compositions for the fast ions : the composition of the current epoch galactic cosmic - ray sources ( crs ; ramaty et al . , 1997 ) and the average composition of the stellar winds and supernova ejecta from ob associations in the inner galaxy ( ob@xmath11 ; parizot et al . , 1997 ) .",
    "the total cross section for the reaction @xmath12he(@xmath13,n)@xmath2be is from the data compilation of read & viola ( 1984 ) , with the corrections suggested by mercer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to the data of glagola et al .",
    "the total cross sections for the cno spallation reactions by protons and @xmath13-particles are also based on read & viola ( 1984 ) , but we supplemented the data compilation of these authors with the data of epherre & seide ( 1971 ) for the @xmath14n(p , x)@xmath2be reaction , and of lafleur et al .",
    "( 1966 ) and inoue & tanaka ( 1976 ) for the @xmath15o(p , x)@xmath2be reaction .",
    "we see from figure  1 that the @xmath13+@xmath13 reaction is the main source of @xmath2be for @xmath16  mev / nucleon .",
    "we show in  4 that such low values of @xmath9 provide the most favourable cases for observing the predicted @xmath0-ray line emission with integral .",
    "we therefore concentrate in this paper on the @xmath0-ray line production by @xmath13+@xmath13 reactions .",
    "the differential cross section for the production of @xmath2be with recoil energy @xmath17 can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total cross section for the reaction @xmath12he(@xmath13,n)@xmath2be , @xmath20 is a kinematic factor and @xmath21 is the center - of - mass angular distribution of the recoil nuclei , for which we adopted the energy - dependent analytical formula derived by murphy et al .",
    "( 1988 ) from available experimental data .",
    "we show in figure  2 calculated energy distribution of @xmath2be ions produced by the @xmath12he(@xmath13,n)@xmath2be reaction .",
    "@xmath3be is a radioisotope which decays by nuclear electron capture only , with a measured half - life for atoms @xmath22=53.29 days ( ajzenberg - selove , 1988 ) .",
    "it decays with 10.35  % probability to the first excited state of @xmath3li , thus producing @xmath0-ray line emission at 0.478 mev .",
    "the decay rate depends on the @xmath3be atomic charge and a fully ionized ion can only decay by highly improbable nuclear electron capture from continuum states .",
    "thus , its half - life in the interstellar medium is very long , @xmath2310@xmath24 years ( see bahcall , 1962 , eq .  20 ) , so that it is stable as compared with the age of the universe .",
    "the decay rates , @xmath25 , for @xmath3be ions with @xmath26 bound electrons are given by @xmath27 here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the decay rates from the two 1s and the two 2s electrons , respectively ; @xmath30=@xmath31=3.31  % ( hartree & hartree , 1935 ) ; @xmath32=4 is the @xmath3be nuclear charge ; and the shielding constants @xmath33=0.3 , @xmath34=0.85 and @xmath35=0.35 ( slater , 1930 ) take into account the screening of the nuclear charge by the inner electrons .",
    "the recoil velocity of @xmath2be nuclei produced by the @xmath12he(@xmath13,n)@xmath2be reaction ( see figure  2 ) is greater than the orbital velocity of the two electrons of the @xmath12he target atoms . electron capture into @xmath2be atomic states during the nuclear reaction is thus improbable and we assumed in good approximation that the @xmath2be ions are produced fully ionized . as they slow down by atomic collisions , they capture one or more bound electrons and then decay to @xmath2li .",
    "thus , it produces a @xmath0-ray line at 0.478 mev , which profile depends on the energy distributions of the @xmath2be@xmath36 ions in the region where they propagate .      in a steady state model , the equilibrium spectra of @xmath3be ions with @xmath26 electrons , @xmath37 , satisfy a set of coupled differential equations of propagation given by @xmath38 }   + \\dot{q}_7^{(n ) } - \\lambda^{(n ) } n_7^{(n)}~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath39 is the energy loss rate of @xmath3be@xmath36 ; @xmath40 is the number density of species @xmath41 in the ambient medium ; @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the electron capture ( i.e. charge exchange ) and ionization cross sections for @xmath3be ions with @xmath26 electrons interacting with neutral atoms of type @xmath41 ; @xmath44 is the energy spectrum of @xmath3be@xmath36 ions injected into the propagation region ( we assumed that @xmath45 for @xmath46 ) ; and @xmath25 is given by eqs .",
    "( 3 - 6 ) .",
    "we calculated the charge exchange and ionization cross sections as in tatischeff et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "we solve numerically equation  ( 7 ) using fifth - order runge - kutta method ( press et al . ,",
    "boundary conditions are provided by the assumptions that at sufficiently high energies ( in practice , we used @xmath47  mev / nucleon ) , @xmath2be ions are fully ionized ( @xmath48 for @xmath46 ) and both charge exchange and radioactive decay are negligible . equation  ( 7 ) then reduces to @xmath49 which admits the solution ( e.g. parizot & lehoucq , 1999 ) @xmath50    calculated equilibrium spectra are shown in figure  3a for the differential @xmath2be production rate of figure  2 and for an ambient hydrogen density of 10@xmath51 @xmath52 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath2be ions decay when possessing one or two bound electrons , as @xmath53 is significantly greater than the characteristic rate for @xmath2be@xmath54 ions to capture a third electron . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed that the ambient medium constituents are atomic species , although such relatively high density is typical of h@xmath55 regions .",
    "however , it is a sufficient approximation at this stage , because @xmath2be ions capture electrons by colliding mainly with ambient he and heavier elements .",
    "the differential @xmath0-ray line production rate following @xmath2be decay is obtained from @xmath56 where @xmath57=10.35  % is the branching ratio to the first excited state of @xmath2li .",
    "the results are shown in figure  3b for five values of @xmath58 and for the differential @xmath2be production rate of figure  2 .",
    "we see that for @xmath59  @xmath52 , the differential @xmath0-ray production rate depends on the density of the @xmath2be propagation region .",
    "this is not the case for @xmath60  @xmath52 , because the @xmath0-ray line is then produced by the decay of @xmath2be@xmath61 ions , which do not loose significant energy after having captured one electron .",
    "the energy of emitted photons is related to the kinetic energy of excited @xmath2li * nuclei , @xmath62 , by the usual doppler formula .",
    "we assumed the @xmath0-ray emission to be isotropic in the @xmath2li * rest frame and neglected in good approximation the recoil of the @xmath3li * nuclei during neutrino emission ( @xmath63  mev ) , so that @xmath64 . calculated profiles of the 0.478 mev line from @xmath2be decay are shown in figure  4 , together with the prompt @xmath0-ray line emission from the reactions @xmath12he(@xmath13,@xmath65)@xmath2be and @xmath12he(@xmath13,@xmath66)@xmath2li .",
    "we calculated the latest in the same steady state , thick target interaction model as for the @xmath2be production ( see   2 ) and from the total and differential cross sections given in murphy et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and references therein .",
    "we assumed the angular distribution of the accelerated @xmath13-particles to be isotropic , which leads to relatively broad , prompt @xmath0-ray lines ( @xmath67  % ) .",
    "these lines blend to form a broad emission feature ( fwhm@xmath68120 kev ) with a narrower enhancement at the center .",
    "unlike the prompt emission , the profile of the delayed line at 0.478 mev depends on the ambient medium density , as @xmath3be ions decay at lower energies in denser propagation regions .",
    "although the delayed emission accounts for @xmath110  % of the total @xmath0-ray line production , we see that the @xmath0-ray spectra are significantly modified for different values of @xmath58 . thus , the prominent feature at @xmath1460 kev has a width of @xmath150 kev for @xmath69  @xmath52 , against @xmath120 kev for @xmath70  @xmath52 .",
    "both spi and ibis have potentially sufficient energy resolution to distinguish between these two emissions .",
    "therefore , future fine spectroscopic analyses of the emission profile could in principle allow to better understand the complex interactions of low - energy cosmic - rays with dense molecular clouds .",
    "ramaty et al . ( 1997 ) have shown that the observation of the quasi linear correlation between be and fe abundances in low metallicity stars implies that the current epoch , galaxy - wide @xmath71be production rate is @xmath72  atoms s@xmath73 .",
    "this result does not depend on the origin of the @xmath71be - producing cosmic - rays , which is not well understood .",
    "figure 5 shows predicted @xmath0-ray line fluxes at @xmath1450 kev ( both prompt and delayed emissions ) from the central radian of the galaxy , assuming that fast particles with crs or ob@xmath11 composition and with source spectrum resulting from strong shock acceleration ( eq .  1 with @xmath10=2 ) are responsible for all the current era @xmath71be production .",
    "we calculated the latest as ramaty et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and also used the same spatial model as these authors . for the prompt @xmath0-ray line emission resulting from the cno spallation reactions",
    ", we simply assumed ( given the lack of experimental data ) that ( i ) the productions of excited @xmath2li and @xmath2be nuclei are equal and ( ii ) 10  % of the total @xmath2be production is accompanied by the decay of its first excited state .",
    "this value is based on a recent measurement of the @xmath14n(@xmath74,2@xmath75)@xmath2be reaction cross section ( j. kiener et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we see that the predicted @xmath0-ray fluxes strongly increase with decreasing @xmath9 , because of the higher contribution of @xmath13+@xmath13 reactions , which do not produce @xmath71be nuclei",
    ". however , ramaty et al . (",
    "1997 ) have argued from energetic arguments that the galaxy - wide @xmath71be production can not be due to low - energy cosmic - rays with @xmath76 50  mev / nucleon .",
    "we thus predict that if @xmath2li and @xmath71be are indeed produced by the same cosmic - rays , the @xmath1450 kev nuclear line emission from the central radian of the galaxy should not exceed @xmath1@xmath77 photons @xmath78 s@xmath73 .",
    "this galactic background may be difficult to observe with integral .",
    "however , it does not preclude a possible detection of the @xmath1450 kev line emission from nearby , active regions , such as cygnus , vela or orion .",
