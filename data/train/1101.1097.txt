    "we studied the dynamical stability of hd 37124 by combining the radial velocity data with markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analyses to obtain ensembles of masses , semimajor axes , eccentricities , and orbital angles consistent with the rv data .",
    "these ensembles were generated without regard to dynamical stability considerations .",
    "we then imposed line - of - sight and relative inclination distributions on these sets of parameters . by incorporating the unknown inclination parameters with observation - derived parameters , we sampled the entire phase space of orbital parameters .",
    "we subsequently ran n - body simulations on each element in these ensembles in order to assess each system s stability and resonant evolution .",

    "we also incorporated the effects of general relativity in the code , which could have profound consequences for multi - planet system stability @xcite , although the effect is likely to be negligible in this system .",

    "the figure demonstrates that other mcmc fits with outer planet periods in the resonant range are either unstable , or stable but non - resonant .",
    "the architecture of these systems ( as defined by , e.g. , the mean longitude and longitude of pericenter ) do not allow them to settle into resonance even though the outer planet period might favor resonance .    because of finite sampling , our definition of `` resonance '' in this analysis comes from consideration of the rms deviation of each resonant angle about each of @xmath49 , which includes common libration centers .",
    "we flag systems as `` resonant '' if at least one of these angles has rms under @xmath50 for @xmath51 myr , the entire duration of our simulations .",
    "below , we refer to this value as a `` libration rms '' .",
    "hd 37124 presents a clear initial choice of angles to test for libration . as indicated by fig .",
    "[ mcmc ] , the semimajor axis ratio of planets c and d is suggestive of a @xmath41:@xmath42 mmr .",
    "therefore , we sampled the following angles for libration :    @xmath52    @xmath53    and found that @xmath54 librates in @xmath55 of cases , while @xmath56 librates in @xmath57 of cases .",
    "further , the systems for which @xmath56 is resonant are a subset of those for which @xmath54 is resonant .    if we tighten our definition of resonance to include only those systems with rms resonant angles under @xmath58 , then no @xmath56 arguments are resonant . under this stricter definition ,",
    "the @xmath54 arguments are only resonant in @xmath59 of cases , and if we further tighten the libration criterion to an rms of or @xmath60 , then this number decreases to @xmath61 .",

    "inspection reveals , however , that these instances of libration are more indicative of long period ( @xmath67 myr ) circulation .    additionally , the semimajor axis ratio of planets b and c could indicate the presence of a @xmath68:@xmath42 mmr .",
    "therefore , we sampled all angles of the form @xmath69 , where @xmath70 . none of the coplanar prograde systems exhibited libration of any of the @xmath68:@xmath42 angles between planets `` b '' and `` c '' over 10 myr . however , preliminary sampling of these angles over intervals of @xmath41 myr does occasionally exhibit libration rms s close to @xmath50 . because the period ratios between planets c and d may skirt the @xmath71:@xmath72 pc , we also tested the @xmath73 angles , where @xmath74 , but found no instances of libration .",
    "having analyzed the coplanar prograde bin , we can now consider the case where the planets have nonzero mutual inclinations .",
    "we used rejection sampling to obtain triplets of @xmath26 values such that the system is placed into one of 144 bins according to the relative inclination between planets @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath75 ) and planets @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( @xmath76 ) . in no two bins were the same ensemble of initial conditions used .",
    "we binned relative inclinations in intervals of @xmath77 , and used stratified sampling in order to obtain a uniform number of samples per bin .",
    "we initially sampled 100 initial system states per bin .",
    "for those bins where we found more than one system to be stable , we added 200 additional ensembles of initial conditions    by considering the fraction of stable systems in the non - coplanar cases , we can obtain a broader dynamical portrait of this system .",

    "[ stab ] shows that the system _ must be roughly coplanar _ , with relative inclinations less than @xmath79 , in order to be stable .",
    "this constraint allows various pairs of planets to harbor retrograde orbits .",
    "we also performed limited resonant testing for systems in these bins .",
    "the fraction of total systems which exhibit libration of @xmath54 and @xmath56 under @xmath50 for 10 myr is given by fig .",
    "[ restables ] . @xmath41:@xmath42",
    "resonant systems occur , therefore , generally at the few percent level , and most likely when all planets are coplanar with prograde orbits .",
    "as @xcite showed for the gj 876 system , even the most well - established and deepest mean - motion resonances can prove illusory if additional planets are found in the system ( although in that case it appears that the resonance still present , albiet considerably shallower and more complex than previously thought ) .",
    "even for truly resonant systems , a demonstration of resonance can be difficult .",
    "for instance , triple - planet systems may feature two planets with a mostly - librating resonant argument that occasionally circulates due to interactions with the third planet . near separatrix behavior ( as in the case of @xmath2 and ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can also make libration and circulation essentially indistinguishable .",

    "if this is more than would be expected simply by chance , we have performed two tests .    in the first test , we randomly drew pairs of periods from the 340 rv - discovered planets in the exoplanet orbit database ( eod ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pasp submitted ) , and rejected those pairs with period ratios @xmath90 ( corresponding to the smallest @xmath80 among real multiplanet systems ) .",
    "we counted the fraction of remaining systems with @xmath80 within 0.05 of an integer or half integer @xmath91 ( corresponding to the largest apparent pc in table  [ mmr ] ) .",
    "we found that only 4% of our random pairs satisfy our apparent pc criterion , far smaller than the 30% of double - planet systems actually found in apparent pcs .    in the second test",
    ", we included the effects of triple and higher - multiple systems by randomly assigning periods from the eod to all planets in real multiple systems ( again subject to the constraint that no pair of planets in the system have @xmath90 ) .",
    "we found 16% of these artificial systems passed our apparent pc criterion , reflecting the higher number of planet pairs available to test per star compared to our first test . despite this inflation",
    ", the actual value of 33% among all multiplanet systems is still significantly higher .",
    "these results underscore that the orbital periods of the population of planets known to be in multiplanet systems is inconsistent with the apparently - singleton sample @xcite .",
    "this apparently high percentage of known multi - planet systems with an apparent pc might favor particular formation mechanisms .",
    "planet - planet scattering , planetesimal disk migration , and gas disk migration have all been shown to produce systems with at least one pair of planets that not only are commensurate in period , but also resonant .",
    "@xcite found that planet - planet scattering produced mmrs in roughly 5% of the systems that they simulated , and @xcite discovered that between 50% - 80% of systems undergoing planetesimal disk migration yielded resonant capture .",
    "convergent gas disk migration , the thrust of the numerous papers cited in  [ intro ] can occur with near 100% efficiency for certain initial planetary and disk parameters .",
    "as observed by @xcite and @xcite , the inclination may be excited as well as the eccentricity in many resonant cases .",
    "if a resonance exists in hd 37124 , it could have been produced by any of these methods . if the rms libration of such a resonance is representative of the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ res23 ] and has a value that approaches 90 degrees , then planet - planet scattering is a likely origin of this resonance .",
    "alternatively , disk or gas migration would likely produce a system that is `` deeper '' in resonance , with a smaller variation in resonant angle , similar to the top panel of fig .",
    "[ res23 ] .",
    "resonant librating angles need not involve the eccentricities and pericenters , but instead the inclinations and longitudes of ascending nodes , similar to the @xmath92:@xmath41 mimas - tethys resonance in the saturnian system @xcite .",
    "we have resolved the period ambiguity of hd 37124 @xmath8 from @xcite and find that hd 37124 @xmath7 and @xmath8 are in an apparent 2:1 period commensurability .",
    "our numerical integrations show that both resonant and non - resonant configurations are consistent with the radial velocity data , and that stability requires a nearly circular orbit ( @xmath93 ) for the @xmath8 component .",
    "our stability analysis shows that the system must be nearly coplanar , and that the three planets have identical minimum masses within the errors ( of 310% ) .",
    "we show that the roughly one in three well - characterized multiplanet systems shows an apparent period commensurability , which is more than a nave estimate based on randomly drawing periods from the known exoplanet population would suggest .",
    "this offers evidence for some particular proposed scattering and migration mechanisms , and we suggest that the statistics of multiplanet systems may now be sufficiently robust to provide a test and comparison of models of exoplanetary dynamical evolution .",
