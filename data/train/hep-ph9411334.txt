    "an important aspect of the standard model of strong and electroweak interactions is the prediction of a phase transition at high temperatures , where the electroweak symmetry is restored @xcite .",
    "this transition is a direct consequence of the higgs mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it is of great cosmological importance because baryon - number violating processes come into thermal equilibrium as the temperature approaches the critical temperature of the transition @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", the present value of the baryon asymmetry of the universe has finally been determined at the electroweak transition .",
    "the dynamics of the electroweak phase transition has recently been studied in detail by means of perturbation theory @xcite-@xcite and lattice monte carlo simulations @xcite-@xcite . as a first step towards the treatment of the full standard model , the pure su(2 ) higgs model",
    "is usually investigated , neglecting the effects of fermions and the mixing between photon and neutral vector boson .",
    "so far we know that the transition is weakly first - order for higgs masses @xmath4 small compared to the vector boson mass @xmath5 .",
    "already several years ago it has been shown by lattice simulations that the transition is consistent with a crossover for very large higgs masses @xcite . however , for higgs masses @xmath6 the strength , and even the nature of the transition are not yet known .",
    "since the mass of the physical higgs boson may very well be close to or larger than the w - boson mass , it is crucial to improve our understanding of the transition in this mass range .    at high temperatures the su(2 )",
    "higgs model in four dimensions can be approximated by an effective three - dimensional theory @xcite .",
    "in fact , the order of the transition and the properties of the symmetric phase are essentially determined by the quanta with matsubara frequency zero , i.e. , by the three - dimensional theory .",
    "also , the size of non - perturbative effects is related to the confinement scale of the three - dimensional gauge theory @xcite-@xcite and , based on confinement in three dimensions , it has been suggested that the transition between the higgs phase and the symmetric phase can only be of first - order or a crossover@xcite .",
    "hence , one may hope to gain insight into the nature of the phase transition at large higgs masses by exploring directly the higgs model in three dimensions .",
    "the connection between this theory and the high - temperature expansion of the higgs model in four dimensions has already been investigated in detail in perturbation theory @xcite,@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall attempt to study some non - perturbative aspects of the higgs model in three dimensions by means of gap equations . in the higgs phase as well as in the symmetric phase one",
    "expects non - zero masses for both , the vector boson and the higgs boson . on the contrary , in perturbation theory the vector boson mass vanishes at any finite order in the symmetric phase",
    "this suggests to perform an improved loop expansion using masses which are self - consistently determined . in a similar way",
    ", finite - temperature perturbation theory requires a resummation of plasma mass effects",
    ".    our guiding principle in the derivation of gap equations for higgs boson and vector boson masses will be the preservation of gauge invariance .",
    "as we shall see , this requires a vertex resummation in addition to the mass resummation in a unique way .",
    "the resulting gap equations have solutions which can be associated with the higgs phase and the symmetric phase , respectively . using perturbative matching equations , which relate the three - dimensional higgs model and the four - dimensional higgs model in the high temperature limit",

    ". since the masses are rather small , the one - loop result may not be reliable quantitatively .",
    "however , the qualitative feature that the masses in the symmetric phase are smaller than the ones in the higgs phase is in accord with the mass predictions deep in the symmetric phase where the loop expansion parameter is small ( cf .",

    "this suggests that in the symmetric phase the dynamics of the vector bosons is rather independent of the higgs field , and described by the effective lagrangian [ leff ] l_eff & = & 14 _ _ + 12 ( _ _ ) ^2 + 12m^2_^2 + & & + 12(_)^2 + 2m^2 ^ 2 + _ _ + m^2 + & & + g2 ( _ ) _",

    "since the lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) yields the correct vector boson mass in the symmetric phase , it may also be an appropriate starting point for evaluating the rate of baryon- and lepton - number changing processes .",
    "hence , our results support previous work on @xmath119-violation in the symmetric phase @xcite .    in the previous section we found that the first - order transition changes to a crossover at a critical value of the scalar coupling , @xmath120 . for the quoted parameters from ref .",
    "@xcite this correponds to a critical higgs mass @xmath121 gev .",
    "this value strongly depends on the size of the vector boson mass in the symmetric phase .",
    "if , for instance , two - loop corrections would reduce the one - loop value , @xmath122 , by @xmath123 to @xmath124 , the critical higgs mass would increase to @xmath125 gev .",
    "hence , from our approach we can only conclude that the change from a first - order transition to a crossover should take place for higgs masses below 100 gev .",
    "this is compatible with results from lattice calculations for the su(2 ) higgs model in four dimensions at high temperature @xcite , as well as for the reduced three - dimensional theory @xcite , where evidence for a first - order transition at @xmath86 is claimed .",
    "many features of the electroweak transition , as described in this section , are similar to effects of a `` magnetic mass '' , which have been discussed previously @xcite,@xcite .",

    "for @xmath128 the corresponding critical higgs mass is @xmath129 gev .",
    "the weakness of the electroweak phase transition for higgs masses @xmath6 again raises the question of how the transition actually takes place and how important subcritical bubbles @xcite are as compared to the nucleation and growth of critical bubbles .",
    "in the previous sections we have derived gauge independent gap equations for vector boson and higgs boson masses , and we have found different solutions of these equations whose properties depend on the dimensionless parameters of the theory , @xmath13 and @xmath12 .",
    "the presence of a higgs doublet of scalar fields turned out to be crucial to obtain gauge independent equations .",
    "for the pure su(2 ) gauge theory no gauge independent equation could be found .",
    "two kinds of solutions of the gap equations were found , with large and small vacuum expectation values @xmath70 of the higgs field , which could be associated with the higgs phase and the symmetric phase of the theory , respectively . in the higgs phase the obtained masses for vector boson and higgs boson are in agreement with ordinary perturbation theory . in the symmetric phase ,",
    "a non - perturbative vector boson mass is generated whose value is rather independent of @xmath12 and @xmath13 . except for a small range of @xmath12 close to the phase transition point ,",
    "higgs boson and vector boson masses are large enough to yield a sufficiently small loop expansion parameter .",
    "hence , we expect that the properties of the symmetric phase obtained at one - loop order will not be qualitatively changed by higher order corrections .",
    "the obtained masses in the symmetric phase appear to be at variance with recent measurements of lattice simulations , a puzzle which can be resolved by considering larger lattices .",
    "an intriguing aspect of the picture emerging from the gap equations is the difference between the scalar couplings in the symmetric phase and the higgs phase , respectively .",
    "the resummed scalar coupling @xmath130 in the symmetric phase near @xmath23 is very small , which is related to the large ratio of vector boson and higgs boson masses .",
    "a similar behaviour of the scalar coupling is suggested by the renormalization group equations in @xmath100 dimensions .",
    "the nature of the transition between higgs phase and symmetric phase depends on the value of the scalar coupling @xmath0 . below a critical coupling @xmath1",
    "we find a first - order transition , which changes to a crossover at @xmath131 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath1 is strongly correlated with the size of the vector boson mass in the symmetric phase .",
    "based on the perturbative matching between the three - dimensional theory and the high - temperature expansion of the four - dimensional theory the critical higgs mass @xmath2 , corresponding to the critical coupling @xmath1 , is estimated to be smaller than 100 gev .",
    "the guiding principle in the design of a resummation procedure for masses and vertices leading to the gap equations has been the preservation of gauge invariance .",
    "the result has a very simple interpretation . the lagrangian with resummed masses and couplings is nothing but the ordinary higgs model with modified parameters , shifted around the corresponding `` classical '' minimum .",
    "hence , the `` symmetric '' phase is again a higgs phase , just with different parameters .",
    "these parameters are determined self - consistently at one - loop order , like the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field in the case of coleman - weinberg type symmetry breaking by radiative corrections .",
    "hence , no `` symmetry restoration '' takes place at high temperatures , the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field is always non - zero .",
    "this result is in accord with the known property of the higgs model to have only one phase .",
    "the solutions of the gap equations provide a clear physical picture of the symmetric phase and the transition between higgs phase and symmetric phase .",
    "more work is needed to prove the stability of the one - loop results with respect to higher order corrections and to understand the connection between the small masses obtained from the gap equations and the mass spectrum measured with lattice simulations .",
    "the results of these further investigations will be of crucial importance for achieving a full understanding of the electroweak phase transition and its implications for the cosmological baryon asymmetry .",
