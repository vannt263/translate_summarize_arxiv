    "a graph dynamical system consists of @xmath0 an underlying graph @xmath1 where each vertex has a state from a finite set @xmath2 , @xmath3 a sequence of vertex functions that updates each vertex state as a function of its neighbors , and @xmath4 an update sequence that prescribes how to compose the functions to get the global dynamical system map .",
    "examples of graph dynamical systems in the literature include systems with synchronous update such as cellular automata  @xcite and boolean networks  @xcite , those with asynchronous updates , e.g. , sequential dynamical systems  @xcite and functional linkage networks  @xcite , and many probabilistic versions of the above systems . in this article",
    ", we focus on systems with asynchronous schedules , with the broad goal of understanding the sensitivity of the global dynamics with respect to changes in the update sequence .",
    "first , it is necessary to define what update order stability means , and how to quantify such a concept .",
    "there are many possible answers to this question , and there are vastly different ways to do this based on existing literature . after a brief introduction of the main concepts in section  [ sec : prelims ] , we devote the following three sections to presentations of three different aspects of update sequence stability , each focusing on different properties of the dynamics . in section  [ sec : equivalence ] , we look at the structure of the phase space and its robustness to changes in the update sequence . in section  [ sec : limitsets ] , we analyze the number of attractor cycles that can be reached from a given initial state under different asynchronous update sequences .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : wordindependence ] , we look at the collection of periodic states and how they change ( setwise ) under different update sequences .",
    "many of the concepts described above are scattered throughout the literature , usually studied outside of the theme of update sequence stability .",
    "this paper is the first of its kind to bring these ideas together with this common goal in mind .",
    "it is unrealistic to expect to develop a complete unifying theory of update order stability due to the sheer size , diversity , and inherent randomness of complex systems .",
    "however , there is still much be gained from such a study .",
    "one of the themes of this paper is understanding how certain stability properties are generally correlated with physical properties of the underlying graph , such as edge density .",
    "for example , are systems over sparse graphs or dense graphs more stable ?",
    "not surprisingly , different notions of stability can lead to vastly different conclusions .",
    "we hope that this paper will clarify many of these ideas and set the groundwork for future investigations on the stability of asynchronous finite dynamical systems .",
    "let @xmath1 be an undirected graph with vertex set @xmath5=\\{1,\\dots , n\\}$ ] .",
    "each vertex @xmath6 has a state @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is a finite set ( frequently @xmath8 ) , and a _ vertex function _ @xmath9 that updates its state as a function of the states of its neighbors ( itself included ) .",
    "when applying these functions asynchronously , it is convenient to encode @xmath9 as a _ @xmath1-local function _",
    "@xmath10 , where @xmath11 in the remainder of this paper , we will focus on a class of graph dynamical systems with asynchronous update schedules , called _ sequential dynamical systems _",
    "these systems have a prescribed update schedule dictated by a sequence of vertices @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the set of non - empty words over @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "a _ sequential dynamical system _ ( sds ) is a triple @xmath14 , where @xmath1 is an undirected graph , @xmath15 a sequence of @xmath1-local functions , and @xmath12 a length-@xmath16 update sequence .",
    "the _ sds map _ is the composition @xmath17=f_{\\omega_m}\\circ",
    "f_{\\omega_{m-1}}\\circ\\cdots\\circ    f_{\\omega_2}\\circ f_{\\omega_1}\\;.\\ ] ]    henceforth , we will primarily restrict our attention to the case where @xmath18 , the set of permutations of @xmath5 $ ] , i.e. , words where each vertex appears precisely once . to emphasize a permutation update sequence",
    ", we will use @xmath19 instead of @xmath20 .",
    "all of the concepts carry over to general asynchronous systems under slight modification , though not much additional insight is gained in doing so , whereas the notation becomes more involved and the main concepts obscured .",
    "the _ phase space _ of a finite dynamical system @xmath21 is the directed graph @xmath22 with vertex set @xmath23 and edges @xmath24 for each @xmath25 .",
    "clearly , @xmath22 consists of disjoint cycles ( periodic states ) , with directed trees ( transient states ) attached .",
    "any reasonable notion of stability of dynamics must be coupled with a notion of equivalence of dynamics . for dynamical systems ,",
    "a natural place to begin is with the structure of the phase space , since this encodes the global dynamics .",
    "we present here several different types of equivalence , which vary in what is meant by having equivalent structure .",
    "let @xmath26 be finite dynamical systems .",
    "then @xmath27 and @xmath28 are :    1 .",
    "_ functionally equivalent _ if @xmath29 .",
    "2 .   _ dynamically equivalent _ if @xmath30 for some bijection @xmath31 .",
    "3 .   _ cycle equivalent _ if @xmath32 for some bijection @xmath33",
    ".    clearly , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are functionally equivalent iff their phase spaces are identical , dynamically equivalent iff their phase spaces are isomorphic , and cycle equivalent iff their phase spaces are isomorphic when restricted to the periodic states . for a fixed sequence @xmath15 of @xmath1-local functions , different update sequences give rise to different sds maps , and each notion of equivalence mentioned above partitions the set of all such maps into equivalence classes .",
    "the number of sds maps up to equivalence obtainable by varying the update sequence is a measure of stability .",
    "as we will see , each type of equivalence of dynamics corresponds with a combinatorial equivalence relation on the set of update sequences @xmath34 ( or @xmath13 ) , which in turn is strongly tied to the structure of the underlying graph @xmath1 .",
    "thus , knowledge of the structure of these equivalence classes is central to quantifying update sequence stability , and its relationship to the base graph .",
    "we will summarize this below .",
    "every update sequence @xmath35 defines a partial ordering @xmath36 of @xmath5 $ ] , and this is naturally represented via the set @xmath37 of acyclic orientations on @xmath1 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath19 gives rise to the acyclic orientation @xmath38 of @xmath1 obtained by orienting each edge @xmath39 of @xmath1 as @xmath40 if @xmath6 occurs before @xmath41 in @xmath19 and as @xmath42 otherwise .",
    "the partial order @xmath36 is defined by @xmath43 iff there is a directed path from @xmath6 to @xmath41 in @xmath44 .",
    "if @xmath45 are linear extensions of the same partial ordering , then @xmath46=[\\fy,\\sigma]$ ] , and we say that @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , we have a bijection @xmath48 hence @xmath49 is an upper bound for the number of distinct ( permutation ) sds maps over @xmath15 _ up to functional equivalence_. this bound is sharp ( see  @xcite ) , and it is counted by the tutte polynomial , as @xmath50 .",
    "additionally , the bijection @xmath51 allows us to construct a transversal of update sequences from @xmath34 , rather than considering all @xmath52 update sequences .",
    "let @xmath53 denote the automorphism group of @xmath1 , and define the @xmath54-action on @xmath23 by @xmath55 .",
    "the group @xmath53 acts on the set @xmath56 by @xmath57_\\alpha=[\\gamma\\pi]_\\alpha$ ] . if @xmath15 is @xmath53-invariant ( i.e. , @xmath58 for each local function , and each @xmath59 ) , then two sds maps over update sequences in the same orbit are conjugate , by @xmath60\\circ\\gamma^{-1}=[\\fy,\\gamma\\pi]$ ] ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "this puts an equivalence relation on @xmath34 ( and hence on @xmath37 ) that we denote by @xmath61 .",
    "since conjugate maps are dynamically equivalent , the function @xmath62 is an upper bound for the number of sds maps over @xmath15 _ up to dynamical equivalence_. this quantity , which counts the number of orbits in @xmath37 under @xmath53 , can be computed though burnside s lemma , as @xmath63 here , @xmath64 denotes the _ orbit graph _ of the cyclic group @xmath65 and @xmath1 , ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "we believe this bound is sharp , and have shown this for special graph classes , but have no general proof .      to see how cycle equivalence arises in the sds setting",
    ", we first define a way to modify an acyclic orientation , called a _ source - to - sink _ operation , or a _ click_. this consists of choosing a source vertex and reversing the orientations of all incident edges .",
    "the reflexive transitive closure of this puts an equivalence relation on @xmath37 ( and on @xmath34 ) , denoted @xmath66 .",
    "thus , two acyclic orientations related by a sequence of clicks are @xmath67-equivalent . in  @xcite",
    ", it is shown that if @xmath68 , then @xmath46 $ ] and @xmath69 $ ] are cycle equivalent .",
    "therefore , @xmath70 is an upper bound for the number of sds maps over @xmath15 _ up to cycle equivalence_. this quantity is also counted by the tutte polynomial , by @xmath71 ( see  @xcite ) . as with @xmath72-equivalence , there is a nice transversal for @xmath67-equivalence , arising from the bijection @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the set of acyclic orientations of @xmath1 where vertex @xmath75 $ ] is the unique source .",
    "if additionally , @xmath53 is nontrivial , we can use the action of this group on @xmath76 to impose a coarser equivalence relation @xmath77 on @xmath37 .",
    "this is clear , since dynamically equivalent sds maps are trivially cycle equivalent .",
    "the quantity @xmath78 , which is the number of orbits in @xmath76 under @xmath53 , is therefore a stronger upper bound for the number of sds maps over @xmath15 up to cycle equivalence when @xmath15 is @xmath53-invariant .",
    "to summarize , for each of the following notions of equivalence of sds maps , there is a corresponding equivalence relation on @xmath34 ( and hence on @xmath37 ) :    * _ functional equivalence_. relation : @xmath79 with transversal @xmath37 via @xmath51 ; * _ dynamical equivalence_. relation : @xmath61 with transversal @xmath80 ; * _ cycle equivalence_. relation : @xmath66 and transversal @xmath74 via @xmath81 for @xmath75 $ ] .    in each of these three cases ,",
    "update sequences that are equivalent give rise to sds maps with equivalent dynamics .",
    "additionally , it is clear that functionally equivalent systems are dynamically equivalent , which in turn are cycle equivalent . in the general case where the functions @xmath15 are not @xmath53-invariant , or when @xmath82 ( which is true of almost all random graphs  @xcite ) , @xmath83-equivalence reduces down to @xmath72-equivalence .",
    "the difference between @xmath72- and @xmath83-equivalence only captures special symmetries in the graph . in light of this",
    ", we will focus on @xmath84 and @xmath85 for our discussion of stability , though @xmath86 was mentioned for sake of completeness .    since the functions @xmath84 and",
    "@xmath85 bound the number of sds maps obtainable up to equivalence under different update sequences , they can be considered as measures of stability . computing these quantities is in general , np - hard , since they are evaluations of the tutte polynomial  @xcite .",
    "however , even though we can not compute these functions exactly for large networks , an understanding of the mathematics involved provides valuable insight about update order stability .",
    "for example , consider two extreme cases : @xmath0 @xmath1 is an @xmath87-vertex tree , and @xmath3 @xmath88 , the complete graph on @xmath87 vertices . in the first case , @xmath89 , and in the latter , @xmath90 . moreover , since @xmath72 and @xmath67 are tutte - grothendieck invariants , if @xmath91 then @xmath92 and @xmath93 , i.e. , @xmath72 and @xmath67 monotonically increase as additional edges are introduced to the base graph .",
    "two intermediate cases ( between the tree and complete graph ) were studied in @xcite  the graphs corresponding to the radius-@xmath94 and radius-@xmath95 cellular automata rules . for radius-@xmath94 rules ( functions over the the circular graph @xmath96 ) , there are at most @xmath97 cycle structures for ( permutation ) sds maps . in contrast",
    ", an sds with a radius-@xmath95 rule has base graph @xmath98 , the circular graph where every vertex is additionally connected to its distance-@xmath95 neighbors . in this case ,",
    "though we can not compute @xmath85 explicitly for most graphs , we see a clear correlation between edge density of the base graph and the stability of a dynamical system over it .",
    "thus , using @xmath72 or @xmath67-equivalence as a notion of stability , we can make the general statement : + @xmath100      we conclude this section with an example illustrating the difference between the various notions of equivalence described in this section .",
    "[ ex : running2 ] let @xmath101 , with vertex functions @xmath102 where @xmath103 and @xmath104 for all other arguments . using update sequences @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the phase spaces are shown in figure  [ fig : ex : norce ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=95.0% ]    none of these sds maps are functionally or dynamically equivalent , but @xmath108 $ ] and @xmath109 $ ] are cycle equivalent , as illustrated in the two rightmost phase spaces in figure  [ fig : ex : norce ] . in fact ,",
    "it is elementary to compute @xmath110 , thus the two cycle configurations in figure  [ fig : ex : norce ] are the _ only _ possible such configurations up to isomorphism when @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "another natural measure for update sequence stability is a quantification of how many attractor cycles can be reached from a certain initial state .",
    "there are many ways to develop such a measure  one can compute the average number of periodic states reachable from a random starting point , the maximum number of reachable periodic states , the number of reachable attractor cycles , possibly normalized for size , etc . for general complex networks ,",
    "such computations are intractable , and monte carlo type methods may be an alternative .",
    "however , it is at times possible to estimate or bound such quantities asymptotically . in this section",
    ", we will summarize some recent results of one these measures that was developed to study a the robustness of a gene annotation algorithm that basically uses a threshold sds  @xcite .",
    "threshold functions are common in discrete dynamical system models  @xcite .",
    "boolean threshold function _ on @xmath113 arguments is a function @xmath114 such that @xmath115 when at least @xmath16 of the arguments @xmath116 are @xmath94 , and @xmath117 otherwise .",
    "an sds is a threshold sds if every vertex function is a threshold function .",
    "it is well - known that limit sets of threshold sdss contain only fixed points  @xcite , and additionally , that fixed points are independent of update sequence .",
    "this class plays a special role in complexity theory since in many cases , threshold functions are the most general function class for which problems are computationally tractable  @xcite .    functional linkage networks ( flns ) and the gene annotation algorithm of  @xcite were among the motivations for considering the type of update sequence stability measures discussed in this section .",
    "an fln ( for a fixed gene ontology function @xmath118 ) is a graph where the vertices represent proteins , and an edge is present if two proteins are thought to share the same function , with an edge weight @xmath119 describing certainty .",
    "the vertices are assigned states from @xmath120 denoting whether they are annotated with @xmath118 ( state @xmath94 ) , are not annotated with @xmath118 ( state @xmath121 ) , or if annotation is unknown ( state @xmath122 ) .",
    "each vertex @xmath6 is updated by changing its state to @xmath94 if @xmath123 , where the sum is taken over all neighboring vertices , and @xmath124 is some fixed threshold , and to @xmath121 otherwise .",
    "the algorithm updates the vertices in some fixed order chosen at random , and terminates when a fixed point is reached .",
    "the fln algorithm uses an asynchronous update schedule to ensure that a fixed point is reached ( there may be periodic cycles of length @xmath125 under a synchronous update schedule ) . in light of this convenient choice of update scheme , and the random choice of update sequence",
    ", one would hope that such a gene annotation algorithm would exhibit update order stability .",
    "in other words , the final ( fixed point ) state reached should be robust with respect to changes in update sequence and perturbations of the initial state , in that the fixed point reach has little or no dependence on the update sequence .",
    "unfortunately , such stability can not always be guaranteed . as an example , there are general classes of threshold sdss sharing many of the essential fln algorithm properties , but which exhibit exponential update sequence instability  @xcite for many choices of the initial state .",
    "not surprisingly , such instability strongly depends on the choice of underlying graph .",
    "@xmath20-limit set _ of @xmath126 from @xmath127 is the set @xmath128 of periodic states @xmath25 such that @xmath129 for some @xmath130 .",
    "this is a specialization of the classical definition of @xmath20-limit set to the case of finite phase spaces .",
    "if @xmath131 is a collection of update sequences , then the @xmath20-limit set of @xmath15 from @xmath132 with respect to @xmath133 is defined as @xmath134;x)\\;.\\ ] ] if there are large periodic cycles in the phase space of the sds , then the size of an @xmath20-limit set may not necessarily be too insightful . however , if there only fixed points , as is common in many applications , then @xmath135 is a direct measure of stability that describes how many fixed points can be reached from @xmath132 by choosing the update schedule from @xmath133 . for a set of functions @xmath15 , define @xmath136 this counts the maximum possible number of periodic points that can be reached from any state by variation of the update order .",
    "as in the previous section , we begin by considering two extreme cases ; when the base graph is a tree , and when it is the complete graph @xmath137 . the following result is proven in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be a sequence of 2-threshold functions .",
    "if @xmath1 is the star - graph on @xmath87 vertices , then @xmath138 .",
    "if @xmath88 , then @xmath139 .",
    "additionally , this is extended to the random graph model @xmath140 for ranges of @xmath141 relevant to many applications .",
    "the main result is that for sparse graphs , @xmath142 ( with high probability ) , but for dense graphs , @xmath143 . while these systems are deliberately constructed to possess dynamical instability , they nonetheless offer valuable insight into possible dynamics of such systems . with this notion of stability with respect to update sequence , one can make the following general statement , which is in direct contrast to the conclusion of the previous section : + @xmath144",
    "we come at last to our third and final stability concept for asynchronous dynamical systems , which stems from recent work on word independent systems  @xcite . like cycle equivalence ,",
    "this considers invariance properties of the periodic points of sdss , rather than the transient states .",
    "a sequence of @xmath1-local functions @xmath15 is _ word independent _ if the set of periodic states @xmath145)$ ] is the same for all _ complete words _ @xmath12 ( words over @xmath5 $ ] where each vertex occurs at least once ) .",
    "note that word independence only considers the periodic states as a set , and ignores the orbit structure .",
    "word independence was first studied in  @xcite , where it was shown that most classic symmetric functions such as the logical and , or , nand , nor functions , along with their sums , were word independent , for asynchronous cellular automata ( i.e. , over the circular graph ) .",
    "other common functions , such as parity , minority , and majority functions had this property as well . recently , in a series of two papers  @xcite , we have expanded this study to all @xmath146 elementary cellular automata rules , and classified the word independent ones , which are independent of the size of the underlying ( circular ) graph .",
    "precisely @xmath147 of the @xmath146 elementary cellular automata rules induce a word independent sds over @xmath96 , for all @xmath148 .",
    "the classification of these @xmath147 rules is contained in  @xcite , and the structure is further developed in  @xcite with an analysis of their _ dynamics groups _ , which describe how the periodic states are permuted within these systems as the local functions are applied .",
    "the latter paper additionally contains more general results on dynamics groups .",
    "for example , when the state space is @xmath149 , as is typical in finite dynamical systems research , the dynamics group is the homomorphic image of a coxeter group  @xcite , and for general @xmath2 , an artin group .",
    "the papers above are only the beginning of this line of work .",
    "there is much to be done to better understand systems that fail to be word independent .",
    "invariance of periodic states under different update sequences can be used as a notion of update sequence stability .",
    "this can be further quantified as follows .",
    "when a sequence of functions is not word independent , we can define a measure that captures how `` close '' it is to being word independent , by defining @xmath150\\mbox { for all } \\pi\\in s_y| } { |\\,x\\in\\per[\\fy,\\pi]\\mbox { for some } \\pi\\in s_y|}\\;.\\ ] ] clearly , @xmath151 , with @xmath152 iff @xmath15 is word independent .",
    "this quantity measures how stable the periodic point sets are as a whole , to changes in the update sequence . under this definition , word independent sequences of functions are the most stable . in general",
    ", it is difficult to determine if a sequence of functions is word independent .",
    "though there may exist a correlation between @xmath153 and the topology ( e.g. , edge density ) of @xmath1 , there is no good reason to believe that such a link should exist .",
    "rather , there are many examples of functions that are word independent for all graphs , such as threshold functions , monotone functions , functions with only fixed points , parity functions , and the logical nor functions .",
    "therefore , it is not far - fetched to make the following hypothesis : + @xmath154",
    "this article should raise a red flag for anyone anyone attempting to study and characterize stability with respect to update sequence variation .",
    "we saw how different notions of stability can lead to different conclusions of the relationship to graph structure . in summary",
    ", we looked at three properties of the dynamics and how robust they are to changes in the update sequence .",
    "in particular , we considered :    * the variation of structural properties of the phase space as the update sequence changes ; * the variation of reachable limit sets as the update sequence changes ; * the variation of the sets of periodic states as the update sequence changes .    for each of these notions , we defined natural measures quantifying stability , and then inquired about the relationship between these measures and the structure of the underlying graph .",
    "though such a question is quite open - ended , we began by looking at the extreme cases of sparse graphs ( e.g. , trees ) and dense graphs ( e.g. , complete graphs ) to gain some insight , before considering intermediate cases .",
    "up until now , these three notions of stability have only been studied independently , and moreover , outside of the setting of stability . in this article , we see first - hand how differently they behave with respect to a basic property such as edge density of the base graph .",
    "perhaps there are ways to draw connections between them to paint a more complete picture of stability .",
