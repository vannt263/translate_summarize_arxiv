    "the standard models of particle physics and cosmology do not yet fully describe the neutrino sector , with open questions related to the mass - generation mechanism of the neutrinos , any sterile neutrino partners of the active neutrinos , and their potential relation to the number of relativistic degrees of freedom inferred from cosmology . in recent years",
    ", there has been some experimental evidence pointing towards the existence of additional light ( effectively massless ) degrees of freedom .",
    "in particular , a combined analysis of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data from wmap7 , baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) distances from sdss+2df , and hubble constant from hst yields a weak preference for additional light degrees of freedom ( @xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "when moreover including small - scale cmb data from act or spt , this preference mildly increases to the @xmath5 level ( @xmath6 with addition of act  @xcite and @xmath7 with addition of spt  @xcite ) .",
    "these constraints on @xmath8 explicitly assume that the additional particles are massless , and have sparked further work  @xcite .",
    "in light of new predictions for the anti - neutrino flux from nuclear reactors , global short - baseline neutrino oscillation data now favor the existence of two sterile neutrinos with best - fit masses of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , assuming massless active neutrinos  @xcite ( also see  @xcite ) . instead of analyzing the data with the aim of estimating an upper bound to the mass of an additional thermalized neutrino species  @xcite , we take the existence of two sterile neutrinos with @xmath11 and @xmath12 as a prior assumption consistent with the short - baseline data .",
    "it is our aim to determine how a model with these two additional neutrino species fares compared to the case without them , when including all available and relevant cosmological data .",
    ".we impose uniform priors on the above cosmological parameters .",
    "in addition , we always consider the poisson point source power @xmath13 , the clustered power @xmath14 , and the sz power @xmath15 as nuisance parameters constrained by the cmb data  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we always derive @xmath16 , the amplitude of linear matter fluctuations on scales of @xmath17 at @xmath18 .",
    "we only vary a redshift - independent dark energy equation of state ( eos ) . in this table ,",
    "the first 6 parameters are defined as  vanilla \" parameters . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : priorsnu ]    we examine the impact of the two sterile neutrinos on other cosmological parameters in the vanilla @xmath0cdm model , such as the matter density , amplitude of linear matter fluctuations on @xmath17 scales , and spectral index .",
    "we also explore the impact of extensions of a cosmological model with sterile neutrinos , including nonzero curvature , evolving dark energy , running of the spectral index , and primordial helium abundance . throughout this paper",
    ", we will assume that the two sterile neutrinos are thermally populated as seems reasonable given the large mixing angles of the sterile neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "if this is not the case , then the differences between a model with two sterile neutrinos and one without them will be smaller ( cf .  refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the cosmological influence of sterile neutrinos includes an increase in the effective number of neutrinos to @xmath19 and the sum of neutrino masses to @xmath20 assuming full thermalization . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the effective number of neutrinos is mainly correlated with the matter density and spectral index in a vanilla @xmath0cdm model . in",
    "extended cosmological models , correlations also exist with the helium abundance , dark energy equation of state , and running of the spectral index .",
    "meanwhile , the sum of neutrino masses is mainly correlated with the matter density and hubble constant in a vanilla @xmath0cdm model , along with the dark energy equation of state and curvature density in extended parameter spaces  @xcite .",
    "the radiation content of the universe can be constrained from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) through its effect on the expansion rate  @xcite .",
    "given the standard bbn consistency relation between the set of parameters @xmath21  @xcite , the inclusion of 2 additional neutrinos boosts the primordial helium abundance by @xmath22 when the baryon density is kept fixed .",
    "thus , @xmath23 in standard cosmological analyses when enforcing this consistency relation .",
    "primordial helium abundance estimations from observations of metal poor extragalactic h  ii regions suffer from significant systematic uncertainties ( e.g.  see  @xcite ) . an extensive analysis that attempts to account for these systematic uncertainties gives @xmath24  @xcite , which is consistent with the cosmological estimate at 95% cl ( assuming 5 light neutrinos ) .",
    "this agreement could be tightened by lowering @xmath25 from cosmology , achieved via mechanisms such as incomplete thermalization , presence of a non - zero chemical potential , or post - bbn production of the sterile neutrinos from the decay of a heavy particle species ( e.g.  see  @xcite ) .",
    "we describe our analysis method in section  2 . in section  3 ,",
    "we provide constraints on a @xmath0cdm model with three massless active neutrinos and two massive sterile neutrinos , and determine how well this model fits cosmological data relative to a model without sterile neutrinos .",
    "we further explore to what extent the tension between the two models could be ameliorated by an extension of parameter space including evolving dark energy , universal curvature , running of the spectral index , additional relativistic species , and freedom in the primordial helium abundance ( all parameters defined in table  [ table : priorsnu ] ) .",
    "section  4 concludes with a discussion of our findings .",
    "we employed a modified version of cosmomc  @xcite in performing markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analyses of parameter spaces with sterile neutrinos , using cmb data from wmap7  @xcite and spt  @xcite , luminous red galaxy power spectrum measurements from sdss dr7  @xcite , the hubble constant from hst  @xcite , and sn distances from either the union2 compilation  @xcite or the sdss compilation  @xcite .",
    "we generally impose a cutoff in the galaxy power spectrum measurements at @xmath26 because of insufficient understanding of the matter power spectrum on nonlinear scales when including baryons , massive neutrinos , and dark energy  @xcite . for the same reasons",
    ", we do not include the small - scale power spectrum from lyman-@xmath27 forest data .",
    "the union2 compilation consists of 557 sne , which includes large samples from scp , snls , essence , hst , and older datasets  @xcite , while the sdss compilation consists of 288 sne from sdss , snls , essence , hst , and a set of low - redshift sne  @xcite . for the union2 compilation , we considered the salt2 light curve fitter  @xcite , while for the sdss compilation",
    ", we considered both the mlcs  @xcite and salt2 fitters .",
    "the two fitting methods estimate cosmological parameters in different ways , make different assumptions about the nature of color variations in type ia sne , and employ different training procedures that determine the spectral and light - curve templates  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , mlcs returns the value and uncertainty of the distance modulus for each sn ( marginalizing over model parameters ) , the set of which are then included in the cosmological analysis , while salt2 determines the distance moduli along with cosmological and sn parameters in a global fit to all of the light curves  @xcite .",
    "further , mlcs assumes that excess color variation is entirely due to extinction by dust , and therefore imposes a positivity prior on the extinction , such that it is effectively zero for sne with apparent colors that are bluer than the templates  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , apparently blue sne are assigned negative colors in salt2 , such that the respective luminosities and distance moduli are larger than those from mlcs  @xcite .    moreover , while mlcs trains on a sample of nearby sne , and extends the measured relationship between light - curve shape and color to higher redshift sne , the training procedure for salt2 uses a combination of both low and high redshift data  @xcite . given the systematic discrepancies in rest - frame u - band between the nearby and higher redshift samples , much of the difference in the estimated best - fit cosmology between mlcs and salt2 may further be traced to the respective u - band models determined in the training  @xcite . at present , there seems to exist no consensus on which light curve fitter is the most accurate  ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "for instance , considering wmap+spt+@xmath85+sne , where the sne are from the union2 compilation , the @xmath70 constraint lies around 70  km / s / mpc without an hst prior , and 71  km / s / mpc when we impose the prior with central value around 74 km / s / mpc .",
    "the latter is because the data constrains @xmath70 more strongly than the prior ( such that the error bars on @xmath70 without the prior are about 1.4  km / s / mpc , to be compared with the prior of 2.4  km / s / mpc ) .",
    "this line of reasoning works even when excluding sn data . for the particular case",
    "wmap+spt+@xmath85 , we find @xmath210 ( down from 11.6 ) when not including the hst prior .",
    "we also considered replacing the @xmath85 measurements ( with cutoff at @xmath26 ) with two bao distances from sdss+2dfgrs  @xcite .",
    "considering the combination wmap+spt+hst+bao , @xmath211 ( down from 11.6 ) .",
    "hence , our results are robust to the choice of using the power spectrum or bao distances .",
    "moreover , to obtain a better sense of the quoted @xmath84 values , we note that a universe with @xmath212 is disfavored by @xmath213 as compared to a universe with @xmath214 ( considering wmap+spt+@xmath85+hst ) . for a less extreme case",
    ", a universe with @xmath215 is disfavored by @xmath216 ( with respect to @xmath214 ) .",
    "these @xmath86 values significantly increase when further including sn data .",
    "hence , our sterile neutrino model is disfavored at roughly the same level as a dark energy model with @xmath215 ( when not including sn data ) .    when forcing the 2 sterile neutrinos to be massless , @xmath217 and @xmath218 ( when not including sn data ) .",
    "hence , roughly half of the degradation in @xmath84 and @xmath219 could be captured by increasing @xmath8 by 2 .",
    "we note that adding two sterile neutrinos with a given total mass @xmath220 is preferred to adding one sterile neutrino with mass @xmath221 . for example",
    ", @xmath86 is lower by about 8 when @xmath222 as compared to @xmath223 .",
    "however , for a given @xmath8 , the data prefers the sum of neutrino masses to be distributed in the least number of neutrinos .",
    "for instance , given @xmath224 , we find that @xmath86 is lower by about 4 when @xmath225 as compared to @xmath226 .",
    "the 3 + 2 sterile neutrino model is preferred by cosmology as compared to a 3 + 1 model if the sum of neutrino masses is the same for the two models .",
    "however , the 3 + 2 model is disfavored as compared to a 3 + 1 neutrino model with @xmath227 , at the level of @xmath228 when not including sn data , at the level of @xmath229 when including sdss - mlcs sn data , and at the level of @xmath230 when including union2-salt2 sn data .",
    "perhaps more importantly , even when assuming the existence of two massive sterile neutrinos , we find a @xmath5 preference for an additional massless species .",
    "thus , a model containing 3 sterile neutrinos ( for example , see 3 + 3 models in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is not necessarily ruled out by cosmology , especially if the sum of neutrino masses is not increased as compared to models with fewer number of sterile neutrinos .",
    "however , if laboratory data converge on a @xmath231 or @xmath232 model with a larger sum of sterile neutrino masses than considered here , this model would have a larger difficulty to fit the cosmological data . at about the 2@xmath233 level",
    ", we also note that the extended parameter space model with two light sterile neutrinos shows a preference for super - acceleration ( or @xmath234 )  @xcite .",
    "in fact , this slight preference for @xmath234 also persists in a model ( with the two light sterile neutrinos ) that is enlarged only by this one parameter ( @xmath159 ) .    to summarize ,",
    "we have studied in detail the question of whether two sterile neutrinos with about ev mass each is consistent or disfavored by the latest cosmological data .",
    "while our sterile neutrino model fits each dataset well , in a combined analysis of the cmb , hubble constant , and galaxy power spectrum , we have shown that it is difficult to fit all data better than a null model without these sterile neutrinos .",
    "this difficulty persists even when including additional free parameters in the cosmological model , such as a constant dark energy equation of state , curvature of the universe , running of the spectral index , effective number of neutrinos , and primordial helium abundance .",
    "thus , if laboratory experiments continue to favor a scenario with two massive sterile neutrinos , and that is shown to be at odds with cosmological observations , then one may have to look towards a more exotic cosmological model than explored here .",
    "however , we have also shown that the viability of a sterile neutrino model is critically sensitive to our ability to identify and control the systematic uncertainties associated with the datasets included in our analysis .",
    "in particular , the sterile neutrino model fits sn data better than the null model when using the mlcs light curve fitter and worse than the null model when using the salt2 fitter .",
    "these differences between the fitters can be traced back to different assumptions about the nature of color variations in type ia sne and the respective u - band models determined in the training . in a combined analysis of cmb ,",
    "hubble constant , and galaxy power spectrum data , along with sn distance measurements , we find that our sterile neutrino model fits the data equally well as the null model if we employ the mlcs light curve fitter .",
    "thus , a minimally extended model with two massive sterile neutrinos could be taken to constitute a realistic cosmological scenario , and we advocate caution in interpreting combined analyses of cosmological datasets given their different systematic uncertainties .",
    "global short - baseline neutrino oscillation data seem to favor the existence of two sterile neutrinos with masses close to 1  ev each ( assuming effectively massless active species ) .",
    "we have studied the extent to which these two neutrinos are allowed by a combination of probes including the cosmic microwave background , hubble constant , galaxy power spectrum , and supernova distances . in the analysis of sn data , we considered the impact on our results of both the salt2 and mlcs light curve fitters .",
    "in particular , we showed that the choice of the sn light curve fitting method has a major impact on the inferred cosmological model .",
    "we find that the sterile neutrino model provides a good fit to each of the considered datasets , and no single probe manages to decisively disfavor the sterile neutrino model with respect to the null model . in the joint analysis ,",
    "sterile neutrinos are allowed by the cosmological data ( @xmath235 ) when using the mlcs light curve fitter for the sne in the sdss compilation , and strongly disfavored by the data ( @xmath1 ) when using the salt2 fitter for sne in the union2 compilation .",
    "when excluding the supernova measurements , the sterile neutrinos are disfavored by the other datasets at @xmath2 .",
    "for a 3 + 1 sterile neutrino model , it is conceivable that the tension is ameliorated , but this depends on the mass of the single sterile neutrino . as an illustrative comparison , a cosmological model ( without sterile neutrinos ) that has @xmath215",
    "is disfavored by wmap+spt+@xmath85+hst ( no sn data ) at the @xmath216 level compared to the vanilla model with @xmath214 .",
    "if the salt2 fitter is indicative of the correct way to interpret sn light curve measurements , then reconciling two light ( @xmath236 ) sterile neutrinos ( consistent with results from short - baseline neutrino oscillation data ) with cosmology may require additional freedom in the cosmological model .",
    "however , no single parameter from among nonzero curvature , evolving dark energy , additional relativistic species , running of the spectral index , and primordial helium abundance was able to decrease @xmath86 or @xmath237 close to zero .",
    "in fact , even for an extended space with all of these additional parameters , the sterile neutrino model is mildly disfavored at @xmath3 ( when using the salt2 fitter ) .    the important take - home message , however , is that large shifts in @xmath86 ( @xmath238 ) already occur from subtle changes to the way parts of the cosmological datasets are analyzed .",
    "if sn studies converge toward the mlcs fitter ( as opposed to the salt2 fitter ) , then two sterile neutrinos with masses close to the ev level are easily allowed by the data .",
    "interestingly , even when assuming the existence of two massive sterile neutrinos , we continue to find about @xmath5 preference for an additional massless species .",
    "in addition , in this model with two sterile neutrinos , a much larger matter density would be required ( by roughly 40% ) , which helps preserve the constraint on @xmath77 near the 0.8-mark , in agreement with galaxy cluster abundance measurements .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper shows that it is premature to either rule out the existence of two massive sterile neutrinos or claim this model is cosmologically preferred .",
    "we much appreciate useful discussions with john beacom , ryan foley , jan hamann , ryan keisler , jostein kristiansen , gregory martinez , and joseph smidt .",
