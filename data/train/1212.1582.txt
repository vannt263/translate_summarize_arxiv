    "we consider the free motion of an incompressible viscous fluid in a two - dimensional exterior domain @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a compact obstacle with a smooth boundary .",

    "we suppose that the velocity of the fluid vanishes on @xmath4 and decays to zero at infinity .",
    "the evolution of our system is thus governed by the navier - stokes equations @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote , respectively , the velocity and the pressure of the fluid at a space - time point @xmath8 . as can be seen from the first equation in , we assume that the fluid density is constant and that the kinematic viscosity is equal to @xmath9 .",
    "since includes no forcing , the motion of the fluid originates entirely from the initial data @xmath10 , which we assume to be divergence - free and tangent to the boundary on @xmath4 .",

    "when @xmath22 is bounded , the first results also go back to leray @xcite , but global existence of large solutions was shown only later by ladyzhenskaia @xcite , see also @xcite . to prove theorem  [ thm1 ] , one can use a regularization or a discretization procedure to construct global _ weak _ solutions of which satisfy the energy inequality , and then prove that these solutions are unique and have the desired regularity .",
    "alternatively , one can construct local _ mild _ solutions by transforming into an integral equation and solving it by a fixed point argument , and then use the energy equality to show that all solutions can be extended to the whole time interval @xmath23 .",
    "although most of the literature is devoted to the situation where @xmath24 is either a bounded domain or the whole plane @xmath25 , the case of an exterior domain can be treated without essential modifications , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "it follows from that the kinetic energy @xmath26 is nonincreasing in time , and a result of masuda @xcite shows that @xmath27 converges to zero as @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , under additional assumptions on the initial data , it is possible to specify a decay rate in time .",
    "for instance , if @xmath29 for some @xmath30 , the solution of lies in the same space for all @xmath31 and @xmath32 see @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that fails in the limiting case @xmath33 . indeed ,",

    ".    as an aside , we mention that this loss of spatial decay is related to the net force @xmath37 exerted by the fluid on the obstacle @xmath3 . to see this",
    ", we first observe that any velocity field @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39 . indeed , if @xmath40 is smooth and compactly supported , then using gauss theorem and the fact that @xmath41 on @xmath4 we find @xmath42 the general easily case follows by a density argument @xcite . now , if @xmath43,l^1(\\omega)^2)$ ] is a solution of the navier - stokes equation , then @xmath44 because @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the stress tensor ( we recall that all physical parameters have been normalized to @xmath9 ) .",
    "the formal calculation above can be made rigorous @xcite and shows that , no matter how localized the initial data may be , the velocity field @xmath47 does not stay integrable for positive times , unless the net force @xmath37 vanishes identically .",
    "of course this is not the case in general , but in highly symmetric situations it is possible to construct solutions of for which @xmath48 , and which decay faster as @xmath0 than what is indicated in , see @xcite .",
    "much less is known about the solutions of if the initial data @xmath13 are not square integrable .",
    "although the physical relevance of infinite - energy solutions can be questioned , we believe that such solutions naturally occur when studying the dynamics of in a two - dimensional exterior domain @xmath24 . one way to realize that is to consider the relation between the velocity field @xmath40 and the associated vorticity @xmath49 . given @xmath50 , we denote @xmath51 in other words @xmath52 is the completion with respect to the norm @xmath53 of the space of all smooth , divergence - free vector fields with compact support in @xmath24 , see @xcite .",
    "we then have the following result :    [ bs0 ] if @xmath54 for some @xmath50 , and if @xmath55 , then @xmath56 for almost every @xmath57 . here",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath59 if @xmath60 .",

    "moreover @xmath65 is the extension of @xmath66 by zero outside @xmath24 .",
    "thus @xmath67 can be expressed in terms of @xmath68 using the classical biot - savart law in @xmath25 , and restricting that relation to @xmath24 we obtain .",
    "we emphasize that the representation is only valid if @xmath66 is the curl of a divergence - free velocity field @xmath40 which _ vanishes on _ @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath69 is an arbitrary smooth function with compact support , the velocity field _ defined by _ does not even satisfy @xmath41 on @xmath70 !",
    "we now assume that the vorticity distribution @xmath66 is sufficiently localized so that @xmath71 , and we define the _ total circulation _",

    "but it follows from that @xmath75 hence @xmath76 as soon as @xmath77 .",
    "this shows that finite - energy solutions of necessarily have zero total circulation .",
    "on the other hand , in many important examples of two - dimensional flows such as vortex patches , vortex sheets , or point vortices , the vorticity distribution typically has a constant sign , hence the total circulation is necessarily nonzero . in our opinion , it is thus important to enlarge the class of admissible solutions of , so as to allow for velocity fields which decay like @xmath78 as @xmath12 .",
    "a possible framework for the study of infinite - energy solutions of the navier - stokes equation is the _ weak energy space _",
    "@xmath79 where @xmath80 is the weak @xmath81 space on @xmath24 , see @xcite .",
    "we recall that @xmath82 in the sense that the norm @xmath83 is equivalent to the quantity in the right - hand side of . clearly @xmath84 , but the weak energy space is large enough to include velocity fields which decay slowly at infinity , as in . concerning the solvability of in @xmath85 ,",

    "theorem  [ thm3 ] shows that the cauchy problem for the navier - stokes equations is globally well - posed in the weak energy space @xmath85 , provided that the local singularity of the initial data @xmath13 is sufficiently small , in the sense of . to illustrate the meaning of this smallness condition",
    ", we consider the simple situation where the initial flow is just a point vortex of circulation @xmath95 located at @xmath96 .",
    "the initial vorticity is thus given by @xmath97 , and using the classical biot - savart law in the exterior domain @xmath24 ( see e.g. @xcite ) it is easy to verify that the corresponding velocity field @xmath13 lies in @xmath85 , is smooth in @xmath98 , and satisfies @xmath99 so that is fulfilled if and only if @xmath100 .",
    "this example shows that , if the initial vorticity @xmath101 is a finite measure , condition implies a restriction on the size of the atomic part of @xmath101 .",
    "such a restriction also arises in the analysis of the two - dimensional vorticity equation in the whole space @xmath25 , see @xcite , but in that particular case the uniqueness of the solution can be established when the initial vorticity is an arbitrary finite measure @xcite .",
    "although theorem  [ thm3 ] provides the existence of a large class of infinite - energy solutions , very little is known about the asymptotic behavior of these solutions as @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , we do not even know whether they stay bounded in the weak energy space @xmath85 , because we are lacking a priori estimates .",
    "indeed , if @xmath102 the energy equality does not make sense , and because of the no - slip boundary condition on @xmath4 it is quite difficult to obtain estimates on the vorticity distribution if @xmath103 . in the rest of this paper , however , we consider a particular class of infinite - energy solutions of the navier - stokes equations , for which the asymptotic behavior in time can be accurately described .",
    "in the particular case where @xmath21 , the navier - stokes equations have a family of self - similar solutions of the form @xmath104 , @xmath105 , where @xmath95 is a free parameter ( the total circulation ) and @xmath106 these solutions are usually called the _ lamb - oseen vortices_. if @xmath104 , the corresponding vorticity distribution is @xmath107 , where @xmath108 note that @xmath109 and @xmath110 for all @xmath19 .",

    "approximate oseen vortices can be constructed in the following way .",

    "the _ truncated oseen vortex _ with unit circulation is defined as follows : @xmath119 for any @xmath19 , it is clear that @xmath120 is a smooth divergence - free vector field which vanishes in a neighborhood of @xmath3 .",
    "the corresponding vorticity distribution @xmath121 has the explicit expression @xmath122 where @xmath123 is defined in .",
    "in particular @xmath124 and @xmath125 for all @xmath19 .",
    "moreover , a direct calculation shows that @xmath126 hence there exists a radially symmetric function @xmath127 such that @xmath128 .",
    "now , given @xmath95 , we consider solutions of of the particular form @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the truncated oseen vortex defined in , and @xmath131 is a _ finite - energy _ perturbation . in this situation , we expect that @xmath132 converges to zero in energy norm as @xmath0 , so that the long - time behavior of @xmath47 is described , to leading order , by the oseen vortex @xmath133 .",
    "our main result , which was obtained in collaboration with y.  maekawa , shows that this is indeed the case , provided the total circulation @xmath134 is sufficiently small .",

    "first of all , theorem  [ main ] is a _ global stability result _ for oseen vortices with small circulation at infinity , because we do not impose any restriction on the size of the perturbation @xmath139 . in the particular case",
    "where @xmath141 , there is no vortex at all and we just recover the asymptotics with @xmath142 instead of @xmath143 in the right - hand side . also , in the simple situation where @xmath21 , our result is comparable to that of carpio @xcite , although the proof is very different .",
    "the main limitation of theorem  [ main ] is of course the restriction on the size of the circulation @xmath134 , which we believe is purely technical . in this respect",
    ", the fact that @xmath144 can be taken independent of the domain @xmath24 is quite significant , because we know that there is no restriction on the circulation in the particular case where @xmath21 , see theorem  [ thm4 ] .",
    "obviously @xmath144 is a decreasing function of @xmath145 , and the proof shows that @xmath146 as @xmath147 . thus the limiting case @xmath148 is not included , which means that we are not able to control arbitrary finite - energy perturbations of the oseen vortex ( see however @xcite for a partial result in that direction ) . on the other hand the limit of @xmath144 as @xmath149 can be estimated and is found to be approximately @xmath150 , see @xcite .",
    "we also mention that the decomposition @xmath151 of the initial data is automatically satisfied if we assume that the initial vorticity is sufficiently localized .",
    "more precisely , we have the following auxiliary result , which follows quite easily from lemma  [ bs0 ] .    [ vort1 ]",
    "@xcite given @xmath152 , assume that @xmath153 for some @xmath154 and that the associated vorticity @xmath155 satisfies @xmath156 for some @xmath157 .",

    "this is not immediately obvious , because the classical @xmath162@xmath163 estimates for the stokes semigroup in an exterior domain do not include the limiting case @xmath164 , see @xcite .",
    "however , combining theorem  [ main ] with a relatively standard estimate , which shows that the @xmath165 norm of the vorticity can not leak to infinity , we obtain the following result which is the main original contribution of the present paper :    [ vort2 ] under the assumptions of theorem  [ main ] , if we suppose in addition that holds for some @xmath166 , then the vorticity @xmath167 satisfies @xmath168 where @xmath123 is defined in .    in the rest of this paper , we give a simplified proof of theorem  [ main ] , which does not yield the optimal conclusion .",
    "in particular , we shall find a suboptimal convergence rate in , and our limitation on the size of the circulation will ( a priori ) depend on the domain @xmath24 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a complete proof , including all details . in the last section ,",
